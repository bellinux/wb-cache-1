5000|$|Structure {{detection}} {{forms the}} most fundamental part of NARMAX. For example a NARMAX model which consists of one lagged input and one lagged output term, three lagged noise terms, expanded as a cubic polynomial would consist of fifty six possible candidate terms. This number of candidate terms arises because the expansion by definition includes all possible combinations within the <b>cubic</b> <b>expansion.</b> Naively proceeding to estimate a model which includes all these terms and then pruning will cause numerical and computational problems and should always be avoided. However, only a few terms are often important in the model. Structure detection, which aims to select terms one at a time, is therefore critically important. These objectives can easily be achieved by using the Orthogonal Least Squares [...] algorithm and its derivatives to select the NARMAX model terms one at a time. These ideas can also be adapted for pattern recognition and feature selection and provide an alternative to principal component analysis but with the advantage that the features are revealed as basis functions that are easily related {{back to the original}} problem. NARMAX methods are designed to do far more than to just find the best approximating model. System identification can be divided into two aims. The first involves approximation where the key aim is to develop a model that approximates the data set such that good predictions can be made. There are many applications where this approach is appropriate, for example in time series prediction of the weather, stock prices, speech, target tracking, pattern classification etc. In such applications the form of the model is not that important. The objective is to find an approximation scheme which produces the minimum prediction errors. A second objective of system identification, which includes the first objective as a subset, involves much more than just finding a model to achieve the best mean squared errors. This second aim is why the NARMAX philosophy was developed and is linked to the idea of finding the simplest model structure. The aim here is to develop models that reproduce the dynamic characteristics of the underlying system, to find the simplest possible model, and if possible to relate this to components and behaviours of the system under study. The core aim of this second approach to identification is therefore to identify and reveal the rule that represents the system. These objectives are relevant to model simulation and control systems design, but increasingly to applications in medicine, neuro science, and the life sciences. Here the aim is to identify models, often nonlinear, {{that can be used to}} understand the basic mechanisms of how these systems operate and behave so that we can manipulate and utilise these. NARMAX methods have also been developed in the frequency and spatio-temporal domains.|$|E

A {{quick glance at}} $I-V$ data for molecular junctions suggests a qualitatively similar behavior. This would render model-based studies almost irrelevant, since, whatever the model, its parameters can always be adjusted to fit symmetric (asymmetric) $I-V$ curves characterized by two (three) expansion coefficients. Here, we systematically examine popular models based on tunneling barrier or tight-binding pictures and demonstrate that, for a quantitative description at biases of interest ($V$ slightly higher than the transition voltage $V_t$), <b>cubic</b> <b>expansions</b> do not suffice. A detailed collection of analytical formulae {{as well as their}} conditions of applicability are presented to facilitate experimentalists colleagues to process and interpret their experimental data by obtained by measuring currents in molecular junctions. We discuss in detail the limits of applicability of the various models and emphasize that uncritically adjusting model parameters to experiment may be unjustified because the values deduced in this way may fall in ranges rendering a specific model invalid or incompatible to ab initio estimates. We exemplify with the benchmark case of oligophenylene-based junctions, for which results of ab initio quantum chemical calculations are also reported. As a specific issue, we address the impact of the spatial potential profile and show that it is not notable up to biases V somewhat larger than V_t, unlike at higher biases, where it may be responsible for negative differential resistance effects.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{efficient}} global zigzag theory (GZIGT) {{is developed}} for elastic laminated plates, by approximating the in-plane displacements by a <b>cubic</b> <b>expansion</b> in thickness coordinate {{along with a}} global zigzag function, which takes values 1 at successive interfaces. The deflection is approximated to account explicitly for transverse thermal strain. The displacement variables are reduced to five, the same as used in first-order shear deformation theory, by imposing the conditions on transverse shear at three a priori selected interfaces/faces. A third order theory (TOT 1) is also developed with similar expression of deflection. GZIGT and TOT 1 are assessed by comparison with exact three-dimensional solutions for simply-supported square plates for sinusoidal pressure and thermal loads, natural frequencies and buckling. In general, GZIGT yields good results for two-ply, three-ply and four-ply composite plates, but it is inaccurate for a highly inhomogeneous test plate.

By combining the data into a set of ‘virtual observatories’ (VO) in space, they can mimic ground-based observatories (Barrois et al. 2018; Beggan et al. 2009; Mandea and Olsen 2006). Improved VO calculations used sums and differences of CHAMP along-track measurements to calculate time series at 500 equally spaced VO, based on quiet data selected from all local times, corrected for external, induced and crustal fields (Hammer 2018). Data from within 200  km of the VO were reduced to the central point using a <b>cubic</b> <b>expansion</b> of the potential.

40|$|Networks of Erlang loss queues {{naturally}} {{arise when}} modelling finite communication systems without delays, among which, most notably (i) classical circuit switch telephone networks (loss networks) and (ii) present-day wireless mobile networks. Performance measures of interest such as loss probabilities or throughputs {{can be obtained}} from the steady state distribution. However, while this steady state distribution has a closed product form expression in the first case (loss networks), it has not in the second case due to blocked (and lost) handovers. Product form approximations are therefore suggested. These approximations are obtained by a combined modification of both the state space (by a hyper <b>cubic</b> <b>expansion)</b> and the transition rates (by extra redial rates). It will be shown that these product form approximations lead to - secure upper bounds for loss probabilities and - analytic error bounds for the accuracy of the approximation for various performance measures. The proofs of these results rely upon both monotonicity results and an analytic error bound method as based on Markov reward theory. This combination and its technicalities are of interest by themselves. The technical conditions are worked out and verified for two specific applications: - pure loss networks as under (i) - GSM-networks with fixed channel allocation as under (ii). The results are of practical interest for computational simplifications and, particularly, to guarantee blocking probabilities not to exceed a given threshold such as for network dimensioning. ...|$|E
40|$|Whether at phenomenological or {{microscopic}} levels, most theoretical {{approaches to}} charge transport through molecular junctions postulate or attempt to justify microscopically {{the existence of}} a dominant molecular orbital (MO). Within such single level descriptions, experimental current-voltage I-V curves are sometimes/often analyzed by using analytical formulas expressing the current as a <b>cubic</b> <b>expansion</b> in terms of the applied voltage V, and relate possible V-driven shifts of the level energy offset relative to the metallic Fermi energy ε_ 0 to an asymmetry of molecule-electrode couplings or to an asymmetric location of the "center of gravity" of the MO with respect to electrodes. In this paper, we present results demonstrating the failure of these intuitive expectations. For example, we show how typical data processing based on cubic expansions yields a value of ε_ 0 underestimated by a typical factor of about two. When compared to theoretical results of DFT approaches, which typically underestimate the HOMO-LUMO gap by a similar factor, this may create the false impression of "agreement" with experiments in situations where this is actually not the case. Further, such cubic expansions yield model parameter values dependent on the bias range width employed for fitting, which is unacceptable physically. Finally, we present an example demonstrating that, counter-intuitively, the bias-induced change in the energy of an MO located much closer to an electrode can occur in a direction that is opposite to the change in the Fermi energy of that electrode. This is contrary to what one expects based on a "lever rule" argument, according to which the MO "feels" the local value of the electric potential, which is assumed to vary linearly across the junction and is closer to the potential of the closer electrode...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new set of}} symmetries obeyed by tree-level gauge-theory amplitudes involving at least one gluon. The symmetry acts as a momentum-dependent shift on the color factors of the amplitude. Using the radiation vertex expansion, we prove the invariance under this color-factor shift of the $n$-gluon amplitude, as well as amplitudes involving massless or massive particles in an arbitrary representation of the gauge group with spin zero, one-half, or one. The Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations are a direct consequence of this symmetry. We also introduce the <b>cubic</b> vertex <b>expansion</b> of an amplitude, and use it to derive a generalized-gauge-invariant constraint on the kinematic numerators of the amplitude. We show that the amplitudes of the bi-adjoint scalar theory are invariant under the color-factor symmetry, and use this to derive the null eigenvectors of the propagator matrix. We generalize the color-factor shift to loop level, and prove the invariance under this shift of one-loop $n$-gluon amplitudes in any theory that admits a color-kinematic-dual representation of numerators. We show that the one-loop color-factor symmetry implies known relations among the integrands of one-loop color-ordered amplitudes.

The proteins studied were the green fluorescent protein (GFP); intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP), and adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP), each labeled noncovalently with 1 -anilinonaphthalene- 8 -sulfonate (1, 8 -ANS) and covalently with 6 -acryloyl- 2 -(dimethylamino) naphthalene (acrylodan); and acrylodan-labeled IFABP and ALBP with added oleic acid.

For all of the proteins except for acrylodan-labeled IFABP, the fluorescence quantum yields calculated assuming simple energy conservation were anomalously high, i. e., the apparent heat signals were lower than those predicted from independent fluorescence measurements.

40|$|AbstractValues {{of thermal}} {{expansion}} coefficients (b) were experimentally determined for three samples: a mineral diesel and two biodiesels constituted by either fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) or fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), from transesterification reactions using raw corn oil and ethyl or methyl alcohol. Values of b {{were found to}} be 8. 36 (± 0. 06) 10 − 4 °C− 1, 8. 43 (± 0. 09) × 10 − 4 °C− 1 and 8. 39 (± 0. 03) × 10 − 4 °C− 1, respectively, within 95 % of statistical confidence. The thermal expansion coefficients for biodiesels from corn are higher than that for the mineral diesel. The expansion coefficient is also a key parameter in modeling fuel injection system of internal combustion engines. Comparing the two sets of data, for fossil diesel and biodiesel provides essential information to support the design and optimization of more efficient engines. A higher value for the <b>cubic</b> <b>expansion</b> coefficient implies that less specific mass of fuel is injected at higher temperatures, which can cause a loss in engine power. This is a fundamental parameter, reinforcing further the interest to establish an algebraic model to estimate the specific mass for a biofuel as a function of temperature, which is thought to be significantly different from that more commonly used for the fossil diesel. Polynomial models for such a correction were determined in this work; resulting rates for diesel and for corn oil biodiesels, based on either fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) or fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), were respectively − 0. 7089 kgm− 3 T− 1, − 0. 7323 kgm− 3 T− 1 and − 0. 7313 kgm− 3 T− 1. From the linear correlation between these data and those from standard EN 14214, values for the sensitivity (slope term) are seemingly small, or roughly 0. 723, but are high enough to cause relatively large impacts, in financial terms, for cases involving considerably big volumes of biodiesel, in commercial transactions...|$|E

40|$|Partial molar heat {{capacities}} and volumes of aqueous solutions {{are required to}} calculate the temperature- and pressure-dependence of chemical equilibrium constants over {{the wide range of}} conditions encountered in industrial and geochemical processes. Values for the standard partial molar heat capacities Cᴼp,₂ and volumes Vᴼ₂ of aqueous electrolytes also provide much information {{about the nature of the}} ionic solvation because both functions are sensitive to the hydrated structure of ions in solution. This research addresses two major topics. The objective of the first part of the program is to explore the solvation of M³⁺(aq) ions by determining the apparent molar volumes and heat capacities of several trivalent lanthanide ions over a wide range of temperature and pressure, and interpreting the results by semi-empirical hydration models. The second objective is to examine the behaviour of partial molar volumes in the methanol-water system, as an example of a hydrogen bonded non-electrolyte, over a range of temperature and pressure that approaches the critical locus of the mixture. [...] Apparent molar heat capacities Cpφ and volumes Vφ were derived from specific heat {{capacities and}} densities measured in a Sodev Picker flow microcalorimeter and vibrating-tube densimeter at pressure 0. 1 MPa. For high-temperature volumetric measurements, a stainless-steel cell vibrating tube densimeter and a platinum cell vibrating-tube densimeter were constructed in the course of this research. These densimeters allowed measurement of the densities of solutions relative to the reference fluid, water, at temperatures up to 600 K and pressures up to 30. 0 MPa with an overall uncertainty less than 0. 2 kg·m³. [...] Data for Cpφ and Vφ for LaC 1 ₃(aq), La(C 1 O₄) ₃(aq), and Gd(C 1 O₄) ₃(aq) from 283. 2 K to 338. 2 K; Nd(C 1 O₄) ₃(aq), Eu(C 1 O₄) ₃(aq), Er(C 1 O₄) ₃(aq), and Yb(C 1 O₄) ₃(aq) from 283. 2 K to 328. 2 K; and HCF₃SO₃(aq) and NaCF₃SO₃(aq) from 283. 2 K to 328. 2 K, were analysed by means of the Pitzer equations to derive Cᴼp,₂, Vᴼ₂, and expressions for the excess properties. The revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) model has been used to represent the temperature dependence of these standard partial molar properties within the experimental uncertainty. Plots of Cᴼp,₂ and Vᴼ₂, at T = 298. 15 K against the ionic radius of the six lanthanide cations clearly display the discontinuous behaviour known as the "gadolinium break". It was found that the ionic-radius dependence of Vᴼ₂ is consistent with changes in the primary hydration number, while the effect of temperature on the behaviour of Cᴼp,₂ across the series suggests that secondary sphere hydration has a major effect on C° 2. [...] Densities of NaCF₃SO₃(aq) and Gd(CF₃SO₃) ₃(aq) were measured with the platinum-cell vibrating tube densimeter at temperatures from 323 K to 600 K and at pressures up to 20 MPa. Apparent molar volumes for NaCF₃SO₃(aq) and Gd(CF₃SO₃) ₃(aq) calculated from the measured densities were represented by the Pitzer ion-interaction treatment. The temperature and pressure dependence of Vᴼ₂ and the second viriai coefficients in the Pitzer equation were expressed by empirical expressions in which the compressibility of water was used as an independent variable. These treatments led to values of Vᴼ₂(NaCF₃SO₃, aq) from 283 K to 573 K and Vᴼ₂Gd(CF₃SO₃) ₃, aq) from 278 K to 473 K as functions of temperature and pressure, which are the first reported in the literature. The conventional values of Vᴼ₂(Gd³⁺, aq) calculated from these data and Vᴼ₂(Na⁺, aq) from the literature are in excellent agreement with extrapolations of low-temperature values of Vᴼ₂(Gd(C 1 O₄) ₃, aq) based on the HKF approach. It was found that the effect of pressure on Vᴼ₂ for Gd(CF₃SO₃) ₃(aq) was more pronounced than that for common 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 aqueous electrolytes at temperatures near 298 K, and that this behaviour could be explained by the larger primary hydration shell for trivalent lanthanide cations. [...] Densities of {xCH₃OH + (1 - x) H₂O} relative to water were measured in the vibrating tube densimeter at the temperatures T = (323, 373, 423, 473, 523, and 573 K) and at pressures of 7. 0 MPa and 13. 5 MPa. Excess molar volumes VᴱM for {xCH₃OH + (1 - x) H₂O} were calculated from the experimental densities for the mixtures, using accurate equations of state for water and methanol. The data were treated with an extended corresponding-states model based on the properties of pure water. An empirical function was used to fit small differences between the compression factors of {xCH₃OH + (1 - x) H₂O} and the compression factor of H₂O at the same reduced temperature and the same reduced pressure. The corresponding-states treatment reproduces the measured densities to within the experimental uncertainty of 0. 0004 g-cm⁻³ at all of the temperatures and pressures studied, except at T = 573 K and p = 13. 5 MPa. The densities, excess molar volumes, partial molar volumes, isothermal compressions, and <b>cubic</b> <b>expansion</b> coefficients from the model are consistent with the limited literature data available. The behaviour of VᴱM at T = 573. 6 K, and p = 13. 7 MPa indicates either a very narrow region of (vapour + liquid) phase separation, or near-critical behaviour at x = 0. 44 with the critical pressure pc ≤ 13. 5 MPa...|$|E

We have tabulated through order beta^{ 25 } the {{series for the}} nearest-neighbor correlation function, the susceptibility and the second correlation moment in two dimensions on the square lattice, and, in three dimensions, on the simple-cubic and the body-centered <b>cubic</b> lattices. The <b>expansion</b> of the second field derivative of the susceptibility is also tabulated through beta^{ 23 } for the same lattices.

In this paper we describe how previous studies have sought to model the hemodynamic response function with restricted parametric models, and examine some of the inadequacies imposed by the implicit restrictions. We investigate more flexible estimation of hemodynamic response using <b>cubic</b> spline basis <b>expansions,</b> both of the time course itself and of the hemodynamic response function. In the latter, a deconvolution estimate of hemodynamic response is estimated from the observed fMRI time series at each pixel location and the designed temporal input stimulus. The estimated hemodynamic responses include both monophasic and biphasic forms, comparable with the more limited model proposed in Friston et al. [1995 b].

Recently, much {{attention has been}} given to developing structural equation models that account for nonlinear relationships between the endogenous latent variables, the covariates, and the exogenous latent variables. [Guo et al.

In this paper we consider semiparametric structural equation models when cubic splines are used for the basis <b>expansion.</b> <b>Cubic</b> splines are known to induce correlations.

40|$|The thermophoresis of {{homopolymer}} chains {{dissolved in}} a pure non-electrolyte solvent or solvent mixture is theoretically examined. Thermophoresis {{is related to}} the temperature-dependent pressure gradient in the solvent layer surrounding the monomer units (mers). The gradient is produced by small changes in the solvent or solvent mixture density due to the mer-solvent interaction. The London-van der Waals interaction was considered as the main reason of the excess pressure around mers. The resulting expression for the thermophoretic mobility (TM) contains the Hamaker constant for mer-solvent interaction, as well as solvent thermodynamic parameters, including the <b>cubic</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> coefficients of the solvents and the temperature coefficient of the solvent partition factor (for the solvent mixture). This expression is used to calculate the interaction constants for polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) in several organic solvents and binary solvent mixtures using thermophoretic data obtained from thermal field-flow fractionation. The calculated constants are compared with values in the literature and found to follow the same order among the different solvents and to be of the same order of value although several times larger. Furthermore, the model explains weak polymer thermophoresis in water compared with less polar solvents, which correlates also with monomer size. The concentration dependence of polystyrene TM in solvent mixtures also provides a satisfactory explanation by the proposed theory using a concept of secondary diffusiophoresis due to secondary temperature-induced solvent concentration gradient. The method for the evaluation of the diffusiophoresis contribution is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Closed lipid vesicles act as osmometers {{increasing}} or decreasing their volume {{under the}} influence of osmotic gradients. The enthalpy changes accompanying membrane compression or expansion have not been measured yet, and first results obtained with high-sensitivity titration calorimetry are reported here. Phospholipid vesicles suspended in and in equilibrium with an electrolyte or nonelectrolyte with a defined initial concentration of c(i), were injected into a solution with a final concentration of c(f), and the heat changes were monitored with a titration microcalorimeter. Osmotic compression (delta c = c(f) â€“ c(i) 0) an endothermic heat change with deltaH approximately 1000 +/- 200 cal/mol; both results normalized to a concentration gradient of delta c = 1 M NaCl. The heats of compression and expansion varied linearly with the lipid content {{and the size of the}} osmotic gradient but were independent of the vesicle size. The <b>cubic</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> coefficient alpha(v) which equals (1 /V) (deltaV/deltaT) p could be derived and was found to be 1. 25 x 10 (- 3) and 2. 5 x 10 (- 3) K(- 1) for the compressed and expanded bilayer vesicles, respectively. The entropy changes associated with compression and expansion could be estimated. Compression of the membrane led to a negative entropy change and increased the hydrocarbon chain order. Expansion of the membrane was accompanied by a positive entropy change which can be explained, in part, by more disordered hydrocarbon chains. Vesicle expansion and compression thus appear to be asymmetric as far as the thermodynamic driving force is concerned...|$|R

40|$|The {{conditions}} of a secure loss of stability of a two-axle wheel vehicle with absolutely hard steering {{have been found}} before. The analytically derived {{conditions of}} a secure stability loss in case of torsional stiffness are dependent {{on the relationship between}} the slipping resistance coefficients, the transverse clutch coefficients on the axes, and the torsional stiffness of the controlled wheel module. In this case, the trail distance is taken into account in the wheel module control system, the mass of the module being neglected. The approach suggested in the paper does take into account the mass of the controlled wheel module. The slipping forces are presented accurate to a <b>cubic</b> term of <b>expansion</b> in slipping angles. The torsional stiffness intervals have been found that provide a secure loss of stability of a two-axle wheel vehicle model. The intervals have been obtained {{on the basis of a}} bifurcation analysis of actual bifurcations of the stationary states in the vicinity of the rectilinear motion of the model. Diagrams that illustrate the fulfillment of secure stability loss conditions and allow using the results obtained in designing a wheel module are presented in the paper. The technique used is alternative to the well-known M. Bautin’s approach to determination of secure-insecure conditions in case of a divergent loss of stability. ...|$|R
40|$|The average structure, thermal expansion, {{behavior}} on compression, high temperature stability, and moisture sensitivity of YbZrF₇, an anion-excess ReO₃-type material, was explored. Cubic YbZrF₇ (a = 4. 10 Å) was synthesized by a fast quench from 1000 °C. Powder x-ray diffraction and density measurements showed reasonable agreement with prior work by Poulain, et. al. Elemental analysis confirmed stoichiometry. Attempts to synthesize monoclinic YbZrF₇ by a slow-cool from 675 °C {{resulted in a}} mixed-phase product, suggesting an incomplete reaction. Variable temperature powder x-ray diffraction performed at the Advanced Photon Source (17 -BM) identified anomalous volumetric <b>expansion</b> behavior in <b>cubic</b> YbZrF₇ including a dependence on thermal history. When the material is initially heated above 310 K, negative thermal expansion persists to approximately 350 K. This is probably associated with an irreversible change in local structure due to the migration of fluoride. Zero thermal expansion close to 300 K was consistently evident on cooling from 500 K, while negative thermal expansion was observed below room temperature. Cubic YbZrF₇ underwent an abrupt amorphization on compression to ~ 0. 9 GPa. This was preceded by a pressure-induced softening. The latter has been previously observed for similar ReO₃-type fluoride materials that display negative thermal <b>expansion.</b> <b>Cubic</b> YbZrF₇ begins to thermally decompose above 700 °C in dry nitrogen, where ZrF₄ is sublimated.

40|$|Providing {{global and}} {{high-resolution}} {{estimates of the}} Earth's gravity field and its temporal variations with unprecedented accuracy is the primary science objective of the GRACE mission. These twin satellites are the second spacecraft of the type gravity field dedicated missions which have realized satellite to satellite tracking in the low-low mode(SST-LL). The preceding spacecraft is the low orbiting CHAMP satellite which has substantiated the high-low mode satellite to satellite tracking concept(SST-HL). Observing inter-satellite range and range rate by the K-band Ranging System (KBR) with the highest possible accuracy is the superiority of GRACE over CHAMP. Nevertheless, LL-configuration can be combined with the HL-concept implemented in CHAMP to provide a much higher sensitivity. The line of sight (LOS) acceleration differences between the twin satellites and a Taylor expansion of the gravitational tensor components of the barycenter of the satellites, called gradiometry approach afterward, are two outcomes of the two concepts combination. Global gravity field determination in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients can be preformed using the LOS acceleration differences directly. However, full implementation of the other observable is neither possible nor required. On the other hand, being satisfied just with the applicable form of the observable corresponding to linear combination {{of the components of}} the tensor, causes linearization error. Unfortunately, contribution of this systematic error to the estimated coefficients is considerable. Therefore, the observable should be either modified or expanded at least up to third order to lower the effect of the neglected terms. Herein, the modified form of the observable will be employed due to complexity of <b>cubic</b> term <b>expansion</b> for full gravitational potential expansion. One possible modification is replacing the gravitational potential and all corresponding quantities with the incremental ones. Low-degree (up to 30) coefficients can be perfectly estimated by just using an incremental quantity corresponding to an ellipsoidal reference field. Due to simplicity of the cubic term of the expansion for an ellipsoidal reference field, a mixed linear-cubic approximation of the observable can be applied for low-degree harmonic coefficients estimation as well. Both of them yield the same numerical results. However, a reasonable accuracy can not be achieved in the higher degree (n> 30) coefficients estimation with the aforementioned modification. An incremental potential correspond with a spheroidal reference field of the degree l (l> 2) can be utilized instead. Redefinition of the reference field leads to an acceptable accuracy in the higher degree estimated coefficients. Another alternative is using a mixed equation in which mathematical models of the acceleration difference and the linear combination of the gravitational radient tensor elements types are considered for low-degree (n l) harmonics respectively. It's equivalent to removing the contribution of a spheroidal reference field of the degree l to the observations as a deterministic trend of the measurements. Implementation of these modifications results much the same accuracy as the other approach yields. For better understanding of the commission error behavior, the simulated observations are contaminated with a simulated Gaussian random noise sequence. Its contribution to the estimated coefficients with respect to other errors are analyzed. Besides, aliasing/omission error, the dominant degradation factor and its contribution to the estimated coefficients are studied. The numerical analysis indicates that overestimating the coefficients and weeding out the higher degree harmonics as the affected terms seems {{to be one of the}} possible strategies for minimizing the aliasing. The Gradiometry approach takes more CPU time as compared to the LOS acceleration differences. It is due to the second order derivatives of the potential calculation besides the first order derivatives which is common to both approaches. In contrast, the observable in gradiometry approach is a one-point function while the other observable is a two-point function. Therefore, in space-wise approach and local gravity field determination (i. e. local geoid), the gradiometry approach would be preferable to the other. In addition, the tensor elements indicate curvature of the gravitational potential which directly corresponds to geometry of the field...|$|R
