5|$|Wanting {{readers to}} know that the stone mask and its powers would be what would drive the plot, Araki started the manga with a prologue {{involving}} the mask, focusing on communicating the mood, rather than the standard way of opening a manga with an introduction of the protagonist. The concept of the Hamon power was created as he thought about how to create drawings that show the invisible; he {{came up with the idea}} of a character punching a frog, which was left unharmed, while the rock underneath <b>cracked</b> <b>open,</b> thus showing the supernatural power of the character's abilities. It was also influenced by his love for karate manga, with the supernatural moves used within them.|$|E
5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already <b>cracked</b> <b>open.</b> In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E

5|$|Implacable {{launched}} strikes {{every two}} and a quarter hours {{for the remainder of}} 14 June. These generally comprised five Avengers armed with bombs and four Fireflies with rockets and cannon. The final attack of the day was made by twelve Seafires which dive-bombed fuel tanks on Moen island. While several of the tanks were <b>cracked</b> <b>open,</b> it appeared that they were empty. This attack {{was the first time that}} Seafires had been used as fighter bombers in the Pacific. The British aircraft were fired on by Japanese anti-aircraft guns throughout the day, and reported finding few worthwhile targets. All of the strikes were escorted by Seafires, but no Japanese aircraft were encountered in the air. During the night of 14/15 June two Avengers operated over the atoll in an attempt to prevent the Japanese from repairing the airfield on Moen; these aircraft were fired on and tracked by searchlights but did not suffer any casualties.|$|E

25|$|Endospores {{can stay}} dormant {{for a very}} long time. For instance, endospores were found in the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs. When placed in {{appropriate}} medium, under appropriate conditions, they were able to be reactivated. In 1995, Raul Cano of California Polytechnic State University found bacterial spores in the gut of a fossilized bee trapped in amber from a tree in the Dominican Republic. The bee fossilized in amber was dated to being about 25 million years old. The spores germinated when the amber was <b>cracked</b> <b>open</b> and the material from the gut of the bee was extracted and placed in nutrient medium. After the spores were analyzed by microscopy, it was determined that the cells were very similar to Bacillus sphericus which is found in bees in the Dominican Republic today.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a continuum inelasticity-damage-based model. The aim is to describe the behavior of plain and reinforced concrete under monotonic and cyclic loading. We consider that inelasticity is due to micro-crack openings, and that the material recovers its original elastic modulus when all micro-cracks are closed. We make the hypothesis that the displacement ﬁeld, due to micro-crack openings, remains consis- tent with a strain called Unitary <b>Crack</b> <b>Opening.</b> The damage is described by a simple scalar which is taken as a multiplier of the Unitary <b>Crack</b> <b>Opening</b> tensor. Hence, the crack closure effects are directly described, the material recovers its original elasticity when micro- cracks are closed. Damage variable multiplied by the Unitary <b>Crack</b> <b>Opening</b> tensor gives a good description of anisotropy. Nonlinearity occurs when both damage and Unitary <b>Crack</b> <b>Opening</b> strains exist. Firstly, the thermodynamic and mathematical basis of the model are explored. Elementary tests are ﬁrstly considered for validation. Furthermore, the single edge notched beam and a beam subjected to cyclic loading are tested...|$|R

500|$|The {{note was}} printed in neat, all-capital letters with a {{felt-tip}} pen. Its exact wording is unknown, because Cooper later reclaimed it, but Schaffner recalled that it indicated {{he had a}} bomb in his briefcase, and directed her to sit beside him. Schaffner did as requested, then quietly asked to see the bomb. Cooper <b>cracked</b> <b>open</b> his briefcase long {{enough for her to}} glimpse eight red cylinders ("four on top of four") attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery. After closing the briefcase, he dictated his demands: $200,000 in [...] "negotiable American currency"; four parachutes (two primary and two reserve); and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival. Schaffner conveyed Cooper's instructions to the pilots in the cockpit: when she returned, he was wearing dark sunglasses.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1842, two LDS missionaries, {{one of whom was}} Charles Wesley Wandell, were preaching in the area. Although {{forbidden}} by her Presbyterian preacher, James recorded that she [...] "had a desire to hear them. I went on a Sunday and was fully convinced that it was the true Gospel." [...] James was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints the following Sunday, and later acquainted many friends and family members with her new beliefs as well. A year later, James and eight other members of her family, including her mother, three brothers, two sisters, and a brother and sister-in-law- decided to move from their home in Wilton to Nauvoo, Illinois, in order to live among other members of their new faith. The group of nine began their journey with other Latter Day Saints under the direction of Wandell, but got separated from the group at Buffalo, New York when they couldn't afford to pay the train fare from New York to Ohio. James and her family traveled the remainder of their journey (approximately 800 miles) on foot. In her Life Sketch, recorded in 1893, James recalled that [...] "We walked until our shoes were worn out, and our feet became sore and <b>cracked</b> <b>open</b> and bled until you could see the whole print of our feet with blood on the ground." [...] When James and her family arrived in Nauvoo, they were welcomed by Joseph Smith himself. Over the next year, her mother and siblings would establish their own homes. James, however, lived with the Joseph Smith family in Nauvoo until Smith's assassination in 1846.|$|E
