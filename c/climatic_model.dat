40|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} thermal properties on temperature and the moisture profile in Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements, an Enhanced Integrated <b>Climatic</b> <b>Model</b> (EICM) analysis was performed for a typical PCC pavement section in Louisiana. The EICM analysis showed that {{the temperature in the}} middle layer of PCC pavement decreased as thermal conductivity increased, and the temperature remained constant for higher thermal conductivity values. Temperature was measured at several depths of a concrete block embedded in soil and was compared to the temperature profile predicted by the EICM. Measured temperatures inside the concrete block were higher than the temperatures predicted by the EICM. The measured temperatures reached a peak hour temperature gradient on the hottest time of day, but the EICM model did not predict the peak hour temperature gradient. MEPDG analysis was performed to estimate the effect of thermal properties on the distress of PCC pavements. From the analysis it was found that thermal cracking increased with the decrease of thermal conductivity.

40|$|International audiencePlio-Pleistocene diatomitic {{sequences}} in the Shamb paleo-lake (South Armenia, Lesser Caucasus) offer a {{rare opportunity}} to give new insights on the paleo-climate of Western Asia. We present an integrated palynological, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronologic and magnetostratigraphic study for the most complete section in the sedimentary deposits of the Shamb paleo-lake. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of two volcaniclastic layers provided ages of 1. 24 ± 0. 03 and 1. 16 ± 0. 02 Ma (2 . Magnetostratigraphic data show that the entire Shamb section is of reversed polarity which, combined with 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating, suggests that the entire section correlates with part of the Matuyama period (1. 785 - 1. 070 Ma). Pollen assemblages and macroremains diversity clearly show an alternation of glacial and interglacial phases. Age calibrations and accumulation rate extrapolation allow a direct correlation of climate changes with the global isotopic curve, and show that the Shamb section probably ranges from approximately 1. 300 to 1. 080 Ma (marine isotopic stages 40 to 31). The vegetation of the Lesser Caucasus developed in a mosaic pattern in a Pleistocene continental, mostly arid climate, comparable to the present-day climate. The observed vegetation changes record a dominant climate response to the obliquity orbital parameter, but the influence of precession could not be established from the Shamb data. Pollen and macroflora both indicate that glacial periods were cold and dry and that interglacials were warm with local humidity.

However, an unexplained decline in the strength of this relationship has been reported from 1970 to 2000, which has been termed the ‘divergence’ problem.

We developed multi-factorial <b>climatic</b> <b>models</b> of LWD historical variations in tree-ring series of Norway spruce in north-eastern France, where divergence has been observed. The relationships between these LWD variations and 38 climatic variables were analysed. Climatic variables were obtained from homogenised climatic series and included monthly maximum and minimum temperature, potential evapotranspiration and water balance. Two <b>climatic</b> <b>models</b> of LWD were built, using projection to latent structure (PLS) regression analysis: (i) a model including linear responses to climatic variables (M 1) and (ii) a model including linear and quadratic responses to climatic variables (M 2).
