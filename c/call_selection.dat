40|$|The {{increasing}} {{sophistication of}} pre-hospital care, with paramedics and {{many types of}} 'rapid response' units, {{requires the use of}} advanced systems of ambulance control. The introduction of <b>call</b> <b>selection</b> by a paramedic in the ambulance control room significantly improved the tasking of the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service. This paper illustrates the need for a system to grade 999 calls, so that the appropriate pre-hospital response can be directed to each patient...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a call center model with {{two classes of}} impatient customers, VIP and less important ones. After entering the queue, a customer will wait a random length of time for service to begin. If service has not begun by this time he will renege and considered to be lost. We focus on developing queue joining and <b>call</b> <b>selection</b> policies. The policies satisfying performance constraints related to {{the ratio of the}} loss probabilities, as well as the variance of waiting times in queue. We propose and compare several real-time scheduling policies in order to reach our objective. The policies are characterized by simplicity and ease of implementation...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{a model for}} sense assignment which relies on assigning senses to the contexts within which words appear, {{rather than to the}} words themselves. We argue that word senses as such are not directly encoded in the lexicon of the language. Rather, each word is associated with one or more stereotypical syntagmatic patterns, which we <b>call</b> <b>selection</b> contexts. Each selection context is associated with a meaning, which can be expressed in any of various formal or computational manifestations. We present a formalism for encoding contexts that help to determine the semantic contribution of a word in an utterance. Further, we develop a methodology through which such stereotypical contexts for words and phrases can be identified from very large corpora, and subsequently structured in a selection context dictionary, encoding both stereotypical syntactic and semantic information. We present some preliminary results...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a call center with {{two classes of}} impatient customers: premium and regular classes. Modeling our call center as a multiclass GI/GI/s + M queue, we focus on developing scheduling policies that satisfy a target ratio constraint on the abandonment probabilities of premium customers to regular ones. The problem is inspired by a real call center application in which we want to reach some predefined preference between customer classes for any workload condition. The motivation for this constraint comes from the difficulty of predicting in a quite satisfying way the workload. In such a case, the traditional routing problem formulation with differentiated service levels for different customer classes would be useless. For this new problem formulation, we propose two families of online scheduling policies: queue joining and <b>call</b> <b>selection</b> policies. The principle of our policies is that we adjust their routing rules by dynamically changing their parameters. We then evaluate the performance of these policies through a numerical study. The policies are characterized by simplicity and ease of implementation...|$|E
40|$|In applied {{game theory}} the {{modelling}} of each player’s intentions and motivations {{is a key}} aspect. In classical game theory these are encoded in the payoff functions. In previous work [2, 4] a novel way of modelling games was introduced where players and their goals are more naturally described by a special class of higher-order functions called quantifiers. We refer to these as higher-order games. Such games can be directly and naturally implemented in strongly typed functional programming languages such as Haskell [3]. In this paper we introduce a new solution concept for such higher-order games, which we <b>call</b> <b>selection</b> equilibrium. The original notion proposed in [4] is now called quantifier equilibrium. We show that for a special class of games these two notions coincide, but that in general, the notion of selection equilibrium {{seems to be the}} right notion to consider, as illustrated through variants of coordination games where agents are modelled via fixed-point operators. This paper is accompanied by a Haskell implementation of all the definitions and examples...|$|E

Darwin’s statements explicitly distinguishing between these two kinds of principles at work in nature occur prominently in the text of the Origin.
