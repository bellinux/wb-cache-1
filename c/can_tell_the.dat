25|$|As far as {{scholars}} <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> <b>the</b> {{author of}} the blood atonement doctrine was LDS Church president Brigham Young, who first taught the doctrine {{after the death of}} Joseph Smith. The doctrine first began to be heavily taught and promoted, however, during the Mormon Reformation (1856–1858), most insistently by Jedediah M. Grant of the First Presidency. Public talk of blood atonement diminished substantially {{by the end of the}} Mormon Reformation in 1858 when Young was replaced as territorial governor by Alfred Cumming. The subject of blood atonement remained largely dormant until the 1870s, when the issue was revived by the national media during the John D. Lee trials for his role in the Mountain Meadows massacre.|$|E
25|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} SSB is in ferromagnetic materials. Microscopically, the material consists of atoms with a non-vanishing spin, {{each of which}} acts like a tiny bar magnet, i.e., a magnetic dipole. The Hamiltonian of the material, describing the interaction of neighbouring dipoles, is invariant under rotations. At high temperature, there is no magnetization of a large sample of the material. Then one says that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian is realized by the system. However, at low temperature, there could be an overall magnetization. This magnetization has a preferred direction, since one <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> north magnetic pole of the sample from the south magnetic pole. In this case, there is spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian.|$|E

500|$|Allmusic's Clayton Bolger {{described}} Young Modern as {{an improvement}} by the band, praising [...] "catchy melodic hooks, inspired lyrical themes, and stunning string arrangements". He claimed {{the album was}} the pinnacle of the band's development. PopMatters' Nick Pearson saw the opposite, claiming that [...] "nce you reach the level of intellectual maturity where you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> difference between cryptic but poetic lyrics and nonsensical crap, you have outgrown Silverchair". Pearson called the album an attempt to secure a safer territory and assure sales, after the success of past works, calling it more boring than its predecessors. Other reviewers noted influences from cult British band XTC.|$|E
500|$|Nick Pearson of PopMatters, meanwhile, was {{critical}} of the album.

Pearson likened Johns to Kurt Cobain, saying they share a common inability; [...] "his inability to write lyrics".

The gemological and industrial uses of diamond have created a large demand for rough stones.

However, in recent years it has become possible to produce gem-quality synthetic diamonds of significant size.

500|$|For {{the second}} and third season a {{variation}} of this theme, titled simply [...] "Lassie Main & End Title", was used for the opening and ending theme. Raoul Kraushaar, the music director for the series, is the listed composer for the theme; however the changes he made to the original are so slight that only a trained ear <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> difference. The third theme used for the series is an orchestral rendition of the aria, [...] "Dio Possente" [...] (Even Bravest Hearts May Swell) from Charles Gounod's opera, Faust. The exact time this theme started being used is uncertain due to conflicting records; however it is agreed that it was the third series, and was used for at least part of season four for the change of ownership of Lassie.|$|E

500|$|The group's {{voices are}} {{presented}} individually on the record. Savan Kotecha {{noted that the}} Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of Take Me Home tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: [...] "The fans <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> difference, {{but we wanted to}} make sure that when it came on the radio, the average person knew that it must be One Direction, because it’s five guys." [...] Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta [...] "tend to start out with more breathing room, giving the guys a chance to show off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, and commitment, in songs such as [...] "Little Things," [...] "Last First Kiss," [...] "Back For You," [...] and [...] "They Don't Know About Us." [...] Other tracks, like [...] "Heart Attack," [...] "Rock Me," [...] "I Would," [...] and [...] "Over Again," [...] have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{nears the}} end with [...] "Where Do We Go from Here?", as the Scoobies stand dazed and disoriented, facing {{different}} directions. As they sing [...] "Understand we'll {{go hand in}} hand / But we'll walk alone in fear", they line up, hold hands, then fling each other's hands away in a piece of what Whedon calls [...] "literal choreography". Each of the eight characters in this line wears a color in the visible spectrum, a conscious decision by the costume designer. The couples in the group wear opposite colors (Giles in green and Buffy in red, Anya in blue and Xander in orange, Tara in yellow and Willow in purple), and Rhonda Wilcox interprets the color-coding and choreography to represent the [...] "tension between the individual and the group". The characters as a chorus sing [...] "The curtains close on a kiss, God knows / We <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> end is near", moments before Buffy runs out to kiss Spike and the show closes with actual curtains. As Spike and Buffy kiss, a swell of music accompanies them, similar to the ending of Gone with the Wind. Lyrics sung moments before, however, forecast the uncertainty of the relationship between Spike and Buffy, as well as their contrasting reasons for initiating any romance; Spike wants to feel love from Buffy, while she simply wants to feel.|$|E
500|$|James {{had several}} unique {{experiences}} while {{living with the}} Smith family in Nauvoo. She recorded that often, as she went about doing the washing and cleaning for the Smiths, either Emma (Joseph's wife) or Lucy (Joseph's mother) would stop her and talk with her. One day while James was in Joseph's mother's room, the woman told her to [...] "bring me that bundle from the bureau and sit down here." [...] According to Jane, she was shown the Urim and Thummim, the tools used by Joseph Smith to translate the Book of Mormon. Lucy then said to her, [...] "You will live long after I am dead and gone and you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> Latter-day Saints that you was permitted to handle the Urim and Thummim". Another time, Emma asked James if {{she would like to}} be adopted by and sealed to her and Joseph. Not understanding at the time, James said nothing. Emma encouraged her to think about it. Two weeks later, she asked James again, at which time she said [...] "no m'am". James would say later that she did not understand what that meant, or she would have taken the couple up on their offer. This early decision {{had a significant impact on}} James' later life as a member of the Latter Day Saint church.|$|E

Frank reveals that he hates Jenna when he always chooses to [...] "kill" [...] Jenna {{in a game of}} [...] "Marry, Boff, Kill". Frank believes that Jenna is [...] "phony", and Jenna tries many times to redeem herself with Frank, with reasons such as her participation in Vagina Day: [...] "a charity event founded by a group of celebrities who have for whatever reason never been asked to participate in The Vagina Monologues". Eventually, in her final confrontation with Frank, she farts, but Frank is happy, telling her that that is the first real thing she has done, and the two reconcile. Another game of [...] "Marry, Boff, Kill" [...] leads some of the writers into believing that Cerie (who has been having problems with her fiance Aris) has feelings for Kenneth when she chooses to [...] "boff" [...] him. The writers send the pair off to get candy for the night. Kenneth and Cerie take a walk around Rockefeller Center, and Cerie reveals that she is not attracted to Kenneth but tells him that he <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> others that the two made out.

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Many reviews criticized the episode's {{lack of a}} cohesive plot. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, {{and the result was}} some languid storytelling which gave me way too much time to think about missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> writers didn't know what else to do.... This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in." [...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts like a crazy person {{in an effort to get}} his attention." [...] Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub-plots were deemed not funny and [...] "boring." ...|$|E
