40|$|Tomato flowers (Solanum lycopersicum) {{were used}} as a model system to {{investigate}} flower color modification by alteration of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, due to their ease of transformation and short time from seed to flowering. Tomato flowers are naturally bright yellow, primarily due to the accumulation of violaxanthin. Violaxanthin is a precursor of <b>capsanthin-capsorubin</b> synthase (ccs), which catalyzes the conversion of antheraxanthin and violaxanthin, two yellow xanthophylls, into capsanthin and capsorubin, two red κ-xanthophylls, respectively. A <b>capsanthin-capsorubin</b> synthase gene cloned from tiger lily (Lilium lancifolium) was expressed in tomatoes {{under the control of}} the promoter from a petunia chalcone synthase gene, fused to an enhancer sequence of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter. All transgenic lines produced flowers with a light orange pigmentation, as opposed to the natural yellow coloration. UHPLC analysis confirmed that the color change coincided with the accumulation of two novel carotenoids, capsanthin and a capsanthin-like carotenoid. A more pronounced color change likely could have been achieved using a stronger promoter or by down-regulating competing pathways. Nevertheless, these results indicate that alteration of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway with a gene for <b>capsanthin-capsorubin</b> synthase is a possible strategy for producing novel red and orange hues in certain ornamental crops...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{structural}} {{genes from}} the Capsicum (pepper) carotenoid biosynthetic pathway have been localized on a (Capsicum annuum × Capsicum chinense) F 2 genetic map anchored in Lycopersicon (tomato). The positions of these genes {{were compared with}} positions of the same genes in tomato when known, and with loci from pepper, potato, and tomato that affect carotenoid levels in different tissues. C 2, one of three phenotypically defined loci determining pepper fruit color, cosegregated with phytoene synthase. The <b>capsanthin–capsorubin</b> synthase (Ccs) locus, shown previously to cosegregate with Y, another pepper fruit color locus, mapped to pepper chromosome 6. Other structural genes in pepper corresponded to loci affecting carotenoid production as follows: Ccs in pepper and the B locus for hyperaccumulation of β-carotene in tomato fruit mapped to homeologous regions; {{the position of the}} lycopene β-cyclase gene in pepper may correspond to the lutescent- 2 mutation in tomato; and the lycopene ɛ-cyclase locus in pepper corresponded to the lycopene ɛ-cyclase locus/Del mutation for hyperaccumulation of δ-carotene in tomato fruit. Additional associations were seen between the structural genes and previously mapped loci controlling quantitative variation in pepper and tomato fruit color. These results demonstrate that comparative analyses using candidate genes may be used to link specific metabolic phenotypes and loci that affect these phenotypes in related species...|$|E
40|$|Carotenoid {{pigments}} {{in plants}} fulfill indispensable functions in photosynthesis. Carotenoids that accumulate as secondary metabolites in chromoplasts provide distinct coloration to flowers and fruits. In this work we investigated the genetic mechanisms that regulate accumulation of carotenoids as secondary metabolites during ripening of tomato fruits. We analyzed two mutations that affect fruit pigmentation in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) : Beta (B), a single dominant gene that increases β-carotene in the fruit, and old-gold (og), a recessive mutation that abolishes β-carotene and increases lycopene. Using a map-based cloning approach we cloned the genes B and og. Molecular {{analysis revealed that}} B encodes a novel type of lycopene β-cyclase, an enzyme that converts lycopene to β-carotene. The amino acid sequence of B is similar to <b>capsanthin-capsorubin</b> synthase, an enzyme that produces red xanthophylls in fruits of pepper (Capsicum annum). Our results prove that β-carotene is synthesized de novo during tomato fruit development by the B lycopene cyclase. In wild-type tomatoes B is expressed at low levels during the breaker stage of ripening, whereas in the Beta mutant its transcription is dramatically increased. Null mutations in the gene B {{are responsible for the}} phenotype in og, indicating that og is an allele of B. These results confirm that developmentally regulated transcription is the major mechanism that governs lycopene accumulation in ripening fruits. The cloned B genes can be used in various genetic manipulations toward altering pigmentation and enhancing nutritional value of plant foods...|$|E

The formation of carotenoids from lycopene is catalyzed by the enzyme lycopene cyclase (LCY), which is structurally and functionally conserved in all organisms.

However, some other green alga retained only one class of LCY, such as Haematococcus pluvialis (beta), Dunaliella salina (beta), Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (epsilon), and Chlorella sp.

Furthermore, the similar LCY lost occurred in red alga (Cyanidioschyzon merolae) and Heterokontophyta (Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana), which possess only the LCYB. In addition, the protein sequence of LCYB is highly similar to <b>capsanthin-capsorubin</b> synthase (CCS), which is another carotenogenic enzyme of plants. As a result, it is proposed that the CCS evolved from a duplicated LCYB. The discovery of two classes of LCY families in some algae suggests that carotenoid biosynthesis is differentially regulated in response to development and environmental stress in these algae, like members of LCY families are differentially regulated during development or stress in some higher plants.

40|$|Mature pepper (Capsicum sp.) fruits come in {{a variety}} of colors, {{including}} red, orange, yellow, brown, and white. To better understand the genetic and regulatory relationships between the yellow fruit phenotype and the <b>capsanthin-capsorubin</b> synthase gene (Ccs), we examined 156 Capsicum varieties, most of which were collected from Northwest Chinese landraces. A new ccs variant was identified in the yellow fruit cultivar CK 7. Cluster analysis revealed that CK 7, which belongs to the C. annuum species, has low genetic similarity to other yellow C. annuum varieties. In the coding sequence of this ccs allele, we detected a premature stop codon derived from a C to G change, as well as a downstream frame-shift caused by a 1 -bp nucleotide deletion. In addition, the expression of the gene was detected in mature CK 7 fruit. Furthermore, the promoter sequences of Ccs from some pepper varieties were examined, and we detected a 176 -bp tandem repeat sequence in the promoter region. In all C. annuum varieties examined in this study, the repeat number was three, compared with four in two C. chinense accessions. The sequence similarity ranged from 84. 8 % to 97. 7 % among the four types of repeats, and some putative cis-elements were also found in every repeat. This suggests that the transcriptional regulation of Ccs expression is complex. Based on the analysis of the novel C. annuum mutation reported here, along with the studies of three mutation types in yellow C. annuum and C. chinense accessions, we suggest that the mechanism leading to the production of yello...|$|E
40|$|The later {{steps of}} {{carotenoid}} biosynthesis involve {{the formation of}} cyclic carotenoids. The reaction is catalyzed by lycopene β-cyclase (LCY-B), which converts lycopene into β-carotene, and by <b>capsanthin-capsorubin</b> synthase (CCS), which is mainly dedicated to the synthesis of κ-cyclic carotenoids (capsanthin and capsorubin) but also has LCY-B activity. Although the peptide sequences of plant LCY-Bs and CCS contain a putative dinucleotide-binding motif, {{it is believed that}} these two carotenoid cyclases proceed via protic activation and stabilization of resulting carbocation intermediates. Using pepper (Capsicum annuum) CCS as a prototypic carotenoid cyclase, we show that the monomeric protein contains one noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) that is essential for enzyme activity only in the presence of NADPH, which functions as the FAD reductant. The reaction proceeds without transfer of hydrogen from the dinucleotide cofactors to β-carotene or capsanthin. Using site-directed mutagenesis, amino acids potentially involved in the protic activation were identified. Substitutions of alanine, lysine, and arginine for glutamate- 295 in the conserved 293 -FLEET- 297 motif of pepper CCS or LCY-B abolish the formation of β-carotene and κ-cyclic carotenoids. We also found that mutations of the equivalent glutamate- 196 located in the 194 -LIEDT- 198 domain of structurally divergent bacterial LCY-B abolish the formation of β-carotene. The data herein reveal plant carotenoid cyclases to be novel enzymes that combine characteristics of non-metal-assisted terpene cyclases with those attributes typically found in flavoenzymes that catalyze reactions, with no net redox, such as type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase. Thus, FAD in its reduced form could be implicated in the stabilization of the carbocation intermediate...|$|E
40|$|Fruit of Capsicum annuum L. (capsicum or pepper) {{are one of}} {{the major}} sources of red food {{colourant}} and pungency for spice production. In the spice production industry, fruit are mechanically harvested at different ripeness stages and fruit colour needs to be synchronised before being processed. However, even though capsicum ripens normally on the plant it often fails to ripen fully and turn red once harvested at the green stage. Attempts to promote ripening of harvested fruits have had limited success and the reason for this has been unclear. This project, therefore, investigated ripening behaviour on and off the plant of capsicum fruit grown in Australia and examined effects of pre- and postharvest applications on ripening of green harvested fruit. To examine ripening behaviour on and off the plant, capsicum fruit from three different cultivars (a mild paprika type cv. “Papri Queen”, a cayenne chilli cv. “Caysan”, and a sweet type bell pepper cv. “Aries”) were either allowed to ripen naturally on the plant or harvested at three different maturity stages: light green, deep green and breaker. Harvested fruit were stored individually at room temperature and several ripening characteristics including internal ethylene (C 2 H 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration, extractable colour, 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase and oxidase activity, and total soluble solid content (TSSC) were studied during storage. There was very limited involvement of C 2 H 4 during ripening of capsicum and the change in ACC synthase and ACC oxidase (two enzymes in C 2 H 4 biosynthesis pathway) activity was not closely related to that of C 2 H 4. However, it appeared that colour development in cv. “Papri Queen” was closely associated with what C 2 H 4 production did occur while a climacteric-like peak of C 2 H 4 could be observed in all fruit from cv. “Caysan”. For all three cultivars, the level of internal CO 2 concentration, extractable colour and TSSC were greater in fruit ripened on the plant followed by fruit harvested at the breaker, deep green and light green stage, respectively. Fruit harvested at the light green stage failed to change colour properly and had very low levels of internal CO 2 concentration and TSSC while fruit harvested from the breaker stage onwards ripened normally and developed sufficient colour for spice processing. This may suggest a role of external carbon-supply during ripening. To study the effect of the external-carbon supply during ripening, the stem of fruit were cinctured when fruit reached the light green stage and fruit were left to ripen on the plant. Cincturing delayed colour development of fruit by approximately five days but cinctured fruit were still able to turn red and develop extractable colour higher than the acceptable level of 140 ASTA units. Cincturing did not significantly alter other ripening behaviour such as CO 2 concentration or TSSC. The lack of external carbon-supply is, therefore, unlikely {{to play a major role}} in the failure of green harvested fruit to ripen. To study the effect of application of plant growth regulators (both pre- and postharvest), an effective method of solution application utilising cincturing was firstly developed. Different plant growth regulator solutions including ethephon, naphthalene acetic acid, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, sucrose, and different combinations of these were applied to fruit at the light green stage to study preharvest effects on ripening parameters during storage. Only treatment with high concentrations of ethephon increased the extractable colour higher than the acceptable level of 140 ASTA units and induced the complete degradation of chlorophyll. To study effects of postharvest application, 10 µL of various plant growth regulators was dropped into the hole created on the stem of harvested fruit for ten consecutive days. Treatment with ethephon significantly increased extractable colour and degraded chlorophyll content of fruit. Pre- and postharvest ethephon treatment strongly up-regulated <b>Capsanthin-capsorubin</b> synthase (Ccs) gene expression in a manner similar to the up-regulation of Ccs observed in fruit ripened on the plant. This explains the effect of C 2 H 4 on colour development and also indicates the possible reason for the failure of green harvested fruit to ripen. However, the Ccs gene expression and chlorophyll degradation induced by ethephon was not visible until 14 days after harvest which indicated it may not be a direct effect and other signal transduction factors may be involved. When fruit are ripened on the plant, colour development may, therefore, be induced by ripening-related factors (other than C 2 H 4) which is possibly inhibited or inactivated when fruit are harvested at the green stage. C 2 H 4 application to fruit at this stage may help to reactivate or recover these factors which in turn induce colour development. Thus, although capsicum fruit show typical non-climacteric behaviour, C 2 H 4 appears to be involved in some aspects of the ripening process. Thesis(Ph. D.)
