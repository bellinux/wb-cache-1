25|$|Archaeological {{examination}} of graves of the Early Iron Age (c. 400 BCc. AD 500) has revealed three distinct social strata. Ordinary farmers were cremated and buried in simple, flat graves. (Whilst {{this sort of}} burial had existed in the Bronze Age, too, the cremation part was a recently imported <b>custom</b> <b>from</b> Continental Europeand not imposed on ordinary farmers in particular.) Grand farmers and aristocrats were buried together with grave goods, while chieftains were buried in mounds. Grave goods of this age are dominated by iron artefacts.|$|E
25|$|During the {{sessions}} for A Little Ain't Enough, Becker used various Carvin, Ibanez, ESP and Valley Arts guitars, {{as well as}} a Les Paul on some tracks and a Gibson acoustic for select things. Becker has also been pictured with a few Hamer superstrats as well. From 1989–1991, Becker used various guitars, most notably a Peavey custom model with the numbered fretboard markers. Also used were an Ibanez Custom Shop guitar (probably based on an RG), a <b>custom</b> <b>from</b> Performance Guitars, a couple of various unknown Strat style guitars and a black Hurricane with 3 single coil pickups.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of Country Park halt, Kidderminster is, by far, {{the youngest of the}} SVR stations. Bridgnorth to Bewdley passenger services started in 1974, and it was decided to extend the line to Kidderminster to attract more <b>custom</b> <b>from</b> what was (and still is) a bustling town close to the West Midlands conurbation. After Kidderminster goods yard became disused in 1982, the SVR purchased the line to the east of Foley Park. Sharing the British Rail station of Kidderminster was impractical, so SVR claimed a site {{to the west of the}} BR station. Initially, the site was leased from BR until privatisation when BR looked to sell off the site, leading to the 1994 SVR share issue to raise capital to buy it outright.|$|E

2500|$|The King's College campus covers {{an area of}} some 35 {{hectares}} {{around the}} ancient King's College buildings and the High Street. It hosts around two-thirds of the university's built estate and most student facilities, and lies 2 miles north of Aberdeen city centre. The university does not own all the buildings on the [...] "campus" [...] which also include private houses, shops and businesses (although many of these rely heavily on <b>custom</b> <b>from</b> the university community) and it is best {{thought of as a}} district of the city dominated by the university. It can be reached from the city centre by bus routes 1, 2, 13, 19 and 20 operated by First Aberdeen and from northern Aberdeenshire or the bus station at Union Square by various routes operated by Stagecoach Bluebird.|$|E
2500|$|The Company {{initially}} {{referred to}} each territory it acquired by its respective name—Mashonaland, Matabeleland and so on—but {{there was no}} official term for them collectively. Rhodes preferred the name [...] "Zambesia" [...] while Leander Starr Jameson proposed [...] "Charterland". Many of the first settlers instead called their new home [...] "Rhodesia", after Rhodes; this was common enough usage by 1891 {{for it to be}} used in newspapers. In 1892 it was used in the name of Salisbury's first newspaper, The Rhodesia Herald. The Company officially adopted the name Rhodesia in 1895, and three years later the UK government followed suit. [...] "It is not clear why the name should have been pronounced with the emphasis on the second rather than the first syllable," [...] the historian Robert Blake comments, [...] "but this appears to have been the <b>custom</b> <b>from</b> the beginning and it never changed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jewitt's {{father was}} a {{blacksmith}} and trained his eldest son for that trade, intending that John go {{into one of the}} learned professions. Accordingly, from the age of 12 he attended an academy at Donington that provided an [...] "education superior to that which is to be obtained in a common school" [...] (p.6). He learned Latin, higher mathematics, navigation and surveying. After two years, his father withdrew him from school in order to apprentice him to a surgeon at , in the neighbourhood of the great traveller and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. Jewitt pleaded with his father to be allowed to learn metalwork instead, and eventually he was allowed to do so. He quickly learned his trade. About a year later (c. 1798) the family moved to Hull, then one of the main ports and trading centres of Britain, where the Jewitt business picked up a lot of <b>custom</b> <b>from</b> the ships.|$|E

2500|$|There was {{a chapel}} in the far-removed hamlet of Kingswood which had existed {{long before the}} middle of the 15th century; for when the vicarage of Ewell was endowed in 1458, it is {{mentioned}} as of long standing. [...] Mention occurs towards the close of the reign of Edward I of England. [...] A church ruling stipulated that the vicar of Ewell should not be obliged to minister to the hamlet of Kingswood or to celebrate Mass in the chapel there; that when any of the Sacraments of the Church were to be administered to the people of that place, the rectors (Prior and convent of Newark) should provide a priest for the purpose; and in case of the death of any inhabitant of Kingswood and his removal to Ewell for burial, the vicar should meet the body at Provost's Cross, {{on the south side of}} Ewell, which had been the <b>custom</b> <b>from</b> ancient time. [...] The subsequent history of this chapel is obscure.|$|E

60|$|I cannot help {{mentioning}} {{one little}} ceremony, which, I believe, is peculiar to the Hall. After the cloth is removed at dinner, the old housekeeper sails {{into the room}} and stands behind the Squire's chair, when he fills her a glass of wine with his own hands, in which she drinks the health of the company in a truly respectful yet dignified manner, and then retires. The Squire received the <b>custom</b> <b>from</b> his father, and has always continued it.|$|E
60|$|It {{must not}} be supposed, however, {{that the power of}} these {{hereditary}} nobles was absolute. It was very far from being absolute. It was restricted and curtailed by the ancient customs and laws of the realm, which customs and laws the kings and nobles could not transgress without producing insurrections and rebellions. Their own right to the power which they wielded rested solely on ancient customs, and, of course, the restrictions on these rights, which had come down by <b>custom</b> <b>from</b> ancient times, were as valid as the rights themselves.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Baggett {{had since}} become very gracious with various of the neighbours.

But he, during the last fifteen years, had crept silently into {{the society of the}} place. At first no one had known anything about him; and the neighbourhood had been shy. But by degrees the parsons and then the squires had taken him by the hand, so that the social endowments of the place were more than Mr Whittlestaff even desired.|$|E

60|$|The sudden {{arrival and}} {{appearance}} of some new and unexpected guests through the mysterious portal on which Mr. Beckendorff by his three knocks had previously produced such a tranquillising effect, {{and which he}} had now himself opened, explained {{the character of the}} apartment, which, from its unceasing melody, had so much excited the curiosity of his guests. These new visitors were a crowd of piping bullfinches, Virginia nightingales, trained canaries, Java sparrows, and Indian lorys; which, freed from their cages of golden wire by their fond master, had fled, as was their <b>custom,</b> <b>from</b> his superb aviary to pay their respects and compliments at his daily levée.|$|E

But the Countess, comfortably ignorant of them, came down as usual about eleven o'clock to her separate breakfast, which stood ready for her at that hour in the parlour; the kettle singing on the hob that she might make her own tea. There was a little jug of cream, taken according to <b>custom</b> <b>from</b> last night's milk, and specially saved for the Countess's breakfast. Jet always awaited his mistress at her bedroom door, {{and it was her}} habit to carry him down stairs.|$|E
