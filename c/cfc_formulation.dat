40|$|Alternative non-chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) {{propellants}} {{have been}} developed and {{have been shown to}} be safe alternatives to CFC propellants. Salbutamol (albuterol) and beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) in metered dose inhalers (MDIs) have been most studied. Salbutamol sulfate non-CFC MDIs have remained as a suspension formulation, and there is good evidence that salbutamol sulfate non-CFC MDIs are equivalent to salbutamol sulfate CFC MDIs. BDP non-CFC MDIs have a new formulation which is a solution and has a significantly smaller particle size than BDP delivered from CFC MDIs. This has resulted in more of the metered dose from the non-CFC MDI reaching the lower respiratory tract, with a consequent reduction of the dose deposited in the throat. This change allows a smaller dose of the non-CFC BDP to be equivalent to the <b>CFC</b> <b>formulation.</b> However, efficacy studies will be needed with other medications that are delivered in non-CFC MDIs because this finding with BDP relates to the solution formulation and particle size. The non-CFC propellant hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) - 134 a functions better at a lower temperature than its CFC comparator...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThis was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, {{cross-over}} study comparing the systemic pharmacodynamic effects (heart rate and serum potassium) and pharmacokinetics of salmeterol {{delivered by the}} non-CFC hydrofluoralkane (HFA) propellant 134 a and the CFC propellant (propellant 11 / 12) metered dose inhalers (MDI) in healthy subjects. At the therapeutic dose (50 μg), salmeterol-mediated systemic pharmacodynamics were equivalent for the HFA and CFC MDIs. Higher doses of salmeterol (150 and 300 μg) produced dose-related beta-agonist pharmacodynamic effects irrespective of the propellant. However, these effects were lower with salmeterol HFA MDI than with the salmeterol CFC MDI at all dose levels. Overall, salmeterol Cmax and AUC(0 −t) values were lower for salmeterol HFA compared with salmeterol CFC MDI. At the highest dose (300 μg), where a full pharmacokinetic profile was obtained, exposure to salmeterol delivered by the HFA MDI compared with the salmeterol CFC MDI was 27 % and 30 % lower for Cmax and AUC(0 −t), respectively. Maximum plasma concentrations were generally seen in the first plasma samples taken 5 min {{after the start of}} dosing. Salmeterol HFA was well-tolerated. At supratherapeutic doses, adverse events were typical for high-dose salmeterol with fewer adverse events occurring with the HFA compared with the <b>CFC</b> <b>formulation.</b> These data indicate that the salmeterol HFA MDI would not be associated with a significantly different pharmacodynamic, safety and tolerability profile compared with the salmeterol CFC MDI...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Flunisolide {{hydrofluoroalkane}} (HFA) has efficacy {{equivalent to}} that of flunisolide chloro-fluorocarbon (CFC) at one third the dose of the <b>CFC</b> <b>formulation,</b> a reduction from 250 pg/puff for flunisolide CFC to 85 pg/puff for flunisolide HFA. Flunisolide HFA delivers a smaller particle size (1. 2 pim) in solution, resulting in improved lung deposition as compared with flunisolide CFC (3. 8 pm), which is delivered in suspension. An added built-in spacer has reduced oropharyngeal deposition that may result in fewer adverse events and {{make it easier to}} use. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the year-long safety of flunisolide HFA (daily dosage 340 pg) with that of CFC beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) (daily dosage 336 pg) and cromolyn sodium (daily dosage 6, 400 pg) in children 4 - 11 years old with mild-to-moderate asthma. The effects of these drugs on linear growth and growth velocity were also compared. The study was a 1 -year open-label, parallel-group trial. Changes in physical examinations (including growth), adverse events, vital signs, electrocardio-grams, cosyntropin stimulation tests, mouth and throat cultures for Candida albicans, and laboratory findings were analyzed. Patients 4 - 5 years old received flunisolide HFA only. In total, 235 children were evaluated (152 receiving flunisolide HFA, 39 BDP, and 44 cromolyn). The incidence of adverse events was comparable among treatment groups; most were mild or moderate and considered unre...|$|E
40|$|Perfluoroakylpolyether (PFPE) greases {{are used}} {{extensively}} in critical flight hardware {{in a space}} environment. In the past, these greases have been processed using chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) based solvents. In response to the recent ban of <b>CFC's,</b> new <b>formulations</b> of environmentally friendly PFPE greases that are not processed with CFC based solvents were developed. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the performance of a new environmentally friendly formulation PFPE grease to a previously proven space compatible formulation PFPE grease. A one year test using 20 small electrical motors (two bearings per motor) was conducted in a high vacuum environment(2. 0 x 10 (exp 4)) Torr at a temperature of 90 C. Twenty bearings were lubricated with a new environmentally friendly formulation, and twenty bearings were lubricated with an old formulation.

40|$|Salbutamol {{sulphate}} {{metered dose inhaler}} formulations {{were developed}} with chlorine free, non-CFC propellant Tetrafluoroethane. Suspension formulations were prepared with 4 mg of oleic acid as the surfactant and varying proportions of ethanol as the co-solvent. Developed formulations were subjected to various qualitative and quantitative tests to ensure proper stability of the final package. In-vitro drug deposition studies using Twin impinger and Anderson cascade impactor indicated a net respirable fraction of 34 - 36. 7 % for the optimized formulation.

40|$|The {{removal of}} {{chlorofluorocarbon}} (CFC) propellants from industrial and household products has been {{agreed to by}} over 165 countires of which more than 135 are developing countries. The timetable for this process is outlined in the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer document and in several subsequent amendments. Pressured metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) for medical use have been granted temporary exemptions until replacement formulations, providing the same medication via the same route, and with the same efficacy and safety profiles, are approved for human use. Hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs) are the alternative propellants for CFCs- 12 and - 114. Their potential for damage to the ozone layer is nonexistent, and while they are greenhouse gases, their global warming potential is a fraction (one-tenth) of that of <b>CFCs.</b> Replacement <b>formulations</b> for almost all inhalant respiratory medications have been or are being produced and tested; in Canada, it is anticipated that the transition to these HFA or CFC-free pMDIs will be complete by the year 2005. Initially, an HFA pMDI was to be equivalent to the CFC pMDI being replaced, in terms of aerosol properties and effective clinical dose. However, this will not necessarily be the situation, particularly for some corticosteroid products. Currently, only one CFC-free formulation is available in Canada – Airomir, a HFA salbutamol pMDI. This paper discusses the in vitro aerosol characteristics, in vivo deposition and clinical data for several HFA pMDIs for which there are data available in the literature. Alternative delivery systems to the pMDI, namely, dry powder inhalers and nebulizers, are briefly reviewed...|$|R
40|$|The {{phasing out}} of {{chlorofluorocarbons}} (CFCs) requires {{the development of}} an alternative non-ozone depleting propellant for use in pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs). The present study assessed the effects on tolerability and efficacy of a switch from the currently available formulation containing the CFC propellants 11 and 12 to an alternative non-CFC formulation using the propellant hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) 134 a in patients with mild to moderate asthma. After a 4 -week run-in period during which patients received salbutamol 200 μg four times daily from a CFC pMDI, 547 patients were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with salbutamol 200 μg four times daily administered from either an HFA 134 a pMDI (VentolinTM CFC-free; 277 patients) or CFC pMDI (VentolinTM, 270 patients). At the end of this period, all patients then received a further 4 weeks of treatment with the same dose of salbutamol via a CFC pMDI (run-out period). On the basis that high doses of β 2 -agonists are known to increase heart rate, change in heart rate was selected as the primary outcome variable. Small increases in heart rate were observed during the treatment period and these changes were comparable in both groups; the 90 % confidence interval for the treatment differences was within the predefined limits for clinical equivalence (± 10 beats min− 1). The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups and there were no reports of paradoxical bronchospasm. Furthermore, daily PEF measurements showed comparability in terms of lung function. Symptom scores and use of additional bronchodilator were also similar in both groups. These results demonstrate that salbutamol (800 μg day− 1), formulated with HFA 134 a is equivalent to the current <b>CFC</b> <b>formulation</b> in terms of tolerability and efficacy...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIn {{accordance}} with the Montreal Protocol 1987, initiatives to phase out and replace ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants with non-ozone-depleting propellants in metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) {{in the treatment of}} asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are underway. In view of this, two multi-centre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind studies were conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of salmeterol xinafoate delivered by an MDI using the hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) 134 a propellant with the licensed <b>CFC</b> <b>formulation</b> (Serevent™) in asthmatic populations of children (4 – 11 years) and adults (⩾ 12 years). Patients on a stable dose of inhaled corticosteroids with a scope for improvement based on mean morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) and symptoms were randomised to receive salmeterol HFA MDI 50 μg twice daily or salmeterol CFC MDI 50 μg twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was mean morning PEF and secondary variables included other lung function parameters, symptom scores, use of relief medication and safety assessments. The difference between the treatments in adjusted mean morning PEF (salmeterol HFA–salmeterol CFC) were 2. 5 and − 3. 2 L/min for per-protocol populations of children and adults, respectively. The lower limit of 95 % confidence intervals for both populations was within the pre-defined limit (− 15 L/min) set for non-inferiority. Similar results were observed in intent-to-treat (ITT) populations. In children, the two formulations resulted in a lack of any statistically significant difference in secondary efficacy parameters. A significant difference at endpoint in clinic forced expiratory volume in 1 s was reported in favour of the HFA formulation in the adult population, although the magnitude of this effect was not considered clinically significant. The incidences of adverse events (AEs) were similar for both formulations and populations, and no safety concerns were generated. Together these data demonstrate salmeterol HFA MDI to be as effective as salmeterol CFC MDI in adults and children...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the long-term safety of a fixed combination of fenoterol hydrobromide (50 mg) and ipratropium bromide (20 mg) delivered using a metered dose inhaler (MDI) formulated with a non-chlorinated propellant, hydrofluoroalkane 134 a (HFA-MDI), with delivery using the conventional chlorofluorocarbon propellant (CFC-MDI, Berodual 1 /Bronchodual 1). The study was designed according to Safety Assessment of Marketed Medicines (SAMM) guidelines, to reflect as far as possible the use of MDIs under normal prescribing conditions. Two thousand and twenty-seven patients with chronic airways obstruction (CAO) were enrolled from 99 centres in France, 95 centres in Germany and 24 centres in Italy. Following a 2 -week run-in period, patients were randomized on a 2 : 1 basis (1, 348 patients to HFA-MDI, 679 patients to CFC-MDI) to receive a flexible dose regimen of the combination (2 puffs, 2 ± 4 times a day, as prescribed by the investigator) during a 12 -week open label phase. The overall incidence of adverse events was comparable between both groups. In addition, the incidence of respiratory side effects was also similar, with CAO exacerbations or bronchitis the most frequently recorded events. The safety profile of the HFA formulation was comparable to those of the marketed CFC-MDIs used in Germany and France/ltaly. No clinically significant differences were detected between HFA 134 a or CFC driven inhalers on the switch from CFC- to HFA-MDI (2 weeks before randomisation versus 2 weeks after randomization). There was a trend for taste complaints to be reported more frequently by patients in the HFA-MDI group (0. 7 % before randomization versus 3. 4 % after randomization). This, however, was an expected finding as the HFA 134 a formulation does have a different taste to the <b>CFC</b> <b>formulation.</b> No difference between formulations was observed in the incidences of coughing or paradoxical bronchospasm. The incidence of falls in FEV 1 > 15 % within 15 min following inhalation at each of the clinic visits was 1. 2 % for both CFC- and HFA...|$|E

Formulated DPI and MDI were evaluated for various official and unofficial quality control tests. The influence of over doses on valve delivery, effect of overages on emitted dose and influence of alcohol on spray pattern from MDI were studied. The better fine particle fraction and emitted dose were obtained from the DPI formulated with 10 : 90 ratio of fine lactose: coarse lactose and with 20 % w/w overages. The studies on MDI revealed that the 15 % of overdoses are required for effective valve delivery and 20 % overages are required for 100 % drug delivery. 5 - 10 %v/v alcohol was found to be preferable to get optimum emitted dose and fine particle fraction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractChlorofluorocarbon (CFC) -containing inhalers {{for use in}} the {{treatment}} of asthma are to be phased out {{under the terms of the}} Montreal Protocol (1). In this multi-centre, randomized, double-blind study, the therapeutic equivalence of two formulations of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) containing CFC or non-CFC (HFA 134 a) propellant, both delivered via the EasibreatheTM(Norton Healthcare Ltd, London, U. K.) inhaler, was determined in 229 asthmatic children. Each child received 100 μg doses of BDP (containing either CFC or HFA propellant) twice daily for 12 weeks. Both <b>CFC</b> and HFA <b>formulations</b> produced statistically and clinically significant improvements in patient's lung function and symptom scores when administered via the EasibreatheTMinhaler. The improvements in mean morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) were 41 l min− 1 and 34 l min− 1 for the BDP-HFA and BDP-CFC products respectively (P< 0 · 001) and for mean evening PEF the improvements were 38 l min− 1 and 38 l min− 1, respectively (P< 0 · 001). Similar findings were demonstrated for the other efficacy parameters. The two formulations were statistically equivalent with respect to efficacy. For mean morning PEF the estimated treatment difference (BDP-CFC/BDP-HFA ratio) was 102 · 6 % (95 % Cl 99 · 1, 106 · 2). Similar equivalence was shown for the other efficacy parameters. Both products were well tolerated, with no difference in the adverse event profiles, effects on 24 h urinary cortisol or Candida colonisation. This study demonstrates that the new formulation of BDP with HFA- 134 a propellant is equivalent to and directly substitutable for BDP with the older CFC propellant in a dose for dose manner. This should enable a seamless transition from one product to the other when CFC containing products are eventually phased out. In addition this study has also shown that the EasibreatheTMinhaler is an effective delivery system for use with inhaled products for {{the treatment}} of asthma in children...|$|R

Ipratropium bromide/salbutamol sulphate CFC-pressurized metered-dose inhalers (IB/SAL-CFC pMDI) have been in widespread use for many years without any apparent ill consequences. This combination has now been reformulated using the hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant. This study sought to establish the clinical noninferiority of a new HFA-containing IB/SAL pMDI to the conventional IB/SAL-CFC pMDI in subjects with mild/moderate COPD. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study in two consecutive periods: a 14 -day run-in period followed by a 85 -day treatment period. Eligible mild-to-moderate stable COPD subjects aged 40 - 75  years were enrolled into the study and entered the run-in period during which subjects withdrew all the bronchodilators, except for salbutamol as rescue medication. Subjects were randomized to 85  days treatment with either IB/SAL-HFA or IB/SAL-CFC, 20  µg qid. Results: Of the 290 randomized patients, 249 completed the study. The primary efficacy variable was the change in forced expiratory volume in one second from predose to 60  minutes after dosing on day 85. At the end of the treatment period, the adjusted mean change in forced expiratory volume in one second at 60  minutes was 123  mL in the IB/SAL-HFA pMDI group and 115  mL in the IB/SAL-CFC pMDI group. Because the lower limit of the 95 % confidence interval for the between-group difference (- 62  mL) was well within the noninferiority margin (- 100  mL), the HFA formulation was deemed clinically noninferior to the <b>CFC</b> <b>formulation.</b> This finding was supported by secondary efficacy assessments. Both formulations of IB/SAL were well tolerated during the prolonged multiple dosing. Conclusion: It is concluded that IB/SAL-HFA pMDI provides effective bronchodilation of similar degree to that achieved with IB/SAL-CFC pMDI. Therefore, IB/SAL-HFA pMDI is a valuable alternative to IB/SAL-CFC pMDI. Keywords: ipratropium/salbutamol, pressurized metered-dose inhaler, noninferiority, FEV 1, hydrofluoroalkane, COP...|$|E
