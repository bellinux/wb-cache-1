25|$|The first Supreme Soviet {{elections}} {{took place}} in March 1989. There was still only one legal communist party, but the availability of multi-candidate choice encouraged the popular fronts and other groups to spread their own electoral message. The Communist Party in all three Baltic republics was divided along nationalist lines, and political leaders were increasingly responding to people rather than the party. The biggest demonstration was the Baltic Way in August 1989, where people protested on the fiftieth anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop treaty by a human <b>chain</b> <b>linking</b> hands across the three republics. Still, by 1990, there were not yet calls for political independence but demands for economic independence from Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Using US definitions, {{a person}} who owns street name {{securities}} and {{who is not a}} member of an exchange, holds the securities through a registration chain which involves one or more custodians. This is due to the perceived impracticality of registering traded securities in the name of each individual holder; instead, the custodian or custodians are registered as the holders and hold the securities in a fiduciary arrangement for the ultimate security holders. However, the ultimate security holders are still the legal owners of the securities. They are not merely beneficiaries of the custodian as a trustee. The custodian does not become at any point the owner of the securities, but is only a part of the registration <b>chain</b> <b>linking</b> the owners to the securities.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} methodology for assessing the structural integrity of mooring components for offshore applications. Finite element calculations were performed {{in order to determine the}} stress levels in studless and stud <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> as well as to evaluate the critical regions of the links. A study was also developed based on the concept of critical volume associated with the material volume susceptible to a certain critical crack size. The results showed that the studless <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> present a higher critical volume than that related to the stud <b>chain</b> <b>links,</b> fact that confirms the beneficial effect of the stud. According to the crack assessment procedure the critical crack length is smaller for the stud <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> However, the critical association between volume and crack size turns the studless <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> more susceptible to brittle fracture than the stud <b>chain</b> <b>links...</b>|$|R
40|$|In 2002, several mooring {{chains of}} Girassol Off-loading buoy which was {{installed}} offshore Angola ruptured just after 8 months of service. A new failure mechanism called out-of plane bending(OPB) fatigue in mooring <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> was identified {{in addition to}} tension induced fatigue {{after a series of}} experiments. Currently, there are no models in literature which can comprehensively explain OPB mechanism in mooring <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> Models to explain OPB mechanism are required to calculate OPB stresses in <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> for fatigue damage evaluation. These models need to be "simple" and "adequate" {{in the sense that it}} should idealize the complicated geometry of <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> while giving accurate predictions of OPB stresses when subjected to rotation and tension, at a fraction of time used by solid finite element models or full scale experiments. The research carried out in this master's project deals with development of such models to explain OPB mechanism in mooring <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> In this thesis, a new interlink stiffness model is developed to describe the nonlinear hysteritic relationship between OPB moment and interlink angle. The interlink stiffness model is then applied to a system of <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> using two different methods: a physics based approach and a semi-empirical approach. Each of these methods present a new approach to idealize a system of <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> Then, a case study is presented in which a methodology to calculate OPB stresses for one sea-state is described. This methodology follows a de-coupled approach in which results of coupled floater-mooring analysis are taken as an input for the simplified models of <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> To verify this methodology, a comparative study is performed at the end in which coupled floatermooring analysis is carried out with and without including the interlink stiffness of <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic EngineeringOffshore and Dredging Engineerin...|$|R
500|$|In 1481, Henry VII {{entered into}} fresh {{discussions with the}} town about the defences. In 1462, the Crown had agreed to pay Dartmouth £30 a year to {{maintain}} a chain across the harbour for twenty years, and the town were probably keen to extend this profitable arrangement before it expired. Henry agreed to pay £150 over five years {{for the construction of}} a new artillery tower, with an annual subsidy of £30 towards the maintenance costs, later increased to £40 a year. The new tower was placed alongside the old fortalice, using stone from Cornworthy and Kingsbridge and a team of up to 12 stonemasons. The project dragged on until fears of a French invasion grew in 1486; two [...] "great murderer" [...] guns were installed and by 1492 there were four murderer and twelve serpentine guns installed there. The tower was finally completed in 1495, with a protective <b>chain</b> <b>linking</b> to the other side of the river supported by small boats called [...] "cobbellys", where it was protected by a tower at Godmerock. Another castle, Kingswear, was also built by Dartmouth, on the opposite side of the estuary.|$|E
2500|$|On July 26, 1976, Gacy {{employed}} an 18-year-old named David Cram. On August 21, Cram {{moved into}} his house. The following day, Gacy conned Cram into donning handcuffs while the youth was inebriated. Gacy swung Cram around while holding the <b>chain</b> <b>linking</b> the cuffs, then {{informed him that}} he intended to rape him. Cram, who had spent a year in the Army, kicked Gacy in the face, then freed himself from the handcuffs as Gacy lay prone. One month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door with the intention to rape him and said: [...] "Dave, you really don't know who I am. Maybe it would be good if you give me what I want." [...] Cram resisted Gacy's attempts to assault him and Gacy left his bedroom. After this incident, Cram moved out of Gacy's home and subsequently left PDM Contractors, although he did periodically work for Gacy over the following two years. Shortly after Cram had vacated Gacy's residence, another employee of PDM Contractors, 18-year-old Michael Rossi, moved into Gacy's house.|$|E

He felt an inexplicable thrill vibrate through him. No untrodden, ambushed wild, no perilous trail, no dark and bloody encounter had ever made him feel fear as had the kiss of this maiden. He had sternly silenced faint, unfamiliar, yet tender, voices whispering in his heart; and now his rigorous discipline was {{as if it were}} not, for at her touch he trembled. Still he did not move away. He knew she had succumbed to weariness, and was fast asleep. He could, gently, without awakening her, have laid her head upon the pillow of leaves; indeed, he thought of doing it, but made no effort. A woman's head softly lying against him was a thing novel, strange, wonderful. For all the power he had then, each tumbling lock of her hair {{might as well have been}} a <b>chain</b> <b>linking</b> him fast to the mountain.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{dynamics}} of continuously variable (CVT) chain drives. According to the discrete structure of the chain, which causes the polygonal actions, the mechanical model contains each <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> and pulley as a separate body.

For the calculation of the contact forces Coulomb's friction law as well as a time sparing continuous approximation are applied. Simulation results show the influence of the cone pulley's deformation on the power transmission. They also show the repercussion of the polygonal action. Furthermore the chain's pitch influence on the vibrational behavior of the transmission is discussed. A comparison of calculated and measured tensional forces ver [...] ...|$|R

Its superstructure leans on three crawlers of the same length, width and height. During the stacker's travel from the erection site to the open pit mine, three crawler <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> fractured, presenting {{an indication of the}} problems that were to occur during exploitation. In fact, after only 1000 working hours (about three months), 30 <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> sustained fractures resulting in direct and indirect costs due to the downtime that substantially diminished the effects of the overburden removal system. The goal of the study presented in the paper was to diagnose the cause of <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> breakdown occurrence. Working stresses in the <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> are defined by applying FEM. Experimental investigations define the chemical composition, the tensile properties, the impact toughness and the macro and microhardness. Metallographic examinations are conducted additionally.
