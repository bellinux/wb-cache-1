However, this approach may have undesirable consequences for <b>closed</b> <b>user</b> <b>groups</b> that use non-public HTTPS sites that use a certificate of one of the deleted CAs. These users will see a warning message when they access their secure sites, which weakens the effectiveness of such warnings [18].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} {{the notion of}} profile-based cooperation {{as a way to}} support awareness and informal communication between mobile users during chance encounters. We describe the design of Proem, a wearable system for profile-based cooperation that enables users to publish and exchange personal profile information during physical encounters. The Proem system is used to initiate contact between individuals by identifying mutual interests or common friends. In contrast to most previous research that concentrates on collaboration in well-defined and <b>closed</b> <b>user</b> <b>groups,</b> Proem supports informal communication between individuals who have never met before and who don’t know each other. We illustrate the benefits of profile-based cooperation by describing several usage scenarios for the Proem system. ...|$|R

5000|$|Contemporary {{criticism}} of the Indian military have drawn attention to several issues, such as lack of political reform, obsolete equipment, lack of adequate ammunition, and inadequate research and development due to over-reliance on foreign imports.

40|$|Background: In the Millennium Villages Project site of Bonsaaso, Ghana, the Health Team {{is using}} a mobile phone <b>closed</b> <b>user</b> <b>group</b> to place calls amongst one another at no cost. Methods: In order to {{determine}} the utilization and acceptability of the <b>closed</b> <b>user</b> <b>group</b> amongst users, social network analysis and qualitative methods were used. Key informants were identified and interviewed. The key informants also kept prospective call journals. Billing statements and de-identified call data from the <b>closed</b> <b>user</b> <b>group</b> were used to generate data for analyzing the social structure revealed by the network traffic. Results: The majority of communication within the <b>closed</b> <b>user</b> <b>group</b> was personal and not for professional purposes. The members of the CUG felt that the group improved their efficiency at work. Conclusions: The methods used present an interesting way to investigate the social structure surrounding communication via mobile phones. In addition, the benefits identified from the exploration of this <b>closed</b> <b>user</b> <b>group</b> make a case for supporting mobile phone closed user groups amongst professional groups...|$|E

We apply innovative implementation approach of utilizing high performance CUDA computing devices which allows us to consider population of up to 1 million consumers. We measure influence of a call graph structure, intra-family network choice coordination and agent rationality level on the market equilibrium. We discover that boundedly rational subscribers, who exploit simple decision heuristics to coordinate network choice within <b>closed</b> <b>user</b> <b>groups,</b> exert much stronger pressure on suppliers than fully rational ones. This leads to lower average calling costs, increased welfare and decreased monopolistic power of operators. We also observe asymmetry in operator margins and volume of on-net and off-net calls in accordance with empirical facts...|$|R
