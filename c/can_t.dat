40|$|The main {{question}} discussed in contemporary debates about personal identity is {{what to do}} with indeterminate cases – cases that is, where it appears indeterminate whether some person A at time t 1 is identical to a person B at time t 2. Some philosophers have argued that such cases are incurably indeterminate. I agree with these philosophers. However, they rarely, if ever, supplement their theories with an explicit explanation of why indeterminate cases keep popping up, and why they <b>can</b> <b>t</b> be solved (the focus has traditionally been on showing that they <b>can</b> <b>t</b> be solved). In this thesis, I try to answer the two whys. I do so by constructing a theory of personhood (or, at least, the framework for such a theory) in which persons are ontologically indeterminate. This makes it possible to claim that indeterminate cases simply mirror essential features of persons – which, in turn, explains why the cases <b>can</b> <b>t</b> be solved. In order to support the claim that persons are ontologically indeterminate I give a general theory of ontological indeterminacy. In that theory I show that ontological indeterminacy is a property mainly (possibly exclusively) instantiated by conceptual objects. I therefore argue that persons are conceptual objects (based partly on Searle s (1995) account of social phenomena). The result is a theoretical framework capable of handling and explaining many of the indeterminate cases that philosophers have traditionally struggled with. By the end of the thesis, I also show how the framework mashes well with empirical science, and how it turns some of the constitutive questions regarding persons into empirical questions about human psychology...|$|E

40|$|By using general {{estimation}} equations (GEE) on {{a sample}} of the biggest firms on Oslo Stock Exchange, the managerial power hypothesis is tested in a Norwegian context. The sample spans over 5 years and consist of 112 complete observations. One of the measures of managerial power is using social network theory where the extent of the CEO's social network is represented by measures of the degree of connections through board positions. These measures are called centrality measures. The focus of the thesis is to evaluate whether there is a significant positive relationship between centrality and executive compensation, and whether there is a significant relationship between managerial power and executive compensation. Only one of the centrality measures is found to be significantly, but the variable is negatively correlated with pay, and there is a concern that the variable capture a different effect than it was supposed to. Hence, there is not enough evidence to support that there is a positive relationship between connectedness and executive pay. Furthermore, some of proxies for managerial power were found to be significant, while others were not. Hence, the conclusion is that the influence of managerial power may be important and should be taken into account when explaining executive pay and designing compensation packages. However, the theory should be used as a supplement to existing models like agency theory, as the managerial power hypothesis <b>can</b> <b>t</b> fully explain all aspects of executive compensation. The thesis acts as a platform for further research on managerial power as well as social network analysis. The results in this thesis <b>can</b> <b>t</b> be generalized outside the Norwegian context due to limited sample...|$|E
