40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) {{offers a}} vast variety of options {{to improve the}} functionality and efficiency in the automated data collection (ADC) industry and Internet of Things (IoT). In the inventory process of RFID with passive data carriers, a population of battery less tags {{is located in the}} working range of an interrogator system. These tags contain transponders receiving operating energy from radio waves which can demodulate and modulate a digital signal from an RF carrier. The fundamental prerequisite in RFID is unique user identities (IDs) stored in the tag memories. Commonly, programming of these IDs occurs in the reactive near field, where the cavity of an RFID enabled bar <b>code</b> <b>printer</b> represents a typical example of such an environment. The two major challenges of user ID programming are the change of the electrical environment presented towards the transponder, as compared to the nominal far field or propagating near field conditions, and electromagnetic spatial selection, to prevent non-target tag programming. This thesis presents the results from an industrial Ph. D. project, in collaboration between industry and university. In a first part, novel measurement and characterization techniques of RFID transponders are presented, with the main goal of understanding the impact of non-linearity on communication quality under altered reactive near field conditions. The remaining part of the thesis addresses fundamental components needed in the concept of self adaptive reactive near field coupler technology, for geometry independent and spatially selective programming of RFID tags. The core of the technology is the differential transmission line loop (DTLL), exhibiting highly efficient and spatially selective coupling for varying inlay geometry; as such an array based spatial distribution of the reactive near field coupling is enabled. As exemplary simulations show, the versatility of the DTLL offers flexibility in array design, of creating a phase controlled reactive near field over the entire structure, which hence acts as a sensitive array. The elements act independently, where the amount of phase alteration in each element is a compensation for the geometrical size of the element itself. A fundamental property of the sensitive array is the independency of a software system, controlling the coupling elements. In other words, the reactive near field coupling of the array is self contained...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} a mechatronic system, designed and {{developed for the}} forest industry, to trace logs from forest to sawmill. The research is {{a key part of}} a large research project launched by the EU in 2006 called the Indisputable Key project. Wood waste during harvesting, transportation and refinement is a major concern for the wood industry worldwide. Some raw materials are not suited for specific end products, and acknowledging this late in the wood value chain is cost inefficient. Pinpointing specific raw material suitable for a particular end product could increase quality, reduce waste and environmental impact; to accomplish this, traceability is essential. To trace the raw material of a final wood product to its origin, marking and reading of the different specimens must occur at each refining stage in the wood value chain. The traceability chain can be divided into three main stages: forest to sawmill, inside the sawmill, and from sawmill to second manufacturer. The research presented here covers {{the first part of the}} wood value chain, namely, forest to sawmill. In Scandinavian countries, logs are cut to length in the forest using a harvester machine. To trace logs, a unique identity code needs to be associated with each log at harvesting time in the forest and detected before further processing at the sawmill. Earlier research using RFID transponders as code carriers have been functionally verified but too costly. Although the cost of RFID transponders is declining, alternative methods are considered a necessity. This constitutes the main driver behind this thesis. The thesis presents a promising alternative log marking method comprising a harvester saw-integrated log <b>code</b> <b>printer</b> and a sawmill code detection system. An identity code in the form of a standard matrix code is applied via the harvester saw bar during cutting. A prototype has been designed and realized and the results point towards a both time and cost efficient solution. The code detection system, to be placed in one or more locations at the sawmill, is based on vision technology and image processing to detect the applied log codes. Both log code marking and reading systems communicate with an ICT system which maintains the traceability database. A major advantage of the system is that both marking and reading is performed without any time-loss and hence do not disturb the high pace production flow in todays forestry. Also, the item cost of each code mark is very low, compared to e. g. a transponder. The marking technology is patent pending. A field test was performed in December 2009 in northern Sweden. A test batch of 320 logs was marked and read. Two code structures (i. e., matrix and barcode) were applied, where 210 barcoded logs were used to demonstrate log traceability between forest and sawmill. This result indicates that this technology has potential. The prototype is not intended for commercial use, but serves merely to demonstrate the potential of the method; further research is needed to improve its functionality. QC 2011051...|$|E

40|$|The electromagnetically {{isolated}} programming {{of unique}} user IDs, into the transponder memory of UHF RFID inlays, {{is essential for}} successful operation in the RFID inventory process. Bar <b>code</b> <b>printers</b> enabled for RFID represent a typical environment of such programming. They are usually equipped with an RFID interrogator and a reactive near field (RNF) coupler. Bar <b>code</b> <b>printers,</b> in particular those for industrial use, consist of compact robust metallic media housings. This environment fundamentally changes the electromagnetical properties of RFID inlays, nominally designed for operation in the far field. One fundamental requirement put on the coupler design is the strong mutual electromagnetic interaction towards RFID inlays with arbitrary antenna geometries, yet still completely isolated from neighboring inlays, being as close as a couple of millimeters apart. Another requirement is efficient coupling despite strong non-linearity of the transponder chip for increased drive power levels. This thesis treats the prerequisites for an adaptive solution of geometry independent RFID inlay programming in reactive near field. The work {{is divided into two}} distinct parts. The first part addresses the non-linear behavior of RFID transponder chips under source impedance and drive level shift. A measurement method with modulated stimuli is developed from which a figure of merit (FOM) is extracted, including the |ΔΓ|-value, a common performance parameter found in the RFID community. A dual probe connection method is introduced, enabling the characterization of RFID transponder chips from several vendors having different size parameters. An approximate ideal clipping model is developed, enabling power swept measurements with a linear vector network analyzer (VNA). In the second part the differential transmission line loop (DTLL) is presented as novel coupling element for high efficient programming of RFID inlays in reactive near field (RNF). Results for simple super elliptic loop geometries show strong magnetic coupling towards a number of different inlay geometries, utilizing the current inductive loop of the inlay. The inductive loop is common for virtually all inlay types, making the DTLL a strong candidate as coupling element in future adaptive coupling technologies. In particular the DTLL offers design flexibility both in component choice and geometry, suitable for further element optimization...|$|R

Jetdirect is based on HP's MIO (Modular Input/Output) interface, which was designed {{from the ground up}} with the IIIsi to create a mainstream full function high performance networked printer. The initial MIO interface card had Ethernet and Token Ring physical layer variants and used various networking protocols over an AUI/BNC connection. Initially, a printer needed a separate card for each protocol, such as TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, or DLC/LLC. The following year the team applied the technology to the legacy accessory slot on the LaserJetIIs and IIIs XIO (Extended Input/Output). MIO type Jetdirect cards were also used for network connectivity on some HP/Agilent laboratory equipment such as the 6890A and 6890 Plus series of gas chromatographs. These included unusual network connection types such as HPs I-Net which was used as an interconnect between various pieces of hardware that controlled the 58xx and 68xx series gas chromatographs. Not until 1994 would MIO interface cards be released that could support more than one protocol per card.|$|R
