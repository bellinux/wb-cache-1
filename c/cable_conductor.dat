50|$|In {{electrical}} cables {{different conditions}} govern, and installation regulations normally specify {{that the most}} severe condition along the run will govern each <b>cable</b> <b>conductor's</b> rating. <b>Cables</b> run in wet or oily locations may carry a lower temperature rating than in a dry installation. Derating is necessary for multiple cables in close proximity. When multiple cables are in close proximity, each contributes heat to the others and diminishes the amount of external cooling affecting the individual <b>cable</b> <b>conductors.</b> The overall ampacity of insulated <b>cable</b> <b>conductors</b> in a bundle of more than three cables must also be derated, whether in a raceway or cable. Usually the derating factor is tabulated in a nation's wiring regulations.|$|R

50|$|A {{traction}} current pylon is a railroad pylon carrying {{at least one}} circuit for {{traction current}}. In Germany, traction current lines with two systems (4 <b>conductor</b> <b>cables)</b> typically have a single level arrangement of the <b>conductor</b> <b>cables.</b> For traction current lines with four systems (8 <b>conductor</b> <b>cables),</b> the two-level arrangement (4 <b>conductor</b> <b>cables</b> on each crossbar) is frequently used, except for traction current lines supplying high-speed railway lines are used. For these lines a three-level arrangement is used, in which the lowest cross bar has four <b>conductor</b> <b>cables</b> {{and each of the}} two highest cross bars have two <b>conductor</b> <b>cables.</b> The three-level arrangement is also used for traction current pylons with 6 electric circuits (12 <b>conductor</b> <b>cables).</b> For the supply of rapid-transit railways operated with alternating current, some overhead line pylons have cross bars for traction current lines above the contact wire. Other pylons carry electric circuits for traction current and also for three-phase alternating current.|$|R
50|$|Installations are {{distinguished}} {{by a number}} of criteria, such as voltage (low, very low, high, etc.), phase (single or 3 phase), nature of electrical signal (power, data), type and design of <b>cable</b> (<b>conductors</b> and insulators used, cable design, solid/fixed or stranded/flexible, intended use, protective materials), circuit design (ring, radial), and so on.|$|R
50|$|This {{document}} and its precursors were created {{due to a}} need for a standard definition of <b>cable</b> <b>conductor</b> size. The main problem being that not all copper has the same resistivity value, so, for example, a 4mm2 conductor from two different suppliers may have different resistance values. Instead this document describes conductors by their nominal size, determined by resistance rather than physical dimensions. This is a key distinction as it makes a standardized definition of conductors based solely on their electrical characteristics.|$|E
50|$|In type NM <b>cable,</b> <b>conductor</b> {{insulation}} is color-coded for identification, typically one black, one white, and a bare grounding conductor. The National Electrical Code (NEC) specifies {{that the}} black conductor represent the hot conductor, with significant voltage to earth ground; the white conductor represent the identified or neutral conductor, near ground potential; and the bare/green conductor, the safety grounding conductor not normally used to carry circuit current. Wires may be re-colored, so these rules are commonly excepted. In 240-volt applications not requiring a neutral conductor, the white wire {{may be used as}} the second hot conductor, but must be recolored with tape or by some other method. Four-wire flexible equipment connection cords have red as the fourth color; unlike older European practices, color-coding in flexible cords is the same as for fixed wiring.|$|E
50|$|MIL-STD-1553B {{does not}} specify {{the length of}} the bus. However, the maximum length of bus is {{directly}} related to the gauge of the <b>cable</b> <b>conductor</b> and time delay of the transmitted signal. A smaller conductor attenuates the signal more than a larger conductor. Typical propagation delay for a 1553B cable is 1.6 nanoseconds per foot. Thus, the end-to-end 100 ft would have a 160 nanosecond propagation delay, which is equal to the average rise time of a 1553B signal. According to MIL-HDBK-1553A, when a signal's propagation delay time is more than 50% of the rise or fall time, it is necessary to consider transmission line effects. This delay time is proportional to the distance propagated. Also, consideration must be given to the actual distance between the transmitter and receiver, and the individual waveform characteristics of the transmitters and receivers.|$|E

This study considers a few examples to demonstrate the method of examining the induced voltage in single, double and triple-circuits. The calculated values for induced voltages were 0. 079 V/m, 0. 074 V/m and 0. 068 V/m for triple, double and single circuit. It is found that induced sheath voltage increased with the increase in number of the cables...|$|E

40|$|International audienceResults {{of making}} {{surfaces}} of flexible cable conductors, used for solar arrays in geostationary orbit, charge dissipative by a specially developed method of ion-beam surface treatment with simultaneous surface renewal are presented. All flexible <b>cable</b> <b>conductor</b> surfaces, {{including those with}} rough morphology and foreign inclusions, achieved surface resistivity of ∼ 10 – 20 [*][*]MΩ/sq. at room temperature and kept charge dissipation in a wide +/- 150 [*]°C space-related temperature range. A testing space qualification program confirmed all treated flexible cable conductors being resistant to thermal cycling and humidity, mechanically durable, and radiation resistant in geostationary orbit. All flexible cable conductors successfully survived 15 years space-equivalent geostationary orbit imitating testing. A comparison of beginning- and end-of-life characteristics of original and treated flexible cable conductors after this testing confirmed additional decrease of surface resistivity and almost equal final thermal-optical characteristics. Electrostatic discharge testing in a geostationary orbit charging testing facility demonstrated the long-lasting charge-dissipation properties of the treated flexible cable conductors, fully preventing them from building up critical charges in geostationary orbit environment, when a reliable grounding path is ensured for the surfaces...|$|E

40|$|The IRMIS toolkit {{has been}} used to create a {{relational}} model of the cabling system at the Advanced Photon Source. The component concept in the existing hardware relational model has been extended to include component ‘ports’, each containing a variable number of signal-carrying ‘pins’. In the relational schema each conductor (copper or fiber) in a multistrand cable bundle or ribbon is associated with the signal connection between two unique component pins. This close tie between conductor and signal is part of the IRMIS approach of integrating the accelerator software, hardware, and cable relational database coverage. The direct connection between each <b>cable</b> <b>conductor</b> and the component pin that it is attached to provides the user with end-to-end signal tracing capability. The signal concept has been generalized to include energy as well as information flow, such as the current flow between a power supply and a magnet.

This paper will discuss the integration of the cable database with the existing control system software and hardware component databases...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRequirements for a 6 km long high {{temperature}} superconducting (HTS) AC power cable of the Amsterdam project are: a cable has {{to fit in}} an annulus of 160 mm, with two cooling stations at the cable ends only. Existing solutions for HTS cables would lead to excessively high coolant pressure drop in the cable, potentially affecting public acceptance of the project. A way out would be to substantially reduce AC losses from 1 down to about 0. 1 W/m per phase at rated current of 3 kArms, frequency of 50 Hz and temperature of 77 K. In this {{paper we discuss a}} strategy towards this ambitious goal, a concept design of the single phase cable 3 kA conductor made of YBCO tapes and present corresponding experimental and simulation data supporting the developed approach leading directly to this goal. HTS cable model was made that show a drastically reduced AC loss. The low loss was achieved by using appropriate pitch angles for two-layer <b>cable</b> <b>conductor</b> of relatively large diameter, by minimizing the gaps between the HTS tapes, and by using narrow HTS tapes that conform well to the roundness of the underlying former. AC loss of 0. 12 W/m at 3 kArms was measured at a frequency of 60 Hz and at a temperature of 77 K...|$|E
40|$|Apparatus for {{multiplexing}} switch state signals comprises {{a plurality}} of switches and parallel weighted resistors connected in series between circuit ground and a node at a utilization device. The resistors are weighted {{as a function of}} a power of the same base, such as the power of the base 2, for coding the multiplexed switch state signals. A constant current source connected between the node and circuit ground drives current over a single <b>cable</b> <b>conductor</b> through the resistor. Each switch may be independently closed to change the switch state voltage signals multiplexed to the node. An analog-to-digital converter connected between the node and circuit ground demultiplexes the switch state signals received at the node and provides a switch state signal at each analog-to-digital output corresponding to the state of the switches at the moment. A potentiometer may replace a resistor and bypass switch combination in a position where the potentiometer has a maximum value of the lowest power of the base in order to multiplex a true analog voltage signal while switch state signals are unambiguously coded and multiplexed. The potentiometer in the least significant position permits the analog value to be in the range from 0 to a maximum corresponding to the least significant position of the switch state encoding. The invention may be used in redundancy systems by duplicating the invention with corresponding switches in each duplication ganged to open and close simultaneously upon operation of a pushbutton switch...|$|E
