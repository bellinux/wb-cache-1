40|$|AbstractAmong {{the many}} {{problems}} arising in cities, freight delivery {{is one of}} the most important ones. Increasing demands of the recipients (due to e-commerce development) leads to pressure and intensification of transporting freight through inner-city areas. This generates many unwanted results such as congestion, escalation of waste and environmental devastation, increased noise levels, greater than before, such as the risk of car accidents. An important alternative for traditional freight delivery are Urban <b>Consolidation</b> <b>Centres.</b> Utilizing UCC gives a chance to eliminate the harmful effects due to transporting freight by large-size vehicles through the city areas. This paper is focused on analysis of perspectives of urban <b>consolidation</b> <b>centres</b> development in Westpomeranian Region of Poland, concentrating on medium-size cities. For cities like Świnoujście and Kołobrzeg implementation of urban <b>consolidation</b> <b>centres</b> is important for efficiency of freight delivery especially during holiday periods...|$|R

30|$|Urban <b>consolidation</b> <b>centres</b> (UCC) are {{constructed}} and operated with view {{to improving the}} performance of urban freight deliveries. The main idea of this initiative is to bundle goods stemming from different shippers and share capacity of both infrastructure (storage area) and vehicles. In parallel, more conducive regulatory frameworks are developed to ease cooperation of involved stakeholders. Expected outcomes {{of this kind of}} initiatives are the reduction of costs and truck-kilometres as well as mitigation of CO 2 emissions and energy consumption [21].|$|R

30|$|Logistics aspects and hubs {{are taken}} into account via {{considering}} logistics transport chains. Thus, the number of stops and mode choice are determined for each of the corresponding shipments and chains. In addition, logistics hubs are defined and optimal shipment sizes are determined for each transport chain passing related hubs. There are different combinations and transport chains to connect suppliers and buyers. Apart from direct transportation, transport chains may pass intermodal terminals, distribution and <b>consolidation</b> <b>centres</b> with various combinations of these within the chain [34, 36].|$|R
30|$|Regarding {{the use of}} bicycle couriers, Schliwa [50] {{concludes that}} “Urban <b>Consolidation</b> <b>Centres</b> were {{identified}} to be the major complementary infrastructure to enable cycle logistics operators to keep {{the length of the}} journeys, and hence the delivery time, short”, and even refers to them as a “necessary precondition” to the success of a bicycle courier service. It is therefore clear that for a system which chooses to use a cycle courier for last mile transportation, the use of an UCC is crucial to whether the scheme is a success or failure.|$|R
30|$|Analogously {{to other}} models, EUNET {{contains}} a logistics module, {{which serves as}} a link between PC-matrices and OD-matrices [39]. Since logistics hubs (<b>consolidation</b> <b>centres,</b> national/regional distribution centres, major ports, local depots etc.) – here mostly defined as distribution logistics hubs or special generators – are included in the formation of OD-matrices, they play a crucial role. The distribution of commodity flows through logistics hubs is, comparable to other models, based on the properties of each hub (e.g., warehouse floor space data). Thus, logistics steps are explicitly considered by relating handling factors of products and characteristics of logistics hubs [22, 41].|$|R

The stated-choice experiments present two alternatives—one using a private vehicle subject to various traffic regulations and one using the urban freight <b>consolidation</b> <b>centre</b> with varying cost and efficiency levels. Conventional discrete choice data modelling shows that the potential demand is influenced mainly by the distance of the parking bay from the shop, by access permit cost, by the service cost of the urban freight <b>consolidation</b> <b>centre,</b> and by the delay in delivery time. Simulations are then performed to assess how the potential demand is affected by various incentives and regulations affecting urban goods distribution...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{areas are}} vital centers of {{economic}} activity and innovation generating large economies of density and proximity. Yet, procuring and distributing goods in an urban context is fraught with difficulties because of infrastructure congestion, external costs, conflicting objectives among stakeholders, and asymmetric information. In order to improve {{the performance of the}} urban goods transport system many policies have been proposed, including goods vehicle time windows, vehicle-type restrictions, loading policies, fiscal policies, the promotion urban transhipment and <b>consolidation</b> <b>centres.</b> Unfortunately, not much is known concerning how these policies affect the existing distribution practices. It is quite likely that the impact is differentiated by type of product and distribution channel. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore this issue. Drawing on the existing literature and on the empirical evidence from some Italian cities, the paper identifies and discusses the relationship between each of the above-mentioned policies and the distribution channels of some goods (fresh food sold in retail stores, food distributed by Hotels, Restaurants and Catering (Ho. Re. Ca.), pharmaceutical products and clothing&footwear) which are commonly distributed in Italian urban centers. It is found that the distribution of pharmaceutical products is unaffected by these policies, whereas the distribution of fresh food is negatively affected especially by access time regulation and loading policies. The Ho. Re. Ca. and the clothing&footwear channels are likely to be impacted the most by fiscal policies and by the promotion of urban transhipment and <b>consolidation</b> <b>centres...</b>|$|R

40|$|The South African inland {{logistic}} {{systems are}} heavily reliant on existing road networks. The bulk transportation of goods, such as coal, increases the loads the roads currently {{have to carry}} and lead to damaged roads that in turn increase logistic costs. For these and other socio-economic reasons the strategic {{decision has been made}} by one of the major coal transportation companies in South Africa to migrate the transportation of coal as far as possible from road to rail. To support this strategy, coal <b>consolidation</b> <b>centres</b> are to be optimally located, whereby road-based coal will be diverted to the hubs and transported by rail to the demand point. The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate mathematical models that could be used by decision makers to determine optimal locations of coal <b>consolidation</b> <b>centres.</b> To ful ll this aim two mathematical models are developed: a network-based model in which a limited number of prede ned nodes along the existing rail network can be chosen as hub locations, and the continuous model in which all points on the plane are considered. The two main objectives are to decrease total operational cost and to migrate the transportation as far as possible o road and onto rail. A test case is used to highlight strengths, weaknesses and underlying behaviours of the models. The most noteworthy endings involve the major weaknesses of both models. The greatest weakness experienced by the network-based model is the limitation of the possible hub locations; improved locations not on the rail network are excluded and could yield improved results. The continuous model eliminates this weakness, however, it does not consider the distance along the rail network in calculating optimal locations. This chosen locations the continuous model yields are numerically inferior to the network-based counterparts. For these reasons the decision is taken to use both models in order to achieve optimal results; the continuous model is used to determine additional hub locations, while the network-based model is used to determine nal results. In the procedure described above, mathematical models are developed with the capability to guide decision makers in determining optimal coal <b>consolidation</b> <b>centres.</b> The results with regard to the case study are analysed to give recommendations to guide the decision-making process.

40|$|Abstract—A {{number of}} {{cities around the}} world have adopted urban <b>consolidation</b> <b>centres</b> (UCCs) to address some {{challenges}} of their last-mile deliveries. At the UCC, goods are consolidated based on their destinations prior to their deliveries into the city centre. In many examples, the UCC owns a fleet of eco-friendly vehicles to carry out the deliveries. A carrier/shipper who buys the UCC’s service hence no longer needs to enter the city centre in which time-window and vehicle-type restrictions may apply. As a result, it becomes possible to retain the use of large trucks for the economies of scale outside the city centre. Furthermore, time which would otherwise be spent in the city centre can then be used to deliver more orders. With possibly tighter regulatio...|$|R

40|$|The chapter {{considers}} {{the role that}} urban <b>consolidation</b> <b>centres</b> (UCCs) can play in helping to reduce goods vehicle traffic and its environmental impacts in urban areas. A UCC is a logistics facility that is situated in relatively {{close proximity to the}} area that it serves. Goods destined for this area are dropped off at the UCC, and are sorted and consolidated onto goods vehicles for delivery to their final destinations, often using environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric and gas-powered goods vehicles, and electrically-assisted cycles. The development of UCCs since their first appearance in the 1970 s is reviewed and the various types of UCC categorised. The freight transport and logistics advantages offered by UCCs are discussed. Case studies of four recent UCC trials are included. The objectives, operational and financial aspects and impacts of these UCCs are compared and their critical success factors identified...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUrban <b>consolidation</b> <b>centres</b> (UCC's) are {{a popular}} measure in city logistics. They are usually {{introduced}} by local governments {{in order to}} reduce the number of motorized freight vehicles entering their cities. Practice has shown, however, that most of these UCC's are granted only a short lifespan because of their strong reliance on government subsidies. Still, striving to make the best possible use of truckload capacities is important when aiming to reduce the number of urban freight vehicles on the streets. Hence, a search for alternative consolidation strategies is necessary. The goal of this paper is threefold. First of all, it goes more deeply into the causes of the current lack of urban consolidation. Secondly, the existing literature and research on city logistics was explored for previous findings on urban consolidation. At last, a framework for classification of urban consolidation measures and initiatives was developed based on a survey of already adopted alternatives...|$|R
