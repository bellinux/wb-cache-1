5|$|Manju (Sripriya) {{was raised}} in a {{dysfunctional}} family that consisted of a timid father and a philandering mother; she hurtles from one disastrous affair to another, leading to her degenerating into a cynical woman. Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu (Rajinikanth), who owns the advertising agency she works for. He is a stereotype of the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In sharp <b>contrast</b> <b>is</b> Arun (Kamal Haasan), who has come to Chennai from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of an astatine compound with hydrogen– usually referred to as hydrogen astatide– was noted by the pioneers of astatine chemistry. As mentioned, there are grounds for instead referring to this compound as astatine hydride. It is easily oxidized; acidification by dilute nitric acid gives the At0 or At+ forms, and the subsequent addition of silver(I) may only partially, at best, precipitate astatine as silver(I) astatide (AgAt). Iodine, in <b>contrast,</b> <b>is</b> not oxidized, and precipitates readily as silver(I) iodide.|$|E

In the SAS/STAT R○ GLM, ANOVA, MIXED, and GENMOD procedures, the <b>contrasts</b> <b>are</b> used to answer specific additional questions. In many cases, it is difficult to define <b>contrasts</b> which <b>are</b> estimable, or correctly formed.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{separation}} of convolutive mixtures of independent source signals. Starting from a frequency point of view, we consider a joint diagonalization criterion. Integration of the latter over the frequency domain leads to <b>contrasts</b> which <b>are</b> valid for both iid and non iid sources. A generalization of these <b>contrasts</b> <b>is</b> proposed: it aims at obtaining contrasts with improved statistical performances. A link with existing time-domain <b>contrasts</b> <b>is</b> established. A simple gradient based method for the optimization of the <b>contrasts</b> <b>is</b> proposed and evaluated through simulation tests. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{perception}} of <b>contrast</b> <b>was</b> measured {{in patients with}} acute unilateral optic neuritis by a technique of subjective suprathreshold <b>contrast</b> matching, and <b>was</b> compared with <b>contrast</b> sensitivity as defined by threshold measurements. The suprathreshold apparent contrast and threshold <b>contrast</b> sensitivity <b>was</b> repeatedly assessed during the recovery phase. Generally, an attenuation of suprathreshold apparent <b>contrast</b> <b>was</b> found for high and intermediate spatial frequencies in the eye with optic neuritis. At a low spatial frequency, however, the suprathreshold <b>contrast</b> vision <b>was</b> spared. The threshold <b>contrast</b> sensitivity <b>was</b> not however, spared at low spatial frequencies. During recovery this frequency-specific loss in suprathreshold apparent contrast diminished and finally a "normal" suprathreshold <b>contrast</b> vision <b>was</b> observed in all affected eyes reaching a visual acuity of 1. 0 or better. In these cases also subjectively normal vision was reported in site of a persisting abnormality in threshold contrast sensitivity...|$|R

5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} community would expect to be used. According to contrast, infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and <b>contrast</b> <b>is</b> demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.|$|E
5|$|Gods {{were linked}} with {{specific}} {{regions of the}} universe. In Egyptian tradition, the world includes the earth, the sky, and the Duat. Surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation. The gods in general were said to dwell in the sky, although gods whose roles were linked with {{other parts of the}} universe were said to live in those places instead. Most events of mythology, set in a time before the gods' withdrawal from the human realm, take place in an earthly setting. The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky. The Duat, in <b>contrast,</b> <b>is</b> treated as a remote and inaccessible place, and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those {{in the world of the}} living. The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant. It too is inhabited by deities, some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world.|$|E

5|$|The film is an {{adaptation}} of Henry James's 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw. As one of his more popular stories {{it had already been}} adapted for films and television many times, although not previously by the BBC. The adaptation was screenwritten by Sandy Welch, who set the film in the early 1920s, in contrast to the novella's 1840s setting. This allowed the introduction of the Freudian psychiatrist interviewing the main character; this framing device is not used by James, but both the novella and the film share a first-person narrator. The updated setting also allowed the First World War to account for the lack of male staff at the house. The Freudian and libidinous elements some literary theorists have seen in James's story are particularly prevalent in the film, with Ann's repressed sexual feelings for the Master resulting in a number of highly sexual sequences. Further, Welch added a theological element not present in James's story; Ann's father is a preacher, although Ann herself is unsure of her faith. The psychiatrist, by <b>contrast,</b> <b>is</b> an atheist. When he asks Ann about her faith, she replies that she believes in the Devil.|$|E
5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe <b>contrast</b> <b>is</b> found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E

40|$|Four pigeons {{were exposed}} {{to a series of}} two-component {{multiple}} schedules of reinforcement that ordinarily yield positive and negative behavioral contrast. The stimuli that signalled the component schedules were sometimes located on the response key and sometimes off. Positive behavioral <b>contrast</b> <b>was</b> observed only when the stimuli were on the key. Negative <b>contrast</b> <b>was</b> observed independent of stimulus location. These data suggest that positive and negative <b>contrast</b> may <b>be</b> causally unrelated, and support an account of contrast in terms of the summation of key pecks that are separately controlled by response-reinforcer and stimulus-reinforcer dependencies...|$|R
40|$|Some {{phenomena}} of behavioral contrast in multiple schedules are reviewed, and three accounts of <b>contrast</b> <b>are</b> considered. Rate changes within a constant schedule component (transient <b>contrasts)</b> <b>are</b> distinguished from rate changes across successive schedule cycles (sustained <b>contrasts).</b> Pigeons <b>were</b> {{exposed to a}} three-component multiple schedule, in which a stimulus correlated with a constant variable interval schedule of reinforcement was preceded by a stimulus correlated with more frequent variable interval reinforcement, or by an extinction stimulus. If the preceding stimulus was correlated with more frequent reinforcement, the response rate in the constant component was low and increased with time. If the preceding stimulus was correlated with extinction, the rate in the constant component was high and decreased with time. Similar transient <b>contrasts</b> <b>were</b> observed in a two-component multiple schedule with different variable interval schedules in the two components. The transient contrast effects in the three-component schedule were shown to depend on differential reinforcement frequency rather than differential response rate in the preceding component. Such transient <b>contrasts</b> <b>were</b> not sufficient to account for sustained contrast effects observed in these experiments. The relation of these findings to the concepts of excitation and inhibition is discussed...|$|R
