40|$|This study {{examines}} changes <b>in</b> negative <b>campaigning</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands between 1981 and 2010. In addition, we examine which factors determine whether political parties {{are likely to}} make use of this <b>campaign</b> strategy <b>in</b> the Dutch multi-party system. We advance existing research on negative <b>campaigning</b> <b>in</b> two ways. First of all, this is the most extensive study of negative <b>campaigning</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands conducted so far and to our knowledge also the most extensive conducted in any multi-party system. Second, our study contributes to the theoretical understanding of the determinants of negative <b>campaigning</b> <b>in</b> a multi-party context by differentiating between parties' vote-seeking and office-seeking incentives, and stating the implications of office-seeking for the use of negative campaigning. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd...|$|R
