5|$|Numerous {{other birds}} can be seen, {{especially}} during the spring and autumn migration. Sand martins (Riparia riparia) arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in {{the second or third}} week of March. Flocks of tits (Paridae), swallows (Hirundinidae) and terns (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) and <b>common</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus canus), may be roosting. Good numbers of reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) and sedge warblers (A. schoenobaenus) nest in the fringing reeds, along with grebes (Podicipedidae) and Eurasian coots (Fulica atra).|$|E
5|$|Highly gregarious, western jackdaws are {{generally}} seen in flocks of varying sizes, though {{males and females}} pair-bond for life and pairs stay together within flocks. Flocks increase in size in autumn and birds congregate at dusk for communal roosting, with up to several thousand individuals gathering at one site. At Uppsala, Sweden, 40,000 birds have been recorded at a single winter roost with mated pairs often settling together for the night. Western jackdaws frequently congregate with hooded crows or rooks, the latter particularly when migrating or roosting. They have been recorded foraging with the common starling (Sturnus vulgaris), Northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), and <b>common</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus canus) in northwestern England. Flocks are targets of coordinated hunting by pairs of lanner falcons (Falco biarmicus), although larger groups are more able to elude the predators. Western jackdaws sometimes mob and drive off larger birds such as European magpies, common ravens, or Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus); one gives an alarm call which alerts its conspecifics to gather and attack as a group. Occasionally, a sick or injured western jackdaw is mobbed until it is killed.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is known}} for its {{diversity}} of birds, with 212 species having been recorded as of 1987. Of these, 68 commonly breed, 30 breed occasionally, and 14 which have bred previously. Common birds include the black-throated loon, the bean goose and various species of ducks. Egg-gathering was previously popular from the common goldeneye. Common predator birds include the rough-legged buzzard and merlin, while the white-tailed eagle and golden eagle are less common. The short-eared owl is the most common owl. Waders are abundant along the river, the most common being common ringed plover, ruff and spotted redshank. Other common birds are the <b>common</b> <b>gull,</b> Arctic tern and sparrows.|$|E

5000|$|A bird seen in December 2001 at Belhaven Bay, Lothian, {{and present}} each winter since (until at least 2005/6) is {{believed}} to be a hybrid between black-headed and <b>common</b> <b>gulls.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{realm of}} birds is {{particularly}} plentiful. Amrum counts {{among the most}} important hatching areas for seabirds in Germany. It is the only remaining hatching area for the Eurasian curlew in the Wadden Sea, and the main hatching region for the common eider, but also oystercatchers, shelducks, Arctic terns, seagulls like herring gulls, <b>common</b> <b>gull</b> and the lesser black-backed gull as well as many other species use to hatch there on the beach, in between the dunes or at the mud flats. Since the dunes of Amrum are a protected nature reserve, they are the only dunes along the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein where sea gulls and ducks are breeding. In other dune areas of the North Sea coast these birds are usually scared off by tourists. Additionally vast swarms of migratory birds will rest on Amrum during the season, e.g. red knot, brent goose or sanderling, all of whom are able to find sufficient food along the coasts of Amrum. Moreover, a number of songbirds can be found and pheasants which were equally introduced as game are common.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{birds are}} mallard and <b>common</b> <b>gull,</b> but other {{species such as}} common goldeneye, common tern, {{and a couple of}} black-throated diver are {{breeding}} by the lake and herons and ospreys are feeding in the area. [...] Trees by the lake shores also attract long-tailed tit and lesser spotted woodpecker, and occasionally whooper swan, and great crested grebe are reported by the lake.|$|E
2500|$|The {{park has}} a rich {{population}} of aquatic birds, {{attracted by the}} shallow, fish-rich waters. The proximity of big trees, especially pines, affords them good nesting opportunities. The most common species are the <b>common</b> <b>gull</b> , the common tern, the black-throated loon, and the mute swan [...] In the wetlands, one often finds the grey heron, the western capercaillie or even the common crane. One of the most notable aquatic species is the osprey, with thirty couples — {{probably one of the}} most important densities of the country. The white-tailed eagle, a species classified as endangered in the country, practically vanished from the park in the 1970s, but it is now returned.|$|E
5000|$|The park is home {{to number}} of British birds, mammals, amphibians, fish and invertebrates, along with {{occasional}} visiting reptiles. Some common species include mallards, black-headed <b>gulls,</b> water voles, <b>common</b> frogs and <b>common</b> <b>gulls.</b>|$|R
40|$|The diet of <b>Common</b> <b>Gulls</b> Larus canus was {{analysed}} from pellets and faeces {{during the}} breeding period in 1995. Three geographically well-separated colonies were selected: one located {{close to the}} open North Sea (Amrum Island), one at the inner edge of the Wadden Sea (Nordstrandischmoor Island, {{and one in the}} tidal river Elbe (Liihesand Island). The birds fed upon a large variety of food types. 1 n the two colonies adjacent to the sea, prey types from the tidal flats were most numerous (mainly crustaceans, polychaetes, bivalves). Gadids and Smelt Osmerus eperlanus were the fish identified most often, whereas discards from fisheries were relatively important during the early incubation period on Amrum and Nordstrandischmoor. Terrestrial food was also taken (earthworms, insects) but was less important. On Liihesand, in contrast, <b>Common</b> <b>Gulls</b> fed predominantly on terrestrial food (earthworms, insects, mammals and fruits). These birds hardly utilised the river Elbe and associated freshwater tidal flats. The diet changed in all three colonies over the breeding period. The proportion of mammals increased while that of fish and bivalves (only the two colonies close to the coast) decreased. On Liihesand, a considerable proportion of the pellets consisted of cherry stones during the chickrearing period. <b>Common</b> <b>Gulls</b> were relatively widely distributed in the inner German Bight but all major concentrations were located close to land, chiefly in front of the mouths of the rivers Elbe and Weser. <b>Common</b> <b>Gulls</b> (up to 150 individuals) regularly attended the inshore shrimping vessels...|$|R
50|$|The loch {{supports}} {{concentrations of}} wildfowl in autumn and winter in particular greylag geese, goldeneye ducks and pink-footed geese. <b>Common</b> <b>gulls</b> {{are also found}} on the loch. Reedbed and a birch and willow carr fringe the loch perimeter.|$|R
60|$|Even {{this small}} indulgence told {{against him in}} the minds of his companions. But indeed he was in a {{position}} so entirely false (and even ridiculous) that all his habit of command and arts of pleasing were here thrown away. In the eyes of all, except Secundra Dass, he figured as a <b>common</b> <b>gull</b> and designated victim; going unconsciously to death; yet he could not but suppose himself the contriver and the leader of the expedition; he could scarce help but so conduct himself and at the least hint of authority or condescension, his deceivers would be laughing in their sleeves. I was so used to see and to conceive him in a high, authoritative attitude, that when I had conceived his position on this journey, I was pained and could have blushed. How soon he may have entertained a first surmise, we cannot know; but it was long, and the party had advanced into the Wilderness beyond the reach of any help, ere he was fully awakened to the truth.|$|E
6000|$|Hawks are {{the most}} open, violent, and {{persistent}} enemies birds have; and it is really wonderful {{to see how well}} the persecuted kinds appear to know the power for mischief possessed by different raptorial species, and how exactly the amount of alarm exhibited is in proportion to the extent of the danger to be apprehended. Some raptors never attack birds, others only occasionally; still others prey only on the young and feeble; and, speaking of La Plata district, where I have observed hawks, from the milvago chimango--chiefly a carrion-eater--to the destructive peregrine falcon, there is a very great variety of predatory habits, and all degrees of courage to be found; yet all these raptors are treated differently by species liable to be preyed on, and have just as much respect paid them as their strength and daring entitles them to, and no more, So much discrimination must seem almost incredible to those who are not very familiar with the manners of wild birds; I do not think it could exist if the fear shown resulted from instinct or inherited habit. There would be no end to the blunders of such an instinct as that; and in regions where hawks are extremely abundant most of the birds would bo {{in a constant state of}} trepidation. On the pampas the appearance of the comparatively harmless chimango excites not the least alarm among small birds, yet at a distance it closely resembles a henharrier, and it also readily attacks young, sick, and wounded birds; all others know how little they have to fear from it. When it appears unexpectedly, sweeping over a hedge or grove with a rapid flight, it is sometimes mistaken for a more dangerous species; there is then a little flutter of alarm, some birds springing into the air, but in two or three seconds of time they discover their mistake, and settle down quietly again, taking no further notice of the despised carrion-eater. On the other hand, I have frequently mistaken a harrier (Circus cinereus, in the brown state of plumage) for a chimango, and have only discovered my mistake by seeing the commotion among the small birds. The harrier I have mentioned, also the C. macropterus, feed partly on small birds, which they flush from the ground and strike down with their claws. When the harrier appears moving along with a loitering flight near the surface, it is everywhere attended by a little whirlwind of alarm, small birds screaming or chirping excitedly and diving into the grass or bushes; but the alarm does not spread far, and subsides as soon as the hawk has passed on its way. Buzzards (Buteo and Urubitinga) are much more feared, and create a more widespread alarm, and they ars certainly more destructive to birds than harriers. Another curious instance is that of the sociable hawk (Rostrhanrus sociabilis). This bird spends the summer and breeds in marshes in La Plata, and birds pay no attention to it, for it feeds exclusively on water-snails (Ampullaria). But when it visits woods and plantations to roost, during migration, its appearance creates as much alarm as that of a true buzzard, which it closely resembles. Wood-birds, unaccustomed to see it, do not know its peculiar preying habits, and how little they need fear its presence. I may also mention that the birds of La Plata seem to fear the kite-like Elanus less than other hawks, and I believe that its singular resemblance to the <b>common</b> <b>gull</b> of the district in its size, snowy-white plumage and manner of flight, has a deceptive effect on most species, and makes them so little suspicious of it, ...|$|E
60|$|I {{spent hours}} of rare {{happiness}} at this spot in watching the birds. I {{could not have}} seen and heard them to such advantage if their breeding-place had been shared with other species. Here the herring-gulls had the rock to themselves, and looked their best in their foam-white and pearl-grey plumage and yellow legs and beaks. While I watched them they watched me; not gathered in groups, but singly or in pairs, scattered up and down all over {{the face of the}} precipice above me, perched on ledges and on jutting pieces of rock. Standing motionless thus, beautiful in form and colour, they looked like sculptured figures of gulls, set up on the projections against the rough dark wall of rock, just as sculptured figures of angels and saintly men and women are placed in niches on a cathedral front. At first they appeared quite indifferent to my presence, although in some instances near enough for their yellow irides to be visible. While unalarmed they were very silent, standing in that clear sunshine that gave their whiteness something of a crystalline appearance; or flying to and fro along the face of the cliff, purely for the delight of bathing in the warm lucent air. Gradually a change came over them. One by one those that were on the wing dropped on to some projection, until they had all settled down, and, letting my eyes range up and down over the huge wall of rock, it was plain to see that all the birds were watching me. They had made the discovery that I was a stranger. In my rough old travel-stained clothes and tweed hat I might have passed for a Branscombe villager, but I did no hoeing and digging in one of the cultivated patches; and when I deliberately sat down on a rock to watch them, they noticed it and became suspicious; and as time went on and I still remained immovable, with my eyes fixed on them, the suspicion and anxiety increased and turned to fear; and those that were sitting on their nests got up and came close {{to the edge of the}} rock, to gaze with the others and join in the loud chorus of alarm. It was a wonderful sound. Not like the tempest of noise that may be heard at the breeding-season at Lundy Island, and at many other stations where birds of several species mix their various voices--the yammeris and the yowlis, and skrykking, screeking, skrymming scowlis, and meickle moyes and shoutes, of old Dunbar's wonderful onomatopoetic lines. Here there was only one species, with a clear resonant cry, and as every bird uttered that one cry, and no other, a totally different effect was produced. The herring-gull and lesser black-backed gull resemble each other in language as they do in general appearance; both have very powerful and clear voices unlike the guttural black-headed and <b>common</b> <b>gull.</b> But the herring-gull has a shriller, more piercing voice, and resembles the black-backed species just as, in human voices, a boy's clear treble resembles a baritone. Both birds have a variety of notes; and both, when the nest is threatened with danger, utter one powerful importunate cry, which is repeated incessantly until the danger is over. And as the birds breed in communities, often very populous, and all clamour together, the effect of so many powerful and unisonant voices is very grand; but it differs in the two species, owing to the quality of their voices being different; the storm of sound produced by the black-backs is deep and solemn, while that of the herring-gulls has a ringing sharpness almost metallic.|$|E
