40|$|A key {{characteristic}} in any {{autonomous system}} is stability. Without stability robots could not work properly. To achieve stability first the robot needs {{the means to}} know its position with respect with its original so that a <b>correction</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> can be obtained if necessary. This {{is true for the}} type of INS (inertial navigation system) known as dead reckoning. In this INS the current position of the robot or system is calculated from measurements of the acceleration and knowledge of its original position. Some IMUs (inertial navigational units) consist of a couple of accelerometers and gyroscopes. With this IMU acceleration can be obtained. On Strap-down navigational system, this IMU are directly attached to the system so that their measurements correlates with those of the system, {{so that they can be}} used to calculate the position of the system. Throughout this document a method on how to obtain the necessary measurements from the IM...|$|E

(1972) {{in a study of}} the fragment containing residues 22 – 39. We have purified the remaining tryptic fragments, namely residues 1 – 8, 9 – 15, 16 – 21 and 17 – 21, by using ion-exchange chromatography on CM-cellulose and have carried out sequence determination by using the subtractive Edman degradation procedure and digestion with aminopeptidase M and carboxypeptidase B. These results have confirmed the proposed sequence for human adrenocorticotrophin in regions 6 – 7, 10 – 14 and 17 – 20, which had previously been arrived at only by analogy with the invariant sequence found in the three other mammalian adrenocorticotrophin species that had been investigated...|$|R
40|$|The flight subset {{control is}} {{required}} during the aviation equipment test flights. In {{order to achieve}} this objective the complex consisting of strap down inertial navigation system (SINS) and user equipment of satellite navigation systems (SNS) can be used. Such combination needs {{to be used for}} error <b>correction</b> <b>in</b> <b>positioning</b> which is accumulated in SINS with time. This article shows the research results of the inertial navigation system (INS) model. The results of the position- ing error calculation for various INS classes are given. Each of the examined INS has a different accumulated error for the same time lag. The methods of combining information of INS and SRNS are covered. The results obtained can be applied for upgrading the aircraft flight and navigation complexes.

40|$|We {{consider}} a portfolio allocation problem for trend following (TF) strategies on multiple correlated assets. Under simplifying assumptions of a Gaussian market and linear TF strategies, we derive analytical formulas for {{the mean and}} variance of the portfolio return. We construct then the optimal portfolio that maximizes risk-adjusted return by accounting for inter-asset correlations. The dynamic allocation problem for $n$ assets is shown to be equivalent to the classical static allocation problem for $n^ 2 $ virtual assets that include lead-lag <b>corrections</b> <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> of TF strategies. The respective roles of asset auto-correlations and inter-asset correlations are investigated in depth for the two-asset case and a sector model. In contrast {{to the principle of}} diversification suggesting to treat uncorrelated assets, we show that inter-asset correlations allow one to estimate apparent trends more reliably and to adjust the TF positions more efficiently. If properly accounted for, inter-asset correlations are not deteriorative but beneficial for portfolio management that can open new profit opportunities for trend followers...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} of a novel workpiece holder for micro- and meso-scale applications is discussed. Through the use of applied tensile axial force on fixed-fixed support beams, the stiffness and clamping force of the fixture can be actively tuned. Additionally, by applying varying stiffness values to two or more fixture elements working <b>in</b> tandem, the <b>position</b> of the workpiece can be manipulated. By tuning the stiffness, it was shown that the stable cutting region of end-milling operations can be effectively increased to allow for greater material removal. Other improvements in cutting operations can be achieved by using the part manipulation capability of the fixtures to make <b>corrections</b> <b>in</b> the <b>position</b> of the part during machining and by using the force tuning capability to reduce part deformation due to over-clamping...|$|R

40|$|Miscommunication {{in speech}} {{recognition}} systems is unavoidable, but a detailed characterization of user corrections will enable speech systems to identify when a correction {{is taking place}} and to more accurately recognize the content of <b>correction</b> utterances. <b>In</b> this paper we investigate the adaptations of users when they encounter recognition errors in interactions with a voice-in/voice-out spoken language system. In analyzing more than 300 pairs of original and repeat correction utterances, matched on speaker and lexical content, we found overall increases in both utterance and pause duration from original to correction. Here we focus on those adaptations- phonological and durational- that {{are most likely to}} adversely impact the accuracy of speech recognizers and serve to explain the observed decrease in recognition accuracy on spoken corrections. We identify serveral phonological shifts from conversational to clear speech style. In addition, we compare the observed durations of user utterances from the field trial to those predicted by a speech recognizer’s underlying model. We determine that while words <b>in</b> all <b>positions</b> may increase <b>in</b> duration <b>in</b> spoken <b>corrections,</b> those <b>in</b> final <b>position</b> are significantly more strongly affected than those <b>in</b> non-final <b>position.</b> Furthermore, we find that divergence from predicted duration was more marked <b>in</b> <b>corrections</b> of misrecognition errors than for those <b>in</b> <b>corrections</b> of rejection errors. These systematic changes argue for a general hierarchical model of pronunciation and duration, that extends beyond the word or sentence level to incorporate higher-level features from discourse or dialogue. 1...|$|R

40|$|Helical {{structures}} are more disordered and diffract more weakly than two-dimensional crystals, {{and images of}} them are inherently noisier. Automated techniques allowed us to correct, align and merge data from hundreds of images. To extend from ~ 1. 0 nm resolution to the near atomic level (~ 0. 4 nm), we needed to know whether our handling of images could be improved. For example, curved particles after correction {{may or may not}} produce data as good as particles that need no correction. We also wanted to evaluate the accuracy with which we predict the locations of layer lines hidden by noise and determine if all images contribute equally to higher resolution data. For this purpose, we developed an algorithm (the sniffer) which evaluates regions of Fourier transforms that contain signal buried in noise. We examined both the image handling procedures and the sniffer using images of bacterial flagellar filaments embedded in glucose and phosphotungstic acid. Although there was a correlation between phase residual and such factors as tilt, curvature and disorder, these defects explained only ~ 5 % of the variance. This suggested that helical particles following correction contribute almost as much as particles requiring no <b>correction.</b> <b>In</b> addition, <b>positions</b> of high resolution layer lines appeared accurately predicted from lower resolution layer lines. We also found that the signal-to-noise ratio in low resolution layer lines only weakly correlated with that of high resolution layer lines.

40|$|The 2 -point angular {{correlation}} function w(θ) (2 PACF), where θ is the angular separation between pairs of galaxies, provides the transversal Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal almost model-independently. In this paper we use 409, 337 luminous red {{galaxies in the}} redshift range z = [0. 440, 0. 555] obtained from the tenth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR 10) to estimate θ_BAO(z) from the 2 PACF at six redshift shells. Since noise and systematics can hide the BAO signature in the w - θ plane, we also discuss some criteria to localize the acoustic bump. We identify two sources of model-dependence in the analysis, namely, {{the value of the}} acoustic scale from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements and the <b>correction</b> <b>in</b> the θ_BAO(z) <b>position</b> due to projection effects.

40|$|International audienceCooperation between road users trough V 2 X {{communication}} {{is a way}} to improve GNSS localization accuracy. When vehicles localization systems involve standalone GNSS receivers, the resulting accuracy can be aected by satellite-specic errors of several meters. This paper studies how road-features like lane marking detected by on-board cameras can be exploited to reduce absolute position errors of cooperative vehicles sharing information in real-time in a network. The algorithms considered in this work are based on a error bounded set membership strategy. In every vehicle, a set membership algorithm computes the absolute position and an estimation of the satellite-specic errors by using raw GNSS pseudoranges, lane boundary measurements and a 2 D georeferenced road map which provides absolute geometric constraints. As lane-boundary measurements provide essentially cross-track <b>corrections</b> <b>in</b> the <b>position</b> estimation process, cooperation enables the vehicles to improve their own estimates thanks to the dierent orientation of the roads. Set-membership methods are very ecient to solve this problem since they don't involve any independence hypothesis of the errors and so, the same information can be used several times in the computation. Such class of algorithm provides a novel approach to improve position accuracy for connected vehicles guaranteeing the integrity of the computed solution which is pivoting for automated automotive systems requiring guaranteed safety-critical solutions. Results from simulations and real experiments show that sharing position corrections reduces signicantly satellite-specic GNSS errors eects in both cross-track and along-track components. Moreover, it is shown that lane-boundary measurements help reducing estimation errors for all the networked vehicles even those which are not equipped with an embedded perception system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-A neural map {{algorithm}} {{has been}} employed to con-trol a five-joint pneumatic robot a r m and gripper through feed-back from two video cameras. The pneumatically driven robot a rm (SoftArm) employed {{in this investigation}} shares essential mechanical characteristics with skeletal muscle systems. To control {{the position of the}} a rm, 200 neurons formed a network representing the three-dimensional workspace embedded in a four-dimensional system of coordinates from the two cameras, and learned a three-dimensional set of pressures corresponding to the end effector positions, as well as a set of 3 x 4 Jacobian matrices for interpolating between these positions. The gripper orientation was achieved through adaptation of a 1 X 4 Jaco-bian matrix for a fourth joint. Because of the properties of the rubber-tube actuators of the SoftArm, the position as a func-tion of supplied pressure is nonlinear, nonseparable, and ex-bibits hysteresis. Nevertheless, through the neural network learning algorithm the position could be controlled to a n ac-curacy of about one pixel (- 3 mm) after 200 learning steps and the orientation could be controlled to two pixels after 800 learn-ing steps. This was achieved through employment of a linear correction algorithm using the Jacobian matrices mentioned above. Applications of repeated <b>corrections</b> <b>in</b> each <b>positioning</b> and grasping step leads to a very robust control algorithm since the Jacobians learned by the network have to satisfy the weak requirement that the Jacobian yields a reduction of the distance between gripper and target. The neural network employed in the control of the SoftArm bears close analogies to a network which successfully models visual brain maps. It is concluded, therefore, from this fact and from the close analogy between the SoftArm and natural muscle systems that the successful so-lution of the control problem has implications for biological visuo-motor control.
