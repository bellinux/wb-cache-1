5|$|Early on, {{the economy}} {{depended}} greatly upon the railroads in the area. The city {{was the largest}} in Mississippi around {{the start of the}} 20th century, with five major rail lines and 44 trains <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> daily. The city's economy not only depended on the rails but the goods, such as timber and cotton, transported on them. With these rail-based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s, the city has adapted, moving from a largely rail-based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people.|$|E
5|$|The airport {{has three}} {{scheduled}} flights to the Vancouver International Airport every day, with one fewer on Sunday, provided by Air Canada Express. There {{is also a}} daily flight to the Calgary International Airport provided by WestJet Encore. The airport typically also has a few flights a week leaving Calgary at 8:45 PM and arriving in Penticton {{later on in the}} night, the plane then stays at the Penticton Airport and leaves for Calgary at 7:00 AM and arrives in Calgary around 9:00 AM. However, these flights were cancelled due to runway safety issues (See Airlines and destinations, below). Kelowna International Airport has affected traffic at the Penticton Regional Airport, with the former providing more direct flight and connection options for travellers. Penticton Regional Airport also recently underwent an expansion to add more seating area in the main terminal building as an addition to the extra WestJet Encore flights on certain days <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of Penticton.|$|E
25|$|French {{reinforcements}} {{continued to}} arrive through to 20 April, and {{the capture of}} an outer Spanish fort guarding the road through to the Puerto Real helped to facilitate the arrival of these forces. This captured fort also provided the French with a vantage point from which to shell ships <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the besieged Spanish port.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a lively}} place, a {{constant}} stream of people <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> going <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> the hum of many voices--the whole putting Richard in mind of some huge machine, grinding out its stipulated work.|$|R
50|$|If, in a {{place or}} thing, more energy is {{received}} than is lost, its temperature increases. If {{the amount of energy}} <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> going <b>out</b> are exactly the same, the temperature stays constant—there is thermal balance, or thermal equilibrium.|$|R
5000|$|... {{and even}} {{all this time}} was not wholly spent in {{conversation}} with him; for he was, during this time, <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> going <b>out</b> at Jerusalem, where he preached boldly {{in the name of}} Christ, and disputed against the Grecians.|$|R
25|$|Oyo {{became the}} {{southern}} emporium of the Trans-Saharan trade. Exchanges {{were made in}} salt, leather, horses, kola nuts, ivory, cloth and slaves. The Yoruba of metropolitan Oyo were also highly skilled in craft making and iron work. Aside from taxes on trade products <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the empire, Oyo also became wealthy off the taxes imposed on its tributaries. Taxes on the kingdom of Dahomey alone brought in an amount estimated at 638 thousand dollars a year.|$|E
25|$|Marsh {{was also}} {{drawn to the}} ports of New York. In the 1930s the harbors were {{extremely}} busy with people and commerce due to the country's necessity for economic recovery. The Great Depression brought about a decline in raw materials and therefore the demand for those materials grew dramatically, resulting in bustling harbors in big cities such as New York. Marsh would sketch the seaports, focusing on the tugboats <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the harbor, and capturing {{the details of the}} boats such as the masts, the bells, the sirens, and the deck chairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with the}} members singing the hook, {{alternating}} between headshots that introduce each member and the group singing on a stage. The video then continues on with each member interacting with their animated counterparts and the animations <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the green screens around them. Maruyama has super human strength, Yasuda can fly, Shibutani is an ace marksman, Yokoyama is a peeping tom with X-Ray vision, Nishikido is a skateboarder, Murakami {{has the ability to}} control weather, and Ohkura can control fire. Whenever they walk behind a green screen, their animated form is shown. Occasionally, their outfits flicker in color, alluding to the possibility that they're animated characters in the real world.|$|E
50|$|An Amsterdam hotel runs a {{millennium}} offer. People can stay overnight for only fl 19,99 (€ 9). It's a big success, {{and the hotel}} is quickly booked. The film follows the people living {{on one of the}} floors <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> going <b>out</b> <b>and</b> the things they encounter.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the lead}} single [...] "Bug" [...] Reyne said: [...] "I {{wanted to create}} a song out of playing the same four chords going round and round, {{building}} and growing all the time, with things <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> dropping <b>out.</b> The listener knows there's transition but there's no real point where the change is obvious." ...|$|R
50|$|It was {{the major}} route for trade <b>and</b> {{commerce}} <b>in</b> {{this part of the}} Luzon prior to the arrival of Spain. The Pampanga and Quingua Rivers served as arteries through which goods <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> going <b>out</b> of Calumpit passed. At present, the river is a valued resource as a rich fishing ground and providing farmers with irrigation.|$|R
500|$|There are {{numerous}} construction projects along the Papago Freeway spanning both east and westbound from around Dysart Road in Avondale, to Verrado Way in Buckeye. The projects {{are expected to}} convert the current 4 lane divided freeway into a 6 to 10 lane divided freeway. [...] The main project is complete. Along with the anticipation of the completion of State Route 801, traffic <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of Phoenix is anticipated to be less congested, and easier to manage.|$|E
500|$|Canvaswork, {{in which}} thread is {{stitched}} through a foundation fabric, and surface embroidery, {{in which the}} majority of the thread sits on top of the fabric, exist side-by-side in the English tradition, <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of fashion over the years. [...] In the 19th century, the craze for Berlin wool work, a canvaswork style using brightly coloured wool, contrasts with art needlework, associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement, which attempted to resurrect the artistic and expressive styles of medieval surface embroidery {{under the influence of the}} Gothic Revival and the Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E
500|$|On {{creating}} the character, Fazekas said the writers [...] "wanted {{to be really}} specific about who the woman is that Jarvis is just madly in love with" [...] in order to highlight the strong, platonic relationship Jarvis has with Carter. Fazekas added, [...] "It makes sense in that, Jarvis likes Peggy Carter, so of course the woman he's in love with {{would not be a}} quiet, prim and proper lady ... We also wanted to be very clear that Peggy and Ana really like each other, and that there's no jealousy from Ana. Ana and Jarvis are so comfortable in their relationship, they're not going to be jealous of other people <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of their lives." [...] On some of the differences between Ana and Edwin, Verbeek said, [...] "The first scene we had I walk in and I smack him on his ass, which is a sort of sexual, playful, fun thing they have. That's not something he would do, that's something she does, and he loves it." [...] D'Arcy later revealed that Verbeek had improvised this on their first day on set, after having [...] " [...] flown in", calling it [...] "brilliantly courageous ... to do it to an actor you don’t know" [...] and [...] "so perfectly what they were hoping that Ana would be like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said she, [...] "that their {{expenses}} <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> returning, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> remaining {{here with}} us, in the interim, {{would amount to}} a considerable sum." ...|$|R
50|$|During the 19th century, {{the port}} {{became one of}} the three most {{important}} ports on the Danube in Wallachia, the other two being Turnu and Giurgiu. The city's greatest period of prosperity {{was at the end of}} the 19th century <b>and</b> <b>in</b> the early 20th century, when it was an important port for most of the merchandise <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> going <b>out</b> of Romania.|$|R
5000|$|The {{review in}} Variety echoed similar concerns. [...] "(The) Picture is a fund of {{interesting}} atmosphere about the {{air mail service}}. Radio exchanges are <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> going <b>out</b> all the time, couched in technical language such as 'Visibility zero, ceiling zero. Caution to all planes.' It's interesting enough, but in essence the producer has dramatized the air mail service first <b>and</b> slipped <b>in</b> a human story as a second thought." ...|$|R
2500|$|With this {{string of}} fame, came {{a slew of}} journalists and notable photographers whom she allowed into her home {{to learn more about}} her. [...] Her beloved pet crow, Checcha was irritated by all the commotion with people <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out.</b> “If Checcha has had enough, so have I,” Deledda was quoted as saying.|$|E
2500|$|The Tang dynasty (618–907) was {{particularly}} {{noted for its}} poetry, especially the shi forms. [...] This poetry was both a pervasive social phenomenon throughout the Tang literate classes, who developed the ability to compose poems on demand {{as part of the}} Imperial examination system, but also a social grace necessary for polite conduct on social occasions, such as part of the interaction at banquets or social gatherings. Some 50,000 poems survive, mostly represented in the Ming Dynasty collection the Quantangshi. Their popularity in the historical Chinese cultural area has varied over time, with certain authors <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of favor and others permanently obscure. Some authors, such as Li Bai, Wang Wei, Du Fu, and Bai Juyi (also, known as [...] "Po Chü-i") managed to maintain consistent popularity.|$|E
2500|$|Juneau {{is rather}} unusual among U.S. capitals (except Honolulu, Hawaii) {{in that there}} are no roads {{connecting}} the city to the rest of Alaska or to the rest of North America (although ferry service is available for cars). The absence of a road network is due to the extremely rugged terrain surrounding the city. This in turn makes Juneau a de facto island city in terms of transportation, since all goods <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> must go by plane or boat, in spite of the city being located on the Alaskan mainland. Downtown Juneau sits at sea level, with tides averaging , below steep mountains about [...] to [...] high. Atop these mountains is the Juneau Icefield, a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow; two of these, the Mendenhall Glacier and the Lemon Creek Glacier, are visible from the local road system. The Mendenhall glacier has been gradually retreating; its front face is declining both in width and height.|$|E
60|$|Without {{attracting}} his attention, therefore, {{she watched}} every {{movement of his}} morning. She saw him sitting at his bureau with a creased and crumpled letter, and knew it was Bellew's; and she hovered about, <b>coming</b> softly <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out,</b> doing little things here <b>and</b> there <b>and</b> <b>in</b> the hall, outside. But the Squire gave no sign, motionless as the spaniel John couched along the ground with his nose between his paws.|$|R
60|$|But {{this was}} not the only distant {{expedition}} they had made, for they had once gone down the Stour as far as Harwich with their father when he was called thither on business. To them Harwich with its old walls and the houses crowned up within them, and its busy port with vessels <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> going <b>out,</b> was most delightful, and they always talked about that expedition {{as one of the most}} pleasant recollections of their lives.|$|R
50|$|The {{interviewees}} {{describe their}} experiences of <b>coming</b> out; falling <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of love; <b>and</b> struggling against prejudice, stereotypes, and discriminatory laws. The participants deliver their testimony with intelligence, grace, honesty, and conviction, creating an engaging and moving oral history.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Salton, too, showed much {{interest}} in the job, and was constantly <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out,</b> nothing escaping his observation.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you carry}} about with you, Mr. Mackellar?" [...] she asked. [...] "These last days, I see you always <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> {{with the same}} armful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] she answered, [...] "that {{there are}} no very nice people who live round here. The people whom I see <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of that house are not nice people at all." ...|$|E
5|$|Marcelo Adonay (organist), Simplicio Solis (organist), Diego C. Perez (pianist), Jose Conseco (pianist) and Doña Dolores Paterno (composer) {{were some}} of the {{recognized}} musicians in this era. Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times when the American occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> going <b>out</b> of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers.|$|R
50|$|On 15 February Wild and Quilt Arnold {{were arrested}} for helping one of his men in a jailbreak. Wild was placed in Newgate, where he {{continued}} to attempt to run his business. In the illustration from the True Effigy (top of page), Wild is pictured in Newgate, still with notebook in hand to account for goods <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> going <b>out</b> of his office. Evidence was presented against Wild for the violent jailbreak and for having stolen jewels during the previous August's installation of Knights of the Garter.|$|R
60|$|And bear her cross she did, {{about with}} her, <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> going <b>out,</b> for many a weary day. There was {{no change in}} her habits or demeanour; she was never {{listless}} {{for a moment in}} her school; she was more gay and amusing than ever, when she gathered her little ones around her for a story: but still there was the unseen burden, grinding her heart slowly, till she felt as if every footstep was stained with a drop of her heart's blood.... Why not? It would be the sooner over.|$|R
60|$|Eleanor {{had made}} up her mind to force him to talk to her, but she hardly knew how to commence: she must wait till the urn was gone, till the servant would no longer be <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
60|$|Musing thus, Frank at last {{dropped off}} to sleep. When he woke {{he found himself}} alone, his {{companion}} having left without disturbing him. From the noises around him of trains <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out,</b> Frank judged that the hour was late.|$|E
6000|$|... "With {{everybody}} <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out,</b> {{just as they}} pleased. I don't {{believe in}} private rooms in London clubs. What I've got to say can be said better sub dio. I suppose {{you know what it}} is that I've got to talk about." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Crampton then, {{remembering that}} he wanted a map in the next room, sprang into it, left the door half open <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> was <b>in</b> time to receive Her Ladyship with smiling face as she, ushered by Mr. Strongitharm, majestically sailed in.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have come}} near it," [...] said Jim, with rather grim humor. [...] "One gets used to that, and {{resolution}} counts when you're fighting a snowslide or a flood; but we're up against another proposition now. It's so to speak, mathematical; nothing <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> much going <b>out!</b> When {{we have no}} stores and money left we must quit." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{continued}} {{to go into}} work throughout the 1980s, with sometimes only 1 package <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> 1 going <b>out</b> on the same day. He {{continued to}} fill orders if he could, especially if he {{had some of the}} items in storage. Eventually when he could no longer work the company ended with a whimper rather than suddenly as many have assumed.|$|R
