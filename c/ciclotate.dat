It is an androgen ester - specifically, the C17β <b>ciclotate</b> (4-methylbicyclo2.2.2oct-2-ene-1-carboxylate) ester of nandrolone. Nandrolone cyclotate has potent and prolonged activity as an AAS when administered by intramuscular injection and {{is reported to have}} a similar duration to that of nandrolone decanoate via this route.|$|E
