5|$|Roland {{was born}} on 26 January 1899 and {{initially}} followed {{a career in the}} army. He married Sonia Rosemary Keppel on 16 November 1920 and they had three children: two sons, Henry and Jeremy (1927–1958); and a daughter, Rosalind. Death duties and the Second World War impacted greatly on the estate: staffing was a problem, and maintenance and general repair costs were unsustainable. The Home Guard requisitioned a section of the mansion as its headquarters and based a training school there. Hugh Pollock, husband of the author Enid Blyton, re-ignited his adulterous affair with Ida Crowe after arranging work there for her as a civilian secretary. Roland transformed the buildings that had previously been used as housing for the garden and stable staff into a Regency-style house. Flooring and doors were stripped from the old mansion to be incorporated in the new house, leaving just the basic structure of Cubitt's original mansion, which had been empty since 1947. Furniture was disposed of in a <b>clearance</b> <b>sale</b> at Dorking in mid-July 1952. Cubitt's mansion was within a designated preservation area, causing the local council to refuse any suggestions that were put forward for the old mansion to be used for commercial purposes. Contractors were brought in to demolish the mansion in 1953; the company may have encountered financial problems, as the basement was not fully destroyed and was left filled with rubble from the higher levels.|$|E

40|$|Retail {{items that}} are “cleared ” {{at the end of}} its season are {{referred}} to as seasonal merchandise. When merchandise is cleared, it is often sold below cost, at a price that will be called the residual value. Retail promotions or special sales events are designed to increase store traffic and sales and, ultimately, store profits. In general, these <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> are appropriate for those industries that face customers whose willingness to pay for the product diminishes over the selling season. In recent years more and more retail products have been sold on sale and at higher percentage markdowns. Pricing practices began to change in the late sixties as more products, particularly apparel products were sold at markdown. The increase in the seasonal variation of apparel prices over time is related to the growing importance of fashion. The uncertainty theory predicts the probability that a shirt is sold on sale, and the percentage markdown should be higher at the end of the season than at the beginning of the season. This study seeks to examine the influence of store attributes on <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> store satisfaction. A total of 664 shoppers were surveyed during <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> in three different Indian cities and we have constructed a model to study the <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> store attributes on store satisfaction. The <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> store satisfaction model discussed in this study can be used by retailers to develop a more effective <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> strategy...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} an optimal dynamic pricing {{strategy}} for <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> of a textile manufacturing company which allows last-minute cancellations of orders without penalty. This company faces the {{difficult task of}} determining the optimal prices to clear the unsold products which result from last-minute order cancellations of its customers. The presented results in this thesis provide the company with a mathematical tool which can be used to optimally and dynamically set prices to maximize the profits in the <b>clearance</b> <b>sales.</b> We assume that buyers are myopic, demand multiple units of products and have independent demand. We also assume that the company has limited information on the valuation of buyers. Using these assumptions, an analytical model and estimations from the historical data are developed and dynamic programming is used to devise an optimal dynamic pricing strategy for the <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> of the company. by Fırat Ileri.

We develop a simple model of intertemporal monopoly pricing under demand uncertainty, and show that <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> may be the optimal intertemporal selling policy. In this article, we derive the optimal selling policy of a monopolist who faces uncer-tainty about the level of demand. In contrast to much of the literature, we show that uniform pricing is not necessarily optimal. The optimal selling policy may instead involve clearance sales: the monopolist commits to supply only a limited quantity, and then charge a high price in the first period (palatable to high-valuation consumers) and a low price (affordable to low-valuation consumers) in the last period. The pre-mium associated with the rent offered to consumers that buy at the high price and the probability of being rationed at the low price induce all high-valuation consumer...|$|R
5000|$|Rather than storing {{merchandise}} {{until the}} following year, almost every U.S. store also has post-holiday <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> now, sometimes starting even before the holiday (especially Christmas and Halloween). Early discounts are often around 25%, but range from zero {{to as much as}} 50%, particularly if the [...] "regular" [...] prices were deliberately inflated as some stores do. 50% is common just after the holiday, often followed by 75%, and sometimes even 90%, at which point there is very little if anything left to choose from. Often during after-Christmas <b>clearance</b> <b>sales,</b> they let people know that this is their chance to buy everything they didn't get for Christmas, or as the phrase goes, [...] "everything Santa Claus forgot." [...] Particularly in Canada, “Boxing Day sales” draw large crowds of shoppers seeking after-Christmas closeout deals.|$|R

40|$|In almost thirty-four {{years after}} opening {{the doors to}} its first store, the Inditex Group has grown {{to be one of}} the largest fashion {{distributors}} in the world. Today the group operates more than four thousand retail stores in seventy-three different countries and under eight different brand concepts. Inditex's Zara brand division is renown for its high degree of vertical integration that allows it to maintain a tight control over the different stages of its supply chain and endows it with the flexibility to quickly react to current fashion trends. With a yearly average of 173 new store openings, Zara's accelerated growth rate has forced it to seek innovation and continuous improvement in its operations in order to maintain the competitive advantages that characterize it. One of its biggest challenges deals with the management of its <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> where the remaining inventory at the end of its sales campaign must be sold at a discounted price. These <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> are fast-paced and pricing decisions must be made for more than 11, 000 different fashion designs that Zara introduces each year, and considering the different market conditions that exist in the more than 70 countries where Zara operates. The proposed project consists in the development of a pricing mathematical model based on a sales forecasting model that estimates consumer's reactions to price discounts and a linear optimization model that makes profit-maximizing optimal price assignments. The current thesis details the design, implementation, and live test of the proposed model based pricing methodology that resulted in an approximate increase of six percent to Zara's <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> profits. by Rodolfo Carboni Borrasé.

50|$|Under the {{traditional}} model, garments and lines are compiled into fixed inventories {{for a particular}} season before delivery to store; the price of those garments is fixed, and remains relatively static until clearance-sale markdowns are employed {{to make way for}} new stock. The Fast Fashion model is more flexible, and the concept of seasons is often sub-divided, with mini-collections being delivered to stores on a more regular basis. This is designed to mitigate some of the impact of season-ending <b>clearance</b> <b>sales</b> (and the associated markdown cost implications).|$|R
