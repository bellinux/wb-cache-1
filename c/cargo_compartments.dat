25|$|Aircraft pallet {{capacity}} {{is measured by}} how many PMC-type LD7s (96 in × 125 in) can be stored. These pallets occupy approximately three LD3 positions (it occupies two positions of one row {{and half of the}} two positions of the following row) or four LD2 positions. PMCs can only be loaded in <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments</b> with large doors designed to accept them (small door compartments are container only).|$|E
25|$|In U.S. service, the P-8 fleet will be {{complemented by}} around 40 MQ-4C Triton {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance system to provide continuous surveillance. In January 2015, BAE Systems {{was awarded a}} contract for the Navy's High Altitude ASW (HAASW) Unmanned Targeting Air System (UTAS) program to develop a sub-hunting UAV equipped with a MAD for launching from the P-8. The P-8 cannot use the Navy's typical hose-and-drogue in-flight refueling method, instead featuring a flying boom receptacle on the upper-forward fuselage. For extended endurance, six additional fuel tanks from Marshall Aerospace are housed in the forward and rear <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1969, the Northern Pacific Railroad {{ordered a}} number of {{modified}} covered hopper cars from American Car and Foundry for transporting perishable food in bulk.

2500|$|The French {{placed a}} number of spare Mle 1893 guns on four-axle {{railroad}} carriages in 1915 to use as mobile heavy artillery. The mount with its gun weighed [...] and was [...] long. It could traverse a full 360° if its outriggers, two per side, were deployed. Photographic evidence shows that some mounts had built-up <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments</b> {{at both ends of}} the mount, which limited the gun's firing arc to approximately 90° on each side. It had a circular platform for the crew that had to be folded up for travel. Some guns were fitted with gun shields. It shared its railroad carriage with the 164mm Mle 1893/96 M and the Canon de 194 mm 1870/93.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, the Royal Thai government, {{seeking to}} {{extend the life of}} their C-123 fleet, placed a {{contract}} with the Mancro Aircraft Company, supported by the USAF, to convert a single C-123B to turboprop powerplants. Allison T56-A-7 turboprops were used {{and by the time the}} aircraft, dubbed C-123T, was complete it had new [...] "wet" [...] wings, an auxiliary power unit (APU) to assist with power movement of the control surfaces, and a heating system for the <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments</b> that also fed a new de-icing system. Budgetary restrictions forced the Thai government to abandon the program in 1981, and with a lack of interested parties development of the C-123T stopped. However, it concluded the life of the C-123 by making it the only aircraft type to operate under jet, piston, and turboprop engine power, and as a glider, during its history.|$|E

The nozzle of the hose had a quick-closing valve on the tanker's end and was tightly wrapped with copper wire, one end {{of which could be}} attached to a corresponding copper plate mounted in Question Mark to ground the hose. The C-1's would each carry a third crewman in the cargo compartment to reel out the hose, lower a supply rope, and to work the shutoff valve.|$|E

5000|$|For {{narrow body}} {{aircraft}} (e.g. Boeing 737, 757), every checked bag is required to be manually transferred to the airplane <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments</b> by carrier baggage handlers. Bags weigh an average of 32 lbs (14 kg) each, but many checked bags exceed the airline allowable weight of 50 lbs (23 kg). Manual lifting and handling of these bags is considered the main risk factor for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) among baggage handlers. Other factors may {{increase the risk of}} WMSDs, including time pressure, and awkward and restricted postures in small <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments.</b> ~In the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) studied the effectiveness of lifting assist devices and other control methods {{to reduce the risk of}} WMSDs ...|$|E

50|$|The C-133 was {{designed}} to meet the requirements for the USAF's Logistic Carrier Support System SS402L for a new strategic transport. The aircraft differed considerably from the C-74 Globemaster and C-124 Globemaster IIs that had preceded it. A high-mounted wing, external blister fairings on each side for the landing gear, and rear-loading and side-loading doors ensured that access to, and the volume of, the large <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment</b> were not compromised by these structures.
