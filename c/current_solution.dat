25|$|This {{notion of}} slow cooling {{implemented}} in the Simulated Annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions is a fundamental property of metaheuristics because it allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, the Simulated Annealing algorithms work as follows. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and then decides to move to it or {{to stay with the}} <b>current</b> <b>solution</b> based on either one of two probabilities between which it chooses {{on the basis of the}} fact that the new solution is better or worse than the current one. During the search, the temperature is progressively decreased from an initial positive value to zero and affects the two probabilities: at each step, the probability of moving to a better new solution is either kept to 1 or is changed towards a positive value; instead, the probability of moving to a worse new solution is progressively changed towards zero.|$|E
25|$|As chance {{would have}} it, in July 1940 Hodgkin had been {{introduced}} to A.W. Whitaker of Nash and Thompson, best known for their work on powered gun turrets. They {{began to talk about}} the scanning problem, and Hodgkin described their <b>current</b> <b>solution</b> of moving the dipole {{at the center of the}} parabola up and down while moving the parabola itself right and left. Hodgkin was not convinced this was a good solution and was proven correct when Whitaker built their first version of such a system in November. They found that the two motions combined to cause enormous vibrations in the entire system. Lovell and Hodgkin considered the problem and came up with the idea of causing the parabolic reflector to rotate around the axis extending from the nose of the aircraft, tracing out circles. By smoothly increasing the angle of the reflector compared to the forward axis while the circular motion continued, the net effect was a spiral scanning pattern. Whitaker was able to rapidly build such a system, scanning out a cone-shaped area 45degrees on either side of the nose.|$|E

50|$|A {{constructive}} heuristic {{is a type}} of {{heuristic method}} which starts with an empty solution and repeatedly extends the <b>current</b> <b>solution</b> until a complete solution is obtained.
