In general, the compounds were more active in TK 6 cells {{than they were in}} blood lymphocytes. Only 1 μM selenous acid increased the frequency of binucleated cells containing micronuclei (BNMN) in blood lymphocytes, while all three selenium compounds increased BNMN in TK 6 cells. In addition, combinations of selenous acid and potassium dichromate resulted in lower frequencies of BNMN than potassium dichromate alone in blood lymphocytes, while combinations of sodium selenate and potassium dichromate produced lower frequencies of BNMN than potassium dichromate alone in TK 6 cells. The concentrations of selenium compounds that were used, in combination with the medium components and the biological physiology of the whole blood lymphocytes and TK 6 cells, could have affected the redox potential of the <b>compounds,</b> <b>switching</b> the chemicals from a pro-oxidant to antioxidant status and vice-versa.

40|$|Dopamine D 2 and D 3 receptors are {{important}} pharmacological targets in Schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease. Intriguingly, {{many studies have}} shown that they form homo- and heterodimers, and they can be targeted in specific tissues with new drugs. In this direction, many efforts have been made to develop new molecules that are able to interact with these receptor dimeric complexes. Among various strategies for targeting dopamine receptors dimers, two distinct classes of compounds, such as bivalent and bitopic ligands, have gained particular attention and their use in pharmacology looks promising. Bivalent ligands target the orthosteric sites of the two monomers in the dimeric complex. Some studies have however questioned the bivalent properties of these ligands, which might interact with a receptor dimer or simply with a monomer and additionally, their high molecular weight makes them unfavorable for clinical use. The bitopic ligands target both the orthosteric and the allosteric sites in one monomeric receptor, thereby increasing selectivity over receptor subtypes. For dopamine D 2 and D 3 receptors, the bitopic ligand SB 269, 652 has been specifically demonstrated for dual action (dualsteric). This <b>compound</b> <b>switches</b> its antagonistic properties in favor of negative allosterism in the presence of dopamine receptor dimers and may offer therapeutic advantages and better tolerability in comparison with pure antagonists at D 2 receptors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} {{a new series of}} organosiloxane liquid crystals and the effects of dye addition by mixing and synthetic addition. The organosiloxane compounds are the result of a building block process that seeks to combine the high tilt and wide phase range properties of laterally substituted biphenyl benzoate mesogens with the polymer ruggedness of siloxane head groups. Initially the biphenyl benzoate mesogenic precursors are investigated with bromine, chlorine and fluorine substituents. The materials yield 20 - 45 deg tilt angles with 70 - 130 nCcm"-" 2 spontaneous polarisation. When combined with a siloxane head group, the only liquid crystal phase seen is a 50 deg C wide SmC* phase {{in each of the three}} compounds. The siloxane moieties micro-segregate and form a virtual backbone. As a consequence of the new molecular arrangement, temperature independent, near 45 deg or 45 deg tilt angles are measured for all three <b>compounds.</b> <b>Switching</b> time measurements reveal sub-millisecond switching down to 40 deg C below the I#->#SmC* transition. The attachment of a biphenyl benzoate molecule at either end of the siloxane core results in a series of bi-mesogenic compounds. These compounds yield 60 deg C wide antiferroelectric SmC*_A phases. The antiferroelectric nature is proposed to arise due to a bent conformation of the bi-mesogenic molecules. The spontaneous polarisation is further enhanced to 100 - 140 nCcm"-" 2 whilst the other electro-optic properties broadly follow similar trends to the mono-siloxane compounds. The synthesis of 45 deg tilt ferroelectric compounds opens up the possibility of many new device applications. The feasibility of transferring the benefits offered by ferroelectrics to the field of dyed and single polariser devices is investigated. Three commercial dyes are mixed with the laterally halogen substituted mono-mesogenic organosiloxanes. The phase sequence of the host is maintained along with the near 45 deg tilt angles of the host material. The magnitude of the spontaneous polarisation is reduced in line with the dilution effect of the non-liquid crystalline dye <b>compounds.</b> The <b>switching</b> times, although marginally increased with dye addition, still remained in the hundred microsecond regime demonstrated by the hosts. With the addition of one of the commercial dyes to an antiferroelectric host, three optically distinct states can be observed in a suitably oriented cell. This single polariser tri-state dye guest host device is only made possible by the near 45 deg tilt angle of the bi-mesogenic organosiloxane compounds. In order to introduce more dye into the organosiloxane hosts, a nitrostilbene dye molecule is grafted onto a siloxane core via an eleven carbon length alkyl chain. Following the pattern of the host organosiloxanes, monomeric and dimeric nitrostilbene compounds are studied, and the effect that grafting has on the dye's absorption properties is examined. This attempt to mimic the host structure proved highly successful, with the resultant organosiloxane dyes exhibiting liquid crystalline phases and showing complete miscibility with the organosiloxane hosts over the entire concentration range. Of particular note is the presence of antiferroelectricity in a mono-mesogenic ferroelectric host on addition of a dimeric non-ferroelectric dye. The results of this work show that the virtual backbone effect in low molar mass organosiloxane liquid crystals can be used to increase the solubility of a dye guest moiety and influence the stability and form of the mesophases. The ferroelectric / antiferroelectric characteristics of the liquid-crystal host can be retained and room temperature ferroelectric phases are created with broad temperature invariant properties. In this thesis, as well as the study of the physical and chemical properties of these new materials, some of the potential devices that now become possible are considered.

Global focus on the use of synthetic pyrethroids as an alternative means of rolling back malaria, and the reduction on the reliance on DDT may be the reason for the elevation of the concentrations of pyrethroids compounds recorded in the bed sediment of Aiba stream. Although residues of DDE were not found in all the samples, the mean concentration of DDT was about 60 times higher than that of DDD. Both DDD and DDE are degradation product of DDT (Yanez et al. 2002).

Despite their compositional diversity, isolation of crystalline chains has remained challenging. Here we report a simple crystallization technique that yields {{a series of}} dimer-based 1 D platinum chains. The colour of the Pt[superscript 2 +] <b>compounds</b> can be <b>switched</b> between yellow, orange and blue. Spontaneous oxidation in air is used to form black P[superscript 2. 33 +] needles. The loss of one electron per double salt results in a metallic d[subscript z[superscript 2]] state, as supported by quantum chemical calculations, and displays conductivity of 11 [*]S[*]cm[superscript − 1] at room temperature. This behaviour may open up {{a new avenue for}} controllable platinum chemistry. Japan.

40|$|REarranged during Transfection (RET) is a transmembrane {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} required for normal development and maintenance of neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Deregulation of RET and hyperactivity of the RET kinase is intimately connected to several types of human cancers, most notably thyroid cancers, making it an attractive therapeutic target for small-molecule kinase inhibitors. Novel approaches, allowing external control of the activity of RET, would be key additions to the signal transduction toolbox. In this work, photoswitchable RET kinase inhibitors based on azo-functionalized pyrazolopyrimidines were developed, enabling photonic control of RET activity. The most promising <b>compound</b> displays excellent <b>switching</b> properties and stability with good inhibitory effect towards RET in cell-free as well as live-cell assays and {{a significant difference in}} inhibitory activity between its two photoisomeric forms. As the first reported photoswitchable small-molecule kinase inhibitor, we consider the herein presented effector to be a significant step forward in the development of tools for kinase signal transduction studies with spatiotemporal control over inhibitor concentration in situ...|$|R
