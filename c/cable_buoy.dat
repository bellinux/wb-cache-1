50|$|The titan acorn {{barnacle}} is {{a suspension}} feeder, extending its cirri (modified legs) from the aperture {{at the top}} of the shell to catch plankton. As with other barnacles, sexual reproduction involves the passing of sperm along a long slender tube into the mantle cavity of a neighbouring barnacle. Fertilisation is internal and the larvae are planktonic. After passing through several stages over the course of about three weeks, they settle and undergo metamorphosis. They are gregarious and tend to settle near others of their species on rocks, on new man made structures such as <b>cables,</b> <b>buoys</b> and the hulls of boats, and also on the shells of bivalve molluscs.|$|R

In this paper, buoy system with surface <b>buoy,</b> <b>cable</b> segments with components, anchor and so on is modeled by applying multibody dynamics method. Then numerical method is used to solve the ordinary differential equations and dynamics simulations are achieved while anchor is casting from board. The trajectories, velocity and acceleration of different nodes in buoy system are obtained. The transient tension force of each part of cable is analyzed in the process of deployment.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the European FP 7 project NeXOS (Next generation Low-Cost Multifunctional Web Enabled Ocean Sensor Systems Empowering Marine, Maritime and Fisheries Management) is to develop cost-efficient innovative and interoperable in-situ sensors deployable from multiple platforms to support {{the development of a}} truly integrated Ocean Observing System. Therefore, several sensor systems will be developed in NeXOS project for specific technologies and monitoring strategies such as: ocean passive acoustics, ocean optics, and EAF monitoring (Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries), that will provide an integrated, technologically coherent system for multi-scale, multi-parameter monitoring of the oceans. For all these sensors system, NeXOS will develop the Smart Electronic Interface for Sensors and Instruments (SEISI) which is a set of standards and functionalities to enable Web-based sharing, discovery, exchange and processing of sensor observations, and operation of sensor systems. The architecture will satisfy international standards, defined by ISO, OGC, and the INSPIRE directive, to enable integration of marine sensors with existing observing systems. The SEISI will provide a multifunctional interface for many types of current sensors and instruments as well as the new multi-parameter sensor systems, and a standard interface for existing observing systems platforms such as: <b>cabled</b> observatories, <b>buoys,</b> gliders or Ferryboxes on ship or vessel of opportunity. To achieve the compatibility with all these platforms, the sensor systems developed in NeXOS based on SEISI will be designed to accomplish two main requirements of these platforms regarding the communication bandwidth and the power consumption.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{installation}} of a long-term buried ocean-floor broadband seismic station (MOBB) in Monterey Bay, California (USA), 40 km off-shore, at a water depth of 1000 m. The station was installed in April 2002 using a ship and ROV, in a collaborative effort between the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (BSL). The station {{is located on the}} western side of the San Gregorio Fault, a major fault in the San Andreas plate boundary fault system. In addition to a 3 -component CMG- 1 T seismometer package, the station comprises a current meter and Differential Pressure Gauge, both sampled at high-enough frequency (1 Hz) to allow the study of relations between background noise on the seismometers and ocean waves and currents. The proximity of several land-based broadband seismic stations of the Berkeley Digital Seismic Network allows insightful comparisons of land/ocean background seismic noise at periods relevant to regional and teleseismic studies. The station is currently autonomous. Recording and battery packages are exchanged every 3 months during scheduled one day dives. Ultimately, this station will be linked to shore using continuous telemetry (<b>cable</b> and/or <b>buoy)</b> and will contribute to the earthquake notification system in Northern California. We present examples of earthquake and noise data recorded during the first 6 months of operation of MOBB. Lessons learned from these and continued recordings will help understand the nature and character of background noise in regional off-shore environments and provide a reference for the installation of future off-shore temporary and permanent broadband seismic stations...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to determine the noise characteristics of a hydrophone streamer that had incorporated a number of noise reduction features, In the original system, the channels to which the depth-controller birds were attached were 3 to 4 times noisier than nonbird channels. Fortunately, the bird noise is near-field and is eliminated simply by increasing bird/hydrophone separation to 9 ft. On this cable, no other discrete noise sources are evident. The boat, propulsion system, lead-in <b>cable,</b> tail <b>buoy,</b> and ambient sea conditions (moderate seas) do not generate sig-nificant noise at towing speeds above 5 knots. The noise on individual hydrophones not near birds is mainly random with only a small coherent component traveling horizontally through {{the water from the}} direction of the boat. However, since the 145 ft hydrophone arrays of 20 detectors are much more effective in reducing random noise than coherent noise, the array output consists of approximately equal portions of each. A twofold decrease in the total noise-to-signal ratio would result from doubling the array length (to 290 ft) while maintaining the same hydrophone density. This would result in a four to fivefold decrease in thecoherent noise-to-signal ratio and a 30 percent decrease in the random noise-to-signal ratio. Addi-tional noise reduction would result from in-creasing the hydrophone density- and decreasing the motion sensitivity of the hydrophones. (The streamer hydrophones are not the motion canccl-ing type.) At a towing speed of 5. 3 knots, the noise level recorded on an array (not near a bird) is equiva-lent to pressures of 1 pbar. In normal operations with an g-gun sleeve exploder source, a stacked section signal-to-towing noise ratio of 3 was ob-tained at 3. 0 sec. However, the towing noise increases as the cube of the boat speed, and the S/N ratio would decrease by a factor of 11 if the boat speed were doubled. Conversely, decreasing the boat speed by 18 percent would double the signal-to-towing noise ratio...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Time-domain {{models were}} {{developed}} to predict the response of a tethered buoy subject to hydrodynamic loadings. A coupled analysis of the interaction of a buoy and its mooring is included and three-dimensional response is assumed. External loadings include hydrodynamic forces, tethers tensions, wind loadings {{and the weight of}} both <b>cable</b> and <b>buoy.</b> System nonlinearities include, large rotational and translational motions, and non-conservative fluid loadings. The mooring problem is formulated as a nonlinear two-point-boundary-value-problem. The problem is then converted to a combine initial-value and boundary-value problem to a discrete boundary-value problem at particular time, using a Newmark-like difference formula. At each instant in time the nonlinear boundary-value problem is solved by direct integration and using a successive iterative algorithm, such that boundary conditions are always satisfied. Buoy equations of motion are derived by both a small angle assumption and a large angle assumption. The small angle formulation uses the Eulerian angle for rotational coordinates. Coupling between the <b>buoy</b> and <b>cable</b> is performed by adopting the buoy equations of motion as boundary conditions at one end for the mooring problem. The rotational coordinates for the large angle formulation are represented by Euler parameters. The large angle formulation is solved by a predictor-corrector type of time integration of buoy motions constrained by tether forces. Coupling between the buoy and moorings is then enforced through matching of the velocity of the tether attachment points on the buoy with velocity of the tether ends; the velocities of tether attachment points serve as boundary conditions for the various mooring cables attached. Multiple time steps are used to account for different sizes of integration time step required for stability of solution in the buoy and tether. Numerical examples are provided to contrast the validity and capability of the formulations and solution techniques. Responses of three types of buoy (sphere, spar and disc) are predicted by the present models and compared to results obtained by experiments. Application of the present model to solve a multi-leg/multi-point mooring system is also provided...|$|R

40|$|OBSEA’s buoy is {{currently}} moored to the seafloor obser-vatory by an umbilical. Instead of using an umbilical in our simulation, we modeled the buoy to simulate a large power <b>cable</b> connecting the <b>buoy</b> to a technology on the seafloor. The {{purpose of this}} simulation was to predict the behavior of such a cable and a moored platform at sea using real-world conditions. Observation platforms at sea need power cables for energy. Such platforms and cables are exposed con-stantly to the dynamic behavior of sea waves, wind and current. It is useful to carry out numerical simulations of how a large underwater power cable connecting an ocean sur-face platform to a seafloor technology would behave with regard to marine conditions prior to design and installa-tion at sea. This would help a manufacturer identify critical parameters that could af-fect the cable in the field, for instance, in projects that would require mooring wind turbines in the ocean. We conducted a simulation experiment using a small, existing platform, OBSEA, located 4 kilometers offshore the Vilanova i la Geltrú coast in a fishing protected area of the Catalan coast of Spain. OBSEA is a cabled seafloor observatory connected to a station on the coast by a power-and-communication cable. The station located onshore provides the power supply and a fiber-optic communication link, while carrying out alarm management tasks and storing data in real time.

40|$|The marine {{sector of}} the Campi Flegrei caldera has started to be {{monitored}} over the long-term with a seafloor equipment deployed in the Gulf of Pozzuoli from 2008. The equipment includes a set of geophysical, oceanographic and environmental sensors integrated in a marine platform that was specifically designed for real-time monitoring. This platform, named CUMAS (Cabled Underwater Multidisciplinary Acquisition System), was installed {{in the center of}} the Gulf at about 2. 5 km south of Pozzuoli where the sea depth is about 100 m [Iannaccone et al., 2010]. The CUMAS system consists of a seafloor module connected by <b>cable</b> to a <b>buoy</b> (elastic beacon type) equipped with autonomous power supply systems, real-time data- transmission devices and a weather station. The core of CUMAS is the seafloor module that contains geophysical and oceanographic sensors, in particular, a three-component broadband seismometer, a best in class three axis MEMS accelerometer, a low-frequency hydrophone and a high-resolution sea bottom pressure recorder. A single-point acoustic, three-component, water-current meter and a water-temperature sensor were also installed to monitor some water local physical parameters. A set of status sensors, which also included a digital compass and a two-component digital tilt-meter, were added to track the attitude of the module over the course of the experiment. The marine monitoring system transmits the data in real-time and is integrated into the Monitoring Center in Naples managed by INGV-Osservatorio Vesuviano. A continuous GPS station has been installed since the end of 2011 on the top of the buoy. The elastic beacon buoy forms a structure which is rigidly connected by a mechanical cable to the ballast on the sea bottom, a submerged float at the base of the buoy maintains tension on the cable and ensure the overall buoyancy of the system. In this way, any vertical movement of the seafloor propagates rigidly to the emerged part of the buoy itself, allowing measurement of the vertical movement of the sea floor by the GPS station. The analysis of about 17 months of continuous GPS data, from January 2012 to May 2013, revealed an overall uplift of about 3 - 4 cm allowing a first measurement of vertical seafloor displacement in the Campi Flegrei caldera [De Martino et al., 2014]. A new opportunity to enhance the deployed system was given by a national project, EMSO-MedIT, which is providing the necessary resources to expand the data acquisition to other areas of the Gulf of Pozzuoli. New improved systems similar to CUMAS are going to be deployed in three additional marine sites of the Gulf of Pozzuoli and the existing tide gauges network will be renewed with state-of-art sensors. The overall new monitoring infrastructure will allow to extensively map the seafloor vertical displacement and to improve the interpretative models of the bradyseism phenomenon including a more accurate location of earthquakes in the marine areas and extending to lower magnitude values the detection of the seismic activity...|$|R
