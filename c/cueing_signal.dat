40|$|Introduction: In Parkinson’s disease {{rest and}} action tremor may occur. High {{frequency}} {{deep brain stimulation}} in basal ganglia nuclei {{has proved to be}} effective in the suppression of tremor. In addition, rhythmic auditory cues have shown to result in improved performance of repetitive movements, possibly by suppressing action tremor. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if electrical stimulation has similar effects on rest and action tremor, and whether in case of action tremor, the effect of electrical stimulation is similar to or enhanced by auditory cueing. Methods: Three exercises were carried out by 7 Parkinson’s disease patients treated with deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus: 1) sitting at rest; 2) performing a hand tapping movement as fast as possible; 3) performing hand movements on the rhythm of an auditory <b>cueing</b> <b>signal.</b> Inertial sensors registered the movement of the hands during the tests. The exercises were repeated for four different stimulation settings. Results: Electrical stimulation may either enhance or suppress rest and/or action tremor. Power spectral density analysis shows that tremor suppression is accompanied by an increase in relative power in the low frequency band for both rest and action tremor. Most patients could (temporarily) phase lock their hand movements to the <b>cueing</b> <b>signal</b> of 1. 6 Hz. Cueing signals at higher frequencies (3. 2 and 4. 8 Hz) could result in (n:m) phase locking of tremor as well as movement. Conclusion: Electrical stimulation results in a re-scaling of tremor, while auditory cueing may enhance suppression...|$|E
40|$|Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{patients}} show {{a higher}} {{ability to perform}} repetitive movements when they are cued by external stimuli, suggesting that rhythmic synchronization with an auditory timekeeper can be achieved {{in the absence of}} intact basal ganglia function. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is another therapeutic method that improves movement performance in PD and may suppress or enhance action tremor. However, the combined effect of these therapies on action tremor has not been studied yet. In this pilot study, we thus test the effect of both DBS in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and auditory cueing on movement performance and action tremor. Methods: 7 PD patients treated with (bilateral) STN DBS were asked to move one hand or foot between two dots, separated by 30 cm as indicated on the table or the floor. The movement frequency was dictated by a metronome with a frequency in the range of 1. 6 to 4. 8 Hz. Each test was repeated three times for each extremity, with different stimulation settings applied during each repetition. The power spectral density patterns of recorded movements were studied. Tremor intermittency was taken into account by classifying each 2 -second window of the recorded angular velocity signals as a tremor or non-tremor window. By determining the phase locking value it was tested whether movement or tremor was synchronized with the auditory cue. Results: While action tremor presence or absence did not affect the level of synchronization of the movement signal with the auditory cue for the different metronome frequencies, the number of extremities showing action tremor was significantly reduced under external cueing conditions in combination with DBS. In this respect the cueing frequencies of 1. 6 and 4. 8 Hz showed similar effects, suggesting that the frequency of the <b>cueing</b> <b>signal</b> is not that critical. Conclusion: The combination of deep brain stimulation and auditory cueing, which both are proposed to involve the activation of cerebellar circuits, shows an enhanced action tremor reduction in Parkinson’s disease...|$|E

Thirty-six healthy young adults participated in the study. Response time switch costs were most pronounced on proactive task-cuing, whereas perseveration errors showed highest prevalence on retroactive transition-cuing. Principal component analyses revealed evidence for two components corresponding to the distinction between proactive and retroactive task-cuing, thus implying a dissociation between proactively and retroactively cued task switching. Retroactive transition-cuing might be particularly sensitive to frontal lesions of the cortex. ...|$|R

In Experiment II, the multiple variable-interval variable-interval condition was shifted to multiple extinction variable-interval for one group, to multiple variable-time variable-interval for a second group, and was unchanged for the third group. The two experimental conditions produced identical patterns of response-rate reduction in the altered component, but the multiple extinction variable-interval condition produced positive contrast, whereas the multiple variable-time variable-interval condition did not.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that people employ {{a common set of}} sustained operations (retrieval mode) when preparing to remember different kinds of episodic information. In two experiments, however, there was no evidence for the pattern of brain activity commonly assumed to index these operations. In both experiments event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded time-locked to alternating preparatory <b>cues</b> <b>signalling</b> that participants should prepare for different retrieval tasks. One <b>cue</b> <b>signalled</b> episodic retrieval: remember the location where the object was presented in a prior study phase. The other signalled semantic retrieval: identify the location where the object is most commonly found (Experiment 1) or identify the typical size of the object (Experiment 2). In both experiments, only two trials of the same task were completed in succession. This enabled ERP contrasts between ‘repeat’ trials (the cue on the preceding trial signalled the same retrieval task), and ‘switch’ trials (the cue differed from the preceding trial). There were differences between the ERPs elicited by the preparatory task cues in Experiment 1 only: these were evident only on switch trials and comprised more positive-going activity over right-frontal scalp for the semantic than for the episodic task. These findings diverge from previous outcomes where the activity differentiating <b>cues</b> <b>signalling</b> preparation for episodic or semantic retrieval has been restricted to right-frontal scalp sites, comprising more positive-going activity for the episodic than for the semantic task. While {{these findings are consistent with}} the view that there is not a common set of operations engaged when people prepare to remember different kinds of episodic information, an alternative account is offered here, which is that these outcomes are a consequence of structural and temporal components of the experiment design...|$|R
40|$|Objective We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} covert preparation of saccadic eye movements results in spatially specific modulations of somatosensory processing. Methods ERPs {{were recorded in}} a spatial cueing experiment where auditory cues preceded tactile stimuli delivered {{to the left or}} right hand. In the Saccade task, <b>cues</b> <b>signalled</b> that an eye movement towards the left or right hand had to be prepared. In the Covert Attention task, <b>cues</b> <b>signalled</b> the direction of a covert shift of tactile attention. Results A lateralized component previously observed during cued shifts of spatial attention (ADAN) was elicited in the cue–target interval in both tasks. The somatosensory N 140 component was enhanced for tactile stimuli presented to the hand on the cued side. This modulation was present not just in the Covert Attention task, but also in the Saccade task. Longer-latency effects of spatial cueing were only present in the Covert Attention task. Conclusions Covert shifts of attention and saccade preparation have similar effects on early stages of tactile processing, suggesting that both are mediated by overlapping control processes. Significance These findings support the premotor theory of attention by demonstrating that the programming of eye movements has spatially selective effects on somatosensory processing...|$|R

The cue validity effect has often been explained with a limited capacity attentional mechanism improving the perceptual quality at the cued location. Alternatively, the cueing effect can also be explained by unlimited capacity models that assume a weighted combination of noisy responses across the two locations. We compare two weighted integration models, a linear model and a sum of weighted likelihoods model based on a Bayesian observer. While qualitatively these models are similar, quantitatively they predict different cue validity effects as the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) increase. To test these models, 3 observers performed in a cued discrimination task of Gaussian targets with an 80 % valid precue across a broad range of SNR’s. Analysis of a limited capacity attentional switching model was also included and rejected. The sum of weighted likelihoods model best described the psychophysical results, suggesting that human observers approximate a weighted combination of likelihoods, and not a weighted linear combination...|$|R

During the response-priming test we exposed participants to both food pictures and to Pavlovian cues predictive of those food pictures, and examined their biasing effect on instrumental choice. As expected, obese participants showed higher priming rates for palatable, high-calorie foods (potato chips and chocolate) relative to low-calorie foods (lettuce and courgette) whereas healthy-weight individuals did not show a difference between priming rates for these two food types.

40|$|The defaultmode network (DMN) is {{the core}} brain systemsupporting {{internally}} oriented cognition.

Right anterior insula (rAI), a core hub of the salience network (SN), has been proposed to control the switching from DMN to task-relevant brain networks. Little is currently known about the extent of anticipatory processes subserved by DMN and SN during switching. We investigated anticipatory DMN and SN modulation using a novel cued-switching task of between-state (rest-to-task/task-to-rest) and within-state (task-to-task) transitions. Twenty healthy adults performed the task implemented in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design. Increases in activity were observed in the DMN regions in response to <b>cues</b> <b>signalling</b> upcoming rest. DMN attenuation was observed for rest-to-task switch cues. Obversely, DMN was up-regulated by task-to-rest cues. The strongest rAI response was observed to rest-to-task switch cues.

Our data provide the first evidence that DMN modulation occurs rapidly and can be elicited by short duration <b>cues</b> <b>signalling</b> rest- and task-related state switches.

Background: There are some concerns that the compellingness of flight deck tunnel displays renders the task they support more resistant to interruptions, thus preventing the pilot from noticing <b>cues</b> <b>signaling</b> the need to divert attention to other tasks. Methods: Forty pilots flew three curved approaches in a high-fidelity simulation using a synthetic vision system (SVS) display.

The display layout supporting the primary flight task (tunnel vs. baseline display), the nature of the <b>cue</b> <b>signaling</b> the need to divert attention to the path selection task (visual vs. auditory-visual cue), and the cost of not performing the secondary task were manipulated to investigate their influence on task prioritization. Results: The modality and priority of the cue affected the frequency of the switch to the secondary task. Furthermore, pilots flying with a tunnel display were more likely to detect the change in the weather and were easily interrupted by the secondary task when priority was high.

In both experiments, participants responded faster to the location compared to the identity conditions. Multivariate spatio-temporal partial least square (ST-PLS) analysis of the scalp-recorded data revealed supramodal "where" preparatory processes between 300 - 600 msec and 600 - 1200 msec at central and posterior parietal electrode sites in anticipation of both auditory and visual targets. Furthermore, preparation for pitch processing was captured at modality-specific temporal regions between 300 and 700 msec, and preparation for shape processing was detected at occipital electrode sites between 700 and 1150 msec.

Despite the well-documented {{role of the}} amygdala in predator odor-induced fear, evidence for the relative contribution of the specific nuclei that comprise this structurally heterogeneous structure is conflicting. In an effort to clarify this we examined neural activity, via electrophysiological recordings, in amygdala subnuclei to controlled and repeated presentations of a predator odor: cat urine. Defensive behaviors, characterized by avoidance, decreased exploration, and increased risk assessment, were observed in adult male hooded Wistar rats (n = 11) exposed to a cloth impregnated with cat urine. Electrophysiological recordings of the amygdala (777 multiunit clusters) were subsequently obtained in freely breathing anesthetized rats exposed to cat urine, distilled water, and eugenol via an air-dilution olfactometer. Recorded units selectively responded to cat urine, and frequencies of responses were distributed differently across amygdala nuclei; medial amygdala (MeA) demonstrated the greatest frequency of responses to cat urine (51. 7 %), followed by the basolateral and basomedial nuclei (18. 8 %) and finally the central amygdala (3. 0 %). Temporally, information transduction occurred primarily from the cortical amygdala and MeA (ventral divisions) to other amygdala nuclei. Interestingly, MeA subnuclei exhibited distinct firing patterns to predator urine, potentially revealing aspects of the underlying neurocircuitry of predator odor processing and defensiveness. These findings highlight the critical involvement of the MeA in processing olfactory <b>cues</b> <b>signaling</b> predator threat and converge with previous studies to indicate that amygdala regulation of predator odor-induced fear is restricted to {{a particular set of}} subnuclei that primarily include the MeA, particularly the ventral divisions...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [48]- 55). The {{present study}} {{examined the effects of}} olfactory bulbectomy, an animal model of depression, on conditioned inhibition as measured with fear-potentiated startle, an animal model of anxiety. The study was based on cognitive research suggesting that individuals diagnosed with either depression or anxiety share an attentional bias to negative or threatening stimuli. Animal studies suggest that bulbectomized animals demonstrate an increased vulnerability to stress as measured by fear-potentiated startle and shock sensitization. Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that olfactory bulbectomy would result in a biased attention, similar to that noted in depressed individuals, to a <b>cue</b> <b>signaling</b> danger (conditioned excitor) at the expense of a <b>cue</b> <b>signaling</b> safety (conditioned inhibitor). Specifically, bulbectomized animals were expected to be less able to inhibit their fear (conditioned inhibition) to a light previously paired with a shock when the light was accompanied by a noise safety signal not paired with shock relative to sham-operated and unoperated animals. The results of the study indicated that bulbectomized animals were able to inhibit their fear when presented with the conditioned inhibitor. Bulbectomized animals did not differ from sham-operated or unoperated animals in their ability to acquire conditioned inhibition of fear-potentiated startle. Further, bulbectomized animals did not differ from the control animals on baseline startle amplitudes or the acquisition of fear-potentiated startle. As such, the hypothesis was not supported. However, several possible empirical and theoretical explanations were identified and suggestions for future research on the relationship between depression and anxiety were explored. M. A.
