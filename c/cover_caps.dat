50|$|A minor {{annoyance}} {{with the}} camera is that the <b>cover</b> <b>caps</b> for the remote-control socket and PC Sync sockets are not tethered to the body, and so are very easy to lose or misplace in use. Fortunately, these caps are common to many Nikon models (F100, D2, etc.) and so are readily and cheaply available.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{satellite data}} {{used to construct}} mean snow <b>cover</b> <b>caps</b> for the Northern Hemisphere. The zonally averaged snow cover from these maps {{is used to calculate}} the seasonal cycle of zonally averaged surface albedo. The effects of meltwater on the surface, solar zenith angle, and cloudiness are parameterized and included in the calculations of snow and ice albedo. The data allows a calculation of surface albedo for any land or ocean 10 deg latitude band as a function of surface temperature ice and snow cover; the correct determination of the ice boundary {{is more important than the}} snow boundary for accurately simulating the ice and snow albedo feedback...|$|E
50|$|One final {{development}} of the Stielhandgranate was implemented during the later stages of the First World War, and was very minor in differences to the original. Identical in function to the Model 1916, but yet another change was made to the actual priming system. The base of the Stielhandgrante's handle was slightly redesigned, and a metal <b>cover</b> <b>cap</b> was introduced. This cap concealed the porcelain bead and pull cord, allowing it to simply rest freely inside of the handle. The <b>cover</b> <b>cap</b> would simply be pulled off, and the M16's motions followed.|$|R

The island {{consists}} of a granite base and a calcarenite mantle; its margins steeply over-hanging and eroded. Typical vegetation is a low Nitre Bush (Nitraria billardierei) shrubland. Cap Island Conservation Park was constituted by statute in 1972 to conserve a sea bird breeding area and Australian Sea-lion (Neophoca cinerea) and New Zealand Fur-seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) haul-out areas. Cap Island also bears the alternative name of Rocky Island.|$|R

40|$|The Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO) {{incorporates}} plated seals for {{use with}} (1) the port cover plates, (2) process valves of the shield plug, and (3) test plug ofthe <b>cover</b> <b>cap.</b> These seals are required to maintain leakage rates as low as 10 {sup - 7 } scc/atm-sec. in the <b>cover</b> <b>cap</b> to test plug seal. The seals are manufactured by EG&G division of Perkin Elmer. Currently, the MCO design calls for use of silver or gold plated seals in these locations. The seal plating materials are deposited on Inconel 718 or X- 750 substrates. Some of these seals are reused several times in service on the MCO. The MCO manufacturer has built several MCOs {{and is in the}} leak testing stage and has had great difficulty obtaining acceptable leakage rates at their plant in Camden, New Jersey. The seal manufacturer was called in to evaluate the situation and now the seal manufacturer recommends tin plated seals. This evaluation examines the Corrosion resistance and thermal stability of tin plating on the seals. The use of tin plating on MCO seals was evaluated for corrosion resistance and thermal stability. The corrosion resistance of tin in the expected MCO environments is acceptable. The effect of radiation hardening will offset creep deformation results. However, a low melting point indicates unsuitability at significantly elevated temperatures...|$|R

The restoration work {{was carried out by}} R Thompson & Sons Ltd, millwrights of Alford, Lincolnshire. The copper <b>covered</b> <b>cap</b> was rebuilt and clad in aluminium for maintenance reasons. A new stock and two new sails were made, and the fantail rebuilt. The mill was struck by lightning in June 1971, a stock being split and a sail damaged. The sack chain saved the mill from being burnt down by giving a route for the lightning to earth. When the mill was repaired, a lightning conductor was added to the mill.|$|R

40|$|The MCO is {{designed}} to facilitate the removal, processing and storage of the spent nuclear fuel currently stored in the East and West K-Basins. The MCO is a stainless steel canister approximately 24 inches in diameter and 166 inches long with <b>cover</b> <b>cap</b> installed. The shell and the collar which is welded to the shell are fabricated from 304 / 304 L dual certified stainless steel for the shell and F 304 /F 304 L dual certified for the collar. The shell has a nominal thickness of 1 / 2 inch. The top closure consists of a shield plug with four processing ports and a locking ring with jacking bolts to pre-load a metal seal under the shield plug. The fuel is placed in one of four types of baskets, excluding the SPR fuel baskets, in the fuel retention basin. Each basket is then loaded into the MCO which is inside the transfer cask. Once all of the baskets are loaded into the MCO, the shield plug with a process tube is placed into the open end of the MCO. This shield plug provides shielding for workers when the transfer cask, containing the MCO, is lifted from the pool. After being removed from the pool, the locking ring is installed and the jacking bolts are tightened to pre-load the metal main closure seal. The cask is then sealed and the MCO taken to the Cold Vacuum Drying (CVD) facility for bulk water removal and vacuum drying through the process ports. Covers for the process ports may be installed or removed as needed per operating procedures. The MCO is then transferred to the Canister Storage Building (CSB), in the closed transfer cask. At the CSB, the MCO is then removed from the cask and becomes one of two MCOs stacked in a storage tube. MCOs will have a <b>cover</b> <b>cap</b> welded over the shield plug providing a complete welded closure. A number of MCOs may be stored with just the mechanical seal to allow monitoring of the MCO pressure, temperature, and gas composition...|$|R

40|$|Materials {{acting as}} a source of {{environmental}} contamination often consist of contaminated soil or sediment. A source also could involve sludge, debris, solid waste, non aqueous-phase liquids, equipment, drums, or storage tanks. 3 Remediation of contaminated sites often involves containment systems to address the contaminant source(s). Containment systems may operate ex situ and/or in situ. Ex situ processes may involve excavating contaminated source material and placing it in an engineered containment area (cell) that is lined, such as a landfill, or an area designated as a consolidation unit that is typically unlined. An ex situ source containment system often includes a <b>cover</b> (<b>cap),</b> which is required for a closed landfill.

The original model had a single jack on the front panel for an FT-243 style crystal. A chain of frequency multipliers allowed crystals in the 8 MHz range to be used. Many such crystals were available as military surplus in the 1950s. Later models had jacks for four crystals with a switch to select which one to use. Models were available for the 6 meter and 2 meter amateur bands, as well for as the VHF aircraft airband where they were often used as ground stations at smaller airfields. The civil defense model was painted yellow with CD insignia, and was available for the 6 and 2 meter bands.
