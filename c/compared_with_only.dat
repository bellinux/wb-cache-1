40|$|Job {{rotation}} {{is often}} advocated to reduce workload, but its efficacy has seldom been investigated. The {{aim of this}} study is to compare the work demands, workload, and recovery among truck driving, refuse collecting, and rotating between these two jobs, between days and during the day. Three teams of 3 employees each participated in this study. Work demands were assessed by systematic observation of tasks and activities. Workload was quantified by means of heart rate, oxygen uptake, subjective ratings, and urinary excretion rates of catecholamines. Recovery was quantified by excretion rates of catecholamines after work. Job rotation between driving and collecting is an effective measure to reduce physical workload as <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> collecting <b>only</b> and to decrease mental workload as <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> driving <b>only.</b> However, job rotation resulted in increased physical workload as <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> driving <b>only.</b> Job rotation did not increase mental workload as <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> collecting <b>only.</b> No effects were seen on recovery. No differences were found between rotating between days and during the day. Actual or potential applications of this research include the recommendation that before job rotation is introduced, its efficacy be determined in terms of well-chosen workload measures because a reduction in work demands does not directly imply a reduction in workload. Therefore, job rotation might be less effective than expected...|$|R

40|$|P> 1. Clinical and {{experimental}} evidence {{highlights the importance}} of the renin-angiotensin system in renovascular hypertension. Furthermore, genetic factors affecting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) could influence the development of renovascular hypertension. 2. To test the effect of small gene perturbations on the development of renovascular hypertension, mice harbouring two or three copies of the Ace gene were submitted to 4 weeks of two-kidney, one-clip (2 K 1 C) hypertension. Blood pressure (BP), cardiac hypertrophy, baroreflex sensitivity and blood pressure and heart rate variability were assessed and compared between the different groups. 3. The increase in BP induced by 2 K 1 C was higher in mice with three copies of the Ace gene <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> mice <b>with</b> <b>only</b> two copies (46 vs 23 mmHg, respectively). Moreover, there was a 3. 8 -fold increase in the slope of the left ventricle mass/BP relationship in mice with three copies of the Ace gene. Micewith three copies of the Ace gene exhibited greater increases in cardiac and serum ACE activity than mice <b>with</b> <b>only</b> two copies of the gene. Both baroreflex bradycardia and tachycardia were significantly depressed in mice with three copies of the Ace gene after induction of 2 K 1 C hypertension. The variance in basal systolic BP was greater in mice with three copies of the Ace gene after 2 K 1 C hypertension <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> those <b>with</b> <b>only</b> two copies of the gene (106 vs 54 %, respectively). In addition, the low-frequency component of the pulse interval was higher mice with three copies of the Ace gene after 2 K 1 C hypertension <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> those <b>with</b> <b>only</b> two (168 vs 86 %, respectively). Finally, in mice with three copies of the Ace gene, renovascular hypertension induced a 6. 1 -fold increase in the sympathovagal balance <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> a 3. 2 -fold increase in mice <b>with</b> <b>only</b> two copies of the gene. 4. Collectively, these data provide direct evidence that small genetic disturbances in ACE levels per se have an influence on haemodynamic, cardiac mass and autonomic nervous system responses in mice under pathological perturbation.

25|$|According to Andrew Beveridge, a Professor of Sociology at Queens College, between 2000 and 2005, {{young women}} in their twenties earned more than their male {{counterparts}} in some large urban centers, including Dallas (120%), New York (117%), Chicago, Boston, and Minneapolis. A major {{reason for this is that}} women have been graduating from college in larger numbers than men, and that many of those women seem to be gravitating toward major urban areas. In 2005, 53% of women in their 20s working in New York were college graduates, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>only</b> 38% of men of that age.

25|$|The line {{formation}} was {{the most}} favoured, as it offered the maximum firepower, about 1000 to 1500 bullets per minute. Though the manual laid down that lines were to be formed in three ranks, the lines were often formed only two ranks deep, especially in the Peninsula. While the French favoured column formation, the line formation enabled all muskets available to fire at the enemy. In contrast, only the few soldiers in the first rows of the column (about 60) were able to fire. British infantry were far better trained in musketry than most armies on the continent (30 rounds per man in training for example, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>only</b> 10 in the Austrian Army) and their volleys were notably steady and effective.|$|E

25|$|Patai {{states in}} his other book The Myth of the Jewish Race that {{percentage}} of cousin marriage among Jews varies extensively with geographic location. Among Israeli Ashkenazi Jews, who originate mainly from Europe, the first-cousin marriage rate was measured in a 1955-7 study at 1.4% and other cousin marriages at 1.06% of all marriages. But among non-Ashkenazim the first-cousin marriage rate was 8.8% and an additional 6.0% of marriages were between more distant cousins. Thus a total 14.6% of marriages between non-Askenazim were consanguineous <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>only</b> 2.5% for Ashkenazim. The highest frequencies of cousin marriages were found among Jews from Iraq (28.7%) and Iran (26.3%). High rates were also found among couples from Yemen (18.3%), Aden (17.8%), Tunisia (13.4%), and among Oriental Jews from the USSR (6.9%). Jews from Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey saw rates of 7–10.7%. A later 1969–70 study rated the first-cousin marriage rate among Ashkenazim at 0.3% and other cousin marriages at 1.0%, while for non-Askenazim the respective figures were 6.2% and 8.1%. Among the Habbani Jews in Israel, 56% of marriages are between first cousins. The Samaritans also had very high rates of inbreeding, with 43% of marriages between first cousins and 33.3% between other cousins.|$|E
