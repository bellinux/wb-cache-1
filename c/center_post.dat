25|$|The Visalia Town <b>Center</b> <b>Post</b> Office is a {{registered}} historic building on Acequia Avenue in downtown Visalia, California. The Art Deco structure opened in 1933 and {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1985 due to its architectural and engineering significance. It remains in operation as a post office.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} process for this building was highly labor-intensive, {{as seen in}} the careful masonry, the elaborate terrazzo floor, and the use of parquet rather than strip flooring in the workroom and office areas. The level of craftsmanship was uniformly high in most Depression-era government construction, and the Visalia Town <b>Center</b> <b>Post</b> Office provides an excellent example of this.|$|E
25|$|The Visalia Town <b>Center</b> <b>Post</b> Office, {{designed}} by Fresno-native architect William D. Coates, {{conforms to the}} standard symmetry used in most post offices of the time, but has unusually sophisticated terracotta detailing in shapes directly derivative of 1920s Art Deco motifs. Decorative dark-brown brick contrasts the light-tan brick used {{for the bulk of}} the building's walls. The interior ornamentation is lavish, and includes cast aluminum, marble, and a decorative multi-colored terrazzo floor.|$|E

25|$|During the Great Depression the Public Works Administration {{often used}} Art Deco {{elements}} in a primarily classical and monumental framework. The Visalia Town Center US Post Office thus presages the style and aesthetic of much subsequent government architecture in the thirties. This style of architecture was commonly used in private projects in the 1920s and {{is often associated with}} decadently luxurious shops and hotels, though by the time the Town <b>Center</b> <b>Post</b> Office was built the Depression had halted most of these private projects. Although the Visalia Post Office uses Art Deco ornamental motifs, the structure is more of a monolithic monument than a pretty piece of art, a characteristic typical of Government construction in the period in which it was built.|$|E
500|$|Post Oak Mall was {{the first}} mall {{in the city of}} College Station, and as of 2008, it is the largest mall in the Brazos Valley. There were {{concerns}} that the mall would hurt existing area businesses, but CBL was certain the mall would have a [...] "trickle-down" [...] effect that would result in the Harvey Road area to be [...] "fully developed with smaller strip shopping centers." [...] Before the mall opened, plans were already underway for one such <b>center,</b> <b>Post</b> Oak Village, which began constructed {{to the west of the}} mall along Harvey Road. Farther west, zoning was approved for new office complexes and commercial developments. Immediately south of the mall, an additional commercial zone was approved, along with [...] along the freeway.|$|E
500|$|Analysis of {{the cockpit}} area found there was bird residue and {{feathers}} on the windshield and <b>center</b> <b>post.</b> The remains of 15cowbirds were found within [...] {{of the end of}} Runway 20L. These birds, the NTSB found, had collided with the aircraft structure. Examination of the two engines found evidence of foreign objects, which consisted of minute fragments of feathers. The objects had blocked cooling ports, and had damaged the rotor assembly inside the engine. It was found the left engine had encountered 14 separate bird strikes and the right engine had encountered five. When the birds entered the engine, they caused the compressors to stall; these were the two loud bangs the witnesses heard as the aircraft took off. As the aircraft passed over the perimeter fence, the left engine flamed out, and the trail of smoke was unburned fuel passing through the hot combustion and turbine sections. Investigators determined it was possible the flight crew had managed to restart the left engine.|$|E

2500|$|Admiral Callaghan wasted further {{time trying}} to {{reconcile}} the ranges and bearing information reported by radar from Helena and other ships with his limited sight picture to no avail, mostly because the radar operators, without {{the direction of a}} modern Command Information Center (CIC), were reporting on vessels that were out of sight, and Callaghan was trying to coordinate the battle from the bridge, not a Command <b>Center.</b> (<b>Post</b> battle analysis of this and other early surface actions were to directly lead to the plotting crews and fighting the battle from the modern Command centers before the middle of 1943.) ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1916 through 1920 {{she served}} as Anatomist at the Army Medical Museum, now the National Museum of Health and Medicine, on the Walter Reed Army Medical <b>Center</b> <b>post</b> in Washington, D.C. Her records at the museum, {{consisting}} of correspondence, notes, reports, logbooks, and other research materials, state that her research centered on identifying mosquitoes, including a project working with specimens sent in from military posts {{that resulted in the}} production of a Museum film, [...] "Mosquito Eradication," [...] in 1918.

2500|$|Another type of team boat uses a [...] "horse whim," [...] a type {{of horse}} mill. It has a large {{revolving}} wheel in the middle, and a <b>center</b> <b>post</b> known as a [...] "whim" [...] (or horse capstan). The horses, which {{are attached to the}} horse whim, walk around in a circle, causing the wheel or capstan to revolve, which in turn rotates gears that rotate the paddles, or bucket wheels. The team boat of this style consisted of two complete hulls, united by a deck or bridge, but separated far enough apart to allow the paddle wheel to be set between them. They are sharp at both ends, and can be propelled backward or forward with equal ease.|$|E

2500|$|The wire in a {{voice coil}} is usually made of copper, though aluminum—and, rarely, silver—may be used. [...] The {{advantage}} of aluminum is its light weight, which reduces the moving mass compared to copper. [...] This raises the resonant frequency of the speaker and increases its efficiency. [...] A disadvantage of aluminum {{is that it is}} not easily soldered, and so connections are instead often crimped together and sealed. [...] These connections must be made well or they may fail in an intense environment of mechanical vibration. [...] Voice-coil wire cross sections can be circular, rectangular, or hexagonal, giving varying amounts of wire volume coverage in the magnetic gap space. The coil is oriented co-axially inside the gap; it moves back and forth within a small circular volume (a hole, slot, or groove) in the magnetic structure. The gap establishes a concentrated magnetic field between the two poles of a permanent magnet; the outside of the gap being one pole, and the <b>center</b> <b>post</b> (called the pole piece) being the other. The pole piece and backplate are often a single piece, called the poleplate or yoke.|$|E

[...] The [...] "Ideal Cleaners" [...] shop features a neon sign and period appointments in the Art Deco style. Many of these historic buildings are protected as official city landmarks. During a city Cultural Heritage Survey in the 1980s most of the district was designated as featuring historically significant architectural resources. The Survey was conducted {{by the city of}} Oakland's Planning Department and its Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board from 1980 to 1985. Other historic places include the Victorian Camron-Stanford house on the shore of Lake Merritt at 14th Street and Lakeside Drive, the Municipal Boathouse on Lakeside Drive, the Greek revival Scottish Rite Center on Lakeside Drive, the eleven story Bechtel Building at 244 Lakeside, the Alician apartments on Alice Street with its ornate marble entrance, the Regillus condominiums on 19th street, the mission revival Scottish Rite Temple on Madison Street, and the historic Schilling Gardens on 19th Street.|$|E
