5|$|The {{case went}} to trial in June 1982 in Philadelphia. Judge Albert F. Sabo {{initially}} agreed to Abu-Jamal's request to represent himself, with <b>criminal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> Anthony Jackson acting as his legal advisor.

Due to Abu-Jamal's continued disruptive behavior, Sabo ruled that Abu-Jamal forfeited his right to self-representation.|$|E
5|$|The defense case {{commenced}} on March 25. The third {{count of}} the indictment was quashed as duplicative with the first. Burton testified that he had accepted Rialto's employment due to personal financial reversals. Burton testified that his duties would include acting as a <b>criminal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> for Dennis, but would not include any activity in Washington. Burton testified that he received notice of his appointment from Harlan on November 20, 1902, {{and that he had}} only contacted the Post Office to notify them of his intent to defend Dennis in a criminal case. He explained that he only asked to be notified of complaints against Rialto so that he could terminate his association with them should any arise.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati as a <b>criminal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney,</b> defending several people accused of murder. In one case, {{he used a}} form of the insanity defense that saved the accused from the gallows; the woman was instead confined to a mental institution. Hayes also defended slaves who had escaped and were accused under the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, it was a destination for escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts. A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his {{work on behalf of}} fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican Party.|$|E

Tobacco heiress Doris Duke posted $5 million bail for the former First Lady. The Marcos couple's defense team was led by <b>criminal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> Gerry Spence. Actor George Hamilton, an unindicted co-conspirator, testified at trial under a grant of immunity, acknowledging that he had received a $5.5-million loan from an associate of hers.

40|$|<b>Criminal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> {{are often}} {{motivated}} by an intricate set {{of moral and}} ideological principles that belie their reputations as amoral (if not immoral) “hired guns” who {{would do anything to}} get their guilty clients off. Using empirical data from interviews with forty <b>criminal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> I explore the motivations that inform their decisions to enter the field of <b>criminal</b> <b>defense</b> and the values that influence {{the manner in which they}} do their jobs. I conclude that many <b>criminal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> are in fact cause lawyers who are committed to individual clients but also the “cause” of legal reform in criminal law. These dual commitment [...] essentially to individual clients versus the collective group of criminal defendants [...] occasionally raise ethical conflicts that have largely gone under-examined and that the rules of ethics and professionalism are not well-equipped to resolve. Although examined here through the lens of criminal defending, the ethical dilemma of cause lawyering is a noteworthy problem generally for activist lawyers because they continue to play an important role in socio-legal movements in this country...|$|R

40|$|This Essay {{considers}} the rhetoric some judges {{have used to}} characterize the respective duties of prosecutors and <b>criminal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys.</b> The Essay suggests that, although this rhetoric often expresses admirable aspirations and ideals, it improperly blurs the lines between the roles different lawyers play within the adversarial system. Specifically, these judges have used language {{that would seem to}} place additional limitations on both the methods prosecutors employ in seeking to obtain just convictions and the tactics <b>criminal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> employ in zealous advocacy of their clients’ interests. This Essay concludes that judges should avoid such rhetoric, which has the potential to undermine basic principles of the American legal system...|$|R
