5|$|The {{earliest}} records surrounding {{development of}} the Standard Schnauzer in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more <b>compact</b> <b>size</b> for ratting by combining it with the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer appeared in 1888, and the first exhibition was held in 1899.|$|E
5|$|Due to Caroline’s <b>compact</b> <b>size,</b> {{sustained}} winds only reached 48mph (78km/h) in Brownsville, Texas. The storm also dropped {{heavy rain}} the southern {{portion of the}} state, as much as 11.93in (302mm) in Port Isabel. In Brownsville, Caroline broke a record for most rainfall within a 24-hour period {{during the month of}} August. The rainfall caused minor flooding. This helped end a prolonged drought in the Rio Grande Valley. It canceled most of the Labor Day holiday season for South Padre Island, one of the busiest weekends for tourism on the island. Caroline also produced storm tides 1–4feet (0.3-1.2m) above normal along coastal sections of southern Texas. Overall damage in southern Texas was minor, and there were two indirect fatalities due to drowning incidents in Galveston.|$|E

5|$|Located {{within an}} area of weak {{vertical}} wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the depression intensified. By 06:00UTC the next morning, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Beta by the NHC. Beta was slowly moving towards the north-northwest {{in response to a}} mid-tropospheric shortwave trough over the Gulf of Mexico and mid-tropospheric ridge to the northeast of the storm. Deep convection developed near the center of circulation, signifying a developing system. With favorable conditions for development, Beta was forecast to intensify into a hurricane before making landfall in central Nicaragua. An eyewall rapidly developed around the center of circulation, fuelling further intensification. With the formation of an eyewall and the <b>compact</b> <b>size</b> of the storm, rapid intensification was anticipated. By the end of October27, maximum sustained winds around the center of Beta were estimated at 60mph (95km/h). An increase in wind shear caused a minor disruption of the storm's structure, briefly preventing strengthening.|$|E

40|$|The total star {{formation}} budget of galaxies {{consists of the}} sum of the unobscured {{star formation}}, as observed in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), together with the obscured component that is absorbed and re-radiated by dust grains in the infrared. We explore how the fraction of obscured star formation depends on stellar mass for mass-complete samples of galaxies at 0 1. For log(M/M_) > 10. 5, > 90 % of star formation is obscured at all redshifts. We also show that at fixed total SFR, f_obscured is lower at higher redshift. At fixed mass, high-redshift galaxies are observed to have more <b>compact</b> <b>sizes</b> and much higher star formation rates, gas fractions and hence surface densities (implying higher dust obscuration), yet we observe no redshift evolution in f_obscured with stellar mass. This poses a challenge to theoretical models to reproduce, where the observed <b>compact</b> <b>sizes</b> at high redshift seem in tension with lower dust obscuration.

25|$|The new Toyota FC Stack {{achieves}} a maximum output of 114kW (153hp). Electricity generation efficiency has been enhanced {{through the use}} of 3D fine mesh flow channels. These channels—a world first, according to Toyota—are arranged in a fine three-dimensional lattice structure and enhance the dispersion of air (oxygen), thereby enabling uniform generation of electricity on cell surfaces. This, in turn, provides a <b>compact</b> <b>size</b> and a high level of performance, including the stack’s world-leading power output density of 3.1kW/L (2.2 times higher than that of the previous Toyota FCHV-adv limited-lease model), or 2.0kW/kg. Each stack comprises 370 (single-line stacking) cells, with a cell thickness of 1.34mm and weight of 102 g. The compact Mirai FC stack generates about 160 times more power than the residential fuel cells on sale in Japan.
