5|$|The 6th National Congress {{elected the}} 6th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee.</b> At the 4th, 5th and 6th National Congresses {{approximately}} 45 percent of full <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> members were retained, 18 percent of alternate members were promoted to full membership and 37 percent were newly {{elected to the}} <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> as either full or alternate members. The 6th Congress continued the trend of increasing {{the size of the}} Central Committee; membership was 124 full and 49 alternate members. Most of the new officials in the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> were from the second generation of Vietnamese revolutionaries who gained prominence during Vietnam's struggle against French colonial rule in the 1940s and 1950s. The composition of the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> changed at the 6th National Congress, with a notable increase of economic specialists, technocrats and provincial secretaries as members, but military representation in the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> decreased. Only 8 percent of members of the 6th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> were from the Vietnam People's Army. The number of central-level officials also decreased; 74 percent {{of the members of the}} 2nd <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> were central-level officials, while only 46 percent in the 6th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> were from the centre. These changes reflected the party's overriding concern about basic problems.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> elects the Politburo in the {{aftermath}} of the Party Congress. Since the full <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> meets only once a year, the Politburo functions as the Party's leading collective decision-making body. The Secretariat is also elected by the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee,</b> and is headed by the General Secretary. It is responsible for solving organisational problems and implementing the demands of the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee.</b> The Secretariat oversees the work of the Commissions of the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee.</b>|$|E
5|$|The General Secretary {{presides over}} {{the work of}} the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee,</b> the Political Bureau, the Secretariat, and chairs {{meetings}} with key leaders (Working Regulation of the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee,</b> 2011).|$|E
50|$|Chen was an {{alternate}} member of 13th and 14th <b>Central</b> <b>Committees</b> of the Communist Party of China, {{and a full}} member of 15th, 16th, 17th <b>Central</b> <b>Committees.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shen was an {{alternate}} member of 15th and 16th <b>Central</b> <b>Committees</b> of the Communist Party of China, {{and was a}} full member of 17th and 18th <b>Central</b> <b>Committees.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shi was an {{alternate}} member of 14th and 15th <b>Central</b> <b>Committees</b> of Communist Party of China (1992-2002), {{and a full}} member of 16th and 17th <b>Central</b> <b>Committees</b> (2002-2012).|$|R
5|$|The {{average age}} of the Politburo's members was 58 years in 1961, and 71 in 1981. A similar greying also took place in the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee,</b> the median age rising from 53 in 1961 to 62 in 1981, with the {{proportion}} of members older than 65 increasing from 3 percent in 1961 to 39 percent in 1981. The difference in the median age between Politburo and <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> members {{can be explained by the}} fact that the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> was consistently enlarged during Brezhnev's leadership; this made it possible to appoint new and younger members to the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> without retiring some of its oldest members. Of the 319-member <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> in 1981, 130 were younger than 30 when Stalin died in 1953.|$|E
5|$|However, on 14 March, Malenkov {{resigned}} from the secretariat of the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee.</b> This came due to concerns that he was acquiring too much power. The major beneficiary was Khrushchev. His name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries—indicating that he was {{now in charge of}} the party. The <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> formally elected him First Secretary in September.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Suslov {{was made}} {{a member of the}} Orgburo, and {{immediately}} became the Head of the Foreign Policy Department of the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee.</b> Within a year, Suslov was appointed Head of the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> Department for Agitation and Propaganda. He also became a harsh critic of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee in the post-war years. In 1947 Suslov was transferred to Moscow and elected to the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> Secretariat; he would retain this seat {{for the rest of his}} life. Suslov had the full confidence of Stalin, and in 1948, he was entrusted with the task of speaking on behalf of the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> before a solemn meeting on the twenty-fourth anniversary of Vladimir Lenin's death. From September 1949 to 1950 he was editor-in-chief of the central Party daily Pravda.|$|E

5|$|In a {{proposal}} to the 11th plenum of the 9th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee,</b> Võ Văn Kiệt suggested democratizing the political system by giving the delegates to a party congress the power to elect the general secretary, the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> and the Central Commission for Inspection, and giving congress delegates ultimate power on all matters put before them at the congress. He called for {{the reduction of the}} <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> from one-fourth to one-third, holding the elections of state leaders at the National Assembly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} a congress (and not a year later), secret ballots for elections, empowering delegates to self-nominate to the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> and merging the offices of President and General Secretary into one. These suggestions, with the exception of holding the National Assembly elections earlier, were rejected at the 11th plenum of the 9th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> in January 2005.|$|E
5|$|Minister Jaruzelski became also prime {{minister}} in February 1981. In June, the Soviet <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> pressured the Polish party for a leadership change, but Jaruzelski received strong support from the military members of the Polish <b>Central</b> <b>Committee.</b> The extraordinary IX Congress of the PZPR took place in July. Kania was reelected the party's first secretary, while the organization's internal reformers suffered a defeat.|$|E
5|$|The 1st plenum of the 6th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> {{brought an}} end to the {{protracted}} generational succession which had begun at the 4th National Congress in 1976. On 17 December, the Congress' third day, the three top leadersTrường Chinh, Lê Đức Thọand head of government Phạm Văn Đồng, announced that they would not seek membership of the 6th Politburo or the 6th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee.</b> However, these three were appointed to the Advisory Council to the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee.</b> This was not new; at the 5th National Congress six senior members of the 5th Politburo retired. When asked by foreign journalists if the same pattern would continue, a party spokesman stated that it would continue at the 6th National Congress. Văn Tiến Dũng, the Minister of National Defense, retired from the politburo but retained his seat in the 6th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee.</b> The 1st plenum elected Nguyễn Văn Linh to succeed Trường Chinh as party General Secretary.|$|E

50|$|Under the 1924 Soviet Constitution, the <b>Central</b> Executive <b>Committee</b> {{was made}} up of two chambers: the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities. Beside it there were <b>Central</b> Executive <b>Committees</b> in federal republics, such as the All-Russian <b>Central</b> Executive <b>Committee</b> in RSFSR, Belorussian <b>Central</b> Executive <b>Committee</b> in BSSR, the All-Ukrainian <b>Central</b> Executive <b>Committee</b> in the Ukrainian SSR, and the <b>Central</b> Executive <b>Committee</b> of the Transacaucasian SSR.|$|R
50|$|Syrtsov {{was moved}} in 1924 to the {{position}} of chief of the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee's</b> Agitation and Propaganda department, later becoming a member of the Presidium of the Communist Academy and editor of the VKP(b) <b>Central</b> <b>Committee's</b> magazine, Communist Revolution.|$|R
5|$|The National Congress is the party's highest organ. The {{direction}} of the Party and the Government is decided at the National Congress, held every fifth year. The <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> is elected by the National Congress. Delegates vote on policies and candidates posts within the central party leadership. Following ratification of the decisions taken at the National Congress, the National Congress dissolves itself. The <b>Central</b> <b>Committee,</b> which is elected by the National Congress every fifth year, implements {{the decisions of the}} National Congress in the five-year period. Since the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> only meets twice a year, the Politburo implements the policies of the National Congress.|$|E
5|$|The elected 10th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> {{comprised}} 81 (52.5 percent) {{members from}} the 9th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee,</b> and 79 (47.5 percent) new members were elected. The candidate with the highest vote received 97.88 percent, while the candidate with the lowest vote received 63.41 percent. All the provinces, {{with the exception of}} Đắk Nông Province, elected officials to the 10th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee.</b> A number of surprises occurred during the election process; six ministers were not re-elected. Another surprise was that no officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were elected as full members. However, Phạm Bình Minh, the Director of the International Organizations Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was elected as an alternate member. None of the 34 self-nominated candidates at the congress were elected to the 10th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee.</b> It is unknown whether any of the self-nominees for alternate membership in the 10th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> were elected. There was an increase in <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> officials working in the central government, the provinces, military and defence officials, public security officials and officials from mass organizations, but there was a decrease in officials from the sectors of information, social and cultural affairs, economics, business and financial affairs, and others.|$|E

5|$|In 1918, Molotov {{was sent}} to Ukraine {{to take part in}} the civil war then {{breaking}} out. Since he was not a military man, he took no part in the fighting. In 1920, he became secretary to the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Ukrainian Bolshevik Party. Lenin recalled him to Moscow in 1921, elevating him to full membership of the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> and Orgburo, and putting him in charge of the party secretariat. He was voted in as a non-voting member of the Politburo in 1921, and held the office of Responsible Secretary and also married Soviet politician Polina Zhemchuzhina.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Han {{became a}} member of the first <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Workers' Party of North Korea. He {{maintained}} the post in the party and its successor, the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Workers' Party of Korea, until 1969. Han became the minister of education in May 1956 and retained his post as the chairman of the Writers' Union. During his ministerial career, Han initiated a campaign to diminish the importance of Russian language teaching in North Korean colleges in the spring of 1956. He also started to enlist writers with a proletarian background.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Khrushchev divided oblast (province) level Party {{committees}} {{into two}} parallel structures, one for industry {{and one for}} agriculture. This was unpopular among Party apparatchiks, and led to confusions {{in the chain of}} command, as neither committee secretary had precedence over the other. As there were limited numbers of <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> seats from each oblast, the division set up the possibility of rivalry for office between factions, and, according to Medvedev, had the potential for beginning a two-party system. Khrushchev also ordered that one-third of the membership of each committee, from low-level councils to the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> itself, be replaced at each election. This decree created tension between Khrushchev and the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> and upset the party leaders upon whose support Khrushchev had risen to power.|$|E

5|$|In practice, {{the delegates}} rarely discuss issues at length at the National Congresses. Most {{substantive}} discussion takes {{place before the}} congress, in the preparation period, {{among a group of}} top party leaders. In between National Congresses, the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> is the highest decision-making institution. The CCDI is responsible for supervising party's internal anti-corruption and ethics system. In between congresses the CCDI is under the authority of the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lê Duẩn's {{report to}} the 5th National Congress was a biting self-criticism of his {{leadership}} and the party's management. He criticised political and economic corruption and the gerontocracy itself. The 5th <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> contained only one member under 60. During this period the <b>Central</b> <b>Committee</b> was disrupted by factional infighting between pragmatists and conservatives. This struggle would lead to economic reform. Lê Duẩn and his supporters began the effort to open the economy.|$|E
