Three different patterns of hepatitis B endemicity (high, intermediate and low) with well-defined geographic distribution have been recognized (3). The prevalence of HBV infection is especially high in South-East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Western Pacific where more than 8 % of the population are chronic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. In areas with this pattern perinatal transmission or transmission during early childhood are responsible for the high rate of chronic HBV infection.

SETTING [...] A department of infectious diseases in Copenhagen, seeing about half the patients with AIDS in Denmark. SUBJECTS [...] 73 HIV antibody negative subjects and 60 antibody positive subjects admitted as inpatients during the transmission period of the outbreak (20 June- 14 August), of whom 18 (17 with AIDS, one with AIDS related complex), developed cryptosporidiosis. Two further HIV negative subjects (one departmental secretary, one visiting relative) developed cryptosporidiosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Cryptosporidia in stool samples, clinical symptoms, CD 4 cell count, HIV antigen concentration, chemotherapeutic treatment. RESULTS [...] The {{source of the outbreak}} was identified as ice from an ice machine in the ward, contaminated by an incontinent, psychotic patient with cryptosporidiosis picking out ice for cold drinks.

40|$|The Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) affects {{mainly to}} the liver, infecting the hepatocytes, {{and it can be}} either acute or chronic. Globally, it is {{estimated}} that 2 billion of people are infected with HBV and 350 - 400 million people suffer chronic infection. Furthermore, more than 600. 000 HBV <b>carriers</b> <b>die</b> every year from end-stage liver diseases including fulminant hepatitis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) caused by HBV infection and hence it represents a major global health problem. HBV prevalence is higher in low-income countries including Africa, the middleeast and Asia than in western world, where horizontal transmission of HBV is the most common route. Conversely, in western countries, sexual and parenteral (intravenous drug used) are the main routes of transmission. Furthermore, as HBV shares the routes of infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), co-infection is relatively frequent. Among 36 million people living with HIV worldwide and approximately 4 million people (~ 10 %) are chronically co-infected with HBV. Similarly, the prevalence of this coinfection is higher in Africa and Asia (up to 20 % in some regions) than in western countries (< 10 %). HBV is characterized by an extraordinary genetic variability mainly due to its reverse transcriptase, which lacks of proof-reading activity producing a high mutation rate. The high genetic variability allows HBV the ability to develop drug resistance mutations to evade pharmacological pressure. Additionally to Interferon α, there are 5 nucleoside/nucleotide analogues approved for HBV treatment (lamivudine, telvibudine, entecavir, adefovir, and tenofovir). Nowadays, tenofovir (TDF) {{is one of the most}} widely nucleotide analogue used for the treatment of HBV infection, which is also active against HIV and is commonly used in western countries for the treatment of HIV/HBV co-infected patients due to its high antiviral efficacy and high genetic barrier for resistance. However, in low-income countries, the use of this drug is still restricted because its high cost and lamivudine (3 TC) is still the most nucleoside analogue used against HBV infection included within the HIV antiretroviral therapy because is cheaper and also active against HIV. As consequence of this regimen, HBV drug resistance is expected among these patients since the long-term exposure to 3 TC monotherapies is associated with high rates of HBV drug resistance in both HBV monoinfected and HIV/HBV co-infected patients. HIV/HBV co-infected patients show higher HBV DNA levels and lower serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels than those infected with HBV alone. Moreover, liver fibrosis tends to be more advance and the risk of end-stage liver disease is increased. Nevertheless, there is scarce information regarding how HIV could drive the HBV genetic evolution. In this thesis, two HIV/HBV co-infected cohorts under 3 TCbased treatment have been studied from two different endemic countries, Ghana and Malawi. The genetic variability within the genes that encodes the polymerase and the Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) was assessed. The Ghana cohort was under longterm treatment and three clinically different cohorts were evaluated at genetic level to evaluate how HIV drives HBV evolution (HIV/HBsAg positive, HIV/HBsAg negative and HBV monoinfected). In Malawi, the rates and predictors of virological responses in HIV/HBV co-infected patients under 3 TC-based regimens were evaluated after 48 weeks of 3 TC-based therapy. Additionally, the genetic evolution of both polymerase and HBsAg were also assessed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Infants born to {{hepatitis}} B {{surface antigen}} (HBsAg) -positive mothers {{are exposed to}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) at birth and do not receive proper post-exposure prophylaxis. Approximately 90 % of infants who acquire HBV infection at birth go on to become chronic carriers. An estimated 15 - 25 % of these <b>carriers</b> ultimately will <b>die</b> of liver failure secondary to chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or primary hepatocellular carcinoma. On the other hand, 90 % of perinatal HBV infections can be prevented by post-exposure prophylaxis given within 12 hours of birth. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection among pregnant women in fianl›urfa; to screen their newborns for vertical transmission; and to prevent neonatal infection by vaccination. Materials and Methods: Blood samples from 1162 pregnant women paying their first antenatal visit to Harran University Research Hospital Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic between June 1998 and June 2002 were screened for HBsAg, hepatitis B infectivity antigen (HBeAg) and anti-HBs by ELISA.

40|$|Abstract Brugada {{syndrome}} is an inherited arrhythmia disorder that predisposes to sudden cardiac death. It {{is characterized by}} its distinct ECG pattern. The purpose of this thesis was to study the phenotype and genotype characteristics of subjects with Brugada syndrome type ECG. The first study population consisted of 2479 young male Air Force applicants and 542 healthy middle-aged subjects. The 12 -lead ECG was analyzed to assess the prevalence and prognosis of Brugada pattern in Finnish population. The second population consisted of 168 patients with AF. The ECGs of the patients with family history of lone AF were analysed in order to characterize the ECG features of familial AF. The third population consisted of 200 patients with Brugada syndrome and their ECGs were analyzed for detection of distinct ECG characteristics. In a substudy, the H 558 R variant was genotyped and the clinical presentation of this variant was evaluated. The clinical characteristics were collected of 47 patients with induced Brugada ECG during fever or medication. The prevalence of type 2 or 3 Brugada ECG was 0. 61 % in the young population and 0. 55 % in the middle-aged Finnish population. In a retrospective analysis, none of the Brugada ECG <b>carriers</b> had <b>died.</b> In the AF study, the prevalence of type 2 or 3 Brugada ECG was significantly higher among the subjects with lone AF compared to the healthy controls (p   30 % of first-degree relatives) of AF. In patients with Brugada syndrome, the prolonged QRS duration was associated with previous symptoms. The R allele carriers in H 558 R variant had a trend towards less symptoms (p =  0. 067) and had less conduction disturbances in 12 -lead ECG than the HH genotype carriers (p <  0. 05 in all ECG analysis). Among the subjects with induced Brugada ECG, 51 % exhibited arrhythmic symptoms during the medical condition that had provoked the ECG pattern. In conclusion, type 2 and 3 Brugada ECGs {{were found to be}} benign in the Finnish population since no mortality occurred during an extensive follow-up period. On the other hand, these ECG abnormalities seem to be a marker of familial AF. Among patients with the Brugada syndrome, a prolongation of QRS is associated with prior symptoms. The variant H 558 R R allele seems to be a protecting genetic modulator. Induced Brugada ECG is a medical emergency since the patients are at high risk of sudden cardiac death...|$|R

40|$|Preexistent {{feline leukemia virus}} (FeLV) {{infection}} greatly potentiated {{the severity}} of the transient primary and chronic secondary stages of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection. Of 10 FeLV-FIV <b>carrier</b> cats, 5 <b>died</b> of experimentally induced FIV infection, compared with 2 deaths in 10 cats infected only with FeLV and 1 death in 7 cats infected only with FIV. FIV-infected cats with preexistent FeLV infections developed severe depression, anorexia, fever, diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, and leukopenia 4 to 6 weeks after infection and were moribund within 2 weeks of the onset of signs, whereas cats infected only with FIV developed much milder self-limiting gross and hematologic abnormalities. Pathologic findings in dually infected cats that died were similar to those observed previously in cats dying from uncomplicated primary FIV infection but were much more widespread and severe. Coinfection of asymptomatic FeLV carrier cats with FIV did not increase the levels of FeLV p 27 antigen present in their blood over that seen in cats infected with FeLV alone. The amount of proviral FIV DNA was much higher, however, in dually infected cats than in cats infected only with FIV; there was a greater expression of FIV DNA in lymphoid tissues, where the genome was normally detected, and in nonlymphoid tissues, where FIV DNA was not usually found. Dually infedted cats that recovered from the primary stage of FIV infection remained more leukopenic than cats infected with FIV or FeLV alone, and their CD 4 +/CD 8 + T-lymphocyte ratios were inverted. One of these cats developed what was considered to be an opportunistic infection. It was concluded, therefore, that a preexistent FeLV infection in some way enhanced the expression and spread of FIV in the body and increased the severity of both the resulting transient primary and chronic secondary stages of FIV infection. This study also demonstrated the usefulness of the FIV model in studying the role of incidental infectious diseases as cofactors for immunodeficiency-causing lentiviruses...|$|R
40|$|Aufgrund seiner potentiell gesundheitsfoerdernden Wirkung wurde das Falvonol Quercetin in den letzten Jahren intensiv untersucht. Daten zur Bioverfuegbarkeit nach oraler Applikation sind jedoch selten und widerspruechlich. Fruehere Untersuchungen deuteten darauf hin, dass die Disposition von Quercetin von der Zuckerkomponente des Glykosids oder der Pflanzenmatrix abhaengen koennte. Um den Einfluss der Zuckerkomponente oder der Matrix auf die Resorption von Quercetin festzustellen, wurden zwei isolierte Quercetinglykoside sowie zwei Pflanzenextrakte in einer vierarmigen, randomisierten {{cross-over}} Studie an 12 gesunden Probanden getestet. Jeder Proband erhielt eine Zwiebelzubereitung oder Quercetin- 4 '-O-glucosid, jeweils entsprechend 100 mg Quercetinaglykon, sowie Quercetin- 3 -O-rutinosid oder Buchweizenkrauttee entsprechend 200 mg Quercetinaglykon. Die Proben wurden mittels HPLC und Coulometrischer Arraydetektion analysiert. Im Plasma wurden ausschliesslich Quercetinglucuronide detektiert. Freies Quercetin und die Glykoside waren nicht nachweisbar. Die Bioverfuegbarkeit und Pharmakokinetik nach Applikation von Zwiebeln und Quercetin- 4 '-glucosid zeigte keine signifikanten Unterschiede. Maximale Plasmakonzentrationen von 2. 3 ± 1. 5 µg·mL- 1 and 2. 1 ± 1. 6 µg·mL- 1 (MW±SD) wurden nach 0. 7 ± 0. 2 h und 0. 7 ± 0. 3 h erreicht. Nach Einnahme von Buchweizenkraut und Rutin wurden maximale Plasmakonzentrationen (trotz der doppelten Dosis) von nur 0. 6 ± 0. 7 µg·mL- 1 und 0. 3 ± 0. 3 µg·mL- 1 nach 4. 3 ± 1. 8 h bzw. 7. 0 ± 2. 9 h erreicht. Die terminale Halbwertszeit lag bei ca. 11 h fuer alle vier Pruefpraeparate. Die Disposition von Quercetin ist daher primaer von der Zuckerkomponente abhaengig. Zu einem geringern Anteil beeinflusst die Pflanzenmatrix im Falle von Buchweizenkrauttee sowohl Geschwindigkeit als auch Ausmass der Resorption. Der Resorptionsort scheint fuer Quercetin- 4 ‘-O-glucoside und Quercetin- 3 -O-rutinoside unterschiedlich zu sein. <b>Die</b> bedeutung spezifischer <b>carrier</b> fuer <b>die</b> Resorption von Quercetinglykosiden sowie von intestinalen ß-Glucosidasen muss in weiteren Untersuchungen geklaert werden. Due to its potentially beneficial {{impact on}} human health the polyphenol quercetin has come into the focus of medicinal interest. However, data on the bioavailability of quercetin after oral intake are scarce and contradictory. Previous investigations indicate that the disposition of quercetin may depend on the sugar moiety of the glycoside or the plant matrix. In {{order to determine the}} influence of the sugar moiety or matrix on the absorption of quercetin, two isolated quercetin glycosides and two plant extracts were administered to 12 healthy volunteers in a four-way cross-over study. Each subject received an onion supplement or quercetin- 4 ‘-O-glucoside both equivalent to 100 mg quercetin, as well as quercetin- 3 -O-rutinoside and buckwheat tea both equivalent to 200 mg quercetin. Samples were analyzed by HPLC with a 12 -channel coulometric array detector. In human plasma only quercetin glucuronides, but no free quercetin, could be detected. There {{was no significant difference in}} the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic parameters between the onion supplement and quercetin- 4 ‘-O-glucoside. Peak plasma concentrations were 2. 3 ± 1. 5 µg·mL- 1 and 2. 1 ± 1. 6 µg·mL- 1 (mean±SD) and were reached after 0. 7 ± 0. 2 h and 0. 7 ± 0. 3 h, respectively. After administration of buckwheat tea and rutin, however, peak plasma levels were (despite the higher dose) only 0. 6 ± 0. 7 µg·mL- 1 and 0. 3 ± 0. 3 µg·mL- 1, respectively. Peak concentrations were reached 4. 3 ± 1. 8 h after administration of buckwheat tea and 7. 0 ± 2. 9 h after ingestion of rutin. The terminal elimination half life was about 11 h for all treatments. Thus, the disposition of quercetin in humans is primarily depending on the sugar moiety. To a minor extent, the plant matrix influences both rate and extent of absorption in the case of buckwheat tea administration compared to the isolated compound. The site of absorption seems to be different for quercetin- 4 ‘-O-glucoside and quercetin- 3 -O-rutinoside. The significance of specific carriers on the absorption of quercetin glycosides as well as specific intestinal ß-glucosidases needs to be further evaluated...|$|R
