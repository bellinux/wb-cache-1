30|$|In our calculations, the {{following}} assumptions were used. (1) Products {{are always in}} a chemical equilibrium. (2) Vapor plumes cool adiabatically. Thus, the temperature and pressure of the vapor plumes change along isentropic paths, whose entropies are determined by laser ablation. The <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> is estimated along those pressure-temperature paths. (3) The <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> is determined by a single quenching; all reactions quench at one quenching temperature. Quenching temperature is the temperature where chemical reaction rate and cooling rate of vapor plume become the same. Since the cooling rate of vapor plumes decreases as the scale of a vapor plume increases, quenching temperature decreases as the scale of a vapor plume increases. In general, quenching temperature of reactions within vapor plumes of LPV experiments (i.e., millimeter-scale vapor plumes) {{is estimated to be}} ~ 3000 K and that of vapor plumes produced by impactors several kilometers in diameter is ~ 2000 K (e.g., Gerasimov et al., 1998). In our calculation, the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> is determined as a function of quenching temperature.|$|R
