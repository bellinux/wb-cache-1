40|$|On {{a global}} basis rotaviruses {{are the most}} {{important}} agents involved in childhood diarrhea. In developing countries they account for 6 % of all diarrheas and 20 % of all diarrhea related deaths of children under 5 years of age, with over 1 billion episodes and over 4 million deaths annually. Given the disease burden, {{there is a need for}} better understanding the risk factors involved in rotavirus disease, to identify areas of intervention. In order to provide this information, two areas were developed: a review of the literature, examining the causal evidence for rotavirus diarrhea and a <b>case</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>study.</b> The <b>case</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>study</b> analyzed two areas: identifying climate factors and, identifying environmental and behavioral risk factors. The literature review showed that few analytical studies have identified specific risk factors such as home environment, and a winter seasonal trend for temperate areas, but in key areas evidence is contradictory. The <b>case</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>study</b> for climate factors demonstrated that seasonality occurs in a tropical country like Venezuela and that a complex interplay between weather conditions contribute to the seasonal pattern. A positive association between rain fall (OR 4. 1); dew point (OR 2. 3) and temperature differential during the day (OR 1. 4) and, an inverse association with temperature (OR 0. 5) and relative humidity (OR 0. 8) was found. This information is useful in understanding the seasonal pattern of rotavirus and for planning health care needs. The second analysis demonstrated that environmental variables such as crowding (OR 14. 3), contact with someone with an infectious disease (OR 4. 9) and animal ownership (OR 2. 3) were important. Restricting the analysis to animal owners demonstrated that living In a rural settling (OR 13. 8), defecating in inappropriate places (OR 7. 2), crowding(4. 2) and indoor animals (4. 0) are of importance. Behavioral variables identified were: lack of breast feeding (OR 4. 0) and visiting when someone was sick (OR 3. 4). Biological and demographic variables of importance were: age, with a dose response relationship; undernurishment (OR 11. 3) and household per capita monthly income less than US $ 16. 30 (OR 8. 5). Using a diarrhea compeer group we found that, although some of the previous variables were of importance, no major differences were found. These findings are important in identifying paths for prevention and further research. ...|$|E

This is a retrospective <b>case</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>study.</b> Three groups of children were identified, assessed, matched for age, and partially matched for gender. Children clinically referred to residential treatment with a history of abuse (N = 29) were compared with children clinically referred to residential treatment without a history of abuse (N = 29), and a nonclinical group of children residing in the community (N = 29). Variables investigating specific types of aggression, IQ, and psychopathology were assessed across the three groups. Clinically referred children scored worse on all measures compared with nonclinical community children. Clinically referred abused children scored higher on measures of aggression and significantly higher on measures of reactive aggression and verbal aggression than clinically referred nonabused children. Clinically referred abused children had significantly lower verbal IQ scores than clinically referred nonabused children, but no difference in psychopathology.

Twenty five patients with schizophrenia, 26 patients with other psychiatric disorders, and 38 normal controls were studied. Alveolar breath samples were collected from all participants, and volatile organic compounds in the breath were assayed by gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy. Differences in the distribution of volatile organic compounds between the three groups were compared by computerised pattern recognition analysis. RESULTS [...] Forty eight different volatile organic compounds were observed in the breath samples. Three separate pattern recognition methods indicated an increased differentiation capability between the patients with schizophrenia and the other subjects. Pattern recognition category classification models using 11 of these volatile organic compounds identified the patients with schizophrenia with a sensitivity of 80. 0 % and a specificity of 61. 9 %. Volatile organic compounds in breath were not significantly affected by drug therapy, age, sex, smoking, diet, or race.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that imbalance in patients with a severe deformity of the spine is associated with an increase in the sensory integration disorder. This paper is a <b>case</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>study.</b> Patients were divided into three groups: able-bodied (n =  53), observation (n =  23), and pre-brace (n =  26) groups. Time domain parameters (sway area, position and displacement) and structural posturographic parameters [mean distance (MD) and mean peak (MP) ] were calculated from the COP excursion using a force platform. A sensory integration disorder could be an important factor in the progression of the scoliotic curve. Significant differences were found in time domain between observation, pre-brace and able-bodied groups. The results for the structural posturographic parameters showed significant differences between the pre-brace and the able-bodied groups (P =  0. 018 MD and P =  0. 02 MP) demonstrating a perturbation in sensory integration system by an increase of imbalance. The absence of statistical difference between the observation and the pre-brace groups for the structural posturographic parameters indicates a perturbation of sensory integration system associated with curve progression. Our study has demonstrated that the pre-brace group is less stable than the able-bodied group.

40|$|Introduction. Distant {{metastasis}} {{remains the}} leading cause of death among prostate cancer patients. Several genetic susceptibility loci associated with Prostate cancer have been identified by the Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). To date, few studies have explored the ability of these SNPs to identify metastatic prostate cancer. Based on the identification of genetic variants as predictors of aggressive disease, a <b>case</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>study</b> of prostate cancer patients was designed to explore the association of 96 GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with metastatic disease. ^ Method. 1242 histologically confirmed prostate cancer patients, with and without metastatic disease, were enrolled into the study. Data were collected from personal interviews, hospital database and abstraction of medical records. Ninety six SNPs identified from GWAS studies based on their associations with prostate cancer risk were genotyped in the study population. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore the relationships of the variants with metastatic prostate cancer in Whites and African American men. ^ Results. Four SNPs showed independent associations with metastatic prostate cancer (rs 721048 in EHBP 1 (2 p 15), rs 3025039 in VEGF (6 p 12), rs 11228565 in Intergenic(11 q 13. 2) and rs 2735839 in KLK 3 (19 q 13. 33)) in the White population. For SNP rs 2735839 in KLK 3, genotype GA was 1. 71 times as likely to be associated with metastatic prostate cancer diagnosis as genotype AA after adjusting for other significant SNPs and covariates (95...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Impairment {{of upper}} limb {{function}} following stroke {{is more common}} than lower limb impairment and is also more resistant to treatment. Several lab-based studies with stroke patients have produced statistically significant gains in upper limb function when using musical instrument playing and techniques where rhythm acts as an external time-keeper for the priming and timing of upper limb movements. METHODS: For this feasibility study a small sample size of 14 participants (3 - 60 months post stroke) has been determined through clinical discussion between the researcher and study host {{in order to test}} for management, feasibility and effects, before planning a larger trial determined through power analysis. A cross-over design with five repeated measures will be used, whereby participants will be randomized into either a treatment (n = 7) or wait list control (n = 7) group. Intervention will take place twice weekly over 6 weeks. The ARAT and 9 HPT will be used to measure for quantitative gains in arm function and finger dexterity, pre/post treatment interviews will serve to investigate treatment compliance and tolerance. A lab based EEG <b>case</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>study</b> will be undertaken to explore audio-motor coupling, brain connectivity and neural reorganization with this intervention, as evidenced in similar studies. DISCUSSION: Before evaluating the effectiveness of a home-based intervention in a larger scale study, it is important to assess whether implementation of the trial methodology is feasible. This study investigates the feasibility, efficacy and patient experience of a music therapy treatment protocol comprising a chart of 12 different instrumental exercises and variations, which aims at promoting measurable changes in upper limb function in hemiparetic stroke patients. The study proposes to examine several new aspects including home-based treatment and dosage, and will provide data on recruitment, adherence and variability of outcomes...|$|E
40|$|A <b>case</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>study</b> of 159 {{women was}} {{conducted}} to test the hypotheses that women with cervical dysplasia had a higher prevalence of low dietary intakes of carotenoids, vitamin C, and folacin than women without cervical dysplasia, and {{that there would be}} no association between the risk of having cervical dysplasia and dietary intake of retinol. Information regarding the prevalence of known risk factors for cervical dysplasia, early age at first intercourse, multiple sexual partners, early age at first pregnancy, history of having sexually transmitted diseases, cigarette smoking, and sociodemographic data was collected. Dietary intake was estimated using a 97 item quantified food frequency questionnaire designed to obtain information on consumption of all sources of retinol, carotenoids, vitamin C and folacin. Univariate analyses showed that the presence of cervical dysplasia was positively and significantly associated with all the risk factors. In analyses of the association of the dietary variables with cervical dysplasia, information on carotenoid intake was calculated in two ways, as total carotenoid intake and as intake of lycopene and other carotenoids. While there appeared to be an inverse association between the presence of cervical dysplasia and intakes of lycopene and folacin, lower intake of retinol, total carotenoids, other carotenoids (non-lycopene carotenoids) or vitamin C did not increase the risk of having cervical dysplasia. Multivariable analyses showed that, in comparison to women who usually consume 105 RE/day of lycopene, the odds of having cervical dysplasia for women who consume 31 - 104 RE/day and 30 RE/day or less were 1. 31 and 1. 66 respectively. The odds of having cervical dysplasia in women who consume 199 - 396 mcg/day and 198 mcg/day or less of folacin were 2. 66 and 2. 97 respectively as compared to women who usually consume 397 mcg/day or more. These results suggest the importance of re-evaluating existing dietary data and planning in future studies to evaluate the associations of lycopene and folacin with cervical cancer, as well as to extend these results to other diet/cancer investigations. ...|$|E
30|$|In {{the recent}} past, machine {{learning}} approaches for NILM have attracted {{a lot of attention}} due to breakthroughs in research disciplines such as computer vision. The authors of (Kelly & Knottenbelt, 2015) are the first to evaluate the application of deep neural networks for energy disaggregation. Three deep neural network architectures are adapted for energy disaggregation. Experiments are performed against unseen household consumption data and against data seen during training. In the presented case study, the deep neural networks achieved better F 1 scores than two reference models and that all three networks achieve acceptable performance when applied to an unseen house (Kelly & Knottenbelt, 2015). The authors point out that there are many open issues such as overfitting or unsupervised pre-training. A feasibility study on the development of a generic disaggregation model is presented in (Barsim & Yang, 2018). The authors demonstrate that their generic deep disaggregation model is able to achieve similar performance as state-of-the-art load monitoring approaches for a selection of appliance types.

We sought to compare the risk of infection and the rate of malfunction of re - used pacemakers and ICDs with new devices at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods: This was a retrospective <b>case</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>study</b> of performance of re - used pacemakers and ICDs in comparison with new devices at Groote Schuur hospital over a 10 year period. The outcomes were incidence of device infection, device malfunction, early battery depletion, and device removal due to infection, malfunction, or early battery depletion. Results: Data for 126 devices implanted in 126 patients between 2003 and 2013 were analysed, of which 102 (81 %) were pacemakers (51 re - used and 51 new) and 24 (19 %) were ICDs (12 re - used and 12 new). There was no device infection, malfunction, early battery depletion or device removal in either the re - used or new pacemaker groups ov er the median follow up of 15. 1 months (interquartile range (IQR), 1. 3 - 36. 24 months) for re - used pacemakers and 55. 8 months (IQR, 20. 3 - 77. 8 months) for new pacemakers. In the ICD group, no device infection occurred over a median follow up of 35. 9 months (I QR, 17. 0 - 70. 9 months) for re - used ICDs and 45. 7 months (IQR, 37. 6 - 53. 7 months) for new ICDs.

40|$|Purpose: Joint hypermobility {{syndrome}} (JHS) is a multisystem {{connective tissue}} disorder. Pain enhancement, chronic pain, dislocations, and soft tissue rheumatism {{are some of}} the symptoms associated with this common but largely unrecognised condition (Grahame and Hakim 2006). It has been suggested that some patients with JHS show poor coordination and movement patterns which contribute to biomechanical dysfunction and chronic pain (Clark et al 2009). Pain and coordination difficulties have been observed in children with JHS (Adib et al 2005) and there are similarities in the functional difficulties reported by children with either a diagnosis of JHS or developmental coordination disorder (DCD) (Kirby and Davies 2006). Symptoms of DCD include poor proprioception, motor planning, visual spatial awareness and the retention of primitive reflexes which impact on activities of daily living. Motor impairments associated with DCD are known to persist into adulthood, and may continue to significantly affect the lives of adults with the condition (Cousin and Smyth 2003). The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the association of JHS and DCD and report on the prevalence of spinal pain. Relevance: Adults with JHS frequently report accessing a range of health professionals throughout their lives. Multiple joint instabilities, soft tissue injuries and chronic spinal pain are thought to contribute to de-conditioning and the continuing cycle of pain and poor biomechanics. It is suggested that impaired motor control may not be just as a result of pain, but related to inherent coordination difficulties linked to DCD. Participants: Participants (aged 18 - 65 years) included 90 with JHS recruited from a hypermobility clinic and 113 healthy volunteers with no pain recruited from a university setting. Methods: <b>Case</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>study</b> in which the two study groups were compared using responses from questionnaires.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{etiology}} of colorectal adenomatous polyps, although they are generally considered to be precursor lesions to colorectal carcinoma. To investigate the associations of colorectal adenomatous polyps with dietary intake of calcium, total fat and fiber, a <b>case</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>study</b> was conducted among 98 persons who had first occurrences of adenomatous polyps and 408 persons who did not have colorectal polyps. ^ The study population comprised Black, White and Hispanic males and females ages 35 to 80 inclusive, who underwent a sigmoidoscopy or total colonoscopy at collaborating clinics in the Texas Medical Center at Houston between September 1991 and November 1992, and met the eligibility criteria. Case participants were those who had a first-time diagnosis of adenomatous polyps. Comparison participants were individuals who underwent the same diagnostic procedure as the cases and met the same eligibility criteria but had no colorectal polyps. A food frequency questionnaire was administered by interview to obtain information about diet during the 28 days preceding the interview. ^ Dietary intake of total fiber was inversely associated with risk of adenomatous polyps. An increment of 15 gm/day in energy-adjusted intake of fiber was associated with a relative odds of 0. 39 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 20 to 0. 79, after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, cigarette smoking, family history of colorectal cancer and intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. No association between dietary intake of total fat and risk of adenomatous polyps was observed. When total fat was analyzed as percent of energy, an increment of 15. 3 % in intake was associated with a relative odds of 0. 98 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 53 to 1. 80. However, few persons in the study group had intakes below 25 % of energy from total fat. An inverse association was observed between energy-adjusted intake of dietary calcium and risk of adenomatous polyps, but this was not statistically significant; an increment of 638 mg/day was associated with a relative odds of 0. 77 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 41 to 1. 38. Intake of calcium did not appear to strongly modify the association between intake of fat and risk of adenomatous polyps, perhaps because the study group included few people with calcium intake below 400 mg/day. ^ These results support the idea that dietary fiber decreases risk of adenomatous polyps. Further studies are needed on the association of dietary calcium and fat with risk of colorectal adenomatous polyps in populations where individuals vary widely in intake of these nutrients. ...|$|E

The two groups matched tumor number and tumor size, and all the patients {{in the two groups}} displayed no tumor rupture, major vascular involvement and distant metastasis. Their demographics, preoperative assessment, disease recurrence patterns, overall survival and disease-free survival were compared. RESULTS: In the combination group, the median age was 65 years (range, 34 - 77 years), the median tumor number was 3 (range, 2 - 9), and the median tumor size was 6 cm (range, 1. 2 - 14 cm). In the resection group, the median age was 51. 5 years (range, 27 - 80 years, P = 0. 003), the median tumor number was 3 (range, 2 - 9, P = 0. 574), and the median tumor size was 6 cm (range, 1 - 14 cm, P = 0. 782). The two groups were similar in characteristics of tumors and comorbidities, and had comparable results in preoperative liver function tests. All patients had Child-Pugh class A status. Bilobar involvement occurred in 14 patients (73. 6 %) in the combination group and 3 patients (5. 5 %) in the resection group (P = 0. 04). Six patients (32 %) in the combination group and 35 patients (65 %) in the resection group underwent major hepatectomy. Thirteen patients (68 %) in the combination group and 19 patients (35 %) in the resection group underwent minor hepatectomy (P = 0. 012). The combination group had fewer major resections (32 % vs 65 %, P = 0. 012), less blood loss (400 vs 657 mL, P = 0. 007), shorter operation time (270 vs 400 min, P = 0. 001), and shorter hospital stay (7 vs 8. 5 d, P = 0. 042). The two groups displayed no major differences in surgical complications (15. 8 % vs 31. 5 %, P = 0. 24), disease recurrence (63. 2 % vs 50 %, P = 0. 673), hospital mortality (5. 3 % vs 5. 6 %, P = 1), and overall survival (53 vs 44. 5 mo, P = 0. 496). CONCLUSION: Safe and effective for selected patients with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma, the combination of resection and intraoperative RFA widens the applicability of surgical intervention for the disease. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{relationship is}} {{one factor that}} makes consistent contribution to outcome independent of type of therapy. The emotional exchange between persons is {{a vital part of}} any relationship, and psychotherapists’ feelings are an inescapable aspect of every session. The overall aim in this dissertation was to investigate a significant domain within the therapists’ countertransference, that is, the feelings the therapists became aware of, acknowledged, remembered, and were willing to report on a feeling word checklist (FWC- 58) after each session. Data from the First Experimental Study of Transference (FEST), a randomized clinical trial with dismantling design, was used. FEST aimed at studying the effects of a core ingredient in dynamic psychotherapy; transference work. Transference work was defined as therapist interventions focusing on the patient-therapist interaction. Hundred patients were randomized to therapy with or without transference work for one year. Long-term effects of transference work in the context of parental CT (composed of the feeling words: Motherly, Affectionate, Dominating and Important), and patients’ level of personality pathology were investigated. The results showed that both parental CT and the patients’ personality pathology strongly influenced the long-term effect of transference work: In the context of increasing parental CT the positive effect of transference work became even more positive for patients with high level of personality pathology. For patients with low levels of personality pathology the positive effect of transference work became negative. In-depth qualitative and quantitative analyses of two cases complemented the statistical analyses. These studies add to the literature which suggests that patient characteristics, technique variables, and therapist variables interact in complex ways to determine psychotherapy outcome. More specifically, the results are consistent with theory and research that emphasizes the therapists’ need to be actively aware of their countertransference. In addition, patients with high levels of personality pathology might need an emotionally involved therapist. List of papers. The papers are removed from the thesis due to publisher restrictions.
