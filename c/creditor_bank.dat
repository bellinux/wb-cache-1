40|$|In {{cases where}} a bank lends {{a huge amount}} of funds to a company, the bank is exposed to the higher risk of {{suffering}} serious financial loss in the event of the company's bankruptcy. Therefore, if the company actually faces serious financial distress, forcing it to enter into bankruptcy proceedings would put the bank itself in a financial crisis. Under the threat of suffering serious financial loss, bank managers are often reluctant to commence bankruptcy proceedings on these borrowers and to realize huge losses on their own banks' balance sheets. Instead, banks try to avoid explicit bankruptcy proceedings and keep these failing companies alive through various kinds of financial relief; for instance, providing forbearance loans and/or reducing debt burdens through a private workout proceeding to an extent insufficient to lead to the successful reorganization of the debtor but enough to help keep the debtor afloat for the time being. These practices may help bank managers maintain their positions. This sort of situation - where the <b>creditor</b> <b>bank</b> itself faces a crisis - may increase the bargaining power of the debtor company in private workout negotiations and the <b>creditor</b> <b>bank</b> may be obliged to compromise on terms unfavorable to the bank. This paper attempts to examine such a possibility by applying event study methodology to private workout cases with debt forgiveness. Sample events were identified by extracting newspaper reports that contained the keywords saiken hoki (debt waiver) and saimu menjo (debt forgiveness) and that appeared in four financial newspapers - Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Nikkei Sangyo Shimbun, Nikkei Ryutsu Shimbun and Nikkei Kinyu Shimbun - during the period from January 1993 - January 2004. Our findings show that in cases where the leading creditor bank's risk exposure to the debtor was high, the share price of the debtor company significantly increased and the share price of the main bank significantly decreased upon the debtor's request for debt relief including debt forgiveness. This indicates that the market was already anticipating that a debt relief agreement would be reached in a way favorable to the shareholders of the debtor company with portions of risks against additional financial loss transferred from the debtor to its leading <b>creditor</b> <b>bank.</b> Therefore, {{there is a possibility that}} the supervising authorities' straightforward approach - reinforced monitoring and stricter assessment of bank assets - is critical to the fundamental solution to the forbearance lending problem. ...|$|E

However, we find that the bank often finances a bidder, and we derive an incentive-compatible bid strategy for a bank-bidder coalition. In our theory, the coalition’s optimal bid exceeds the private valuation of the bank’s coalition partner (overbidding) and effectively mimics the monopoly sales price. We present cross-sectional evidence on auction premiums that supports the overbidding theory.

I show that a bank’s conditional commitment to support the financially distressed firm may inject a degree of strategic solidity among other creditors and reduce the deadweight costs of inefficient liquidation. However, should a bank’s concession be made conditional on a high tendering rate by other creditors, this may negate the positive information externality of bank’s action. Low minimum tendering rates, on the other hand, may lead to multiple equilibria in creditors ’ strategies; but, all those equilibria are shown to be Pareto improving of the unique equilibrium {{when there is no}} bank in the game.

40|$|First draft, July 2000 Revised 28. 11. 02 We analyze bidding {{incentives}} of {{the main}} <b>creditor</b> (<b>bank)</b> in Swedish bankruptcy auctions.

This is the recovery if the bank were to receive the piecemeal liquidation value announced by the auctioneer {{at the start of the}} auction. Since both the liquidation recovery and the final going-concern auction premium are observable, the overbidding theory is testable. We perform a large-sample, cross-sectional analysis where overbidding is picthed against asset-fire sale arguments. The latter hold that auctions tend to produce lower going-concern premiums when taking place during industry-wide financial distress, or when the firm is sold back to old owners or to industry outsiders.

40|$|We analyze bidding {{incentives}} and present direct evidence on liquidity and bid premiums in Swedish mandatory bankruptcy auctions. Three-quarters of the bankrupt firms are sold as going concerns (assets intact and financially restructured). These going-concern auctions are surprisingly liquid, {{both in terms}} of interested bidders and actual bids. The firm’s major <b>creditor</b> (<b>bank)</b> often finances a bidder and thus adds liquidity. We analyze optimal bank-bidder coalition bid strategies, show that the coalition under certain conditions overbids, and produce crosssectional evidence consistent with overbidding. At the same time, the premium evidence fail to support asset fire-sale arguments: neither going-concern premiums nor piecemeal liquidation values are dependent of the business cycle or industry-wide distress. We also show that bids by insiders to repurchase the firm (salebacks) occur in direct competition with outside investors and result in premiums that are indistinguishable from premiums in sales to company outsiders. There is no evidence that salebacks hurt junior creditors. Overall, the evidence suggests that the bank serves a fundamental role as a catalyst of liquidity and competition in the Swedis...|$|E

40|$|Any {{arrangement}} {{that is to}} serve as a long-term framework for international debt management must permit a politically acceptable rate of economic growth in the debtor countries while gradually improving the financial positions of the <b>creditor</b> <b>banks.</b> In addition, a realistic debt management strategy must maintain enough new lending to the debtor countries to provide an incentive for continued compliance with debt service responsibilities. This paper establishes the conditions under which these three goals are compatible. The analysis indicates that Argentina, Brazil and Mexico are now all capable of achieving significant rates of economic growth without debt write-downs or interest rate reductions. They do require additional amounts of credit but the resulting increases in the absolute size of their debts is compatible with declining ratios of debt to their own exports and to the total earnings of the <b>creditor</b> <b>banks.</b> Stated differently, limiting the ratio of debt service payments to GNP to country-specific standards, whether by long-term agreements or by annual negotiations, can achieve economic growth while improving the financial conditions of the <b>creditor</b> <b>banks.</b> ...|$|R

This paper provides information about management's views as to which type of debt -trade <b>creditor</b> <b>bank</b> loans- makes the firm look more unsafe to these stakeholders. Management's views should, indeed, be reflected in therm's earnings-management decisions: beefing up the reported earnings tends to reassure third parties, so firms whose funding depends more heavily on the dangerous type of debt should be more likely to manage their earnings upwards. We consider a large sample of unlisted Belgian firms and test which type of debt appears to trigger more earnings management. We find that earnings management is strongly related to bank debt while in the case of trade credit the association is, at best, indicative. This suggests that, in management's views, bank debt looks more alarming to parties that matter to the firm. Our findings have implications about the size of suppliers' quasi-equity stake in therm relative to banks' rent extraction, and these al-of-approval effect from bank loans, assuming banks are no worse informed about the firm than suppliers. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present the nature of credit rating and the role of rating in the process of raising capital. The credit rating plays more and more {{important}} role on the financial markets, especially on the international debt capital market. The main role of credit ratings is to enhance transparency in financial markets by reducing an information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders. Credit rating can help a company to widen an access to the credit providers and may result in lower borrowing costs. The role of the credit rating will increase because of an implementation of The New Basel Capital Accord (Basel II). The Accord’s rules will be fully implemented in 2008. According to the rules, a <b>creditor</b> (<b>bank)</b> will have to determine risk weights using external or internal rating. It seems, there will be a strong influence of the level of rating on the bank and on the borrowers.
