Kish is a large-volume near-molten waste skimmed from the molten iron feed to a basic oxygen furnace, and consists of a mix of graphite (precipitated out of the supersaturated iron), lime-rich slag, and some iron. The iron is recycled on site, leaving a mixture of graphite and slag. The best recovery process uses hydraulic classification (which utilizes a flow of water to separate minerals by specific gravity: graphite is light and settles nearly last) to get a 70% graphite rough <b>concentrate.</b> <b>Leaching</b> this concentrate with hydrochloric acid gives a 95% graphite product with a flake size ranging from 10 mesh down.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{hydrometallurgical process}} for the {{treatment}} of ilmenite concentrates is developed, {{in order to reduce the}} silicon content to the maximum allowed value for the production of "grade B" ferrotitanium. The process was based on pressure leaching with sodium hydroxide and the effect of the main leaching parameters, namely the temperature, sodium hydroxide concentration and retention time, on the efficiency of silicon removal was studied. Caustic leaching of the ilmenite concentrates resulted in the removal of silicon, as well as of aluminum, without affecting the contents of titanium and iron. Leaching temperature and the retention time were proved as crucial parameters for the effective dissolution of silicon. Besides, these parameters affected directly the secondary precipitation of silicon and aluminum as a zeolitic phase, which polluted the treated ilmenite <b>concentrate.</b> <b>Leaching</b> kinetics determined the feasibility of the process, leading to the development of two optimized alternatives. The first alternative achieved the reduction of silicon and aluminum content to 0. 32 % and 0. 61 %, respectively, after 72 h leaching at 120 degrees C. This alternative necessitated a leached solids washing stage in order to separate the formed precipitate from the treated ilmenite concentrate. The second alternative achieved to reduce silicon and aluminum to 0. 29 % and 0. 59 %, respectively, after 1 h leaching at 200 degrees C, while avoided the formation of the secondary precipitate. Both alternatives achieved the selective leaching of silicon and aluminum without affecting titanium and iron content of the ilmenite concentrate. The applicability of each alternative is a matter of detailed technical and economic studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Percolation of rainwater and/or the moisture content of the waste itself gives rise to the generation of dark-colored <b>concentrated</b> mixture that <b>leaches</b> from the waste in the form of ‘garbage juice’ (Sari et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2013 a, b). On an average, 1  ton of MSW in a landfill site produces 0.2  m 3 of leachate (Kurniawan and Lo 2009). Landfill leachate is characterized by the presence of high pH, suspended solids (SS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), color and alkalinity which can significantly contaminate the receiving water bodies (Kjeldsen et al. 2002; Adlan et al. 2011; Zhao et al. 2013 a, b; De Torres-Socías et al. 2014). Therefore, landfill leachate treatment has always been a subject of considerable interest (Oller et al. 2011; Sari et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|Iron ore {{concentrates}} {{with high}} grade sulfur cause several {{problems in the}} steel making process, and hence affect the concentrate price. Environmental issues such as sulfur dioxide emission during the concentrate pelletizing process and effect on the steel quality are other issues. The current study was focused on removal of sulfur from the iron ore concentrate by using the chemical leaching technique. The magnetite iron ore concentrate was chosen for this purpose. The results obtained showed that more than 90 % of the total sulfur content {{was removed from the}} iron ore <b>concentrate</b> by chemical <b>leaching.</b> Effects of several parameters such as temperature, particle size and use of organic solvent on sulfur removal were investigated by a series of experiments. After optimizing the experimental conditions, it was demonstrated that with addition of sulfur, phosphorus, another important impurity was also removed from the iron ore concentrate. In addition, one of the major advantages of our proposed method was transformation of mineral pyrites to useful by-products such as elemental sulfur...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} gold {{extraction}} from a refractory <b>concentrate</b> by chlorine <b>leaching.</b> The process considers a pre-treatment of refractory materials by low temperature oxidation {{carried out with}} low oxygen concentration. The oxidized material is treated by leaching with brine. After gold adsorption/reduction onto activated carbon, iron and base metals can be precipitated by NaOH. Roasting tests show the necessity {{to carry out a}} thermal pre-treatment at least at 550 C to obtain a reduction of sulfur and mercury in the material (50 % and 90 %, respectively). Highest gold extraction yield (around 93 %) is obtained in the leaching test performed with material sample treated at 650 C. This result confirms the necessity to optimize the thermal pre-treatment to improve Au recovery and to reduce chlorine consumption. A comparison with conventional cyanidation confirms that chlorination could be an useful alternative: in fact, gold extraction yield is quite low: 57 % in non-pre-treated material and 25 % in pre-treatment material. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the dissolution process of copper concentrate using sodium nitrate (NaNO 3) in a sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) medium under various controlling parameters, including dissolution temperature, time, particle size, solid/liquid (S/L) ratio and concentration of NaNO 3 and H 2 SO 4. The thermodynamic probability of mineral dissolution (CuFeS 2, Cu 2 S, CuS, FeS 2) reaction in the concentrate was estimated by standard Gibbs energy. The activation energy (E a) for the dissolution of copper concentrate was calculated as 15. 96 kJ/mol. Batch experimental results show that about 89. 9 % of copper in the intact <b>concentrate</b> have been <b>leached</b> and it increased to 96. 5 % at the fraction with < 25. 4 mm particle size. Copper leaching rate has direct correlation with increase in time, temperature, solid/liquid (S/L) ratio and H 2 SO 4 concentration. The XRD and XRF analyses of the solid residue after leaching revealed the presence of elemental sulfur. DOI: [URL] Mongolian Journal of Chemistry 15 (41), 2014, p 79 - 84 </p...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} cyanide-free leaching of pure gold and pressure oxidized refractory gold concentrate by thiosulfate-copper-ammonia solutions were examined. A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) {{was used to}} study gold leaching as a factorial series where the best gold leaching rate (2. 987 mg/(cm 2 ·h)) was achieved with a solution consisting of 0. 2 M (NH 4) 2 S 2 O 3, 1. 2 M NH 3, 0. 01 M CuSO 4 and 0. 4 M Na 2 SO 4. Temperature had the greatest effect on the gold leaching rate. An increase in thiosulfate concentration (0. 1 - 0. 2 M) increased gold dissolution. The combined effect of temperature and ammonia concentration had a statistically {{significant effect on the}} gold leaching rate at 0. 1 M M 2 S 2 O 3. Combination of applied potential and NH 3 :S 2 O 3 ratio had a statistically significant effect on the gold leaching rate at 0. 2 M M 2 S 2 O 3. An increase in applied potential decreased the gold dissolution rate at low ammonia concentrations but increased it at high concentrations. A pressure oxidized gold <b>concentrate</b> was <b>leached</b> for 6 hoursin the batch reactor leaching experiments. The effect of rotative velocity (1. 26 - 1. 56 m/s) and slurry density (10 - 30 wt%) was investigated at the following leaching parameters: 0. 2 M Na 2 S 2 O 3, 0. 6 M NH 3, 0. 01 M CuSO 4, 0. 4 M Na 2 SO 4. Lower slurry density (10 wt%) resulted in a higher Au leaching efficiency. An increase in the rotation rate did not {{have an effect on the}} final Au leaching recovery. The best Au leaching efficiency (89 %) was achieved with 590 rpm mixing, 1. 56 m/s rotative velocity and 10 wt% slurry density. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|To develop {{technology}} to assure an ample supply of zinc {{and to reduce}} environmental pollution, the U. S. Bureau of Mines investigated alternatives to the roast-leach process for treating complex sulfide concentrates. Previous studies proved that low-grade zinc sulfide (ZnS) <b>concentrates</b> could be <b>leached</b> using chlorine-oxygen to produce zinc chloride (ZnCI 2). The process involves high energy requirements for evaporating the pregnant solution to produce anhydrous ZnCl 2 needed for electrolytic cell feed. An efficient hydrometallurgical process would facilitate treatment of lower grade ores than {{can be used in}} conventional processing and would render roasting unnecessary. An alternative method was devised for recovering ZnCl 2 from solution. Zinc diammine chloride [Zn(NH 3) 2 CI 2] was precipitated from solution by adding ammonium chloride (NH 4 CI) and sparging with ammonia (NH 3) to a pH of 6 to 7. 5. The spent solution was treated with calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH) 21 at 6020 to 8020 C for 1 to 4 h to remove remaining zinc and NH 3. The Zn(NH 3) 2 CI 2 was heated to 30020 to 40020 C to remove NH 3 and produce anhydrous ZnCI 2. A possible flowsheet was devised and is included...|$|R
40|$|As global {{technologies}} and civilisation have advanced, {{the utilization of}} diverse mineral products has increased, resulting in the progressive depletion of high-grade mineral deposits. Consequently, metal production has to rely more {{on the use of}} lower-grade or complex ores, as well as metal extraction from mining and industrial wastes. Certain substances, such as phosphorous (P) and potassium (K), contained within the iron ore have a detrimental effect on the smelting process during steel manufacturing, resulting in the international steel making companies charging penalties when purchasing iron ore concentrates containing high concentrations of P and K. It has, therefore, become necessary to develop an economically viable and environmentally friendly process to reduce the high P and K concentrations contained in the iron ore concentrate of the Sishen Iron Ore Mine, resulting in the minimizing of the penalties charged by the steel making companies. During this study no microbial bioleaching candidates could be isolated from the aquatic environment in order to develop an economical process to remove the P and K from the iron ore concentrate. The most likely candidate for the removal of P and K from the iron ore concentrate would seem to be Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans that was isolated from the iron ore concentrate, however, this bacterium produces sulphuric acid, which is undesired in the iron ore industry due its corrosive properties. Furthermore, the P and K contained in the iron ore is in a non-sulphidic phase, and therefore, conventional bioleaching processes are not viable for their removal from the ore. Metals in certain nonsulphide minerals, such as the iron ore concentrate of the Sishen Iron Ore Mine may be solubilised by a process of complexation using microbially produced inorganic or organic acids. Chemical leaching of the iron ore concentrate using citric acid proved to be more efficient than “heap leaching”, as more P and K was removed from the iron ore concentrate, as well as in a shorter time frame. The results of the chemical leaching suggested that a 1 M citric acid leaching solution be used at 60 °C for 5 days for the chemical leaching process, as the most P and K is removed from the iron ore <b>concentrate</b> using these <b>leaching</b> conditions. The possibility to use A. niger as a bioleaching microorganism was also investigated, due to its ability to produce organic acids such as citric acid, which has the ability to remove P and K from the iron ore <b>concentrate</b> by chemical <b>leaching.</b> Compared to chemical leaching, which requires high concentrations of citric acid and/or high leaching temperatures, bioleaching using A. niger offers a more economical method with similar efficiency for the removal of P and K from the iron ore concentrate of the Sishen Iron Ore Mine. The most economically viable process for the removal of P and K from the iron ore concentrate, although not as efficient as chemical leaching using citric acid at high temperature, proved to be the bioleaching process using A. niger with a bioleaching pulp density of 33 % at 30 °C for 10 days. This is the first report of the use of A. niger for the use in any bioleaching process. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009. Microbiology and Plant Pathologyunrestricte...|$|R
