5|$|On August 10, 2001, on remand {{from the}} Florida Second District Court of Appeal, Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers {{claiming}} that new medical treatment could restore sufficient cognitive ability such that Terri Schiavo herself {{would be able}} to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to recuse himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001 the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Michael Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo's condition. (These decisions, all published in a single order by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo III in its later rulings.) In October 2002, on remand by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new computed axial tomography scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe <b>cerebral</b> <b>atrophy.</b> An EEG showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were Dr. William Maxfield, a radiologist, and four neurologists: Dr. William Hammesfahr, Dr. Ronald Cranford, Dr. Melvin Greer and Dr. Peter Bambakidis.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have found}} {{that there is a}} {{correlation}} between levels of quinolinic acid in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) severity. About 20% of HIV patients suffer from this disorder. Concentrations of quinolinic acid in the CSF are associated to different stages of HAND. For example, raised levels of quinolinic acid after infection are correlated to perceptual-motor slowing in patients. Then, in later stages of HIV, increased concentrations of quinolinic acid in the CSF of HAND patients correlates with HIV encephalitis and <b>cerebral</b> <b>atrophy.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>Cerebral</b> {{subcortical}} <b>atrophy</b> {{occurs in}} both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) but its significance for clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis between these common types of dementia {{has not been}} extensively investigated. Objectives: To compare the severity of <b>cerebral</b> subcortical <b>atrophy</b> in FTD and AD and to analyze the correlations between <b>cerebral</b> subcortical <b>atrophy</b> and demographics and clinical characteristics. Methods: Twenty three patients with FTD and 21 with AD formed the sample, which comprised 22 men and 22 women, aged 33 to 89, with mean age (±SD) of 68. 52 ± 12. 08 years, with schooling ranging from 1 to 20 years, with a mean (±SD) of 7. 35 ± 5. 54 years, and disease duration with a mean (±SD) of 3. 66 ± 3. 44 years. The degree of <b>cerebral</b> subcortical <b>atrophy</b> was measured indirectly with a linear measurement of subcortical atrophy, the Bifrontal Index (BFI), using magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluated cognition, {{activities of daily living}} and dementia severity with the Mini-Mental State Examination, Functional Activities Questionnaire and the Clinical Dementia Rating, respectively. Results: There was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) in BFI between FTD and AD. The severity of cognitive deficits (for both FTD and AD groups) and level of daily living activities (only for AD group) were correlated with BFI. Conclusions: A linear measurement of <b>cerebral</b> subcortical <b>atrophy</b> did not differentiate AD from FTD in this sample. Cognitive function (in both FTD and AD groups) and capacity for independent living (only in AD group) were inversely correlated with <b>cerebral</b> subcortical <b>atrophy...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in neurological disorders, 115 children were studied in two groups. Group A (78 patients) was studied by paired computed tomography and MRI cranial scans. Group B (37 patients) was studied by paired computed tomography assisted myelography (CTM) and MRI spinal scans. In group A, the scans were generally equivalent for supratentorial tumours and for investigating fits, hydrocephalus, benign intracranial hypertension, and <b>cerebral</b> <b>atrophies,</b> but MRI scanning was superior for posterior fossa tumours and cysts. In group B, MRI scans were superior for intramedullary spinal tumours, spinal dysraphic problems with tethering or syrinx, and were complementary to CTM in diastematomyelia...|$|R
25|$|Brain imaging has {{documented}} <b>cerebral</b> <b>atrophy,</b> {{which is a}} loss of neurons {{in the brain and}} the connections between them. Also documented were problems with the ventricular system in the brain, such as ventricular asymmetry and ventricular enlargement. Hydrocephalus has also been noted in children with 1p36 deletion syndrome. This is basically too much fluid within the brain. Hyperreflexia, which is defined as overactive or overresponsive reflexes in the body, was also found to be common. Many children also have epilepsy which is a disorder of the brain that results in recurrent, unprovoked seizures.|$|E
500|$|A {{physical}} examination, sometimes {{combined with}} a psychological examination, can determine whether {{the onset of the}} disease has begun. [...] Excessive unintentional movements of any part of the body are often the reason for seeking medical consultation. [...] If these are abrupt and have random timing and distribution, they suggest a diagnosis of HD. [...] Cognitive or behavioral symptoms are rarely the first symptoms diagnosed; they are usually only recognized in hindsight or when they develop further. [...] How far the disease has progressed can be measured using the unified Huntington's disease rating scale, which provides an overall rating system based on motor, behavioral, cognitive, and functional assessments. [...] Medical imaging, such as computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can show atrophy of the caudate nuclei early in the disease, as seen in the illustration to the right, but these changes are not, by themselves, diagnostic of HD. [...] <b>Cerebral</b> <b>atrophy</b> {{can be seen in the}} advanced stages of the disease. [...] Functional neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), can show changes in brain activity before the onset of physical symptoms, but they are experimental tools, and are not used clinically.|$|E
2500|$|Subdural hematomas {{are most}} often caused by head injury, when rapidly {{changing}} velocities within the skull may stretch and tear small bridging veins. Subdural hematomas due to head injury are described as traumatic. Much more common than epidural hemorrhages, subdural hemorrhages generally result from shearing injuries due to various rotational or linear forces. Subdural hemorrhage is a classic finding in shaken baby syndrome, in which similar shearing forces classically cause intra- and pre-retinal hemorrhages. [...] Subdural hematoma is also commonly seen in the elderly and in alcoholics, who have evidence of <b>cerebral</b> <b>atrophy.</b> <b>Cerebral</b> <b>atrophy</b> increases the length the bridging veins have to traverse between the two meningeal layers, hence increasing the likelihood of shearing forces causing a tear. It is also more common in patients on anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs, such as warfarin and aspirin. Patients on these medications can have a subdural hematoma after a relatively minor traumatic event.|$|E

2500|$|The use of EMG to {{identify}} nervous systems disorders {{is known as}} a nerve conduction study (NCS). [...] Nerve conduction studies can only diagnose diseases on the muscular and nerve level. [...] They cannot detect disease in the spinal cord or the brain. [...] In most disorders of the muscle, nerve, or neuromuscular junction, the latency time is increased. [...] This is a result of decreased nerve conduction or electrical stimulation {{at the site of the}} muscle. [...] In 50% of patients with <b>cerebral</b> <b>atrophy</b> cases, the M3 spinal reflex latency, was increased and on occasion separated from the M2 spinal reflex response. [...] The separation between the M2 and M3 spinal reflex responses is typically 20 milliseconds, but in patients with <b>cerebral</b> <b>atrophy,</b> the separation was increased to 50 ms. [...] In some cases, however, other muscles can compensate for the muscle suffering from decreased electrical stimulation. [...] In the compensatory muscle, the latency time is actually decreased in order to substitute for the function of the diseased muscle. [...] These kinds of studies are used in neuromechanics {{to identify}} motor disorders and their effects on a cellular and electrical level rather than a system motion level.|$|E

2500|$|Pathologically, DLB is {{characterized}} by the development of abnormal collections of (alpha-synuclein) protein within the cytoplasm of neurons (known as Lewy bodies). These intracellular collections of protein have similar structural features to [...] "classical" [...] Lewy bodies, seen subcortically in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, those affected by DLB experience a loss of dopamine-producing neurons (in the substantia nigra) {{in a manner similar to}} that seen in Parkinson's disease. A loss of acetylcholine-producing neurons (in the basal nucleus of Meynert and elsewhere) similar to that seen in Alzheimer's disease also is known to occur in those with DLB. <b>Cerebral</b> <b>atrophy</b> also occurs as the cerebral cortex degenerates. [...] Autopsy series have revealed the pathology of DLB is often concomitant with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. That is, when Lewy body inclusions are found in the cortex, they often co-occur with Alzheimer's disease pathology found primarily in the hippocampus, including senile plaques (deposited beta-amyloid protein), and granulovacuolar degeneration (grainy deposits within and a clear zone around hippocampal neurons). Neurofibrillary tangles (abnormally phosphorylated tau protein) are less common in DLB, although they are known to occur, and astrocyte abnormalities are also known to occur. Presently, whether DLB is an Alzheimer's variant or a separate disease entity is not clear. Unlike Alzheimer's disease, the brain may appear grossly normal with no visible signs of atrophy.|$|E
