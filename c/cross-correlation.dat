40|$|We {{show that}} widely used {{approaches}} in statistical physics incorrectly indicate {{the existence of}} power-law <b>cross-correlations</b> between financial stock market fluctuations measured over several years and the neuronal activity {{of the human brain}} lasting for only a few minutes. While such <b>cross-correlations</b> are nonsensical, no current methodology allows them to be reliably discarded, leaving researchers at greater risk when the spurious nature of <b>cross-correlations</b> is not clear from the unrelated origin of the time series and rather requires careful statistical estimation. Here we propose a theory and method (PLCC-test) which allows us to rigorously and robustly test for power-law <b>cross-correlations,</b> correctly detecting genuine and discarding spurious <b>cross-correlations,</b> thus establishing meaningful relationships between processes in complex physical systems.

25|$|Holographic PIV (HPIV) {{encompasses}} {{a variety of}} experimental techniques which use the interference of coherent light scattered by a particle and a reference beam to encode information of the amplitude and phase of the scattered light incident on a sensor plane. This encoded information, known as a hologram, can then be used to reconstruct the original intensity field by illuminating the hologram with the original reference beam via optical methods or digital approximations. The intensity field is interrogated using 3-D <b>cross-correlation</b> techniques to yield a velocity field.|$|E
25|$|In {{time domain}} OCT the {{pathlength}} of the reference arm is varied in time (the reference mirror is translated longitudinally). A property of low coherence interferometry is that interference, i.e. {{the series of}} dark and bright fringes, is only achieved when the path difference lies within the coherence length of the light source. This interference is called auto correlation in a symmetric interferometer (both arms have the same reflectivity), or <b>cross-correlation</b> in the common case. The envelope of this modulation changes as pathlength difference is varied, where {{the peak of the}} envelope corresponds to pathlength matching.|$|E
25|$|Thus, the Internet {{of things}} creates an {{opportunity}} to measure, collect and analyse an ever-increasing variety of behavioural statistics. <b>Cross-correlation</b> of this data could revolutionise the targeted marketing of products and services.

Big data and the IoT work in conjunction. From a media perspective, data is the key derivative of device interconnectivity, whilst being pivotal in allowing clearer accuracy in targeting. The Internet of things, therefore, transforms the media industry, companies and even governments, opening up a new era of economic growth and competitiveness.

30|$|The {{identification}} of asymmetric conditional heteroscedasticity is {{often based on}} sample <b>cross-correlations</b> between past and squared observations. In this paper we analyse the effects of outliers on these <b>cross-correlations</b> and, consequently, on the {{identification of}} asymmetric volatilities. We show that, as expected, one isolated big outlier biases the sample <b>cross-correlations</b> towards zero and hence could hide true leverage effect. Unlike, the presence {{of two or more}} big consecutive outliers could lead to detecting spurious asymmetries or asymmetries of the wrong sign. We also address the problem of robust estimation of the <b>cross-correlations</b> by extending some popular robust estimators of pairwise correlations and autocorrelations. Their finite sample resistance against outliers is compared through Monte Carlo experiments. Situations with isolated and patchy outliers of different sizes are examined. It is shown that a modified Ramsay-weighted estimator of the <b>cross-correlations</b> outperforms other estimators in identifying asymmetric conditionally heteroscedastic models. Finally, the results are illustrated with an empirical application.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the current <b>cross-correlations</b> {{in a double}} quantum dot based Cooper pair splitter coupled to one superconducting and two ferromagnetic electrodes. The analysis is performed by assuming a weak coupling between the double dot and ferromagnetic leads, while the coupling to the superconductor is arbitrary. Employing the perturbative real-time diagrammatic technique, we study the Andreev transport properties of the device, focusing on the Andreev current <b>cross-correlations,</b> for various parameters of the model, both in the linear and nonlinear response regimes. Depending on parameters and transport regime, we find {{both positive and negative}} current <b>cross-correlations.</b> Enhancement of the former type of <b>cross-correlations</b> indicates transport regimes, in which the device works with high Cooper pair splitting efficiency, contrary to the latter type of correlations, which imply negative influence on the splitting.

The measuring circuit collects noise contributions at the resonant frequency of the LC circuit. Auto-correlation noise can be canceled out by switching the wires and making two distinct measurements. The measured <b>cross-correlations</b> then depend of four non-symmetrized correlators. This detection method is applied to a normal metal three terminal device.
