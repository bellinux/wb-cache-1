5|$|Following its brief {{theatrical}} run, Universal Studios quickly {{sold the}} film's rights to <b>cable</b> <b>companies,</b> allowing Tender Mercies {{to be shown}} on television. When the film unexpectedly received five Academy Award nominations nearly a year after its original release, the studio attempted to redistribute the film to theaters; however, the <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> began televising the film about {{a week before the}} Oscar ceremony, which essentially halted any attempts at a theatrical rerelease. When the film first played on HBO in March 1984, it surpassed the three major networks in ratings for homes with cable televisions. Tender Mercies was released on VHS some time later, and was first released on DVD on June 22, 1999.|$|E

5|$|Before the event, the GFW {{broadcasts}} experienced setbacks. Many <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> {{decided not}} to air the event live, opting instead for a replay of UFC 182, and the stream would not run on {{three of the four}} most used devices compatible with Flipps: Chromecast, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. According to Dave Meltzer, NJPW undercut GFW by including the event in the $8.42 monthly price for New Japan Pro Wrestling World; the GFW broadcast of Wrestle Kingdom 9 alone was $34.95. The New Japan Pro Wrestling World stream had Japanese commentary only.|$|E

National {{testing in the}} United States for the service began in June, and deployment across the United States began in December, with a complete U.S. release in 1994. By June 1994, Sega Channel had gained a total of 21 <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> signed up to carry the service. Fees in the United States for the service varied depending on location, but were approximately US$15 monthly, plus a $25 activation fee, which included the adapter. The Sega Channel expanded into Canada in late 1995, with an approximately Can$19 monthly fee. During the planning stages of the service, Sega looked {{to capitalize on the}} rental market, which had seen some success with the Sega CD being rented through Blockbuster, Inc., and was looking to base the service's offering of games and demos to help sell more cartridges.|$|E
5|$|As a {{small but}} rapidly intensifying hurricane, Janet passed just south of Barbados on September22, {{becoming}} the first hurricane to strike the island in 57years, since the 1898 Windward Islands Hurricane. Maximum sustained winds {{on the south side}} of the island were estimated to be between 110–120mph (180–190km/h). The strong winds knocked out communication lines, preventing officials from accurately enumerating casualties on the island, though communications were still maintained by commercial <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> and amateur radio. Electric power was later restored, allowing newspapers to publish information on the storm. Sugar cane, the island country's main source of revenue, was severely damaged, with losses estimated to be in excess of $1million. Poorly constructed dwellings were blown apart by the strong winds. An estimated 8,100homes were damaged by the hurricane. The destroyed buildings and trees blocked highways, and the Seawell Airport was forced to close. Heavy rains peaked at 4in (100mm) and a storm surge of 7ft (2.1m) swept away low-lying houses along the coast. An estimated 2,000people were left homeless due to the hurricane. Property damage on Barbados was estimated to be $5million, and at least 57people were killed.|$|E

25|$|Under CRTC rules, <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> cannot offer a new American service if a {{comparable}} Canadian service already exists. However, if a Canadian equivalent begins operations after an American service {{has already been}} added to cable packages, the cable company {{is not required to}} discontinue the American service. (For example, Canadian <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> cannot offer MTV, as the station was not yet available in Canada when MuchMusic began broadcasting in 1984. However, <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> can offer CNN, as they were already offering that service when CBC Newsworld first aired in 1989.) The rules formerly required that the American service be removed if a Canadian equivalent is launched; this caused controversy when the US version of CMT was removed from the lineup when a new Canadian country music channel called the New Country Network launched. CMT had contested that this was a violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Ultimately, Viacom purchased a minority share in the network, and rebranded it under the CMT name.|$|E
