500|$|On the 7thJune, 1917, while {{disguised}} as a British merchant vessel with a dummy gun mounted aft, H.M.S. [...] "Pargust" [...] was torpedoed at very close range. Her boiler-room, engine-room, and No. 5 hold were immediately flooded, and the starboard lifeboat was blown to pieces. The weather was misty at the time, fresh breeze and a <b>choppy</b> <b>sea.</b> The [...] "Panic Party", {{under the command of}} Lieutenant F. R. Hereford, D.S.C., R.N.R., abandoned ship, and as the last boat was shoving off, the periscope of the submarine was observed close before the port beam about 400 yards distant. The enemy then submerged, and periscope reappeared directly astern, passing to the starboard quarter, and then round to the port beam, when it turned again towards the ship, breaking surface about 50 yards away. The lifeboat, acting as a lure, commenced to pull round the stern; submarine followed closely and Lieutenant Hereford, with complete disregard of the danger incurred from the fire of either ship or submarine (who had trained a maxim on the lifeboat), continued to decoy her to within 50 yards of the ship. The [...] "Pargust" [...] then opened fire with all guns, and the submarine, with oil squirting from her side and the crew pouring out of the conning tower, steamed slowly across the bows with a heavy list. The enemy crew held up their hands in token of surrender, whereupon fire immediately ceased. The submarine then began to move away at a gradually increasing speed, apparently endeavouring to escape in the mist. Fire was reopened until she sank, one man clinging to the bow as she went down. The boats, after a severe pull to the windward, succeeded in saving one officer and one man. American Destroyers and a British sloop arrived shortly afterwards, and the [...] "Pargust" [...] was towed back to port. As on the previous occasions, officers and men displayed the utmost courage and confidence in their captain, and the action serves as an example of what perfect discipline, when coupled with such confidence, can achieve.|$|E
60|$|The sun {{had long}} been up, the clouds were flying fast across the sky, and the wind was working round to the east, {{knocking}} up a short <b>choppy</b> <b>sea</b> as it met the ebb, and covering the river with white horses.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are big, Dan; {{but they}} are not so angry. The heads are not {{breaking}} over as they did last night, and the boat will go better over these long waves than she did through the <b>choppy</b> <b>sea</b> {{at the beginning of the}} gale." ...|$|E
5|$|Recent use of {{high-tensile steel}} allows {{building}} a structure with less material and weight while retaining similar strength. However, {{because it is}} thinner than regular steel, HT steel can corrode more easily, plus it can develop metal fatigue in <b>choppy</b> <b>seas.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The tug/barge made {{approximately}} 8 kn until {{reaching the}} open Gulf of St. Lawrence between Prince Edward Island and the Magdalen Islands, where Irving Maple reported wind gusts approaching 32 kn and <b>choppy</b> <b>seas</b> {{early on the}} morning of Monday, 7 September 1970.https://web.archive.org/web/20110725175720/http://www.edu.pe.ca/eastwiltshire/grass01/phys3f.htm ...|$|R
50|$|The team {{crossed the}} finish line in Plymouth on 20 August 2015 at 00:27:10 having {{completed}} the 608 miles in 3 days 12:17:10 throughout a mixed weather of very light winds and strong currents at the start and strong winds and <b>choppy</b> <b>seas</b> {{on the way back}} from the Rock.|$|R
6000|$|Half an {{hour later}} came another alarm. Somebody roared out: [...] "Breakers ahead!" [...] {{and in a moment}} more the Stormy Petrel {{was in the midst of}} a <b>choppy</b> <b>sea,</b> and {{staggered}} from side to side, as if ready to go over. Then came a scraping at the bottom.|$|E
60|$|As {{they passed}} the Nore a perfect fleet of steamers and sailing-vessels were at anchor there. Tide had turned {{strongly}} now, {{and there was a}} nasty heavy <b>choppy</b> <b>sea</b> until the Bessy passed the end of Southend Pier, when she entered comparatively smooth water. In less than half an hour the sails were lowered, and she anchored some fifty yards from the coast-guard station.|$|E
60|$|The curtain rose, {{the opera}} wound its slow length along. The {{audience}} loved it. They cheered with mad enthusiasm. Josephine {{looked down on}} the <b>choppy</b> <b>sea</b> of applause, white gloves clapping, heads shaking. The noise was strange and rattling. What a curious multiple object a theatre-audience was! It {{seemed to have a}} million heads, a million hands, and one monstrous, unnatural consciousness. The singers appeared before the curtain--the applause rose up like clouds of dust.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the more}} unusual {{applications}} of colza oil is the calming of <b>choppy</b> <b>seas,</b> where the oil modifies the surface {{tension of the}} water and rapidly smooths the surface. For this purpose, colza oil was carried in ship's lifeboats. Rescue and recovery operations have been made far less risky in this way.|$|R
50|$|Soon after, on 23 February 1941, Hamilton drowned off a Chelsea beach, in {{an attempt}} {{to save the life of}} a young girl who had got into {{difficulties}} in the <b>choppy</b> <b>seas.</b> His companions were able to bring the girl to shore and revive her, but Hamilton didn't make it back. His body was found 300 yards away on a sandbank.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the repairs}} were finally {{corrected}} after dockyard overhaul and a trial period, Wilmington continued cruising on the South American station {{through the summer}} and early fall of 1900. While en route to Rio de Janeiro on 10 May 1900, her inclinometer recorded 45° rolls in each direction while traversing heavy, <b>choppy</b> <b>seas.</b> On 16 October, she departed Pernambuco, Brazil, bound for the Far East.|$|R
60|$|When two-thirds {{around this}} oval plain, {{which was a}} mile long and perhaps one-fourth as wide, Jonathan ascended the hill to make a survey. The grass waved bright brown and golden in the sunshine, swished in the wind, and swept like a <b>choppy</b> <b>sea</b> to the {{opposite}} ridge. The hill was not densely wooded. In many places the red-brown foliage opened upon irregular patches, some black, as if having been burned over, others showing the yellow and purple colors of the low thickets and the gray, barren stones.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am never sick," [...] Richard explained. [...] "At least, I {{have only}} been {{actually}} sick once," [...] he corrected himself. [...] "That was crossing the Channel. But a <b>choppy</b> <b>sea,</b> I confess, or still worse, a swell, makes me distinctly uncomfortable. The great thing is never to miss a meal. You look at the food, and you say, 'I can't'; you take a mouthful, and Lord knows how you're going to swallow it; but persevere, and you often settle the attack for good. My wife's a coward." ...|$|E
60|$|Straight {{out they}} swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller. There was a slight, restless heave to the sea, {{and soon the}} three heads were disappearing behind it with greater frequency. He {{strained}} his eyes {{to keep them in}} sight, and finally fetched the telescope on to the veranda. A squall was making over from the direction of Florida; but then, she and her men laughed at squalls and the white <b>choppy</b> <b>sea</b> at such times. She certainly could swim, he had long since concluded. That came of her training in Hawaii. But sharks were sharks, and he had known of more than one good swimmer drowned in a tide-rip.|$|E
50|$|Bering Sea Gold (formerly: Bering Sea Gold: Under The Ice) is {{a reality}} {{television}} series, from the creators of the Deadliest Catch, set in Nome, Alaska that airs on Discovery Channel. As opposed to the summer version, Bering Sea Gold, with boats and issues of <b>choppy</b> <b>seas,</b> this series follows dredges housed in temporary shelters set up over ice holes. Viewers of Bering Sea Gold will recognize several crew members.|$|R
50|$|A few {{tried to}} swim. They were {{doomed to failure}} due {{to the dangers of}} the tides, {{offshore}} winds, <b>choppy</b> <b>seas</b> and sharks. Some took to crudely made rafts of driftwood and logs. One man lashed a door to two pine stools. Even a bath tub was tried. One pair planned to swim two horses across the bay with themselves as passengers. They were foiled by an alert warder.|$|R
5000|$|Jason-3 {{launched}} from Vandenberg Air Force Base {{on board a}} SpaceX Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle. [...] the satellite has been shipped to Vandenberg Air Force Base. After a June 2015 Falcon 9 launch failure, the mission was delayed and was launched January 17, 2016. The first stage failed to land safely on the pad due to <b>choppy</b> <b>seas</b> and a broken landing leg. at 10:42:18 AM PST.|$|R
6000|$|... "Put up the helm, Jack; {{the anchor}} is free. That is enough. Keep her jib just full {{and no more}} till we have stowed all away here." [...] When the chain was stowed below, and the anchor {{securely}} fastened, Tripper went aft and hauled in the main-sheet. [...] "Up with the foresail, Tom. That is it. You keep the tiller, Jack." [...] The two men now proceeded to coil down all the ropes, and get everything ship-shape and tidy. By {{the time they had}} finished, Harwich was fairly behind them, and they were laying their course a point or two outside the Naze, throwing the spray high each time the boat plunged into the short <b>choppy</b> <b>sea.</b>|$|E
60|$|After a {{fortnight}} Lord Surbiton got bored with Venice, {{and determined to}} run down the coast to Ravenna, as he heard {{that there was some}} capital cock-shooting in the Pinetum. Lord Arthur at first refused absolutely to come, but Surbiton, of whom he was extremely fond, finally persuaded him that if he stayed at Danieli's by himself he would be moped to death, and {{on the morning of the}} 15th they started, with a strong nor'-east wind blowing, and a rather <b>choppy</b> <b>sea.</b> The sport was excellent, and the free, open-air life brought the colour back to Lord Arthur's cheek, but about the 22nd he became anxious about Lady Clementina, and, in spite of Surbiton's remonstrances, came back to Venice by train.|$|E
6000|$|... 'II.--One {{afternoon}} I {{was sitting}} beside {{a young lady}} whom I had never seen or heard of before. She asked if she might look into my crystal, and while she did so I happened to look {{over her shoulder and}} saw a ship tossing on a very heavy <b>choppy</b> <b>sea,</b> although land was still visible in the dim distance. That vanished, and, as suddenly, a little house appeared with five or six (I forget now the exact number I then counted) steps leading up to the door. On the second step stood an old man reading a newspaper. In front of the house was a field of thick stubbly grass where some lambs, I was going to say, but they were more like very small sheep.. were grazing.|$|E
50|$|The {{first race}} was sailed in a stiff breeze and <b>choppy</b> <b>seas.</b> NZL 82 retired due to {{multiple}} gear {{failures in the}} rigging and the low cockpit unexpectedly taking onboard large quantities of water. The end of the boom snapped off due to increased stress caused {{by the weight of}} water in the boat. In addition the headsail pulled out of the groove in the forestay foil, damaging it and preventing a new sail from being hoisted.|$|R
5000|$|The show follows boats {{equipped}} with various setups to achieve gold mining in a summertime, cold northern latitude, shallow water, ocean environment. The fleet each typically {{consists of a}} sluicing apparatus, a means of [...] collection (dredge), and a cold-water-diving life support system. Conflict issues include <b>choppy</b> <b>seas,</b> poor underwater visibility, inconsistent fuel delivery, personnel issues, mining location rights, sufficient paydirt discovery, diver safety, and ocean-damaging equipment failures. Each season of episodes follow the current fleet of dredges.|$|R
50|$|As an {{additional}} risk factor the radar on Kvikk had a stabilizer {{that were made}} {{to ensure that the}} radar beam was kept level with the horizon so that it also would work in <b>choppy</b> <b>seas,</b> but this mechanism had a weakness that made the radar tip over many times and thus sending radiation directly down on the deck. Therefore the crew in many cases have been directly exposed to radiation at a very close hold when they were on the deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{makes it}} partly a {{mathematical}} problem, lad. But having the distance isn't everything, for {{that will only}} give us the height at which a gun should be elevated {{in order to make}} its charge cover that distance and hit the mark, instead of flying over it or ploughing the water below it. After getting the distance we have to calculate on how the enemy's vessel is moving, if she is under steam, and then, most important, we have to let the gun go off at just the right motion of our own craft. In some navies they discharge the guns on the upward roll of the ship, and in others on the downward roll. My private opinion on that point is, a downward roll in clear weather, and an upward roll in a <b>choppy</b> <b>sea,</b> when you don't know just what is coming next." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{fish had}} been hooked at eleven o'clock {{and it was}} now five. We had drifted or been pulled into the main channel, where strong {{currents}} and a <b>choppy</b> <b>sea</b> made the matter a pretty serious and uncomfortable one. Here I expended all I had left in a short and furious struggle to bring the fish up, if not to gaff, at least so we could see what he looked like. How strange and unfathomable a feeling this mystery of him gave rise to! If I could only see him once, then {{he could get away}} and welcome. Captain Dan, in anticipation of a need of much elbow room in that cockpit, ordered my brother and the ladies to go into the cabin or up on top. And they all scrambled up and lay flat on the deck-roof, with their heads over, watching me. They had to hold on some, too. In fact, they were having the time of their lives.|$|E
60|$|Far below {{over the}} <b>choppy</b> <b>sea</b> of waves {{he saw a}} bridge. It was his old {{familiar}} resting place. Through the white enveloping glow he seemed to see himself standing on that bridge. Then came to him a strange revelation. Yesterday he had stood on that bridge, after seeing Blair for the last time. He had stood there while he lived through an hour of the keenest anguish {{that had come to}} him; and in that agony he had watched the plunging river. He had watched it with eyes that could never forget. His mind, exquisitely alive, with the sensibility of a plexus of racked and broken nerves, had taken up every line, every channel and stone and rapid of that flood, and had engraved them in ineffaceable characters. With the unintelligible vagary of thought, while his breast seemed crushed, his heart broken, he had imagined himself adrift on that surging river, and he had planned his escape through the rapids.|$|E
50|$|On November 14, 1718, {{less than}} two weeks after the Worthylakes had drowned, Robert Saunders, John Chamberlin, and a man named Bradduck were hired to {{maintain}} Boston Light until a replacement light-keeper could be appointed. They were summoned by a ship entering the harbor, in <b>choppy</b> <b>seas,</b> and Chamberlin and Bradduck both drowned on their return trip to the island. This event also inspired Franklin in his lighthouse ballad, as Chamberlin was called upon for a trivial reason and not for navigational support.|$|R
