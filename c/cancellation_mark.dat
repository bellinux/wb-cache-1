This procedure marks the stamp as used to prevent its reuse. [...] In modern usage, postmarks generally indicate the date and point of origin of the mailing. The mailed item is then delivered to the address the customer has applied to the envelope or parcel.|$|E

25|$|After stamps were {{introduced}} in 1856, some post offices created new <b>cancellation</b> <b>marks,</b> while others used their existing handstamps bearing {{the name of the}} town for years to cancel the new stamps, so that very old handstamps can be found on stamped covers.|$|R
25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{grilling}} was {{to permit the}} canceling ink to be better absorbed into the stamp paper, thus preventing reuse of stamps by washing out the <b>cancellation</b> <b>marks.</b> The use of grills {{was found to be}} impractical and they were gradually discontinued after 1870.|$|R
5000|$|Retention {{of silent}} lettersMany loan words adopted from other {{languages}} have silent letters, and sometimes syllables, that {{were no longer}} pronounced, but provides clues to the original pronunciation and derivation of the word. In many cases, a special symbol was used to mark that the letters are silent. This <b>cancellation</b> <b>mark</b> {{is known as the}} การันต์, karan ( [...] , cf. Lao: ກາຣັນ/archaic ກາຣັນຕ໌, karan).|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{grilling}} {{was first}} suggested by Charles F. Steel, a supervisor at the National Bank Note Company, with correspondence {{on the subject}} dating from 1865. The purpose of grilling stamps was to break the paper fiber of the stamp. This would cause the ink <b>cancellation</b> <b>mark</b> to soak into the paper fiber making them more difficult to wash and reuse as postage.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cancellation</b> <b>mark</b> of {{the mail}} {{processed}} by the German {{system in the}} early period are {{the only means of}} identifying the point of use; such stamps are known as [...] "Vorläufer" [...] (forerunner) stamps. Later stamps are identified by overprints of the place of issuance even when not for postal use. German abroad stamps started appearing in the late 19th century and reached their heyday {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
50|$|After {{the stamp}} was circulating, {{it became obvious}} that black was not a good choice of stamp colour, since any <b>cancellation</b> <b>marks</b> were hard to see. So from 1841 onwards, the stamps were printed in a brick-red colour. The Penny Reds {{continued}} in use for decades with about 21 billion being produced.|$|R

50|$|While some {{collectors}} value mint postage stamps, others {{prefer to}} collect stamps {{that have been}} used. In practice, it is slow and difficult to build a comprehensive collection by removing stamps from mailed envelopes, so modern postal administrations accommodate collectors by offering new stamps already cancelled. The advantage for collectors is that the stamps count as officially used without being subjected to the stress of actually going through the mail. Also, the postal service can arrange a relatively light and unobtrusive <b>cancellation</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1957, the American Flag was {{featured}} on a U. S. stamp {{for the first}} time. The Post Office had long avoided this image, fearing accusations that, in issuing stamps on which they would be defacing the flag by <b>cancellation</b> <b>marks,</b> they would be both committing and fomenting desecration. However, protests against this initial flag issue were muted, and the flag has remained a perennially popular U. S. stamp subject ever since.|$|R

5000|$|Traditionally, no {{punctuation}} {{exists in}} either Thai, Isan, or Lao, save {{a handful of}} special symbols such as the <b>cancellation</b> <b>mark</b> (depicted over the letter representing /r/), repetition symbol, the ellipsis (used to shorten lengthy phrases, such as royal titles), and the et cetera symbol, which in Thai and Isan appear as ร์, ๆ, ฯ and ฯลฯ and Lao as ຣ໌, ໆ, ฯ and ฯລฯ, respectively. Another symbol, ๏ was formerly used in Thai and Lao to {{mark the beginning of}} chapters, paragraphs, or lines of a poem, but is now obsolete. Four tone marks (depicted over the letter representing /l/) are used, in Thai as ล่, ล้, ล็ and ล๋ which correspond to Lao as ລ່, ລ້, ລ໊ and ລ໋, respectively. In modern writing, Thai and Lao have both adopted the question mark [...] "?", exclamation point [...] "!", comma [...] ",", parentheses [...] " [...] (...) [...] ", hyphen [...] "-", ellipsis [...] "...", and period [...] "." [...] from their respective English and French sources. Since Isan adopted the Thai punctuation via English, the quotation marks [...] """" [...] are used instead of guillemets, [...] "«»", and spaces are not inserted before terminal punctuation marks. In Lao writing, the <b>cancellation</b> <b>mark,</b> the ellipsis, and the last two tone markers are relatively rare.|$|E
5000|$|Definitive German stamps {{were used}} first in German South-West Africa in 1888 {{and their use}} is only {{recognizable}} by the <b>cancellation</b> <b>mark</b> of the Colonial post office (i.e. [...] "Otyimbingue, Keetmanshoop, Windhoek, Swakopmund"). Starting in May 1897 German stamps with the overprint [...] "Deutsch-Südwest-Afrika" [...] and one year later [...] "Deutsch-Südwestafrika" [...] were used. The yacht issue was introduced in November 1900 inscripted [...] "Deutsch-Südwestafrika" [...] first without watermarks, and with lozenge water marks in 1906 and later.

50|$|The German colonies {{were all}} {{acquired}} between 1884 and 1899. They {{belonged to the}} Universal Postal Union and used the same postage rates as the mainland German Empire.

5000|$|The German {{post offices}} abroad were {{a network of}} post offices in foreign {{countries}} established by Germany to provide mail service where the local services were deemed unsafe or unreliable.

50|$|The {{lighthouse}} used {{to contain}} a small Canada Post office in the lower level {{during the summer months}} serving as the village post office where visitors could send postcards and letters.

The province of Nova Scotia has discussed taking ownership but has not made a decision.|$|E
