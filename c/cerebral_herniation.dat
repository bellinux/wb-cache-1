40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernomas {{are rare}} {{vascular}} anomalies and their expansile {{growth has been}} considered to be mainly due to recurrent hemorrhages. They are not generally reported to show aggressive behavior. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27 -year-old male presented with headache, visual disturbances, and a 17 -year history of seizures. He was known to have a temporal lobe lesion on CT scan, consistent with a diagnosis of cavernous malformation but with no relevant family history. Serial clinical and radiological follow-up revealed a progressive increase {{in the size of}} the lesion with formation of a growing cyst of 7 cm in diameter, which produced mass effect, resulting in the clinical picture of <b>cerebral</b> <b>herniation.</b> The patient underwent emergency surgical resection with symptomatic relief. There was no evidence of significant hemorrhage at surgery.

40|$|Abstract Lumbar {{puncture}} {{is important}} in the investigation of suspected CNS infection. However, there is genuine concern and controversy about the risk of <b>cerebral</b> <b>herniation</b> after lumbar puncture. CT scan brain is widely performed before lumbar puncture whenever raised intracranial pressure is suspected. The pros and cons of interposition of CT scanning before lumbar puncture pose a clinical dilemma and have led to confusion among paediatricians and even a delay in initiation of therapy. CT scan brain only provides structural information and is considered insensitive in the exclusion of raised intracranial pressure. Clinical signs, not a CT scan brain, are the best indicators of when to or when not to do lumbar puncture. To exercise caution, relevant questions need to be addressed before performing a lumbar puncture. Literature is reviewed regarding lumbar puncture and <b>cerebral</b> <b>herniation.</b> The aim is to formulate a rational approach in managing children with suspected CNS infection.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Recent {{reports and}} commentaries have {{emphasized}} the alleged risk of <b>cerebral</b> <b>herniation</b> com-plicating lumbar puncture performed to diagnose acute bacterial meningitis. Instead, knowledge of facts relevant to the disease process can provide a rational and reassur-ing approach to management. All cases of purulent men-ingitis are associated with increased intracranial pres-sure, but herniation is a rare complication (5 %). Despite suggestions to the contrary, cranial computed tomogra-phy (CT) is normal in most cases of purulent meningitis, including those with subsequent herniation. Addition-ally, CT {{may be associated with}} long-term radiation ef-fects. An accurate clinical history combined with recog-nition of the early systemic and neurologic findings of bacterial meningitis will indicate a safe setting for per-formance of a diagnostic lumbar puncture with little likelihood of complicating herniation. In contrast, in pa-tients in whom the disease process has progressed to the neurologic findings associated with impending <b>cerebral</b> <b>herniation,</b> a delay of the diagnostic procedure is indi-cated. In this latter circumstance, a different approach in management can be developed. Pediatrics 2003; 112 :e 174 –e 176...|$|E
40|$|There {{is still}} {{controversy}} on the clinical efficacy of small-window craniotomy (SWCT) for acute epidural hematoma with concurrent early-phase <b>cerebral</b> <b>herniation.</b> This study compared multiple surgical and prognostic parameters of SWCT versus ordinary large-window craniotomy (LWCT), which aimed at providing evidences for surgical decision. Compared with LWCT (N = 51), SWCT (N = 44) displayed shortened average operation time (P = 0. 000), reduced intraoperative blood loss (P = 0. 000) and lessened intraoperative blood transfusion (P = 0. 031). Moreover, {{there was no}} differences of postoperative residual hematoma (P = 0. 141), postoperative palinesthesia time (P = 0. 201), the ratio of postoperative secondary ischemia (P = 0. 865) or cerebral edema (P = 0. 879), and 6 -month Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score (P = 0. 603) between the two surgical approaches.   Results suggested that, for patients with acute epidural hematoma and concurrent early-phase <b>cerebral</b> <b>herniation,</b> SWCT could effectively evacuate hematoma and relief brain herniation without significant differences of effect and prognosis from LWCT. In addition, SWCT has several advantages such as significantly reduced operation time, intraoperative blood loss and blood transfusion.   doi:  10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2014. 05. 013 </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{child who}} {{presents}} with acute coma runs {{a high risk}} of cardiopulmonary insufficiency, direct brain injury or even <b>cerebral</b> <b>herniation.</b> The case-management of such child requires a coma-specific emergent evaluation, immediate treatment of any hypoxicischemic insults and of the underlying cause.

Methods – We performed a retrospective review of clinical records and imaging (MRI and MRA) of 34 children (8 months to 17 years) with arterial ischemic stroke. Results – The group contained 14 females and 20 males. Risk factors were congenital heart disease (CHD) in 8, sickle cell disease in 2, prothrombotic abnormali-ties in 7, vasculitis in 5 (varicella in 2, neuroborreliosis in 1), trauma in 3, steno-occlusive <b>cerebral</b> arteriopathy, <b>herniation</b> due to intracranial bleeding, complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage with vasospasm, and arterial dissection with and without previous trauma.

5000|$|In central herniation, the {{diencephalon}} {{and parts}} of the temporal lobes of both of the cerebral hemispheres are squeezed through a notch in the tentorium cerebelli. [...] Transtentorial herniation can occur when the brain moves either up or down across the tentorium, called ascending and descending transtentorial herniation respectively; however descending herniation is much more common. [...] Downward herniation can stretch branches of the basilar artery (pontine arteries), causing them to tear and bleed, known as a Duret hemorrhage. The result is usually fatal. Other symptoms of this type of herniation include small, dilated, fixed pupils with paralysis of upward eye movement giving the characteristic appearance of [...] "sunset eyes". Also found in these patients, often as a terminal complication is the development of diabetes insipidus due to the compression of the pituitary stalk. Radiographically, downward herniation is characterized by obliteration of the suprasellar cistern from temporal lobe herniation into the tentorial hiatus with associated compression on the <b>cerebral</b> peduncles.

MethodsBetween January 2010 and January 2013, 46 consecutive patients with TAAAs underwent endovascular aortic repair with mbEVARs. A custom-made device was used in 24 patients (group A, 52 %), with Crawford classification type I, 2 (8 %); type II, 4 (17 %); type III, 9 (38 %); and type IV/V, 9 (38 %), and the a t-branch endograft was used in 22 patients (group B, 47 %), with type II, 9 (41 %); type III, 12 (55 %); and type IV/V, 1 (4 %). The main outcome measure was technical success, defined as successful target revascularization without occlusion of the bridging endografts or type I or III endoleak at the completion angiography. Secondary end points were mortality, unplanned reinterventions, branch occlusion, paraplegia, and persistent (after discharge) paraparesis. ResultsTechnical success was 100 % in both groups. The 30 -day mortality was 8 % in group A (n = 2) and 0 % in group B (P =. 51). Survival rates at 6  months were 71 % in group A (mean follow-up, 13  ± 11  months) and 94 % in group B (mean follow-up, 6  ± 3  months; (P =. 04).

We report our experience with 12 children who presented with <b>cerebral</b> <b>herniation</b> due to traumatic brain swelling in whom decompressive craniectomy was used as an emergency. DESIGN: Prospective, observational. SETTING: Red Cross Children's Hospital. SUBJECTS: Children with severe traumatic brain injury and cerebral swelling. OUTCOME MEASURES: Computed tomography (CT) scanning, ICP control, clinical outcome. RESULTS: Despite the very poor clinical condition of these children preoperatively, aggressive management of the raised pressure resulted in unexpectedly good outcomes. CONCLUSION: Aggressive surgical measures to decrease ICP in the emergency situation can be of considerable benefit; the key concepts are selection of appropriate patients and early intervention...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity after decompressive craniectomy in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. A 27 -year-old man presented with clinical and tomographic signs of <b>cerebral</b> <b>herniation</b> secondary to TBI. Prior to decompressive craniectomy, hemodynamic study by perfusion computed tomography (CT) indicated diffuse cerebral hyperperfusion. Following surgical decompression, the patient recovered neurologically and perfusion CT disclosed {{a decrease in the}} intensity of cerebral perfusion. The patient's blood pressure levels were similar at both pre- and postoperative perfusion CT examinations. This finding provides indirect evidence that decompressive craniectomy may improve mechanisms of CBF regulation in TBI, providing pathophysiological insights in the cerebral hemodynamics of TBI patients. This is the first report analyzing the hemodynamic changes through perfusion CT (PCT) in a patient with decompressive craniotomy due to TBI. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} study is to evaluate the efficacy and limitations of two-session Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) alone for large meta-static brain tumors. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) patients with large metastatic brain tumors (volume [15 cm 3 in the supratentorial region or [10 cm 3 in the infratentorial region), and (ii) tumors not causing clinical signs of impending <b>cerebral</b> <b>herniation.</b> Twenty-eight lesions in 27 consecutive patients (18 men and 9 women, age range 32 to 88 years, median age 65 years) were included in this study. The radiosurgical protocol was as follows: 20 – 30 Gy given in two fractions 3 – 4 weeks apart. The local tumor control rate and the overall survival rate were calculated by using the Kaplan–Meier method. Median tumor volumes were 17. 8 cm 3 at first GKS an...|$|E
40|$|Cerebral edema often manifests {{after the}} {{development}} of cerebrovascular disease, {{particularly in the case}} of stroke, both ischemic and hemorrhagic. Without clinical intervention, the influx of water into brain tissues leads to increased intracranial pressure, <b>cerebral</b> <b>herniation,</b> and ultimately death. Strategies to manage {{the development of}} edema constitute a major unmet therapeutic need. However, despite its major clinical significance, the mechanisms underlying cerebral water transport and edema formation remain elusive. Aquaporins (AQPs) are a class of water channel proteins which have been implicated in the regulation of water homeostasis and cerebral edema formation, and thus represent a promising target for alleviating stroke-induced cerebral edema. This review examines the significance of relevant AQPs in stroke injury and subsequently explores neuroprotective strategies aimed at modulating AQP expression, with a particular focus on AQP 4, the most abundant AQP in the central nervous system...|$|E

Background. Contralateral subdural hygroma caused by decompressive craniectomy tends to combine with external <b>cerebral</b> <b>herniation,</b> causing neurological deficits. Material andMethods. Nine patients who underwent one-stage, simultaneous cranioplasty and contralateral subdural-peritoneal shunting were included in this study. Clinical outcome was assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale aswell asGlasgowComaScale,muscle power scoring system, and complications. Results. Postoperative computed tomography scans demonstrated completely resolved subdural hygroma and reversedmidline shifts, indicating excellent outcome. Among these 9 patients, 4 patients (44 %) had improved GOS following the proposed surgery. Four out of 4 patients with lethargy became alert and orientated following surgical intervention. Muscle strength improved significantly 5 months after surgery in 7 out of 7 patient...|$|E
