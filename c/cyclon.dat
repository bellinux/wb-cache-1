On June 25, 1983, he defeated Buddy Landel to add the CSP North American Heavyweight Championship. In a rare CSP card outside of Puerto Rican soil, Morales wrestled Hugo Savinovich in Trinidad. On September 10, 1983, The Medics recovered the titles from him and Colón. One week later, Morales faced Ric Flair in the first Aniversario event, winning the contest by disqualification. On January 6, 1984, he dropped the North American Heavyweight Championship o Sweet Daddy Siki. After wrestling <b>Cyclon</b> Negro in Trinidad and defeating Buddy Rose in a WWF event, Morales won a rematch against Siki, recovering the title. He held the belt until September 15, 1984, dropping it to Randy Savage during {{the final stage of}} his CSP stay. Another notable opponent was James J. Dillon.

50|$|The first {{lead-acid}} {{gel battery}} {{was invented by}} Elektrotechnische Fabrik Sonneberg in 1934. The modern gel or VRLA battery was invented by Otto Jache of Sonnenschein in 1957. The first AGM cell was the <b>Cyclon,</b> patented by Gates Rubber Corporation in 1972 and now produced by Enersys.The <b>cyclon</b> is a spiral-wound cell with thin lead foil electrodes. A number of manufacturers seized on the technology to implement it in cells with conventional flat plates. In the mid-1980s two UK companies, Chloride and Tungstone, simultaneously introduced 10 year life AGM batteries in capacities up to 400 Ah, stimulated by a British Telecom specification for batteries for support of new digital exchanges. In the same period, Gates acquired another UK company, Varley, specialising in aircraft and military batteries. Varley adapted the <b>Cyclon</b> lead foil technology to produce flat plate batteries with exceptional high rate output. These gained approval {{for a variety of}} aircraft including the BAe 125 and 146 business jets, the Harrier and its derivative the AV8B, and some F16 variants as the first alternatives to the normal NiCd batteries.|$|E

50|$|The blonde-haired Medusa {{was one of}} {{the three}} Gorgons, {{beautiful}} daughters of the sea with golden wings and golden claws. Many considered Medusa to be the most beautiful, as she was mortal, unlike her sisters Euryale and Stheno. She eventually met the gaze of Poseidon. Athena took notice of this, and cursed Medusa, transforming her hair into snakes and giving her a deadly gaze that turns any who look into her eyes to stone. The hero Perseus was given the task of slaying Medusa and taking her head. After using her decapitated head for his own use, Perseus threw it into the sea as he believed it too dangerous to keep.

40|$|Activation-induced {{cell death}} (AICD) plays an {{essential}} role in the contraction of activated T cells after eradication of pathogen.

Despite its prime importance in cell death, regulation of Fas expression in T cells is poorly understood.

Transgenic expression of <b>Cyclon</b> ameliorated autoimmune phenotype in mice lacking subunits of IL- 2 R. Transgenic expression of <b>Cyclon</b> markedly enhanced AICD through increased expression of Fas whose expression is essential for <b>Cyclon</b> action. Finally, we demonstrated that activated but not resting CD 4 + T cells with targeted deletion of a <b>Cyclon</b> allele show reduced AICD and expression of Fas, indicating a critical role of <b>Cyclon</b> in Fas expression in activated T cells.

40|$|International audienceImmuno-chemotherapy elicit high {{response}} rates in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma but heterogeneity in response duration is observed, with some patients achieving cure and others showing refractory disease or relapse. Using a transcriptome-powered targeted proteomics screen, we discovered a gene regulatory circuit involving the nuclear factor <b>CYCLON</b> which characterizes aggressive disease {{and resistance to}} the anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody, Rituximab, in high-risk B-cell lymphoma. <b>CYCLON</b> knockdown was found to inhibit the aggressivity of MYC-overexpressing tumours in mice and to modulate gene expression programs of biological relevance to lymphoma. Furthermore, <b>CYCLON</b> knockdown increased the sensitivity of human lymphoma B cells to Rituximab in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, this effect could be mimicked by in vitro treatment of lymphoma B cells with a small molecule inhibitor for BET bromodomain proteins (JQ 1). In summary, this work has identified <b>CYCLON</b> as a new MYC cooperating factor that autonomously drives aggressive tumour growth and Rituximab resistance in lymphoma. This resistance mechanism is amenable to next-generation epigenetic therapy by BET bromodomain inhibition, thereby providing a new combination therapy rationale for high-risk lymphoma...|$|E

40|$|Recently, a nongenomic {{cytotoxic}} {{component of}} the chemotherapeutic agent tamoxifen (TAM) has been identified that predominantly triggers mitochondrial events. The present study delineates the intracellular fate of TAM and studies its interaction with a spectrum of cell homeostasis modulators primarily relevant to mitochondria. The subcellular localization of TAM was assessed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The effect of the modulators on TAM cytotoxicity was assessed by standard MTT assays. Our findings show that in estrogen receptor positive MCF 7 breast adenocarcinoma cells and DU 145 human prostate cancer cells, TAM largely accumulates in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, but not lysosomes. Our results further demonstrate that in MCF 7, but not in DU 145 cells, mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I and III inhibitors exacerbate TAM toxicity with an order of potency of myxothiazol = stigmatellin > rotenone > antimycin A, suggesting a cell-specific cytotoxic interplay between mitochondrial complex I and III function and TAM action.
