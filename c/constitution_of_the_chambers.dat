The Italian electoral system and some <b>of</b> its drawbacks <b>The</b> Italian electoral law, like many others (for example, Mexico, Germany, Switzerland), wishes to achieve a double proportionality: on the one hand, Parliament seats should be assigned to parties, within each regional constituency, proportionally to the votes cast for the individual parties in the constituency; on the other hand, <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> national seats obtained by any given party should be distributed among the different constituencies proportionally to the votes obtained by the party in the single constituencies. According to the Italian <b>Constitution</b> <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> Deputies is equal to 630 seats. The country is partitioned into 27 multi-member regional constituencies and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> seats at stake in each regional constituency is proportional to <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> inhabitants, as provided by the latest population census.
