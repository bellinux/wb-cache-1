40|$|In {{the recent}} years, reformulating the {{mathematical}} description of physical laws in an algebraic form using tools from algebraic topology gained popularity in computational physics. Physical variables {{are defined as}} fluxes or circulations on oriented geometric elements {{of a pair of}} dual interlocked cell complexes, while physical laws are expressed in a metric-free fashion with incidence matrices. The metric and the material information are encoded in the discrete counterpart of the constitutive laws of materials, also referred to as constitutive or <b>material</b> <b>matrices.</b> The stability and consistency of the method is guaranteed by precise properties (symmetry, positive definiteness, consistency) that <b>material</b> <b>matrices</b> have to fulfill. The main advantage of this approach is that <b>material</b> <b>matrices,</b> even for arbitrary star-shaped polyhedral elements, can be geometrically defined, by simple closed-form expressions, in terms of the geometric elements of the primal and dual grids. That is why this original technique may be considered as a "Discrete Geometric Approach" (DGA) to computational physics.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>conducting</b> <b>materials</b> on the {{correlation}} of furan concentration in transformer oil and its spectral response characteristics. The presence of furan derivatives in aged-transformer oil {{has been one of}} the key indicators for solid dielectric deterioration. Identification and quantification of furan derivatives are currently performed using high performance liquid chromatography or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based on ASTM D 5837 standard. Although these techniques are well established, they need an expert personal to conduct the test and to analyse its results. Moreover, the test is relatively expensive and the analysis of oil sample may take days as most utilities sending transformer oil samples to external laboratories to be tested. Recently, it has been proven that furan concentration in transformer oil has a strong correlation to the oil spectral response. This paper is to validate this finding and to investigate {{the impact of}} <b>conducting</b> <b>materials</b> within transformer oil on this correlation. In this context, extensive experimental tests are conducted to assess the impact of various concentration of <b>conducting</b> <b>materials</b> (e. g., copper dust) dissolved in transformer oil samples of different furan contents on its absorption and transmission spectra.
