5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, 1835, Jackson {{sent two}} representatives from Washington, D.C., Richard Rush of Pennsylvania and Benjamin Chew Howard of Maryland, to Toledo to {{arbitrate}} {{the conflict and}} present a compromise to both governments. The proposal, presented on April 7, recommended that the re-survey to mark the Harris Line commence without further interruption by Michigan, and that {{the residents of the}} affected region be allowed to choose their own state or territorial governments until the <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> definitively settle the matter.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{objections}} {{were raised}} in House debates as to whether both houses of <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> constitutionally authorize admission of territories, rather than states. Moreover, if the Republic of Texas, a nation in its own right, were admitted as a state, its territorial boundaries, property relations (including slave property), debts and public lands would require a Senate-ratified treaty. Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $10 million in Texas debt, resenting the deluge of speculators, who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas House bill. House Democrats, at an impasse, relinquished the legislative initiative to the southern Whigs.|$|E
50|$|This dilemma {{was seen}} {{most notably in}} 1861 and 1933, after the {{elections}} of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt, respectively, plus the newly elected Senators and Representatives. Under the Constitution at the time, these presidents had to wait four months before they and the incoming <b>Congresses</b> <b>could</b> deal with the secession of Southern states and the Great Depression respectively.|$|R
2500|$|Non-Soviet Eastern Bloc {{communist}} parties held congresses {{every five}} years, {{not long after}} the Soviet Communist Party had held its congress, to elect central committees and endorse new party programs, though [...] "emergency" [...] <b>congresses</b> <b>could</b> be called by central committees. [...] Attendance at party congresses was frequently given as a reward for long service. [...] Parties also sometimes held national conferences to address specific issues.|$|R
50|$|By the Russian Constitution VTsIK was {{obligated to}} convene the All-Russian Congress of Soviets not fewer than two {{times a year}} (Statute 26 of Article XI). Extraordinary <b>Congresses</b> <b>could</b> be called whether from the {{initiative}} of VTsIK or on the request of local Soviets. The VTsIK was elected by the full Congress, {{with no more than}} 200 individuals. It was completely responsible to the Congress. The functions of the Collegiate or the Presidium were not declared in the Constitution but presumably {{they were supposed to be}} purely supervisory or revisionary bodies.|$|R
5|$|In 1926, Taft {{wrote for}} a 6–3 {{majority}} in Myers v. United States that <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> {{not require the}} president to get Senate approval before removing an appointee. Taft noted {{that there is no}} restriction of the president's power to remove officials in the constitution. Although Myers involved the removal of a postmaster, Taft in his opinion found invalid the repealed Tenure of Office Act, for violation of which his presidential predecessor, Andrew Johnson, had been impeached, though acquitted by the Senate. Taft valued Myers as his most important opinion.|$|E
5|$|Senators raised {{concerns}} that the <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> either abuse such authority or neglect to enact any such legislation after the adoption of this proposal. Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, a long-time advocate for addressing the disability question, spearheaded the effort until {{he died of a}} heart attack on August 10, 1963. Senator Keating was defeated in the 1964 election, but Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska took up Keating's cause as a new member of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments.|$|E
5|$|Texans were {{hesitant}} {{to pursue a}} US-Texas treaty without a written commitment of military defense from America, since a full-scale military attack by Mexico seemed likely when the negotiations became public. If ratification of the annexation measure stalled in the US Senate, Texas could face a war alone against Mexico. Because only <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> declare war, the Tyler administration lacked the constitutional authority to commit the US to support of Texas. But when Secretary Upshur provided a verbal assurance of military defense, President Houston, responding to urgent calls for annexation from the Texas Congress of December 1843, authorized the reopening of annexation negotiations.|$|E

5000|$|The Orthodox Congress was {{a meeting}} held on September 13, 1922, in Berat, Albania among Albanian Orthodox people, which decided the Autocephaly of the Church of Albania. According to the {{decisions}} of the <b>Congress,</b> mass <b>could</b> be said exclusively in the Albanian language ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{clashes between}} the Bolshevik-Polish-Latvian and the Menshevik-Bundist sides, Trotsky (who had escaped from captivity) acted as an {{intermediary}} (attending as a non-voting delegate). Having adopted a 'centrist' position, {{he was the}} sole person at the <b>Congress</b> who <b>could</b> mediate between the two sides.|$|R
5|$|The Citizenship Clause {{overruled}} the Supreme Court's Dred Scott {{decision that}} black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship. Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about {{the constitutionality of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1866, or to ensure that no subsequent <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule.|$|E
5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E
5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} unity of the opposition parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference. The victory is attributed to the electoral alliance between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job of managing the state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United Front was so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the fact that the United Front was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E
50|$|In its heyday, the <b>Congress</b> Theater <b>could</b> seat over 2,500 moviegoers {{and also}} had storefronts facing the streets. More recently, the theater {{operated}} as a 3,500-capacity live music venue. The theater {{was also used}} for professional wrestling shows by Dragon Gate USA beginning in 2009.|$|R

40|$|This report briefly {{describes}} {{the shift in}} the international security environment that some observers believe has occurred, and identifies some defense related issues for <b>Congress</b> that <b>could</b> arise from it.

5|$|Early in the Act's {{enforcement}} history, the Supreme Court {{addressed the}} constitutionality of several provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. In Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966), the Court upheld {{the constitutionality of}} Section 4(e). This section prohibits jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to citizens who attain a sixth-grade education in an American school in which the predominant language was Spanish, such as schools in Puerto Rico. Although the Court had earlier held in Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections (1959) that literacy tests did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, in Morgan the Court held that <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> enforce Fourteenth Amendment rights—such {{as the right to}} vote—by prohibiting conduct it deemed to interfere with such rights, even if that conduct may not be independently unconstitutional. After Congress created a nationwide ban on all literacy tests and similar devices in 1970 by enacting Section 201, the Court upheld the ban as constitutional in Oregon v. Mitchell (1970).|$|E
5|$|Lara {{appealed the}} denial of his motion to dismiss to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the Tribal Court {{obtained}} its authority from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed {{the decision of the}} District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the sovereignty of the United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> address the jurisdictional system, which Congress did. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the sovereignty of the tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the Petite claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.|$|E
5|$|States sent Union regiments {{south in}} {{response}} to Lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion. On April 19, mobs in Baltimore, which controlled the rail links, attacked Union troops who were changing trains, and local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. The Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington. John Merryman, a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander, Roger B. Taney, author of the controversial pro-slavery Dred Scott opinion, to issue a writ of habeas corpus, and in June Taney, acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court, issued the writ, because in his opinion only <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> suspend the writ. Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the Ex parte Merryman ruling.|$|E

Montague, National Restaurant Association president, while in OKC {{referred}} specifically to recently-amended administration legislation that soon comes before both houses of <b>Congress</b> that <b>could</b> affect the nation's restaurant industry severely; potentially costing around $ 2 billion, and costing up to 200, 000 employees their jobs. ...|$|R
5|$|The CSR {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} insurance companies to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those earning less than 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). The second and larger type of subsidy, the premium tax credits designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium tax credits. A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide to appropriate funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject of}} a {{permanent}} capital for the United States was discussed numerous times during the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, however, the Continental <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> never agree on a site due to regional loyalties and tensions. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation selected New York City as the nation's temporary capital under the incoming federal government. The framers of the Constitution granted the new U.S. Congress exclusive governing jurisdiction over a federal district, intentionally separate from not beholden to any state. The Constitution, however, said nothing about where it would be. Discussions during the 1st Congress about where to locate the permanent seat of government revolved around two locations: one site on the Potomac River near Georgetown; and another site on the Susquehanna River near Wrights Ferry (now Columbia, Pennsylvania). The Susquehanna River site {{was approved by the}} House in September 1789, while legislation under consideration in the Senate specified a site on the Delaware River near Germantown, Pennsylvania. No agreement was reached, and the subject was deferred until the second session.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin {{worked to}} deny Douglas the 1860 Democratic presidential nomination, feeling {{he had turned}} against the South. Douglas contended that {{although}} the Supreme Court, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, had stated <b>Congress</b> <b>could</b> not restrict slavery in the territories, the people of each territory could pass legislation to bar it. This position was anathema to the South. Benjamin praised Douglas's opponent in his re-election bid, former congressman Abraham Lincoln, for at least being true to his principles as an opponent of the expansion of slavery, whereas the senator considered Douglas to be a hypocrite. Benjamin was joined in his opposition to Douglas by Senator Davis; the two were so successful that the 1860 convention {{was not able to}} nominate anyone and split into Northern and Southern factions. The Northerners backed Douglas while Southern delegates chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. Despite their agreement in opposing Douglas, Benjamin and Davis differed on some race issues: in May, Benjamin voted for a bill to aid Africans liberated by U.S. naval vessels from illegal slave ships, in order to return them to their native continent from Key West. Davis and many other Southerners opposed the bill.|$|E

50|$|To {{avoid the}} {{influence}} of the executive power in the legislative activity of the congress, the legislators were granted immunity of judicial interrogation on subjects connected to their activity, and couldn't be arrested unless In flagrante delicto; only the <b>congress</b> itself <b>could</b> revoke such privileges and allow the investigation to take course by a competent judge.|$|R
