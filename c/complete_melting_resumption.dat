In this paper, we use numerical simulation for a particular energy-conserving one-phase version of the problem to show that kinetic undercooling regularises this blow-up, so that the model with both surface tension and kinetic undercooling has solutions that are regular right up to <b>complete</b> <b>melting.</b> By examining the regime in which the dimensionless kinetic undercooling parameter is small, our results demonstrate how physically realistic solutions to this Stefan problem are consistent with observations of abrupt melting of nanoscaled particles...|$|R

In jetted ice, incipient <b>melting,</b> <b>complete</b> <b>melting,</b> and incipient vaporization occur, upon release to low pressure, at impact velocities of 1. 3, 2. 0, and 2. 7 km/sec, respectively, {{much less than the}} 3. 4, 4. 4, and 5. 3 km/sec, required in head-on collisions.

40|$|X-ray microtomography (XMT), X-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD) {{and magnetic}} hysteresis measurements {{were used to}} determine micrometeorite internal structure, mineralogy, crystallography, and physical properties at ~μm resolution. The study samples include unmelted, partially melted (scoriaceous) and completely melted (cosmic spherules) micrometeorites. This variety not only allows comparison of the mineralogy and porosity of these three micrometeorite types, but also reveals changes in meteoroid properties during atmospheric entry at various velocities. At low entry velocities, meteoroids do not melt, and their physical properties do not change. The porosity of unmelted micrometeorites varies considerably (0 - 12 %) with one friable example having porosity around 50 %. At higher velocities, the range of meteoroid porosity narrows, but average porosity increases (to 16 - 27 %) due to volatile evaporation and partial melting (scoriaceous phase). Metal distribution seems to be mostly unaffected at this stage. At even higher entry velocities, <b>complete</b> <b>melting</b> follows the scoriaceous phase. <b>Complete</b> <b>melting</b> is accompanied by metal oxidation and redistribution, loss of porosity (1 ± 1 %), and narrowing of the bulk (3. 2 ± 0. 5 g/cm 3) and grain (3. 3 ± 0. 5 g/cm 3) density range.

Above the HEL and to 150 kbar the pressure-density Hugoniot is closely described by a hydrostatic equation of state constructed from ultrasonic data for single-crystal plagioclase and pyroxene. Above - 150 kbar, the Hugoniot states indicate that a series {{of one or more}} shock-induced phase changes are occurring in the plagioclase and pyroxene. From Hugoniot data for both the single-crystal minerals and the Frederick diabase, we infer that the shock-induced high-pressure phases in 15, 418 probably consist of a 3. 71 g/cm^ 3 density, high-pressure structure for plagioclase (An_(93)) and a 4. 70 g/cm^ 3 perovskite-type structure (En_(64)) for pyroxene.

40|$|Gold {{nanorods}} {{have been}} found to change their shape after excitation with intense pulsed laser irradiation. The final irradiation products strongly depend on the energy of the laser pulse as well as on its width. We performed a series of measurements in which the excitation power was varied over the range of the output power of an amplified femtosecond laser system producing pulses of 100 fs duration and a nanosecond optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser system having a pulse width of 7 ns. The shape transformations of the gold nanorods are followed by two techniques: (1) visible absorption spectroscopy by monitoring the changes in the plasmon absorption bands characteristic for gold nanoparticles; (2) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in order to analyze the final shape and size distribution. While at high laser fluences (1 J cm- 2) the gold nanoparticles fragment, a melting of the nanorods into spherical nanoparticles (nanodots) is observed when the laser energy is lowered.
