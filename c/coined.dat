5|$|Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot <b>coined</b> the {{binomial}} Dromaiusater in 1817. In 1906, Walter Baldwin Spencer <b>coined</b> {{the name}} Dromaiusminor {{based on some}} Pleistocene subfossil bones and eggshells found on King Island the same year, believing {{they were the first}} physical evidence of an emu from there. William Vincent Legge also <b>coined</b> a name for these remains, Dromaiusbassi, but at a later date. In his 1907 book Extinct Birds, Walter Rothschild stated that Vieillot's description actually referred to the mainland emu, and that the name D.ater was therefore invalid. Believing the skin in Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle of Paris was from Kangaroo Island, he made it the type specimen of his new species Dromaiusperoni, named after the French naturalist François Péron, who is the main source of information about the bird in life.|$|E

5000|$|In another variant, if a tossed <b>coin</b> {{comes to}} rest on {{any part of the}} <b>coin</b> closest to the wall(the leading <b>coin</b> before the toss),the player whose <b>coin</b> is on top, {{at the end of the}} game, is {{declared}} the winner even if the <b>coin</b> is further from the wall that the <b>coin</b> below. However, should another player toss a <b>coin</b> closer to the wall, than either of the stacked <b>coins,</b> that tossed <b>coin</b> then becomes the leading <b>coin.</b> In cases where two <b>coins</b> land on the leading <b>coin,</b> the closet upper <b>coin</b> to the wall wins (even if the <b>coin</b> below is closer to the wall). Under the same conditions, other games state that the owner of the upper <b>coin</b> collects only the <b>coin</b> below, but all other players get their <b>coins</b> returned to them. In this case, it leaves the owner of the lower <b>coin,</b> who was closest to the wall and once leading, the only player that does not get their <b>coin</b> returned. A case of, [...] "so close, yet so far" [...] In other games, under the same conditions (a <b>coin</b> coming {{to rest on}} top of the leading <b>coin),</b> the game is considered null and void, and each player picks up the <b>coin</b> they tossed. In all forms of the game, when no clear winner is determined, in cases where two or more <b>coins</b> are equally close to the wall and particularly when all are touching the wall, some rules declare the game null and void and all players have their <b>coins</b> returned to them, while other games state that the owners of the tied <b>coins</b> win and divide the remaining <b>coins</b> between them. Clearly, the last rule mentioned can create difficulties if the winnings are not divisible by whole <b>coins.</b> Therefore, generally, the rule is seldom played. Rules are established before any game begins.|$|R

A cyclone forms around a low-pressure area. Anticyclone, the term {{for the kind of}} weather around a high-pressure area, was <b>coined</b> in 1877 by Francis Galton to indicate an area whose winds revolved in the opposite direction of a cyclone. In British English, the opposite direction of clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise, making the label anticyclones a logical extension.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro <b>coins</b> in 2002 presented a unique opportunity to study the crossborder migration and the mixing process of <b>coins</b> in different euro-area countries. This note analyses how many euro <b>coins</b> flow from and into Germany and which composition of <b>coins</b> is to be expected in the long run. A simple model of <b>coin</b> migration is formulated and calibrated for Q 1 <b>coins.</b> The ratio of German <b>coins</b> circulating in Germany is likely to settle around 50 %if past growth of <b>coin</b> volumes continues. In contrast to banknotes, allocation of <b>coin</b> seigniorage depends on national <b>coin</b> issuance.
