Lenders will typically require that a mortgaged property be insured if the Down payment is less than 20 percent, and will usually require that the first full year's mortgage insurance premium (MIP) be paid in advance by the buyer. If the buyer has not already paid the insurance company directly, this would become another <b>closing</b> <b>cost</b> payable at <b>closing.</b> The buyer can request cancellation of PMI once their equity reaches 20 {{percent of the market}} value, and the lenders are required to automatically cancel the PMI once the equity reaches 22 percent by federal laws.|$|R

50|$|In {{this case}} the broker {{receives}} a credit or what's called yield spread premium (YSP). Yield spread premiums are the cash that a mortgage company receives for originating your loan. The broker provides the client and the documentation needed to process the loan and the lender pays them for providing this service in lieu of paying {{one of their own}} loan officers. Since a brokerage can have more than one loan officer originating loans, they can sometimes receive additional YSP for bringing in a volume amount of loans. This is normally based on funding more than 1 million in total loans per month. This can greatly benefit the borrower, especially since April 1, 2011. New laws have been implemented by the federal government mandating that all brokers have set pricing with the lenders they do business with. Brokers can receive so much YSP that they can provide you with a lower rate than if you went directly to the lender and they can pay for all your <b>closing</b> <b>cost</b> as opposed to the lender who would make you pay for all the third party fees on your own. You end up with a lower rate and lower fees. Since the new RESPA law as of April came into effect in 2011, brokers can no longer decide how much they want to make off of the loan. Instead they sign a contract in April stating that they will keep only a certain percentage of the YSP and the rest will go toward the borrowers <b>closing</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|R

5000|$|YSP {{can also}} be used by a {{mortgage}} broker to offer [...] "No Closing Cost" [...] loans. For example, if a borrower takes a $800,000 loan and the total <b>closing</b> <b>costs</b> amount to $5,000, the broker could increase the interest rate that pays the broker a YSP of say 1% and the broker could then credit the borrower $5,000 of the $8000 made in YSP towards his <b>closing</b> <b>costs.</b> The broker would still earn a $3,000 -paid by the YSP. This is almost always the case for loans advertised as [...] "no closing cost" [...] or [...] "no fee."
