5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{described}} as an outcaste and impure. Her association with pollution mainly streams from her relation to outcaste communities, considered to be polluted in Hindu society. These social groups deal in occupations deemed inauspicious and polluted like <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste,</b> meat-processing and working in cremation grounds. In a Nepali context, such groups are collectively called Matangi, who collect waste—including human waste—and other inauspicious things, and often live outside villages. Thus she is associated with death, pollution, inauspiciousness and the periphery of Hindu society.|$|E
5|$|Today, Poitevins {{are used}} mainly for driving, both in {{competitions}} and for leisure use. They {{are used to}} pull carriages for tourists. Members of the breed can be ridden more comfortably than other draft breeds due to their slimmer build. They are also used extensively for equine therapy in France. The Poitevin is used for light agricultural work in vineyards, and for maintenance of natural wetlands. The council of Ille-et-Vilaine acquired a herd of Poitevins to maintain the marshes in the area. The Poitevin also {{has been used in}} movies, as a mount for forest monitors in Melun, harnessed for urban work in Poitier and Niort, and for the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> on the island of Ré.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} glassblowing {{was found by}} Roman Ghirshman in Chogha Zanbil, where many glass bottles {{were found in the}} excavations of the 2nd millennium BC site. Later evidence comes from a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> from a glass shop, including fragments of glass tubes, glass rods and tiny blown bottles, which was dumped in a mikvah, a ritual bath in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, dated from 37 to 4 BC. Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are partially inflated by blowing through the open end while still hot to form a small bottle; thus they are considered as a rudimentary form of blowpipe.|$|E
25|$|After the sorting of {{materials}} is finished, the Zabbaleen sell the sorted materials, such as paper, tin, rags, plastic materials, cloth, etc. The Zabbaleen sell these sorted materials to factories that then reuse these products, such as paper, {{in the creation}} of new material. According to Engi Wassef, the director of the documentary film, Marina of the Zabbaleen, PT plastic, which is the plastic used to make plastic bottles for water and other beverages, {{is one of the most}} highly sought out materials. In the case of PT plastic, the Zabbaleen would even export this material to China. However, the simple re-sale of sorted materials is not the only activity that the Zabbaleen do in terms of re-using these materials. They also create new materials from the materials that they have sorted. For example, granulators are used to change regular opaque-colored plastic into small plastic pellets. From these plastic pellets, a variety of plastic product can then be made, including garbage bags and plastic hangers. Handmade crafts are also made from rags and paper. Thus, the Zabbaleen system is a multi-tier system that is not limited to the simple <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> but also encompasses the creation of new materials from found recyclables.|$|E

500|$|Around 40% of the {{population}} has access to sewers. However, only the toilet waste is connected to the sewer while sullage is discharged into the drains. Without a proper sanitation system, the practice of disposing sewage through septic tanks and directly discharging into Jhoras and open drains is prevalent. The entire city drains into the two rivers, Ranikhola and Roro Chu, through numerous small streams and Jhoras. Ranikhola and Roro Chu rivers confluence with Teesta River, the major source of drinking water to {{the population}} downstream. The densely populated urban area of Gangtok does not have a combined drainage system to drain out the storm water and waste water from the buildings. The estimated solid waste generated in Gangtok city is approximately 45tonnes. Only around 40% of this is collected by UDHD, while the remainder is indiscriminately thrown into Jhora, streets and valleys. The collected waste is disposed in a dump located about [...] from the city.

La Trobe Bateman had presented a project of running water, sewers and drains, which enhanced a previous proposal of the engineer John Coghlan. [...] These were put into practice and in 1874 Batement started construction of the network, which by 1880 provided water to a quarter of the city. [...] In 1873 he started construction of the sewage works. [...] In 1875, the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> was centralised with the creation of rubbish dumps.

The ox is initially supplied to the carter who ensures its upkeep and is able to purchase it after about 18 months activity.
