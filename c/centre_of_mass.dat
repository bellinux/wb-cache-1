5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E
5|$|The ellipse {{also served}} as the design basis for the Spitfire's fin and {{tailplane}} assembly, once again exploiting the shape's favourable aerodynamic characteristics. Both the elevators and rudder were shaped so that their <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> was shifted forward, thus reducing control-surface flutter. The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical and, later, horizontal tail surfaces {{to compensate for the}} altered aerodynamics, culminating in those of the Mk 22/24 series which were 25% larger in area than those of the Mk I.|$|E
5|$|The Skylon design {{features}} several distinct differences {{when compared with}} the earlier HOTOL programme. Whereas HOTOL would have launched from a rocket sled as a weight-saving measure, Skylon is to be equipped with conventional retractable undercarriage. The revised engine design, using the SABRE engine, is expected to offer higher performance than its predecessor. The rear mounted engine of HOTOL meant that the vehicle possessed intrinsically poor in-flight stability; early attempts to resolve this problem had ended up sacrificing much of HOTOL's payload potential, which in turn contributed to the failure of the overall project. Skylon's solution to the issue was to position its engines {{at the end of its}} wings, which located them further forward and much closer to the vehicle's longitudinal <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass,</b> thereby resolving the instability problem.|$|E

This study established the repeated reliability <b>of</b> segmental <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> when using 3 D photonic scanning (3 DPS).

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for comparing {{the shapes of}} tetrameric proteins whose three-dimensional structure is known. The <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> single subunits are calculated as Cartesian co-ordinates {{with respect to their}} three dyad axes. The axes are allocated {{on the basis of the}} extent of the intersubunit contacts that they relate. This results in the division of proteins into two classes called right-handed and left-handed. A second division, which also contains right-handed and left-handed forms, is made according to the distances between the <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the subunits measured across the two axes with the most extensive contacts. Two other parameters have been calculated from the coordinates; they are named "aplanarity" and "twist". The eight tetramers so far investigated are discussed. One, lactate dehydrogenase, cannot be treated in this way. Among the others, right-handed structures (according to both definitions) are found to be commoner; most have low twist; all are of fairly high aplanarity except phosphoglycerate mutase. Prealbumin is exceptional, being left-handed in both ways and of high twist; it has a figure-of-eight structure with the <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> lying in one plane. The changes in the quaternary structure of haemoglobin are also presented by using this approach; on deoxygenation the aplanarity and the twist decrease...|$|R
5|$|The bipedal-quadrupedal {{consensus}} was changed by a {{detailed study of}} the forelimbs of Plateosaurus by Bonnan and Senter (2007), which clearly showed that Plateosaurus was incapable of pronating its hands. The pronated position in some museum mounts had been achieved by exchanging the position of radius and ulna in the elbow. The lack of forelimb pronation meant that Plateosaurus was an obligate (i.e. unable to walk in any other way) biped. Further indicators for a purely bipedal mode of locomotion are the great difference in limb length (the hind limb is roughly {{twice as long as}} the forelimb), the very limited motion range of the forelimb, {{and the fact that the}} <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> rests squarely over the hind limbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Gliese 581c and its mass have been {{measured by the}} radial velocity method of detecting extrasolar planets. The mass of a planet is calculated by the small periodic movements around a common <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> between the host star Gliese 581 and its planets. When all six planets are fitted with a Keplerian solution, the minimum mass of the planet is determined to be 5.5 Earth masses. The radial velocity method cannot by itself determine the true mass, but it cannot be very much larger than this or the system would be dynamically unstable. Dynamical simulations of the Gliese 581 system which assume the orbits of the planets are coplanar indicate that the planets cannot exceed approximately 1.6 to 2 times their minimum masses or the planetary system would be unstable (this is primarily due to the interaction between planets e and b). For Gliese 581c, the upper bound is 10.4 Earth masses.|$|E
5|$|Six star {{systems have}} been found to contain exoplanets, of which two were {{discovered}} by the Doppler method and four by the transit method. 6 Lyncis, an orange subgiant that spent much of its life as an A-type or F-type main sequence star, is orbited by a planet with a minimum mass of 2.4 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 899 days. HD 75898 is a 3.8 ± 0.8 billion-year-old yellow star of spectral type G0V that has just begun expanding and cooling off the main sequence. It has a planet at least 2.51 times as massive as Jupiter orbiting with a period of around 418days. The <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> of the system is accelerating, indicating there is a third, more distant, component at least the size of Jupiter. Three star systems were found to have planets that were observed by the XO Telescope in Hawaii as they passed in front of them. XO-2 is a binary star system, both the stars of which are slightly less massive and cooler than the Sun and have planetary companions: XO-2S has a Saturn-mass planet at 0.13 au distance with a period of around 18 days, and one a little more massive than Jupiter at a distance of 0.48 au and with a period of around 120 days, and XO-2N has a hot Jupiter with around half Jupiter's mass that has an orbit of only 2.6 days. XO-4 is an F-type main sequence star that is a little hotter and more massive than the Sun that has a hot Jupiter orbiting with a period of around 4.1 days. XO-5 is a Sun-like star with a hot Jupiter about as massive as Jupiter that takes around 4.2 days to complete an orbit. WASP-13, a Sun-like star that has begun to swell and cool off the main sequence, had a transiting planet discovered by the SuperWASP program in 2009. The planet is around half as massive as Jupiter and takes 4.35 days to complete a revolution.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{systematic}} coarse-grained representation of block copolymers, whereby each block {{is reduced to}} a single ``soft blob'' and effective intra- as well as intermolecular interactions act between <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the blocks. The coarse-graining approach is applied to simple athermal lattice models of symmetric AB diblock copolymers, in particular to a Widom-Rowlinson-like model where blocks {{of the same species}} behave as ideal polymers (i. e. freely interpenetrate), while blocks of opposite species are mutually avoiding walks. This incompatibility drives microphase separation for copolymer solutions in the semi-dilute regime. An appropriate, consistent inversion procedure is used to extract effective inter- and intramolecular potentials from Monte Carlo results for the pair distribution functions <b>of</b> the block <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> in the infinite dilution limit.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{dissipative}} particle dynamics (DPD) approach for simulating the realignment of a nematic nanodroplet suspended in an isotropic fluid following a switch {{in the direction}} of an applied external magnetic field. The interaction of the mesogens with the external field is weak relative to the inter-molecular interactions. The simulations were used to investigate the way orientational equilibrium is re-established. The results reveal that the realignment process of the nanodroplet is consistent with its fluid structure. The reorientation of the nanodroplet as a whole is found to be caused by an internal structural rearrangement rather than a coherent rotation <b>of</b> the <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the mesogens about the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the nanodroplet. The switch in the field direction furthermore is found to induce a transient spatial variation in the orientational order of the long axes of the mesogens: the orientational order parameters decreases on moving from the core of the nanodroplet to the surface in contact with the isotropic environment. The results highlight differences between the time evolution of the orientation of the long molecular axes in the field and the rotations <b>of</b> the <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the mesogens about the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the nanodroplet...|$|R

25|$|This method {{consists}} of precisely measuring a star's {{position in the}} sky, and observing how that position changes over time. Originally, this was done visually, with hand-written records. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, this method used photographic plates, greatly improving the accuracy of the measurements as well as creating a data archive. If a star has a planet, then the gravitational influence of the planet will cause the star itself to move in a tiny circular or elliptical orbit. Effectively, star and planet each orbit around their mutual <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> (barycenter), as explained by solutions to the two-body problem. Since the star is much more massive, its orbit will be much smaller. Frequently, the mutual <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> will lie within the radius of the larger body. Consequently, it is easier to find planets around low-mass stars, especially brown dwarfs.|$|E
25|$|The bounce of an oval-shaped ball (such {{as those}} used in {{gridiron}} football or rugby football) is in general much less predictable than the bounce of a spherical ball. Depending on the ball's alignment at impact, the normal force can act ahead or behind the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> of the ball, and friction from the ground {{will depend on the}} alignment of the ball, as well as its rotation, spin, and impact velocity. Where the forces act with respect to the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> of the ball changes as the ball rolls on the ground, and all forces can exert a torque on the ball, including the normal force and the force of gravity. This can cause the ball to bounce forward, bounce back, or sideways. Because it is possible to transfer some rotational kinetic energy into translational kinetic energy, it is even possible for the COR to be greater than 1, or for the forward velocity of the ball to increase upon impact.|$|E
