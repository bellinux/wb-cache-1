The {{field test}} {{results show that}} {{existing}} double-pump confluence hydraulic system with <b>constant</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> of wheel loader could only save some energy while the load pressure is rather high(> 15 Mpa in the tests). However, the load pressure is usually low, especially when the wheel Loader is working on bulldozing operation or just steering and running. Thus, an optimized double-pump confluence hydraulic system was designed by adding a proportional valve and adjust operation rule, so that the output oil of steering pump flow into tank by the proportional valve while the load pressure is low and the relative position of joystick is not large(< 72 %), {{and in this way}} the throttle losses is reduced. Simulation results indicate that the optimized confluence hydraulic system could save 26. 2 % throttle losses while the wheel Loader is working on bulldozing operation...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the late}} 70 's, several {{research}} and development projects deal with future Power-by-Wire-technology for aircraft ight control systems, aiming to reduce the overall system weight, as well as installation and maintenance eort. The design of appropriate electrically powered actuators still is a key technology. An overview about typical functional and performance requirements on primary ight control actuators is given. With electro-hydrostatic actuators (EHAs), based on an electric motor driven pump directly connected to a hydro-cylinder, safety functions can be realized with low eort bymeans of small valves. The two basic EHA principles are considered here: the EHA-SM, having a <b>constant</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> driven by a speed controlled, electronically commutated brushless DC motor, and the EHA-SP, with an electrically controlled servopump driven by an uncontrolled AC induction motor. A rating method for these EHA-types is proposed to design components {{very close to the}} actual requirements, aiming at weight saving solutions. Using charac-teristic motor torque-speed curves as well as pump performance maps, partly leads to iterative solutions due to interdependencies between the components. Weight and typical dimension envelope estimates were developed as functions of the performance/design values calculated before. Finally, nonlinear dynamic simu-lation models are set up, thus completing a little 'toolbox ' helping the ight control actuation developer, particularly { but not exceptionally { during early project stages...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} design and initial results of a power-autonomous planar monopedal robot. The robot is a {{gasoline}} powered, two degree of freedom robot that runs in a circle, constrained by a boom. The robot uses hydraulic Series Elastic Actuators, force-controllable actuators which provide high force fidelity, moderate bandwidth, and low impedance. The actuators are mounted {{in the body of}} the robot, with cable drives transmitting power to the hip and knee joints of the leg. A two-stroke, gasoline engine drives a <b>constant</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> which pressurizes an accumulator. Absolute position and spring deflection of each of the Series Elastic Actuators are measured using linear encoders. The spring deflection is translated into force output and compared to desired force in a closed loop force-control algorithm implemented in software. The output signal of each force controller drives high performance servo valves which control flow to each of the pistons of the actuators. In designing the robot, we used a simulation-based iterative design approach. Preliminary estimates of the robot’s physical parameters were based on past experience and used to create a physically realistic simulation model of the robot. Next, a control algorithm was implemented in simulation to produce planar hopping. Using the joint power requirements and range of motions from simulation, we worked backward specifying pulley diameter, piston diameter and stroke, hydraulic pressure and flow, servo valve flow and bandwidth, gear pump flow, and engine powe...|$|E

The term loop applies to feedback; the more correct term is open versus closed [...] "circuit". Open center circuits use pumps which supply a continuous flow.

40|$|Supplying haptic {{or force}} {{feedback}} to operators using hydraulic machinery such as excavators {{has the potential}} to increase operator capabilities. Haptic, robotic, human-machine interfaces enable several enhancing features including coordinated motion control and programmable haptic feedback. Coordinated or resolved motion control supplies a more intuitive means of specifying the equipment's motion. Haptic feedback is used to relay meaningful information back to the user in the form of force signals about digging force acting on the bucket, programmable virtual constraints and system limitations imposed by the mechanism, maximum pressure or maximum flow. In order to make this technology economically viable, the benefits must offset the additional cost associated with implementation. One way to minimize this cost is to not use high-end hydraulic components. For smaller backhoes and mini-excavators this means that the hydraulic systems are comprised of a <b>constant</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> and proportional direction control valves. Hydraulic and haptic control techniques suitable for backhoes/excavators are developed and tested on a small backhoe test-bed. A virtual backhoe simulator is created for controller design and human evaluation. Not only is the virtual simulator modeled after the test-bed, but the control algorithm used in the simulator {{is the same as the}} actual backhoe test-bed. Data from human subject tests are presented that evaluate the control strategies on both the real and virtual backhoe. The end goal of this project is to incorporate coordinated haptic control algorithms that work with low-cost systems and maximize the enhancement of operator capabilities. Ph. D.

40|$|The {{variable}} displacement pump control system has greater energy-saving advantages and application prospects than the valve control system. However, the {{variable displacement}} pump control of differential cylinder is not concurrent with the existing technologies. The asymmetric pump-controlled cylinder is, therefore, used to balance the unequal volume flow through a single rod cylinder in closed-circuit system. This {{is considered to be}} an effective method. Nevertheless, the asymmetric axial piston pump (AAPP) is a <b>constant</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> In this study, variable-displacement asymmetric axial piston pump (VAPP) is investigated according to the same principle used in investigating AAPP. This study, therefore, aims at investigating the characteristics of VAPP. The variable-displacement output of VAPP is implemented by controlling the swash plate angle with angle feedback control circuit, which is composed of a servo proportional valve and an angular displacement sensor. The angular displacement sensor is connected to the swash plate. The simulation model of VAPP, which is set up through the ITI-SimulationX simulation platform, is used to predict VAPP’s characteristics. The purpose of implementing the experiment is to verify the theoretical results. Both the simulation and the experiment results demonstrated that the swash plate angle is controlled by a variable mechanism; when the swash plate angle increases, the flow of Port B and Port T increases while the response speed of Port B and Port T also accelerates. When the swash plate angle is constant, the flow of Port B and Port T increases along with the increase of pump speed, although the pressure-response speed of Port B is faster than that of Port T. Consequently, the flow pulsation of Port B and Port T tends to decrease gradually along with the increase of pump speed. When the pressure loaded on Port B equals to that of Port T, the flow ripple cycle of Port B is longer than that of Port T, whereas the peak flow of Port B is higher than that of Port T. Since the flow ripple of Port T is bigger than that of Port B, Port T should be connected to the low pressure sides or the oil tank so that it does not affect VAPP’s performance. Further, to avoid the backflow of VAPP from Port T to Port B, Port T cannot be loaded alone, and the loading pressure of Port T also cannot exceed that of Port B...|$|E

40|$|Due to many advantages, {{swash plate}} pumps are wide spread in {{hydraulic}} systems. The main advantages are the through drive capability, the adjustability {{and most of}} all, the high power density. Their application range is limited, historically, to 450 bar including medium and higher volume sizes. In higher pressure range, constant pumps such as wobbling disks or radial piston pumps are normally used. This is because the higher stressed parts can be dimensioned much bigger. Pumps with lower power such as <b>constant</b> <b>displacement</b> gear <b>pumps</b> are generally used in low price applications. In order to enlarge the application range of swash plate pumps, their advantages have to be further improved and strengthened. This paper shows by example how {{the pressure of the}} basic series A 4 VSO was increased up to a nominal pressure of 630 bar and the historical pressure mark of 450 bar could be exceeded. This increase in pressure level enables for example steel treatment manufacturers to reduce their component sizes without the need of a pressure transducer. Furthermore the power density of the redesigned HA 4 VSO was increased by 36 %, compared to the standard A 4 VSO, by significantly increasing the self-priming speed. On {{the other side of the}} application range, in lower power mobile applications such as small tractors, forklift and skid steer loader, there is an increasing demand for less exhaust emissions and better fuel economy. The energy saving potential by changing from a hydraulic system with constant hydraulic pumps to variable hydraulic pumps is already proven on high power applications. By developing the variable axial piston pump A 1 VO to the requirements of lower horse power application, it is now also possible to realize such savings in lower horse power applications. Furthermore efficiency of the pump itself can be improved. An example of this is shown by way of the new A 4 series 33...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used}} in auto-motive {{transmissions}} to provide pressurized fluid to various hydraulic components in the transmission and also lubricate the mechanical components. The output flow of these pumps increases with speed, almost linearly, but the flow requirements often saturate at higher speeds resulting in the excess flow draining back to the sump. This represents a parasitic loss in the transmission leading to a loss in fuel economy. To overcome this issue, variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{have been used in}} the transmission, where the output flow is reduced by controlling the <b>displacement</b> of the <b>pump.</b> The use of these pumps in automatic transmissions, has resulted in better fuel economy as compared to some types of fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> However, the literature does not fully explore the benefits of variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> to a specific type of transmission namely, dual-clutch transmission, that has different pressure & flow requirements than an epicyclic gear-train. This paper presents an analysis on the effect of pump selection on fuel economy in a five speed dual clutch transmission of a commercial vehicle. Models of the engine, transmission & vehicle are developed along with the models of two different types of pumps: a fixed <b>displacement</b> gerotor <b>pump</b> and a variable <b>displacement</b> vane <b>pump.</b> The models are then parameterized using experimental data and the fuel economy of the vehicle is simulated on a standard driving cycle. The results suggest that the fuel economy benefit obtained by the use of the variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> in dual clutch transmissions is comparable to that of automatic transmissions.

Momentum transfer pumps in conjunction {{with one or two}} positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are the most}} common configuration used to achieve high vacuums.

First it obtains a rough vacuum in the vessel being evacuated before the momentum transfer pump can be used to obtain the high vacuum, as momentum transfer pumps cannot start pumping at atmospheric pressures. Second the positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> backs up the momentum transfer pump by evacuating to low vacuum the accumulation of displaced molecules in the high vacuum pump. Entrapment pumps can be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require periodic regeneration of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions. Due to this requirement their available operational time can be unacceptably short in low and high vacuums, thus limiting their use to ultrahigh vacuums.

40|$|The {{majority}} of hydraulic systems are controlled using a metering valve {{or the use}} of variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> Metering valve control is compact and has a high control bandwidth, but it is energy inefficient due to throttling losses. Variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> are far more efficient as the pump only produces the required flow, but comes with the cost of additional bulk, sluggish response, and added cost. In a previous paper [1], a hydromechanical analog of an electronic switch-mode power supply was proposed to create the functional equivalent of a variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> This approach combines a fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> with a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) on/off valve, a check valve, and an accumulator.

This paper presents initial experimental validation of the concept as well as an investigation of the system efficiency.
