Neveplast is one of these, a newer material whose use is becoming even more common. This new type of mat, which uses a concentric arrangement of conical stems, is marketed for downhill, snowboarding and cross country skiing. Neveplast claims to be certified as having the same coefficient of friction between the surface and the ski as snow, allowing the skier a good side grip, with the same skis used on the snow, and without the need for water. The Neveplast <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> has a comparable diameter to the F.I.S. slalom pole standards used for training and competition in both slalom and giant slalom. Neveplast is also used for school camps. This surface is modular and flexible, used frequently also for Urban freestyle parks.A German provider that gurantees year round skiing is Mr. Snow. The company does not only produce dry slopes for downhill skiing, snowboarding and cross country skiing but also provides tubing tracks and rental opportunities for events. The material of Mr. Snow is claimed to have very good sliding capacities, is predictable in all climates and does not harm the ski or sliding surface. Mr. Snow works without the use of silicone which is not necessary to achieve good sliding characteristics. The snow carpet evidently has no negative enviromental impact. So the mats can remain on the surface 365 days a year. But it is also possible to remove them very quickly if it is required. Temporary using can be realized with the 20 sqm modules.|$|E
40|$|Film cooling is the {{introduction}} of secondary fluid (coolant) at one or more discrete locations along a surface exposed to a high temperature environment to protect that surface {{not only in the}} immediate region of injection but also in the downstream region," (Goldstien, 1971). The secondary air which is cool air were extracted from the compressor and injected near the blade surface (through holes or slots) to provide a layer of cool fluid between the hot gases and the blade surface thus reducing the heat transfer to the surface. Enormous numbers of experimental and computational investigations dealing with both the aerodynamic and the thermal aspect of film cooling have been made available ever since. At the early stage of its introduction, the experimental investigations were usually focused on either thermal or aerodynamic aspect of the study. However, with {{the introduction}} of the laser based measurement (PIV and LDV), which reduce the complexity of aerodynamic measurements, most of current literature involving film cooling will have both, the thermal and the aerodynamic aspect of the study. Most of the available literature involved a discrete hole or single row <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> with common hole inclination angle towards the streamwise direction at 30 " and 35 ". Although earlier researches have proved that decreasing the hole inclination angle could provide better film cooling performance, there are very few literature available with regards the hole inclination angle lower than 30 ". Based on these facts, the present study intended to investigate the aero-thermal interaction of a multiple shallow hole angle. In addition to the experiments, computational investigation has been extensively used in particular to explore the potential of new hole geometries and configurations. The computational investigation has also been manipulates to provide the physical insight of the aero-thermal interaction of the study. The present study involves thermal and aerodynamic investigations of multiple cooling holes with shallow hole angle. Total of three test models are considered in the present study namely TMA, TMB and TMG. The base line test model; TMB is design to justify the commonly used <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> having 35 " hole angle. The other two test models; TMA and TMG, are having a shallow hole angle of 20 " with different lateral pitch distance of 6 D and 3 D, respectively. Total of twenty conventional cylindrical holes constituting a matrix composed of four rows with five holes in each row. Thermal and aerodynamic investigations are carried out involving all of the test models. The thermal investigations involve temperature measurement of test model surface by infrared thermography; NECIAvio H 2640. The surface temperature is converted to film cooling effectiveness to represent the thermal performance of the given test model. In addition to the surface temperature measurements, the thermal investigations also involve measurement of thermal field downstream of each row <b>cooling</b> <b>hole.</b> The thermal fields are measured by a thermocouple rig which is mounted on a 2 -D traverse system. The traverse system will navigate the rig according to a designated measurement grid to enable thermal field contour plot. 3 -D Laser Doppler Velocimetry has been utilized for the aerodynamic measurements. The laser probes are mounted on a 3 -D traverse system which will navigate the probes according to a designated measurement grid to enable velocity field contour plot. The measurements are carried out at single Reynolds number base on the hole diameter of 6200 at three different blowing ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0. The present study also includes the numerical investigation of the above mentioned cases. Simplified computational domains are constructed to include only single lateral pitch based on the test models. The meshes are generated by ANSYS ICEMCFD ver. 12. The analyses are carried out by ANSYS CFX ver. 12 with the employment of steady and unsteady Reynolds Average Navier Stokes analyses using the shear stress transports turbulence model. The experimental aerodynamic results are presented in the form of contour plot of various variables including film cooling effectiveness, normalized u, v, and w velocities. The velocity distributions show that at BR = 1. 0, the lift-off effects are more apparent in the case of TMB in comparison with the TMA. The vector plots between the two test models also reveals the different in terms of the positioning of the counter rotating vortex core which is observed to be further away from the wall surface in TMB. The velocity plots also reveal that downstream of the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> at the centerline, TMA is having higher streamwise velocity in comparison with TMB. These observations can be directly associated with the different in the inclination angle of the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole.</b> Steeper angle in the case of TMA allowed more streamwise momentum component to be ejected through the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> in comparison with the case of TMB. The computational fluid dynamics investigation also reveals the occurrence of different flow structure inside the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> between TMA and TMB. In the case of TMB, the separation which occurs at the inlet of the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> triggers the formation of counter rotating vortex inside of the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> and persists through the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole.</b> An accomplish counter rotating vortices can be observed at various plane inside the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole.</b> The same observation cannot be made for TMA, where the vector plot reveals that the secondary air which has been separated at the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> inlet then reattached to the downstream wall of the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole.</b> This phenomenon hinders the formation of counter rotating vortex inside of the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> which will only be completed by the cross-flow phenomena after the secondary air exiting the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole.</b> In comparison between TMA and TMG, both the experimental and computational results reveal that the shorter lateral pitch in TMG allows the secondary air to dominate the lateral space between <b>cooling</b> <b>hole.</b> The domination of the secondary air within the lateral space leads to greater blockage not only at the hole vicinity but also at the lateral space. The numerical results also show that the greater blockage which occur in TMG resulting a different interaction between the upcoming and the concurrent vortex cores in comparison with TMA. At wider lateral pitch of TMA, the upcoming vortex cores diffuse directly into the concurrent vortex cores keeping the secondary air in-line. At shorter lateral pitch of TMG, the upcoming vortex cores are deflected in the lateral direction before diffuse at further downstream of the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole.</b> The deflection cause the secondary air to disperses at the lateral space. The velocity plots also confirmed the interaction between the neighboring counter rotating vortices in the case of TMG which hindering it own growth and leads to lesser lift-off effects. The thermal investigations results are presented in terms of the contour plot of film cooling effectiveness, distribution of laterally average film cooling effectiveness and area average film cooling effectiveness along the x-axis. Benchmarking between the present and previous study are made to validate the present measurement and analysis approach. Good agreement has been achieved between the present and previous study. The film cooling effectiveness provided by TMA is higher at all blowing ratio in comparison with TMB particularly at BR= 1. 0 and 2. 0. The thermal fields show that at BR= 1. O, the lift-off effects are more evident in the case of TMB in comparison with TMA. At BR= 2. 0, the thermal fields show complete detachment of the secondary air from the wall for the case of TMB leaving no trace of film cooling coverage on the surface. The thermal fields also indicate a lesser dispersion of the thermal field in the case of TMA in comparison with TMB which can directly be associated with the interaction rate between the secondary air and the mainstream air. In comparison between TMA and TMG, similar distribution of film cooling coverage can be observed downstream the first and second row <b>cooling</b> <b>hole.</b> Downstream the third and fourth row <b>cooling</b> <b>hole,</b> TMG start to provide better film cooling coverage. The contour plot shows an establishment of full coverage film cooling effectiveness region accommodating the lateral space between the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> centerline. This observation serves the flow phenomena which have been describe earlier in the writing. The thermal fields also show the domination of the secondary air in the lateral space which is more apparent downstream of the third and fourth row <b>cooling</b> <b>hole.</b> Conclusions of the present study are summarized as follows; a) shallow hole angle configurations are definitely improving the film cooling coverage in comparison to the commonly used hole angle at 30 " or 35 ". The superiority of the shallow hole angle is more apparent at higher blowing ratio cases in which the cooling protection provided at BR = 2. 0 of shallow hole angle is a match to the result of BR = 2. 0 of the 35 " hole angle; b) at shorter lateral pitch distance, full coverage film cooling effectiveness were prevail indicating the benefit of the interaction between the secondary air of the neighboring cooling holes; c) the superposition effect induces by the in-line hole arrangement of the present study help to improve the film cooling performance with greater benefit were obtained by the shallow hole angle in comparison to the 35 degree hole angle; d) the CFD results confirm the formation of a counter rotating vortex pair inside of the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> which perseveres until downstream of the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> in all cases. Increase in the length of the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> will allow the separated secondary air to reattach thus hindering the formation of the kidney vortices so as to better the film cooling effectiveness in the case of TMA and TMG; e) the domination of the mainstream air at the lateral space between the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> in the case at longer lateral pitch distance kept the secondary jet in-line as it travel towards the downstream direction. It will cause the upcoming vortex core to directly infuses thus amplify the jetting effect of the downstream vortices which will ultimately minimizing the utilization of the secondary air; f) at the shorter lateral pitch distance, the narrow lateral space between the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> enables the secondary air jet to interact with each other and prevent the mainstream air to dominating the lateral space resulting the upcoming vortices to be deflected while it approaching the downstream <b>cooling</b> <b>hole.</b> At the same time, the deflection helps to spread the secondary air laterally hence to better the film cooling effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that the mixing of a film cooling flow with the main turbine passage flow is an {{unsteady}} process, with coherent unsteady features occurring {{across a range of}} blowing ratios. Upon an aero engine the cooling holes on a turbine blade commonly have a crossflow at the hole inlet. Previous work has shown that crossflow at the hole inlet modifies the time-mean flowfield downstream of a <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> compared to the case without crossflow. The current paper investigates the impact of spanwise orientated crossflow on the coherent unsteadiness within film cooling flows. Both cylindrical and fan-shaped holes, located on a blade pressure surface, are studied. The range of blowing ratios considered is 0. 7 to 1. 8 and the crossflow velocity is up to 0. 8 times the bulk jet velocity. High Speed Photography and Hot Wire Anemometry are used to observe the presence of coherent unsteadiness, both immediately downstream of the hole exit and within the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> tube. The results show that the coherent unsteadiness downstream of the hole exit is persistent and its occurrence is not significantly affected by the magnitude of spanwise crossflow.

The first step towards this goal is a benchmark study using direct numerical simulations to consider a single periodic film <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> that characterizes the error in adiabatic boundary conditions, a common numerical simpliflication. Two cases are considered: an adiabatic case and a conjugate case. The adiabatic case is for validation to previous work conducted by Pietrzyk and Peet.

To accomplish this goal, the ADPAC code was modified {{to allow for a}} Cartesian coordinate system capability and to add boundary conditions to handle spanwise periodicity and transpiration boundaries. The primary validation case was the film cooled C 3 X vane. The <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> modeling included both a porous region and grid in each discrete hold.

The experiments investigation for this paper have been performed using a thermal IR camera, and the flow field has been analyzed by numerical calculation using a commercial code (FLUENT) was utilized and the SST k- ω turbulence model. The effect of blowing ratio (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0) and twisted film cooling holes angles (90 °, 180 °, 270 ° and 360 °) were also considered. A duct flow enters into a twisted film <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> in a cross direction. For the corrugation film <b>cooling</b> <b>hole,</b> {{it is observed that}} the reattachment of separated flow and the vortices within the hole enhance considerably the heat/mass transfer around the holes entrance region. Results showed that the twisted film cooling holes performed better than the cylindrical hole. Also, the film cooling effectiveness and heat transfer coefficient for the corrugation holes were strongly affected by the angle of twisted film cooling holes of the corrugation hole. Results show the heat transfer enhancement range of (1. 5 - 2. 7) time of smooth film cooling holes. Experimental and numerical calculation of film cooling effectiveness is validated with pervious experimental result...|$|E
40|$|Local {{and average}} heat {{transfer}} coefficients and friction factors were measured {{in a test}} section simulating the trailing-edge cooling cavity of a turbine airfoil. The test rig with a trapezoidal cross-sectional area was rib-roughened on two {{opposite sides of the}} trapezoid (airfoil pressure and suction sides) with tapered ribs to conform to the cooling cavity shape and had a 22 -degree tilt in the flow direction upstream of the ribs that affected the heat transfer coefficients on the two rib-roughened surfaces. The radial cooling flow traveled from the airfoil root to the tip while exiting through 22 <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> along the airfoil trailing-edge. Two rib geometries, with and without the presence of the trailing-edge <b>cooling</b> <b>holes,</b> were examined. The numerical model contained the entire trailing-edge channel, ribs, and trailing-edge <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> to simulate exactly the tested geometry. A pressure-correction based, multiblock, multigrid, unstructured/adaptive commercial software was used in this investigation. Realizable k-ε turbulence model in conjunction with enhanced wall treatment approach for the near wall regions was used for turbulence closure. The applied thermal boundary conditions to the CFD models matched the test boundary conditions. Comparisons are made between the experimental and numerical results...|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} air-cooled {{turbine blades}} specimens of DD 6 single crystal superalloy with different distributions of <b>cooling</b> film <b>holes</b> {{were used to}} study the high cycle fatigue properties at room temperature. The SEM fracture observation was carried out. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> have significant effects on the high fatigue life of DD 6 single crystal superalloy. The average life of non-hole specimens is four times of that of the three-row holes specimens under the same testing conditions. However, the distribution of <b>cooling</b> film <b>holes</b> has relatively less influence on fatigue life. The fracture of the specimens with non-hole is linear source by SEM analysis, but the cracks are found around the <b>cooling</b> film <b>holes</b> and the fracture of the specimens with single row to three rows is a typical multi-source rupture, and cracks all initiate from near film holes. According to fracture and crystallography theoretical conjecture, the cracks propagate along the { 001 } slip plane for non-hole, single-row holes and the middle location of the multi-row holes specimens. However, the cracks around the holes grow along the { 111 } slip plane for upper and lower holes of the specimens with multi-row holes. In addition, the distribution of stress field along <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> of four different specimens was analysed by FEM method. The results show that the fracture location and morphology of specimens are consistent well with numerical simulation analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a high pressure turbine requires the accurate prediction of flow within and around film cooling holes. However the length scales inherent to film cooling flows produce a large disparity against those of themainstreamflow, hence {{they can not be}} resolved by a mesh generated for an aerodynamics analysis. Furthermore, the process of meshing cooling holes is not only time consuming but cumbersome; thus making the parametric study of film cooling effectiveness for a given blade geometry, using hole geometry and distribution very difficult in a design environment. In this paper an immersed mesh block (IMB) approach is proposedwhich allows the refinedmesh of a <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> to be immersed into the coarser mesh of an NGV and solved simultaneously whilst maintaining mass conservation. By employing two-way coupling, the flow physics in and around cooling holes is able to interact with the mainstream, hence the length scales of both types of flow are appropriately resolved. A generic <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> design can then be mapped to a given aerofoil geometry multiple times to achieve an appropriate distribution of cooling holes. The results show that for a realistic transonic blade, a configuration consisting of up to 200 cooling holes can be efficiently and accurately calculated - whilst retaining the original aerodynamic mesh but with a much enhanced resolution for the film cooling.

The RBNN method is used as an optimization technique with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes analysis of fluid flow and heat transfer with shear stress transport turbulent model. The hole length-to-diameter ratio and injection angle are chosen as design variables and film-cooling effectiveness is considered as objective function {{which is to be}} maximized.

40|$|One {{viable option}} to improve cooling methods used for gas turbine blades is to {{optimize}} the geometry of the film-cooling hole. To optimize that geometry, effects of the hole geometry on the complex jet-in-crossflow interaction need to be understood. This paper presents a comparison of detailed flowfield measurements for three differ-ent single, scaled-up hole geometries, all at a blowing ratio and density ratio of unity. The hole geometries include a round hole, a hole with a laterally expanded exit, and a hole with a forward-laterally expanded exit. In addition to the flowfield measurements for expanded <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> geometries being unique to the literature, the testing facility used for these measurements was also unique in that both the external mainstream Much number (Ma*, = 0. 25) and internal coolant supply Mach number (Mac = 0. 3) were nearly matched. Results show that by expanding the exit of the cooling holes, both the penetration of the cooling jet and the intense shear regions are significantly reduced relative to a round hole. Although the peak turbu-lence level for all three hole geometries was nominally the same, the source of that turbulence was different. The peak turbulence level for both expanded holes was located at the exit of the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> resulting from the expansion angle being too large. The peak turbulence level for the round hole was located downstream of the hole exit where the velocity gradients were very large...|$|E
40|$|Film cooling {{concepts}} {{applied to}} gas turbine vanes were investigated. The filming cooling air was ejected {{from a single}} row of holes on the convex surface and a double row of holes of the concave surface. Tests were conducted at a gas temperature of 1260 K, a gas pressure of 3 atmospheres, and a coolant temperature of 280 K. Mass velocity ratios were varied between 0 and 2. 0. Data were taken without film <b>cooling</b> <b>holes,</b> with film <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> but without blowing, and with blowing. A small amount of blowing into a nonturbulent boundary layer caused an increase in vane temperatures.
