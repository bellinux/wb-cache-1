2500|$|If {{the load}} on a column is applied {{through the center}} of gravity (centroid) of its cross section, it is called an axial load. A load at any other point in the cross section is known as an {{eccentric}} load. A short column under the action of an axial load will fail [...] by direct compression before it buckles, but a long column loaded in the same manner will fail by springing suddenly outward laterally (buckling) in a bending mode. The buckling mode of deflection is considered a failure mode, and it generally occurs before the axial compression stresses (direct compression) can cause failure of the material by yielding or fracture of that <b>compression</b> <b>member.</b> However, intermediate-length columns will fail by a combination of direct compressive stress and bending.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The Southern African Institute of Steel Construction {{expressed}} concern {{with regard to}} the unit definition of the effective length factor, K, stipulated for compressive elements of parallel chord trusses in Clause 15 of SANS 10162 - 1 : 2005 - Limit state design of hot-rolled steelwork. The simplified method for truss design specified in the code assumes all <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> are pin-connected, which allows for greater design simplicity and reduces the amount of code interpretation required by the designer. In addition to this, Clause 15 requires the additional reduction in resistance of the first web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> by a factor of 0. 85. However, this approach may be considered overly conservative and in current design practice the effective length factor is often reduced to less than 1. 0. This research investigates the effective length factor of web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> in parallel chord trusses, by means of investigative structural analyses of representative trusses using ANGELINE and Prokon analytical programs, and by designing, constructing and testing six representative trusses, using current design practices. A comparative study of a number of different countries’ codified approaches to truss design is also included. The structural analyses revealed that in-plane buckling of the web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> was the consistent mode of failure, however at a much greater applied load than the design load determined according to SANS 10162 - 1 : 2005. Contrary to the expected mode of failure, all six tests performed on the representative trusses exhibited elastic out-of-plane buckling, or strongaxis buckling, of the web <b>compression</b> <b>members,</b> but still at a much greater applied load than the design load. The unexpected out-of-plane buckling of the web members is due to the inplane stiffness of the end connections used. In order to stay true to current design practice, gusset plates and longitudinal welds were used to join the web members to the chords. The stiffness of the gusset plates therefore significantly reduced the effective length of the web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> in-plane, but did not reduce the effective length out-of-plane. Despite the unanticipated behaviour of the tests performed, certain conclusions can still be drawn from the results. The unit definition of the effective length factor for in-plane buckling of web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> is too conservative and a K factor of 0. 8 is recommended. In addition to this an effective length factor for out-plane-buckling of web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> of 1. 1 is recommended for trusses with welded connections. The necessity of the reduction in resistance of 0. 85 of the first web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> requires further investigation. The most important conclusion to be drawn is that out-of-plane buckling of web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> can be the dominant failure mode, which is not taken into consideration in current design practice...|$|R

40|$|Cold-formed steel {{members have}} been widely used in {{residential}} and commercial buildings as primary load bearing structural elements. They are often made of thin steel sheets and hence they are more susceptible to local buckling. The buckling behaviour of cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> under fire conditions is not fully investigated yet and hence {{there is a lack of}} knowledge on the fire performance of cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> Current cold-formed steel design standards do not provide adequate design guidelines for the fire design of cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> Therefore a research project based on extensive experimental and numerical studies was undertaken to investigate the local buckling behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> under simulated fire conditions. First a series of 91 local buckling tests was conducted at ambient and uniform elevated temperatures up to 700 oC on cold-formed lipped and unlipped channels. Suitable finite element models were then developed to simulate the behaviour of tested columns and were validated using test results. All the ultimate load capacity results for local buckling were compared with the predictions from the available design rules based on AS/NZS 4600, BS 5950 Part 5, Eurocode 3 Parts 1. 2 and 1. 3 and the direct strength method (DSM), based on which suitable recommendations have been made for the fire design of cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> subject to local buckling at uniform elevated temperatures.

Eurocode 3 Part 1. 2 (2005) recommends the same fire design guidelines for both hot-rolled and cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> subject to flexural-torsional buckling although considerable behavioural differences exist between cold-formed and hot-rolled steel members.

40|$|In this study, the {{structural}} behaviour of cold-formed steel built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> with longitudinal stiffeners was investigated by experiments and numerical simulation. The influence of different screw spacings on the ultimate strengths of built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> was also investigated. In current design specifications, generally {{there are no}} direct and explicit design rules for cold-formed steel built-up sections. Therefore, design rules for built-up open sections and closed sections have been proposed. The test program was conducted for cold-formed steel built-up sections, which were compressed axially between fixed ends with various column lengths ranged from 300 to 3200 mm. Two identical open sections were connected by self-tapping screws to form a built-up section. The material properties and initial geometric imperfections of the test specimens were measured. The experimental investigation consisted of built-up open sections with edge and web stiffeners, and built-up closed sections with inward or outward web stiffeners. In total, 47 specimens were tested with a screw spacing of 100 mm, and another 25 specimens were tested with screw spacings of 300 and 600 mm. A further investigation on {{the structural}} behaviour of cold-formed steel built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> was performed using finite element analysis (FEA). Firstly, accurate and reliable finite element models (FEMs) were developed and verified against the test results. Secondly, extensive parametric studies of cross-section geometry and the screw spacing were {{carried out by the}} verified FEMs. The parametric study contained 442 specimens for built-up open sections, built-up closed sections, and built-up sections with different screw spacings. Therefore, the complex structural behaviour of built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> with edge and web stiffeners, together with different spacings of self-tapping screws were studied thoroughly, as reported in this thesis. The current direct strength method (DSM) is a favored design method for cold-formed steel columns and beams due to its ease of calculation. However, DSM does not cover the design of cold-formed steel built-up sections. The appropriateness of DSM for cold-formed steel built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> was accessed by both experimental and numerical investigation. It was found that the current DSM is not quite suitable for the design of built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> Therefore, the current DSM was modified for built-up open and closed sections. The results show that the modified design rules are generally conservative and reliable for the design of built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> In addition, design recommendations are proposed for built-up sections with different screw spacings.
