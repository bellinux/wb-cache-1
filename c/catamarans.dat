Hovercraft services plied briefly in the late 1990s between the Gateway of India and CBD Belapur in Navi Mumbai. They were subsequently scrapped {{due to lack of}} adequate infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Fast Ferries service began {{initially}} with {{a single}} boat, the 118-passenger Rich Passage 1, in 2017. The vessel is a catamaran designed to create a very low wake while operating at high speeds by employing a special foil. A second boat of a similar design is planned {{be added to the}} Bremerton route in 2019. The agency's plans call for the purchase of a 150-passenger catamaran for delivery in 2018, two 250-passenger bow loading <b>catamarans</b> for delivery in 2020 and 2021, and an additional 118-passenger high-speed, low-wake catamaran to be delivered in 2022.|$|E

5000|$|The C-Class <b>Catamaran</b> is a {{high-performance}} developmental class sailing <b>catamaran.</b> They are very light boats which use rigid wing sails and can sail {{at twice the}} speed of the wind. They are used for match races known as the International <b>Catamaran</b> Challenge Trophy and its successor the International C-Class <b>Catamaran</b> Championship - both {{often referred to as the}} [...] "Little America's Cup".|$|R
25|$|Sailing <b>catamarans</b> {{have been}} noted for {{incorporating}} technological advances over traditional monohull craft. These include foils that lift racing <b>catamarans</b> out of the water, capacious and stable cruising vessels, and racers that have achieved average speeds on the open ocean, comparable to much larger vessels.|$|E
25|$|The Prout Brothers, Roland and Francis, {{experimented with}} <b>catamarans</b> in 1949 and {{converted}} their 1935 boat factory in Canvey Island, Essex (England), to catamaran production in 1954. Their Shearwater <b>catamarans</b> won races easily against the monohulls. Yellow Bird, a 1956-built Shearwater, raced successfully by Francis Prout in the 1960s, {{is in the}} collection of the National Maritime Museum Cornwall.|$|E
25|$|Large {{merchant}} vessels have a FnV {{between one}} and zero, whereas higher-performance powered <b>catamarans</b> may approach 2.5—denoting a higher speed per unit volume for <b>catamarans.</b> Each type of vessel has a corresponding calm water transportation efficiency, with large transport ships being {{in the range of}} 100–1,000, compared with 11-18 for transport catamarans—denoting a higher efficiency per unit of payload for monohulls.|$|E

25|$|Later that century, the American Nathanael Herreshoff {{constructed}} a double-hulled sailing boat {{of his own}} design (US Pat. No. 189,459). The craft, Amaryllis, raced at her maiden regatta on June 22, 1876, and performed exceedingly well. Her debut demonstrated the distinct performance advantages afforded to <b>catamarans</b> over the standard monohulls. It was {{as a result of}} this event, the Centennial Regatta of the New York Yacht Club, that <b>catamarans</b> were barred from regular sailing classes, and this remained the case until the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Wave-piercing <b>catamarans</b> {{employ a}} low-buoyancy bow on each hull that is {{pointed at the}} water line and rises aft, up to a level, to allow each hull to pierce waves, rather than ride over them. This allows higher speeds through waves than for a {{conventional}} catamaran. They are distinguished from SWATH <b>catamarans,</b> in that the buoyant part of the hull is not tubular. The spanning bridge deck may be configured {{with some of the}} characteristics of a normal V-hull, which allows it to penetrate the crests of waves.|$|E

25|$|The Tornado <b>catamaran</b> was {{designed}} by three Englishmen for a crew of two in 1967 as an Olympic <b>catamaran</b> candidate. At the Olympic <b>Catamaran</b> Trials of the International Yacht Racing Union, IYRU, it outperformed the other challengers for the role and was selected for the multihull discipline in the Olympic Games from 1976 through 2008.

25|$|<b>Catamarans</b> {{have two}} {{distinct}} primary performance characteristics that distinguish them from displacement monohull vessels: lower resistance to {{passage through the}} water and greater stability (initial resistance to capsize). Choosing between a monohull and catamaran configuration includes considerations of carrying capacity, speed, and efficiency.|$|E
25|$|At low to {{moderate}} speeds, a lightweight catamaran hull experiences resistance to passage through {{water that is}} approximately proportional to the square of its speed. A displacement monohull, by comparison, experiences resistance that is at least the cube of its speed. This means that a catamaran would require four times the power in order to double its speed, whereas a monohull would require eight times the power to double its speed, starting at a slow speed. For powered <b>catamarans,</b> this implies smaller power plants (although two are typically required). For sailing <b>catamarans,</b> low forward resistance allows the sails to derive power from attached flow, their most efficient mode—analogous to a wing—leading {{to the use of}} wingsails in racing craft.|$|E
25|$|Military Sealift Command {{currently}} operates several Expeditionary Fast Transport <b>catamarans</b> {{which are}} owned by the U.S. Navy. These are employed for the high speed transport of military cargo {{and are able to}} get into shallow ports due to their small draft.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{classical}} approaches using CFD {{software to}} calculate the hydrodynamic performance of <b>catamaran</b> planing vessel still need {{to rely on the}} model test or empirical formula to make sure of the running attitude. So a theoretical calculate method of resistance performance of <b>catamaran</b> planing vessel is proposed in this paper based on RANS equations and the VOF method to couple six degrees of freedom equation of the <b>catamaran</b> planing vessel. Numerical simulation results indicate that using RANS equations can better forecast hydrodynamic performance of <b>catamaran</b> planing vessel at high speed, which provides a practicable numerical method for optimization design of the <b>catamaran</b> planing vessel’s hull...|$|R

5000|$|In modern sailing, {{the term}} is {{sometimes}} {{used to refer to}} the outrigger on a proa or trimaran, or the two sections of a <b>catamaran.</b> [...] However, calling the two sections of a <b>catamaran</b> by the word ama, is not technically correct since they are of equal size. A <b>catamaran</b> is technically a wa'a wa'a or double canoe connected by an aka.|$|R
25|$|<b>Catamarans</b> {{range in}} size from small (sailing or rowing vessels) to large (naval ships and car ferries). The {{structure}} connecting a catamaran's two hulls ranges from a simple frame strung with webbing to support the crew to a bridging superstructure incorporating extensive cabin and/or cargo space.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} problem of inland {{waterways}} fisheries is the transportation of fish from ponds to fish market during low tide trough inland waterways with 0. 6 m water depth. The boat is experiences grounding due to water depth of the river is not sufficient for the fishing boat to carry fish at it’s maximum 2 tones capacity or experience dead freight. This condition forces fisherman {{to wait until the}} high tide from the sea, this delay causes the quality of the fish is decreasing. Besides the problem dead freight  problem the existing vessel is causes environmental problem such as erosion of the river bank due to wake wash. The other important issue is the increases of fuel price and it’s scarcity.   This paper presents the results of comparison of existing monohull fishing boat and two other alternativecatamaran designs. The <b>catamaran</b> design alternatives are is ordinary <b>catamaran</b> and flat side <b>catamaran.</b>  Both of the <b>catamaran</b> fishing boat design shows that the <b>catamaran</b> boat with 0. 5 m draft is able to carry more than 2 tonnes payload during low tide water depth.   The CFD simulation results shows that flat side <b>catamaran</b> resistance is more than 17. 7 % lower compared to ordinary <b>catamaran</b> and 44 % lower compared to monohull. It means that the consumption of flat side <b>catamaran</b> is lowest compared to two other type of hull design. The flat side <b>catamaran</b> also produces lowest wake wash compared to o two other design. The low wake wash means more friendly to environment...|$|R
