The patient had no open speech discrimination, even with hearing aids, and is depending on lip reading for communication. METHODS To evaluate the possible efficiency of a cochlear implantation, we investigated hemodynamic responses within the central auditory pathways using an auditory {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} paradigm. RESULTS Blood oxygen level-dependent correlates were detected bilaterally along the auditory pathways after exposure to intermittent <b>clicking</b> <b>tone</b> stimulation at 2 kHz.

40|$|Otoacoustic {{emissions}} (OAEs) {{are useful}} for studying medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferents, but several unresolved methodological issues cloud {{the interpretation of the}} data they produce. Most efferent assays use a “probe stimulus” to produce an OAE and an “elicitor stimulus” to evoke efferent activity and thereby change the OAE. However, little attention has been given to whether the probe stimulus itself elicits efferent activity. In addition, most studies use only contralateral (re the probe) elicitors and do not include measurements to rule out middle-ear muscle (MEM) contractions. Here we describe methods to deal with these problems and present a new efferent assay based on stimulus frequency OAEs (SFOAEs) that incorporates these methods. By using a postelicitor window, we make measurements in individual subjects of efferent effects from contralateral, ipsilateral, and bilateral elicitors. Using our SFOAE assay, we demonstrate that commonly used probe sounds (<b>clicks,</b> <b>tone</b> pips, and tone pairs) elicit efferent activity, by themselves. Thus, results of efferent assays using these probe stimuli can be confounded by unwanted efferent activation. In contrast, the single 40 dB SPL tone used as the probe sound for SFOAE-based measurements evoked little or no efferent activity. Since they evoke efferent activation, <b>clicks,</b> <b>tone</b> pips, and tone pairs can be used in an adaptation efferent assay, but such paradigms are limited in measurement scope compared to paradigms that separate probe and elicitor stimuli. Finally, we describe tests to distinguish middle-ear muscle (MEM) effects from MOC effects for a number of OAE assays and show results from SFOAE-based tests. The SFOAE assay used in this study provides a sensitive, flexible, frequency-specific assay of medial efferent activation that uses a low-level probe sound that elicits little or no efferent activity, and thus provides results that can be interpreted without the confound of unintended efferent activation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} noise wave {{is the key to}} effective noise control in a tunnel. In this paper, an IP based audio test network is presented. This network includes 100 battery powered recorders and a WIFI network. Each recorder can acquire 2 channels of audio waves and be triggered by external signals of infrared or electrical synchronic pulse. A main control computer connects these recorders to setup parameters and collect data via the WIFI network. Sensors are reassembled to be compatible with the interface of standard sound source. Meanwhile each sensor is fixed in a sensor holder, which can be placed to any position on a plane and can be used to adjust its sensor to 0 - 180 degrees in both of X-Y direction. The sound source generates various signals, such as <b>clicks,</b> <b>tones,</b> and tone bursts, to help understand how the sound propagates in tunnels.

40|$|Middle-latency {{auditory}} components (MLC) {{in response}} to <b>clicks</b> and <b>tone</b> pips have been recorded in 20 normal subjects, aged between 26 and 32 years, in order to verify their reliability {{in response to}} frequency-specific stimuli (0. 5 and 1 kHz). The results indicate a good reliability of MLC obtained when using tone pips. The responses show the conventionally labeled Po, Na, Nb, Pb waves. The latencies of these waves tend to be greater {{than those of the}} corresponding waves elicited by clicks and their amplitudes are smaller. This is probably due to an asynchrony of the responses. The Po and Pa waves are the most resistant to decreasing stimulus intensity, as both are clearly detectable down to 20 dB nHL, but Po is the best threshold index because at 20 dB it has a more clear-cut shape than Pa. According to the latency values obtained for MLC elicited by both <b>clicks</b> and <b>tone</b> pips, the Po wave is probably generated at the inferior colliculus level. The latency shift towards the click-elicited Jewett wave V is mainly due to the different filter settings employed. The morphology of MLC elicited by tone pips is less affected by changes in stimulus frequency than that of corresponding auditory brainstem responses.

40|$|Abstract Background Auditory {{brainstem}} responses (ABRs) {{are used}} to study auditory acuity in animal-based medical research. ABRs are evoked by acoustic stimuli, and consist of an electrical signal resulting from summated activity in the auditory nerve and brainstem nuclei. ABR analysis determines the sound intensity at which a neural response first appears (hearing threshold). Traditionally, threshold has been assessed by visual estimation {{of a series of}} ABRs evoked by different sound intensities. Here we develop an automated threshold detection method that eliminates the variability and subjectivity associated with visual estimation. Results The automated method is a robust computational procedure that detects the sound level at which the peak amplitude of the evoked ABR signal first exceeds four times the standard deviation of the baseline noise. Implementation of the procedure was achieved by evoking ABRs in response to <b>click</b> and <b>tone</b> stimuli, under normal and experimental conditions (adult stem cell transplantation into cochlea). Automated detection revealed that the threshold shift from pre- to post-surgery hearing levels was similar in mice receiving stem cell transplantation or sham injection for <b>click</b> and <b>tone</b> stimuli. Visual estimation by independent observers corroborated these results but revealed variability in ABR threshold shifts and significance levels for stem cell-transplanted and sham-injected animals. Conclusion In summary, the automated detection method avoids the subjectivity of visual analysis and offers a rapid, easily accessible [URL] approach to measure hearing threshold levels in auditory brainstem response. </p...|$|R

40|$|Besides the {{intensity}} and frequency of an auditory stimulus, {{the length of time}} that precedes the stimulation is an important factor that determines the magnitude of early evoked neural responses in the auditory cortex. Here we used chinchillas to demonstrate that the length of the silent period before the presentation of an auditory stimulus is a critical factor that modifies late oscillatory responses in the auditory cortex. We used tetrodes to record local-field potential (LFP) signals from the left auditory cortex of ten animals while they were stimulated with <b>clicks,</b> <b>tones</b> or noise bursts delivered at different rates and intensity levels. We found that the incidence of oscillatory activity in the auditory cortex of anesthetized chinchillas is dependent on the period of silence before stimulation and on {{the intensity}} of the auditory stimulus. In 62. 5 % of the recordings sites we found stimulus-related oscillations at around 8 - 20 Hz. Stimulus-induced oscillations were largest and consistent when stimuli were preceded by 5 s of silence and they were absent when preceded by less than 500 ms of silence. These results demonstrate that the period of silence preceding the stimulus presentation and the stimulus intensity are critical factors for the presence of these oscillations.

40|$|The {{auditory}} brainstem response (ABR) {{was recorded}} in adult budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) in response to <b>clicks</b> and <b>tones.</b> The typical budgerigar ABR waveform showed two prominent peaks occurring within 4 ms of the stimulus onset. As sound-pressure levels increased, ABR peak latency decreased, and peak amplitude increased for all waves while interwave interval remained relatively constant. While ABR thresholds were about 30 dB higher than behavioral thresholds, {{the shape of the}} budgerigar audiogram derived from the ABR closely paralleled that of the behavioral audiogram. Based on the ABR, budgerigars hear best between 1000 and 5700 Hz with best sensitivity at 2860 Hz-the frequency corresponding to the peak frequency in budgerigar vocalizations. The latency of ABR peaks increased and amplitude decreased with increasing repetition rate. This rate-dependent latency increase is greater for wave 2 as indicated by the latency increase in the interwave interval. Generally, changes in the ABR to stimulation intensity, frequency, and repetition rate are comparable to what has been found in other vertebrates...|$|R

40|$|Between one {{and three}} of every 1, 000 {{neonates}} have sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). It is of utmost importance to minimize the duration of auditory deprivation between the onset of bilateral deafness and intervention using hearing devices such as hearing aids and cochlear implants for achieving the best speech percpetion ability. To fit amplification accurately for children with SNHL, hearing thresholds for frequencies {{in the range of}} human communica-tion should be evaluated. However, infants and young children are difficult to test using con-ventional behavioral tests, and hearing thresholds of them can be predicted using auditory brainstem response (ABR) and auditory steady-state response (ASSR). ABR is best evoked by applying a click stimulus, which allows an estimate over a broad range of high frequen-cies. ABR elicited by tone burst stimulus provides frequency-specific audiometric informa-tion. However, {{it can be difficult to}} record and observe at near-threshold levels, especially at lower frequencies. ABR thresholds for <b>click</b> and <b>tone</b> burst stimuli are highly correlated with behavioral thresholds, and often give an idea of the shape of an audiogram.

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to assess saccular function through use of the cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP). The cVEMP response is a middle latency (P1 between 12-20 ms) waveform denoting inhibition of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle ipsilateral to the stimulus. While not truly a unilateral reflex (response waveforms can be detected in the SCM contralateral to the stimulus in approximately 40% of cases), cVEMPs are more unilateral than the closely related ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP). The most reliable points on the cVEMP waveform are known as P1 and N1. Of all waveform characteristics, P1-N1 amplitude is the most reliable and clinically relevant. cVEMP amplitude is linearly dependent upon stimulus intensity and is most reliably elicited with a loud (generally at or above 95 dB nHL) <b>click</b> or <b>tone</b> burst. The cVEMP can also {{be said to be}} low-frequency tuned, with largest amplitudes in response to 500-750 Hz tonebursts.

40|$|The {{temporal}} {{envelope of}} sound strongly influences the intelligibility of speech, pattern analysis, and the grouping of sequential stimuli. This thesis examined the coding of sound temporal envelope in the time-patterns of population neural {{activity of the}} human auditory pathway. Traditional microelectrode recordings capture the fine time-pattern of neural spiking in individual neurons, but do not necessarily provide a good assay of temporal coding in neural populations. In contrast, {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), the technique chosen for the present study, provides an indicator of population activity over a time-scale of seconds, with the added advantage that it can be used routinely in human listeners. In a first study, it was established that the time-pattern of cortical activity is heavily influenced by sound repetition rate, whereas the time-pattern of subcortical activity is not. In the inferior colliculus, activity to prolonged noise burst trains (30 s) increased with increasing rate (2 /s - 35 /s), but was always sustained throughout the train. In contrast, the most striking sound rate dependence of auditory cortex was seen in the time-pattern of activity. Low rates elicited sustained activity, whereas high rates elicited "phasic" activity, characterized by strong adaptation early in the train and a robust response to train offset. These results for auditory cortex suggested that certain sound temporal envelope characteristics are encoded over multiple seconds in the time-patterns of cortical population activity. A second study tested this idea more fully by using a wider variety of sounds (e. g., speech, music, <b>clicks,</b> <b>tones)</b> and by systematically varying different sound features. (cont.) Important for this test was {{the development of a new}} set of basis functions for use in a general linear model that enabled the detection and quantification of the full range of cortical activity patterns. This study established that the time-pattern of cortical activity is strongly dependent on sound temporal envelope, but not sound level or bandwidth. Namely, as either rate or sound-time fraction increases, the time-pattern shifts from sustained to phasic. Thus, shifts in the time-pattern of cortical activity from sustained to phasic signal subsecond differences in sound temporal envelope. These shifts may be fundamental to the perception of successive acoustic transients as either distinct or grouped acoustic events. by Michael Patrick Harms. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Psychoacoustic tests revealed a marked impairment of those auditory perceptions dependent on temporal cues, that is, lateralization of binaural clicks, change of binaural masked threshold with changes in signal phase, binaural beats, detection of paired monaural clicks, monaural detection of a silent gap in a sound, and monaural threshold elevation for short duration tones. In contrast, auditory functions reflecting intensity or frequency discriminations (difference limens) were only minimally impaired. Pure tone audiometry showed a moderate (50 dB) bilateral hearing loss with a disproportionate severe loss of word intelligibility. Those auditory evoked potentials that were preserved included (1) cochlear microphonics reflecting hair cell activity; (2) cortical sustained potentials reflecting processing of slowly changing signals; and (3) long-latency cognitive components (P 300, processing negativity) reflecting endogenous auditory cognitive processes.

Response to the vowel portion elicited a frequency following response (FFR). The FFR further showed a coding of the fundamental frequency (F 0) and the first formant frequency (F 1). The results of the present study throw light on the processing of speech in brainstem. The understanding of speech evoked ABR has other applications both in research as well as in clinical purposes. Such understanding is specially important if one is interested in studying the central auditory system function...|$|R
40|$|A adequação do peso ao nascimento é um fator de risco para atrasos de desenvolvimento. Dentre outras causas de morbidade e mortalidade, encontra-se a prematuridade e a Restrição de Crescimento Intrauterino (RCIU). O termo P̈equeno para a Idade Gestacional(̈PIG) é utilizado muitas vezes, como indicador de RCIU, cujo feto pode ter sido submetido a agravos em diferentes momentos da gestação. A {{literatura}} aponta o PIG como risco para atraso no desenvolvimento neuropsicomotor, incluindo a linguagem. Objetivo: Acompanhar a maturação da via auditiva em lactentes nascidos PIG, comparando-os aos lactentes nascidos Adequados para Idade Gestacional (AIG) a termo e pré-termo, por meio do estudo das respostas do PEATE por estímulo <b>click</b> e <b>tone</b> burst (TB) nos seis primeiros meses de vida. Método: Estudo longitudinal, observacional de caráter multicêntrico. Foram avaliados 172 lactentes nascidos PIG e AIG, a termo e pré-termo, nos períodos neonatal, aos três e aos seis meses, por meio do PEATE com estímulo tipo <b>click</b> e <b>tone</b> burst em 0, 5 kHz e 1 kHz, a 80 dBnNA. Resultados: no período neonatal, os RN T/PIG não se diferenciaram dos RN T/AIG quanto às respostas do PEATE, o mesmo ocorrendo entre PT/PIG e PT/AIG. Ao se comparar o grupo T e PT/PIG, observou-se diferença entre as latências das ondas III, V e intervalos interpicos (Itpc) I-III e I-V, com latências maiores nos PT/PIG; não foram evidenciadas diferenças com TB nas frequências avaliadas. Na comparação do grupo T e PT/AIG, observou-se diferença entre as latências das ondas III, V e nos Itpc III-V e I-V e latências maiores nos PT/AIG. Não houve diferenças no TB nas frequências avaliadas. Aos três meses, não houve diferenças entre os T/PIG e T/AIG; na comparação PT/PIG e PT/AIG, houve diferenças no Itpc III-V, com latência menor no grupo PT/PIG. Não houve diferenças entre T/PIG e PT/PIG; o grupo AIG mostrou diferença entre T e PT nas latências da onda V e Itpc I-V. Na terceira coleta, aos seis meses, os T/PIG e T/AIG evidenciaram diferenças significativas entre as latências da onda III e Itpc I-III, o mesmo não ocorrendo quando se comparou PT/PIG e PT/AIG, os quais se diferenciaram somente no Itpc III-V. Ao se comparar T/PIG e PT/PIG, verificou-se diferenças relevantes somente no TB 0, 5 kHz. Conclusão: Os achados do presente estudo permitiram concluir que o processo maturacional da via auditiva em lactentes nascidos PIG ocorre em diferente velocidade quando comparado ao de lactentes AIG; os PIG têm maturação acelerada, principalmente nos três primeiros meses, caracterizando desta forma um período de recuperação do ponto de vista da audição; a prematuridade influencia mais a maturação do sistema nervoso auditivo central que o fator peso ao nascer no período neonatal; a maturação ocorreu no sentido caudo-rostral nos dois grupos. O PEATE com TB em 0, 5 kHz e em 1 kHz evidenciou o processo maturacional, porém não de modo tão detalhado quanto o fez com o estímulo tipo click. As crianças PIG devem ser monitoradas até pelo menos os três anos de idadeThe {{appropriateness of}} weight at birth {{is a risk}} factor for developmental delays. Prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are among other causes of morbidity and mortality. The term s̈mall for gestational age(̈SGA) is often used as an indicator of IUGR, when the fetus may have been subjected to restrictions at different periods of pregnancy. The literature points SGA as a risk for neuropsychological developmental delay, including language. Objective: to monitor the maturation of the auditory pathway in SGA infants, comparing to term and preterm appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants, through the analysis of the ABR responses to <b>click</b> and <b>tone</b> burst stimulus {{in the first six months}} of life. Method: A longitudinal, observational and multicenter study was conducted. A total of 172 SGA and AGA infants, term and preterm, were evaluated in the neonatal period and at three and six months of age through the ABR with <b>click</b> and <b>tone</b> burst stimulus with 0. 5 kHz and 1 kHz at 80 dBHL. Results: in the neonatal period, the term SGA infants did not differ from term AGA infants for ABR responses. The same was observed between preterm SGA and preterm AGA infants. When comparing the term and preterm SGA groups, there was a difference between the latencies of waves III, V and interpeak intervals (lTPI) I-III and I-V, with longer latencies in preterm SGA; there were no differences with the tone burst stimuli in the analyzed frequencies. When comparing the AGA term and preterm groups, differences were observed on latencies of waves III, V and ITPI III-V and I-V, with longer latencies for preterm infants. There were no differences in the frequencies evaluated with the tone burst stimuli. At three months of age, there were no differences between the term SGA and AGA; when comparing preterm SGA and AGA, differences were found for ITPI III-V, with shorter latencies in preterm SGA. SGA term and preterm infants did not differ; there were differences between term and preterm AGA in latencies of wave V and ITPI I-V. In the third data collection, at six months of age, term SGA and AGA infants significantly differed on latencies of wave III and ITPI I-III, which did not occur when comparing preterm SGA and AGA infants, who differed only regarding ITPI III-V. Significant differences were only observed when comparing term and preterm SGA infants regarding the tone burst stimuli at 0. 5 kHz. Conclusion: The findings of this study showed that the maturational process of the auditory pathway in SGA infants occurs at different speed when compared to AGA infants; SGA infants have accelerated maturation, especially in the first three months of age, thus characterizing a recovery period from the hearing standpoint; in the neonatal period, the maturation of the central auditory nervous system is more influenced by prematurity than birth weight; maturation occurred in caudo-rostral direction in the two groups. The ABR with tone burst at 0. 5 kHz and 1 kHz evidenced maturational process, but not in such detail as with the click stimuli. The SGA infants should be monitored until at least three years of ag...|$|R
40|$|How do {{cortical}} neurons {{represent the}} acoustic environment? This question is often addressed by probing with simple stimuli such as <b>clicks</b> or <b>tone</b> pips. Such stimuli {{have the advantage}} of yielding easily interpreted answers, but have the disadvantage that they may fail to uncover complex or higher-order neuronal response properties. Here we adopt an alternative approach, probing neuronal responses with complex acoustic stimuli, including animal vocalizations and music. We have used in vivo whole cell methods in the rat auditory cortex to record subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations elicited by these stimuli. Whole cell recording reveals the total synaptic input to a neuron from all the other neurons in the circuit, instead of just its output - a sparse binary spike train - as in conventional single unit physiological recordings. Whole cell recording thus provides a much richer source of information about the neuron's response. Many neurons responded robustly and reliably to the complex stimuli in our ensemble. Here we analyze the linear component - the spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF) - of the transformation from the sound (as represented by its time-varying spectrogram) to the neuron's membrane potential. We find that the STRF has a rich dynamical structure, including excitatory regions positioned in general accord with the prediction of the simple tuning curve. We also find that in many cases, much of the neuron's response, although deterministically related to the stimulus, cannot be predicted by the linear component, indicating the presence of as-yet-uncharacterized nonlinear response properties...|$|R
40|$|To {{discover}} the developmental {{relationship between the}} auditory brainstem response (ABR) and the focal inferior colliculus (IC) response, 32 young tammar wallabies were used, by the application of simultaneous ABR and focal brainstem recordings, in response to acoustic <b>clicks</b> and <b>tone</b> bursts of seven frequencies. The IC of the tammar wallaby undergoes a rapid functional development from postnatal day (PND) 114 to 160. The earliest (PND 114) auditory evoked response was recorded from the rostral IC. With development, more caudal parts of the IC became functional until age about PND 127, when {{all parts of the}} IC were responsive to sound. Along a dorsoventral direction, the duration of the IC response decreased, the peak latency shortened, while the amplitude increased, reaching a maximum value at the central IC, then decreased. After PND 160, the best frequency (BF) of the ventral IC was the highest, with values between 12. 5 and 16 kHz, the BF of the dorsal IC was the lowest, varying between 3. 2 and 6. 4 kHz, while the BF of the central IC was between 6. 4 and 12. 5 kHz. Between PND 114 and 125, the IC response did not have temporal correlation with the ABR. Between PND 140 and 160, only the early components of the responses from the ventral and central IC correlated with the P 4 waves of the ABR. After PND 160, responses recorded from different depths of the IC had a temporal correlation with the ABR. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary The {{effect of}} {{traction}} {{injury to the}} eighth nerve on the compound action potentials (CAPs) recorded from the exposed nerve in response to tonebursts and click sounds was compared to responses elicited by continuous tones and noise that were amplitude-modulated with pseudorandom noise. Responses to the continuous sounds were presented {{in the form of}} cross-correlo-grams between the averaged response, with the averager locked to the periodicity of the noise and one period of the noise. While the wave form of these cross-correlograms was similar to the wave form of the response to the same, but unmodulated, stimulus when presented in short bursts when the nerve was intact, these two measures changed in different ways as a result of slight injury to the nerve. Thus, the N ~ peak of the CAP in response to <b>clicks</b> and <b>tones</b> or noisebursts became prolonged when the nerve was stretched, while the first peak in the cross-correlograms was essentially unchanged. The second peak in the cross-correlogram was obliterated, but the N 2 peak in the CAP was clearly present, although attenuated. More severe injury resulting in a nearly total conduction block, however, produced similar changes in the CAPs and cross-correlograms. Key words: Auditory nerve; Nerve injury; Compound action potentials; Cross-correlation; Pseudorandom noise In previous studies we correlated changes in auditory nerve compound action potentials (CAPs) caused by slight injury to the auditory nerve in dogs (Sekiya and Moller 1987 a) and monkey...|$|R
