5|$|By 9 March 2009 The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimated}} that 4,011 people had {{succumbed to the}} waterborne disease since the outbreak began in August 2008, and {{the total number of}} cases recorded had reached 89,018. In Harare, the city council offered free graves to cholera victims. There had been signs that the disease is abating, with cholera infections down by about 50% to around 4,000 <b>cases</b> <b>a</b> week.|$|E
5|$|For instance, pure diamond is an {{electrical}} insulator, but diamond with boron added is {{an electrical}} conductor (and, in some <b>cases,</b> <b>a</b> superconductor), {{allowing it to}} be used in electronic applications. Nitrogen impurities hinder movement of lattice dislocations (defects within the crystal structure) and put the lattice under compressive stress, thereby increasing hardness and toughness.|$|E
5|$|Health {{professionals}} are often involved in Egypt, Kenya, Indonesia and Sudan. In Egypt 77 percent of FGM procedures, and in Indonesia over 50 percent, were performed by medical professionals as of 2008 and 2016. Women in Egypt reported in 1995 that a local anaesthetic {{had been used}} on their daughters in 60 percent of <b>cases,</b> <b>a</b> general anaesthetic in 13 percent and neither in 25 percent (two percent were missing/don't know).|$|E

5|$|In some rare <b>cases,</b> <b>a</b> single {{amino acid}} {{change in a}} serpin's RCL alters its {{specificity}} to target the wrong protease. For example, the Antitrypsin-Pittsburgh mutation (M358R) causes the α1-antitrypsin serpin to inhibit thrombin, causing a bleeding disorder.|$|E
5|$|Internet venues {{unrelated}} to medical issues {{have also been}} the audience for such <b>cases.</b> <b>A</b> member of an online fan club for the musical Rent divulged numerous illnesses that caused her to slip {{in and out of}} comas, prompting some cast members to send sympathy cards. When other fan club members expressed their concern, even purchasing airline tickets to visit the sick woman, she reported that she had immediately improved.|$|E

5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} <b>cases,</b> <b>a</b> latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E
5|$|Some nectar-feeding {{birds are}} {{important}} pollinators, and many frugivores {{play a key}} role in seed dispersal. Plants and pollinating birds often coevolve, and in some <b>cases</b> <b>a</b> flower's primary pollinator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar.|$|E
5|$|Theorists {{also try}} to {{generate}} or modify models {{to take into account}} new data. In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data. In some <b>cases,</b> <b>a</b> large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.|$|E

5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach {{all the way to the}} bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some <b>cases</b> <b>a</b> sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E
5|$|A monarch is {{the head}} of a monarchy, a form of {{government}} in which a state or polity is ruled by an individual who normally rules for life or until abdication, and typically inherits the throne by birth. Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) or may be ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers at all, with actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many <b>cases,</b> <b>a</b> monarch will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only have a single monarch at any given time, although a regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.|$|E
5|$|A {{river is}} a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few <b>cases,</b> <b>a</b> river simply flows into the ground or dries up {{completely}} before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river {{is said to be}} larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language. A river is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).|$|E

He opens <b>a</b> double bass <b>case,</b> <b>a</b> cello <b>case,</b> <b>a</b> viola <b>case,</b> <b>a</b> violin <b>case,</b> and finally <b>a</b> violin.

5|$|Almost {{every nation}} has {{associated}} blood drinking {{with some kind}} of revenant or demon, or in some <b>cases</b> <b>a</b> deity. In India, for example, tales of vetālas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the Baitāl Pacīsī; a prominent story in the Kathāsaritsāgara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. Piśāca, the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{mutations}} {{that change}} protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have benefits. These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these <b>cases</b> <b>a</b> mutation {{will tend to}} become more common in a population through natural selection. Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive responses. In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, E. coli, multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. This phenomenon is called clonal interference and causes competition among the mutations.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the regular}} courts handled {{political}} cases and even issued death sentences for these <b>cases,</b> <b>a</b> {{new type of}} court, the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court), was established in 1934 to deal with politically important matters. This court handed out over 5,000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945. The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist, printing seditious leaflets or even making jokes about Hitler or other top party officials. Nazi Germany employed three types of capital punishment: hanging, decapitation and death by shooting. The Gestapo {{was in charge of}} investigative policing to enforce National Socialist ideology as they located and confined political offenders, Jews and others deemed undesirable. Political offenders who were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by the Gestapo and confined in a concentration camp.|$|E

5|$|Batman: The Ultimate Evil {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Andrew Vachss and {{published}} in 1995 by the Warner Aspect imprint of Warner Books. Vachss was an attorney specializing in child abuse cases, {{as well as a}} crime novelist best known for his series of books featuring the character Burke, a private investigator who also takes on child abuse <b>cases.</b> <b>A</b> representative from DC Comics approached Vachss about the possibility of writing a novel featuring Batman. Viewing {{this as an opportunity to}} reach a completely different audience, Vachss agreed and wrote a draft. He continued with his themes concerning child sexual abuse and explored the topic of child sex tourism. The publisher required Vachss to follow certain rules, like making a clear distinction between fiction and reality and prohibiting the Batman character from killing, cursing, or having sex.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the obvious}} honour, the award also carries a cash {{allowance}} for those under {{the rank of}} lieutenant (or the appropriate service equivalent), and in some <b>cases</b> <b>a</b> cash award. Upon {{the death of the}} recipient, the pension is transferred to the widow until her death or remarriage. In the case of a posthumous recipient who is a bachelor, the allowance is paid to his father or mother. In the case of the award being conferred posthumously on a widower, the allowance is to be paid to his son or unmarried daughter. A monthly stipend of 10,000 rupees is given the awardee. The award amount and pension benefits are exempted from income tax. In addition, different ministries under the Central Government have various awards for PVC winners.|$|E
5|$|Compatibility {{tests as}} well as {{molecular}} analysis indicated that A.areolatum separated very early from other Amylostereum fungi. The other three species separated later {{from each other and}} are thus partially compatible to each other. A.ferreum and A.laevigatum produced in 59% of all <b>cases</b> <b>a</b> common mycelium, A.ferreum and A.chailletii only in 44%. There is an undescribed species in Amylostereum; according to DNA analysis, it stands between A.laevigatum and A.ferreum. This is remarkable, as these fungi originated from Mycetangae (storing organs of Platypodinae) of a North American wood wasp, while A.laevigatum has never been seen as symbiont of wood wasps, neither in North American nor in Europe. The fungus possibly represents a separated species or a subtaxon of A.laevigatum. As A.areolatum and A.chailletii mainly reproduce asexually through the symbiosis of wood wasps, the genetic variability within these species is relatively low.|$|E
