40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{describe}} {{a method of}} using <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> for automatic doc- ument grouping. <b>Associative</b> <b>networks</b> are networks of ideas or concepts in which each concept is linked to concepts that are semantically similar to it. By activating concepts in the network based on the text of a document and spreading this activation to related con- cepts, we can determine which concepts {{are related to the}} document, even if the document itself does not contain words linked directly to those concepts. Based on this information, we can group documents by the concepts they refer to. In {{the first part of the}} thesis we describe the method itself, as well as the details of various algorithms used in the implementation. We additionally discuss the theory upon which the method is based and compare it to various related methods. In the second part of the thesis we evaluate techniques to create <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> from easily accessible knowledge sources, as well as different methods for the training of the <b>associative</b> <b>network.</b> Additionally, we evaluate techniques to improve the extraction of concepts from documents, we compare methods of spreading activation from concept to concept, and we present a novel technique by which the extracted concepts can be used to categorize documents. We also extend the method of <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> to enable application to multilingual document libraries and compare the method to other state-of- the-art methods for document grouping. Finally, we present a practical application of <b>associative</b> <b>networks,</b> as implemented in a corporate environment in the form of the Pagelink Knowledge Centre.

This article then argues that these networks may differ from one individual to another, depending on the cultural background and/or the experience with the brand. Accordingly, the author introduces a methodology of clustering consumers with similar perceptions into distinct segments, which can be targeted differently.

40|$|Concern about {{unethical}} {{behavior in}} the business world has moved many business colleges to examine the coverage of ethics in their coursework. Though some people think ethics cannot be effectively taught in college curricula because of a belief that ethics are formed by one’s upbringing, family and social influences, this study shows that ethical perceptions, as meas-ured in <b>associative</b> <b>networks,</b> can change after presenting information and having instructor-led discussion of ethical issues. Pathfinder analysis used in this study generates an <b>associative</b> or cognitive <b>network</b> for individuals and for group averages.

40|$|Many {{repositories}} are {{burdened by}} resources {{that have an}} incomplete metadata record. With some institutional repositories storing {{hundreds of millions of}} resources, it is extremely costly to manually generate resource metadata. Therefore, automatic metadata generation is a topic of interest to the digital library community. The automatic metadata generation system proposed by this paper is novel in three ways: it is computationally inexpensive, does not require the raw resource, and is independent of the resource media type (i. e. audio, video, document, etc.). Using occurrence and co-occurrence network generation algorithms, an <b>associative</b> <b>network</b> of repository resources is constructed using pre-existing repository metadata. The <b>associative</b> <b>network</b> serves as the substrate which allows metadata-rich resources to supply metadata-limited resources with potentially useful metadata information.

40|$|Abstract A {{multi-agent system}} {{designed}} to observe and remember patterns of co-occurrences in an open, dynamic system is described. The agents are organized according to function, with the low-level agents storing observed cooccurrences of key concepts or events in memory until being recycled for further service, thus simulating fixed short-term memory. The mid-level agents retain a short history (the length of this history {{is determined by the}} number of low-level agents available) of co-occurrence phenomena. The high-level executive agent computes three different, related <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> as a graphical representation of the co-occurrences recorded by means of cumulative consensus of the mid-level agents and responds to queries. Thus the CONSMAG system effects a transformation from episodic memory to a class of <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> representative of semantic memory. This learning paradigm supports cost estimates for learning any given <b>associative</b> <b>network,</b> including modification of one network into another, to simulate a novice becoming an expert...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} its {{tremendous}} value, metadata is generally sparse and incomplete, thereby hampering the effectiveness of digital information services. Many of the existing mechanisms for the automated creation of metadata rely primarily on content analysis which can be costly and inefficient. The automatic metadata generation system proposed in this article leverages resource relationships generated from existing metadata as a medium for propagation from metadata-rich to metadata-poor resources. Because of its independence from content analysis, it {{can be applied to}} a wide variety of resource media types and is shown to be computationally inexpensive. The proposed method operates through two distinct phases. Occurrence and co-occurrence algorithms first generate an <b>associative</b> <b>network</b> of repository resources leveraging existing repository metadata. Second, using the <b>associative</b> <b>network</b> as a substrate, metadata associated with metadata-rich resources is propagated to metadata-poor resources by means of a discrete-form spreading activation algorithm.

40|$|This study {{specifically}} {{addresses the}} question of how <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> contribute to brand image perception measurement to segment the market more effectively, as well as to demonstrate brand image impairment. Carried out using surveys and experimental designs, this dissertation is positioned as part of the research stream on the use of <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> in marketing, and particularly consumer mapping. Firstly, this study provides clear arguments for using brand concept maps (BCM) as highly suitable method to capture the complete brand image and segment the market based on brand perception. Secondly, thanks to BCM, the present research provide empirical evidences on the likelihood of brand image confusion, namely the dilution of attributes and the creation of unattractive associations, {{as a result of the}} introduction of a new brand. Thirdly, BCM captures the effect of exposure to negative user-generated content on the likelihood of doppelganger brand image, namely the appearance, or reinforcement, of negative associations at the brand reputation level. This work reveals that BCM is a superior approach to measure brand image and brand reputation, compared to dyadic methods. In addition, it broadens the applications of <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> in marketing. Moreover this research shows how consumers and competitors may influence the brand image.
