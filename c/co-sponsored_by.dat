5|$|The {{success of}} the National Intercollegiate Band led to districts {{creating}} their own bands. One such group was the Atlantic Coast Intercollegiate Band, formed in 1958 at the convention of Districts X and XI. The Atlantic Coast band comprised around one hundred musicians and was conducted by Paul V. Yoder. The convention was hosted by the Beta Chi chapter at the University of Virginia, and the convention and concert were <b>co-sponsored</b> <b>by</b> the Universities of Rutgers, Maryland, and Pittsburgh. In 2009, the North Central District organized the first North Central District Intercollegiate Band. The North Central District Intercollegiate Band is the only currently functioning district intercollegiate band and has performed at every North Central District convention since its inaugural.|$|E
5|$|To {{defeat the}} Voting Rights Act, McCulloch {{introduced}} an alternative bill, H.R. 7896. It {{would have allowed}} the Attorney General to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination about a jurisdiction, {{and it would have}} imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth-grade education. McCulloch's bill was <b>co-sponsored</b> <b>by</b> House Minority Leader Gerald Ford (R-MI) and supported by Southern Democrats {{as an alternative to the}} Voting Rights Act. The Johnson administration viewed H.R. 7896 as a serious threat to passing the Voting Rights Act. However, support for H.R. 7896 dissipated after William M. Tuck (D-VA) publicly said he preferred H.R. 7896 because the Voting Rights Act would legitimately ensure that African Americans could vote. His statement alienated most supporters of H.R. 7896, and the bill failed on the House floor by a 171-248 vote on July 9. Later that night, the House passed the Voting Rights Act by a 333-85 vote (Democrats 221-61, Republicans 112-24).|$|E

50|$|A Bi-partisan Summit on Criminal Justice Reform, met in March 2015 {{to discuss}} {{reforming}} America's {{criminal justice system}} and received national news coverage. The Senate version (S.502) had gained 12 Bi-partisan <b>co-sponsors</b> <b>by</b> late May 2015; the house version (H.R.920) had 43 Bi-partisan <b>co-sponsors</b> <b>by</b> the same date. By the summer recess, H.R.920 had 52 co-sponsors and S. 502 had 12. Both version had been moved to committee for further discussion. The bill's Bi-Partisan support from both the Republican and Democratic parties helped increase its likelihood of moving through committee hearings. Additionally, organizations were behind the bill and actively encouraging its passage. The House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary was {{the next step in}} the bill being passed into law. The hearings and testimony that occurred in 2013 in relation to the 2013 version continued to be on record and in support of the 2015 version.|$|R

5|$|With 35 shotgun pellets {{still in}} his body, {{including}} three in the lining of his heart and five more embedded in his liver, LeMond attempted to return to racing in 1988. His comeback was hampered by over-training which resulted in tendonitis in his right shin requiring surgery. He missed the Tour {{for the second year}} running. Tensions in the relationship between LeMond and PDM were aggravated when LeMond discovered that doping was going on at the PDM squad. The result was that LeMond moved from PDM, one of the strongest teams in the peloton, to ADR, a team based in Belgium. The team was <b>co-sponsored</b> <b>by</b> Coors Light for American races. The deal was completed on New Year's Eve, just hours before LeMond would have been legally obligated to ride another season for the Dutch team. Joining the Belgian ADR squad allowed LeMond to continue to compete, but with teammates like Johan Museeuw who were better suited to riding Classics than Grand Tours.|$|E

The Alliance for the Wild Rockies based in Helena, Montana has been campaigning for the legislation for two decades with the help of numerous Congresspersons, celebrities, and grassroots groups such as the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Society.
