40|$|The MARC {{standard}} for representing <b>catalogue</b> <b>records</b> and the Z 39. 50 {{standard for}} locating and retrieving them have facilitated interoperability {{in the library}} domain {{for more than a}} decade. With the increasing ubiquity of XML, these standards are being superseded by MARCXML and MarcXchange for record representation and SRW/U for searching and retrieval. Service providers moving from the older standards to the newer generally need to support both old and new forms during the transition period. YAZ Proxy uses a novel approach to provide SRW/MARCXML access to the Library of Congress catalogue, by translating requests into Z 39. 50 and querying the older system directly.

Other parts of the collections have since been donated to or deposited in national or university libraries, including the National Library of Scotland. In 1946 the deposited collections were distributed to the British Museum, Cambridge University Library, and the John Rylands Library. Changes to these locations were made by later Earls of Crawford; apart from the Crawford family muniments those at the John Rylands Library were removed in 1988.|$|E
40|$|Objective – The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine if summary notes or table of contents notes in catalogue records are associated with the usage of e-books in a large university library. Methods – A retrospective cohort study, analyzing titles from three major collections of e-books was employed. Titles were categorized based on the inclusion of the MARC 505 note (table of contents) or MARC 520 note (summary) in the <b>catalogue</b> <b>record.</b> The usage was based on standardized reports from 2012 - 2013. The measures of usage were the number of titles used and the number of sections downloaded. Statistical methods used in the analysis included correlations and odd ratios (ORs). The usage measures were stratified by publication year and subject to adjust for the effects of these factors on usage. Results – The analysis indicates that these enhancements to the <b>catalogue</b> <b>record</b> increase usage significantly and notably. The probability of an e-book with one of the <b>catalogue</b> <b>record</b> enhancements being used (as indicated by the OR) was over 80...|$|E
