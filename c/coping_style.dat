25|$|In February 2013 a {{study found}} common genetic links between five major {{psychiatric}} disorders: autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Abnormal functioning of neurotransmitter systems has {{been implicated in}} several mental disorders, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine and glutamate systems. Differences have also {{been found in the}} size or activity of certain brain regions in some cases. Psychological mechanisms have also been implicated, such as cognitive (e.g. reasoning) biases, emotional influences, personality dynamics, temperament and <b>coping</b> <b>style.</b> Studies have indicated that variation in genes can {{play an important role in}} the development of mental disorders, although the reliable identification of connections between specific genes and specific categories of disorder has proven more difficult. Environmental events surrounding pregnancy and birth have also been implicated. Traumatic brain injury may increase the risk of developing certain mental disorders. There have been some tentative inconsistent links found to certain viral infections, to substance misuse, and to general physical health.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} by Geraerts, Merckelbach, Jelicic, & Smeets (2006) {{found that for}} individuals with low anxiety and high desirability traits (repressors), suppressed anxious autobiographical events initially intruded fewer times than in other groups (low, high, and high defensive anxious groups), but intruded more often after one week. This difference in <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> {{may account for the}} disparities within the literature. That said, the problem remains that the cause of the paradoxical effect may be in the thought tapping measures used (e.g. bell ringing). Evidence from Brown (1990) that showed participants were very sensitive to frequency information prompted Clarke, Ball and Pape (1991) to obtain participants' aposterio {{estimates of the number of}} intrusive target thoughts and found the same pattern of paradoxical results. However, even though such a method appears to overcome the problem, it and all the other methodologies use self-report as the primary form of data-collection. This may be problematic because of response distortion or inaccuracy in self-reporting.|$|E
40|$|Although recent {{research}} and theory indicates that {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) treatment might benefit from the utilisation of <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> facilitated by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), {{there has been little}} research exploring the relationships between these <b>coping</b> <b>styles,</b> posttraumatic cognitions, and PTSD symptomology. Furthermore, the ACT model (Hayes, Strosahl & Wilson, 1999) suggests that ACT-consistent <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> may be associated with increased positive outcome after trauma, such as posttraumatic growth (PTG). The present study aimed to explore individual differences in ACT <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> in individuals with a history of psychological trauma. A total of 112 participants completed online self-report measures of PTSD symptom severity, posttraumatic cognitions, ACT <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> and PTG. Regression analyses revealed that higher ACT <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> (specifically experiential acceptance) are associated with lower PTSD symptom severity and lower posttraumatic cognitions. Furthermore, the effect of ACT <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> on PTSD severity was partially mediated by posttraumatic cognitions, indicating that ACT <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> act on PTSD directly and indirectly. There was no evidence that higher ACT <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> were significantly associated with higher levels of posttraumatic growth (PTG). The findings suggest that effective treatment for trauma survivors could facilitate ACT-consistent <b>coping</b> <b>styles...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Knowledge of <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> {{is useful}} in {{clinical}} diagnosis and suggesting specific therapeutic interventions. However, the latent structures and relationships between different aspects of <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> have not been fully clarified. A full information item bifactor model will be beneficial to future research. OBJECTIVE: One goal {{of this study is}} identification of the best fit statistical model of <b>coping</b> <b>styles.</b> A second goal is entails extended analyses of latent relationships among different <b>coping</b> <b>styles.</b> In general, such research should offer greater understanding of the mechanisms of <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> and provide insights into coping with stress. METHODS: Coping Styles Questionnaire (CSQ) and Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) were administrated to officers suffering from military stress. Confirmatory Factor Analyses was performed to indentify the best fit model. A hierarchical item response model (bifactor model) was adopted to analyze the data. Additionally, correlations among <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> and self-efficacy were compared using both original and bifactor models. RESULTS: Results showed a bifactor model best fit the data. Item loadings on general and specific factors varied among different <b>coping</b> <b>styles.</b> All items loaded significantly on the general factor, and most items also had moderate to large loadings on specific factors. The correlation between <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> and self-efficacy and the correlation among different <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> changed significantly after extracting the general factor of coping stress using bifactor analysis. This was seen in changes from positive (r = 0. 714, p< 0. 01) correlation to negative (r =  - 0. 335, p< 0. 01) and also from negative (r =  - 0. 296, p< 0. 01) to positive (r = 0. 331, p< 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> have a bifactor structure. They also provide direct evidence of coexisting <b>coping</b> resources and <b>styles.</b> This further clarifies that dimensions of <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> should include <b>coping</b> resources and specific <b>coping</b> <b>styles.</b> This finding has implications for measurement of coping mechanisms, health maintenance, and stress reduction...|$|R

40|$|Individual {{differences}} in physiological and behavioural responses to stressors are increasingly recognised as adaptive variation and thus {{raw material for}} evolution and fish farming improvements including selective breeding. Such individual variation has been evolutionarily conserved and is present in all vertebrate taxa including fish. In farmed animals, the interest in consistent trait associations, that is <b>coping</b> <b>styles,</b> has increased dramatically {{over the last years}} because many studies have demonstrated links to performance traits, health and disease susceptibility and welfare. This study will review (i) the main behavioural, neuroendocrine, cognitive and emotional differences between reactive and proactive <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> in farmed fish; (ii) the methodological approaches used to identify <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> in farmed fish, including individual (group) mass-screening tests; and (iii) how knowledge on <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> may contribute to improved sustainability of the aquaculture industry, including welfare and performance of farmed fish.

Results: Bereaved survivors had lower scores for gregariousness, trust, and optimism, but higher scores for depressed mood, loneliness, becoming easily fearful, irritation, and anxiety than non-bereaved survivors. In addition, bereaved participants scored higher for avoiding problems, self-blame, and fantasy <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> than non-bereaved ones. Personality and <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> significantly correlated with psychosomatic status in bereaved and non-bereaved survivors.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Ciências Biológicas, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, 2016 Intensive {{aquaculture}} practices frequently expose fish to a {{range of}} stressors. Gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) is the most important farmed species in the Mediterranean, and like in other vertebrates, exhibit pronounced individual differences in stress responsiveness, however to which extent such variability is part of <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> remains unclear. As such, this Thesis aimed to provide methods and tools to analyse <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> in seabream, with specific reference to the presence, variability and consistency of individual trait correlations relevant to fish welfare. Using an evolutionary approach, it integrated and explored the adaptive links between behaviour, physiology and brain function, especially aiming to explore individual variation in adaptive responses of seabream when exposed to the same stressful situation. The background and consequences of <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> in aquaculture is introduced in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 aims to quantify individual differences in cortisol response in seabream and to assess whether it can predict aggressive behaviour. Results provided the first evidence for a link between HPI responsiveness and aggressive behaviour in seabream. This suggests that individual differences in aggression are part of <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> and therefore can be predictive of and predicted from other traits. In Chapter 4, it was investigated, {{for the first time in}} seabream, whether individual differences in behavioural responses to a variety of challenges are consistent over time and across contexts using both individual and grouped-based tests. Results suggest consistency over time and across-context in behavioural responses to challenges both using individual and grouped-based tests. This study highlights the possibility to predict behaviour in groups from individual coping traits. One of the traits that has been shown to be consistent over time and across context in the Chapter 4 was the escape response under a restraining test. Using this trait as a proxy of <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> in seabream the consistency of escape behaviour was investigated in Chapter 5 and 6. In Chapter 5 we investigated the effect of avoidance in gilthead seabream kept under different social contexts, i. e. the influence of other group members on individual avoidance behaviour consistency. The results demonstrate that grouping individuals with similar <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> induces changes in <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> whereas grouping individuals with different <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> favours <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> to remain the same. These findings suggest an influence of the social environment in seabream <b>coping</b> <b>styles.</b> In Chapter 6 we investigate the long term consistency of <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> both, over time and during different life history stages. Our results show consistent behaviour traits in seabream when juveniles, and a loss of these behavioural traits when adults. Therefore, these results underline that adding a life history approach to data interpretation is as an essential step forward towards understanding <b>coping</b> <b>styles.</b> Chapter 7 aimed to characterize the stress coping ability and brain function in seabream, by investigating the behavioural and forebrain physiological responses of fish displaying contrasting <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> to the same stimulus (escape response under a restraining test). Results show differences in activation of region-specific telencephalic regions between seabream displaying contrasting <b>coping</b> <b>styles.</b> It confirms the hypothesis that in seabream, inhibitory and excitatory markers of neural function appear to be associated with reactive and proactive <b>coping</b> <b>styles,</b> respectively. The main findings of this thesis are discussed and the main conclusions are presented in Chapter 8. It is concluded that fish with contrasting stress <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> show clear differences in behavioural and physiological parameters. Moreover, these differences can change according to social environment and life history. In general this Thesis has generated new knowledge of the mechanisms underlying individual responses of fish to stress providing new insights on the interrelations between different relevant husbandry practices, fish performance and welfare...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{summarise}} {{the evidence}} {{on the effect of}} psychological <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> (including fighting spirit, helplessness/hopelessness, denial, and avoidance) on survival and recurrence in patients with cancer. DESIGN: Systematic review of published and unpublished prospective observational studies. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Survival from or recurrence of cancer. RESULTS: 26 studies investigated the association between psychological <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> and survival from cancer, and 11 studies investigated recurrence. Most of the studies that investigated fighting spirit (10 studies) or helplessness/hopelessness (12 studies) found no significant associations with survival or recurrence. The evidence that other <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> play an important part was also weak. Positive findings tended to be confined to small or methodologically flawed studies; lack of adjustment for potential confounding variables was common. Positive conclusions seemed to be more commonly reported by smaller studies, indicating potential publication bias. CONCLUSION: There is little consistent evidence that psychological <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> play an important part in survival from or recurrence of cancer. People with cancer should not feel pressured into adopting particular <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> to improve survival or reduce the risk of recurrence. [References: 42...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to this, {{the way that}} an individual responds to stress can influence their health status.

For example, a laboratory study has shown that, while stress did not alter calorie intake or food type eaten when averaged across the sample as a whole, when looking at a subset of the sample who were classed as emotional eaters, high stress levels were associated with eating more high fat and sweet food and a more calorie dense meal overall.

50|$|Positive affect is theorized to {{influence}} physical health {{by means of}} the immune system. The immune system could be influenced positively by humor in a number of ways. The possibilities include simple immunoenhancement, stress moderation, or both. The pleasant experience of humor is thought to positively influence affect so that stress is moderated. The antibody secretory immunoglobin A (S-IgA) is associated with both positive and negative affect states, with negative states decreasing effectiveness and positive states increasing effects of the antibody. Levels of immune response can be predicted by the number of desirable events (and presumably mood) which occur in preceding days to the immune assessment. However, there is also evidence that significant mood changes in either direction can induce an increase in immune response. Laughter as an overt behavior is also associated with immune response, specifically NK cell activity, which are part of the body’s immune response. Glucocorticoids are lower in subjects who laughed while watching a humorous video, and glucocorticoids decrease NK cell activity, so humor theory posits this pathway as a possible mechanism for humor as a benefit to immune responses. However, it is unclear whether these effects on this specific immune response measurement have long-term effects with clinical significance. Using humor as a <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> is a way which these long-term effects on the immune system may be enacted. In one study, levels of S-IgA and the use of humor as a <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> were positively correlated, although the saliva sampling procedure of this study was subsequently called into question.|$|E
