5|$|T Aurigae (Nova Aurigae 1891) was a nova {{discovered}} at magnitude 5.0 on January 23, 1892, by Thomas David Anderson. It became {{visible to the}} naked eye by December 10, 1891, as shown on photographic plates examined after the nova's discovery. It then brightened by a factor of 2.5 from December 11 to December 20, when it reached a maximum magnitude of 4.4. T Aurigae faded slowly in January and February 1892, then faded quickly during March and April, reaching a magnitude of 15 in late April. However, its brightness began to increase in August, reaching magnitude 9.5, where it stayed until 1895. Over the subsequent two years, its brightness decreased to 11.5, and by 1903, it was approximately 14th magnitude. By 1925, it had reached its <b>current</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 15.5. When the nova was discovered, its spectrum showed material moving at a high speed towards Earth. However, when the spectrum was examined again in August 1892, it appeared to be a planetary nebula. Observations at the Lick Observatory by Edward Emerson Barnard showed it to be disc-shaped, with clear nebulosity in a diameter of 3 arcseconds. The shell had a diameter of 12 arcseconds in 1943. T Aurigae is classified as a slow nova, similar to DQ Herculis. Like DQ Herculis, WZ Sagittae, Nova Persei 1901 and Nova Aquilae 1918, it is a very close binary with a very short period. T Aurigae's period of 4.905 hours, comparable to DQ Herculis's period of 4.65 hours, and has a partial eclipse period of 40 minutes.|$|E

To test the proposed role of guard cell K+in channels in light-induced stomatal opening, transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated that expressed dominant negative point mutations in the K+in channel subunit KAT 1. Patch-clamp analyses with transgenic guard cells from independent lines showed that K+in <b>current</b> <b>magnitudes</b> were reduced by approximately 75 % compared with vector-transformed controls at − 180 mV, which resulted in reduction in light-induced stomatal opening by 38 % to 45 % compared with vector-transformed controls. Analyses of intracellular K+ content using both sodium hexanitrocobaltate (III) and elemental x-ray microanalyses showed that light-induced K+ uptake was also significantly reduced in guard cells of K+in channel depressor lines. These findings support the model that K+in channels contribute to K+ uptake during light-induced stomatal opening. Furthermore, transpirational water loss from leaves was reduced in the K+in channel depressor lines.

50|$|A high {{temperature}} Scanning SQUID Microscope using a YBCO SQUID {{is capable of}} measuring magnetic fields as small as 20 pT (about 2 million times weaker than the earth’s magnetic field). The SQUID sensor is sensitive enough that it can detect a wire {{even if it is}} carrying only 10 nA of current at a distance of 100 µm from the SQUID sensor with 1 second averaging. The microscope uses a patented design to allow the sample under investigation to be at room temperature and in air while the SQUID sensor is under vacuum and cooled to less than 80 K using a cryo cooler. No Liquid Nitrogen is used. During non-contact, non-destructive imaging of room temperature samples in air, the system achieves a raw, unprocessed spatial resolution equal to the distance separating the sensor from the current or the effective size of the sensor, whichever is larger. To best locate a wire short in a buried layer, however, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) back-evolution technique can be used to transform the magnetic field image into an equivalent map of the current in an integrated circuit or printed wiring board. The resulting current map can then be compared to a circuit diagram to determine the fault location. With this post-processing of a magnetic image and the low noise present in SQUID images, it is possible to enhance the spatial resolution by factors of 5 or more over the near-field limited magnetic image. The system’s output is displayed as a false-color image of magnetic field strength or <b>current</b> <b>magnitude</b> (after processing) versus position on the sample. After processing to obtain <b>current</b> <b>magnitude,</b> this microscope has been successful at locating shorts in conductors to within ±16 µm at a sensor-current distance of 150 µm.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main {{specifications}} that characterize a current mirror. The {{first is the}} transfer ratio (in {{the case of a}} current amplifier) or the output <b>current</b> <b>magnitude</b> (in the case of a constant current source CCS). The second is its AC output resistance, which determines how much the output current varies with the voltage applied to the mirror. The third specification is the minimum voltage drop across the output part of the mirror necessary to make it work properly. This minimum voltage is dictated by the need to keep the output transistor of the mirror in active mode. The range of voltages where the mirror works is called the compliance range and the voltage marking the boundary between good and bad behavior is called the compliance voltage. There are also a number of secondary performance issues with mirrors, for example, temperature stability.|$|E

5000|$|Reactor {{power winding}} current is {{regulated}} according to proportional control mode, when control angle of rectified current source thyristors is changed according to proportional mode depending on mismatching between the prescribed voltage setting and the voltage {{at the point}} of reactor connection. In case of necessity to implement the rapid transfer of the reactor from one quasi-steady-state mode to another one, the scheme of overexcitation/underexcitation is realized. In such case, time to gain full power starting from no-load condition is reduced up to 0,3 s. Constructively, it is possible to ensure every speed of the reactor power variation. However, based on practical experience of MCSR application, the optimal balance between the reactor operating speed and capacity of biasing system has been determined: speed of power increase/relief within 0,3 - 1,0 s, capacity of biasing system - 1 - 2% of the reactor rated capacity. [...] Depending upon desired requirements, MCSR is adjusted {{in such a way that}} would be possible to realize either voltage level stabilization, or consumed reactive power value, or consumed <b>current</b> <b>magnitude.</b> Controlled reactors, same as their non-controlled analogues, are subdivided into bus reactors and line reactors. Based on this principle, MCSR design would be completed with additional element which ensures pre-biasing of electromagnetic part and subsequent inertialess energizing of the reactor (with power increase time less than one cycle of power frequency). Similar to all transformer equipment, MCSR is able to withstand long-term overload up to 120 - 130% as well as should-term overload up to 200%. Moreover, considering the additional measures and the control algorithms, MCSR realizes all functions of uncontrolled shunt reactor including ability to operate within the interval of single-phase automatic reclosing.|$|E
40|$|In Kv 2. 1 {{potassium}} channels, {{changes in}} external [K+] modulate <b>current</b> <b>magnitude</b> {{as a result}} of a K+-dependent interconversion between two outer vestibule conformations. Previous evidence indicated that outer vestibule conformation (and thus <b>current</b> <b>magnitude)</b> is regulated by the occupancy of a selectivity filter binding site by K+. In this paper, we used the change in <b>current</b> <b>magnitude</b> as an assay to study how the interconversion between outer vestibule conformations is controlled. With 100 mM internal K+, rapid elevation of external [K+] from 0 to 10 mM while channels were activated produced no change in <b>current</b> <b>magnitude</b> (outer vestibule conformation did not change). When channels were subsequently closed and reopened in the presence of elevated [K+], <b>current</b> <b>magnitude</b> was increased (outer vestibule conformation had changed). When channels were activated in the presence of low internal [K+], or when K+ flow into conducting channels was transiently interrupted by an internal channel blocker, increasing external [K+] during activation did increase <b>current</b> <b>magnitude</b> (channel conformation did change). These data indicate that, when channels are in the activated state under physiological conditions, the outer vestibule conformation remains fixed despite changes in external [K+]. In contrast, when channel occupancy is lowered, (by channel closing, an internal blocker or low internal [K+]), the outer vestibule can interconvert between the two conformations. We discuss evidence that the ability of the outer vestibule conformation to change is regulated by the occupancy of a nonselectivity filter site by K+. Independent of the outer vestibule-based potentiation mechanism, Kv 2. 1 was remarkably insensitive to K+-dependent processes that influence <b>current</b> <b>magnitude</b> (<b>current</b> <b>magnitude</b> changed by < 7 % at membrane potentials between − 20 and 30 mV). Replacement of two outer vestibule lysines in Kv 2. 1 by smaller neutral amino acids made <b>current</b> <b>magnitude</b> dramatically more sensitive to the reduction in K+ driving force (<b>current</b> <b>magnitude</b> changed by as much as 40 %). When combined, these outer vestibule properties (fixed conformation during activation and the presence of lysines) all but prevent variation in Kv 2. 1 <b>current</b> <b>magnitude</b> when [K+] changes during activation.

Birkeland currents are required to transmit stress within the system. This thesis uses large-scale, statistical analysis (both temporal and spatial) to examine their magnitude and spatial extent {{in the context of}} the Dungey Cycle. Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) data are processed; the methodology is described and the success rate examined before the regions 1 and 2 Birkeland <b>current</b> <b>magnitudes</b> are explicitly compared to dayside and nightside reconnection rate for the first time. The <b>magnitudes</b> of the <b>currents</b> are well-correlated with both, suggesting that magnetic reconnection on day and nightside is driving higher Birkeland <b>current</b> <b>magnitudes.</b> The behaviour of the R 1 and R 2 currents is examined in a superposed epoch analysis of 2900 substorms identified by SuperMAG. Both current systems increase in magnitude and spatial extent during the growth phase of a substorm, peaking shortly after expansion phase onset. This analysis yields new information about how the currents react to the substorm cycle. A seasonal and a diurnal variation in the Birkeland <b>current</b> <b>magnitudes</b> is described and linked to the effect of ionospheric conductance; this is explored further, and it is found that currents are well-described by multiplying the dayside reconnection rate by an number representing the global variation of conductance with UT.
