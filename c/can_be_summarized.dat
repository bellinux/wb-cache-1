5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into the}} realm of quantum physics, but it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summarized</b> as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summarized</b> as follows: Seth {{has a clear}} and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E
5|$|Paraphrasing John Wheeler, Einstein's {{geometric}} {{theory of}} gravity <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summarized</b> thus: spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve. What {{this means is}} addressed in the following three sections, which explore the motion of so-called test particles, examine which properties of matter serve {{as a source for}} gravity, and, finally, introduce Einstein's equations, which relate these matter properties to the curvature of spacetime.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} special {{relativity}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summarized</b> by treating {{space and time}} as a unified structure known as spacetime (withc relating the units of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special symmetry called Lorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameterc. Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics, and general relativity. As such, the parameterc is ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts thatc is also the speed of gravity and of gravitational waves. In non-inertial frames of reference (gravitationally curved spacetime or accelerated reference frames), the local speed of light is constant and equal toc, but {{the speed of light}} along a trajectory of finite length can differ fromc, depending on how distances and times are defined.|$|E

Sadness is achieved by using dark and cold colors and by lines pointing downward.|$|E

25|$|Matsuhashi and Hallett's study <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summarized</b> thus. The {{researchers}} hypothesized that, if our conscious {{intentions are}} what causes movement genesis (i.e. {{the start of}} an action), then naturally, our conscious intentions should always occur before any movement has begun. Otherwise, if we ever become aware of a movement only after {{it has already been}} started, our awareness could not have been the cause of that particular movement. Simply put, conscious intention must precede action if it is its cause.|$|E

25|$|One {{might at}} first {{imagine that the}} economy of {{argument}} involved with the Kurgan solution should oblige us to accept it outright. But critics do exist and their objections <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summarized</b> quite simply– {{almost all of the}} arguments for invasion and cultural transformations are far better explained without reference to Kurgan expansions, and most of the evidence so far presented is either totally contradicted by other evidence or is the result of gross misinterpretation of the cultural history of Eastern, Central, and Northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{syllable}}s {{is defined by}} the number of vowels (i.e., every syllable must contain one and only one vowel) and the main rule <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summarized</b> as follows: a syllable can begin with at most one consonant (except for the first syllable of a word, which may contain up to three initial consonants). It means that a syllable can only begin without a consonant if there is no consonant after the preceding vowel (e.g. di-ó-nyi ‘nut-sized’), and if there are multiple consonants between vowels, only one can go to the next syllable (e.g. lajst-rom ‘list’).|$|E
25|$|The {{promotions}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summarized</b> as {{series of}} promotion chains, as follows. Within each block below, a piece (except the kings) promotes to the piece above it. Pieces {{at the top}} of each block do not promote (and if in italics, and with an *asterisk, as stated before, these appear only upon promotion). Note that pieces may only promote once. For example, a gold general promotes to a rook, and a rook promotes to a dragon king, but a gold general promoted to a rook cannot promote a second time to a dragon king. This is clear from the equipment, for each piece only has two sides.|$|E
