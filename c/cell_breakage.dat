40|$|Copyright © 2003 American Chemical SocietyAllium herbs, such as Chinese chive, garlic, and onion, share {{a common}} sulfur {{biochemistry}} that occurs on <b>cell</b> <b>breakage.</b> Sulfoxide precursors are converted enzymatically to sulfenic acid intermediates and thence {{to a variety of}} pungent and in some cases noxious sulfur species that probably act to deter herbivores. Very similar biochemistry has been proposed to occur in shiitake mushrooms. Prior to the present work, our understanding of the sulfur biochemistry of these plants and fungi has been derived largely from conventional analysis procedures. We have used in situ sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy in intact and disrupted allium plants and shiitake mushroom. The expected changes in sulfur forms following <b>cell</b> <b>breakage</b> are indeed observed for the alliums, but no significant changes occur for the fungus. Thus, any changes involving the sulfur-containing compounds of shiitake mushroom following <b>cell</b> <b>breakage</b> occur to a far smaller extent than those involving allium plants, presumably reflecting the need in shiitake for action by multiple enzymes, namely a gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and a C-S lyase. The shiitake C-S lyase occurs in far lower concentrations than the corresponding enzyme in garlic. Furthermore, cleavage of the flavorant precursor by the shiitake C-S lyase is reported to cease before cleavage of the precursor has been completed, presumably due to a product or suicide inhibition mechanism.

Sinusoidal accelerations at constant acceleration (120 m/s 2), in a range between 5 and 200 Hz were explored. The 50 Hz and 80 Hz frequencies were able to put in resonant condition the olive paste. In the vibrated samples at 50 Hz (15 min of treatment), the maximum increment of the extraction efficiency (about 53 % in comparison with the control), was observed.

40|$|Affinity {{isolation}} of proteins and associated complexes has facilitated {{the rapid growth}} of proteomic analyses (1). Model organisms amenable to targeted genetic engineering, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have {{been at the center of}} this development (2 – 7) —providing a simple, direct path for the capture of endogenous protein complexes, ideal for both proteomic and biochemical analyses (8). While gene targeting systems for mammalian cell-types have been around for decades (9 – 12), simple, efficient methods for expressing affinity-tagged fusion proteins at or near endogenous levels are a more recent development (13 – 18). Moreover, this devel-opment was necessary; it is widely acknowl-edged that protein over-expression can lead to experimental artifacts, including mislo-calization, and the formation of spurious interactions or altered activities (1, 19 – 21). Thus, for biomedical studies it is critical that tagged proteins be expressed at physi-ological levels. Simultaneously, the technologies and methods for <b>cell</b> <b>breakage</b> and affinity isolation have themselves evolved.

The temporal and spatial integrity of the genome ensures continued survival of a <b>cell.</b> DNA <b>breakage</b> {{is the first step}} towards creation of chromosomal translocations. In this review, we highlight the factors contributing towards the breakage of chromosomal DNA. It has been well-established that the structure and sequence of DNA {{play a critical role in}} selective fragility of the genome. Several non-B-DNA structures such as Z-DNA, cruciform DNA, G-quadruplexes, R loops and triplexes have been implicated in generation of genomic fragility leading to translocations. Similarly, specific sequences targeted by proteins such as Recombination Activating Genes and Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase are involved in translocations. Processes that ensure the integrity of the genome through repair may lead to persistence of breakage and eventually translocations if their actions are anomalous. An insufficient supply of nucleotides and chromatin architecture may also play a critical role.

Finally, a differential centrifugation method was devised to separate and enrich nuclei (2. 2 fold), mitochondria (4. 1 fold), endosomes/lysosomes (3. 7 fold) and cytosol (2. 5 fold). The intracellular trafficking of PK 1 was studied by differential centrifugation and time-dependent accumulation in lysosomes was confirmed, in contrast to free doxorubicin which accumulated in the nucleus.

Replication-stress-induced phosphorylation enables the rapid activation of numerous proteins involved in DNA replication, DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoints, including replication protein A (RPA). Here, we report that hydroxyurea (HU) -induced RPA phosphorylation requires both NBS 1 (NBN) and NBS 1 phosphorylation. Transfection of both phosphospecific and nonphosphospecific anti-NBS 1 antibodies blocked hyperphosphorylation of RPA in HeLa <b>cells.</b> Nijmegen <b>breakage</b> syndrome (NBS) <b>cells</b> stably transfected with an empty vector or with S 343 A-NBS 1 or S 278 A/S 343 A phospho-mutants were unable to hyperphosphorylate RPA in DNA-damage-associated foci following HU treatment.

Retention of ATR on chromatin in both NBS cells and in NBS cells expressing S 278 A/S 343 A NBS 1 mutants decreased after DNA damage, suggesting that ATR is the kinase responsible for RPA phosphorylation. The importance of RPA hyperphosphorylation is demonstrated by the ability of cells expressing a phospho-mutant form of RPA 32 (RPA 2) to suppress and delay HU-induced apoptosis.
