5|$|Modern weapons technologies, {{including}} the required research and development, are particularly <b>capital-intensive</b> and costly. The time between initial {{research and the}} deployment of weapon systems can be {{as long as a}} decade, during which the government must provide financial security and political justification for the project. In other words, the state not only provides the funding but also identifies a credible external enemy who warrants such expenditure.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 Robert Baldwin {{showed that}} U.S. imports were 27% more <b>capital-intensive</b> than U.S. exports in the 1962 trade data, using a measure similar to Leontief's.|$|E
25|$|As India's largest donor in {{the sector}} the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) {{finances}} {{a multitude of}} projects {{with a focus on}} <b>capital-intensive</b> urban water supply and sanitation projects, often involving follow-up projects in the same locations.|$|E
25|$|Exports of a capital-abundant country {{come from}} <b>capital-intensive</b> industries, and labour-abundant {{countries}} import such goods, exporting labour-intensive goods in return. Competitive pressures within the H–O model produce this prediction fairly straightforwardly. Conveniently, {{this is an}} easily testable hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{unemployment}} in Muslim countries {{seems to be}} high for women and economic opportunities are limited. Possible explanations for this phenomenon could the same determinants of high self-employment among females and low rates of female employers: low levels of economic development, gendered employment social norms, or <b>capital-intensive</b> industry. This last explanation may be particularly salient in the oil-rich Muslim nations because petroleum exports are <b>capital-intensive</b> and require very high skilled labor which most Muslim women are incapable of providing given low levels of education. The Great Recession has increased unemployment across the board in many Muslim nations and female workers were not left unaffected. According to the World Bank, in 2009, 22.9% of women were unemployed in Egypt.|$|E
25|$|This econometric {{find was}} the result of Wassily W. Leontief's attempt to test the Heckscher–Ohlin theory empirically. In 1953, Leontief found that the United States—the most capital-abundant country in the world—exported {{commodities}} that were more labor-intensive than <b>capital-intensive,</b> in contradiction with Heckscher–Ohlin theory ("H–O theory"). Leontief used this result to infer that the U.S. should adapt its competitive policy to match its economic realities.|$|E
25|$|Relative {{changes in}} output goods prices drive the {{relative}} {{prices of the}} factors used to produce them. If the world price of <b>capital-intensive</b> goods increases, it increases the relative rental rate and decreases the relative wage rate (the return on capital as against the return to labor). Also, {{if the price of}} labor-intensive goods increases, it increases the relative wage rate and decreases the relative rental rate.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{relocation}} has, to some extent, {{contributed to}} the upgrade of industries. The labour-intensive industries of Hong Kong were turned into <b>capital-intensive</b> and technology-intensive industries. The relocated Mainland factories became more effective than before their relocation thus increasing the productivity of the manufacturers. From 1985 to 2004, the total amount made by such manufacturers rose from HK$208,000 to HK$942,000. Products produced in the Mainland are also more competitive due to low costs.|$|E
25|$|The wide {{gap between}} male and female labor force {{participation}} rates and ratios, and the gap {{between male and}} female employers is indicative of gender inequality within the private sector of majority Muslim countries. However, numerous reasons may account for these outcomes such as weak education infrastructure for women, low levels of economic development, or simply <b>capital-intensive</b> resource development. The latter characteristic is probably given how many majority Muslim nations are net oil exporters.|$|E
25|$|Typically, elaborate, <b>capital-intensive</b> {{storm sewer}} {{networks}} are engineered {{to deal with}} stormwater. In some cities, such as the Victorian era London sewers or much of the old City of Toronto, the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant {{at the end of}} the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.|$|E
25|$|Wealthier {{households}} derive {{a larger}} share of their income from abroad. This might suggest that government policies in host countries favor <b>capital-intensive</b> activities. Even though work migration is mainly a low and middle class activity the high-income households are able to derive {{a larger share}} of their income from abroad due to favorable investment policies. These favorable investment policies causes an increase in income inequalities and do not promote domestic investments that can lead to increased standard of living.|$|E
25|$|In 1954 an econometric test by Wassily W. Leontief of the H–O model {{found that}} the United States, despite having a {{relative}} abundance of capital, tended to export labor-intensive goods and import <b>capital-intensive</b> goods. This problem {{became known as the}} Leontief paradox. Alternative trade models and various explanations for the paradox have emerged {{as a result of the}} paradox. One such trade model, the Linder hypothesis, suggests that goods are traded based on similar demand rather than differences in supply side factors (i.e., H–O's factor endowments).|$|E
25|$|Reswitching {{implies the}} {{possibility}} of capital reversing, an association between high interest rates (or rates of profit) and more <b>capital-intensive</b> techniques. Thus, reswitching implies the rejection of a simple (monotonic) non-increasing relationship between capital intensity and either the rate of profit, sometimes confusingly {{referred to as the}} rate of interest. As rates fall, for example, profit-seeking businesses can switch from using one set of techniques (A) to another (B) and then back to A. This problem arises for either a macroeconomic or a microeconomic production process and so goes beyond the aggregation problems discussed above.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, the {{labour-intensive}} {{industries of}} Hong Kong, which {{depended on the}} city's low costs to remain competitive, faced the problem of increasing land rents and labour costs. Moreover, the increase of population did not suffice as the demand for products grew. Compared to the other three Asian Tigers, Hong Kong's <b>capital-intensive</b> and technology-intensive industries were undeveloped and some less developed countries, such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, exceeded Hong Kong in the labour-intensive field. Another problem was the increasing protectionism of Western countries, causing some privileges to be removed and extra restrictions placed on Hong Kong products.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the brewing {{industry}} in northern Europe {{changed from a}} small-scale domestic industry to a large-scale export industry. The key innovation was the introduction of hops, which began in northern Germany in the 13th century. Hops sharply improved both the brewing process {{and the quality of}} beer. Other innovations from German lands involved larger kettle sizes and more frequent brewing. Consumption went up, while brewing became more concentrated because it was a <b>capital-intensive</b> industry. Thus in Hamburg per capita consumption increased from an average of 300 liters per year in the 15th century to about 700 in the 17th century.|$|E
25|$|With {{significant}} sprawl {{occurring in}} the following decades, public transport {{became more and more}} influenced by the decentralised, relatively low-density urban area, where private motor vehicle transport outpaced public transport. However, the growth of the city and of car use have led to serious traffic problems, which, together with the lack of good public transport, have been cited by many Aucklanders as one of the strongest negative factors in living there. Since car usage costs fall slightly with decreasing urban density while public transport costs rise sharply (even for less <b>capital-intensive</b> services like buses), Auckland's public transport will for the foreseeable future have to cope with a handicap compared to cities of similar population but higher density.|$|E
25|$|Canal {{projects}} {{and a new}} network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving relations over time. Ontario's numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied water power for development. Canals were <b>capital-intensive</b> infrastructure projects that facilitated trade. The Oswego Canal, built in New York 1825–1829, was a vital commercial link in the Great Lakes–Atlantic seaway. It was connected to Ontario's Welland Canal in 1829. The newly fashioned Oswego–Welland line offered an alternate route to the St. Lawrence River and Europe, {{as opposed to the}} Erie Canal, which connected the Great Lakes to New York City via the Mohawk and Hudson rivers.|$|E
25|$|The main {{elements}} of the economic strategy proposed by the García government were full of promise. They recognized the prior neglect of the agricultural sector and called for redirecting public programs toward promotion of agricultural growth and reduction of rural poverty. Correspondingly, economic activity was to be decentralized to break down its high concentration in Lima, and within the cities resources were to be redirected away from the <b>capital-intensive</b> and import-intensive modern sector to the labor-intensive informal sector. A strategy of concertación (national understanding) with private business leaders on economic issues was to be used systematically to avoid disruptive conflict. Problems of external balance were to be answered both by restructuring production to lessen dependence on imports and by reorienting toward higher exports over the long-term.|$|E
25|$|ISI {{was most}} {{successful}} {{in countries with}} large populations and income levels which allowed for the consumption of locally produced products. Latin American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and (to a lesser extent) Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela, had the most success with ISI. This is so because while the investment to produce cheap consumer products may pay off in a small consumer market, the same cannot be said for <b>capital-intensive</b> industries, such as automobiles and heavy machinery, which depend on larger consumer markets to survive. Thus, smaller and poorer countries, such as Ecuador, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic, could implement ISI only to a limited extent. Peru implemented ISI in 1961, and the policy lasted {{through to the end}} of the decade in some form.|$|E
25|$|The US {{government}} in Puerto Rico enticed US companies by providing labor at costs below {{those on the}} mainland, access to contiguous US markets without import duties, and profits that could transfer to the mainland free from federal taxation. The Administration of Economic Development invited investment of external capital, importing the raw materials, and exporting the finished products to the mainland. To entice participation, tax exemptions and differential rental rates were offered for industrial facilities. As a result, Puerto Rico's economy shifted labor from agriculture to manufacturing and tourism. The manufacturing sector has shifted from the original labor-intensive industries, such as the manufacturing of food, tobacco, leather, and apparel products, to more <b>capital-intensive</b> industries, such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machinery, and electronics. Through this project, a rural agricultural society was transformed into an industrial working class.|$|E
25|$|The cost of food {{irradiation}} {{is influenced by}} dose requirements, the food's tolerance of radiation, handling conditions, i.e., packaging and stacking requirements, construction costs, financing arrangements, and other variables particular to the situation. Irradiation is a <b>capital-intensive</b> technology requiring a substantial initial investment, ranging from $1million to $5million. In the case of large research or contract irradiation facilities, major capital costs include a radiation source, hardware (irradiator, totes and conveyors, control systems, and other auxiliary equipment), land (1 to 1.5acres), radiation shield, and warehouse. Operating costs include salaries (for fixed and variable labor), utilities, maintenance, taxes/insurance, cobalt-60 replenishment, general utilities, and miscellaneous operating costs. Perishable food items, like fruits, vegetables and meats would still require to be handled in the cold chain, so all other supply chain costs remain the same.|$|E
25|$|The Industrial Development Act 1966 {{changed the}} name of Development Districts (parts of the country {{with higher levels of}} {{unemployment}} than the national average and which governments sought to encourage greater investment in) to Development Areas and increased the percentage of the workforce covered by development schemes from 15% to 20%, which mainly affected rural areas in Scotland and Wales. Tax allowances were replaced by grants in order to extend coverage to include firms which were not making a profit, and in 1967 a Regional Employment Premium was introduced. Whereas the existing schemes tended to favour <b>capital-intensive</b> projects, this aimed {{for the first time at}} increasing employment in depressed areas. Set at £1.50 a man per week and guaranteed for seven years, the Regional Employment Premium subsidised all manufacturing industry (though not services) in Development Areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{finance and}} real estate {{industries}} bloomed in the 1990s. However, the dependence on such industries caused a loss of competitiveness between products produced by Hong Kong-based manufacturers and those from the international market. The other Asian Tigers had developed <b>capital-intensive</b> industries such as crude oil, computers and heavy industries. As a result, the government of Hong Kong has tried to develop knowledge-based, high-technology and higher-value-added industries. High-technology training programmes have been provided as well as courses related to information technology and biotechnology. Land was used for high-technology industries, notably Cyberport. Research centres {{have been set up}} to support such industries, notably the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park. High-technology exports took up one-third of Hong Kong's total exports in 2005. Manufacturing workers who are unskilled in other areas are unemployed as a result of industrial relocation. To aid them, the government provided retraining programmes, allowing them, especially those in the tertiary industry, to get new jobs.|$|E
25|$|The United States' {{entry into}} World War II impeded Baldwin's Diesel {{development}} program when the War Production Board dictated that Alco and Baldwin produce only steamers and Diesel-electric yard switching engines. Electro-Motive Division (EMD) was assigned {{the task of}} producing road freight Diesels (namely, the FT series). EMD's distinct advantage over its competitors in that product line {{in the years that}} followed World War II, due to the head start in diesel R and production, is beyond doubt, however, assigning it solely to WPB directives is questionable. Longtime GM chairman Alfred P. Sloan presented a timeline in his memoir that belies this assumption, saying that GM's diesel-engine R efforts of the 1920s and 1930s, and its application of model design standardization (yielding lower unit costs) and marketing lessons learned in the automotive industry, were the principal reason for EMD's competitive advantage in the late 1940s and afterward (clearly implying that the wartime production assignments were merely nails in a coffin that Baldwin and Lima had already built for themselves before the war). In his telling, the R needed to adapt earlier Diesels (best suited to marine and stationary use) to locomotive use (smaller; higher power-to-weight ratio; more reliable given more vibration and less maintenance) was a <b>capital-intensive</b> project that almost no one among the railroad owners or locomotive builders was willing (latter) or able (former) to invest in during the 1920s and 1930s, save the people of Winton, Electro-Motive, and Charles F. Kettering of the GM Research Corporation.|$|E
500|$|If the two {{production}} goods depicted are {{capital investment}} (to increase future production possibilities) and current consumption goods, the higher is investment this year, {{the more the}} PPF would shift out in following years. Shifts of the curve can represent how technological progress that favors production possibilities of one good, say guns, {{more than the other}} shifts the PPF outwards more along the favored good's axis, [...] "biasing" [...] production possibilities in that direction. Similarly, if one good makes more use of say capital and if capital grows faster than other factors, growth possibilities might be biased in favor of the <b>capital-intensive</b> good.|$|E
500|$|Innis {{argues that}} [...] "the {{history of the}} Canadian Pacific Railroad is {{primarily}} {{the history of the}} spread of Western civilization over the northern half of the North American continent". As Robert Babe notes, the railway brought industrialization, transporting coal and building supplies to manufacturing sites. It was also a kind of communications medium that contributed to the spread of European civilization. Babe writes that, for Innis, the CPR's equipment [...] "comprised a massive, energy-consuming, fast-moving, powerful, <b>capital-intensive</b> 'sign' dropped into the very midst of indigenous peoples, whose entire way of life was disrupted, and eventually shattered as a result.|$|E
2500|$|With {{this single}} difference, Ohlin {{was able to}} discuss the new {{mechanism}} of comparative advantage, using just two goods and two technologies to produce them. One technology would be a <b>capital-intensive</b> industry, the other a labor-intensive business—see [...] "assumptions" [...] below.|$|E
2500|$|The Seminole in Florida {{have been}} engaged in stock raising since the mid-1930s, when they {{received}} cattle from western Native Americans. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) hoped that the cattle raising would teach Seminoles to become citizens by adapting to agricultural settlements. The BIA also hoped that this program would lead to Seminole self-sufficiency. Cattle owners realized that by using their cattle as equity, they could engage in [...] "new <b>capital-intensive</b> pursuits", such as housing.|$|E
2500|$|Rail {{transport}} is an energy-efficient but <b>capital-intensive</b> {{means of}} mechanized land transport. The tracks provide smooth and hard surfaces {{on which the}} wheels of the train can roll with a relatively low level of friction being generated. Moving a vehicle on and/or through a medium (land, sea, or air) requires that it overcomes resistance to its motion caused by friction. A land vehicle's total resistance (in pounds or Newtons) is a quadratic function of the vehicle's speed: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the modern}} world, money {{is much more}} mobile than labor, so import of capital to a country almost {{certainly}} shifts the relative factor-abundances in favor of capital. The magnification effect says that a 10% increase in national capital {{may lead to a}} redistribution of labor amounting to a fifth of the entire economy (towards <b>capital-intensive,</b> high-tech production). Notably, employment patterns in very poor countries can be dramatically affected by a small amount of FDI, in this model. (See also: Dutch disease.) ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{calculated}} {{that the number of}} engineering firms in Manchester more than halved between 1899 and 1939, with the inter-war recession causing particularly severe contraction in the manufacturing spheres of textile machinery, locomotive engineering and boilermaking. The businesses most likely to survive were those that did not rely extensively on exports, on the production of capital goods and on time-served skilled labour– [...] "the newer, more <b>capital-intensive,</b> mass-production, domestic market-oriented engineering firms, employing a large proportion of semi-skilled labour fared better and dominated the industry by 1939." ...|$|E
2500|$|This period {{included}} a twenty-year depression in agriculture {{that started with}} the end of the Napoleonic Wars and lasted until 1836. [...] This depression was so severe that landlords as well as tenants suffered financial ruin, and large areas of farmland were entirely abandoned. [...] This showed the problems of the ancient landlord and tenant system in running new-style, <b>capital-intensive</b> farms, and it caused concern in Parliament. [...] The system began to improve, for example by distinguishing between farm improvements that the tenant should fund, and those the landlord should fund.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Capital-intensive</b> {{agribusiness}} {{had transformed}} the scene; deep wells into the aquifer, intensive irrigation, {{the use of}} artificial pesticides and fertilizers, and giant harvesters were creating immense crops year after year whether it rained or not. [...] According to the farmers he interviewed, technology had provided the perfect answer to old troubles, such of the bad days would not return. [...] In Worster's view, by contrast, the scene demonstrated that America's capitalist high-tech farmers had learned nothing. [...] They [...] were continuing {{to work in an}} unsustainable way, devoting far cheaper subsidized energy to growing food than the energy could give back to its ultimate consumers.|$|E
2500|$|For many economists, Leontief's paradox {{undermined}} {{the validity of}} the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem (H–O) theory, which predicted that trade patterns would be based on countries' comparative advantage in certain factors of production (such as capital and labor). Many economists have dismissed the H-O theory in favor of a more Ricardian model where technological differences determine comparative advantage. These economists argue that the United States has an advantage in highly skilled labor more so than capital. This can be seen as viewing [...] "capital" [...] more broadly, to include human capital. Using this definition, the exports of the United States are very (human) <b>capital-intensive,</b> and not particularly intensive in (unskilled) labor.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, the Chinese {{government}} {{launched its}} Western Development Strategy aimed at boosting {{the economies of}} its poorer western regions. The strategy has featured a strong bias for large-scale, <b>capital-intensive</b> projects such as the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. Such projects however, have roused fears of facilitating military mobilisation and Han migration. [...] Robert Barnett reports that the economic stimulus was used by hardliners to stimulate Han migration to Tibet as a control mechanism, and that 66% of official posts in Tibet are held by Han. [...] There is still an ethnic imbalance in appointments and promotions to the civil and judicial services in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, with disproportionately few ethnic Tibetans appointed to these posts.|$|E
2500|$|Ottoman Palestine was a harsh environment. [...] The Galilee was swampy, the Judaean Mountains rocky, and {{the south}} of the country, the Negev, was a desert. To make things more challenging, most of the {{settlers}} had no prior farming experience. The sanitary conditions were also poor. Malaria, typhus and cholera were rampant. Bedouins would raid farms and settled areas. Sabotage of irrigation canals and burning of crops were also common. Living collectively was simply the most logical way to be secure in an unwelcoming land. On top of safety considerations, establishing a farm was a <b>capital-intensive</b> project; collectively, the founders of the kibbutzim had the resources to establish something lasting, while independently they did not.|$|E
