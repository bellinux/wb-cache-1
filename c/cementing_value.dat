Through these techniques used pore types, porosity and <b>cement</b> <b>values</b> were identified, to determine whether these alternative methods of petrographic image analysis and Computed Tomography (CT) technology could be viable techniques to replace older image analysis methodologies that take more time, money and are far more destructive. To accomplish this, a workflow was developed to analyze petrographic images and CT scan data. These values were then evaluated for accuracy {{by comparing the results}} to a previous study which used helium injection testing, a method considered to have a high level of accuracy. The Happy Spraberry Field is located in the South Central part of Garza County, Texas. It forms part of the Eastern Shelf, which produces from a 100 foot thick carbonate interval and is the second largest oil field that produces from the Lower Clear Fork Formation in the Midland Basin. The formation consists of six facies that have been identified in previous studies. These facies are oolitic skeletal grainstones and packstones, floatstones and rudstones, In situ Tubiphytes bindstones, and siltstones from slope deposits. There was a slightly lower trend in the porosity values from this study and the benchmark data from the helium test analysis. This discrepancy was attributed to the low resolution, and incomplete magnification of the microporosity from the computer and images. The results were within a reasonable range of the true porosity values, but can be improved by reworking the workflow used. The <b>cement</b> <b>values</b> obtained through this workflow helped demonstrate the idea that high cementation levels directly correlate to low porosity values. These results are considered to be accurate due to the specific way in which the workflow was modified to only color-change the pixels inside the cemented areas. Finally, it was concluded that rock characteristics, such as pore types, could be observed through image analysis techniques as long as the thin section images have a good resolution that allows for minimal distortion of the image...|$|R

With consumers worn out by the excessive amount of products on the market, and hungry for experiences that bring meaning to their daily lifes, design is now, more than ever, a crucial process in the search for innovation. Design has earned its place in society and is today seen as an indispensable tool for economies that want to be competitive, innovative and differentiating. The intense studies in design methodologies have raised the profession’s recognition and allow it to gain important methods for a conscious and professional practice. Design is the discipline which enables a product to stand out for its relevance and opportunity, as well as for its appearance and functionality. Through Design Thinking, Design should be present in the innovation process from the outset, applying its abductive character, collaborative sense, human-centered approach, and especially, enforcing ethical, social and environmental issues inherent in its practice. In order to achieve real innovation through Design, this paper proposes a new work methodology, the Briefing Innovation, which intends to give the designer a major role in deciding "what to do.

40|$|Upper Jurassic Fulmar Formation shelf {{sandstones}} of the high- temperature, high-pressure Franklin and Elgin Fields (South Central Graben, North Sea) contain abundant disseminated and concretionary ankerite. In contrast, most Jurassic North Sea reservoirs contain {{only minor}} amounts of dispersed ankerite. Disseminated ankerite cement in the Franklin and Elgin Fields has a fairly uniform isotopic composition (delta(18) O approximate to - 10 to - 12. 5 parts per thousand PDB, delta(13) C approximate to - 3 to - 5 parts per thousand PDB). Ankerite concretions have delta(18) O values similar to disseminated cements but {{a wider range}} of delta(13) C values (+ 1 to - 5. 5 parts per thousand PDB). They also have highly variable intergranular volumes, which (together with the delta(13) C data) are interpreted as a combination of pore-filling cementation and in situ replacement of comminuted bioclastic debris by ankerite. Fluid-inclusion, delta(18) O, and paragenetic evidence suggests that ankerite formed during deep burial (c, 3. 5 to 4. 5 km, 140 - 170 degrees C), after the onset of overpressuring, but before hydrocarbon emplacement in the reservoirs. The regionally consistent delta(18) O data suggest that ankerite formed via a temperature-influenced mechanism, and the relatively uniform delta(13) C <b>cement</b> <b>value</b> indicates that organic matter and marine bioclastic carbonate contributed to the dissolved carbon reservoir in constant proportion, This can be explained by calcite dissolution in response to pH decrease during thermal breakdown of organic acids. Such acids were derived from adjacent mudrocks undergoing hydrocarbon maturation and clay-mineral transformations, and are likely to have been transported in pore fluids with Mg 2 + and Fe 2 +. The presence of these cations in solution upon thermal decarboxylation is inferred to have stabilized ankerite at the expense of calcite. A relative paucity of ankerite in other Fulmar Formation reservoirs may reflect different sedimentological compositions (less bioclastic debris) and/or lower burial temperatures (less advanced decarboxylation) ...|$|R

Also, to {{evaluate and}} compare combinations of three different shades and thicknesses of porcelain veneers and three cement shades before and after final cementation. Additionally, to evaluate and compare the color of porcelain veneers with cured permanent cement before and after aging. Background: Porcelain veneers and ceramic restorations have {{become one of the}} most popular approaches in the anterior area due to their natural appearance and esthetics. However, more conservative approaches have led to thinner restorations with increased translucency. A potential drawback to these restorations is that any color change in the luting cement can become clinically visible, and possibly affect esthetic appearance. Methods: One hundred and eight specimens were cut from feldspathic porcelain blocs (Vitablocs Mark II for CEREC). Three different Vita 3 D- Master 1 M 1, 2 M 2, and 3 M 1 shades were assessed. All specimens were 12 x 14 mm, with three different thicknesses of 0. 3, 0. 5, and 1. 0 mm. Light-cured resin cement (Variolink Veneer, Ivoclar Vivadent) with three different shades was used. The specimen color alone, with the try-in paste, and with pre-cured and post-cured resin cement was measured using a spectrophotometer (Color Eye 7000 A), which measures CIE-L*a*b* values. Specimens were subjected to 30, 000 cycles of accelerated aging (Themo-cycling, Sarbi Dental Enterprises Inc.). Color measurement for all specimens was performed again and ∆E values between groups been calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way and three-way ANOVA, with level of significant set at α= 0. 05, to assess differences between groups. This was followed by post hoc Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s tests. Results: Statistical analysis showed a significant difference between try-in paste and corresponding cured resin cement.

40|$|Effect of {{light-curing}} {{method and}} indirect veneering materials on the Knoop hardness of a resin cement Abstract: This study evaluated the Knoop hardness of a dual-cured res-in cement (Rely-X ARC) activated solely by chemical reaction (control group) or by chemical / physical mode, light-cured through a 1. 5 mm thick ceramic (HeraCeram) or composite (Artglass) disc. Light cur-ing {{was carried out}} using conventional halogen light (XL 2500) for 40 s (QTH); light emitting diodes (Ultrablue Is) for 40 s (LED); and Xenon plasma arc (Apollo 95 E) for 3 s (PAC). Bovine incisors had their buc-cal face flattened and hybridized. On this surface a rubber mold (5 mm in diameter and 1 mm in height) was bulk filled with the resin cement. A polyester strip was seated for direct light curing or through the discs of veneering materials. After dry storage in the dark (24 h/ 37 °C), the samples (n = 5) were sectioned for hardness (KHN) measurements, taken in a microhardness tester (50 gF load/ 15 s). The data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey’s test (α = 0. 05). The cement presented higher Knoop hardness values with Artglass for QTH and LED, com-pared to HeraCeram. The control group and the PAC/Artglass group showed lower hardness values compared to the groups light-cured with QTH and LED. PAC/HeraCeram resulted in the worst combination for <b>cement</b> hardness <b>values...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present research was to evaluate the effect of fibre morphology (e. g., length, width, fibrillation, broken ends, content of fines and number of fibres per gram) on flocculation and drainage properties of fibre-cement suspensions and on physical properties of the fibre-cement composites. Mechanical refining was used to change the morphological properties of Eucalyptus and Pinus pulps. Results show that the mechanical refining increased {{the size of the}} formed flocs and decreased the concentration of free small particles (with dimensions between 1 and 20 pm) {{as a consequence of the}} increased fibrillation and content of fines, which increased the capacity of the fibres to capture the mineral particles. High levels of refining were necessary for Pinus pulp to obtain <b>cement</b> retention <b>values</b> similar to those obtained by unrefined Eucalyptus pulp. This is due to the higher number of fibres per gram in Eucalyptus pulp than in Pinus pulp. Pulp refining improved the packing of the particles and, although decreased the drainage rate. it contributed to a less porous structure, which improved the microstructure of the composite.

40|$|Abstract. The mass {{content of}} {{aggregate}} (ma) and of cement (mc) of concrete comprise coefficient calculated as ma/mc. Some methods used for designing of concrete mixtures {{take into consideration}} this coefficient. In this paper, concrete mixtures were prepared so that mass of cement, water cement factor and granulometric composition have been varied. Values of the coefficient ma/mc in experimental research ranged between 7, 20 in concrete mixtures mixed with 250 kg of cement to 3, 60 in concrete mixtures mixed with 500 kg per 1 m 3. From the aspect of compressive strength of concrete, it has been established that optimum values of the coefficient ma/mc depend on the granulometric composition and water cement factor. At higher water <b>cement</b> factors, larger <b>values</b> of ma/mc coefficient are required to achieve the maximum strength under the given conditions. Key words: aggregate mass, cement mass, concrete compressive strength. 1...|$|R
40|$|An {{anomalous}} Upper Jurassic limestone bed, 3 m thick, {{is present}} within the volcaniclastic infill of a forearc basin, exposed on Alexander Island, Antarctica. The limestone, formally designated the Gateway Pass Limestone Bed, contains laminated crusts and blocks, including hardgrounds, showing radial-fibrous and botryoidal calcite <b>cements.</b> Carbon isotope <b>values</b> are very negative (delta 13 C of - 33. 5 per thousand to - 44. 6 per thousand PDB) indicating a methane-oxidation origin for the carbonate. The limestone bed formed around a submarine cold seep in the Antarctic Peninsula forearc basin {{adjacent to the}} accretionary prism. In contrast to adjacent nearly barren sea floor the limestone also yields a "benthic island" assemblage containing abundant gastropods and bivalves. The seep is directly comparable to certain Jurassic seeps at the convergent margin of the northeast Pacific, and both are related to subduction at the eastern proto-Pacific margin...|$|R
40|$|Enhancing {{the cement}} {{strength}} through attaching chemical additive has been popular {{to meet the}} required condition for a particular well-cementing job. However, due to a low oil-price phenomenon, pouring and additive should be reconsidered because it can raise the cost and make the project become uneconomic. Another additive material in nanocomposite form will be introduced through this experimental study. The nanocomposite material consist of silica nanoparticle, known as “Nanosilica” and a palm-shell-waste, which is abundant in Indonesia. Before making a nanocomposite, the palm-shell should be burned to obtain a charcoal form, ground and sieved to attain a uniform size.    The study focuses on the two parameters, compressive strength and shear bond strength, which can reflect {{the strength of the}} <b>cement.</b> These <b>values</b> are obtained by performing a biaxial loading test to the cement sample. Various samples with different concentration of nanocomposite should be prepared and following the mixing, drying, and hardening process before the loading test is carried out. The result from the test shows a positive indication for compressive strength and shear bond strength values, according to the representative well cementing standards. Increasing the nanocomposite concentration on the cement will increase these values. Furthermore, an investigation on the temperature effect confirms that the sample with 700 oC burning temperature have highest compressive-strength and shear-bond-strength values. This is a potential opportunity utilizing a waste-based material to produce another product with higher economic value...|$|R
40|$|Series of {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} analysing the effect of fluid loss rate of cement slurry due {{to the existence of}} permeability contributing to the corrosion rate of cement slurry. Both class G and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with different fluid loss were used to compare the cement protective effect on corrosion. The fluid loss was measured according to the API spec 10. 3. 5 % Natrium Chloride (NaCI) solution was used as the corrosion environment for reservoir and atmospheric conditions. A laboratory experiment is was done to study the influence of permeability for both types of <b>cement.</b> Permeability <b>value</b> was changed by alternating water cement ratio. Steel was put into cement mixture and left submerged in a brine solution. Submersion was done in atmospheric condition with a fixed temperature of 32 oC and 52 oC for reservoir condition. For both experiments, the A. C. Impendence technique was used. Results were discussed in depth to state that cement slurry with higher fluid loss will give a lower corrosion resistance, Rp and thus increasing the corrosion rate. Corrosion rate is higher at reservoir condition and both class G and OPC show the same characteristics and behaviour. However, class G cement shows better corrosion effective characteristic. Results from the permeability experiment shows that the permeability of OPC system is higher that the class G cement as well as the permeability being higher in reservoir condition rather than atmospheric condition...|$|R
