This technique allows for reduced medication doses that can decrease the side effects typically associated with oral or parenteral drug delivery. Recent expert panel consensus guidelines have provided <b>care</b> <b>paths</b> in the treatment of nociceptive, neuropathic, and mixed pain syndromes. While the data for pain relief, adverse effect reduction, and cost-effectiveness with cancer pain control are compelling, the evidence is less clear for noncancer pain, other than spasticity. Physicians should be aware of mechanical, pharmacological, surgical, and patient-specific complications, including possible granuloma formation. Newer intrathecal drug delivery systems may allow for better safety and quality of life outcomes. Keywords: pain control, intrathecal analgesia, drug delivery system...|$|E
40|$|Child {{and family}} welfare policy makers of Veneto Region (Italy) asked the University of Padua to {{research}} the <b>care</b> <b>paths</b> {{of a group of}} former fostered children in order to inquire how this experience of Foster Care impacted their present life, and to increase the effectiveness of the work with children out-of-home and their families. The specific goal of the research was to analyse the trajectories of life and the personal representation of young adults collecting the feelings and thoughts about their personal story; the experience of life in foster care; the end of the care process; the present life – wellbeing level. Using a quanti-qualitative approach, data about 50 people at least 20 y. o. who lived in foster care from 1998 to 2008 for at least 6 months, were collected via semi-structured face-to-face interviews and a questionnaire. The first results show interviewees have a mostly positive representation of their selves, of the relationship with their foster family and of the relationships within their social network; most of them have a job, even if not always with stable position, and are not in care anymore; often they are really critical about their care process and the child welfare, and complain about the lack of a unique and shared project...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although it is {{advocated}} that (major) {{surgical procedures}} should be embedded in clinical pathways, {{the efficacy of}} such pathways is hardly ever systematically evaluated. The objective of our study {{was to assess the}} results of a multidisciplinary <b>care</b> <b>path</b> for patients undergoing thoracic cancer surgery, using a concurrent integrated prospective database. Methods: From April 2006 to December 2008, 169 eligible patients, admitted for thoracic cancer surgery in our institute, gave informed consent to participate in this prospective study. Detailed clinical data concerning patient-, tumour-, treatment- and outcome characteristics were collected. For evaluation of pain and quality of life (QoL), visual analogue scale (VAS) and SF- 36 were used respectively. Information retrieved on 94 patients operated in the baseline period (until November 2007) was used in multidisciplinary consensus meetings to develop a new <b>care</b> <b>path.</b> After the introduction of this <b>care</b> <b>path</b> (January 2008) data-collection continued to evaluate outcome using the data of 75 patients operated in the evaluation period (until December 2008). Results: Data from the baseline period showed age (p = 0. 001), indication (p = 0. 03), postoperative pain (p < 0. 001) and complications (p < 0. 001) to be independently related to length of stay (LOS). Subsequently, the package of measures taken in the multidisciplinary <b>care</b> <b>path</b> were evaluated, showing significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0. 026) and a reduced length of hospital stay (p = 0. 014). In addition, a (trend towards) improvement in physical quality of life was observed 1 month (p = 0. 03) and 6 months (p = 0. 07) postoperatively. Conclusion: The use of a prospective database integrated in a clinical <b>care</b> <b>path</b> for thoracic cancer patients revealed important improvements of the care process determining short- and long-term outcome. There was a significant reduction in length of hospital stay, postoperative pain and loss of quality of life. Ongoing and multicentre collection of such data can provide surgeons with instruments to further improve quality of care. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R

The authors describe the quality process of a PARU in a University Hospital (UH); this quality process {{had previously been}} used in a private rehabilitation hospital. GoalsThe authors wanted to evaluate {{the organization of the}} care provided in their PARU and compare the evaluation results with the results expected at the unit's creation five years earlier. MethodsThe evaluation indicators were set when the unit was created. These indicators allowed the evaluation of the appropriateness of admissions, the efficiency of the <b>care</b> <b>path</b> and the response to the patients’ rehabilitation and intensive care needs. ResultsThe appropriateness of admission was found to be coherent with the typology of patients admitted (i. e., brain and spinal cord injured patients just discharged from intensive care units). The brain-injured <b>care</b> <b>path</b> was streamlined. The evaluation results raised several questions about the resources provided and about the different needs of post-acute care and rehabilitation.

The indicators used must be capable of assessing both the quantity and the quality of care. If these indicators lack relevance, or if the health care organization responds incompletely to patient needs, it puts the efficiency of the whole system at stake...|$|R

When her labour started, the CETI {{paid for her}} taxi transfer to the hospital. There, she gave birth naturally, stayed for less than 24  h as most CETI women, and received good, as she said, care. When we visited her in the Centre afterward, her newborn was tightly wrapped into a cotton piece of cloth, and slept on the bed. The Centre had no cradles; babies slept in bed with their mothers, who remained half-asleep throughout the night from fear of harming the baby during their sleep. In the room, several women {{sat on the floor}} around Fadwa; they were chatting, and a couple of children played by going up and down the bunk beds. One of the women prepared some tea, using a kettle that she carefully dried, and put back in its packaging, after she had poured tea in plastic cups. CETI residents were not allowed to boil water or even bring food in the rooms; hygiene and safety first, claimed the social workers. Fadwa’s newborn was not the only baby in the room; another woman held a 3 -month-old baby born in Morocco before she had arrived in Melilla. Impatient to leave the Centre and to continue her journey, Fadwa did not wish to receive more medical care.|$|E

In this report, we describe the proceedings of a workshop to formulate and prioritize research questions about infections in older adults using an interdisciplinary approach. Methods Researchers from four sectors (basic science, clinical sciences, health services and epidemiology/determinants of health) and representatives from various Canadian local, provincial, and federal stakeholder groups were invited to a two-day workshop. Five multi-disciplinary groups and stakeholders from each of three healthcare settings (long term, acute care and community) discussed research priorities for each of the settings. Five to ten research questions were identified for each setting. Results The research questions proposed ranged from risk factors and outcomes for different infections to the effect of nutrition on infection and the role of alternative and complementary medicine in treating infections. Health service issues included barriers to immunization, prolongation of hospital length of stay by infection, use of <b>care</b> <b>paths</b> for managing infections, and decision-making in determining the site of care for individuals with infections. Clinical questions included risk factor assessment for infection, the effectiveness of preventative strategies, and technology evaluation. Epidemiologic issues included the challenge of achieving a better understanding of respiratory infections in the community and determining the prevalence of colonization with multi-resistant bacteria. Conclusions The questions are of direct relevance to researchers {{in a wide variety of}} fields. Bringing together a multi-disciplinary group of researchers to frame and prioritize research questions about aging is feasible, participants valued the opinions of people working in other areas. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Lowering blood {{pressure}} reduces cardiovascular risk, yet hypertension is poorly controlled in diabetic patients. In {{a pilot study}} we demonstrated that a home {{blood pressure}} telemonitoring system, which provided self-care messages on the smartphone of hypertensive diabetic patients immediately after each reading, improved blood pressure control. Messages were based on <b>care</b> <b>paths</b> defined by running averages of transmitted readings. The present study tests the system’s effectiveness in a randomized, controlled trial in diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension. Of 244 subjects screened for eligibility, 110 (45 %) were randomly allocated to the intervention (n 55) or control (n 55) group, and 105 (95. 5 %) completed the 1 -year outcome visit. In the intention-to-treat analysis, mean daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure, the primary end point, decreased significantly only in the intervention group by 9. 115. 6 mmHg (SD; P 0. 0001), and the mean between-group difference was 7. 12. 3 mmHg (SE; P 0. 005). Furthermore, 51 % of intervention subjects achieved the guideline recommended target of 130 / 80 mmHg compared with 31 % of control subjects (P 0. 05). These improvements were obtained {{without the use of}} more or different antihypertensive medications or additional clinic visits to physicians. Providing self-care support did not affect anxiety but worsened depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (baseline, 4. 13. 76; exit, 5. 24. 30; P 0. 014).

40|$|Abstract Disease {{heterogeneity}} is {{as major}} issue in Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T 2 DM), and this patient inter-variability might not be sufficiently reflected by measurements of glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c). Β-cell dysfunction and β-cell death are initiating factors in development of T 2 DM. In fact, β-cells are known vanish prior {{to the development of}} T 2 DM, and autopsy of overt T 2 DM patients have shown a 60 % reduction in β-cell mass. As the decline in β-cell function and mass have been proven to be pathological traits in T 2 DM, methods for evaluating β-cell loss is becoming of more interest. However, evaluation of β-cell death or loss is currently invasive and unattainable {{for the vast majority of}} diabetes patients. Serological markers, reflecting β-cell loss would be advantageous to detect and monitor progression of T 2 DM. Biomarkers with such capacities could be neo-epitopes of proteins with high β-cell specificity containing post translational modifications. Such tools may segregate T 2 DM patients into more appropriate treatment groups, based on their β-cell status, which is currently not possible. Presently individuals presenting with adequately elevated levels of both insulin and glucose are classified as T 2 DM patients, while an important subdivision of those is pending, namely those patients with sufficient β-cell capacity and those without. This may warrant two very different treatment options and patient <b>care</b> <b>paths.</b> Serological biomarkers reflecting β-cell health status may also assist development of new drugs for T 2 DM and aid physicians in better characterization of individual patients and tailor individual treatments and patient care protocols. </p...|$|E

40|$|An updated edition for our popular Clinical Cases collection, {{this book}} is aimed medical {{students}} following the core curriculum in Australia and New Zealand; and the United Kingdom, junior doctors at resident or house officer level, and general practitioners. This handy, lab coat pocket-sized book broadly covers the whole syllabus for the medical student, and {{the whole range of}} obstetric and gynaecological problems likely to come into the path of the busy junior hospital doctor or general practitioner, {{but it is not a}} textbook providing simply a list of differential diagnoses and treatments. The approach has been developed from the experienced authors teaching of problem-based learning scenarios (PBLs) to clinical students. PBLs introduce students to typical clinical situations and then encourage those students to think about how they would take appropriate histories, examine, investigate and finally treat their patients. In this book, by using case histories that are more developed and complex, we aim to show readers in greater detail how women may present with particular conditions, and demonstrate what should take place in the way of consultation, investigations and treatment. However, by questioning our readers as we go along we also hope to encourage them to think about why they would choose a certain clinical course of action and to base their decisions firmly on current scientific evidence. In addition to the purely clinical aspects of the cases, the emotional, social and psychological aspects of the care of each woman is described. Each of the 50 case histories commences with a straightforward description following a woman through the clinical presentation of a particular condition. Along the way, important points in clinical examination and diagnosis, complications, investigations and management are incorporated into the text as a conversation with the reader, and essential points are highlighted in boxes. Being an Australian author team, tips are included for those junior doctors faced with obstetric or gynaecological problems in a smaller metropolitan or rural setting - facilities for care and the advice of senior practitioners may be more limited in such surroundings and different <b>care</b> <b>paths</b> may be more appropriate, especially in remote parts of Australia...|$|E

This study examines wait times along the <b>care</b> <b>path</b> from suspicious imaging study (Detection) to adjuvant chemotherapy initiation (Chemotherapy) for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who undergo surgical resection. MethodsA retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed in 2005 with NSCLC who underwent curative-intent surgery in Nova Scotia, Canada was conducted to abstract dates of care events (Detection, Surgery Consultation, Surgery, Medical Oncology [MO] Referral, MO Consultation and Chemotherapy) and patient characteristics. Multifactorial regression methods were used to identify statistically-significant cofactors associated with wait times at various resolutions of care intervals (low, intermediate, high). ResultsA median wait time of 141 days elapsed between Detection-Chemotherapy; and a median 107 and 52 days elapsed between Detection-Surgery and Surgery-Chemotherapy, respectively. A number of demographic, clinical, epidemiological, and system resource dependant factors influenced wait times at different resolutions, and were best detailed utilizing high resolution analysis. Wait time between MO referral-MO Consultation was inversely related to that experienced in the preceding interval of Surgery-MO Referral. ConclusionsThis study provides a first detailed examination of wait times experienced by NSCLC patients undergoing curative-intent surgery according to care interval definitions; demonstrates the value of high care interval resolution analysis to detect bottlenecks in access to care; and reports on the interdependence of elapsed times between care events along the <b>care</b> <b>path</b> for cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) is {{a common}} {{condition}} during or after pregnancy with pain and disability as most important symptoms. These symptoms have {{a wide range of}} clinical presentation. Most doctors perceive pregnancy related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) as ‘physiologic’ or ‘expected during pregnancy’, where no treatment is needed. As such women with PPGP mostly experience little recognition. However, many scientific literature describes PPGP as being severe with considerable levels of pain and disability and socio-economic consequences in about 20 % of the cases. Objectives: We aimed to (1) inform the gynecologist/obstetrician about the etiology, diagnosis, risk factors, and treatment options of PPGP and (2) to make a proposition for an adequate clinical <b>care</b> <b>path.</b> Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases and a check of reference lists for recent researches about the diagnosis, etiology, risk factors and treatment of PPGP. Results: Adequate treatment is based on classification in subgroups according to the different etiologic factors. The various diagnostic tests can help to make a differentiation in the several pelvic girdle pain syndromes and possibly reveal the underlying biomechanical problem. This classification can guide appropriate multidimensional and multidisciplinary management. A proposal for a clinical <b>care</b> <b>path</b> starts with recognition of gynecologist and midwife for this disorder. Both care takers can make a preliminary diagnosis of PPGP and should refer to a physiatrist, who can make a definite diagnosis.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the safety and}} complications of chest tube clamping, a retrospective chart review was conducted at Baylor University Medical Center's level I trauma center. The records of 243 patients with pneumothoraces, hemothoraces, or a combination were identified and analyzed; 134 patients underwent clamping according to the <b>care</b> <b>path,</b> and 109 did not. The demographic characteristics of age, gender, and mechanism of injury were similar in both groups, as was the frequency of pneumothoraces, hemothoraces, and combined hemo/pneumothoraces. Subsequent radiographs showing recurrence or patient symptoms were noted in 13 patients (9. 7 %), requiring unclamping. Nine patients (6. 7 %) who had passed the clamping trial prior to removal required reinsertion of a chest tube due to recurrent pneumothoraces. One clamped patient required urgent insertion of a second thoracostomy tube due to occlusive thrombus within the residing chest tube. No deaths were documented {{as a result of}} the <b>care</b> <b>path</b> or of clamping. Overall, the clamped chest tube allows for more definitive assessment of persistent occult air leaks based on a 6 -hour chest radiograph and avoidance of premature removal and did not appear to have any adverse effects on patient safety. Further refinements of the clamping procedure may be needed, as some patients still required reinsertion despite an absence of pneumothorax after a 6 -hour clamping trial. Given these data, a prospective study with clamping is warranted to evaluate whether or not such a system can increase the speed with which chest tubes are removed and decrease the length of stay while maintaining patient safety...|$|R

A 1 -day workshop was held to explore the perceptions of key actors regarding the challenges and priority interventions to improve CNCP management in primary care. Methods: Using the Chronic Care Model as a conceptual framework, physicians (n= 6), pharmacists (n= 6), nurses (n= 6), physiotherapists (n= 6), psychologists (n= 6), pain specialists (n= 6), patients (n= 3), family members (n= 3), decision makers and managers (n= 4), and pain researchers (n= 7) took part in seven focus groups and five nominal groups. Results: Challenges identified in focus group discussions were related to five dimensions: knowledge gap, “work in silos”, lack of awareness that CNCP represents an important clinical problem, difficulties in access to health professionals and services, and patient empowerment needs. Based on the nominal group discussions, the following priority interventions were identified: interdisciplinary continuing education, interdisciplinary treatment approach, regional expert leadership, creation and definition of <b>care</b> <b>paths,</b> and patient education programs.

40|$|Introduction: In {{chronic disease}} management, {{such as in}} chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD), technology can play an important role to increase the quality and efficiency of care. In the THeCS project, {{which is part of the}} large Dutch COMMIT programme, we aim to develop a trusted healthcare service to support patients’ self-management and a physically active lifestyle. Previous experiences in COPD telerehabilitation, using activity monitoring, ambulant feedback, online exercise programmes and teleconsultation [1 - 4] have been used as input for the development of the new service platform, following an iterative, user-centred design approach [5]. Stakeholders took part from the onset of the design process, by means of interviews, co-creation sessions and workshops. Methodology: The first prototype is being developed and consists of a webportal, with connection to an ambulant activity coach. The prototype includes the modules: 1) 	Activity coach, for ambulant activity measurement and real-time feedback on a smartphone to improve daily activity behaviour 2) 	Web-based exercise programme, for exercising at home 3) 	A symptom diary, for self-management of COPD exacerbations 4) 	A group forum, to exchange experiences with fellow patients The webportal also provides an overview of measured activity data from the activity coach, and an overview of measurements, questionnaires and diary to monitor progress and adapt treatment. In addition, the webportal provides treatment information, teleconsultation and digitized treatment card containing the patient’s appointments. The involved care professionals have access to the ‘professional webportal’, where they can manage e. g. <b>care</b> <b>paths</b> and patient measurements. Results: Previously developed telerehabilitation modules have shown the potential of supporting patients with COPD. Thirty-four COPD patients participated in a pilot RCT, using the activity coach and symptom diary for 1 month, and positive changes were observed for health status [1]. COPD patients also significantly changed their activity level in response to the motivational cues provided by the activity coach [2]. A telerehabilitation programme consisting of the activity coach, triage diary and online exercise programme, was implemented in primary and secondary care, and used for 9 months in a pilot RCT (n= 30) [3]. Another exercise-based telerehabilitation service consisted of an exercise programme and teleconsultation module. The service was delivered to the patients (n= 54) in two ways: as substitute (partly) of their pulmonary rehabilitation or as supplement to their pulmonary rehabilitation, [4] to investigate efficiency of healthcare. Discussion: The current prototype will be evaluated late 2013, regarding use, acceptance, usability and trust concepts. The healthcare service will be further developed based on the outcomes of the first evaluation. Subsequent studies will investigate clinical outcomes and care efficiency of the healthcare service. Conclusion: A healthcare service is being developed for application in COPD rehabilitation, based on both user needs and recent advances in COPD telerehabilitation. We expect that the healthcare service will improve care efficiency and will support patient self-management...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Maternity care is all care in {{relation}} to pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. In the Netherlands maternity care is provided by midwives and general practitioners (GPs) in primary care and midwives and gynecologists in secondary care. To be able to interpret women's experience {{with the quality of}} maternity care, it is necessary to take into account their 'care path', that is: their route through the care system. In the Netherlands a new tool is being developed to evaluate the quality of care from the perspective of clients. The tool is called: 'Consumer Quality Index' or CQI and is, within a standardized and systematic framework, tailored to specific health care issues. Within the framework of developing a CQI Maternity Care, data were gathered about the care women in the Netherlands received during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. In this paper the quality of maternity care in the Netherlands is presented, as experienced by women at different stages of their <b>care</b> <b>path.</b> Methods A sample of 1, 248 pregnant clients of four insurance companies, with their due date in early April 2007, received a postal survey in the third trimester of pregnancy (response 793). Responders to the first questionnaire received a second questionnaire twelve weeks later, on average four weeks after delivery (response 632). Based on care provider and place of birth the 'care path' of the women is described. With factor analysis and reliability analysis five composite measures indicating the quality of treatment by the care provider at different stages of the <b>care</b> <b>path</b> have been constructed. Overall ratings relate to eight different aspects of care, varying from antenatal care by a midwife or GP to care related to neonatal screening. Results 41. 5 percent of respondents remained in primary care throughout pregnancy, labor, birth and the postpartum period, receiving care from a midwife or general practitioner, 31. 3 % of respondents gave birth at home. The majority of women (58. 5 %) experienced referral from one care provider to another, i. e. from primary to secondary care or reverse, at least once. All but two percent of women had one or more ultrasound scans during pregnancy. The composite measures for the quality of treatment in different settings and by different care providers showed that women, regardless of parity, were very positive {{about the quality of the}} maternity care they received. Quality-of-treatment scores were high: on average 3. 75 on a scale ranging from 1 to 4. Overall ratings on a 0 – 10 scale for quality of care during the antenatal period and during labor, birth and the postpartum period were high as well, on average 8. 36. Conclusion The <b>care</b> <b>path</b> of women in maternity care was seldom straight forward. The majority of pregnant women switched from primary to secondary care and back at least once, during pregnancy or during labor and birth or both. The results of the quality measures indicate that the quality of care as experienced by women is high throughout the care system. But with regard to the care during labor and birth the quality of care scores are higher when women know their care provider, when they give birth at home, when they give birth in primary care and when they are assisted by their own midwife. </p...|$|R

This paper describes the MySAwH IoMT framework features and demonstrate how the IoMT, mobile and wearable technologies have been successfully exploited to provide: i) physicians with a continuous patient monitoring to measure the response to illness and the life quality improvement; ii) patients with an up to date insight of health conditions and a constant support via a direct communication with the health coaches...|$|R
40|$|Measurement of care time {{intervals}} is complex, being {{influenced by}} many factors. The {{definition of the}} care interval monitored can also bias the detection of changes in waits. The implications of using different care interval definitions to report wait times and identify delays in care provision were examined using a retrospective chart review of 637 women with surgically treated breast cancer who were referred to a cancer centre between September 1999 and 2000 or September 2003 and 2004. Overall waits between detection and adjuvant treatment increased by 12 days over the two periods, but their exact location and cause(s) could not be determined at such a low-resolution interval. At higher resolutions of care intervals, reporting the comprehensive sequence of care events, the prolongation was mainly associated with delayed access to surgery (4 days) and delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy (4 days). The latter went unnoticed when waits were reported at intermediate (referral to adjuvant treatment) and low (detection to adjuvant treatment) resolutions. Disease stage and type of first adjuvant treatment consistently and significantly influenced the length of waits. Comprehensive monitoring of the entire <b>care</b> <b>path</b> is essential to effectively prioritize interventions, assess their outcomes and optimise access to cancer care...|$|R
40|$|The ever-growing {{number of}} out-of-home {{children}} in Italy {{over the last}} decade has urged an assessment of the available care services. Although foster care is spreading rapidly, many young people are still housed in residential facilities. Reflection on residential care quality has intensified at both a national and an international level. This paper presents the results of a study on residential care facilities for children and young people in the region of Northern Italy (Lombardy). Four dimensions of ‘quality’ are considered: efficiency, effectiveness, participation in planning and intervention, and empowerment of children and their family relationships. The combined effects of these dimensions are defined as ‘relational quality’. The results show that residential care facilities are generally good, while Social Services resources often appear inadequate for interventions aimed at birth families (efficiency). The well-being of children in residential care facilities is high, even if they tend to move from one facility to another, rarely returning to their birth family (effectiveness). The involvement of children and their families at different stages of the <b>care</b> <b>path</b> is limited (participative approach). Finally, the most critical element is the failure to properly involve birth families (empowerment) ...|$|R

With a growing interest in value-based health care, there is an emphasis on establishing best practice, measuring out-comes, and improving clinical efficiencies. Best practice is a challenging concept with our growing knowledge base, and clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) help establish an approach to prioritize care and reduce practice variation. New chal-lenges are emerging with a larger population of insured patients and a mandate to coordinate care with a shared electronic health record, and these are coupled with a mas-sive growth in computing power. Care pathways (also called critical or clinical pathways) structure the implementation of CPGs, stratify high-risk patients, and provide the opportu-nity to achieve improved value. These are dynamic pro-cesses that are supervised by interdisciplinary teams and have the potential to evolve with new information gathered from each of the steps. As we emerge from single to group medical practices and hospitals to health systems, care path-ways will be critically needed for optimal population man-agement in health care.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{association}} between patient characteristics, reported problems with obtaining information and global evaluations of care among surgical patients. Using data from a large scale study of hospital care, a factor analysis of 30 information-relevant items was conducted with data from a sample of 3602 surgical patients; and correlation and multiple regression {{analyses were conducted to}} identify the relationships among information, patient characteristics and global evaluations of <b>care.</b> <b>Path</b> analysis was also used {{to determine the extent to}} which perceived control mediates the information-evaluation relationship. Four information factors were identified: surgical information, recovery information, general information and sensory information, and each was significantly related to global evaluations. Desire for involvement interacted with information received in determining patients' evaluations; and partial support was found for perceived control as a mediator of the information-evaluation link. The data indicate that the relationship between information and evaluations of quality is generalizable across patients, conditions and hospitals; and should be defined more broadly to include that which is given by a variety of providers, to family, and about medications and home recovery. Desire for involvement and perceived control must also be considered in understanding the value and impact of information.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe how indicators of the equity of access to health care according to socioeconomic conditions may be included in a performance evaluation system (PES) in the regional context level and in the planning and strategic control system of healthcare organisations. In particular, the paper investigates how the PES adopted, in the experience of the Tuscany region in Italy, indicators of vertical equity over time. Studies that testify inequality of access to health services often remain just a research output and are not used as targets and measurements in planning and control systems. After a brief introduction to the concept of horizontal and vertical equity in health care systems and equity measures in PES, the paper describes the ‘equity process’ by which selected health indicators declined by socioeconomic conditions were shared and used in the evaluation of health care institutions and in the CEOs' rewarding system, and subsequently analyses the initial results. Results on the maternal and child path and the chronicity <b>care</b> <b>path</b> not only show improvements in addressing health care inequalities, but also verify whether the health system responds appropriately to different population groups.

40|$|Thomas Heuyer, 1 Sonia Pavan, 2 Christine Vicard 1 1 Maladies Rares Info Services, 2 SPScienceCom, Paris, France Purpose: A {{barometer}} {{has been}} set up to provide better knowledge about the daily situation of French rare disease (RD) patients, their families and relatives, in order to contribute to the elaboration of improvement measures. This report focuses on the <b>care</b> and life <b>path</b> of RD patients. Patients and methods: A preliminary survey was carried out with three patients, five parents and three RD experts to identify the main hurdles and disruptions in the life path of RD patients. It was used to design a larger survey comprising 60 questions as well as open fields allowing free expression. Respondents (448) comprised patients, parents of RD children and close relatives of patients. The Percentage of Maximum Deviation, Yates’ correction for continuity and Fisher’s test were employed to compare the responses between groups. Results: Large disparities in the delays to obtain a diagnosis were identified ( 20 years), and longer delays were associated with negative perception of care conditions. While good interactions with education teams were reported (59 % of respondents), the professional situation of both patients and parents was strongly and negatively impacted by the disease (51 % did not work or stopped working). Three hundred respondents expressed various needs and psychological and personal issues were reported by 62 % and 75 % of respondents, respectively. Interestingly, the medical <b>care</b> <b>path</b> and daily life of RD patients were positively impacted by the follow-up in a specialized consultation, as reflected by changes in scores measured by our barometer (Fisher’s test, p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Some of the main hurdles and sources of disruption in the life path of RD patients were identified, as well as some positive outcomes. These data could serve not only as a background for further studies, but also to better adapt the support to real needs and to improve the synergies between the many people involved in the life path of RD patients.
