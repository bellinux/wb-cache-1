5|$|The {{wreck of}} the Mary Rose was rediscovered in 1971. It was raised in 1982 by the Mary Rose Trust, {{in one of the}} most complex and {{expensive}} projects in the history of maritime archaeology. The surviving section of the ship and thousands of recovered artefacts are of immeasurable value as a Tudor-era time capsule. The excavation and raising of the Mary Rose was a milestone in the field of maritime archaeology, comparable in complexity and <b>cost</b> <b>only</b> to the raising of the Swedish 17th-century warship Vasa in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Warner Brothers′ {{succession}} of gangster movie hits, in particular Little Caesar with Edward G. Robinson, culminated with the 1931 film The Public Enemy.

However, after the initial rushes, each was reassigned the other's part. The film <b>cost</b> <b>only</b> $151,000 to make, but it {{became one of the}} first low-budget films to gross $1million.|$|E

5|$|In {{each of the}} {{countries}} involved in the South American dreadnought arms race, movements arose that advocated {{the sale of the}} dreadnoughts to redirect the substantial amounts of money involved toward what they viewed as more worthy pursuits. These costs were rightfully viewed as enormous. After the Minas Geraes class was ordered, a Brazilian newspaper equated the initial purchase cost for the original three ships as equaling 3,125 miles of railroad tracks or 30,300 homesteads. Naval historian Robert Scheina put the price at £6,110,100 without accounting for ammunition, which was £605,520, or necessary upgrades to docks, which was £832,000. Costs for maintenance and related issues, which in {{the first five years of}} Minas Geraess and São Paulos commissioned lives was about 60 percent of the initial <b>cost,</b> <b>only</b> added to the already staggering sum of money. The two Rivadavias were purchased for nearly a fifth of the Argentine government's yearly income, a figure which did not include the later in-service costs. Historian Robert K. Massie rounded the figure to a full quarter of each government's annual income.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower than}} {{expected}} passenger numbers were {{partly due to}} competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took {{a large number of}} passengers away from the trains. The Daily Mirror noted at the end of April 1906 that the BS offered poor value for money compared to the equivalent motor bus service, which <b>cost</b> <b>only</b> 1d. per journey, and that passengers disliked the distances that they had to walk between the trains and the lifts. Such problems were not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface DR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenue generated from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E
5|$|Calls {{from the}} local {{community}} {{to build a new}} station at 178th Street occurred as early as 1932; several of these requests came from the Jamaica Estates Association. In June 1936, the association petitioned Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia for the extension. As early as 1936, the New York City Board of Transportation (predecessor to the New York City Transit Authority and the MTA) was evaluating construction of the station along with further eastward extensions of the line, with the board's 1940 budget allocating funding for the station. Under the 1940 plans, construction of the station was set to take place between 1941 and 1945. In January 1941, city councilman James A. Burke proposed extending the line to 178th Street, in order to relieve congestion at 169th Street. Burke believed that a station could be built within the existing tunnel and trackage and <b>cost</b> <b>only</b> $100,000, while engineers from the Board of Transportation stated it would require additional tunneling and new relay tracks extending to 184th Street. In July 1941, the Board of Transportation requested funding for a new express terminal station to replace 169th Street. Construction was delayed, however, due to material shortages caused by the Great Depression, and further delayed due to the onset of World War II.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Nolan Bushnell saw Spacewar {{running on a}} {{mainframe}} at the University of Utah {{where he was a}} student. Bushnell worked during the summer at Lagoon Amusement Park in Utah as a manager of the games department overseeing the arcade games, and when he saw Spacewar he believed that an arcade game version of the game would be very popular. The high price of computers capable of running the game, however, meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible. After graduating from college Bushnell worked as an engineer in California for Ampex, an electronics company that worked in audio and video recording technology. He also met researcher Jim Stein, who worked for Stanford University's Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project; he learned from him that Spacewar was running on the laboratory's PDP-6, and played the game against him there when visiting. Soon after, he saw an ad for the Data General Nova computer, which <b>cost</b> <b>only</b> US$4,000, and thought again about his Spacewar arcade game idea; he believed that at that price, if he were able to connect four monitors and coin slots to allow multiple games to run simultaneously, the game would be economically viable. He showed his office mate and fellow Ampex engineer Ted Dabney Spacewar at the Stanford laboratory, and the two agreed to work together to try and design a prototype of the game; Bushnell was more experienced with computers and digital engineering, while Dabney was more experienced with analog and hardware engineering, as he had been working on designing video processing and control circuits and power supplies.|$|E

25|$|On 25 October 2011 a {{commission}} of the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission revealed {{during a meeting}} calculations about the costs of recycling nuclear fuel for power generation.
