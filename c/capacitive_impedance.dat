At lower microwave current the steps cover a smaller range of voltage and at higher microwave current the steps become smaller and begin to move off the zero current axis. In a large array, every junction must generate a large zero crossing step and thus the microwave power must be adjusted to a value low enough to accommodate the one junction receiving the largest microwave drive. Thus, {{in order to obtain}} the largest voltage from the smallest number of junctions, an array standard requires a circuit design that can deliver nearly uniform microwave power to many thousands of junctions, all of which are connected in series.

40|$|The {{data rate}} of global on-chip {{interconnects}} (up to 10 mm) {{is limited by}} a large distributed resistance and capacitance. This thesis describes methods to increase the achievable data rate of global on-chip interconnects with minimal chip area and power consumption, while maintaining data integrity. The small RC bandwidth of global interconnects limits the achievable data rate. For highest bandwidth per area, all interconnect dimensions (width, spacing, height and oxide thickness) should be chosen equal and small. The bandwidth can be increased by choosing suitable termination <b>impedances.</b> A <b>capacitive</b> source <b>impedance</b> increases the bandwidth {{by a factor of}} three. In addition, the <b>capacitive</b> source <b>impedance</b> decreases power consumption in the interconnect. A small resistive load impedance also increases the bandwidth by a factor of three and decreases the dynamic power consumption. However, the static power consumption can still be high. In order to maintain data integrity, a low offset sense amplifier is used to restore the low voltage swing at the output of the interconnect to full-swing. Furthermore, differential interconnects are used to be robust against supply noise, substrate noise and crosstalk from crossing interconnects. Crosstalk from neighboring interconnects that run in parallel is canceled with a single twist in every even differential interconnect and a double twist in every uneven differential interconnect. The optimal positions of the twists depend on the termination impedances. A conventional transceiver in 0. 13 μm CMOS with an inverter for both the transmitter and thereceiver, achieves 550 Mb/s/ch over a 10 mm long uninterrupted differential interconnect.
