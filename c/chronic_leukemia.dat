The grade of such an increase is in the descending order of that in acute myelogenous <b>leukemia,</b> <b>chronic</b> myelogenous <b>leukemia,</b> acute lymphocytic leukemia, monocytic <b>leukemia</b> and <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia.</b> Xo(2) /K in comparison with that in the normal case is increased in acute myelogenous leukemia and monocytic <b>leukemia,</b> but in <b>chronic</b> myelogenous <b>leukemia</b> it is somewhat decreased, and in acute and <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> it is markedly decreased.

40|$|Background Previous Studies {{have shown}} {{increased}} familial risk for <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia.</b> In {{the most comprehensive}} study to date, we evaluated risk of <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> and lymphoproliferative disorders among First-degree relatives of <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> cases compared to first-degree relatives of controls. Design and Methods Population-based registry data from Sweden were used to evaluate outcomes in 26, 947 first-degree relatives of 9, 717 <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> patients (diagnosed 19583 8, 159 matched controls. Using a 2004) compared with 107, 223 first-degree relatives of 1 as marginal survival model, we calculated relative risks (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals measures of Familial aggregation. Results Compared to relatives of controls, relatives of <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> patients had an increased risk for <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> (RR= 8. 5, 6. 1 - 11. 7) and other non-Hodkin's lymphomas (NHLs) (RR= 1. 9, 1. 5 - 2. 3). Evaluating NHL subtypes, we found a striking excess of indolent B-cell NHL specifically lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and hairy cell leukemia. No excesses of aggressive B-cell or T-cell lymphomas were found. There was no statistical excess of Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or the precursor condition, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, among <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> relatives. Conclusions These familial aggregations are striking and provide novel clues to research designed to uncover early pathogenetic mechanisms in <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> including studies to identify germ line susceptibility genes. However, clinicians should counsel their <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> patients emphasizing that because the baseline population risks are low, the absolute risk for a first-degree relative to develop <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> or another indolent lymphoma is low.

40|$|Inactivation of the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated gene in <b>chronic</b> {{lymphocytic}} <b>leukemia</b> {{results in}} resistance to p 53 -dependent apoptosis and inferior responses to treatment with DNA damaging agents. Hence, p 53 -independent strategies {{are required to}} target Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-deficient <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia.</b> As Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated has been implicated in redox homeostasis, we investigated {{the effect of the}} Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> genotype on cellular responses to oxidative stress with a view to therapeutic targeting. We found that in comparison to Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-wild type <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia,</b> pro-oxidant treatment of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null cells led to reduced binding of NF-E 2 p 45 -related factor- 2 to antioxidant response elements and thus decreased expression of target genes. Furthermore, Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> cells contained lower levels of antioxidants and elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Consequently, Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia,</b> but not tumors with 11 q deletion or TP 53 mutations, exhibited differentially increased sensitivity to pro-oxidants both in vitro and in vivo. We found that cell death was mediated by a p 53 - and caspase-independent mechanism associated with apoptosis inducing factor activity. Together, these data suggest that defective redox-homeostasis represents an attractive therapeutic target for Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia...</b>|$|R
40|$|The role of T-cells in the {{pathogenesis}} of <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> has recently gained much attention due {{to the importance of}} the constant interaction between neoplastic B-cells with microenvironment substratum and T-cells. It is believed that these interactions modulate the clinical course of the disease, mainly through the regulation of the expansion, differentiation, and survival of <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> B-cells. Importantly, this crosstalk may also change the number, function, and memory phenotype of normal T-cells, thereby altering the amplitude and/or efficiency of adaptive immunity in <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> patients. The present study presents an overview on important aspects of this immunological crosstalk, particularly on the abnormalities of <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> B-cells and the alterations in normal T-cells, with focus on the CD 4 memory T-cell compartment that could offer survival signals to <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> B-cell clone(s) and contribute to the establishment and progression of the disease.

Background: Bortezomib {{has been successfully}} used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and has been proposed as a potential treatment for <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia.</b> In this study we investigated the mechanism by which bortezomib induces apoptosis in <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> cells. Design and Methods: Using western blot analysis, we monitored the regulation of BCL 2 family members, proteins of the unfolded protein response (endoplasmic reticulum stress response) and activation of caspases in relation to induction of apoptosis (measured by annexin-propidium iodide staining and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential) by bortezomib in <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> cells. Results: Bortezomib induced apoptosis through activation of the mitochondrial pathway independently of changes associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress. Perturbation of mitochondria was regulated by a rapid and transcription-independent increase of NOXA protein, which preceded release of cytochrome c, HtrA 2, Smac and activation of caspase- 9 and − 3. NOXA had a short half life (1 – 2 h) and was ubiquitinated on at least three primary lysine residues, resulting in proteasomal-dependent degradation. Down-regulation of NOXA, using short interfering RNA in <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> cells, decreased bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Finally bortezomib when combined with seliciclib resulted in a stronger and earlier increase in NOXA protein, caspase- 3 cleavage and induction of apoptosis in <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> cells. Conclusions: These results highlight a critical role for NOXA in bortezomib–induced apoptosis in <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> cells and suggest that this drug may become more efficient for the treatment of <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> if combined with other agents able to interfere with the basal levels of MCL 1. 1798...|$|R
