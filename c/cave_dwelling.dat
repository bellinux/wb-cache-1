5|$|There are spiders with {{a reduced}} number of eyes, of these those with six-eyes {{are the most}} {{numerous}} and are missing a pair of eyes on the anterior median line, others species have four-eyes and some just two. <b>Cave</b> <b>dwelling</b> species have no eyes, or possess vestigial eyes incapable of sight.|$|E
5|$|A few insects, such {{as members}} of the {{families}} Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent. The most familiar group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes. The function varies with some species using them to attract mates, while others use them to lure prey. <b>Cave</b> <b>dwelling</b> larvae of Arachnocampa (Mycetophilidae, fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands of silk.|$|E

Crane and Young Masbath, the son of one of the Horseman's victims, go to the <b>cave</b> <b>dwelling</b> of a reclusive witch. She reveals the location of the Tree of the Dead, which marks the Horseman's grave, as well as his portal into the natural, living world.|$|E

5|$|Other {{terrestrial}} invertebrates described from Puerto Rico include earthworms and <b>cave</b> <b>dwelling</b> animals. Eighteen {{native species}} of earthworm have been described, with 11 species {{belonging to the}} family Glossoscolecidae, 3 to the family Megascolecidae, and 4 to the family Exxidae. Seventy-eight invertebrate species are known to inhabit Puerto Rico's caves. Six of these species are restricted to the Antilles, 23 come from North America and 23 are endemic to Puerto Rico. Only two of the species are confirmed as troglobites, or restricted to caves. Forty-five percent of the species are predators while the remaining 55% are guano scavengers, detritivores and herbivores. It is believed that most of this fauna arrived at Puerto Rico in the Pleistocene.|$|E
25|$|Cockroaches {{are most}} common in {{tropical}} and subtropical climates. Some species are in close association with human dwellings and widely found around garbage or in the kitchen. Cockroaches are generally omnivorous {{with the exception of}} the wood-eating species such as Cryptocercus; these roaches are incapable of digesting cellulose themselves, but have symbiotic relationships with various protozoans and bacteria that digest the cellulose, allowing them to extract the nutrients. The similarity of these symbionts in the genus Cryptocercus to those in termites are such that it has been suggested that they are more closely related to termites than to other cockroaches, and current research strongly supports this hypothesis of relationships. All species studied so far carry the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont bacterium Blattabacterium, with the exception of Nocticola australiensis, an Australian <b>cave</b> <b>dwelling</b> species without eyes, pigment or wings, and which recent genetic studies indicates are very primitive cockroaches.|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} {{diversity of}} gall forming insects are {{found among the}} flies, principally in the family Cecidomyiidae (gall midges). Many flies (most importantly in the family Agromyzidae) lay their eggs in the mesophyll tissue of leaves with larvae feeding between the surfaces forming blisters and mines. Some families are mycophagous or fungus feeding. These include the <b>cave</b> <b>dwelling</b> [...] Mycetophilidae (fungus gnats) whose larvae are the only diptera with bioluminescence. The Sciaridae are also fungus feeders. Some plants are pollinated by fungus feeding flies that visit fungus infected male flowers.|$|E

2500|$|Hakuin's early extreme exertions {{affected}} his health, {{and at one}} point in his young life he fell ill for almost two years, experiencing what would now probably be classified as a nervous breakdown by Western medicine. He called it Zen sickness, and sought the advice of a Taoist <b>cave</b> <b>dwelling</b> hermit named Hakuyu, who prescribed a visualization and breathing practice which eventually relieved his symptoms. [...] From this point on, Hakuin put a great deal of importance on physical strength and health in his Zen practice, and studying Hakuin-style Zen required a great deal of stamina. Hakuin often spoke of strengthening the body by concentrating the spirit, and followed this advice himself. Well into his seventies, he claimed to have more physical strength than he had at age thirty, being able to sit in zazen meditation or chant sutras for an entire day without fatigue. [...] The practices Hakuin learned from Hakuyu are still passed down within the Rinzai school.|$|E
