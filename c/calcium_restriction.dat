40|$|Calcium {{deficiency}} {{is considered}} to increase intracellular calcium level; thus {{the aim of the}} current study was to elucidate whether dietary <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> enhanced exercise-induced oxidative stress in rat diaphragm. Twenty male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to either a control group or a group subjected to 1 mo of <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction.</b> In addition, each group was subsequently subdivided into rested or acutely exercised group. Dietary <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> significantly (P &# 60; 0. 05) upregulated the activities of manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn-SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) but not catalase. Acute exercise, in addition to <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction,</b> decreased both SOD isoenzymes in the diaphragm of calcium-restricted rats (P &# 60; 0. 05). On the other hand, <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> resulted in increased Gpx mRNA expression (P &# 60; 0. 05). In control rats, acute exercise significantly (P &# 60; 0. 05) increased the expressions of both SOD mRNAs, whereas in the calcium-restricted rats, it increased that of Mn-SOD mRNA (P &# 60; 0. 05) but decreased that of Gpx mRNA (P &# 60; 0. 05). Furthermore, reactive carbonyl derivative, a marker of protein oxidation, was significantly greater in the calcium-restricted rats than in the control rats after acute exercise (P &# 60; 0. 05). The results suggest that antioxidant enzymes in rat diaphragm were upregulated in response to an increased oxidative stress by dietary <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> but that upregulation is not enough to cope with exercise-induced further increase of oxidative stress...|$|E

Adv. Exerc. Sports Physiol., Vol. 6, No. 3 pp 85 - 89, 2000. The {{purpose of}} {{current study was}} to {{elucidate}} wheter dietary <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> enhances exercise-induced oxidative stress in rat heart. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were assinged randomly to either the control (c) or the calcium-restricted (1 month) (R) rats. Each group was subdivided into non-exercised (CR. RR) or acutely exercised (CE, RE) groups. The level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), a marker of lipid peroxidation, was significantly greater in the RR rats than in the CR rats, and acute exercise elevated TBARS level only in the C group. On the other hand, reactive carbonyl significantly increased afrer exhaustive exercise in the R group, {{but not in the}} C group. Next the levels of major antioxidant enzymes [Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD). Cu. Zn-SOD. glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and catalase (CAT) ] in heart was determined. Dietary <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> sugnificantly decreased immunoreacive Mn-SOD and Cu. Zn-SOD contents in addition to Mn-SOD activity. Acute exercise significantly decreased Cu. Zu-SOD content only in the C rats. Meanwhile, GPX and CAT activities were unchanged throughout the experiment. The results obtained suggest that dietary <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> induces an increase of oxidative stress in rat heat, possibly attributable to a decrease in SOD isoenzyme levels, especially in Mn-SOD activity, and that exhaustive exercise enhances such an oxidative stress...|$|E

Attempts have been made to delay the onset of egg production in the fowl by feeding pre-laying diets deficient in calcium. <b>Calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> had no apparent effect on sexual development and did not delay the time· of first oviposition. Low calcium diets were used at a later date to halt egg production firstly just after peak production and secondly {{towards the end of the}} first laying year. Egg production was depressed markedly but never completely ceased, and remained at a low level until calcium restrictions were lifted whereupon a rapid rise returned egg production to levels comparable to egg production rates of non calcium restricted control hens. Comparisons between egg production, egg weight, shell weight and a measure of shell quality (shell weight per unit surface area of egg) revealed trends towards improved shell production and shell quality following <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> but little else. There was only a small number of significant differences. Egg production pauses induced by low dietary calcium were thought to be unsatisfactory as substitutes for force moulting. <b>Calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> caused declines in food consumption and body weight. While food consumption returned to levels equivalent to food consumption of non calcium restricted hens after <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction,</b> body weight in general did not. Calculations of the calcium loss from the body of calcium restricted hens via egg·shell production show that extremely severe depletion occurs unless egg prvduction is stopped or at least egg shell production is stopped. Such depletion of calcium has greatest effects on the skeleton and damage to the bones, particularly of the legs, may result.

Four groups of animals were fed either a low-Ca, semisynthetic diet (0. 1 % Ca) or the same diet supplemented with 0. 8 % Ca (normal diet). The caloric intake was similar in all groups. Two groups (low-Ca and normal diet) were used as controls, and two groups (low-Ca and normal diet) received 100 mg/l Cd (as CdCl 2) in drinking water. Cd levels in liver, kidney, spleen and red cells were measured in all animals after 8 weeks of treatment. Concomitantly, Mt levels in plasma, liver and kidney were evaluated by radioimmunoassay. Ca deficiency entailed marked and significant increases in accumulation of Cd and synthesis of Mt in all assayed tissues. It is concluded that dietary Ca restriction, independent of caloric intake, enhances Cd intestinal absorption and tissue accumulation, which is followed by increased tissue Mt synthesis...|$|R

However, how genetics affect the adaptation response of bone parameters to dietary calcium (Ca) restriction is unknown. 11 inbred strains of mice were fed adequate (0. 5 %) or low (0. 25 %) Ca diets from 4 - 12 weeks {{of age and}} were evaluated for gene-by-diet interactions affecting bone structure at the femur and lumbar spine. We observed that genetics and diet main effects as well as gene-by-diet interactions significantly affected femur trabecular and cortical bone, and lumbar spine trabecular bone microCT parameters. There were no significant correlations between basal and adaptation parameters in femur or lumbar spine. Adaptation of lumbar spine trabecular bone parameters was smaller compared to adaptation observed in the femur trabecular bone. However, the adaptation parameters in these two bone sites were significantly and positively correlated. We conclude that (1) genetic controls of basal and adaptive bone parameters are distinct; (2) trabecular bone in lumbar spine is more resistant to <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> than the trabecular bone in distal femur; (3) similar genetic forces affect the adaptation response in distal femur and lumbar spine trabecular bone.

In the present work we addressed the question if bitter taste receptors might also be expressed in other epithelial tissues as well. By staining a tissue microarray with 45 tissue spots from healthy human donors with an antibody directed against the best characterized bitter taste receptor TAS 2 R 38, we observed an unexpected strong TAS 2 R 38 expression in the amniotic epithelium, syncytiotrophoblast and decidua cells of the human placenta. To analyze the functionality we first determined the TAS 2 R 38 expression in the placental cell line JEG- 3. Stimulation of these cells with diphenidol, a clinically used antiemetic agent that binds TAS 2 Rs including TAS 2 R 38, demonstrated the functionality of the TAS 2 Rs by inducing <b>calcium</b> influx. <b>Restriction</b> enzyme based detection of the TAS 2 R 38 gene allele identified JEG- 3 cells as PTC (phenylthiocarbamide) -taster cell line.

40|$|Idiopathic hypercalciuria: Association with {{isolated}} hematuria {{and risk}} for urolithiasis in children. A prospective multicenter {{study was designed}} to determine the frequency and prognostic importance of hypercalciuria in children with hematuria. Urinary calcium excretion was examined in 215 patients with unexplained isolated hematuria (no proteinuria, urolithiasis, infection or systemic disorder). Hypercalciuria (urinary calcium excretion > 4 mg/kg/day) was identified in 76 patients (35 %). Compared to patients with normal urinary calcium excretion, children with hematuria and hypercalciuria were characterized by male preponderance, white race, family history of urolithiasis, gross hematuria and calcium oxalate crystals. Renal biopsies were performed in 10 patients with urinary calcium excretion 0. 4 to 2. 5 mg/kg/day; three had IgA glomerulonephritis, three had glomerular basement membrane thinning, one had proliferative glomerulonephritis and three were normal. Renal biopsies in three patients with hypercalciuria showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, hereditary nephritis or no abnormalities. Oral calcium loading tests showed renal hypercalciuria in 26 patients, absorptive hypercalciuria in 15 patients and were not diagnostic in 35 patients. Serum parathyroid hormone, bicarbonate and phosphorus and urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations were similar in the three groups of hypercalciuric patients.

These changes recovered partially upon phosphorus <b>restriction.</b> <b>Calcium</b> absorption and gene expression of calbindin-D 9 k were decreased in uremia and were also improved by phosphorus restriction. In uremia, intestinal spermidine/spermine N 1 -acetyl-transferase activity was decreased, while ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and its gene expression were potentiated. Enhancement of c-fos and c-jun gene expressions was also observed in uremia. These phenomena suggest that the intestinal villus may proliferate in uremia. Phosphorus restriction prevented increases in the expression of ODC, c-fos and c-jun observed in uremia. Since phosphorus restriction caused a rise in the serum 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D level, the role of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D in uremia-induced intestinal dysfunction was examined. A single injection of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 to uremic rats caused an increase in the steady-state calbindin-D 9 k mRNA level, and decreases in steady state c-fos and ODC mRNA levels, suggesting that the deficiency of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 is responsible for intestinal dysfunction in uremia.

Ovx rats had lower intercepts for the relationships between calcium consumption and both calcium balance (P < 0 · 005) and intestinal calcium absorption (P < 0 · 005) compared with sham rats, but 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D was not reduced in Ovx rats. The magnitude of adaptation to dietary <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> was unaffected by ovariectomy. Intestinal calcium absorption was stimulated by an equivalent amount in sham and Ovx rats following 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D administration, although this did not reach statistical significance for sham (sham, t= 1 · 91, n. s.; Ovx, t= 3 · 18, P < 0 · 05).

40|$|Moderate energy {{restriction}} in young, exercising women attenuates {{the positive}} effects of exercise on bone density. Studies have shown that in the absence of adequate levels of circulating estrogen, there may not be enough functional estrogen receptor-a (ER-a) to respond adequately to loading. The experiment described in this document is significant because this model has not been explored under conditions of energy restriction (EnR) which are known to reduce circulating estrogen levels; it has been tested only in ovariectomized animals. The central hypothesis of this research is that reductions in estrogen due to EnR limit the ability of bone to respond to mechanical loading (LOAD) through a down-regulation of ER-a. Study one determined which nutrient?s (<b>calcium</b> or energy) <b>restriction</b> (- 40 percent) had the greatest negative effects on the skeletal integrity of exercising female rats and whether exercise (EX) could mitigate these deleterious changes. EnR caused detrimental effects in many of the structural properties of bone; however EX attenuated losses in cancellous bone. Study two ascertained whether EX maintained cancellous bone mass in female rats subjected to graded EnR (- 20 or - 40 percent) and whether changes in endocrine factors were related. EX preserved cancellous bone volume and osteoblast activity under both levels of EnR, in addition to total body lean mass and bone mineral content. A similar maintenance of serum insulin-like growth factor and estradiol occurred in the EX EnR(40 percent) group suggesting that these changes {{may be related to the}} protective effects of EX. Study three determined the effects of 40 percent EnR on bone formation rate to LOAD in young adult female rats and tracked alterations in ovarian function (estradiol). Although higher than non-loaded animals, the response of bone to LOAD in EnR animals was dampened in comparison to energy-replete animals. The experiments described in this document are significant because these are the first experiments to explore the relationship between EnR and estrogen levels on cancellous bone response to LOAD. This is particularly important for physically active, energy restricted women because cancellous bone in these women will not experience the same effects of loading which can increase their risk for developing osteoporosis...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that about 90 percent of urinary stones contain calcium as main component. We studied calcium {{metabolism}} in urolithiasis patients from endocrinological aspects. In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, which accompanies urinary stones frequently, positive correlation could be demonstrated between excretion of urinary cyclic AMP and the serum parathyroid hormone value (p< 0. 01). On the other hand, excretion of the urinary cyclic AMP in urolithiasis patients without endocrinologic and metabolic disorders correlated negatively with urinary excretion of calcium. Therefore in hypercalciuric stone formers parathyroid function seems to be somewhat suppressed in comparison with the normal control. These hypercalciuric patients exhibited no changes in cyclic AMP excretion and serum PTH but an increase in serum calcitonin by calcium loading after fasting.

These animals were sacrificed three days after UNI-NX and CRG of the remaining kidney was assessed by kidney wt, RNA and DNA gains, and by 3 H-thymidine incorporation. The degree of CRG was enhanced in animals given a low dietary calcium and, conversely, was decreased in those receiving a phosphorus–poor diet. In thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rats, PTH administration resulted in a dose proportional stimulation of CRG.

Because the serum calcium level failed to return to normal after two weeks of hydration and a low calcium diet, and because of the inability to distinguish this syndrome from primary hyperparathyroidism, two of the four patients underwent neck exploration. Four normal parathyroid glands were histologically proven in each, and at autopsy in a third patient, {{there was no evidence of}} parathyroid hyperplasia or adenoma. Hypercalcemia eventually resolved in all {{patients with}} a low-calcium diet for as long as six months. Of the several features of MAS, hypercalcemia, alkalosis in the presence of azotemia, a history of increased calcium and alkali intake, and a response to dietary <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> are helpful in differentiating this syndrome from primary hyperparathyroidism. Laboratory tests in patients with MAS may be confusing and the return to normocalcemia in response to a calcium deficient diet may be delayed...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Epidemiological {{studies suggest}} an {{association}} between reduced calcium uptake and hypertension, while clinical trials and rat experiments indicate a small but significant hypotensive effect with oral calcium supplements. These data imply that calcium deficiency has a role in genetic hypertension. We reasoned that if the hypothesis is correct, the hypertension should be aggravated by further reducing calcium balance but attenuated by augmenting calcium balance. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the blood pressure response in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) as calcium balance was decreased by dietary restriction of calcium or increased by supplementation with magnesium or la, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol). A low calcium diet within the physiological range did not accentuate the hypertension in SHR during the 11 weeks of treatment, even though calcium balance was reduced by half. Similar results were obtained with dietary <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> in parathyroidectomized SHR, which excludes any offsetting effects of changes in parathyroid hormone levels. Conversely, 7 weeks of a high magnesium diet, which increased calcium balance without reducing PO 4 balance, did not correct the hypertension of SHR. Similarly, long-term administration of calcitriol failed to reduce the blood pressure of parathyroidectomized SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls, {{despite the presence of}} increased serum calcium levels comparable t...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Williams-Beuren {{syndrome}} (WBS) {{is a rare}} {{genetic disorder}} caused by the deletion of 26 - 28 genes on chromosome 7. Fifteen percent of WBS patients present with hypercalcaemia during infancy, which is generally mild and resolves spontaneously {{before the age of}} 4 years. The mechanisms underlying the transient hypercalcaemia in WBS are poorly understood. Case: We report a case of severe symptomatic hypercalcaemia in a patient with WBS, in which treatment with mild <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction,</b> hyperhydration and repeated bisphosphonate administration only resulted in short-lasting effects. Long-term lowering of serum calcium was only achieved after reducing calcium and vitamin D intake to the bare minimum. Conclusions: This case illustrates the potential severity of hypercalcaemia in WBS, and demonstrates that both the cause as well as the solution of this problem may be found in the intestinal absorption of calcium. We hypothesise that the phenotypical resemblance between WBS and transient idiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia can be explained by similarities in the underlying genetic defect. Patients suffering from transient infantile hypercalcaemia were recently described to have mutations in CYP 24 A 1, the key enzyme in 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 degradation. In the light of this new development we discuss the role of one of the deleted genes in WBS, Williams syndrome transcription factor (WSTF), in the etiology of hypercalcaemia in WBS...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{study the}} effect of {{short-term}} dietary calcium deficiency on the biomechanical properties of femurs in ovariectomized rats. Methods Sham operated and OVX rats were divided into four groups based on the dietary calcium level 5 weeks after the operation:Sham+NCD(normal calcium diet) (SN); Sham+LCD (low calcium diet) (SL); OVX+NCD (ON); OVX+LCD (OL). Another group (C) was taken as normal control. Two weeks later, urine specimens were collected and blood {{was taken from the}} abdominal aorta. Femurs were collected and stored at - 20 ℃ for three-point bending test in the diaphysis. Protein expression in proximal femur was detected by Western blot. Results Two-way ANOVA anslysis showed that the levels of serum ALP (P< 0. 001) and urine DPD (P< 0. 01) were significantly elevated after OVX, and femoral elastic modulus (P< 0. 05) and toughness (P< 0. 05) was reduced. Significant decrease of biomechanical markers, stiffness, energy absorption and toughness was observed in OL group, but not in those with short-term low calcium intake only. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression of proximal femur in LCD group was higher than that in NCD group. Conclusions Active bone turnover is observed in ovariectomized rats which can be aggravated by short-term dietary calcium deficiency. <b>Calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> has certain influence on bone mineral metabolism.

40|$|Abstract: Geological {{substrates}} and {{air pollution}} affect the availability of calcium to mammals in many habitats, including the Adirondack Mountain Region (Adirondacks) of the United States. Mammalian insectivores, such as shrews, may be particularly restricted in environments with low calcium. We examined the consequences of <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> on the least shrew (Cryptotis parva) in the laboratory. We maintained one group of shrews (5 F, 5 M) on a mealworm diet with a calcium concentration comparable to beetle larvae collected in the Adirondacks (1. 1 ± 0. 3 mg/g) and another group (5 F, 3 M) on a mealworm diet with a calcium concentration almost 20 times higher (19. 5 ± 5. 1 mg/g). Animals were given no access to mineral sources of calcium, such as snail shell or bone. We measured running speed and performance in a complex maze over 10 weeks. Shrews on the high-calcium diet made fewer errors in the maze than shrews on the low-calcium diet (F 1, 14 = 12. 8, p < 0. 01). Females made fewer errors than males (F 1, 14 = 10. 6, p < 0. 01). Running speeds did not markedly vary between diet groups or sexes, {{though there was a}} trend toward faster running by shrews on the high calcium diet (p = 0. 087).

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of pediatric urolithiasis varies from 0. 01 – 0. 03 %. Urolithiasis {{may be caused}} by anatomical, metabolic and environmental factors. Recurrence varies between 16 to 67 %, and it is frequently associated with metabolic abnormalities. The objective of the present work was the identification of risk factors that promote urolithiasis in a child population. Methods: This study included 162 children with urolithiasis and normal renal function (mean age 7. 5 years). Risk factors were investigated in two stages. In the first stage, 24 -hour urine, and blood samples were analyzed to assess metabolic parameters and urinary tract infection. During the second stage, the effect of <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> and a calcium load on renal Ca excretion were evaluated. Data were statistically analyzed. Results: Urolithiasis was observed in 0. 02 % of children, 50 % of them with family history of urinary stones. There were multiple risk factors for urolithiasis including hypocitraturia (70 %), hypomagnesuria (42 %), hypercalciuria (37 %; in 11 / 102 was by intestinal hyperabsorption, in 13 / 102 was unclassified. Ca resorption or renal Ca leak were not detected). We also detected alkaline urine (21 %), systemic metabolic acidosis (20 %), urinary infections (16 %), nephrocalcinosis with urolithiasis (11 %), oliguria (8 %), urinary tract anomalies, hyperuricosemia and hypermagnesemia (7 % each one), hypercalcemia (6 %), hyperoxaluria (2 %) and hypercystinuria (0. 61 %). Conclusions: Hypocitraturia and hypomagnesuria were the most frequent risk factors associated with urolithiasis, followed by hypercalciuria. High PTH values were excluded.

40|$|Agents {{that lower}} {{extracellular}} calcium concentration (EGTA) or modulate calcium transport (lanthanum or D 600) {{have been applied}} to dividing stamen hair cells of Tradescantia and analyzed {{for their ability to}} change the following: (a) the time required to progress from nuclear envelope breakdown to the onset of anaphase (metaphase transit time), (b) the time required to progress from anaphase to the initiation of the cell plate, and (c) the rate of chromosome motion in anaphase. Control cells complete metaphase in 32 min, initiate a cell plate in 19 min, and display a chromosome motion rate of 1. 45 micron/min. If cells are treated with a calcium-EGTA buffer (pCa 8) for 4 h, the metaphase transit time is increased to 53 min without any change in the time of cell plate formation or the rate of chromosome motion. Lanthanum and D 600, under conditions in which their access to the plasmalemma has been facilitated by pretreating the cells with cutinase, also markedly extend metaphase and in several instances permanently arrest cells. Lanthanum, however, produce little or no change in cell plate initiation or the rate of chromosome motion. Microscopic observations of the mitotic apparatus in calcium-stressed cells reveal normal chromatin condensation and metaphase progression. Chromosomes partly untwine but remain attached at their kinetochores. It is suggested that a flux of calcium, derived from the extracellular compartment, may cause the final splitting of sister chromosomes and trigger the onset of anaphase. However, once anaphase has begun, chromosome motion and cell plate initiation proceed normally even under conditions of extracellular <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction...</b>|$|E
40|$|Secondary {{hyperparathyroidism}} (HPT) {{is common}} among {{patients with chronic}} kidney disease (CKD) 1 - 3. The disorder develops early {{during the course of}} CKD due primarily to disturbances in vitamin D metabolism that alter calcium homeostasis systemically and lead to adaptive increases in the synthesis and secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands 4. Impairments in the synthesis of calcitriol, or 1, 25 -dihy-droxyvitamin D, by the diseased kidney play an essential role in the pathogenesis of secondary HPT due to their adverse effect on intestinal calcium absorption 4, 5. Calcitriol regulates the expression of several pro-teins that mediate intestinal calcium transport 6, 7. Among them are the calbindins and two constitutively activated calcium channels that belong to the vanilloid family of transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins, TRPV- 5 and TRPV- 68 - 10. The levels of expression of these key molecu-lar determinants of epithelial calcium transport are reduced in intestinal cells when serum calcitriol levels decline due to CKD 8, 11. Accordingly, defects in intestinal calcium absorption are a prominent feature among patients with mild to moderate CKD, and they are largely responsible for the hypocalciuria that characterizes the disorder 12 - 15. As in other clinical conditions such as nutritional vitamin D defi-ciency and dietary <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> where intestinal cal-cium absorption is suboptimal, secondary HPT represents an appropriate adaptive response that attenuates calcium excretion in the urine and mobilizes calcium from bone, changes that serve to maintain serum calcium concentra-tions and to preserve calcium homeostasis systemically 4...|$|E
40|$|Regulation {{of fluid}} and dietary intake habits is {{essential}} in comprehensive preventive management of urolithiasis. However, despite large body of epidemiological database, there is dearth of good quality prospective interventional studies in this regard. Often there is conflict in pathophysiological basis and actual clinical outcome. We describe conflicts, controversies and lacunae in current literature in fluid and dietary modifications in prevention of urolithiasis. Adequate fluid intake {{is the most important}} conservative strategy in urolithiasis-prevention; its positive effects are seen even at low volumes. Of the citrus, orange provides the most favorable pH changes in the urine, equivalent to therapeutic alkaline citrates. Despite being richest source of citrate, lemon does not increase pH significant due to its acidic nature. Fructose, animal proteins and fats are implicated in contributing to obesity, which is an established risk factor for urolithiasis. Fructose and proteins also contribute to lithogenecity of urine directly. Sodium restriction is commonly advised since natriuresis is associated with calciuresis. <b>Calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> is not advisable for urolithiasis prevention. Adequate calcium intake is beneficial if taken with food since it reduces absorption of dietary oxalate. Increasing dietary fiber does not protect against urolithiasis. Evidence for pyridoxine and magnesium is not robust. There is no prospective interventional study evaluating effect of many dietary elements, including citrus juices, carbohydrate, fat, dietary fiber, sodium, etc. Due to lack of good-quality prospective interventional trials it is essential to test the findings of pathophysiological understanding and epidemiological evidence.

40|$|The VX 2 carcinoma-bearing rabbit is {{an animal}} model for tumor-induced hypercalcemia, {{thought to be}} due to {{increased}} bone destruction effected by prostaglandin E 2. The present experiments suggest that the pathophysiology of the hypercalcemia differs from that previously proposed. Tumor was transplanted intramuscularly into 2. 5 - to 3 -kg male New Zealand White rabbits, which were conditioned to a 1. 5 % calcium diet and treated with daily subcutaneous injections of dichloromethane diphosphonate (10 mg. kg- 1. day- 1), a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, or 0. 9 % NaCl (2 ml. kg- 1. day - 1). The diphosphonate had no significant effect on plasma Ca 2 + in either group. After day 31, half the animals of each group were fed a calcium-free diet. This normalized the plasma Ca 2 + in each VX 2 -bearing rabbit within 3 to 4 days but had little effect in control rabbits. In a second series of experiments, VX 2 -bearing rabbits maintained on standard rabbit chow were treated for 11 days with parenteral indomethacin (30 [...] 60 mg/day) or 0. 9 % NaCl. Although indomethacin normalized the markedly elevated urinary excretion of prostaglandin E 2, both treatment groups became severely hypercalcemic. Dietary <b>calcium</b> <b>restriction</b> promptly restored to normal the plasma Ca 2 + concentration. In a third series of experiments, rabbits were fed standard rabbit chow and treated with oral indomethacin (40 mg/day) while control-rabbits were pair fed in identical chow. Transplantation of VX 2 tumor into both groups caused hypercalcemia. We conclude that the hypercalcemia produced by this tumor strain is indomethacin resistant and dependent on an increase in gastrointestinal calcium absorption, not on skeletal calcium mobilization...|$|E
