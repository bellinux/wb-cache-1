2500|$|Sets {{of surface}} {{measurements}} are important data to meteorologists. They give {{a snapshot of}} a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a weather station, a ship or a weather buoy. The measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables. Usually, temperature, pressure, wind measurements, and humidity are the variables that are measured by a thermometer, barometer, anemometer, and hygrometer, respectively. Professional stations may also include air quality sensors (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, dust, and smoke), <b>ceilometer</b> (cloud ceiling), falling precipitation sensor, [...] flood sensor, lightning sensor, microphone (explosions, sonic booms, thunder), pyranometer/pyrheliometer/spectroradiometer (IR/Vis/UV photodiodes), rain gauge/snow gauge, scintillation counter (background radiation, fallout, radon), seismometer (earthquakes and tremors), transmissometer (visibility), and a GPS clock for data logging. Upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting. The most widely used technique is launches of radiosondes. Supplementing the radiosondes a network of aircraft collection is organized by the World Meteorological Organization.|$|E

The Remote Miniature Weather Station (RMWS), from System Innovations, is an air-droppable {{version with}} a lightweight, {{expendable}} and modular system with two components: a meteorological (MET) sensor and a <b>ceilometer</b> (cloud ceiling height) with limited MET. The basic MET system is surface-based and measures wind speed and direction, horizontal visibility, surface atmospheric pressure, air temperature and relative humidity.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the particulate {{characteristics of a}} haze episode, data from two <b>ceilometers</b> with wavelengths of 532 nm and 910 nm, respectively, were studied intensively. By combining {{the data from the}} <b>ceilometers</b> with data from a sounding balloon, an automatic meteorological station, and a Grimm 180 PM instrument, analyses of the haze process of a short haze event were performed. The results showed that the relatively calm weather conditions were favorable to the occurrence of the haze and that higher relative humidity had a great influence on visibility. The extinction profiles from the <b>ceilometers</b> reflected the existence of an inverted structure of the temperature profiles and demonstrated the extinction differences at two different wavelengths. Because extinction has a positive correlation with relative humidity, the effect of hygroscopic growth was analyzed at the two different wavelengths. As hygroscopic growth of the particles proceeded, the longer wavelength became more sensitive to the large particles, and vice versa. The hygroscopic growth factor and the Angstrom exponent showed a negative correlation, and the correlation coefficients at 532 nm and 910 nm were 0. 54 and 0. 86, respectively. The accumulation mode particles were more stable through time than the coarse mode particles, and the variation of the coarse mode particles coincided well with the variation of the Angstrom exponent from the two <b>ceilometers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} of the depth of daytime and nighttime mixing layers must be known very accurately to relate boundary-layer concentrations of gases or particles to upstream fluxes. The mixing-height is parametrized in numerical weather prediction models, so improving the {{determination of}} the mixing height will improve the quality of the estimated gas and particle budgets. Datasets of mixing-height diurnal cycles with high temporal and spatial resolutions are sought by various end users. Lidars and <b>ceilometers</b> provide vertical profiles of backscatter from aerosol particles. As aerosols are predominantly concentrated in the mixing layer, lidar backscatter profiles can be used to trace the depth of the mixing layer.

50|$|Automated airport weather {{stations}} use an upward-pointing laser beam <b>ceilometer</b> {{to detect the}} amount and height of clouds. The laser is pointed upward, and the time required for reflected light {{to return to the}} station allows for the calculation of the height of the cloud base. Because of the limited coverage area (the laser can only detect clouds directly overhead), the system computer calculates a time-averaged cloud cover and ceiling, which is reported to external users. To compensate for the danger of rapidly changing sky cover, the averaging is weighted toward the first 10 minutes of the 30-minute averaging period. The range of the <b>ceilometer</b> is up to 25000 ft depending on the model. Clouds above that height are not detectable by automated stations at present.|$|E

In the worst recorded <b>ceilometer</b> kill-off, on October 7-8, 1954, 50,000 birds from 53 different species were killed at Warner Robins Air Force Base.|$|E
50|$|For {{cloud base}} {{determination}} purpose, {{due to the}} ceilometer's ability to pick up any {{particle in the air}} (dust, precipitation, smoke, etc.), it will give occasional false readings. As an example, depending on the threshold used, falling diamond dust (ice crystals) may cause the <b>ceilometer</b> to report a cloud height of zero, even though the sky is clear.|$|E
40|$|Urban {{air quality}} {{assessment}} requires {{the knowledge of}} the temporal and spatial structure of the mixing layer, because this structure controls the vertical dilution of near-surface pollutants. The behaviour of the mixing layer is a consequence of vertical temperature and moisture profiles in the lower atmosphere so that remote sensing can be a suitable tool to monitor it. Three <b>ceilometers,</b> a Vaisala LD 40 and two Vaisala CL 31, have been operated for many months in the German city of Augsburg in order to observe the vertical aerosol distribution. Wind and temperature profile information have been obtained for a part of the period from radio-acoustic sounding system (RASS) observations. This paper investigates the abilities of the instruments and compares the information received by the <b>ceilometers</b> among each other and with temperature profiles from the RASS data...|$|R

At Hohenpeissenberg, a number of reactive gases, e. g. sulphuric acid, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides were additionally measured {{during the period of}} interest. Also ozone sondes were launched at Hohenpeissenberg in the pre-alpine area. A newly established network of <b>ceilometers</b> (Jenoptik CHM 15 K) at currently 36 meteorological stations in Germany provided the temporal evolution of emissions over Germany.

50|$|Diamond dust may {{sometimes}} cause {{a problem for}} automated airport weather stations.

50|$|An optical drum <b>ceilometer</b> uses {{triangulation}} {{to determine}} {{the height of a}} spot of light projected onto the base of the cloud. It consists essentially of a rotating projector, a detector, and a recorder. The projector emits an intense beam of light above into the sky at an angle that varies with the rotation. The detector, which is located at a fixed distance from the projector, uses a photodetector pointing vertically. When it detects the projected light return from the cloud base, the instrument notes the angle and the calculation gives the height of clouds.|$|E
50|$|Using {{these last}} properties, ceilometers will have other uses. Since the {{instrument}} will note any returns, {{it is possible}} to locate any faint layer where it occurs, additionally to the cloud's base, by looking at the whole pattern of returned energy. Furthermore, the rate at which diffusion happens can be noted by the diminishing part returned to the <b>ceilometer</b> in clear air, giving the coefficient of extinction of the light signal. Using these data could give the vertical visibility and the possible concentration of air pollutants. This has been developed in research and could be applied for operational purpose.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ground based {{remote sensing}} systems for future {{observation}} operations will allow continuous {{monitoring of the}} lower troposphere at temporal resolutions much better than every 30 min. Observations which may be considered spurious from an individual instrument can be validated or eliminated when considered in conjunction with measure-ments from other instruments observing at the same loca-tion. Thus, improved quality control of atmospheric pro-files from microwave radiometers and wind profilers should be sought by considering the measurements from different systems together rather than individually. In future test bed deployments for future operational observing systems, this should be aided by observations from laser <b>ceilometers</b> and cloud radars.

40|$|During AprileMay 2010 {{volcanic}} ash clouds from the Icelandic Eyjafjallajökull volcano reached Europe causing an unprecedented disruption of the EUR/NAT region airspace. Civil aviation authorities banned all flight operations because of {{the threat posed by}} {{volcanic ash}} to modern turbine aircraft. New quantitative airborne ash mass concentration thresholds, still under discussion, were adopted for discerning regions contaminated by ash. This has implications for ash dispersal models routinely used to forecast the evolution of ash clouds. In this new context, quantitative model validation and assessment of the accuracies of current state-of-the-art models is of paramount importance. The passage of {{volcanic ash clouds}} over central Europe, a territory hosting a dense network of meteorological and air quality observatories, generated a quantity of observations unusual for volcanic clouds. From the ground, the cloud was observed by aerosol lidars, lidar <b>ceilometers,</b> sun photometers, other remote-sensing instruments and in-situ collectors. From the air, sondes and multiple aircraft measurements also took extremely valuable in-situ and remote-sensing measurements. These measurements constitute an excellent database for model validation. Here we validate the FALL 3 D ash dispersal model by comparing model results with ground and airplane-based measurements obtained during the initial 14 e 23 April 2010 Eyjafjallajökull explosive phase. We run the model at high spatial resolution using as input hourlyaveraged observed heights of the eruption column and the total grain size distribution reconstructed from field observations. Model results are then compared against remote ground-based and in-situ aircraft-based measurements, including lidar <b>ceilometers</b> from the German Meteorological Service, aerosol lidars and sun photometers from EARLINET and AERONET networks, and flight missions of the German DLR Falcon aircraft. We find good quantitative agreement, with an error similar to the spread in the observations (however depending on the method used to estimate mass eruption rate) for both airborne and ground mass concentration. Such verification results help us understand and constrain the accuracy and reliability of ash transport models and it is of enormous relevance for designing future operational mitigation strategies at Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers...|$|R
