Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory, sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting. Discovering that the last treatment was successful, Neville tries to assess the situation as the alpha male deliberately rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a <b>coal</b> <b>chute</b> {{in the back of}} the lab. He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers at the cost of his own life, saving the cure. The next day, before dusk, Anna and Ethan discover that her theory is right as they arrive at the survivors camp in Vermont. They are greeted by some military officers and other survivors and Anna is shown handing the cure to a man.|$|E
5|$|The offset boiler {{and coal}} bunker caused the locomotive's {{centre of gravity}} to be shifted to one side. Experiments had to be {{undertaken}} to balance the locomotive by filling the linking corridor with large quantities of scrap metal, replaced in a re-design by a raised floor, covering the weighted material. These modifications resulted in the engine exceeding the total weight limit of 150 tons (151 tonnes), severely limiting the design's route availability during testing. A related problem was that despite being a tall locomotive, at , the cab ceilings were relatively low. The cab at the smokebox end of the locomotive suffered from the same excessive heat as did the fireman's cab. To circumvent this problem the locomotive was used in reverse, as the rear cab was next to the water tank and <b>coal</b> <b>chute</b> and therefore away from the hot gases circulating inside the smokebox.|$|E

50|$|Although Youngstown's {{economic}} {{downturn in the}} 1970s and suburban flight directly impacted the Fosterville neighborhood, it was Idora Park's closing that was the death knell {{for many of the}} South Side businesses. The geographic location of Fosterville positioned the neighborhood to be a grand thoroughfare to the many entrances of Mill Creek Park such as Old Furnace Road. Lake Glacier was a primary getaway spot for generations. The Fosterville neighborhood saw the closing of many long-lived businesses in the 1980s: Parker's Frozen Custard, JB's Lounge, the Crystal Lounge, Mr. Paul's Bakery, Isaly's Dairy, Foster Theater, Sparkle's Supermarket and the Park Inn. Nested in the middle of Fosterville was The Youngstown Playhouse, Chicago Street Athletic Field which saw its heyday with the school-aged baby boom of the 1960s, and the historical Fosterville postal substation. The historical residents of Fosterville maintained what was known as 'land covenants' in an effort to prevent the influx of non-white immigrating citizens from disturbing the neighborhood's planned integrity as had been maintained with the return of World War II veterans who settled in the neighborhood post-1930s. The architecture of the neighborhoods from the 1930s to 1960 is prevalent in the older existing homes - what few remain. Enclosed porches and <b>coal</b> <b>chutes</b> to cellar spaces beneath the homes were prevalent qualities. Rounded Dutch barn-shaped three story homes were commonplace.

25|$|By 1820 the navigations had {{fixed the}} worst of the barging issues, a road from the mines was {{systematically}} being improved easing the teamster's problems and the ventures began to make substantial money; by 1822 the two companies were combined into the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company and both the navigational works and the mule road were re-routed so they reached Mauch Chunk, the mule road high enough to dump <b>coal</b> by <b>chutes</b> into barges on the town's quay. By 1824 the company was flush with cash, had been further improving the lower river with two way locks and seeking other sources, began buying more coal lands and eventually bought lands around Hazleton and Ashley and the saddle shaped mountain pass above at Penobscot, Pennsylvania (now Mountain Top) above both south Wilkes-Barre on the Susquehanna and White Haven on the Lehigh {{at the head of the}} gorge.|$|R
5000|$|The {{opening of}} the line to Slaithwaite {{required}} additional rolling stock, {{and it was this}} that ultimately led to the decision to electrify the whole system. Reports were produced by the Tramways Department, the Electricity Department and by the Borough Engineer, Mr K F Campbell. Campbell suggested building a new power station, car sheds and offices at Longroyd Bridge, and this was accepted by the Corporation. They obtained powers and borrowed £47,780, (...) to modernise and electrify the system in 1900. The main contractors were Greenwood & Batley of Leeds. 25 new tramcars were ordered from G.F. Milnes, who had by this time moved to a new works at Hadley in Shropshire. Each car ran on two four-wheeled bogies, had an open upper deck, and seating for 56 passengers. The downstairs saloon was heated, with crimson velvet cushions and curtains at the windows. The power station was formally opened on 7 February 1901. 150 guests were invited to the event, including the managers of other local tramway systems. The Board of Trade then made an inspection of the tracks, and electric services started running from Huddersfield railway station in St. George's Square to Outlane and Lindley both via Marsh and Edgerton on 14 February 1901. The first phase included the conversion of five routes, and these were completed by the end of February. A second phase was completed between February and July 1902, {{when the rest of the}} lines were converted. This phase included an extension to Honley of the existing tracks to Berry Brow. Honley was the first place served which was outside the Borough of Huddersfield. A further 36 tramcars were ordered from the British Electric Car Co of Trafford Park, Manchester. These were of two designs, seating 51 and 55 passengers. They had an open-topped upper deck and ran on a 4-wheeled truck. They were better suited to the steeply graded routes than the larger bogie cars. In 1903, nine more tramcars were purchased, bringing the total to 70 cars. Roofs began to be fitted to the upper decks from November 1902. When the system was converted to electric traction, the gauge was retained, as the Corporation still hoped to use the steam tram locomotives to haul coal wagons around the system. In anticipation of such a service, a branch was built from the Outlane route to Wellington Mills, owned by Martin Sons & Co. The branch reached 1245 ft above sea level near the mills. Negotiations to allow a connection from the Bradford Road route to the <b>coal</b> <b>chutes</b> at Hillhouse Sidings took rather longer, but after three years of negotiation, the London and North Western and Lancashire and Yorkshire Joint Railway finally agreed, and the connection was made. Two electric coal trams were built, each with Westinghouse motors and Westinghouse-Newall magnetic track brakes. They could carry 10 tons of coal, and were first demonstrated on 2 September 1904. Subsequently, Gosport Mill and Lindley Mill, both on the Outlane route, also took delivery of coal by the tramway. Each year around 12,000 tons of coal were delivered, and the cars covered some 9000 mi.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coal</b> {{trestles}} or <b>chutes</b> {{were built}} for the New York Central's locomotives at Lyons, and in August 1879, 1000 ST of coal per day were shipped over the Geneva and Lyons to the trestles there. About 400 ST were used to fuel locomotives at Lyons and the remainder shipped elsewhere on the New York Central system. By 1886, this amount had increased to 230000 ST in a month, both bituminous coal from the Fall Brook's mines and anthracite from connections southward. At the time, {{it was reported that}} the Lehigh Valley Railroad, was also running over the Geneva and Lyons to deliver coal. In January 1887, the coal shipments had increased again, to 22000 ST daily. In August 1881, work began to double-track the line. By April 1882, the double track had been finished from Geneva to Bennett's and from Lyons to Thompson's. However, the complete double-tracking was still unfinished in 1893. 12.67 mi of the line, which totaled 14.08 mi, had been double-tracked as of 1914.|$|R
50|$|The coal tipping cranes, (referred to as coal-tips, hoists or staiths by the Barry Railway Co) were {{elevated}} {{well above}} water level. After being weighed, a loaded wagon, which would hold about 10 LT of coal, was {{pulled from the}} weighbridge, onto a raisable or lowerable cradle at the hoist to suit the <b>coal</b> <b>chute</b> and a vessels open hold.The cradle was held within a tower, and usually had a downhill gradient railtrack of 1 in 233 towards the weighbridge but a 1 in 70 downhill incline out.The cradle could also be raised or lowered as the dock water level varied.Using hydraulic power, the cradle was tilted to an angle, so the coal {{ran out of the}} wagon and down a <b>coal</b> <b>chute</b> into the hold of the vessel below.At the start of loading, the coal would run into a suspended anti-breakage box, which was hydraulically lowered into the hold and emptied through a hinged flap at the bottom.As loading proceeded, a cone of coal built up below the anti-breakage box until it reached the height {{of the end of the}} chute.At this stage the anti-breakage box was swung out of the way and the coal allowed to run directly down the chute and down the sides of the cone at its angle of repose.Coal trimmers in the hold would level the coal.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1935. It {{opened with a}} passimeter for quick sale of tickets and in the off peak {{collection}} of tickets from one side and sale from the other. A ticket collectors position was provided with stable door, now a bin store. A ticket office was also provided to deal with parcels and also had the electrical fuses and switches. Now a shop, switch room, and computer room. The station had central heating supplied by a coal boiler under the booking hall, a <b>coal</b> <b>chute</b> from a street manhole was used to supply coal. The boiler was later converted to gas, all removed when the new ticket office was built opposite for the Underground ticket system.|$|E
50|$|Utilities are {{literally}} centralised {{for all four}} units, reducing piping. The floorplan could utilize only electric, oil or gas heat: No <b>coal</b> <b>chute</b> or bin is shown. However, coal heat was common at the time. With minor design changes, including a fuel bin and chute, the heater below the carport permits a vendor to deliver solid fuels by gravity. The basement heater room is below habitable areas, separated from them by masonry walls and two floors, reducing fire risks. The basement is also suitable for a storm shelter. Its walls are bearing walls, it is below grade, and the stair leading to it opens to a barrier wall, protecting the basement entrance from wind-borne projectiles.|$|E
50|$|The Brighton General Gas Light Company {{was formed}} in 1825. Although {{production}} of coal gas was notorious for the smell it produced, the company acquired land in the fields between Hove Street and St. Andrew's Church, and in 1832 built a gasworks on a two-acre site. The process required substantial tonnage of coal, delivered by horse-drawn cart on the unmade tracks in the vicinity, and removal of by-products including coke, coal tar, sulphur and ammonia. An industrial site such as this, with a tall chimney and two gasometers next to the churchyard was a considerable intrusion on the populace of Hove, but not for still-distant and rapidly growing Brighton, the main centre of consumption. Being situated in Hove it avoided the duty of £1 per 8 tons levied on coal by the Brighton Town Act of 1773. A gasworks built east of Brighton in 1819, and therefore similarly exempt, was supplied by sailing brigs grounding at high tide, the crew tipping the <b>coal</b> down <b>chutes</b> into horse-drawn carts then re-floating on the next tide. This method, inherently dirty and disruptive, would have been used at Hove until {{the arrival of the}} railway in 1840. By 1861 the site had doubled in size and there were now five gasometers, ranging in size from small to large. Due to spiralling demand a large new works was opened in Shoreham Harbour at Portslade-by-Sea in 1871, and by 1885 all gas manufacture in Brighton and Hove had been transferred there. The Hove site, in a by now primarily residential area, was then used for storage only.|$|R
40|$|Air {{pollutants}} {{are added}} {{into the atmosphere}} from variety of sources that change {{the composition of the}} atmosphere and affect the biotic environment. Because of the presence of high amount of air pollutants in the ambient air, the health of the population and property is getting adversely affected. In Mettur thermal power station (MTPS) primary fuel is coal. The requirement of coal per day 14000 tons. The coal transported through railway wagons has been unloaded in wagon Tripler. From the wagon Tripler During the coal unloading activity, enormous coal has been extracted from the <b>coal</b> transfer <b>chute,</b> which in turn polluted the entire coal handling area. Hence, to tide over the problem, it is necessary to go for effective coal control measures in MTPS. In pulse jet bag filter, the coal that is disc lodged from a row of bags may be picked up by the adjacent row of bags as the latter is under suction. The coal may remain is suspended condition- especially if it is light and / or fine- the reverse upward gas flow not allowing the coal to settle in the hopper. This phenomenon is called fluidization of coal. The coal particles are sucked from the suction point and allowed to the bag filter. The air from the suction point is made to fall on the baffle plate and then it is allowed to the bags. This air goes {{to the bottom of the}} bag, then it comes out on the top of the bag there all the coal particles are collected on the outer surface of the bag. Then the cleaned air is sent out through the chimney...|$|R
5000|$|However, Lehigh Gorge and its rapid waters {{stood in}} the way as barges could not pass the rapids. This relegated to {{shipping}} coal by slow mule train, which is labor-intensive and costly, as it is pragmatically limited to an eighth ton per mule. After 1818 fuel shortages were growing acute, and the partially barged and partial mule-trained coal deliveries by the Lehigh Coal Mining Company were unpredictable and sporadic. This problem was solved by Josiah White who leased the operating rights and also formed the Lehigh Navigation Company and began to systematically put into place the original series of dams and locks and channel improvements of the navigation from Easton on the Delaware the 40 miles up to the Mauch Chunk Creek, outletting in area of todays Lehighton, which streamside trail was the easiest decent for the mule trains to reach the river about twelve miles from the Summit Hill and Lansford mines.By 1820 the navigations had fixed the worst of the barging issues, a road from the mines was systematically being improved easing the teamsters problems and the ventures began to make substantial money; by 1822 the two companies were combined into the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company and both the navigational works and the mule road were re-routed so they reached Mauch Chunk, the mule road high enough to dump <b>coal</b> by <b>chutes</b> into barges on the towns quay.

500|$|A 20th-century {{modification}} of the compartment boat system was used to feed the coal-fired Ferrybridge [...] "C" [...] power station. Starting in 1967, Cawoods Hargreaves used trains of three tubs or coal pans, which were rigidly connected, and pushed by a tug when loaded. The trains were filled with <b>coal</b> using canalside <b>chutes</b> at the colliery and pushed to the power station, where a hoist lifted each pan from the canal and upturned it to drop its contents onto a conveyor belt. Nine tugs and 35 pans were employed, with each pan holding around 170 tonnes. By the time the final load left Astley colliery in December 2002, 43 million tonnes had been delivered to Ferrybridge in this way. Experiments were made with trains of four pans, which allowed copper pipes to be carried {{on top of the}} coal for delivery to Goole, but this was short-lived. Coal carrying came to an abrupt halt in 2003 when the St Aidan's opencast mine was exhausted and the coal from Kellingley colliery was found to have levels of sulphur content high above the acceptable limit. During 2008, three of the trains were used on the River Don, to transport 250,000 tonnes of limestone from a quarry at Cadeby to Hexthorpe.|$|R
