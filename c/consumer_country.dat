25|$|Benzene is used {{mainly as}} an {{intermediate}} to make other chemicals, above all ethylbenzene, cumene, cyclohexane, nitrobenzene, and alkylbenzene. More {{than half of the}} entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene, a precursor to styrene, which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene and EPS. Some 20% of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene, which is needed to produce phenol and acetone for resins and adhesives. Cyclohexane consumes ca. 10% of the world's benzene production; it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers, which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics. Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, explosives, and pesticides. In 2013, the biggest <b>consumer</b> <b>country</b> of benzene was China, followed by the USA.

The public good in question is reduced emissions of greenhouse gases, which limits the public bad of climate change. Emissions can be reduced both through demand- and supply-side policies, and countries differ in which type of policy they prefer. Two stylized models are developed, with <b>consumer</b> <b>countries</b> that consume fossil fuels, but produce none, and producer countries that produce fossil fuels, but consume none. In the first model, a producer country that does not care about the climate interacts with <b>consumer</b> <b>countries</b> that do.

In the second model, both producer and <b>consumer</b> <b>countries</b> care about the cli- mate. It is shown that the nature of future climate policies matters for emissions today. Between countries that prefer the same type of climate policy, the dynamic public good problem is aggravated.

The earlier agreements tended to be somewhat informal and sporadic {{and led to the}} [...] "First International Tin Agreement" [...] in 1956, the first of a continuously numbered series that effectively collapsed in 1985. Through this series of agreements, the International Tin Council (ITC) had a considerable effect on tin prices. The ITC supported the price of tin during periods of low prices by buying tin for its buffer stockpile and was able to restrain the price during periods of high prices by selling tin from the stockpile. This was an anti-free-market approach, designed to assure a sufficient flow of tin to <b>consumer</b> <b>countries</b> and a profit for producer countries. However, the buffer stockpile was not sufficiently large, and during most of those 29 years tin prices rose, sometimes sharply, especially from 1973 through 1980 when rampant inflation plagued many world economies.|$|R

40|$|Does recent {{growth of}} darknet markets signify a slow {{reorganisation}} of the illicit drug trade? Where are darknet markets {{situated in the}} global drug supply chain? In principle, these platforms allow producers to sell directly to end users, bypassing traditional trafficking routes.

In a large-scale empirical study, we determine the darknet trading geography of three plant-based drugs across four of the largest darknet markets, and compare it to the global footprint of production and consumption for these drugs. We present strong evidence that cannabis and cocaine vendors are primarily located in a small number of <b>consumer</b> <b>countries,</b> rather than producer countries, suggesting that darknet trading happens at the 'last mile', possibly leaving old trafficking routes intact. A model to explain trading volumes of opiates is inconclusive. We cannot find evidence for significant production-side offerings across any of the drug types or marketplaces.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the {{economic}} situation changed. Governments and farmers alike were under increasing pressure from NGOs and the <b>consumer</b> <b>countries,</b> who criticized the practices of the trade. International trade conflicts erupted, such as import bans by <b>consumer</b> <b>countries</b> on shrimp containing antibiotics, the United States' shrimp import ban against Thailand in 2004 as a measure against Thai shrimp fishers not using turtle excluder devices in their nets, or the [...] "anti-dumping" [...] case initiated by U.S. shrimp fishers in 2002 against shrimp farmers worldwide, which resulted two years later in the U.S. imposing antidumping tariffs {{of the order of}} about 10% against many producer countries (except China, which received a 112% duty). Diseases caused significant economic losses. In Ecuador, where shrimp farming was a major export sector (the other two are bananas and oil), the whitespot outbreak of 1999 caused an estimated 130,000 workers to lose their jobs. Furthermore, shrimp prices dropped sharply in 2000. All of these factors contributed to the slowly growing acceptance by farmers that improved farming practices were needed, and resulted in tighter government regulation of the business, both of which internalized some of the external costs that were ignored during the boom years.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyThe {{services}} sector has grown significantly {{in most countries}} {{and in the world}} economy as a whole. This has been observed in the progression from primary to secondary and/or tertiary sector-led economic growth and development. Services contribute significantly to output, employment and exports. They account for about 80 % of the United States output (GDP) and about 65 % of GDP of the European Union. Developed countries are the largest service exporters accounting for over 70 % of services traded in the late 1990 s. Although developing countries account for a relatively small proportion of internationally traded services their exports of services grew more significantly than those of developed countries during the 1990 s. Travel and tourism are the most significant service exports of developing countries. Export of financial services became increasingly significant since the 1990 s. Most Caribbean countries have moved directly from primary-sector-led development to tertiary-sector-led development. Despite this, data collection and accounting methods remained largely biased towards measurement of the goods producing sectors of the economy. This is no doubt {{due to the fact that}} the output of {{services sector}}s is more difficult to measure than that of goods sectors. Part of the problem of measurement has to do with the treatment of services within goods producing sectors. One can determine the contribution of services to output if, for example, a firm manufacturing beverages purchases accounting and transport services from external producers of those services. If, however, the firm in question produces the services in house then those services would be included as manufacturing output. Since services constitute a significant part of production, the total output of services is therefore likely to be underestimated. The contribution of the services sector to growth could therefore be much larger than is officially recorded. Separating the services component from the manufacturing component would help in determining the factors that contribute to the competitiveness of particular industries and products. It would also help in determining the real value of services exports from Caribbean countries. In order to effectively measure or assess the contribution of services to economic growth and development it is useful to know what constitutes a service. A service can be defined as an economic activity that produces a good or product that is intangible or invisible. It can be either a final product or an input into another economic activity. It is therefore best understood in terms of its characteristics. A service, unlike a good, cannot be seen and it has to be consumed at the same time that it is being provided. Services therefore cannot be stockpiled like goods. Economists consider most services non-tradable because they have to be consumed where they are produced and therefore lack mobility. However, technological development and the process of trade liberalisation that has intensified since the 1990 s, especially since the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), have facilitated international trade in most services. Nevertheless, the mode of delivery determines the tradability of services. If trade in services is defined only in terms of cross-border supply, that is from supplier country to <b>consumer</b> <b>country,</b> then most services would still be considered non-tradable. In addition to cross-border supply, services can be traded through the movement of the consumer to the supplier country (tourism); through the establishment by the service provider of a firm in the <b>consumer</b> <b>country</b> (bank branch); and through the movement of individual providers (persons) to the <b>consumer</b> <b>country.</b> Trade in services therefore depends on two critical features of economic integration - the movement of capital and the movement of labour. The pace of liberalisation of these movements will determine the growth of international trade in services...|$|E

40|$|Certain trends {{stand out}} in this survey of Western European and North American gas markets and Japanese-Asian, Middle Eastern-African, and Latin American gas trades. Prices for natural gas are usually locally based -depending on the costs of exploration, {{development}} and transmission, and prevailing gas prices locally. The price in most international contracts is changed periodically, however, based on an escalator or price adjustment clause linked to prices for crude oil or oil products in the <b>consumer</b> <b>country.</b> As for global trends in gas trades, new pricing terms and contractual arrangements that emerge in one country may soon be copied in others. With a take or pay provision, a purchaser must pay for a contracted volume of gas even if it cannot take the gas. Under a common carrier arrangement, a pipeline company provides transportation only, without buying and reselling the gas in its own name or discriminating among buyers and sellers. The common carrier concept has already taken hold in the United States. It is now becoming an issue in Europe, where the gas monopolies have always rebuffed it.

Their aim was to stabilize prices around a figure negotiated between producer and <b>consumer</b> <b>countries</b> and each agreement had a structure written into it which would allow it to function successfully. For coffee this was a quota system. Each year the International Coffee Organization (ICO), which was charged with the administration of the agreement, assessed world demand. Dependent on this, each exporting country was given an export quota (in coffee tonnage) which it promised to respect. As a result some sort of balance between supply and demand was achieved. Cocoa operated a buffer stock system. When prices reached their floor (a figure negotiated between producers and consumers), the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), whose job it was to manage the agreement, bought cocoa on the international market, until supply was short and prices rose again. Conversely, when prices went higher than a pre-agreed figure, ICCO released cocoa from its stocks back onto the market.
