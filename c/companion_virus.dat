40|$|Two human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) variants derived from a single parental isolate were found to differ substantially {{in their ability to}} replicate in CD 4 -positive cells. Using transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression assays, we show that the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the better-replicating virus has significantly higher capacity than that of the <b>companion</b> <b>virus</b> to direct gene expression in T cells. Sequence data and site-specific mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that the higher LTR activity of the better-replicating HIV- 1 is due to a combined effect of two mutations: (i) a point mutation in position - 94 (relative to the transcriptional start site), which is located between the two subunits of the HIV- 1 enhancer, and (ii) a duplication of 24 base pairs in positions - 128 to - 151, which was not previously known to be involved in any regulatory function. The presence of these mutations increases the basal level of the LTR-driven gene expression and does not influence the degree of induction caused by the viral tat gene product or by cell activation. Reciprocal exchange of LTRs between the respective viral DNAs results in a change of a recombinant virus replication pattern consistent with the activity of the particular LTR. These experiments suggest that the HIV- 1 LTR is one of the sites which determines the functional heterogeneity of HIV- 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the recent {{incident}} involving the DownAdUp (better known as Conficker) malware detection, and to provide recommendations to GIAC on further detection, remediation and prevention measures that may be required. The conclusion we reached is that the recent event probably involved a Conficker infection, but not at GIAC. It was most likely a spam email sent from the <b>companion</b> <b>virus</b> Waledac, which “piggybacks ” on Conficker. C and newer variants. The initial email probably originated from outside of GIAC, and was simply masquerading as a email from the GIAC CIO. We would need the email server logs from the target organization to comment any further on this. However, the exploration into the incident has brought to light several related issues at GIAC that should be dealt with. The concern for the Conficker virus should be extended to the thousands of other malware packages that are created each day, and some basic changes to our IT infrastructure and team should be considered. These are separated into recommendations of low or no cost, and recommendations that should be considered for next years budget. First, let’s consider the low/no cost recommendations:! We should be devoting significant resources to a Security Awareness program within our user community. While it is not an easy task, the costs are relatively low, and thi...|$|E

50|$|Braxton became {{active in}} politics, and in May 1872, {{he was elected}} county constable. Later that year a warrant was written for a local doctor named William Virus. Virus was notorious and {{had been accused of}} murder but never tried. When Braxton and two other men went to Virus' farm, Virus refused to {{cooperate}} and threatened to kill Braxton. Braxton and his <b>companions</b> subdued <b>Virus,</b> but when Virus was received by the court, he accused Braxton of assault and battery. The court would not take Braxton's accusation that Virus resisted arrest and threatened to kill an officer of the law in the discharge of duty. As Braxton was black and Virus white, Braxton concluded that this was because of prejudice and resigned from his position.|$|R

2500|$|AIDS II is a <b>companion</b> {{computer}} <b>virus,</b> which infects COM files. It {{was first}} discovered in April 1990, {{and is a}} variant of AIDS. Unlike other generic file infectors, AIDS II was the second known virus to employ {{what could be called}} a [...] "corresponding file technique" [...] of infection so that the original target EXE file is never changed.(The original AIDS was the first.) The virus takes advantage of the DOS feature where if a file exists in both COM and EXE form, the COM file is executed. When an [...] "infected" [...] file is executed, since a corresponding COM file exists, the COM file containing the viral code is executed. The virus first locates an uninfected EXE file in the current directory and creates a corresponding (or companion) COM file with the viral code. These COM files will always be 8,064 bytes in length with a file date/time of the date/time of infection. After creating the new COM file, the virus then plays a loud chiptune note, and displays the following message: ...|$|R
40|$|Phloem {{transport}} of plant viruses {{is an essential}} step in the setting-up of a complete infection of a host plant. After an initial replication step in the first cells, viruses spread from cell-to-cell through mesophyll cells, until they reach the vasculature where they rapidly move to distant sites {{in order to establish}} the infection of the whole plant. This last step is referred to as systemic transport, or long-distance movement, and involves virus crossings through several cellular barriers: bundle sheath, vascular parenchyma and <b>companion</b> cells for <b>virus</b> loading into sieve elements. Viruses are then passively transported within the source-to-sink flow of photoassimilates and are unloaded from sieve elements into sink tissues. However, the molecular mechanisms governing virus long-distance movement are far from being understood. While most viruses seem to move systemically as virus particles, some viruses are transported in sieve elements as viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP). The nature of the cellular and viral factors constituting these RNPs is still poorly known. The topic of this review will mainly focus on the host and viral factors that facilitate or restrict virus long-distance movement...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{the essential}} component of antiviral immunity in invertebrates and plants. One of the landmarks of the antiviral RNAi response is the production of virus-derived small interfering RNA (vsiRNA) from viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). vsiRNAs constitute a fragmented image of the viral genome sequence that results from Dicer cleavage. vsiRNA sequence profiling is used extensively as a surrogate to study the antiviral RNAi response by determining {{the nature of the}} viral dsRNA molecules exposed to and processed by the RNAi machinery. The accuracy of these profiles depends on the actual viral genome sequence used as a reference to align vsiRNA reads, and the interpretation of inaccurate profiles can be misleading. Using Flock house virus and Drosophila melanogaster as a model RNAi-competent organism, we show accurate reconstruction of full-length virus reference sequence from vsiRNAs and prediction of the structure of defective interfering particles (DIs). We developed a Perl script, named Paparazzi, that reconstitutes viral genomes through an iterative alignment/consensus call procedure using a related reference sequence as scaffold. As prevalent DI-derived reads introduce artifacts during reconstruction, Paparazzi eliminates DI-specific reads {{to improve the quality of}} the reconstructed genome. Paparazzi constitutes a promising alternative to Sanger sequencing in this context and an effective tool to study antiviral RNAi mechanisms by accurately quantifying vsiRNA along the replicating viral genome. We further discuss Paparazzi as a <b>companion</b> tool for <b>virus</b> discovery as it provides full-length genome sequences and corrects for potential artifacts of assembly...|$|R
