[...] Kanae, Hakutei, and a former art-school classmate of Kanae's, , founded the monthly magazine Hōsun. whose first issue appeared 15 May 1907. [...] It was patterned on such European magazines as Cocorico, Jugend, Simplicissimus. [...] The contents were primarily literature, criticism, and art cartoons, and its publishers paid fine attention to details of graphic design. [...] They printed the magazine on fine paper at an unusually large size and mixed <b>colour</b> <b>reproduction</b> with black-and-white. [...] Kanae's contributions included his own prints, haiku poetry, and the carving of printing blocks for the designs of others. [...] Kanae's former engraving teacher Sakurai Torakichi furnished the photographic printing plates. [...] The first issue was eight pages and included a supplementary print of Shiba Park by Kanae. [...] The young artists distributed the issue themselves to bookstores. [...] It sold well, and the circle of contributors grew, as did the page count, which expanded to sixteen.|$|E

It measures just 0.05mm (thinner than paper), yet a Samsung staff member said that it is [...] "technically possible to make the panel thinner". To achieve this thickness, Samsung etched an OLED panel that uses a normal glass substrate. The drive circuit was formed by low-temperature polysilicon TFTs. Also, low-molecular organic EL materials were employed. The pixel count of the display is 480 × 272. The contrast ratio is 100,000:1, and the luminance is 200cd/m2. The <b>colour</b> <b>reproduction</b> range is 100% of the NTSC standard.|$|E
