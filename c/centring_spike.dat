40|$|Background: Up to 2007 {{there was}} no formal {{external}} quality assurance programme for plasma free metanephrines. A pilot programme was conceived by the AACB (Australian Association of Clinical Biochemists) Working Party on biogenic amines. With support from the AACB and Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance programmes, a pilot study was developed. Data from this study are presented for the first time. Methods: Twelve lyophilized plasma samples were distributed to 15 <b>centres.</b> Samples were <b>spiked</b> with metanephrine (metadrenaline), normetanephrine (normetadrenaline) and 3 -methoxytyramine, all derived from human urine. Concentrations were arranged in a linear relationship. The analytes were present at six levels and samples were duplicated. Results: High-pressure liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry methods showed acceptable precision but in general enzyme immunoassay displayed {{a higher degree of}} imprecision as well as a negative bias. Conclusions: Differences in calibration and matrix effects are likely to have been responsible for the discrepancy between chromatographic and immunoassay methods. These differences need to be further examined although efforts at standardization between different methods have been hampered by the lack of a universal calibrator for plasma metanephrines. Meanwhile, a laboratory’s performance characteristics can be monitored and enhanced by participation in suitable external quality assurance programmes...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Peckham was a centre of {{underground}} music {{partly due to}} a large squat known as The Dolehouse in a disused, 2 floor DHSS building near Peckham High Street. The building was already known for having featured in the cover shot of a 1980s pictorial biography of 1960s' mods, featuring them on their customised scooters outside the then Camberwell Labour Exchange. In 1989 the squatters adopted the name Dole House Crew and along with another local group of squatters called the [...] "Green Circus", held regular gigs/parties in the building. Upstairs was a large live gig room and downstairs was a rave DJ set up. There were also two bars, a vegan cafe and a chill out lounge. During the week, any empty rooms were utilised for bands or artists. Those involved provided music at various free festivals in the 1990s and also assistance to the then budding Deptford urban free festival (later the Fordham Park urban free festival). They moved on to many other South East London venues after the Peckham Dolehouse was evicted in late October 1990. A squatted social <b>centre</b> called the <b>Spike</b> Surplus Scheme ran from 1998 until being evicted by the council in 2009.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{the study}} was to examine age {{differences}} in the maximal power and height of rise of the body mass <b>centre</b> measured in <b>spike</b> jump (SPJ) and counter-movement jump (CMJ), and power-velocity relationship of lower extremities between cadet and U 23 age class judo athletes. Methods. Seven cadets (age 16. 6 ± 0. 7 years) and eight U 23 age class (21. 3 ± 1. 4 years) Polish judoists took part in the study. The maximal power and height of jump were measured at SPJ and CMJ jumps. Power- velocity relations (P-v) were determined from 5 maximal cycle ergometer exercise bouts at increasing external loads equal to 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0 and 12. 5 % of body weight (BW). Results. Cadet judoists had a significantly smaller maximal power output (11. 56 ± 1. 21 W ・ kg- 1) than U 23 athletes (12. 69 ± 0. 67 W ・ kg- 1). The optimal velocity was similar in both group (119. 3 ± 16. 0 rpm and 119. 6 ± 15. 5 rpm, respectively). Significant age differences were founded between the cadet and U 23 athletes for power output at external load equal 12. 5 % BW. Cadet judoists generated insignificantly lower maximal power in CMJ and SPJ than U 23 judo athletes with except of the absolute maximal power in SPJ. The age difference was observed in height of CMJ. Conclusions. Based on the characteristics of F-v curve we can see in which direction follow the effects of training. Application of CMJ and SPJ in jumping test allows to assess changes in neuromuscular coordination. The use of the both methods give better information to optimal training control...|$|R
40|$|Greaves, G. N., Wilding, M. C., Hennet, L., Langstaff, D., Kargl, F., Benmore, C. J., Weber, J. K. R. (2011). Comment on ?Liquid-liquid phase {{transition}} in supercooled yttria-alumina?. Phys. Rev. Lett., 106 (11). PACS numbers: 64. 70. Ja. 61. 05. cp. 61. 10. Nz. 61. 72. Qq. We welcome efforts made by Barnes et al to study liquid-liquid transitions (LLT) in supercooled Y 2 O 3 x-Al 2 O 3 (100 -x) or AYx melts {{reported in a}} recent Letter [1]. The first order LLT in AY 20, which we have identified in situ under equilibrium conditions [2, 3] has a well-defined temperature TLL at ambient pressure and a critical point at negative pressure. The LLT is also composition dependent, rising as x falls [3, 4]. We identified this at 1788 K from (1) a peak in the small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) intensity, (2) a discontinuity in the structure factor S(Q), and (3) a polyamorphic rotor caused by periodic LLTs (Figure 1 A) the flipping time and associated temperature spikes yielding the LLT density and entropy discontinuities in agreement with ex situ experiments [4]. Barnes et al used similar experiments but could not reproduce (1) or (2) in AY 20 at 1788 K and attributed (3) to 60 K instabilities sometimes encountered during sample conditioning [1]. We consider their null results for AY 20 are due to (A) large neutron beam sizes in small angle neutron scattering (SANS), and (B) doubts in AYx composition. Moreover comparison with our work [2] is obscured in [1] by reliance on apparent temperatures uncorrected for emissivity [5] and by inconsistent molar normalisation leading to flaws in modelling LLTs from our data [3]. (A) In their SANS measurements [1] the mm radius droplet was overspilled by a 2 mm radius 4. 5 beam. Because of the spherical liquid surface this results in total external reflection and cross fire contamination up to at least 2 x 0. 013 = 0. 026 1. Sub mm focussed SAXS has none of these disadvantages [3] {{which is why it}} is sensitive to the rise and fall in scatter that occurs below 0. 03 [2] at the LLT (Figure 1). Importantly polyamorphic rotor action was recorded by L. Hennet during the SANS experiments with periodic 150 K <b>spikes</b> <b>centred</b> at 1940 K (Figure 1 B). Polyamorphic rotors have large repetitive spikes thermally distinct from the oscillations illustrated in [1] which sometimes occur when molten drops contain inclusions. (B) The sample preparation method of fusing 85 mg drops from weight-matched beads of separate oxides [6] is unreliable without validation of recovered samples. We fused mm radius drops by weighing material from 5 g powdered batches following repeated sintering and regrinding. Composition checks post experiment confirm x<mol 1 % accuracy. S(Q) s of AYx melts at 2300 K are composition sensitive (Figure 1). Measurements at 11 -ID-C (APS) [2] and at ID 11 (ESRF) [7] are in good agreement, with the positions of the first and second peaks Q 1 and Q 2, and size of the principal peak S(Q 1) all scaling almost linearly with x, except for values fitted from the peak maxima at 2300 K from [1] FIG 1. Rather than AY 20 these triangulate with the composition. We already investigated AY 15 until crystallisation intervened at 1927 K [2] close to the rotor temperature shown in Figure 1 B. If 1940 K marks the LLT for AY 15 then, with our observation of 1788 K for AY 20 [2], these results further demonstrate that for AYx liquids TLL rises as x falls [3, 4], and provide scope for future collaboration. preprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
