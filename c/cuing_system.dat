40|$|Purpose: The {{adoption}} of functional MRI for presurgical planning in neuro-oncology {{has been limited}} by {{the high degree of}} patient compliance required to generate accurate activation maps. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the brain activation properties and patient head motion associated with a presurgical fMRI <b>cueing</b> <b>system</b> utilizing complex scene and auditory commands to enhance compliance in patients with cognitive and physical deficits. Materials and Methods: An fMRI <b>cueing</b> <b>system</b> which delivered simultaneous audio and video task instructions was compared to a simple visual <b>cueing</b> <b>system</b> across 10 healthy volunteers, each performing two different motor tasks (40 total fMRI acquisitions). Statistical differences between the complex and simple <b>cueing</b> <b>systems</b> were evaluated using a mixed effects modeling method which was able to carry up variances from the individual analyses to the group analysis. Differences in relative head motion between the systems were evaluated using a paired t-test. Results: Both <b>cueing</b> <b>systems</b> demonstrated typical somatotopic activity distributions in the pre- and postcentral gyrus of the left hemisphere. No {{significant differences were found between}} the systems in target brain regions. Furthermore, relative head motion using the complex system was found to not differ statistically from the simple method. Conclusion: The fMRI <b>cueing</b> <b>system</b> using complex scene stimuli produced results comparable to a simple <b>cueing</b> <b>system</b> in target regions of the brain. In patients presenting with deficits that lead to noncompliance with fMRI procedures, the use of complex scene stimuli may provide a good alternative to conventional cueing methods...|$|R

They must be able to relate the newly learned word to prior knowledge through personal associations with text and the structure of text.|$|E
50|$|Infrared seekers are passive devices, which, unlike radar, {{provide no}} {{indication}} that they are tracking a target. This makes them suitable for sneak attacks during visual encounters, or over longer ranges when used with a forward looking infrared system or similar <b>cuing</b> <b>system.</b> This makes heat-seekers extremely deadly; 90% of all United States air combat losses over the past 25 years {{have been due to}} infrared-homing missiles. They are, however, subject to a number of simple countermeasures, most notably dropping flares behind the target to provide false heat sources. This only works if the pilot is aware of the missile and deploys the countermeasures, and modern seekers have rendered these increasingly ineffective even in that case.|$|E

5000|$|The {{semantic}} {{system is}} {{developed from the}} beginning through early interactions with adults. At first, this usually involves labeling (e.g. This is a dog). Then labeling becomes more detailed (e.g., It is a Labrador dog. Its coat is black.) The child learns {{that there is a}} set of [...] "dog attributes" [...] and that within the category [...] "dog", there are subsets of [...] "dog" [...] (e.g. long-hair, short-hair). The development of this system and the development of the important concepts that relate to the system are largely accomplished as children begin to explore language independently. As children speak about what they’ve done and play out their experiences, they are making personal associations between their experiences and language. This is critical to success in later literacy practices such as reading comprehension and writing. The meaning people bring to the reading is available to them through every <b>cuing</b> <b>system,</b> but it’s particularly influential as we move from our sense of the syntactic patterns to the semantic structures.|$|E

In 2002 we published a pilot study suggesting that a subliminal visual <b>cuing</b> <b>system</b> might be an effective low-attention interaction strategy for just-in-time memory support. In this paper we present the results of a larger study demonstrating that not only is wearable subliminal cuing significantly effective (increasing performance by a factor of approximately 1. 5, p = 0. 02), but even incorrect sublim-inal cues can actually improve performance.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{aimed to}} {{elucidate}} how our domain-general cuing algorithm improved multitasking performance and changed behavioral strategies in human operators. BACKGROUND: Though many gaze-control {{systems have been}} designed, previous real-time gaze-aware assistance systems were not both successful and domain general. It is largely unknown what constitutes optimal search efficiency using the eyes, or ideal control using the mouse. It is unclear what the best coordinating strategies are between these two modalities. Our previously developed closed-loop multitasking aid drastically improved multitasking performance, though the behavioral mechanisms through which it acted were unknown. METHODS: We performed in-depth analyses and generated novel eye tracking and mouse movement measures, to explore the complex effects of our helpful system on gaze and motor behavior. RESULTS: Our overlay cuing algorithm improved control efficiency and reduced well-known biases in search patterns. This system also reduced micromanaging behavior, with humans rationally relying more on imperfect automation in experimental assistance cue conditions. We showed that mouse and gaze were more independently specialized in the helpful cuing condition than in control conditions. Specifically, with our aid, the gaze performed more global movement, and the mouse performed more local clustered movement. Further, the gaze shifted towards search over processing with the helpful <b>cuing</b> <b>system.</b> We also illustrated {{a relationship between the}} mouse and the gaze, such that in these studies, the hand was quicker than the eye. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results suggested that our <b>cuing</b> <b>system</b> improved performance and reduced short term working memory load on humans by delegating it to the computer in real time. Further, it reduced the number of required repeated decisions by an estimate of about one per second. It also enabled the gaze to specialize for improved visual search behavior, and the mouse to specialize for improved control...|$|E

To transition this control law to manned systems, it is employed within a cockpit display to drive visual markers which indicate desired collective pitch and longitudinal cyclic positions throughout the entire maneuver, from autorotation entry to touchdown. A series of simulator flight experiments performed at University of Liverpool’s HELIFLIGHT-R simulator are documented, in which pilots attempt autorotation with and without the pilot <b>cueing</b> <b>system</b> in both good and degraded visual environments.

40|$|Master of Arts in Psychology, Human Factors and Applied Psychology Objective: Conduct an {{experimental}} {{study to determine}} the effectiveness of using Descriptive Waypoints (DWs) (a target/checkpoint in space along the flight path that gives the pilot altitude and indicated airspeed) to improve flight performance during Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) procedures, and provide recommendations on DW design and integration into existing CDA procedures. Background: Aircraft noise is a burden on people living around airports and is an impediment {{to the growth of}} air transportation. CDA is an approach that reduces noise impact on the ground by keeping the aircraft at a higher altitude longer than standard approaches and by keeping engines idle or near idle. However, CDA implementation requires controllers to add large separation buffers between aircraft because aircraft of different sizes and weights descend at different rates, consequently creating uncertainty in separation between aircraft. A possible solution to allow aircraft to descend more consistently is to use DWs to provide pilots targets and feedback along the CDA path. Method: Twelve Instrument rated commercial pilots participated in a 3 by 3 Within Subject Factorial Design. Participants flew three different wind conditions using one, three, or five number of DWs. Dependent variables included: deviation from target DW altitude and Indicated Airspeed (IAS), deviation from Required Time of Arrival (RTA), average power usage, perceived workload, and pilot acceptance of DWs. Objective and subjective data were collected {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the number of DWs. Results: As the number of DW increased pilots mean altitude deviations decreased by 726 feet and standard deviations by 332 feet with a slight increase in perceived workload and one percent in power usage. Wind had a significant effect on RTA with mean times being within eleven seconds of each other. Pilots would prefer to have two DWs targets in each wind condition, and felt comfortable using DW to fly CDA. Conclusion and Application: The results showed that DWs can be used as an effective <b>cuing</b> <b>system</b> to enhance pilot ability to perform CDA, and that they are a potential choice for near to midterm implementation in improving the effectiveness of CDA approach and landing procedures...|$|E
