5000|$|After Navy {{acquisition}} and preliminary conversion, but before full conversion and commissioning, the Middleton was {{pressed into service}} during a shipping crisis involving securing the South Pacific lines of communication and critical air ferry route with Australia. New Caledonia (codename [...] "Poppy"), a key point in those lines, had been in some turmoil with Vichy governance and recent takeover by Free French and was threatened by the Japanese. Another key island, Bora Bora (codename [...] "Bobcat"), was also to be heavily reinforced in early 1942 yet available shipping was extremely short. Major realignment, taken {{to the head of}} state level, was required. The Bobcat convoy was to depart Charleston, South Carolina and, {{as a result of the}} candidate ship President Fillmore being damaged in a grounding with repairs taking longer than the <b>convoy</b> <b>schedule</b> allowed, the Arthur Middleton was quickly substituted and sent to Charleston from New York, but without proper ballasting for newly installed armament.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of our work on {{applying}} genetic algorithms combined with a discrete event simulation to the problem of convoy scheduling. We show that this approach can automatically remove conflicts from a <b>convoy</b> <b>schedule</b> thereby providing to the human operator the ability to search for better solutions after an initial conflict free schedule is obtained. We demonstrate that it is feasible to find a conflict free schedule for realistic problems in a few minutes on a common workstation or laptop.

50|$|A <b>convoy</b> <b>scheduled</b> to {{pass through}} the {{restricted}} area surrounding Dorado on the evening of 12 October reported no contact.|$|R
50|$|The Navy Armed Guard unit {{would travel}} with the {{merchant}} ship to its destination and return Stateside {{on the same}} ship, or another, depending on <b>convoy</b> <b>schedules.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{single issue}} driving {{nearly all the}} command's {{functions}} was availability and movement of shipping that was coordinated with the port but not under the sole control of the port. Troops and supplies had {{to be available to}} meet ship availability, the convoy cycle and sailing dates and adjustments made for events concerning ships from mechanical to weather and other demands. <b>Convoy</b> <b>schedules</b> were Navy controlled and all ship sailings required Navy clearance. <b>Convoy</b> <b>schedules</b> were determined in Washington by Navy and War Departments with a pre-sailing convoy conference held by the Office of the Port Director with local Navy, commanders of the escort vessels and masters of the convoy vessels attending to ensure final details of convoy assembly, operation and emergency actions were determined and understood.|$|R
50|$|With her repairs completed, Montclair was {{directed}} to join up with a <b>convoy</b> <b>scheduled</b> to depart New York on 19 October 1918. She made a successful transatlantic crossing this time, and arrived at Quiberon, France, on 6 November 1918; she discharged her cargo at St. Nazaire that day. The war ended {{while she was in}} France, on 11 November 1918.|$|R
50|$|With the German <b>convoy</b> <b>scheduled</b> to {{pass through}} {{a small town in}} Forbach, Sir Francis T. Woolridge and Thomas Hancock {{eliminate}} the town of all German resistance, allowing American soldiers to fortify the area and prepare for their arrival. The convoy arrives escorted by Tiger I tanks, but are ambushed as they enter the town. The trucks carrying Duchamp and Toledo are freed and the artwork recovered.|$|R
50|$|Embarkation camps were staging areas {{established}} to house and prepare troops {{for a period}} of usually a week, but sometimes up to two weeks, before embarkation overseas. At NYPOE the period in 1944 average time in camp ranged from 7.1 to 11.7 days. The camps were under the direct command of the Port Commander with responsibility to complete final training, equipping and other preparation of troops in coordination with troopship and <b>convoy</b> <b>schedules.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following this, the 2/13th {{joined the}} Tobruk garrison, as the port was surrounded. During the siege, the {{battalion}} occupied the perimeter and undertook defensive duties, remaining there for eight months, with {{the distinction of}} being the only Australian infantry battalion to see out the length of the siege, remaining alongside the new garrison built around the British 70th Division. The other Australian units were withdrawn earlier by sea and the intention had been {{to do the same for}} the 2/13th in October 1941, but the <b>convoy</b> <b>scheduled</b> to take the 2/13th out of Tobruk had been repelled by an Axis air attack and the British later asked for the battalion, less its advanced party which had already been evacuated, to remain for the subsequent break out attempt.|$|R
5000|$|The Mercantile Movements Division [...] {{originally}} {{known as}} the Convoy Section [...] was a component part of British Admiralty, Naval Staff department that coordinated, organised and plotted all Merchant Navy <b>convoys,</b> routing and <b>schedules</b> from 1917 until 1920.|$|R
50|$|In early December of 1942 the {{submarine}} resumed her sea operations, {{now part of}} the X Submarine Subgroup out of Augusta. Uarsciek and Topazio were assigned to screen and protect an important <b>convoy</b> (MV Foscolo) <b>scheduled</b> for transit in the Central Mediterranean and headed to Tripoli.|$|R
50|$|Under Resolution 776, the Protection Force was {{to provide}} {{protection}} to humanitarian organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other activities as requested by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees such as <b>scheduling</b> <b>convoys</b> and negotiating safe passage. The Force would also be permitted to use self-defence if armed persons attempted {{to prevent it from}} carrying out its mandate.|$|R
5000|$|Lawson's {{commando}} {{group is}} instructed {{to destroy the}} Japanese radio transmitter {{to prevent them from}} sounding the alarm about an American naval <b>convoy</b> which is <b>scheduled</b> to appear on the horizon in three days. The post's radio operator transmits an [...] "all's well" [...] signal every night at midnight; it will be Lawson's job to transmit a fake signal (in Japanese) to buy the Allies another 24 hours.|$|R
50|$|The main assault <b>convoy</b> was <b>scheduled</b> {{to begin}} landing on Malta just before midnight {{on the first}} day of the invasion, after the {{airborne}} forces had already landed during the afternoon hours and secured the heights above the selected beaches. The bulk of the first-wave assault troops would come from the Friuli Infantry Division (10,000 men) and Livorno Infantry Division (9,850) of the Italian XXX Corps. Also included were 1,200 men from the 1st Assault Battalion and Loreto Battalion (both drawn from the Regia Aeronautica); two battalions of San Marco Marines (2,000); three battalions of Blackshirts (1,900) and 300 Nuotatori (a commando unit of San Marco marines specially trained in ocean swimming and beach assault). Armour support comprised nineteen Semovente 47/32 and eight Semovente 75/18 self-propelled guns plus thirty L3 light tanks (comparable in size and armament to the British Bren Gun Carrier).|$|R
5|$|Deptford's {{economic}} {{history has been}} strongly connected to the Dockyard - when the Dockyard was thriving, so Deptford thrived; with the docks now all closed, Deptford has declined economically. However, areas of Deptford are being gradually re-developed and gentrified - and the local council has plans to regenerate the riverside and the town centre. A large former industrial site by the Thames called <b>Convoys</b> Wharf is <b>scheduled</b> for redeveloping into mixed use buildings. This will involve the construction of around 3,500 new homes and {{an extension of the}} town centre northwards towards the river.|$|R
50|$|The Takao <b>convoy</b> was <b>scheduled</b> {{to land at}} Agoo, a {{small village}} in La Union Province {{on the eastern shore}} of Lingayen Gulf {{beginning}} 0500 on 22 December. The Mako convoy was intended to start landing at 0550 hours at Caba, seven miles north of Agoo, and the Kamijima Detachment was to land at Bauang, seven miles north of Caba from 0730 hours. This was intended to give the IJA 14th Army a fifteen mile wide landing zone along the narrow coastal plain just north of the central plains of Luzon and protected from flanking counterattack from the east by the Cordillera Mountains. Once ashore, the troops were to move inland without consolidating the landing zone. The Kamijima Detachment in particular was to strike north to occupy San Fernando, and Baguio and to consolidate with the Vigan invasion force under Colonel Tanaka which was moving south along the coast. The remaining two forces were to press south past Rosario to secure the bank of the Agno River, the first major geographic obstacle on the road to Manila.|$|R
5000|$|Responsibility for {{the convoy}} system was {{administered}} by the Admiralty as early as 1914. A specific Convoy Section [...] of the Naval Staff was originally established 25 June 1917 {{as part of the}} Anti-Submarine Division with the appointment of an Organizing Manager of Convoys the Convoy Section coordinated with the Ministry of Shipping [...] who was responsible for Merchant Shipping and the Naval Intelligence Division to organise all <b>convoy,</b> routings and <b>schedules.</b> Although planning of routes for all convoys including there escorting vessels was usually supervised by the Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff [...] as he was responsible for trade protection and anti-submarine operations.|$|R
25|$|Empire Flint {{departed}} from Brixham on 22 November to join Convoy PW 434. On paper, the convoy had {{departed from}} Portsmouth on 21 November {{and arrived at}} Milford Haven on 23 November. However, Empire Flint was the only ship in the convoy. She arrived at Falmouth, Cornwall on 23 November. She sailed on 2 December to join Convoy PW 439. Like Convoy PW434, {{she was the only}} ship in the <b>convoy,</b> which was <b>scheduled</b> to have departed from Portsmouth on 1 December. She arrived at Milford Haven on 3 December. She sailed on 8 December to join Convoy ON 215, which departed from Liverpool on 9 December and arrived at New York on 28 December. Empire Flint arrived at Philadelphia that day.|$|R
500|$|Scharnhorst, Tirpitz, {{and nine}} destroyers {{embarked}} from Altafjord on an offensive on 6 September known as Operation Sicily; the ships were tasked with bombarding {{the island of}} Spitzbergen. During the operation, Scharnhorst destroyed a battery of two [...] guns and shelled fuel tanks, coal mines, harbor facilities, and military installations. Of particular importance was the weather station that was transmitting weather information to the Allies, which was used to <b>schedule</b> <b>convoys</b> to the Soviet Union. The destroyers landed some 1,000 troops, which pushed the Norwegian garrison into the mountains, completing the mission without major loss. On 22 September, a pair of British X-craft mini-submarines attacked and seriously damaged Tirpitz, which reduced the Arctic Task Force to Scharnhorst and her five escorting destroyers.|$|R

50|$|Having {{received}} orders on 13 February 1975 {{to proceed}} to rendezvous with ARG Alfa (TG 76.4) Vancouver consequently cancelled a port visit to Manila and a <b>scheduled</b> <b>Convoy</b> exercise and stood out, bound for the Gulf of Thailand. After operating in those waters (17-24 February), Vancouver and her consorts returned to Subic Bay on account of worsening weather on 25 February. In-port maintenance for ships and embarked aircraft ensued until 1 March at which time ARG Alfa sailed {{to return to the}} Gulf, to prepare for Operation Eagle Pull, the evacuation of Cambodia. TG 76.4 conducted training and preparations (5 March-12 April), punctuating those evolutions with swim calls on 20, 22, and 30 March to permit her crew to enjoy some relaxation.|$|R

25|$|With {{the success}} of the convoy system, the Royal Navy created a new Convoy Section and a Mercantile Movements Division at the Admiralty to work with the Ministry of Shipping and the Naval Intelligence Division to organise <b>convoys,</b> {{routings}} and <b>schedules.</b> Before this, the Norwegian convoys, coal convoys and Beef Trip convoys had often been arranged by local commanders. The Admiralty arranged the rendezvous, decided which ships would be escorted and in what order they would sail, but it left the composition of the escort itself to the Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth. The wing captain of the Southwest Air Group also received notification of the Admiralty′s convoys, and provided air cover as they approached their ports. The Enemy Submarine and Direction Finding Section and the code-breakers of Room 40 cooperated to give the convoy planners knowledge U-boat movements.|$|R
50|$|On 22 June 1941, the Soviet Union was {{attacked}} by troops of the Third Reich and Axis powers, and as a consequence, the Allied Power of Great Britain was also considered attacked. In {{the framework of the}} resolved military assistance for this country (Lend-Lease Act), Winston Churchill commissioned the British ambassador in Moscow, Stafford Cripps, to explore the options for collaboration. On 27 June, Cripps submitted the proposal of a British/Soviet operation to protect the <b>convoys</b> that were <b>scheduled</b> to travel through the North Sea to the destination ports of Murmansk and Archangelsk to the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov. At the same time, pilots of the VVS were briefed on British aircraft {{in order to be able}} to use them at a later date. During discussions in London on 9 July between British admirals and a Soviet delegation, as well as a cabinet session by day appointed for this purpose, the proposal was confirmed.|$|R
500|$|On 25–26 September, Oldenburg and {{the rest}} of I Squadron covered an advance {{conducted}} by the II Führer der Torpedoboote (Leader of Torpedo Boats) to the Terschelling Bank. Scheer conducted another fleet operation on 18–20 October {{in the direction of the}} Dogger Bank, though again they failed to find British forces. For the majority of 1917, Oldenburg was assigned to guard duty in the German Bight. During Operation Albion, the amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, Oldenburg and her three sisters were moved to the Danish straits to block any possible British attempt to intervene. On 28 October the four ships arrived in Putzig Wiek, and from there steamed to Arensburg on 29 October. On 2 November the operation was completed and Oldenburg and her sisters began the voyage back to the North Sea. A final abortive fleet sortie took place on 23–24 April 1918. Scheer had intended to intercept a British convoy to Norway and destroy the escorting battleships. During the operation, the battlecruiser [...] suffered mechanical problems and had to be towed back to port. Oldenburg took the ship in tow, and the main body of the fleet turned back to Germany while Hipper searched in vain for the convoy. German intelligence had incorrectly placed the date for the <b>scheduled</b> <b>convoy</b> on 24 April, and after several hours of fruitless steaming, Hipper turned for port as well. By 18:37, the fleet was outside the Jade and Moltke had been repaired enough to allow her to enter port under her own power.|$|R
40|$|Improvised Explosive Devices, or IEDs, {{have become}} a {{familiar}} and lethal part of contemporary military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, producing more casualties than any other weapons system. One reason for their success is their practicality in an environment characterized by imbalances in the capabilities of opposing forces. The military forces conducting stability operations in Iraq and Afghanistan rely on the existing road networks to support logistical and operational movements. Insurgents with limited firepower and maneuver capabilities can place a bomb {{on the side of}} a road and detonate it anonymously to cause catastrophic effects on a passing convoy. Route clearance teams were developed to combat the emerging threat of IEDs. Capable of detecting IEDs with minimal risk to troops, route clearance teams move along the road network in search of these destructive devices. This thesis explores a mathematical approach to planning and scheduling route clearance missions. To achieve this objective, we first develop a probability-based model of IED activities on a road network used by occupation forces. We then use approximate dynamic programming methods to generate potential route clearance missions that are effective at reducing the risk of IED attacks. Once the paths are generated, they are inputted into a mixed integer program that finds the most risk-reducing combination of missions that can feasibly be executed, given constraints on the availability of route clearance teams. (cont.) A route clearance schedule and its associated risk-reduction metrics result. We conduct several experiments on the methods developed to test its validity and applicability. Our first experiment examines the effects of mission timing on IED risk reduction, and shows the difficulty in relating this timing to our knowledge of IED risk in the road network. The second experiment demonstrates the trade-offs associated with assigning different sectors of the road network to different route clearance teams versus assigning all teams to the entire network. Our last experiment confirms the value of having <b>convoy</b> and patrol <b>schedules</b> available when conducting route clearance planning. We conclude that the planning method developed, integrated with a graphical control interface, would provide a useful decision support tool for military planners scheduling route clearance operations. by Christopher E.
