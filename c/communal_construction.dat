This paper concentrates on what may be called ‘feasting areas’. Indeed, from Early Minoan times onwards, outside gathering places seem to have played a decisive role in the social dynamics of Bronze Age Crete. As main theater of co-presence and interaction, such areas constituted the main arena of practices contributing to social (re) production. During the Neopalatial period, these ‘spaces of convergence’ are characterized by a remarkable heterogeneity: on the one hand they remain external, ranging from the clearly circumscribed Central Court of the ‘palaces’ to the Plateia of some settlements, or even to some rather shapeless, non distinct area. On the other hand, built space often materializes an internal spatial solidarity. How can we explain this variety of gathering places? Do they imply different levels of practices? Are they part of the same cultural dramaturgy or theaters of different plays? By approaching some of these arenas through an archaeological and spatial analysis, this paper tries to underline some peculiarities of social space and communal activities in the Neopalatial period. At the same time we explore the possibility that Minoan ‘palaces’ were <b>communal</b> <b>constructions</b> rather than elite buildings, hierarchically imposed on society...|$|R

40|$|Community choirs enact {{notions of}} {{community}} {{often based on}} the assumption that community singing bridges and celebrates cultural diversity through shared musical experiences. What makes Common Thread Community Chorus of Toronto unique among community choirs in Toronto is an explicitly political focus to its musical community-building efforts. This paper explores how the construction of community within Common Thread is predicated on the notion of cultural inclusion through musical, social, and political dimensions. Drawing from research conducted with the choir in 2010 that explored the social and musical experiences of choir members, I argue that the relationships between choral members’ socio-musical experiences and the choir’s construction of community are predicated on particular notions of multiculturalism and inclusion based on a partially visible White normative centre. I will first interrogate how community is constructed within the choir through a complex system of multicultural/multilingual repertoires, musical practices, and sociocultural accessibility measures. The second part of the presentation will focus on Common Thread’s construction of community situated within larger local and global activities and discourses of social justice. Drawing from political theory and adult education theory, I explore Common Thread’s construction of community through the problematic field of identity-differences. The concept of identity-differences locates individual and <b>communal</b> <b>constructions</b> of self in relation to others as complex composites of intersecting power relations. Identity-differences are collective and relational, which often (although not inevitably) insinuate the construction of otherness into its logic. This research raises significant questions for consideration in the development of choral rehearsal and performance practices and structures that seek to diversify membership through bridging differences within and beyond singing communities...|$|R

40|$|This study {{traces the}} {{circumstances}} that allowed the imagination of militant Hindu cultural and political identities in Lucknow between 1880 and 1930. It documents the efforts of men active {{in the public sphere}} to create a larger and more empowering role for themselves in the city through redefining codes of respectability, and creating for themselves a middle class identity distinct from that of the traditional and new elites of colonial Lucknow, as well as the lower classes. Based on empirical data gathered from the archives of the colonial state, and a close reading of the writings of educated men active in Lucknow 2 ̆ 7 s public sphere, this dissertation describes the multiple responses of such activists to the dislocations and possibilities created by colonial rule in Lucknow. A search for sources of greater empowerment and respect led Hindu middle class activists to find in an assertive, public Hindu religiosity, the locus of an empowering identity. Such constructions of Hindu religiosity were not necessarily antagonistic to Muslims. It was at times when Hindu activists perceived challenges to their hegemonic projects from parallel projects among Muslims, that a militant Hindu identity came to be constructed around hostility towards Muslims. Through a close study of Lucknow, this dissertation argues that modern political and cultural identities in colonial India were intimately connected with the concerns and politics of middle class activists. The articulation of a militant Hindu identity however, was only one of the many modes of empowerment available to these activists. The same concerns that drove middle class activists to articulate identities around militant Hindu constructions, also led them to endorse other ideological and political agenda which undercut their own <b>communal</b> <b>constructions.</b> Middle class politics, as much as it contributed to the rhetoric and politics of a militant Hindu identity, also placed limits on such constructions. The social base and ideological orientation of middle class activists, therefore ensured that identities they forged through their interventions in the public sphere remained shifting, protean and impermanent constructs. ...|$|R

This controversy broadened to include activist {{on both sides and}} incorporate a wide range of activist tools. Through a case study of this controversy, a few items are made obvious. The most prominent is that boycotting is no longer likely to be a successful mode of activism. Rather buycotting, using purchasing power to reward companies, is likely to become the dominate mode of activism moving forward. More broadly, in this thesis I develop that consumerism is a space for identity building and interaction in our society. I intend that consumption generates a space for negotiation of meaning and values within a consumer society. This is a space through which consumers can make reflective choices about companies and actions that they support or oppose. Within this case, there were clear instances of both individual and <b>communal</b> identity <b>construction</b> and narrative building, as well as negotiation between political and religious narratives. Consumer action allowed people to express their support or disdain for Chick-fil-A 2 ̆ 7 s stance on same-sex marriage.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{evaluation}} of tenders for <b>communal</b> <b>construction</b> procurement. Each year the public procurement equals {{the value of}} millions of Swedish kronors, of which construction projects makes up a large proportion. These projects tend to often exceed their budgets.

The theoretical framework for the study partly consists of a review on how the communal evaluation work is described in law and practice. A qualitative methodology is applied in the study where four procurement workers are interviewed. Similarities and differences between evaluation work in practice and what is described in the study's theoretical framework is been analyzed. One of several conclusions {{of the study is}} that the choice of contractual form for the construction work often determines the choice of procurement form. Hence the person that works with modeling of tender documents should be well acquainted with the construction industry. A boundary that was set for the study is that it geographically covers Sweden exclusively. Suggestions for further research include investigating why international construction companies bidding in Sweden on <b>communal</b> <b>construction</b> projects do not seem to function properly...|$|E

40|$|The huge {{investment}} {{required for}} the erection and eventual running of the Maltese megalithic complexes highlights their {{central role in the}} temple builders’ <b>communal</b> life.

40|$|The role {{of memory}} in disaster-prone places is {{essential}} to face disaster events, which, in time, can also shape city-making. Communities that live in disaster-prone places tend to react from instincts passed down through generations, rather than acting per protocols or planning by a centralised administrative organisation. This is evidenced not only in communal behaviours in the wake and aftermath of an event, but is also tangible in urban infrastructure, where its construction responds to a very local sense of belonging and attachment. Thus, I argue that <b>communal</b> knowledge <b>construction</b> in disaster-prone places relies on memory of a trans-generational origin, where memory is re-signified from event to event, empowering present communities to thrive {{in the face of}} disaster. Moreover, I propose that memory is a core aspect in city-making for these communities and in the construction of place, in behavioural and urban facets. This paper is a product of subjective analysis applied to Valparaiso, a coastal city of Chile, and its major disaster events of 1866, 1906 and 2014. I designed data collection to gather impressions, reactions and life experiences of affected communities through interviews and archival work related to historic disasters. During fieldwork, my main questions regarded memory and city-making as important aspects to face historic disaster events. Data analysis was organised by emerging issues that participants regarded as most relevant explanations for disaster experiences, applying intersubjective interpretation to their narratives. From this research, I aim to position qualitative methods, as a diverse analytical tool, equal in importance to traditional quantitative frameworks of disaster studies. Although this research is a single case study, the identification of memory as an essential part of disaster understanding can help to improve preparation and readiness protocols in disaster-prone places...|$|R

40|$|Refugee people {{experience}} many trials prior to arriving in Australia and face ongoing challenges associated with re-settlement. Despite facing such difficulties many refugee people demonstrate enormous strength and resilience that facilitates their re-settlement process. The authors' experience however suggests that professionals working with refugee {{people tend to}} focus on the trauma story to the neglect of their strengths. At times this means resilience is overshadowed by a dominant Western deficits model that defines refugee people as traumatised victims. Pathologising the trauma story of refugee people may further alienate refugee people from full inclusion into Australian life by denying their inherent resilience in the face of extraordinary life experiences. This article reviews Australian and International literature to explore factors that contribute to refugee resilience such as personal qualities, support and religion. The review also identifies elements that may impede resilience including; language barriers, racism, discrimination, and labelling the trauma story. The literature suggests refugee resilience moves beyond the Western individualised notion of resilience to a more <b>communal</b> <b>construction</b> of resilience that includes refugee people's broader social context. The literature highlights important practice implications and the authors respond to the findings by reflecting on their own practice experience and considering implications for a more inclusive anti-oppressive strengths-based approach to work with refugee people.

40|$|Recent {{scholarship}} in the historiography of feminism {{has sought to}} challenge certain received histories of the movement which seem likely to obscure the social, intellectual and political complexity of the past, and indeed of the present. With good reason, such research has often preferred to focus on general intellectual currents rather than individual cases. This paper, however, focuses on some common constructions of one feminist in particular: philosopher and theologian Mary Daly (1928 - 2010). I hope to demonstrate that an analysis of one individual’s positioning within feminism’s history, {{as well as in}} relation to a conception of correct intellectual practice for women’s studies, can prove useful for broader attempts to make more complex our conceptions of feminist chronology, as well as for scholarship seeking to interrogate the institutional factors feeding into such stories. Through readings of both Daly’s own texts and those of her critics, this paper seeks to understand Daly’s positioning both in a common history of feminist progression, and in a concomitant story about the type of intellectual work appropriate to women’s studies. The central claim is that, in the constructions of Daly I examine, she is positioned as spatially external to the community and conversation of women’s studies as academic discipline, as well as temporally behind that conversation. This positioning is not unilateral, but itself feeds off as well as into Daly’s own self-positioning in relation to women’s studies. The constructions of Daly I am figuring are therefore not impositions but rather works of <b>communal</b> <b>construction</b> to some extent, since both Daly and her critics are intellectual agents who produce, maintain and modify stories about feminist history as well as women’s studies as discipline...|$|E

Conservation practitioners recognize that long-term solutions should include altering human behaviors, and public education and enforcement of wildlife-related laws are two management actions frequently implemented, but with little empirical evidence evaluating their success.

As implemented, we found little support for education, or enforcement {{in the form of}} daily patrolling in changing human behavior, but found more support for proactive enforcement, i. e., dispensing warning notices. More broadly we demonstrated the value of gathering evidence before and after implementing conservation actions, and the dangers of measuring responses in the absence of ecological knowledge. We recommend development of more effective educational methods, application of proactive enforcement, and continued evaluation of tools by directly measurin...|$|R

Agency is an important feature for the way new immigrants challenge the phenomenon of deterritorialization through transnationalism, which includes immigrant students 2 ̆ 7 ability to maintain a strong sense of 2 ̆ 2 home 2 ̆ 2 through their new sense of place and space located in a global society (Santiago-Irizarry, 2008). Since the official religion of Pakistan is Islam, a majority of the immigrant students are Muslim. Therefore, the impact of American culture on the Pakistani immigrant students 2 ̆ 7 religious identity will also be explored in this qualitative study...|$|R
