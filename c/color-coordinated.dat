50|$|For the {{cross-country}} phase, {{the rider}} usually uses similar tack {{as for the}} show jumping. However, cross country boots are used for extra protection, to help prevent injury {{if they were to}} hit the solid obstacles. Most horses that wear shoes are also fitted with horse shoe studs, to prevent slipping. At the upper levels, riders may also apply a grease or lard {{to the front of the}} horse's legs, to help the horse slide over fences if they hang a leg. Riders also tend to <b>color-coordinate</b> their cross-country tack to their colors. For example, using the same color saddle pad and tape for their boots, to match their shirt and protective vest.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of the Japanese {{pavilion}} at the Venice Biennale in 1993, a dazzling mirrored room filled with small pumpkin sculptures in which she resided in <b>color-coordinated</b> magician's attire, Kusama went on to produce a huge, yellow pumpkin sculpture covered with an optical pattern of black spots. The pumpkin came to represent for her a kind of alter-ego or self-portrait. Kusama's later installation I'm Here, but Nothing (2000–2008) is a simply furnished room consisting of table and chairs, place settings and bottles, armchairs and rugs, however its walls are tattooed with hundreds of fluorescent polka dots glowing in the UV light. The result is an endless infinite space where the self and everything in the room is obliterated.|$|E

Not wanting to get roped into being receptionist again, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) defies Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) orders to answer the phone. With {{the rest of the}} staff similarly declining to answer the phone, Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, <b>color-coordinates</b> the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt {{to talk him out of}} his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.|$|R
40|$|In this report, five {{systems of}} varied diameters viz. 62 nm, 85 nm, 115 nm, 160 nm and 450 nm of BaMgAl 10 O 17 :Eu 2 + {{nanorods}} are prepared by solution combustion approach and with annealing at different temperature in reduced atmosphere (N 2 + H 2). An intense broad blue photoluminescence (PL), {{corresponding to the}} electronic transition of Eu 2 + from the 4 f 6 5 d excited state to the 4 f 7 ground state, is observed. The blue-shift and enhanced photoluminescence is also observed, and found to be highly dependent {{on the size of}} diameter of BaMgAl 10 O 17 :Eu 2 + nanostructures. The change in decay time and <b>color-coordinates</b> with change in size of diameter of BaMgAl 10 O 17 :Eu 2 + nanostructure have been analysed and thoroughly discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in 1973 special Luxury Group {{packages}} {{were offered}} in various paint, roof, and interior color schemes {{from year to}} year. The Silver Luxury Group for 1973 included Silver [...] "Moondust" [...] metallic paint with a matching silver grained vinyl roof and a silver leather interior. Or, if the buyer preferred a color contrast, Cranberry (deep red) velour or leather interior trim was available. For 1974, a Gold Luxury Group and a Saddle & White Luxury Group (April 1974 introduction) joined the carryover Silver Luxury Group. For 1975, a Blue Diamond Luxury Group and a Lipstick & White Luxury Group joined the three carryover packages from the previous model year. For 1976, in addition to certain ones that carried over from the previous model year, Lincoln offered {{a dizzying array of}} new Luxury Group packages: Jade/White, Light Jade/Dark Jade, Red/Rose, Gold/Cream, Black Diamond (March 1976 introduction), and Desert Sand (March 1976 introduction).

40|$|This, study {{investigated}} the relationships among a list :Of 23 protein biomarkers with CIE-L*a*b* meat-Color traits and ultimate pH on Longissimus thoracis (LT) and Rectus abdominis (RA) muscles of 48 {{protected designation of origin}} Maine Anjou, cows. The technological parameters were correlated with several biomarkers and were in some cases muscle-dependent. More biomarkers were related to pHu in LT,than in RA muscle. Some consistencies were found, by the common correlation of pHu with MyHC-IIa and MyHC-ILx. The pHu of the LT muscle was also correlated with other cytoskeletal entities and proteins belonging to metabolism and cellular stress. In contrast-to the relationships found between biomarkers and LT pHu, more proteins were related to the instrumental <b>color-coordinates</b> in RA than in LT muscle. The regression equations were parameter and muscle-dependent. Certain of "the retained,protein explained more than one color coordinate. Hsp 70 -Grp 75 was positive in the models of L*, a*, b*, and c*-of LT and of b* in the RA muscle. Further heat shock proteins were strongly related with the" meat color coordinates in both-muscles.

50|$|Since the 1940s {{there has}} been a series of artistic works on display from the art college Académie de l'art populaire congolais, founded by Pierre Romain Desfossés. The {{collection}} consists of works by various artists, among which is Pili-Pili Mulongby who painted <b>color-coordinated</b> poetic landscapes and animal depictions. Furthermore, there are Bela Borkémas and Mwenze Kibwanga. Borkémas developed his own fingerpainting technique which enabled him to achieve effects similar to those of European Pointillism, and Kibwanga produced paintings depicting fantastic and dramatic scenes, such as birds of prey with giant wings or fights between men and animals.|$|E

Another aspect of their routine is their on-stage antics such as human bowling (diving head-first into bowling pins), pretending to hit each other with chairs in imitation of pro-wrestlers, and mid-performance piggyback rides. They often allow audience members on stage to join in on the fun, and often dive into the audience or hang from a balcony as part of their act.|$|E
50|$|Horses shown saddle seat {{generally}} {{are left with}} a very long, flowing mane that is not trimmed or pulled. Tennessee Walking Horses, five-gaited American Saddlebreds, three-gaited pleasure, and park Saddlebreds, and other gaited breeds that adhere closely to their traditions, are usually shown with a full mane and forelock, though the forelock and the first lock of the mane may be braided with satin ribbon, which is <b>color-coordinated</b> with the browband of the bridle and the rider's outfit. (In recent years, the trend amongst Saddlebred exhibitors is to shave off the forelock.) On the other hand, Arabian and Morgan horses show with a full mane and tail with no additions; exhibitors are specifically prohibited from braiding or adding ribbons to their horses.|$|E
