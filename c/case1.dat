6000|$|In {{yet another}} <b>case(1)</b> {{grotesque}} hunting adventures of Baiame are {{told in the}} mysteries, and illustrated by the sacred temporary representations in raised earth. I did not know it; I merely followed Mr. Howitt. But I do not doubt it. My reply is, that there was [...] "something sacred" [...] in Greek mysteries, something purifying, ennobling, consoling. For this Lobeck has collected (and disparaged) the evidence of Pindar, Sophocles, Cicero and many others, while even Aristophanes, as Prof. Campbell remarks, says: [...] "We only have bright sun and cheerful life who have been initiated and lived piously in regard to strangers and to private citizens".(2) Security and peace of mind, {{in this world and}} for the next, were, we know not how, borne into the hearts of Pindar and Sophocles in the Mysteries. Yet, if we may at all trust the Fathers, there were scenes of debauchery, as at the Mysteries of the Fijians (Nanga) there was buffoonery ("to amuse the boys," [...] Mr. Howitt says of some Australian rites), the story of Baubo is only one example, and, in other mysteries than the Eleusinian, we know of mummeries in which an absurd tale of Zeus is related in connection with an oak log. Yet surely there was [...] "something sacred" [...] in the faith of Zeus! Let us judge the Australians as we judge Greeks. The precepts as to [...] "speaking the straightforward truth," [...] as to unselfishness, avoidance of quarrels, of wrongs to [...] "unprotected women," [...] of unnatural vices, are certainly communicated in the Mysteries of some tribes, with, in another, knowledge of the name and nature of [...] "Our Father," [...] Munganngaur. That a Totemistic dance, or medicine-dance of Emu hunting, is also displayed(3) at certain Mysteries of a given tribe, and that Baiame is spoken of as the hero of this ballet, no more deprives the Australian moral and religious teaching (at the Mysteries) of sacred value, than the stupid indecency whereby Baubo made Demeter laugh destroys the sacredness of the Eleusinia, on which Pindar, Sophocles and Cicero eloquently dwell. If the Australian mystae, at the most solemn moment of their lives, are shown a dull or dirty divine ballet d'action, what did Sophocles see, after taking a swim with his pig? Many things far from edifying, yet the sacred element of religious hope and faith was also represented. So it is in Australia.|$|E

40|$|AIM:To {{evaluate}} the clinical effects of scleral buckling {{for the early}} retinal detachment eyes with silicone oil tamponaded. METHODS: This retrospective observation included 26 cases(26 eyes) who had the signs of early retinal detachment after the silicone oil tamponaded under 15 days. All the cases received scleral buckling and were observed with the change of retinal reattachment, visual acuity and intraocular pressure(IOP) for 6 - 18 months. RESULTS: All 26 cases(26 eyes) had the retinal detachment at the inferior side. The retina of 22 cases(22 eyes) was anatomical attached(92 %) after the operation and 4 cases(4 eyes) accepted another time of silicone oil tamponaded. The visual acuity improved in 22 cases(22 eyes), 3 cases(3 eyes) had no change and 1 <b>case(1</b> eye) decreased. The IOP increased at early period after the operation and became normal after 3 months.

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} {{the safety and}} complications of femtosecond laser corneal small incision lenticule extraction(SMILE) procedure and discuss the prevention and treatment. METHODS: We retrospectively studied the complications of 403 patients(799 eyes) with myopia and myopic astigmatism treated by SMILE. RESULTS: All the patients underwent the operation successfully. Only 1 <b>case(1</b> eye) suffered from dark spot and changed to femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK(FS-LASIK), 5 cases(5 eyes, 0. 6 %) suffered from the suction loss, 11 cases(17 eyes, 2. 1 %) developed opaque bubble layer. All patients gained perfect uncorrected visual acuity(UCVA) (20 / 20). The best corrected visual acuity(BCVA) did not decrease after operations. The incidence of haze and diffuse lamellar keratitis was low(0. 3 % and 0. 4 %, respectively) and no other complications were observed. There was 9 eyes in 6 patients(1. 1 %) found regression of refraction at 6 mo after surgery, while the UCVA of rest patients reached 1. 0 at 3 mo after surgery. CONCLUSION: The SMILE procedure has high safety for myopia and myopic astigmatism.

Methods A total of 80 patients with middle lobe syndrome,received and cured from June 1996 to August 2010 and conformed by pathological studies,were made to undergo retrospective analysis. Results Among the 80 cases(47 males and 33 females,aged 5 to 81 years {{with an average age}} of 54. 5 years) of middle lobe syndrome, 52 cases showed five big clinic symptoms that include cough,expectoration,fever,chest pain,or hemoptysis,whereas 28 cases showed no symptoms. The chest x-ray result showed that the right heart edge appeared fuzzy or atelectasis triangle appeared shadowy. The chest enhanced CT scan showed swollen lymph nodes {{at the root of the}} middle lobe,and tumors could be detected in the lumen of right middle lobe bronchus. The positive rate of fiber-optic bronchoscopy was 46. 6 %(21 / 45). The surgical procedures included simple lobectomy in 47 cases(58. 8 %),bilobectomy in 28 cases(35 %,including sleeve resection of four cases),right pneumonectomy in one <b>case(1.</b> 2 %),and partial resection in four cases(5 %). Successful operation had been achieved in all the cases,and no occurrence of death was noted. Conclusions The clinical manifestations of the middle lobe syndrome are non-specific.

40|$|AIM: To study {{curative}} {{effect of}} Ranibizumab with Ex-PRESS drainage device for neovascular glaucoma. METHODS: From January 2012 to December 2014 in our hospital, 51 cases(62 eyes) with neovascular glaucoma were enrolled as the research objects. Under the unified enrolling criteria and measuring methods, {{according to the}} actual clinical situation and combined with the doctor's judgment, the patients were divided into control group with 23 cases(28 eyes) and observation group with 28 cases(34 eyes). The patients in observation group received the injection of ranibizumab combined the Ex-PRESS drainage device implantation. The patients in control group were only given the Ex-PRESS drainage device implantation. The vision, intraocular pressure(IOP) before and after treatments were compared {{as well as the}} outcomes and incidences of adverse reactions of the two groups. RESULTS: Before treatments, IOP of the two groups did not have statistically significant different(P > 0. 05). After treatments, IOP of the two groups were significantly lower, and the differences were statistically significant(P P P > 0. 05). After treatments, the visual acuity of the control group improved in 2 cases(3 eyes), didn't change in 18 cases(22 eyes), and declined in 3 cases(3 eyes). While the visual acuity of observation group improved in 12 cases(12 eyes), didn't change in 15 cases(21 eyes), and declined in 1 <b>case(1</b> eye). The distribution of the visual acuity of the two groups was significantly different(P P P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION: For patients with neovascular glaucoma, the injection of ranibizumab combined with the Ex-PRESS the drainage device implantation can effectively reduce IOP, improve visual function in patients with impaired visual function or delay the recession of visual function, with outstanding curative effect, high security features and is worthy of clinical application...|$|E

The Jacobian Conjecture is established: If f 1, · · ·, fn be {{elements}} in a polynomial ring k[X 1, · · ·, Xn] over a field k of characteristic zero such that det(∂fi/∂Xj) is a nonzero constant, then k[f 1, · · ·, fn] = k[X 1, · · ·, Xn]. Let k be an algebraically closed field, let k n be an affine space of dimension n over k and let f: k n − → k n be a morphism of algebraic varieties. Then f is given by coordinate functions f 1, [...] ., fn, where fi ∈ k[X 1, [...] ., Xn] and k n = Max(k[X 1, [...] .,Xn]). If f has an inverse morphism, then the Jacobian det(∂fi/∂Xj) is a nonzero constant. This follows from the easy chain rule. The Jacobian Conjecture asserts the converse. If k is of characteristic p> 0 and f(X) = X + X p, then df/dX = f ′ (X) = 1 but X can not be expressed as a polynomial in f. Thus we must assume the characteristic of k is zero. The conjecture can be stated as follows: The Jacobian Conjecture.

Let L be a finite Galois extension of the quotient field of B and let D be an integral closure of B in L. If D is etale over B then D = B. Proof. We may assume that k = C, the field of complex numbers by ”Lefschetz Principle ” (cf. [4, p. 290]). The extension D/B is etale and finite, and so Max(D) → Max(B) ∼ = C n is a (connected) covering.
