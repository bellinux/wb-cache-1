40|$|Delay and {{disruption}} on United Kingdom (UK) construction projects {{is estimated to}} cost the industry approximately eight billion pounds per annum (Pickavance. K., 2003) and leads to the delayed handover of construction projects, increases in project costs, poor commercial and legal relationships, client dissatisfaction, and damage to the image and reputation of the UK’s construction industry. In October 2002, the United Kingdoms (UK’s) Society of Construction Law (SOCL) published a delay {{and disruption}} protocol aimed at addressing the issues associated with delay and disruption on UK construction projects {{in the context of}} the UK’s legal system and standard forms of construction contracts. This paper reviews and compares the clauses of three of the most significant and commonly used (Stephenson, 2004) nationally applicable standard forms of construction contracts (AS 2124 - 1992, AS 4000 - 1997, and PC- 1 1998) in Australia, with the requirements of the protocol as a preliminary assessment of the suitability for adoption of the UK’s SOCL’s delay and disruption protocol for use by the Australian construction industry as a means of minimising the effects of delay on Australian construction projects, and as a means of identifying issues associated with the implementation and administration of the protocols requirements that may be applicable to the Australian construction industry. Conclusions are that the suitability of the protocol for adoption for use with nationally applicable Australian standard forms of construction contracts is dependent upon the contract chosen, and the protocols contractual status. As a guidance document used to assist in the management of delay events the protocol is wholly suitable for adoption by the Australian construction industry. Should the protocol be given contractual status, implementing some of the protocols recommendations would be in direct conflict with a number of the major clauses of the Australian standard forms of construction contracts considered, requiring the re-drafting of the relevant contractual clauses, and/or the protocol, to comply with the parties’ <b>contractual</b> <b>intentions...</b>|$|R

"In {{so far as}} the {{reduction}} of costs of production and distribution thus achieved is reflected in reduced prices, society as a whole ultimately benefits from the use of standard contracts… The use of contracts has, however, another aspect which has become increasingly important. Standard contracts are typically used by enterprises with strong bargaining power.

40|$|The {{rationale}} {{underlying the}} fixtures and accession presumptions {{is the need}} to protect the value of the chattel as well as the need to protect third-party interests. The destruction of the independent legal status of an attached chattel is generally deemed appropriate where the value of the co-mingled asset will be diminished if the chattel retains a separate legal title and this would generate unfairness because third parties have dealt with the co-mingled asset {{on the basis of its}} overall value. Rights to remove have evolved under both common law and equity to moderate the scope of these presumptions. Common law will uphold the right of a tenant to remove chattels that have been attached to leased premises during the currency of the lease. Equity on the other hand will uphold the right to remove affixed chattels in circumstances where the enforcement of such an entitlement is consistent with <b>contractual</b> <b>intention</b> and transactional fairness. This article examines the different rights of removal that have evolved under Australian law to date and the emergent statutory framework supporting these rights. It discusses the historical purpose and structural utility of these entitlements within a land framework that supports fixtures presumptions. Rights of removal, whether validated at law or in equity, confer positive entitlements upon the holder to access and remove affixed goods in circumstances where, because of the fixtures and accession presumptions, those goods no longer retain any separate legal status. The capacity of the holder to enforce this right against third parties is illustrative of their distinctive proprietary perspective...|$|E
40|$|In the UK {{over the}} last 50 years, legal {{developments}} in relation to extensions of time and/or monetary compensation for delays in construction and engineering projects, have been both cautious and incremental. In order {{to contend with the}} practical difficulties inherent in these industries, the courts have established various common law concepts and principles. The efficacy of many of those principles remains to a degree intractable, perhaps none more so than those relating to concurrent delays. Abstracted from wider doctoral research into how extension of time and/or monetary claims are dealt with in the UK courts, this paper explores the concept of concurrent delays and explains (through analysis of case law and legal commentary) how recent court decisions have, in effect, confirmed a doctrinal split between English and Scots Law. The paper also identifies the reasons for those differences, and poses further questions which require to be investigated and addressed, in order to move towards a more satisfactory and consistent approach as to how the UK courts deal with concurrent delay. Unless and until more is done to stabilise the common law concepts and principles relating to concurrent delay, such as arriving at a definitive working definition, determine conclusively the ratio for adopting the dominant cause test (or otherwise), adequately clarify why the prevention principle should (or should not) prevail, elaborate on critical path methodologies and justify which approach to causation to apply and why, then confusion over how concurrent delay will be dealt with by the judiciary will remain unsettled. Perhaps the most expeditious and pragmatic way to settle issues relating to concurrent delay should, in the first instance, be dealt with in the various standard forms of contract. This is justified as a reliance on common law principles to provide an equitable solution to concurrent delays, has had limited success. Indeed the current approach has witnessed UK judges struggling to harmonise their decisions, given under differing contract conditions and compounded by often opaque evidential constraints on projects which are factually complex. It is suggested that until concurrent delay clauses are incorporated into the standard forms, the current approach engendered by the courts, will be susceptible to imprecise, unreliable and incorrect judgements, which may not reflect the original <b>contractual</b> <b>intentions</b> of the parties...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the absence of}} paper and the challenges of transposing the traditional legal concepts of “writing” and “document” into an environment consisting of interactive and interconnected files. Both “writing” and “documents” are concepts that rely on tangible carriers, such as paper. [FN 1] Accordingly, legal principles involving either concept presume not only a certain durability, but also the stability and confinement of the information conveyed. What happens when writing is no longer contained on paper? Can writing exist without documents? Is it correct {{to speak of a}} “document” if its contents are transient and its scope is difficult to determine? At the current stage of development, legal analysis is incapable of answering any of these questions. Apart from exposing the inadequacy of popular attempts at replicating writing and documents in Internet transactions, this article provides new points of departure for future legal analysis and regulatory efforts in the area of e-commerce. Despite the intuitive association of the terms “writing” and “document” with formalities, this article * 5 has broader implications. Statute of fraud requirements aside, writing and documents serve as tools of conveying <b>contractual</b> <b>intentions.</b> At the most basic level, a contract must be certain and complete to be enforceable; the contents of the statements made by the transacting parties must be identifiable. The fulfillment of formal requirements seems to be of little value if it is unclear what obligations can actually be enforced. The mainstream approaches to the concepts of “writing” and “document” are best tested when confronted with Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), a suite of technologies enabling Web pages to partially refresh the displayed content in real time. Admittedly, tying a legal argument to a specific technology may affect its general relevance and condemn it to oblivion once the technology in question declines in popularity. It must, however, be emphasized that AJAX symbolizes an irreversible shift in Web development. Even if the technologies represented by the acronym lose their significance or become obsolete, the World Wide Web will have permanently shifted to more interactive and dynamic interfaces. Accordingly, problems of reconceptualizing traditional legal concepts in light of such developments will persist...|$|R

40|$|The rise of {{the digital}} {{environment}} and the Internet during the last decades resulted {{in a number of}} novel issues in the field of intellectual property rights (IPRs) and Internet contract (IC) regulation. Many doctrinal approaches have attempted to elaborate adequate models for the management of IPRs and IC implementation. From the technical point of view, several solutions to managing IPRs and implementing IC exist. We still miss, however, a fullyfledged theoretical framework that articulates the features of the new kinds of property that arise in relation to digital goods and the role of users’ input. The lack of a legal and regulatory theory of new kinds of property is often at the origin of provisions that are not very accurate or stringent to the users who are held accountable and responsible for their actions. The aim of this dissertation is to suggest basic subject-matter design principles that should be taken into account when drafting and enacting intellectual property and contract laws: Principle 1 : Provide precise, clear, and unambiguous definitions of key concepts and terms such as intangible property, intangible property rights, intangible property works and goods, IPM. This principle is needed for achieving a certain level of legal certainty and limiting the scope of the laws implementation. The analysis of existing intellectual property (IP) and IC laws in different jurisdictions across continents suggests that according to the development and creation of new forms of creativity it is possible to defining core terms of intangible property protection. Principle 2 : Enforce IP legislation in the context of intangible property provisions. The review of legal regimes under various legal frameworks as well as the overview of legislation in the U. S. and in Europe suggests that intangible property provisions tend to change the allocation of rights previously embodied in the respective national IP laws. Particularly significant shifts can be observed in areas such as rights of use, access, communication and traditional user privileges such as fair use or the 'right' to make private copies. Thus, it is crucial to carefully design the framework applicable to IPM, provide appropriate mechanisms for the effective enforcement of rights, analyse the interplay of the exception regime with the other core elements of the IP framework. Principle 3 : Enforce IC discretion with regard to principles of contract law and remedies and adhere to the principle of the new transaction environment. IC frameworks provide some degrees of flexibility in new method of manifesting <b>contractual</b> <b>intention</b> and analytical process of establishing the contents of a contract. Establishing the obligations of the parties should carefully consider the analytical process of defining the contents of a contract, thereby following the principle of <b>contractual</b> <b>intention</b> (PCI). Among the usual options to be considered are the analytical process of establishing the obligations of the parties, the incorporation of descriptions of the contractual subject matter and assertions as to its quality or performance and liability perspective. In addition, the interplay among the liability provisions and the other elements of the framework, including scope and exceptions, must be equilibrated. Principle 4 : The monitoring and review {{of the effects of the}} IPM need to incorporate necessary procedures and tools of intangible property rights protection. It is crucial to establish mechanisms that take into account the effects of Internet innovations. Such processes and tools might include technical, legislative and procedure review and might focus, among others things, on the core zones of concern outlined in the context of this dissertation with special attention on the IPM. In sum, IP and IC law might provide a helpful structure for intangible property regulation with these principles in mind. The discussion of the various options and approaches helps to determine the necessary components and infrastructure of the IPM. ...|$|E
40|$|An Introduction to the Law of Contract is {{a highly}} {{successful}} overview {{of the principles of}} contract law and how they apply in practice. This seventh edition incorporates references to the new Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) as it applies to contracts generally but with especial reference to the provisions dealing with misleading and deceptive conduct, consumer guarantees, unjust contracts, exemption clauses, harassment and coercion, the effectiveness of disclaimers and the provision of alternative remedies. Major cases included are: United Group Rail Services Ltd v Rail Corporation New South Wales and AMCI (IO) Pty Ltd v Aquila Steel Pty Ltd – agreements to negotiate in good faith; Olivaylle Pty Ltd v Flottweg AG (No 4) – the application of the postal rule in cases of emailed acceptances; PRA Electrical Pty Ltd v Perseverance Exploration Pty Ltd and Waldorf Apartment Hotel, The Entrance Pty Ltd v Owners Corp SP 71623, following the principle in Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Co in relation to contracts that arise through conduct; IATA v Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd – <b>contractual</b> <b>intention</b> and the need to give commercial contracts a businesslike interpretation; Ford v Perpetual Trustees Victoria Ltd – non est factum and the test for negligent signing; and Insight Vacations Pty Ltd v Young – strict interpretation of exemption clauses. This edition also contains more detailed discussion on how the requirement for a signed memorandum can be satisfied by a series of connected documents; how the exceptions to the parol evidence rule apply, particularly in cases of ambiguity; the basis on which rectification will be ordered; the operation of the pleas of duress, undue influence and unconscionability; the validity of restraint of trade clauses; the consequences of repudiation, and the calculation of damages.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{multiple perspectives}} on the unpopular but omnipresent terms of use (or 2 ̆ 2 ToUs 2 ̆ 2), i. e. terms and conditions contained in a link {{at the bottom of}} many websites. ToUs serve different functions: from governing the transaction taking place on a website, (e. g. contracts of sale) to the very act of browsing. Accordingly, every browsing experience has both a commercial and a legal tint. On a theoretical level ToUs raise concerns with regards to their validity as legally binding contracts as well as to their incorporation. Both formation and incorporation converge on the presence and quality of <b>contractual</b> <b>intention.</b> The latter underpins the freedom of contract - a concept frequently overlooked in endless discussions of 2 ̆ 2 click- 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 browse-wrap 2 ̆ 2 agreements.

Many traditional arguments raised 2 ̆ 2 against 2 ̆ 2 standard terms can be transposed onto online ToUs. Care must be taken not to imply that these arguments are new or unprecedented. What cannot be denied, however, is that the growing importance of ToUs online sheds new light on these 2 ̆ 2 old 2 ̆ 2 problems and forces a re-evaluation of some traditional positions in light of the technological possibility of ensuring a nearly seamless communication process: informing the website user that terms exist and ensuring their availability.

40|$|Since {{the last}} edition was {{completed}} {{at the end}} of 2004 most of the changes that have occurred in the law of contract have been clarifications of how existing principles apply in particular instances. There have also been some important cases and they, together with statutory amendments that have been made, are covered in this edition. The most important cases include the High Court, Federal Court and State court decisions, starting with Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas, that confirmed the importance of the parties' objectively determines <b>contractual</b> <b>intention</b> when deciding whether particular matters have become terms of the contract. Other significant decisions included in this edition are Khoury v Khouri and Faraday v Rappaport (confirming payment of money is not sufficient act of part performance to circumvent the Statute of Frauds' writing requirements); Mitchell v Valheire (an expanded view on when statements in advertising will be regarded as mere puff); and Koompahtoo Local Aboriginal Council v Sanpine Pty Limited (the first time the High Court has expressly accepted that the concept of intermediate terms is part of the law of Australia). Also noted in the Appendix is the first decision concerning the effect of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) - Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity 1 Pty Ltd, highlighting the seriousness with which the obligations imposed by that Act are regarded. New to the sixth edition is a section on "disgorgement damages", which, while not yet awarded in Australia, have been awarded in the United States and have been raised as possible remedy for appropriate breaches of contract in the United Kingdom. Statutory changes include the amendments to the monetary jurisdictions of the various State and Territory courts (noted in Chapter 1). Also noted are the changes to the unconscionable conduct provisions in the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and the relevant effects of the Civil Law (Property) Act 2006 (ACT). As with previous editions, this edition continues to be an overview of the relevant principles and of how they have applied (and continue to apply), in practice. For that reason, considerable emphasis continues to be placed on readily understandable explanations supported by short summaries of the cases (seminal, pivotal or just quirky), that established, clarified or illustrate the principles that form what we know as the law of contract.

40|$|The leading Australian High Court case of Cameron v Hogan (1934) 51 CLR 358 {{confirmed}} that associations which are 'social, sporting, political, scientific, religious, artistic or humanitarian in character’, and not formed ‘for private gain or material advantage’, are usually formed on {{a basis of}} mutual consent. Unless there is some clear, positive indication that the members wish to {{relate to each other}} in a legal fashion, the rules of the association will not be treated as an enforceable contract in contrast to the rules of incorporated bodies. Australian unincorporated associations experiencing internal disputes, like those in most other common law jurisdictions, have found courts reluctant to provide a remedy unless there is a proprietary interest or trust to protect. This is further compounded by the judicial view that an unincorporated association has no legal recognition as a ‘juristic person’. The right to hold property and the ability to sue and be sued are incidences of this recognition. By contrast, the law recognises ‘artificial’ legal persons such as corporations, who are given rights to hold property and to sue and be sued. However, when a number of individuals associate together for a non-commercial, lawful purpose, but not by way of a corporate structure, legal recognition ‘as a group’ is denied. Since 1934, a significant number of cases have distinguished or otherwise declined to follow this precedent of the High Court. A trenchant criticism is found in McKinnon v Grogan [1974] 1 NSWLR 295, 298 where Wootten J said that ‘citizens are entitled to look to the courts for the same assistance in resolving disputes about the conduct of sporting, political and social organisations as they can expect in relation to commercial institutions’. According to Wootten J at 298, if disputes are not settled by the courts, this would create a ‘legal-no-man's land, in which disputes are settled not in accordance with justice and the fulfilment of deliberately undertaken obligations, but by deceit, craftiness, and an arrogant disregard of rights’. Cameron v Hogan was decided in 1934. There is an increasing volume of first instance cases which distinguish or, in the words of Palmer J, ‘just pay lip service’ to this High Court decision. (Coleman v Liberal Party of Australia (2007) 212 FLR 271, 278). The dissenting cases seem to call for a judicial policy initiative. This would require recognition by judges that voluntary associations {{play a significant role in}} society and that members have a legitimate, enforceable expectation that the rules of the association will be observed by members and in the last resort, enforced by the courts without the need to prove <b>contractual</b> <b>intention,</b> the existence of a trust or the existence of a right of a proprietary nature. This thesis asks: what legal, as distinct from political, redress does an ordinary member have, when a rule is made or a process followed which is contrary to the underlying doctrines and philosophies embodied in the constitutional documents of an unincorporated religious association? When, if at all, will a court intervene to ensure doctrinal purity or to supervise the daily life of a large unincorporated religious association? My research objective is to examine and analyse leading cases and relevant legislation on the enforceability of the constitutions of large, unincorporated, religious associations with particular reference to the Anglican Church in New South Wales. Given its numerical size, wide geographical spread and presence since the foundation of New South Wales, the Anglican Church in New South Wales, contains a sufficient variety of ‘real life’ situations to be representative of the legal issues posed by Cameron v Hogan which may be faced by other large, unincorporated, religious associations in New South Wales. In contemporary society, large, unincorporated, religious associations play an important community role. The resolution of internal disputes in such associations should not remain captive to legal doctrines of an earlier age...|$|E
