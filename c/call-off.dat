60|$|A <b>call-off</b> by the {{sounding}} of a horn {{was made for}} breakfast at eight, and though Mrs. Athelny told them they had not deserved it, they ate it very heartily. They set to work again and worked till twelve, when the horn sounded once more for dinner. At intervals the measurer went his round from bin to bin, accompanied by the booker, who entered first in his own book {{and then in the}} hopper's the number of bushels picked. As each bin was filled it was measured out in bushel baskets into a huge bag called a poke; and this the measurer and the pole-puller carried off between them and put on the waggon. Athelny came back now and then with stories of how much Mrs. Heath or Mrs. Jones had picked, and he conjured his family to beat her: he was always wanting to make records, and sometimes in his enthusiasm picked steadily for an hour. His chief amusement in it, however, was that it showed the beauty of his graceful hands, of which he was excessively proud. He spent much time manicuring them. He told Philip, as he stretched out his tapering fingers, that the Spanish grandees had always slept in oiled gloves to preserve their whiteness. The hand that wrung the throat of Europe, he remarked dramatically, was as shapely and exquisite as a woman's; and he looked at his own, as he delicately picked the hops, and sighed with self-satisfaction. When he grew tired of this he rolled himself a cigarette and discoursed to Philip of art and literature. In the afternoon it grew very hot. Work did not proceed so actively and conversation halted. The incessant chatter of the morning dwindled now to desultory remarks. Tiny beads of sweat stood on Sally's upper lip, and as she worked her lips were slightly parted. She was like a rosebud bursting into flower.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{material}} requirement planning (MRP) system nervousness problem from a dynamic, stochastic and economic perspective in a two-echelon supply chain under first order auto-regressive demand. MRP nervousness is an effect where the future order forecasts, given to suppliers {{so that they may}} plan production and organize their affairs, exhibits extreme period-to-period variability. We develop a measure of nervousness that weights future forecast errors geometrically over time. Near-term forecast errors are weighted higher than distant forecast errors. Focusing on replenishment policies for high volume items, we investigate two methods of generating order <b>call-offs</b> and two methods of creating order forecasts. For order <b>call-offs,</b> we consider the traditional order-up-to (OUT) policy and the proportional OUT policy (POUT). For order forecasts, we study both minimum mean square error (MMSE) forecasts of the demand process and MMSE forecasts coupled with a procedure that accounts for the known future influence of the POUT policy. We show that when retailers use the POUT policy and account for its predictable future behavior, they can reduce the bullwhip effect, supply chain inventory costs and the manufacturer’s MRP nervousness...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{a concept}} for materials supply called <b>call-off</b> production, {{used by the}} telecom company Ericsson, where a case study was performed. <b>Call-off</b> orders are initiated from the production area and submitted through electronic data interchange (EDI) to an external supplier, a third-party logistics provider, skipping the traditional purchase ordering process. In <b>call-off</b> production Ericsson applies two forms of kanban for triggering the replenishment, namely the conventional kanban card and electronic kanban. For both variants, <b>call-off</b> production implies a short lead time, frequent deliveries, {{and the potential for}} controlling tied-up capital, using few resources, and providing a high level of delivery service. The study indicates that the conventional kanban card requires more handling than electronic kanban. On the other hand, electronic kanban could hide problems in the stock. To conduct the analysis, a theoretical framework and an analysis model were created as a foundation. <b>Call-off</b> production could be an uncomplicated and efficient method for manufacturing companies to manage some of the purchased products.

40|$|If an {{enterprise}} lacks capital {{it might be}} {{in desperate need of}} capital contribution to avoid liquidation. One solution to restore the economic balance, is to construct a contract in which the enterprise ensures that capital contribution will be made on given conditions. The purpose with this thesis is to analyze different ways to establish such agreements. A capital contribution can be triggered by a <b>call-off</b> from the board of directors to the contributor, or automatically, when the shareholders’ equity falls below 50 percent of the registered capital stock. In the literature, the latter is represented as the most adaptable. A consequence of capital contribution, that automatically triggers when shareholders’ equity falls below the critical point, is that it enables for enterprises to stay at a low economic level. This is because the automatically triggered contribution keeps the economic level just as high as necessary. Thus, the enterprise does not have to perform measures that otherwise would be required, according to the Swedish Companies Act. From that follows, that such agreements enables a possibility for the board of directors to avoid legal responsibility to set up a control balance sheet, controlled by an independent auditor. This indisputably reduces the protection for creditors, which are intended to be protected by the rules in the Swedish Companies Act. Therefore, in my opinion, such contractual terms for capital contributions should not be acceptable. When a board of directors has to trigger the contribution by a <b>call-off,</b> they are instead obliged to define the amount before the contribution can be made. Consequently, preventing inactivity within the board of directors, which must be frequently updated with the financial situation. Accordingly these terms of contract in an agreement of capital contribution, would be more in line with the regulations in the Swedish Companies Act...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Adopting best {{practice}} {{in the field of}} trackmaintenance and renewal logistics is crucial to achieving low costs for Europe’s railway; but, European practices vary considerably between infrastructure managers (IMs). This paper describes research carried out to try and establish {{the current state of the}} art for logistics, as a first step to identifying European {{best practice}}. Data on existing logistics practices were gathered using two questionnaires: oneweb-based and featuring questions, whichwere quantitative in nature, and the other covering qualitative questions, which were dealt with in face-to-face interviews. Data provided by the questionnaires suggest that the current state of the art involves centralized purchasing of components by IMs and use of <b>call-off</b> contracts for procurement. Maintenance work is predominantly carried out by in-house staff, but renewals tend to be let to contractors. Work ismainly carried out during ‘white periods ’ in the timetable,whenno trains are running; blockades are rarely used. Finally, recyclingof components is seen as important from the point-of-view of sustainability, but IMs are finding it hard to make the business case...|$|E
40|$|A well-preserved burial, {{discovered}} during peat clearing on Langwell Farm in Strath Oykel, Easter Ross, {{consisted of}} a stone cist that held the skeleton {{of a woman who}} had died in 2200 – 1960 cal BC. Although the cist contents were disturbed and partly removed before archaeological investigation took place, the burial rite can be interpreted to some extent. The woman, who died in her late 20 s, had been wrapped in brown cattle hide, and wooden and woven objects were placed with her body. Periodic waterlogging created conditions that allowed the rare, partial preservation of the organic materials. Analysis of bone histology indicated that decay of the human remains had been arrested, either by deliberate mummification or by waterlogging. The cist had been set in a low knoll on the valley floor and it may have been covered by a low cairn or barrow.

The evaluation is also a user analysis concerning how the users perceive the program, mainly in terms of usability, functionality and benefits. The result of this report shows that PIA is economically profitable to use for the purchase of goods for construction sites. It shows also that in the majority of cases take more time to place an order through PIA than by phone, but despite this, it is economically profitable to use the system. The result of the user analysis shows that the system performs what it is proposed to, despite some criticism from users.

40|$|Promoting the {{development}} of a flourishing independent sector alongside good quality public services was a key objective of the community care reforms of the last decade. This paper charts some of the ways the independent domiciliary care sector is changing, as local authorities shift the balance of their provision toward independent sector providers and away from a reliance on in-house services. Two surveys of independent domiciliary care providers were carried out in 1995 and 1999. The aims of the studies were to describe the main features of provider organisations, such as size of business, client group and funding sources; to examine the nature of provider motivations and their past and future plans; to consider how local authorities manage the supply side of social care markets; and to examine the effects on providers of {{the development}} of the mixed economy. The first survey in 1995 was conducted in eight local authority areas, which by 1999 had increased to 11 because of the creation of three new unitary authorities. The findings are based on 261 postal surveys together with 111 interviews between the two studies. The research illustrates a domiciliary care market that is still relatively young with many small but growing businesses. There are considerable differences in the split between in-house and independent sector services in individual authorities and a common perception among independent providers that in-house services receive favourable treatment and conditions. Spot or <b>call-off</b> contracts continue to be {{the most common form of}} contract although there are moves toward greater levels of guaranteed service and more sophisticated patterns of contracting arrangements. There remains an ongoing need to share information between local authorities and independent providers so that good working relationships can develop with proven and competent providers...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} potential for and cost related impact of internal lead time reduction through coordination between materials supply and a production activity of customer-order-unique products. In order to achieve the purpose two questions are answered; 1. How can with respect to sourcing strategy, coordination between materials supply and production activity of customer-order-unique products be achieved? 2. How does a coordination affect cost items in related areas of the business? Method – Based on literature in the area of materials supply a theoretical framework for the study was established. The company JELD-WEN, an industrial manufacturer with customer-order-unique-production of fire- and safety-doors was used for a case study. Data collection was performed through interviews, observations and document studies. A comparison between the theoretical framework and empirical data generated the final results. Findings – Using a hybrid sourcing strategy, changes in materials supply through an internal <b>call-off</b> together with the materials feeding method kitting proves potential to reduce the internal lead time in the manufacturing process. An economic impact of such coordination with a production activity has been found for three cost items; handling cost (increase), administrative order cost (increase/decrease) and inventory carrying cost (increase/decrease). Implications – The study does not contribute to new theory in the field. Instead existing theory and relations defined in the theoretical framework have been verified by the case study. Internal lead time reduction identified in the study may be used in other ways than by the means of an improved customer offer. This can be done through sharing time to other time-exposed activities in the manufacturing process or as an additional safety time for finished products to secure company's delivery accuracy. Therefore, in a decision situation for change affected cost items should be assessed in contrast to the more indirect value of a lead time reduction. Limitations – Modifications of materials supply occurs in a context where conditions outside the unit of analysis plays a crucial role and thereby limits the possible usage of the potential lead time reduction. The study handles impact of cost items in a general direction (increase or decrease). Absolute terms contribute to more precise consequences and are probably necessary to support a company's final financial decision of using an alternative approach in materials supply...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} have {{called into question}} the established principles of successful business management. These developments find expression in the increasing saturation of "first world" markets, where demand tends towards individualization. Reasons are a demographic shift resulting in an aging population and a fragmentation of target groups. In addition, an ongoing and deepening process of internationalization and deregulation has taken place over the past years. It has opened up new sales and supply markets, but also initiated {{a new type of}} competition at international level. From a technological point of view, the innovation cycles have steadily shortened due to new technological solutions at product and process level and in information and communication technology. Numerous expert papers on manufacturing engineering describe the trend towards a more dynamic environment, along with more customized products, using the terms "turbulence" or "environmental turbulence". A highly complex and dynamic environment makes it difficult to generate forecasts and confronts manufacturing companies with new challenges in global competition. Customers call for highly customized products with state-of-the art technology to be delivered as soon as possible, while being less and less willing to pay for it. To remain successful, companies must counteract the increasing requirements at product, price and service level. The future will only see those companies survive in the market that continue to meet the exact needs of their customers. These companies must be able, at any time, to identify new trends or spark new ones. With a lower degree of vertical integration, they need to focus on their core competencies and produce products in value chains or networks of competent, creative and innovative companies. That is why learning how to manage a network, and to think and to act in terms of a network, are essential capabilities. Many of the activities carried out by companies - often to cut down on costs - increase the significance of high-quality network management. Examples are known as "global sourcing", "outsourcing" (focus on core competencies by contracting out value-adding activities, e. g. modularization in vehicle construction), but also the ongoing reduction of stocks and the amount of capital tied-up. A greater inclusion of partners distributed across the world, as well as the reduction of safety stocks to a minimum, require a well-functioning network. To this must be added the growing market demand for short delivery times, for a more flexible handling of customer change requests and for high schedule reliability. As a result, the call for greater stability and flexibility does not only affect the network as a whole, but each individual customer-supplier interface in the network. Moreover, the number of interfaces grows with ongoing intertwining of the network. Above all, these changes require raising the quality of process synchronization in order to optimize the customer-supplier-interfaces. Several solutions have been pursued as part of supply chain management, but they do not go far enough. The following three key problems arise in industrial practice: - There are no universal indicators - resulting in a lack of visibility - which allow to measure the quality of a customer's order and <b>call-off</b> patterns. That's why this advance information is not considered appropriately, even though it has a considerable impact on the delivery performance of the supplier. - There are numerous turbulence germs in the companies that trigger fluctuations in the order and <b>call-off</b> patterns. There is a lack of methods to identify and eliminate self-induced turbulence. - Growing environmental turbulence results more often in externally driven turbulence, i. e. market- or consumer-driven turbulence. There are no appropriate approaches in science and business that enable arrangements which minimize turbulence between customer and supplier. The aim of this thesis is therefore to find concrete solutions to the three problems described above in order to contribute to the process synchronization of customer-supplier interfaces. The quality of the customer-supplier interface is a key determinant of competitiveness in a manufacturing environment where series products are manufactured at regular intervals over an extended period. Both the continuous order flow and the deliveries at short intervals provide the necessary basis for a model that allows analyzing and designing the order pattern. The model developed in this thesis is based on two key components for the analysis and design of order patterns. The first part describes a method to quantify order patterns {{so that they can be}} sorted into quality categories. A company can thus assess both its own order pattern as well as that of its customers. The outcome allows interpreting the order pattern. The interpretation determines if and how problematic the measured order pattern is for the network and if this order pattern is "logically comprehensible". The analysis model considers the four key trouble spots identified when assessing the state of the art. These four areas of action require taking into full consideration the three dimensions of order quantity, order date and delivery date, the identification of actual customer needs, the risks associated with fluctuation, and the relationship between fluctuation characteristics and possible causes of fluctuations. This interpretation provides the basis for the design part of the developed model. It recommends specific actions to eliminate self- and externally induced turbulence germs. Specific cause-and-effect relationships referring to exemplary fluctuation patterns and associated typical 'obstacles' in real life help to reduce the self-induced order fluctuations. Due to the fact that many turbulence germs are externally induced and therefore cannot be avoided, this thesis suggests how customer and supplier can handle the expected fluctuations by agreeing on fluctuation margins. The analysis of the "state of the art" revealed two major criteria: specific dependencies between products or variants in terms of flexible delivery need to be considered, and a practical approach developed for customers and suppliers to come to such an agreement. The model presented here makes an important contribution to improving collaboration at the customer-supplier interface and thus to making networks more stable. The model has been verified by an abstract data model proving that the requirements set for such a model can be satisfied. Moreover, it is also possible to apply subcomponents of the developed model in practice, for example, when working out customer-supplier agreements, which is also possible without an advance retrograde analysis of the order pattern...|$|E

Im ersten Teil wird eine Methode zur Quantifizierung von Bestellverhalten beschrieben, mit deren Hilfe das Bestellverhaltens einer Güteklasse zugeordnet wird. Ein Unternehmen kann damit sowohl sein eigenes Bestellverhalten oder das seines Kunden bewerten. Auf Basis dieser Ergebnisse wird dann das Bestellverhalten interpretiert. Diese Interpretation belegt, inwieweit das gemessene Bestellverhalten ein Problem im Netzwerk darstellt, und inwieweit dieses Bestellverhalten „logisch nachvollziehbar“ ist. Das Analysemodell berücksichtigt dabei die wesentlichen vier Handlungsbedarfe, die bei der Bewertung des Standes der Technik identifiziert wurden. Diese vier Handlungsbedarfe beziehen sich auf die ganzheitliche Berücksichtigung der drei Dimensionen Bestellmenge, Bestelltermin und Zeitpunkt der Bestellung, die Identifikation des tatsächlichen Kundenwunsches, die mit einer Schwankung verbundenen Risiken sowie den Zusammenhang zwischen Schwankungscharakteristik und möglichen Schwankungsursachen. Diese Interpretation liefert damit die Basis für den Gestaltungsteil des hier entwickelten Modells. Darin werden konkrete Handlungsempfehlungen für eigen- und fremdinduzierte Turbulenzkeime vorgeschlagen. Bei der Reduzierung eigeninduzierter Bestellschwankungen helfen konkrete Ursachen-Wirkungs-Zusammenhänge zwischen beispielhaften Schwankungsmustern und dazugehörenden typischen „Stolpersteinen“ aus der Praxis. Da sich eine Vielzahl an Turbulenzen aufgrund ihres fremdinduzierten Charakters nicht vermeiden lassen, wird dargestellt, wie Kunde und Lieferant die zu erwartenden Turbulenzen mittels Schwankungskorridoren vereinbaren können. Bei der Analyse des „Standes der Technik“ wurden zwei besonders wichtige Kriterien identifiziert: die Berücksichtigung spezifischer Abhängigkeiten zwischen Produkten oder Varianten bezüglich der Lieferflexibilität sowie eine praxisnahe Vorgehensweise für Kunde und Lieferant zur Erlangung einer derartigen Vereinbarung. Das hier vorgestellte Modell leistet einen wichtigen Beitrag zur besseren Zusammenarbeit an der Schnittstelle Kunde-Lieferant und damit zur Stabilität ganzer Netzwerke. Die Verifizierung des Modells mit einem abstrahierten Datenmodell belegt, dass die Anforderungen an ein derartiges Modell erfüllt werden können. Darüber hinaus können auch Teilelemente des entwickelten Modells in der Praxis eingesetzt werden, etwa bei der Vereinbarung einer Kunden-Lieferanten-Vereinbarung, die auch ohne vorangehende {{retrograde}} Analyse des Bestellverhaltens möglich ist. Recent {{developments have}} {{called into question}} the established principles of successful business management. These developments find expression in the increasing saturation of “first world“ markets, where demand tends towards individualization. Reasons are a demographic shift resulting in an aging population and a fragmentation of target groups. In addition, an ongoing and deepening process of internationalization and deregulation has taken place over the past years. It has opened up new sales and supply markets, but also initiated {{a new type of}} competition at international level. From a technological point of view, the innovation cycles have steadily shortened due to new technological solutions at product and process level and in information and communication technology. Numerous expert papers on manufacturing engineering describe the trend towards a more dynamic environment, along with more customized products, using the terms „turbulence“ or „environmental turbulence“. A highly complex and dynamic environment makes it difficult to generate forecasts and confronts manufacturing companies with new challenges in global competition. Customers call for highly customized products with state-of-the art technology to be delivered as soon as possible, while being less and less willing to pay for it. To remain successful, companies must counteract the increasing requirements at product, price and service level. The future will only see those companies survive in the market that continue to meet the exact needs of their customers. These companies must be able, at any time, to identify new trends or spark new ones. With a lower degree of vertical integration, they need to focus on their core competencies and produce products in value chains or networks of competent, creative and innovative companies. That is why learning how to manage a network, and to think and to act in terms of a network, are essential capabilities. Many of the activities carried out by companies - often to cut down on costs - increase the significance of high-quality network management. Examples are known as „global sourcing“, „outsourcing“ (focus on core competencies by contracting out value-adding activities, e. g. modularization in vehicle construction), but also the ongoing reduction of stocks and the amount of capital tied-up. A greater inclusion of partners distributed across the world, as well as the reduction of safety stocks to a minimum, require a well-functioning network. To this must be added the growing market demand for short delivery times, for a more flexible handling of customer change requests and for high schedule reliability. As a result, the call for greater stability and flexibility does not only affect the network as a whole, but each individual customer-supplier interface in the network. Moreover, the number of interfaces grows with ongoing intertwining of the network. Above all, these changes require raising the quality of process synchronization in order to optimize the customer-supplier-interfaces. Several solutions have been pursued as part of supply chain management, but they do not go far enough. The following three key problems arise in industrial practice: - There are no universal indicators - resulting in a lack of visibility - which allow to measure the quality of a customer’s order and <b>call-off</b> patterns. That’s why this advance information is not considered appropriately, even though it has a considerable impact on the delivery performance of the supplier. - There are numerous turbulence germs in the companies that trigger fluctuations in the order and <b>call-off</b> patterns. There is a lack of methods to identify and eliminate self-induced turbulence. - Growing environmental turbulence results more often in externally driven turbulence, i. e. market- or consumer-driven turbulence. There are no appropriate approaches in science and business that enable arrangements which minimize turbulence between customer and supplier. The aim of this thesis is therefore to find concrete solutions to the three problems described above in order to contribute to the process synchronization of customer-supplier interfaces. The quality of the customer-supplier interface is a key determinant of competitiveness in a manufacturing environment where series products are manufactured at regular intervals over an extended period. Both the continuous order flow and the deliveries at short intervals provide the necessary basis for a model that allows analyzing and designing the order pattern. The model developed in this thesis is based on two key components for the analysis and design of order patterns. The first part describes a method to quantify order patterns {{so that they can be}} sorted into quality categories. A company can thus assess both its own order pattern as well as that of its customers. The outcome allows interpreting the order pattern. The interpretation determines if and how problematic the measured order pattern is for the network and if this order pattern is „logically comprehensible“. The analysis model considers the four key trouble spots identified when assessing the state of the art. These four areas of action require taking into full consideration the three dimensions of order quantity, order date and delivery date, the identification of actual customer needs, the risks associated with fluctuation, and the relationship between fluctuation characteristics and possible causes of fluctuations. This interpretation provides the basis for the design part of the developed model. It recommends specific actions to eliminate self- and externally induced turbulence germs. Specific cause-and-effect relationships referring to exemplary fluctuation patterns and associated typical ‘obstacles’ in real life help to reduce the self-induced order fluctuations. Due to the fact that many turbulence germs are externally induced and therefore cannot be avoided, this thesis suggests how customer and supplier can handle the expected fluctuations by agreeing on fluctuation margins. The analysis of the „state of the art“ revealed two major criteria: specific dependencies between products or variants in terms of flexible delivery need to be considered, and a practical approach developed for customers and suppliers to come to such an agreement. The model presented here makes an important contribution to improving collaboration at the customer-supplier interface and thus to making networks more stable. The model has been verified by an abstract data model proving that the requirements set for such a model can be satisfied. Moreover, it is also possible to apply subcomponents of the developed model in practice, for example, when working out customer-supplier agreements, which is also possible without an advance retrograde analysis of the order pattern...|$|E
