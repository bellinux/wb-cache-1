50|$|The Tadgh MacCarthaigh GAA Club {{was founded}} in 1954. The founder members were: Sonny O’Driscoll, Corliss, Tadgh and Tim Daly, Corliss and Paddy and Sean Keohane, Clouncuggar. The first playing fields were in Sonny O’Driscoll’s and Dick Kingston’s of Corliss. The Club won its first ever West Cork Junior B Championship in 1958. Since then, their successes {{included}} Junior 2 titles in 1968 and 1975 beating Ardfield on both occasions and in 1991 when they beat Kilbrittain. The Club has had successes twice in the Under 21 B Championship, beating Timoleague in 1982 and St. <b>Colums</b> in 1990.|$|E
50|$|Two of St. <b>Colums</b> {{most famous}} {{victories}} {{were in the}} Junior B grade. In 1997, St.Colums comfortably defeated Glengariff in Bantry to win the county title and move into Junior A. In 2003, St.Colums defeated Lisgoold in Cork in a high quality close match to lift the Cork Junior Hurling Championship. 2013 was a very successful year for the club with the junior footballers defeating Caheragh to win the West Cork Final for the first time. They subsequently reached the county final but were narrowly defeated by Mitchelstown. 2013 also saw the hurlers reaching the hurling decider in Carbery losing to Dohenys. Underage success continued in 2013 with the u-16 footballers capturing a county title.|$|E

50|$|In 1922 he was {{commissioned}} to write versions of Hawaiian folklore for young people. This {{resulted in the}} publication of three volumes of his versions of tales from the islands. At the suggestion of Dr Pádraic Whyte (School of English, Trinity College Dublin) a first edition of the first volume (At the Gateways of the Day) was presented to US president Barack Obama by Taoiseach Enda Kenny {{on the occasion of}} his visit to Dublin, Ireland on 23 May 2011. Colum also started writing novels. These include Castle Conquer (1923) and The Flying Swans (1937). The <b>Colums</b> spent the years from 1930 to 1933 living in Paris and Nice, where Padraic renewed his friendship with James Joyce and became involved in the transcription of Finnegans Wake.|$|E
5000|$|MacDonagh was {{generally}} credited with {{being one of}} the most gregarious and personable of the risings leaders. Geraldine Plunkett Dillon, a sister of Joseph Plunkett gives a contemporary description of him in her book All in the Blood: [...] "As soon as Tomás came into our house everyone was a friend of his. He had a pleasant, intelligent face and was always smiling, and you had the impression that he was always thinking about what you were saying." [...] In Mary <b>Colums</b> Life and the Dream, she writes of hearing about the Rising from America, where she was living with her husband, Pádraic Colum, remembering Tomás MacDonagh saying to her: [...] "This country will be one entire slum unless we get into action, in spite of our literary movements and Gaelic Leagues it is going down and down. There is no life or heart left in the country." ...|$|E
5000|$|At 3:00 P.M., the {{soldiers}} {{on the crest of}} Missionary Ridge and at its foot watched 23,000 soldiers of the Army of the Cumberland deployed nearly two miles from the Confederates’ position. At 3:40 this force began its advance toward the ridge; Lt. Reason Jerkins of the 7th Florida, despite considering the Yankees his mortal enemies wrote, [...] "oh, what a purity sight it was to see them charge in 3 solide <b>colums</b> across the old field as blue as indigo mud and their arms glittered like new." [...] While the artillery atop Missionary Ridge opened almost immediately, {{the soldiers}} in the rifle pits {{at the base of the}} ridge waited until the enemy closed to within 300 yards and then fired. Immediately after delivering their one volley, the soldiers to the left and right of Maxwell’s advance force began retreating up the ridge; at seeing the Rebels fleeing, the Federals of the assaulting columns broke into a run toward the advanced line.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{kernel of}} scientific {{software is the}} multiplication of a sparse matrix by a vector. The efficiency of the algorithm on a vector computer depends on the storage scheme. With a storage by rows, performances are limited in general by the small vector length. Therefore a storage by so-called generalized <b>colums</b> has been designed, which provides long vectors and consequently good performances. However, it is not adapted to the symmetric case. A new type of storage, by sparse diagonals, has then been defined. It still exhibits long vectors, with performances as good as previously, {{but it is also}} well-suited to symmetric matrices. Results on a Cray 2, with various sparse matrices, compare the three algorithms, and show the efficiency of the storage by sparse diagonale...|$|E

Multidimensional liquid phase chromatography was developed utilising ion exchange chromatography using both cation and anion exchange <b>colums</b> in series in the first dimension. Alternatively, liquid isoelectric focusing protein fractionation was developed first dimension protein separation. Reversed phase liquid chromatography was eloped as a second dimension system, utilising 500 |Lim i. d capillary monoliths. Subsequently, the proteins collected from second dimension were in-solution digested using trypsin and analysed by mass spectrometry. In addition, reversed ase capillary chromatography was coupled directly to ESI-MS to determine intact molecular weights of proteins in a combined top down, bottom up proteomic approach.
