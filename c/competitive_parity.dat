25|$|Throughout this time, Bert Bell, {{co-owner}} of the Philadelphia Eagles, felt his team's lack of competitiveness on the field {{made it difficult for}} the Eagles to sell tickets and to be profitable. Compounding the Eagles' problems were players signed with teams that offered the most money, or if the money being equal, players chose to sign with the most prestigious teams at the time, who had established a winning tradition. As a result, the NFL was dominated by the Chicago Bears, Green Bay Packers, Giants, and Redskins. Bell's inability to sign a desired prospect, Stan Kostka, in 1935, eventually led Bell to believe the only way for the NFL to have enduring success was for all teams to have an equal opportunity to sign eligible players. At a league meeting on May 18, 1935, Bell proposed a draft be instituted to enhance the possibility of <b>competitive</b> <b>parity</b> on the field in order to ensure the financial viability of all franchises. His proposal was adopted unanimously that day, although the first draft would not occur until the next off-season.|$|E
25|$|The National Football League Draft, {{also called}} the Player Selection Meeting, is an annual event in which the National Football League (NFL) teams select {{eligible}} college football players. It serves as the league's most common source of player recruitment. The basic design of the draft is that each team is given {{a position in the}} drafting order in reverse order relative to its record in the previous year, which means that the last place team is positioned first. From this position, the team can either select a player or trade their position to another team for other draft positions, a player or players, or any combination thereof. The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its draft position. Certain aspects of the draft, including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft, have seen revisions since its first creation in 1936, but the fundamental methodology has remained the same. Currently the draft consists of seven rounds. The original rationale in creating the draft was to increase the <b>competitive</b> <b>parity</b> between the teams as the worst team would, ideally, have chosen the best player available.|$|E

50|$|Professor Barney's 1991 paper {{developed}} a simple framework for distinguishing among several {{different types of}} firm performance—i.e., competitive disadvantage, <b>competitive</b> <b>parity,</b> temporary competitive advantage, and sustained competitive advantage competitive advantage—and identified the attributes of resources and capabilities {{that would make them}} costly to imitate. This framework {{has come to be known}} as the VRIO (Valuable, Rare, Costly to Imitate, and exploited by Organization). Resources that do not increase a firm's revenues or decrease its costs as not valuable, and are a source of competitive disadvantage. Resources that are valuable but not rare are a source of <b>competitive</b> <b>parity.</b> Resources that are valuable and rare can be a source of temporary competitive advantage. Resources that are valuable, rare, and costly to imitate can be a source of sustained competitive advantage. Organization acts like an adjustment factor in this theory—enabling firms that should only have <b>competitive</b> <b>parity</b> to gain high level performance from their resources or leading firms with potentially higher levels of performance to lose that performance because they are poorly organized.|$|E

50|$|A firm {{can either}} exploit an {{external}} opportunity or neutralize an external threat by using its rare and valuable resources. In this case, the firm can gain competitive advantage. When the firm’s competitors discover this competitive advantage, they may respond in two ways. First, {{they can choose}} to ignore the profit gaining by the competitive advantage and continue to operate in their old ways. Second, they can choose to analyze and duplicate the competitive strategy of its rival. If there is no cost or little cost in obtaining this rare and valuable resource, the fellow firms can imitate the competitive advantage {{in order to gain}} <b>competitive</b> <b>parity</b> (firms that create the same economic value as their rivals experience <b>competitive</b> <b>parity).</b> However, sometimes it is hard for other firms to get access to the resources and imitate the innovative company’s strategy. As a result, the innovative companies that implement its strategies based on costly-to-imitate and valuable resources can gain long-term competitive advantage, which ensures a company’s sustained success (Hill & Jones, 1998). Hence, to sustain the competitive advantage, it is not sufficient for a firm's resources and capabilities to be valuable and rare - they should also be inimitable.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} several decades, {{advertising}} effects on sales have been studied without appropriately taking into consideration competitors advertising activities. As a result, advertisers often instinctively match competitors spending proportionately when it is monitored. The weakness of such a <b>competitive</b> <b>parity</b> approach is that they implicitly assume zero-sum competition only. This study identifies a variety of competitive conditions under which better budgeting strategies can be formulated. Specifically, four types of competition are conceptualized based on how an advertiser and its competitors affect each other s sales according to level of media advertising spending. In addition, appropriate strategies for setting advertising budgets to deal with each situation are discussed. A mathematical method is developed to measure advertising effectiveness for both the advertiser and competitors on sales of a focal brand. The method computes current and carryover effects, identifies in which type of competition the advertiser is operating, and, accordingly, determines which budgeting strategy best suits the situation. In an empirical illustration, the method was applied to data collected monthly over eight years. The analyzed product was Scotch whisky sold in Thailand. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we isolate a {{critical}} organizational resource – {{the general manager}} – and empirically demonstrate its linkage with value generation using a disaggregated dependent variable. In the process, we {{make a contribution to}} the literature on a number of methodological issues that have plagued empirical work in RBV: level of analysis, selection and specification of the dependent variable, controlling for industry effects and unobserved heterogeneity, and the call for longitudinal studies. The results of the study suggest that general managers with different organizations have been a potential source of <b>competitive</b> <b>parity,</b> competitive disadvantage or competitive advantage which in turn lead to normal, below normal and above normal performance, respectively. The resource-based view of the firm (RBV), while theoretically compelling, has not received empirical support for the linkage between critical resources and the generation of value (Peteraf & Barney, 2003).
