The high pH was chosen because antibodies are practically immobile at high pH. An electrophoresis equipment with a horizontal <b>cooling</b> <b>plate</b> was normally recommended for the electrophoresis.|$|E

40|$|This work used {{experimental}} methods to study heat transfer behavior inside a heat pipe {{and found that}} heat transfer behavior inside the heat pipe was changed due to its integration with <b>cooling</b> <b>plates.</b> This change caused the heat pipe to have copper-like heat transfer behavior.

40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center is {{developing}} advanced passive thermal management technology {{to reduce the}} mass and improve the reliability of space fuel cell systems for the NASA Exploration program. The passive thermal management system relies on heat conduction within highly thermally conductive <b>cooling</b> <b>plates</b> to move {{the heat from the}} central portion of the cell stack out to the edges of the fuel cell stack. Using the passive approach eliminates the need for a coolant pump and other cooling loop components within the fuel cell system which reduces mass and improves overall system reliability. Previous development demonstrated the performance of suitable highly thermally conductive <b>cooling</b> <b>plates</b> and integrated heat exchanger technology to collect the heat from the <b>cooling</b> <b>plates</b> (Ref. 1).

50|$|Two unique semiconductors, one n-type and one p-type, {{are used}} {{because they need}} to have {{different}} electron densities. The semiconductors are placed thermally in parallel to each other and electrically in series and then joined with a thermally conducting plate on each side. When a voltage is applied to the free ends of the two semiconductors there is a flow of DC current across the junction of the semiconductors causing a temperature difference. The side with the <b>cooling</b> <b>plate</b> absorbs heat which is then moved {{to the other side of}} the device where the heat sink is. Thermoelectric Coolers, also abbreviated to TECs are typically connected side by side and sandwiched between two ceramic plates. The cooling ability of the total unit is then proportional to the number of TECs in it.|$|E
50|$|A common {{method of}} {{deactivation}} when studying brain function is ablation of neural tissue, {{but there are}} several drawbacks. The exact location and extent of ablation, whether caused by chemicals or lesions, can only be defined post mortem. If the ablation occurred in an undesired location or has deactivated more of the tissue than intended, the time and resources were already been spent while obtaining results unrelated to the designed investigation. Also, ablation permanently deactivates the section of interest due to damage or removal of the neural tissue. Since the tissue cannot be reactivated, control measures that can be directly compared to the deactivation-induced effects cannot be obtained. Comparisons must be made between animals, which will have inherent differences, so internal double dissociations are not possible. Another major drawback in using ablation to deactivate tissue is that because the brain is plastic, while animals are recovering from ablation surgery, the cerebral cortex is able to modify the neural networking by activating new connections or strengthening pre-existing ones. This could cause the resulting behavior in the investigation to appear normal even though part of the animal’s brain has been deactivated, and then investigators {{would not be able}} to tell the contribution of the deactivated section to normal function. To overcome many of these drawbacks, cortical cooling devices may be used instead of ablation. While allowing a range of tissue areas to be cooled (small with cryotips to very large if using multiple cryoloops or a <b>cooling</b> <b>plate),</b> using cooling devices is a reversible method that enables control of the period of inactivation and, when turned off, takes only minutes for the animal to recover full function. These advantages hold even when deactivations are repeated over long periods of time, from months to years, with no evidence of attenuation.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 The {{need for}} clean and {{renewable}} fuel such as hydrogen {{is driven by}} a growing worldwide population and increasing air pollution from fossil fuels. One of the major barriers {{for the use of}} hydrogen in automotive industry is the storage of hydrogen. Physisorption is the most promising storage technique due to its high storage density, reversibility and rapid sorption kinetics besides being safe and volume-efficient. A major challenge for physisorption is the need to manage the heat of adsorption at cryogenic temperatures. In this thesis, a 6061 aluminum microchannel <b>cooling</b> <b>plate</b> is designed to remove the equivalent heat flux required by the adsorption of hydrogen within an adsorption bed. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to determine whether laser welding and heat treating strategies can be developed for a 6061 aluminum microchannel <b>cooling</b> <b>plate</b> {{as part of a larger}} hydrogen storage thermal management system. Key manufacturing process requirements include controlling the hermeticity, strength and dimensional stability of the heat-treated weld joint.
