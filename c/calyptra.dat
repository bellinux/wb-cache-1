25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the flowering process the only part that is visible is the fused cap of petals known as the <b>calyptra.</b> Shortly after the <b>calyptra</b> is shed, liberating the pollen from the anthers of the stamen. Wind and insects generally play only a small role in aiding pollination, with the process being mostly self-contained within the vine. But cross-pollination between vine species is possible as in the cases of the origins of several grape varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon (a cross pollination of Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc) and Petite Sirah (a cross of Syrah and Peloursin). During the process of fertilization, the pollen fertilizes the ovary which produces seeds as the flower begins the transformation into a grape berry, encapsulating the seed. Detrimental weather (cold, wind & rain) can severely affect the flowering process, causing many flowers not to be fertilized and produce a group. It is during this time when the buds that will become next years crops begin to form.|$|E

50|$|The halteres are {{club-shaped}} organs, used {{to balance}} the insect in flight, consisting of a proximal portion connected to a mechano-sensory organ. The homology between the wings and halteres is demonstrated by the four-winged mutant of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The development of the halteres varies according to the systematic group: in the Tipulidae are they are thin but long and clearly visible, but are usually hidden by the wings in most other groups. In Calyptratae which includes the most advanced Diptera, the halteres are protected by <b>calyptrae</b> (small membranes above the halteres).|$|R

5000|$|The Polytrichum genus has {{a number}} of closely related sporophytic characters. The {{scientific}} name is derived from the Ancient Greek words polys, meaning [...] "many", and thrix, meaning [...] "hair". This name was used in ancient times to refer to plants with fine, hairlike parts, including mosses, but this application specifically refers to the hairy <b>calyptras</b> found on young sporophytes. There are two major sections of Polytrichum species. The first — section Polytrichum — has narrow, toothed, and relatively erect leaf margins. The other — section Juniperifolia — has broad, entire, and sharply inflexed leaf margins that enclose the lamellae on the upper leaf surface.|$|R
40|$|In basal {{angiosperms}} (including ANITA grade, magnoliids, Choranthaceae, Ceratophyllaceae) {{almost all}} bisexual flowers are dichogamous (with {{male and female}} functions more or less separated in time), and nearly 100 per cent of those are protogynous (with female function before male function). Movements of floral parts and differential early abscission of stamens in the male phase are variously associated with protogyny. Evolution of synchronous dichogamy based on the day/night rhythm and anthesis lasting 2 days is common. In a few clades in Magnoliales and Laurales heterodichogamy has also evolved. Beetles, flies and thrips are the major pollinators, with various degrees of specialization up to large beetles and special flies in some large-flowered Nymphaeaceae, Magnoliaceae, Annonaceae and Aristolochiaceae. Unusual structural specializations are involved in floral biological adaptations (<b>calyptras,</b> inner staminodes, synandria and food bodies, and secretory structures on tepals, stamens and staminodes). Numerous specializations that are common in monocots and eudicots are absent in basal angiosperms. Several families are poorly known in their floral biology...|$|R
40|$|Grape {{clusters}} of different Vitis genotypes, including Vitis vinifera cvs Chasselas and Merlot, and two interspecific grape varieties, Solaris (cvs. Merzling* x (Saperavi severneyi x Muscat ottonel)) and 2091 (cvs. Gamaret x Bronner), are susceptible or resistant to downy mildew. These cultivars were inoculated with Plasmopara viticola at three developmental stages (BBCH stages 53, 69 and 75). Samples were examined by {{scanning electron microscopy}} and the synthesis of stilbenes was measured. Microscopical examinations of pedicels, rachis and <b>calyptras</b> showed important differences in stomatal structures within seasonal development. At BBCH 53, successful infections were observed on all tested cultivars and functional stomata were present, while no infections were observed after this stage. At BBCH 69 and 75, cracks were observed around the stomata and guard cells were unstructured or completely collapsed, leading to closed-like stomata. At BBCH 53, significant stilbene accumulation was quantified in 2091 and Solaris; pterostilbene and Î¿-viniferin were produced in large amounts. In the susceptible varieties, only piceid and resveratrol were induced. At the other two stages, the concentration of all measured stilbenes was undetectable. The critical roles of seasonal development and stilbenes in the resistance of grape clusters towards downy mildew are discussed. Â© 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|Botrytis {{bunch rot}} (BBR) of grapes {{caused by the}} fungus Botrytis cinerea, can cause yield and quality implications. This study {{investigated}} the epidemiology and management of BBR in a cool climate, specifically in the Coal River Valley and Rokeby regions of Tasmania. Field trials {{were part of a}} larger project investigating spray timing and risk factors associated with BBR. Currently there is a shift to develop and use novel methods in the study of BBR epidemiology because they have the potential to provide assessment of total infection of the disease and not just visible disease. Symptoms may not be evident until fruit ripening, even though infection may have occurred weeks or months earlier. As part of this project, a duplex qPCR technique was developed based on a previously published qPCR technique targeting the intergenic region of the B. cinerea sequence. The assay was developed specifically to use on wine grapes with the internal control targeting Vitis vinifera DNA. The assay was modified and adapted to suit laboratory equipment available and then used to detect and quantify B. cinerea DNA from total nucleic acids extracted from grape berry samples. A study, using qPCR and visual assessment, was conducted during the 2008 - 09 season to track natural infections of B. cinerea in grape berries sampled from commercial vineyards in the period pre-bunch closure until harvest. Temporal progress curves of disease severity were generated using data from two V. vinifera cultivars: Riesling and Sauvignon Blanc from different vineyards. The qPCR results confirmed that infection and colonization of the fruit occurs during the early stages of berry development, followed by a latent period. Disease expression during fruit ripening increased with time. The latent infection pathway was determined to be more important than the necrotic tissue pathway, in a small plot trial conducted in 2007 - 08. Treatments included four different spray programs with and without removal of bunch trash (decaying floral parts which include <b>calyptras</b> and aborted berries). The trial was also used to investigate use of qPCR, an ELISA QuickStix™ test and mid-infrared spectroscopy to determine B. cinerea levels in juice samples. QPCR clearly showed that the fungicides reduced B. cinerea load while the ELISA tests were able to statistically separate the treatments. Spectroscopy and visual assessments were unable to statistically separate treatment effects, but there was a positive correlation between values measured using each method. A whole-of-block experimental procedure was conducted during the 2008 - 2009 growing season to investigate spatial variation of BBR within a vineyard. Vine vigour, measured as plant cell density, was found to positively correlate with BBR severity. Disease increase was attributed to berry-to-berry spread, not that of new infections. The trial also investigated the effect of early (flowering) versus midseason (PBC) spray application and both qPCR and visual assessments demonstrated that the PBC application was more effective than the flowering application. This project clearly demonstrated that qPCR methods can complement traditional visual assessments in the quantification of BBR, and showed the usefulness for assessing management practices such as fungicide application and vineyard variation, and for determining vineyard factors that contribute to increased disease...|$|R
