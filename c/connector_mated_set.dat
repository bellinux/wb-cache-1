50|$|The {{connector}} is an insulation-displacement connector—in other words, each contact comprises a pair {{of points}} which together pierce the insulation of the ribbon cable with such precision that they make {{a connection to the}} desired conductor without harming the insulation on the neighboring wires. The center row of contacts are all connected to the common ground bus and attached to the odd numbered conductors of the cable. The top row of contacts are the even-numbered sockets of the <b>connector</b> (<b>mating</b> with the even-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to every other even-numbered conductor of the cable. The bottom row of contacts are the odd-numbered sockets of the <b>connector</b> (<b>mating</b> with the odd-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to the remaining even-numbered conductors of the cable.|$|R
50|$|Other {{non-standard}} <b>connectors</b> <b>mate</b> {{only with}} their matching connectors, and are mini-DIN connectors {{only in the}} sense of sharing the 9.5 mm plug body. These mini-DIN style plugs are not approved by the Deutsches Institut für Normung, the German standards body, and many applications could be considered proprietary.|$|R

5000|$|For {{applications}} requiring {{very low}} back-reflection, the fiber end-face is polished {{at an angle}} (the typical industry standard being 8°) to prevent light that reflects from the interface from traveling back up the fiber. Because of the angle, the reflected light does not stay in the fiber core but instead leaks out into the cladding. Angle-polished <b>connectors</b> only <b>mate</b> properly to other angle-polished <b>connectors.</b> <b>Mating</b> to a non-angle polished connector causes very high insertion loss. Generally angle-polished connectors have higher insertion loss than good quality straight physical contact ones. [...] "Ultra" [...] quality connectors may achieve comparable back reflection to an angled connector when connected, but an angled connection maintains low back reflection even when the output end of the fiber is unmated.|$|R
5000|$|The Hybrids {{resemble}} {{human beings}} inside an immersion tank {{similar to a}} Cylon rebirthing tank. The Hybrids are cyborgs, consisting of conduits and other <b>connectors</b> <b>mated</b> to biological elements. The Hybrid {{is not one of}} the [...] "thirteen models". It represents a step on the path from mechanical Centurion, to partially bio-mechanical Raider, to Hybrid, to skinjob. Hybrids are so integrated into the basestars functionality that they are, for all practical purposes, its brains.|$|R

50|$|There is no {{fundamental}} {{reason why}} a video connector with similar properties to MUSA but with 75 Ω impedance could not be devised, however this has not happened, which may suggest that market demand for such a connector is low. Often, 75 Ω BNC connectors are used, however these are not freely pluggable like MUSA connectors, due to the bayonet locking action, except for specially engineered patch panels which omit the bayonet function, just relying upon the friction of the <b>connector's</b> <b>mating</b> surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|A blind <b>mate</b> <b>connector</b> is {{differentiated}} {{from other}} types of <b>connectors</b> by the <b>mating</b> action that happens via a sliding or snapping action which can be accomplished without wrenches or other tools. [...] They have self-aligning features which allows a small misalignment when mating.|$|R
5000|$|Devices {{used for}} <b>mating</b> two <b>connectors</b> {{of the same}} gender have {{a wide variety of}} terms, {{including}} for example: [...] "gender changer", [...] "gender mender", [...] "gender bender", [...] "gender blender", [...] "sex changer", and [...] "homosexual adapter". A specific gender changer can be referred to by either the gender of its connectors, or the gender which it is designed to connect to, resulting in a thoroughly ambiguous terminology. Thus a [...] "male gender changer" [...] might have female <b>connectors</b> to <b>mate</b> two male ends, or male <b>connectors</b> to <b>mate</b> two female ends.|$|R

These fluxes are called [...] "no-clean" [...] because the residue left after the solder operation is non-conductive and won't cause electrical shorts; nevertheless they leave a plainly visible white residue that resembles diluted bird-droppings. No-clean flux residue is acceptable on all 3 classes of PCBs as defined by IPC-610 provided it does not inhibit visual inspection, access to test points, or have a wet, tacky or excessive residue that may spread onto other areas. <b>Connector</b> <b>mating</b> surfaces must also be free of flux residue. Fingerprints in no-clean residue are a class 3 defect ...|$|R

The parameters to be optimised in a LAMS <b>mating</b> <b>set</b> are reviewed {{and used in}} a genetic representation of an individual LAMS <b>mating</b> <b>set</b> which is formulated for use in an evolutionary algorithm.

50|$|Most {{optical fiber}} {{connectors}} are spring-loaded, so the fiber faces are pressed together when the <b>connectors</b> are <b>mated.</b> The resulting glass-to-glass or plastic-to-plastic contact eliminates signal losses {{that would be}} caused by an air gap between the joined fibers.|$|R

Counterclockwise rotation of screw drives bottom wedge downward and jacking ring upward, pulling pins away from <b>mating</b> <b>connector.</b> Screw in mechanism turned to produce jacking force that disengages board from <b>mating</b> <b>connector.</b> Force parallel to connector pins do not bend or brake. When disengaged, board protrudes from assembly and readily grasped by operator...|$|R

50|$|Electrical blind <b>mate</b> <b>connectors</b> provide {{power or}} signal and are {{distinguished}} from other connectors {{in that they}} do not feature a rigid mechanical retention mechanism belonging to the interface itself, such as a threaded coupling nut on an SMA connector. They are typically used in a multi-pin arrangement between racks and panels, daughtercard to backplane, or similar applications where the <b>connector</b> is not <b>mated</b> by itself, but rather by the action of inserting the entire unit or module.|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{serial port}} {{connectors}} are gendered, only allowing <b>connectors</b> to <b>mate</b> with a <b>connector</b> {{of the opposite}} gender. With D-subminiature connectors, the male connectors have protruding pins, and female connectors have corresponding round sockets. Either type of connector can be mounted on equipment or a panel; or terminate a cable.|$|R

Male contacts are sometimes referred to as leads, posts or pins, while Female contacts are universally known as sockets.|$|R
50|$|These two-pin {{connectors}} {{were not}} polarized, {{and thus the}} line and neutral conductors could be exchanged depending on which way the <b>connectors</b> were <b>mated.</b> Two-pin <b>connectors</b> may still be found on some equipment and are often saved by electricians for wiring ungrounded fixtures (particularly practicals), though {{this may not be}} advisable from a safety standpoint.|$|R

Similar connectors with an incompatible 16mm diameter, 1mm metric thread have been produced, {{but these are}} not standard UHF connectors by definition.|$|R
5000|$|IEC 60320-3: Standard {{sheets and}} gauges. [...] This part {{includes}} the standard sheets for both appliance couplers and interconnection couplers. For appliance couplers the various coupler outlines are designated {{using a combination}} of letters and numbers, e.g., [...] "C14". The female part connector supplies power to the male appliance inlet. The male part is designated by the even number one greater than the number assigned to the female part, so a C1 <b>connector</b> <b>mates</b> with a C2 inlet, and a C15A mates with a C16A. Interconnection couplers have single letter designators, e.g., [...] "F". They consist of two parts: a plug connector, which is the part integral with, or intended to be attached to, the cord, and an appliance outlet, which is the part integrated or incorporated in the appliance or equipment or intended to be fixed to it, and from which the supply is obtained.|$|R

50|$|The J1772 {{standard}} {{includes several}} levels of shock protection, ensuring {{the safety of}} charging even in wet conditions.
