The inclusion of low-energy electrons results in relatively more heating in the corona (vs. chromosphere), a larger downward conductive flux, and thus a stronger chromospheric evaporation than obtained in previous studies, which had a deficit in low-energy electrons due to an arbitrarily assumed low-energy cutoff. The energy and spatial distributions of energetic electrons and bremsstrahlung photons bear signatures of the changing density distribution caused by chromospheric evaporation.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{establish}} fundamental limitations {{to the benefit}} <b>of</b> network <b>coding</b> in terms <b>of</b> energy and throughput in multihop wireless networks. Thereby we adopt two well accepted scenarios in the field: single multicast session and multiple unicast sessions. Most of our results apply to arbitrary wireless network and are, in particular, not asymptotic in kind. In terms of throughput and energy saving we prove that the gain <b>of</b> network <b>coding</b> <b>of</b> a single multicast session is at most a constant factor. Also, we present a lower bound on the expected number of transmissions of multiple unicast sessions under an arbitrary network coding. We identify scenarios for which the network coding gain for energy saving becomes surprisingly close to 1, in some cases even exactly 1, corresponding to no benefit at all. Interestingly, we prove that the gain <b>of</b> network <b>coding</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> capacity is bounded by a constant factor π in any arbitrary wireless network and for all traditional channel models. This shows that the traditional bounds on the transport capacity [1]–[4] do not change more than constant factor π if we employ network coding. As a corollary, {{we find that the}} gain <b>of</b> network <b>coding</b> on the throughput of large scale homogeneous wireless networks is asymptotically bounded by a constant. Note that our result is more general than the previous work [5] and it is obtained by a different technique.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the dual graph technique developed by the authors to represent transport networks. The method is intended to simplify the <b>coding</b> <b>of</b> complex <b>transport</b> networks to a considerable degree, particularly when there are turning restrictions, or when multiple transfers between modes or transit lines must be taken into account. A first section presents the traditional form in which transport networks are analytically represented, and describes the main problems that are confronted. In particular, the difficulty to represent prohibited turns is shown to be a major problem; when such a restriction is introduced, the representation of the network becomes increasingly complex and intractable, requiring a large number of fictitious links and nodes. A second section describes the dual graph technique in general terms, and shows how the network code remains simple, even if prohibited turns are introduced, completely avoiding fictitious links and the possibility of errors. A third section describes the way in which dual networks are constructed in formal terms. It is shown that the process of constructing the dual graph can be automated easily, becoming completely transparent to the model user. In a fourth section the method is extended to represent transit routes or, in general, multiple operators and modes. This is achieved by introducing further dimension to the dual network (multidimensional networks); the dual of very complex transit networks can also be automated, avoiding the need for fictitious nodes and links to represent transfer points. A final section draws the main conclusions and points out that dual graphs can be very useful for detailed traffic models. Brief references are made to other known methods to represent turn restrictions. ...|$|R

40|$|Context: Hard X-rays from solar flares are an {{important}} diagnostic of particle acceleration and transport in the solar atmosphere. Any observed X-ray flux from on-disc sources is composed of direct emission plus Compton backscattered photons (albedo). This affects both the observed spectra and images {{as well as the}} physical quantities derived from them such as the spatial and spectral distributions of accelerated electrons or characteristics of the solar atmosphere. Aims: We propose a new indirect method to measure albedo and to infer the directivity of X-rays in imaging using RHESSI data. Methods: Visibility forward fitting is used to determine the size of a disc event observed by RHESSI as a function of energy. This is compared to the sizes of simulated sources from a Monte Carlo simulation <b>code</b> <b>of</b> photon <b>transport</b> in the chromosphere for different degrees of downward directivity and true source sizes to find limits on the true source size and the directivity. Results: The observed full width half maximum of the source varies in size between 7. 4 arcsec and 9. 1 arcsec with the maximum between 30 and 40 keV. Such behaviour is expected in the presence of albedo and is found in the simulations. A source size smaller than 6 arcsec is improbable for modest directivities and the true source size is likely to be around 7 arcsec for small directivities. Conclusions: While it is difficult to image the albedo patch directly, the effect of backscattered photons on the observed source size can be estimated. The increase in source size caused by albedo has to be accounted for when computing physical quantities that include the size as a parameter such as flare energetics. At the same time, the study of the albedo signature provides vital information about the directivity of X-rays and related electrons. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, A&A (accepted...|$|R
