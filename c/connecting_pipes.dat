40|$|In this paper, the {{domestic}} {{solar water heater}} with a vertical storage tank and a flat-plate collector, which is commercially available and popular in the market, was experimentally investigated. Firstly, natural circulation experiment platform of flat plate domestic solar water heater was set up. The effect of two different positions of upper <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe</b> on temperature variation in the water tank during the heating stage in the daytime and thermal performances was measured. Through the analysis of test data, the difference of temperature stratification in the water tank with upper <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe</b> at high position and at low position were studied respectively. Also the instantaneous efficiency in 10 minutes was defined and compared. The results showed that there was better temperature stratification in the water tank when it's upper <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe</b> at high position during heating stage.

After fitting, it is allowed to rewarm, when the memory effect causes the sleeve to shrink back to its original smaller size, creating a tight joint.|$|E

5000|$|In modern synchrotrons, {{the beam}} {{aperture}} {{is small and}} the magnetic field does not cover the entire area of the particle orbit as it does for a cyclotron, so several necessary functions can be separated.

The focusing of the beam is handled independently by specialized quadrupole magnets, while the acceleration itself is accomplished in separate RF sections, rather similar to short linear accelerators. Also, there is no necessity that cyclic machines be circular, but rather the beam pipe may have straight sections between magnets where beams may collide, be cooled, etc. This has developed into an entire separate subject, called [...] "beam physics" [...] or [...] "beam optics".|$|E

No other manufacturer was offering dual front disc brakes at this time, {{so this was}} quite a marketing coup for Suzuki. The following year the GT750L gained unitized/rack mounted 40 mm Mikuni CV type carburetors, a gear position indicator added to the instrumentation and redesigned side covers along with other detail changes. The connecting pipe between the exhausts was removed and the exhausts redesigned to improve road clearance. The engine was also re-tuned {{with an increase in}} power to 70 bhp for the Japanese domestic market starting in January, 1974. The rest of the world received these changes with the introduction of the 1975 Suzuki GT750M with the new silencers without <b>connecting</b> <b>pipes,</b> raised gearing and power output increased by 3 bhp, now giving a top speed of 120 mph.

40|$|Abstract: The two-reservoir {{problem with}} through flow {{is a common}} feature in {{wastewater}} treatment plants. The start of the through flow may cause water surface oscillations in the reservoirs and velocity variations in the <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe</b> during the initial unsteady phase that may adversely affect the operation and under certain conditions may cause overtopping of the upstream reservoir. The classical solution based on the rigid mass theory is inapplicable as velocity variations within the pipe system are ignored. One-dimensional mass and momentum conservation equations, based on the elastic theory, with {{a new set of}} boundary conditions are solved using the method of characteristics to investigate the water surface oscillations in the two reservoirs and minimum velocity in the <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe</b> {{as a result of the}} start of a through flow. The impact of a constant or variable friction factor on the velocity and water surface oscillations in the <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe</b> is found to be negligible. The magnitude and the time it takes to establish the through flow are found to be important parameters for the system. Optimum time of linear increase of a given inflow rate to the final steady state discharge is investigated for an actual facility. A ramp time of 40 seconds is found to reduce the maximum water surface level from 40 cm to 9. 4 cm and increase the minimum velocity in the system to 85 % of the final steady state velocity...|$|R

For study effects of pipe connections, all time domain parameters (maximum amplitude, power, RMS amplitude) of signals were observed and processed with the aid of Matlab software.

The results showed that the difference between the AE parameters of high-flow pressure and low flow pressure is not much different. From this relationship, it may not conclude that the pipe connecting is the main factor to the difference in acoustic emission technique effects...|$|E

40|$|A {{modified}} version of the KIVA-II code was used to obtain a multidimensional numerical solution for the turbulent two-phase chemically reacting flows inside a staged turbine combustor (STC).

Preliminary data characterize the major features of the flow and temperature fields inside the STC. Information on velocity, temperature, and some critical species in the FN/RB zone is presented. In the QQ/LC zones, formation of the co- and counter-rotating bulk flow and the sandwiched-ring-shaped temperature field can be clearly seen. The calculations of the mass-weighted standard deviation and the pattern factor of temperature indicated that the mixing performance of the STC is very promising...|$|R
