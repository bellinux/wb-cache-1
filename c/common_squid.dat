5000|$|The TES is voltage-biased {{by driving}} a current source Ibias through a load {{resistor}} RL (see figure). The voltage is chosen {{to put the}} TES in its so-called [...] "self-biased region" [...] where the power dissipated in the device is constant with the applied voltage. When a photon is absorbed by the TES, this extra power is removed by negative electrothermal feedback: the TES resistance increases, causing a drop in TES current; the Joule power in turn drops, cooling the device back to its equilibrium state in the self-biased region. In a <b>common</b> <b>SQUID</b> readout system, the TES is operated in series with the input coil L which is inductively coupled to a SQUID series-array. Thus a change in TES current manifests as {{a change in the}} input flux to the SQUID, whose output is further amplified and read by room-temperature electronics.|$|E

In this paper we introduce short quasi-unique ID's (squids), a simple hardware mechanism for capability architectures that mitigates the problems associated with aliasing. In the <b>common</b> case, <b>squids</b> can be used to prove that there is no aliasing and therefore avoid any overhead. The probability of having to perform expensive dereferencing operations to check for aliasing when comparing pointers to different objects is exponentially small in the number of bits used to implement squids.

40|$|This study aim at {{providing}} an academic {{point of view}} on the possibilities of applying forward trading to fishery catch commodities in PIH Mina Ayu, Indramayu. This study was done based on secondary data of varieties of fishery commodities on the level of fish auctions in the Indramayu area and on the level of the Central Market in Caringin, Bandung. Gathered data were analyzed using the portofolio mean variance model (Markowitz model) to determine five commodity types with the largest rate of return and the optimal portofolio combination. Using the Winter’s Method time series analysis, forecasting of production, availability and price were conducted on the commodities determined by the previous analysis. The result of the time series analysis becomes the basic information for PIH Mina Ayu Indramayu to produce sales order for the agro-commodity auction in West Java. The five commodities with the highest rate of return were: Eastern little tuna (Euthynus spp), Indo-pacific king mackerell (Scomberomorus guttatus), Black promfet (Formio niger), <b>Common</b> <b>squids</b> (Loligo spp) and Indian mackerell (Restrelliger spp) with an optimal portofolio combination of 99. 4 % return and 25. 7 % risk. Forecasting of production and price suggest that PIH Mina Ayu can feasibly apply the forward trading method due to adequate availability of raw materials, which is needed in a relatively small amount in regards to the capacity of cold storage facility available in PIH Mina Ayu Indramayu. Forecasting of the price of commodities in the Central Market in Caringin Bandung suggest a significant margin of price, which shows a potential profit for PIH Mina Ayu Indramayu.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} dorsal aorta of three cephalopod mollusks, Nautilus pompilius, Nototodarus sloani, and Sepia latimanus, were investigated by in vitro inflations of isolated arterial segments. As expected, all three arteries exhibit nonlinear, J -shaped stress-extension curves, and all are highly extensible in the circumferential direction. Differences in longitudinal extensibility appear to be correlated to specific features of the tissue architecture. The squid, Nototodarus, {{and to a lesser}} extent the cuttlefish, Sepia, arteries are reinforced longitudinally with a dense layer of longitudinally oriented elastic fibers. Analysis of the form of the incremental wall stiffness data for Nautilus and Nototodarus suggests that the in vivo blood pressures for these animals fall in the ranges 20 - 60 cm H 20 and 100 - 200 cm H 20, respectively. Nautilus has a thinwalled, low-pressure arterial system that is in keeping with its relatively limited locomotory capabilities. Nototodarus has a high-pressure, thick-walled circulation that is required to support the high-speed, aerobic locomotion generally <b>common</b> in <b>squid.</b> Analysis of pressure wave velocities for these arteries indicates that the Nautilus circulatory system contains a true Windkessel whereas it appears possible that wave propogation effects may make a relatively minor contribution to the hemodynamics of Nototodarus...|$|R

5000|$|The family Cranchiidae {{comprises}} the approximately 60 species of glass squid, {{also known as}} cockatoo squid, cranchiid, cranch squid, or bathyscaphoid squid. Cranchiid squid occur in surface and midwater depths of open oceans around the world. They range in mantle length from 10 cm to over 3 m, {{in the case of}} the colossal <b>squid.</b> The <b>common</b> name, glass <b>squid,</b> derives from the transparent nature of most species. Cranchiid squid spend much of their lives in partially sunlit shallow waters, where their transparency provides camouflage. They are characterised by a swollen body and short arms, which bear two rows of suckers or hooks. The third arm pair is often enlarged. Many species are bioluminescent organisms and possess light organs on the undersides of their eyes, used to cancel their shadows. Eye morphology varies widely, ranging from large and circular to telescopic and stalked. A large, fluid-filled chamber containing ammonia solution is used to aid buoyancy. This buoyancy system is unique to the family and is the source of their common name [...] "bathyscaphoid squid", after their resemblance to a bathyscaphe. Often the only organ that is visible through the transparent tissues is a cigar-shaped digestive gland, which is the cephalopod equivalent of a mammalian liver. This is usually held in a vertical position to reduce its silhouette and a light organ is sometimes present on the lower tip to further minimise its appearance in the water.|$|R

40|$|Cephalopods provide forage to a {{wide range}} of predators in marine food-webs. Despite their {{ecological}} importance, a basic understanding of the mechanisms controlling predation risk and demand is lacking. This is true of one of the most <b>common</b> species of <b>squid</b> found in the northwest Atlantic, the longfin inshore squid (Loligo pealeii). In this dissertation, I address this shortcoming by investigating the role that size and behavior play in influencing squid’s vulnerability to predation. ^ I used long-term food habits, population survey, and commercial landings data, to quantify size-based patterns of predation respective to 25 species of predators. Additionally, I estimated the amount of overlap between predatory consumption and the fishery catch for squid by size. I found that finfish and elasmobranchs generally consumed juvenile and sub-adult squid, while marine mammals primarily targeted adults. Consequently, marine mammals had the highest overlap with the fishing industry for squid size resources. Although large <b>squid</b> were not <b>common</b> in predator diets, predators did not appear to be gape-limited when feeding on squid. This suggested that other factors, including behavior, were important in shaping size-based patterns of predation. ^ I used a laboratory-based approach to quantify attack and capture behaviors towards squid by two predators representing contrasting foraging tactics. Bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) and summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) were chosen as cruising and ambush predators, respectively. Patterns in attack rates suggested that size-selection on squid was constrained by passive processes rather than active choice in both predators. Size-dependent profitability functions were calculated by combining capture success rates, handling times, and relative prey mass, and determined that bluefish was the more efficient predator of squid. Lastly, I evaluated the occurrence and effectiveness of anti-predator responses used by squid in the presence of bluefish and flounder. Squid behavior depended on the type of predator present, and the survival value of primary and secondary defense behaviors differed during interactions with each predator. ^ The results of this project are intended to improve the quality of management of squid and their predators by providing a better understanding of predator-prey interactions in the northwest Atlantic. ...|$|R
