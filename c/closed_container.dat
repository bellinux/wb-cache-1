5|$|In {{the late}} 17thcentury, Robert Boyle proved that air is {{necessary}} for combustion. English chemist John Mayow (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires {{only a part of}} air that he called spiritus nitroaereus. In one experiment, he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a <b>closed</b> <b>container</b> over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.|$|E
5|$|Sweltering / Yellowing: Unique {{to yellow}} teas, warm and damp tea leaves from after kill-green {{are allowed to}} be lightly heated in a <b>closed</b> <b>container,</b> which causes the {{previously}} green leaves to turn yellow. The resulting leaves produce a beverage that has a distinctive yellowish-green hue due to transformations of the leaf chlorophyll. Through being sweltered for 6–8 hours at close to human body temperatures, the amino acids and polyphenols in the processed tea leaves undergo chemical changes to give this tea its distinct briskness and mellow taste.|$|E

There was no effect of one week tritium exposure on the glass transition temperature, Tg, of the samples tested.

5|$|Thulium is principally {{extracted}} from monazite ores (~0.007% thulium) found in river sands, through ion-exchange. Newer ion-exchange and solvent-extraction techniques {{have led to}} easier separation of the rare earths, which has yielded much lower costs for thulium production. The principal sources today are the ion adsorption clays of southern China. In these, where {{about two-thirds of the}} total rare-earth content is yttrium, thulium is about 0.5% (or about tied with lutetium for rarity). The metal can be isolated through reduction of its oxide with lanthanum metal or by calcium reduction in a <b>closed</b> <b>container.</b> None of thulium's natural compounds are commercially important. Approximately 50 tonnes per year of thulium oxide are produced. In 1996, thulium oxide cost US$20 per gram, and in 2005, 99%-pure thulium metal powder cost US$70 per gram.|$|E
5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a <b>closed</b> <b>container</b> with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of vitamins A, C, and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{carbonic}} maceration {{is also known}} as whole grape fermentation where instead of yeast being added, the grapes fermentation is encouraged to take place inside the individual grape berries.

25|$|Involuntary {{movements}} {{may make}} feeding difficult or messy and may excessively prolong mealtimes. It {{may be easier}} to finger feed than use utensils (e.g., spoon or fork).

Caregivers may need to provide foods or liquids so that self-feeding is possible, or they may need to feed the person with A-T. In general, meals should be completed within approximately 30 minutes.

25|$|Similar {{considerations}} apply {{whenever the}} energy level spacing {{is much larger}} than the thermal energy. For example, this reasoning was used by Max Planck and Albert Einstein to resolve the ultraviolet catastrophe of blackbody radiation. The paradox arises because there are an infinite number of independent modes of the electromagnetic field in a <b>closed</b> <b>container,</b> each of which may be treated as a harmonic oscillator. If each electromagnetic mode were to have an average energy kBT, there would be an infinite amount of energy in the container. However, by the reasoning above, the average energy in the higher-frequency modes goes to zero as ν goes to infinity; moreover, Planck's law of black body radiation, which describes the experimental distribution of energy in the modes, follows from the same reasoning.|$|E

40|$|Plants {{grown in}} {{microgravity}} {{are subject to}} many environmental stresses that may promote microbial growth and result in disease symptoms. Wheat (cv. Super Dwarf) recovered from an 8 -day mission aboard a NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) space shuttle showed disease symptoms, including girdling of leaf sheaths and chlorosis and necrosis of leaf and root tissues. A Neotyphodium species was isolated from the seed and leaf sheaths of symptomatic wheat used in the spaceflight mission. Certain isozymes of a peroxidase unique to extracts from the microgravity-grown plants were observed in extracts from earth-grown Neotyphodium-infected plants but were not present in noninfected wheat. The endophytic fungus was eliminated from the wheat seed by prolonged heat treatment at 50 degrees C followed by washes with water at 50 degrees C. Plants from wheat seed infected with the Neotyphodium endophyte were symptomless when grown under greenhouse conditions, whereas symptoms appeared after only 4 days of growth in <b>closed</b> <b>containers.</b> Disease spread from an infected plant to noninfected plants in <b>closed</b> <b>containers.</b> Dispersion via spores was found on asymptomatic plants at distances of 7 to 18 cm from infected plants.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the effect of switching from an open (glass or semi-rigid plastic) infusion <b>container</b> to a <b>closed,</b> fully collapsible plastic infusion container (Viaflex®) on rate and time to onset of central lineassociated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). An open-label, prospective cohort, active healthcare-associated infection surveillance, sequential study was conducted in three intensive care units in Brazil. The CLABSI rate using open infusion containers was compared to the rate using a <b>closed</b> infusion <b>container.</b> Probability of acquiring CLABSI was assessed over time and compared between open and <b>closed</b> infusion <b>container</b> periods; three-day intervals were examined. A total of 1125 adult ICU patients were enrolled. CLABSI rate was significantly higher during the open compared with the <b>closed</b> infusion <b>container</b> period (6. 5 versus 3. 2 CLABSI/ 1000 CL days; RR= 0. 49, 95 %CI= 0. 26 - 0. 95, p= 0. 031). During the <b>closed</b> infusion <b>container</b> period, the probability of acquiring a CLABSI remained relatively constant along the time of central line use (0. 8 % Days 2 - 4 to 0. 7 % Days 11 - 13) but increased in the open infusion container period (1. 5 % Days 2 - 4 to 2. 3 % Days 11 - 13). Combined across all time intervals, the chance of a patient acquiring a CLABSI was significantly lower (55 %) in the <b>closed</b> infusion <b>container</b> period (Cox proportional hazard ratio 0. 45, p= 0. 019). CLABSIs can be reduced with the use of full barrier precautions, education, and performance feedback. Our results show that switching from an open to a <b>closed</b> infusion <b>container</b> may further reduce CLABSI rate as well as delay the onset of CLABSIs. <b>Closed</b> infusion <b>containers</b> significantly reduced CLABSI rate and the probability of acquiring CLABSI...|$|R
500|$|In one experiment, Lavoisier {{observed}} {{that there was}} no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a <b>closed</b> <b>container.</b> He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container, which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed.

This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book Sur la combustion en général, which was published in 1777. In that work, he proved that air is a mixture of two gases; 'vital air', which is essential to combustion and respiration, and azote (Gk. [...] "lifeless"), which did not support either. Azote later became nitrogen in English, although it has kept the earlier name in French and several other European languages.|$|E
