As a <b>coffee</b> <b>additive,</b> it is also mixed in Indian filter coffee, and in parts of Southeast Asia, South Africa, and southern United States, particularly in New Orleans.

40|$|Instant coffee mixes {{that contain}} sugar and non-dairy creamer account for 80 – 90 % {{of the total}} coffee market in Korea. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between coffee consumption and obesity in Korean women. We included 5995 women who participated in a health screening examination at the Korean National Cancer Center between 2007 and 2016. Daily coffee consumption and the use of sugar and creamer in coffee was evaluated using a 106 -item food frequency questionnaire. Obesity was assessed by body mass index (BMI), and abdominal obesity was assessed by waist circumference (WC). A multiple logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of obesity according to coffee consumption. After multivariate adjustment, high coffee consumption was positively associated with obesity as measured by BMI (≥ 3 cups vs. no drinks, OR = 2. 52; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 91 – 3. 34; p for the trend < 0. 001) and abdominal obesity as measured by WC (≥ 3 cups vs. no drinks, OR = 2. 11; 95 % CI = 1. 59 – 2. 79; p for the trend < 0. 001). The positive association between daily coffee consumption and obesity prevalence was not altered by menopause. The amount of <b>coffee</b> with <b>additives</b> consumed per day by Korean women was positively correlated with the prevalence of obesity, but causation cannot be determined due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design. The mechanism underlying the observed relationship is yet to be elucidated...|$|R
40|$|Background: Consumption of coffee, one of {{the most}} popular {{beverages}} around the world, has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in population-based studies. However, little is known about these associations in patient populations.   Objective: This prospective study aimed to examine the consumption of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee in relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality, and all-cause mortality in patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI).   Design: We included 4365 Dutch patients from the Alpha Omega Cohort who were aged 60 – 80 y (21 % female) and had experienced an MI, 10 y before study enrollment. At baseline (2002 – 2006), dietary data including coffee consumption over the past month was collected with a 203 -item validated food-frequency questionnaire. Causes of death were monitored until 1 January 2013. HRs for mortality in categories of coffee consumption were obtained from multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for lifestyle and dietary factors.   Results: Most patients (96 %) drank coffee, and the median total coffee intake was 375 mL/d (w 3 cups/d). During a median followup of 7. 1 y, a total of 945 deaths occurred, including 396 CVDrelated and 266 IHD-related deaths. Coffee consumption was inversely associated with CVD mortality, with HRs of 0. 69 (95 % CI: 0. 54, 0. 89) for. 2 – 4 cups/d and 0. 72 (0. 55, 0. 95) for. 4 cups/d, compared with 0 – 2 cups/d. Corresponding HRs were 0. 77 (95 % CI: 0. 57, 1. 05) and 0. 68 (95 % CI: 0. 48, 0. 95) for IHD mortality and 0. 84 (95 % CI: 0. 71, 1. 00) and 0. 82 (95 % CI: 0. 68, 0. 98) for all-cause mortality, respectively. Similar associations were found for decaffeinated coffee and for <b>coffee</b> with <b>additives.</b>   Conclusion: Drinking coffee, either caffeinated or decaffeinated, may lower the risk of CVD and IHD mortality in patients with a prior MI...|$|R

The plant was introduced to more than 52 countries, from this ‘centre of origin’. ” Instant coffee is a beverage prepared by various processes in which again it is dehydrated into the form of powder or granules. These can be rehydrated with hot water to provide a drink similar (though not identical) to conventional coffee. Chicory, used as a <b>coffee</b> substitute and <b>additive</b> with other adulterants like sugar beet and mustard seeds used as an ingredient of the mixed coffee, introduced during the coffee crisis happened in 1976 - 79. According to traditional folklore, long-term use of chicory as a coffee substitute may damage human retinal tissue, with dimming of vision over time and other long term effects. Similarly, copper salts are being used commonly as an eradicant and protectant against a fungus. Therefore there is an urgent need of detecting the copper bioconcentration in the samples, hence present problem has been sorted out and {{it was found that}} no absorption or the uptake of the salt by the plant and ultimate crop or its allied product is safe for human consumption...|$|R
40|$|Size {{reduction}} applied on Arabica Coffee bean {{may change}} its physical properties, where these properties are utilized for designing process including packaging and appliances for further processes. This research aims to investigate physical characteristics of Arabica coffee powder with addition {{of corn and}} rice milled through mechanical process. This experiment used two mechanical mills including hammer mill and disc mill. Before it is milled, coffee was mixed with other materials including corn and rice. Parameters observed were yield, moisture content, bulk density, and angle of respose, particle uniformity index, fineness modulus, and the average particle dimensions. Based on the results obtained, {{it was revealed that}} moisture content of each test still meet SNI standard with the maximum of 7 %. Bulk density of coffee powder resulted using disc mill was higher compared with hammer mill. However, particle generated from milling process may be categorized as powder with medium cohesiveness based on its angle of repose. Dimensional average particle is proportional to the fineness modulus of coffee powder produced. Highest fineness modulus obtained from <b>coffee</b> powder without <b>additives,</b> and using a hammer mill is equal to 4. 37 with the highest average dimensions of 2. 05 mm, while the lowest fineness modulus that the coffee powder without any additional ingredients milled with a hammer mill is equal to 4. 22, with the lowest average dimensions of 1. 94 mm...|$|R
5000|$|The {{essential}} {{propylene glycol}} and/or glycerin mixture may consist of natural or artificial substances {{to provide it}} flavor. The cytotoxicity of e-liquids varies, and contamination with various chemicals have been detected in the liquid. Some liquids were very toxic and others {{had little or no}} cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity is mostly due to the amount and number of flavors added. Since nicotine has a bitter taste, nicotine e-liquids contain chemicals to cover up the nicotine taste. The liquids contain aromatic substances like tobacco, fruit, vanilla, caramel and <b>coffee.</b> Generally, these <b>additives</b> are imprecisely described, using terms such as [...] "vegetable flavoring". Although they are approved for human consumption there are no studies on the short-term or long-term effects of inhaling them. The safety of inhaling flavors is mostly unknown, and their safety has not been determined by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association. In some cases e-liquids contain very large amounts of flavorings, which may cause irritation and inflammation on respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Some flavors are regarded as toxic and a number of them resemble known carcinogens. Some artificial flavors are known to be cytotoxic. Unflavored vapor is less cytotoxic than flavored vapor. A 2012 study demonstrated that in embryonic and adult cellular models, some substances of the vapor such as flavoring not found in tobacco smoke were cytotoxic.|$|R
