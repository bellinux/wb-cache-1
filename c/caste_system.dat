5|$|The Hindu <b>caste</b> <b>system</b> {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in the ancient Hindu scriptures like the Vedas and the Upanishads. Various sub-classifications of the <b>caste</b> <b>system</b> exist, many based on the geographical origin of the caste.|$|E

5|$|Most {{information}} on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The Hindu <b>caste</b> <b>system</b> was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set {{the rules and regulations}} that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. Untouchability was part of the <b>caste</b> <b>system</b> and these communities were represented by leaders (Kaivadadavaru). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The <b>caste</b> <b>system</b> did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the <b>caste</b> <b>system,</b> Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect. With {{the exception of a few}} who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as Molla and Kanakadasa) and their works (including those of Vemana and Sarvajna) is an indication of the degree of social fluidity in the society.|$|E

5|$|Periyar {{felt that}} {{a small number of}} cunning people created caste distinctions to {{dominate}} over society, so he emphasised that individuals must first develop self-respect and learn to analyse propositions rationally. According to Periyar, a self-respecting rationalist would readily realise that <b>caste</b> <b>system</b> had been stifling self-respect and therefore he or she would strive {{to get rid of this}} menace.|$|E
5|$|Raja Shivaji {{and most}} of the Maratha warriors belonged to the Maratha caste of the four-tier Hindu <b>caste</b> <b>system,</b> whereas all of the Peshwas belonged to the Brahmin caste. After Raja Shivaji's death, the Peshwas {{gradually}} became the effective rulers {{of the state and the}} Hindu Brahmin Maratha king was merely a puppet of Peshwa.|$|E

5|$|After Indonesia's independence, Andjar {{moved to}} Purwokerto {{to lead the}} daily Perdjoeangan Rakjat. After the paper collapsed, he {{returned}} to film, film a piece entitled Djaoeh Dimata for the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration in 1948. This was followed by two additional films, Anggrek Bulan (Moon Orchid; 1948) and Gadis Desa (Maiden from the Village; 1949), both based on plays he wrote several years earlier. In 1950, Andjar published his only novel, Noesa Penida, {{a critique of the}} Balinese <b>caste</b> <b>system,</b> which followed lovers from different levels of the social hierarchy. Meanwhile, he continued to write and publish paperback serials adapted from local films.|$|E
5|$|Although lynchings and racially {{motivated}} murders {{had occurred}} throughout the South for decades, {{the circumstances surrounding}} Emmett Till's murder and the timing acted as a catalyst to attract national attention {{to the case of}} a 14-year-old boy who had allegedly been killed for breaching a social <b>caste</b> <b>system.</b> Till's murder aroused feelings about segregation, law enforcement, relations between the North and South, the social status quo in Mississippi, the activities of the NAACP and the White Citizens' Councils, and the Cold War, all of which were played out in a drama staged in newspapers all over the U.S. and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{stated that}} the <b>caste</b> <b>system</b> in south India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked {{with the arrival of}} Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a {{different}} stratification of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living. Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high and low in their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.|$|E
50|$|Various sociologists have {{reported}} <b>caste</b> <b>systems</b> in Africa. The {{specifics of the}} <b>caste</b> <b>systems</b> have varied in ethnically and culturally diverse Africa, however the following features are common - {{it has been a}} closed system of social stratification, the social status is inherited, the castes are hierarchical, certain castes are shunned while others are merely endogamous and exclusionary. In some cases, concepts of purity and impurity by birth have been prevalent in Africa. In other cases, such as the Nupe of Nigeria, the Beni Amer of East Africa, and the Tira of Sudan, the exclusionary principle has been driven by evolving social factors.|$|R
50|$|Mysore Narasimhachar Srinivas (1916-1999) was an Indian sociologist. He {{is mostly}} {{known for his}} work on <b>caste</b> and <b>caste</b> <b>systems,</b> social stratification, Sanskritisation and Westernisation in {{southern}} India and the concept of 'Dominant Caste'.|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of nymphs into adults can take months; {{the time period}} depends on food availability, temperature, and {{the general population of}} the colony. Since nymphs are unable to feed themselves, workers must feed them, but workers also take part in the social life of the colony and have certain other tasks to accomplish such as foraging, building or maintaining the nest or tending to the queen. Pheromones regulate the <b>caste</b> <b>system</b> in termite colonies, preventing all but a very few of the termites from becoming fertile queens.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Narayan {{published}} his next novel, A Tiger for Malgudi, about a tiger {{and its relationship}} with humans. His next novel, Talkative Man, published in 1986, was the tale of an aspiring journalist from Malgudi. During this time, he also published two collections of short stories: Malgudi Days (1982), a revised edition including the original book and some other stories, and Under the Banyan Tree and Other Stories, a new collection. In 1987, he completed A Writer's Nightmare, another collection of essays about topics {{as diverse as the}} <b>caste</b> <b>system,</b> Nobel prize winners, love, and monkeys. The collection included essays he had written for newspapers and magazines since 1958.|$|E
5|$|In a Hindu <b>caste</b> <b>system</b> {{that was}} conspicuously present, Brahmins enjoyed a privileged {{position}} as providers {{of knowledge and}} local justice. These Brahmins were normally involved in careers that revolved around religion and learning {{with the exception of}} a few who achieved success in martial affairs. They were patronised by kings, nobles and wealthy aristocrats who persuaded learned Brahmins to settle in specific towns and villages by making them grants of land and houses. The relocation of Brahmin scholars was calculated to be in the interest of the kingdom as they were viewed as persons detached from wealth and power and their knowledge was a useful tool to educate and teach ethical conduct and discipline in local communities. Brahmins were also actively involved in solving local problems by functioning as neutral arbiters (Panchayat).|$|E

5|$|Jaffna's {{history of}} being an {{independent}} kingdom lends legitimacy to the political claims of the Sri Lankan Tamils, and has provided a focus for their constitutional demands. Northern Tamil society is generally categorised into two groups: those who are from the Jaffna peninsula in the north, {{and those who are}} residents of the Vanni to the immediate south. The Jaffna society is separated by castes. Historically, the Vellalar, who form approximately fifty percent of the population, were involved in agriculture, using the services of castes collectively known as Panchamar (Tamil for group of five). The Panchamar consisted of the Nalavar, Pallar, Parayar, Vannar, and Ambattar. Others such as the Karaiyar, existed outside the agriculture-based <b>caste</b> <b>system.</b> The caste of temple priests known as Iyers were also held in high esteem.|$|E
5|$|Morikawa Kaichirō {{identifies}} the subculture as distinctly Japanese, {{a product of}} the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a <b>caste</b> <b>system,</b> but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of otaku. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society {{identifies the}} value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the otaku subculture.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 18th century, {{the society}} of the kingdom {{followed}} age-old and deeply established norms of social interaction between people. Accounts by contemporaneous travellers indicate the widespread practice of the Hindu <b>caste</b> <b>system</b> and of animal sacrifices during the nine-day celebrations (called Mahanavami). Later, fundamental changes occurred due to the struggle between native and foreign powers. Though wars between the Hindu kingdoms and the Sultanates continued, the battles between native rulers (including Muslims) and the newly arrived British took centre stage. The spread of English education, the introduction of the printing press and the criticism of the prevailing social system by Christian missionaries helped make the society more open and flexible. The rise of modern nationalism throughout India also affected Mysore.|$|E
50|$|After the {{establishment}} of State of Hyderabad, many Farooquies took up the job of judges, ombudsmen, and other law professions. As per the <b>caste</b> <b>systems</b> which recognized families by profession instead of ancestry, their family name became Qazi, along with Sayyids and Siddiquis etc. However these families continued to identify themselves are Farooqis.|$|R

Modernization eliminated Korean <b>castes</b> <b>system.</b> The first brothels in Korea began to spread after the country first opened its port in 1876 through a diplomatic pact, causing ethnic quarters for Japanese migrants to sprout up in Busan, Wonsan and Incheon.|$|R
