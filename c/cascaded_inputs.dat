40|$|This paper {{develops}} a randomized approach for incrementally building deep neural networks, where a supervisory mechanism is proposed to constrain the random assignment of the weights and biases, {{and all the}} hidden layers have direct links to the output layer. A fundamental result on the universal approximation property is established for such a class of randomized leaner models, namely deep stochastic configuration networks (DeepSCNs). A learning algorithm is presented to implement DeepSCNs with either specific architecture or self-organization. The read-out weights attached with all direct links from each hidden layer to the output layer are evaluated by the least squares method. Given a set of training examples, DeepSCNs can speedily produce a learning representation, that is, a collection of random basis functions with the <b>cascaded</b> <b>inputs</b> together with the read-out weights. An empirical study on a function approximation is carried out to demonstrate some properties of the proposed deep learner model. Comment: Manuscript submitted to NIPS on May 19, 201...|$|E

To investigate ERK activation in real time, we expressed an ERK–GFP fusion protein in human mammary epithelial cells.

The oscillations were persistent (> 45 cycles), independent of cell cycle phase, and were highly dependent on cell density, essentially disappearing at confluency. Oscillations occurred even at ligand doses that elicited very low levels of ERK phosphorylation, and could be detected biochemically in both transfected and nontransfected cells.

40|$|The minor isotope 232 U may {{ultimately}} {{be used for}} detection or confirmation of uranium {{in a variety of}} applications. The primary advantage of 232 U as an indicator of the presence of enriched uranium is the plentiful and penetrating nature of the radiation emitted by its daughter radionuclide 208 Tl. A possible drawback to measuring uranium via 232 U is the relatively high uncertainty in 232 U abundance both within and between material populations. An important step in assessing this problem is to ascertain what determines the 232 U concentration within any particular sample of uranium. To this end, we here analyze the production and eventual enrichment of 232 U during fuel-cycle operations. The goal of this analysis is to allow approximate prediction of 232 U quantities, or at least some interpretation of the results of 232 U measurements. We have found that 232 U is produced via a number of pathways during reactor irradiation of uranium and is subsequently concentrated during the later enrichment of the uranium' s 235 U Content. While exact calculations are nearly impossible for both the reactor-production and cascade-enrichment parts of the prediction problem, estimates and physical bounds can be provided as listed below and detailed within the body of the report. Even if precise calculations for the irradiation and enrichment were possible, the ultimate 212 U concentration would still depend upon the detailed fuel-cycle history. Assuming that a thennal-diffusion cascade is used to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU), dilution of reactor-processed fuel at the <b>cascade</b> <b>input</b> and the long-term holdup of 232 U within the cascade both affect the 232 U concentration in the product. Similar issues could be expected to apply for the other isotope-separation technologies that are used in other countries. Results of this analysis are listed below: 0 The 232 U concentration depends strongly on the uranium enrichment, with depleted uranium (DU) containing between 1600 and 8000 times less 232 U than HEU does. * The 236 U/ 232 U concentration ratio in HEU is likely to be between 10 {sup 6 } and 2 x 10 {sup 7 }. 0 Plutonium-production reactors yield uranium with between I and 10 ppt of 232 u. 0 Much higher 132 U concentrations can be obtained in some situations. * Significant variation in the 232 U concentration is inevitable. * Cascade enrichment increases the 232 U concentration by a factor of at least 200, and possibly as much as 1000. 0 The actual 232 U concentration depends upon the dilution at the <b>cascade</b> <b>input...</b>|$|R

40|$|Steady {{increases}} in the bandwidth requirements of access networks and local area networks have created a need for short-reach links supporting data rates of 10 Gb/s and larger. Server applications and data center applications too require such links. The primary challenge for these links lies in {{the reduction of the}} cost while retaining or improving the performance. Traditionally, multimode fiber (MMF) has satisfied these needs because of its low installation cost resulting from the alignment tolerance associated with the large core size. However, in view of the ever-increasing performance requirements, extraction of the best performance requires a holistic view of the channel that involves global optimization of transmitter, fiber, receiver performance and signaling strategies. The optimization results in a channel impairment mitigation technique that is a combination of optical, opto-electronic, and electronic methods. Both glass and plastic MMF links have been addressed in this work and many of the advances apply equally to both media. One example that applies strictly to glass MMF is the use of Raman amplification to not only combat attenuation but to reduce intersymbol interference (ISI). Raman amplification was demonstrated as an optical channel impairment mitigation technique enabling multi-km, multi-Gb/s transmission over glass-MMF. We demonstrated both numerically and experimentally that a power penalty reduction of 1. 4 dBo can be achieved for 10 Gb/s transmission over 9 km of 62 micron glass MMF with a Raman pump power 250 mW. In recent years, plastic optical fiber (POF) has emerged as a potentially lower cost alternative to glass-MMF in enabling high performance links. The primary objective of this research is to explore the possibilities and develop low-cost, short-reach, high-data-rate POF-links. Using a comprehensive multimode fiber model, we showed that strong mode coupling, together with a reasonably accurate refractive index profile enables 40 Gb/s transmission over 200 m of graded-index POF. We experimentally demonstrated 40 Gb/s error-free transmission over 100 m of graded index perfluorinated POF (GI-PF-POF). We also demonstrated that even larger core (120 micron) GI-PF-POF can support > 10 Gb/s over 100 m length. We numerically computed and experimentally measured the differential modal delay of GI-PF-POF to demonstrate that the available bandwidth is nearly independent of the launch conditions. Therefore, the alignment tolerance at the transmitter is increased resulting in a dramatically reduced packaging cost at the transmitter. However, the large-core POF increases the difficultly in capturing of the light efficiently onto a detector and results in optical power penalty and associated modal noise. To solve this, we have designed and developed a 10 Gb/s photoreceiver consisting of a large (100 micron diameter) GaAs PIN photodetector and a regulated <b>cascade</b> <b>input</b> based transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with low input impedance. Thus, a low-cost, alignment-tolerant, high-data-rate link is realized that uses a high-power, high-speed vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) transmitter, large-core, high-speed GI-PF-POF, and the developed receiver.

This paper presents a novel and systematic parameter estimation procedure for such models and applies the method to two neural estimation problems: (i) compressed-sensing based neural mapping from multi-neuron excitation, and (ii) estimation of neural receptive fields in sensory neurons. The proposed estimation algorithm models the neurons via a graphical model and then estimates the parameters in the model using a recently-developed generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) method. The GAMP method is based on Gaussian approximations of loopy belief propagation. In the neural connectivity problem, the GAMP-based method is shown to be computational efficient, provides a more exact modeling of the sparsity, can incorporate nonlinearities in the output and significantly outperforms previous compressed-sensing methods. For the receptive field estimation, the GAMP method can also exploit inherent structured sparsity in the linear weights. The method is validated on estimation of linear nonlinear Poisson (LNP) cascade models for receptive fields of salamander retinal ganglion cells. ...|$|R

The fuel rich rocket exhaust fluid provides the fuel source for secondary combustion with the ingested air in the ramjet combustion chamber. This study parametrically investigates the thermodynamic performance and sizing requirement of the ram-rocket as a function of flight altitude, flight velocity, rocket oxidizer/fuel ratio, air/rocket exhaust flow ratio, and inlet static pressure ratio. It also examines the effect of Subsonic and Supersonic mixing/combustion. The engine is analyzed by the <b>cascade</b> analysis technique. <b>Input</b> data are the operating conditions. Output are the matching geometry and perfomance parameters including thrust, thrust augmentation ratio, and thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC). Due to the parametrical nature of the study and the extensive usage of iterative calculation techniques, a computer program was developed to facilitate the analysis. (See more in text. ...|$|R
