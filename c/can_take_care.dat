Riley Abel steps in to break up the fight, beating one of the boys and making the others flee. Ellie becomes angered by this, claiming that she <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of herself. Riley then advises Ellie to flee, but the latter is caught and assigned to cleaning duty. While she is completing the chore, she realizes that Riley stole her Walkman, and later demands that she return it, which Riley reluctantly does.|$|E
5|$|The baby drifts downriver to {{a village}} of the Nelwyn (dwarves). She comes into the care of Willow Ufgood, a kind farmer and conjurer who hopes to become a real sorcerer; his wife Kiaya and his {{children}} {{fall in love with}} the baby immediately, and Willow too soon grows to love her as one of his own. During a town festival, the village is attacked by a Nockmaar hound which is quickly killed by the village warriors. The High Aldwin, the village sorcerer, learns about the baby and selects Willow, due to his devotion to the child, to accompany a party of volunteers returning the baby to the Daikini (human) people. At a crossroads, they find a human warrior named Madmartigan trapped in a crow's cage. The rest of the party want to give the baby to Madmartigan and go home immediately, but Willow and his friend Meegosh refuse, so the others leave. After spending the night at the crossroads and meeting an army led by Airk Thaughbaer, an old friend of Madmartigan's marching against Bavmorda, Willow reluctantly decides to free Madmartigan so that he <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the baby for them.|$|E
25|$|In the Canadian {{province}} of New Brunswick, collisions with moose are frequent enough that all new highways have fences to prevent moose from accessing the road, as {{has long been}} done in Finland, Norway, and Sweden. A demonstration project, Highway7 between Fredericton and Saint John, which {{has one of the}} highest frequencies of moose collisions in the province, did not have these fences until 2008, although it was and continues to be extremely well signed. Newfoundland and Labrador recommended that motorists use caution between dusk and dawn because that is when moose are most active and most difficult to see, increasing the risk of collisions. Local moose sightings are often reported on radio stations so that motorists <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> while driving in particular areas.|$|E

Homer manages to negotiate that he {{perform at the}} zoo through a new contract with a new act. After Kidkill refuses his original act (which was simply Homer prancing around in a monkey suit), he goes to his second plan; an act where he rides a tricycle with Butch Patrick on his shoulders, both of them dressed as Eddie Munster, on a stage as both are being attacked by cobras (some real, some merely animatronic snakes packed with venom). Inspired by Homer's example, Apu and Manjula resolve that they <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of their kids, while Homer is mercilessly attacked by several of the snakes and a mongoose put in to contain them.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eve of}} her 18th birthday, Rapunzel {{requests}} to leave the tower and discover {{the source of the}} lanterns, but Gothel refuses, claiming that the outside world is a dangerous place. Meanwhile, thief Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel's crown from the kingdom and inadvertently discovers the tower after ditching his allies, the Stabbington brothers. Rapunzel captures Flynn and discovers the crown, but is unaware of its significance. Rapunzel plans to take Flynn to Gothel to prove she <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of herself, but before she can do so, Gothel becomes angry, quickly silencing Rapunzel. Rapunzel then asks for a special paint that will take Gothel three days' round trip to obtain and return, and Gothel accepts.

She tells her servant Ninshubur (Lady Evening), a reference to Inanna's role as the evening star, that if she does not return in three days, to get help from her father Anu, Enlil, king of the gods, or Enki. When she does not return, Ninshubur approaches Anu only to be told that he understands that his daughter is strong and <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of herself. Enlil tells Ninshubur he is much too busy running the cosmos. Enki immediately expresses concern and dispatches his Galla demons, Galaturra or Kurgarra, sexless beings created from the dirt from beneath the god's finger-nails, to recover the young goddess. These beings may be the origin of the Greco-Roman Galli, androgynous beings of the third sex, similar to the American Indian berdache, who played an important part in early religious ritual.|$|E

He tells Tony they have information regarding the location of Tony's estranged wife, Elvira, and he arranges to meet. However, the meet is a set up. Tony escapes and kills Pablo, realizing that Sheffield has turned against him. Meanwhile, he sets about taking control of Downtown from the Contreras cartel. Upon doing so, he is contacted by The Sandman (Steven Bauer), a cocaine producer from the Caribbean islands south of Miami. Sandman also wants Sosa out of the picture, and he invites Tony to come to see him. They agree that with Tony in Miami selling Sandman's product from the islands, they can run Sosa out of business. Tony then meets Venus (Cree Summer), Sandman's ex-girlfriend and a powerful influence on the islands herself. She tells him of {{the owner of a}} nearby casino, being run on a disused oil tanker, who is killing women and dumping their bodies overboard, and asks Tony if he <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of it. The man turns out to be Nacho Contreras, formerly in control of Downtown's drug trade. Tony travels to the casino and kills Nacho.|$|E
500|$|Meyer has {{dismissed}} such criticisms, arguing {{both that}} the books center around Bella's choice, which she perceives {{as the foundation}} of modern feminism, and that Bella's damsel in distress persona is due only to her humanity. Meyer also added, [...] "Just because [...] doesn't do kung fu and she cooks for her father doesn't make her worthy of that criticism". Shannon Simcox of The Daily Collegian has similarly dismissed the criticism surrounding Bella, commenting, [...] "While Bella plays the perfect damsel in distress that gets herself into sticky situations, she is also very in control of herself. She chose to move to Forks and be in a new place; she constantly faces a bunch {{of people who want to}} suck the life right out of her, and she is constantly pleading to become a vampire, too, so she <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of herself and Edward." ...|$|E
500|$|With the album, OutKast {{wanted to}} make a {{statement}} about urban life as an African American in the South, particularly Atlanta. Written when they were teenagers, much of the album addresses coming of age topics, and has themes of self-empowerment and reflections on life in the New South. Encyclopedia of Popular Music editor Colin Larkin writes that the album [...] "compris tales of the streets of their local East Point and Decatur neighbourhoods". The album's segue tracks illustrate Southern life. The lyrics incorporate tongue-twisters, triplet rhyme schemes, repetitive vocal hooks, Southern slang, such as the recurring phrase [...] "ain't no thang but a chicken wing" [...] repeated throughout [...] "Ain't No Thang". The duo also intersperse their lyrics with references to classic cars, marijuana use, s, and players, which Big Boi defines as [...] "somebody who <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of they business in the game, the game of life".

500|$|When {{developing}} {{the characteristics of}} their version of Lois Lane, the writers took inspiration from other leading ladies in cinema, for example, Karen Allen's character Marion Ravenwood, from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Todd Slavkin describes the character as having a [...] "sophisticated, worldly experience", and {{was considered to be}} more of an adult {{than the rest of the}} cast. Durance believes that she embodies many of the characteristics that the creative team wanted to show in their version of Lois, specifically the fact that Lois has a lot of [...] "nervous energy" [...] from trying to [...] "find herself", the same nervous energy that Durance brings to the role. The actress also relates to Lois's sassy, and independent nature, but, conversely, she is not as extroverted as Lois. Gough describes the character as coming from the school of hard knocks; she is street smart, and a very capable woman. Durance believes her character is [...] "fiercely independent", but at the same time she is not afraid to admit that she has flaws, and she is only human; Lois also does not feel sorry about having those flaws. She goes into further detail, identifying the character as more of a tomboy who is vulnerable, with Gough adding that she is also [...] "slightly neurotic". BuddyTV's John Kubicek characterizes her as a fast-talking woman, who, though she whines over petty annoyances, <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of herself. He goes on to further describe how she is not afraid of getting herself into trouble just so she can dig herself out.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, Clark {{is forced}} to find all three stones, which results in the {{creation}} of the Fortress of Solitude in the season five premiere. There, Jor-El informs Clark he needs to begin his training in order to complete his destiny, but Clark interrupts the training to go back to Smallville, which forces Jor-El to strip Clark of his powers. When Clark is killed in his mortal body in season five's [...] "Hidden", Jor-El resurrects Clark with his powers; as a result, Jonathan's life is traded for Clark's in the episode [...] "Reckoning". Clark's consistent disobedience forces Jor-El to imprison his son in a block of ice in the season seven episode [...] "Blue", but after learning a clone of Clark has returned to Smallville in [...] "Persona", Jor-El frees his son so he <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the creature. When Clark thinks a world without him would be better, Jor-El sends Clark to an alternate reality to show him the world would be worse if he did not exist in it. By the start of season nine, Jor-El begins fully training Clark for his ultimate destiny. As part of that training, Jor-El informs Clark he needs to tune his Kryptonian intuition. To do so, Jor-El gives Clark the ability to read people's thoughts, only to take it away at an important moment and force Clark to apply what he has learned about human behavior. A clone of Jor-El is released on Earth in the episode [...] "Kandor", but he is murdered before he can fully reunite with Clark and is only able to share a single moment with his son before dying.|$|E

For example, the leader may pose a question only to be greeted with docile silence, as though he or she had not spoken at all. The leader may be idealized into a kind of god who <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of his or her children, and some especially ambitious leaders may be susceptible to this role.

2500|$|Problems with {{dentures}} {{may arise}} because patients {{are not used}} to having something in their mouth that is not food. The brain senses the appliance and interprets it as 'food', sending messages to the salivary glands to produce more saliva and to secrete it at a higher rate. This usually only happens in the first 12 to 24 hours, after which the salivary glands return to their normal output. [...] New dentures can also be the cause of sore spots as they compress the denture-bearing soft tissues (mucosa). [...] A few denture adjustments in the days following insertion of the dentures <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of this problem. [...] is another problem encountered by a minority of patients. [...] At times, {{this may be due to}} a denture that is too loose, too thick or extended too far posteriorly onto the soft palate. [...] At times, gagging may also be attributed to psychological denial of the denture. Psychological gagging is the most difficult to treat since it is out of the dentist's control. [...] In such cases, an implant-supported palateless denture may have to be constructed. Sometimes there could be a gingivitis infection under the completed dentures, caused by the accumulation of dental plaque. One of the most common problems for wearers of new upper complete denture is a loss of taste sensations.|$|E

However, Cruella and the Blind Witch lock the outsiders in the library, in their plot to take over the Underworld in Hades' absence, and to keep them away from the portal. Regina suspects the Blind Witch had help from Hades since she's doesn't usually cast that strong magic. As Emma and Hook continue the search for ambrosia, Emma physically weighs her heart to see if she is worthy as she places it on a scale but the weight is increasing her pain, and even Hook tries to grab it but he starts to catch fire. This has left Emma with two choices, saving her heart or Hook, and when she chooses the latter, a door opens as she is deemed worthy, only to discover that the tree had been cut down, and the leftover Ambrosia had been dead for a long time.
