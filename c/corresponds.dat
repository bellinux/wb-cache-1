5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} proceeds in {{a series}} of steps such that the output of each step is used as an input for the next one.

50|$|Individual {{elements}} of a commutative C*-algebra <b>correspond</b> with continuous functions. And so certain types of functions can <b>correspond</b> to certain properties of a C*-algebra.

50|$|Congruence tests {{look for}} all pairs of <b>corresponding</b> sides {{to be equal}} in length, though except {{in the case of}} the {{triangle}} this is not sufficient to establish congruence (as exemplified by a square and a rhombus that have the same side length). Similarity tests look at whether the ratios of the lengths of each pair of <b>corresponding</b> sides are equal, though again this is not sufficient. In either case equality of <b>corresponding</b> angles is also necessary; equality (or proportionality) of <b>corresponding</b> sides combined with equality of <b>corresponding</b> angles is necessary and sufficient for congruence (or similarity). The <b>corresponding</b> angles as well as the <b>corresponding</b> sides are defined as appearing in the same sequence, so for example if in a polygon with the side sequence abcde and another with the <b>corresponding</b> side sequence vwxyz we have vertex angle A appearing between sides a and b then its <b>corresponding</b> vertex angle V must appear between sides v and w.|$|R

40|$|A {{corollary}} of Grassman’s linearity law is formally derived, and states: If {{a number}} of colors have a <b>corresponding</b> color appearance A in different illuminants, then their complementary colors have a <b>corresponding</b> color appearance B. The informal logic is that: (1) a perceived color has only one complementary color; (2) two or more <b>corresponding</b> colors have the same complementary color (given the illuminant whites are a color match); so (3) the complementary colors to <b>corresponding</b> colors will themselves be a set of <b>corresponding</b> colors.

5|$|Martin, Odlyzko, and Wolfram {{investigate}} pseudoforests {{that model}} {{the dynamics of}} cellular automata. These functional graphs, which they call state transition diagrams, have one vertex for each possible configuration that the ensemble of cells of the automaton can be in, and an edge connecting each configuration to the configuration that follows it according to the automaton's rule. One can infer properties of the automaton from the structure of these diagrams, such {{as the number of}} components, length of limiting cycles, depth of the trees connecting non-limiting states to these cycles, or symmetries of the diagram. For instance, any vertex with no incoming edge <b>corresponds</b> to a Garden of Eden pattern and a vertex with a self-loop <b>corresponds</b> to a still life pattern.|$|E
