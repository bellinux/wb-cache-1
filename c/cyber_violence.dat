50|$|Cyberbullying {{is a form}} of {{intimidation}} using electronic forms of contact. In the 21st century, cyberbullying has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers in Western countries.On September 24, 2015, the United Nations Broadband Commission released a report that claimed that almost 75% percent of women online have encountered harassment and threats of violence, otherwise known as <b>cyber</b> <b>violence.</b> Misogynistic rhetoric is prevalent online, and the public debate over gender-based attacks has increased significantly, leading to calls for policy interventions and better responses by social networks like Facebook and Twitter.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cyber</b> <b>violence</b> is growing; it is {{a global}} problem for governments, {{educational}} authorities, teachers, parents and children alike, the author argues. Given the insidious nature and rapid rise in <b>cyber</b> <b>violence,</b> the paucity of empirical research on <b>cyber</b> <b>violence</b> and cyber safety, {{it is clear that}} we need a concerted effort on both the policy and practical level. Most importantly, we need substantial funding to investigate what remains an under-researched area so as to inform good policy and practice. The article discusses why <b>cyber</b> <b>violence</b> is happening; what the main issues are; how to improve cyber safety; and existing safety initiatives. The author concludes that current initiatives to address <b>cyber</b> <b>violence</b> and cyber safety are well intended but we need to make a more concerted and systematic effort, based on further research, if we are to tackle the problem through policy and practice on the national and global level. <br /...|$|E

Despite substantial funding for information dissemination on preventative strategies {{and the development of}} electronic responses to hinder perpetrators, the phenomenon of <b>cyber</b> <b>violence</b> has received little attention in the educational research literature. This review paper outlines the status on existing research into <b>cyber</b> <b>violence.</b> Documenting and summarizing the facts on the nature and extend of the issue will inform future debate.

40|$|Cyber dating {{abuse is}} {{a new kind of}} dating violence. Several recent {{measures}} assess this phenomenon, but do not focus on a severe aggression that aims to spoil a partner’s relational network (relational cyber abuse). This study developed and validated the <b>Cyber</b> Dating <b>Violence</b> Inventory (CDVI) with 1405 adolescents and young adults (Mage = 18. 17; SDage = 2. 39; 65. 1 % females), an instrument that considers the relational dimension of online dating abuse. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses found two correlated factors (Psychological and Relational) for both perpetration and victimization, showing good reliability. CDVI factors were positively correlated with offline dating violence, showing good criterion validity. This instrument has clinical and educational implications...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{outlines the}} latest incarnation of Owen’s (2014) evolving, meta-theoretical, Genetic-Social framework, and the {{intention is to}} illustrate the explanatory potential of the sensitizing device, in particular meta-constructs such as the biological variable (the evidence from behavioural genetics for an, at least in part, biological influence upon human behaviour), psychobiography (the unique, asocial, inherited aspects of the person such as disposition), and neuro-agency (a new term which acknowledges the influence of neurons upon human ‘free-will’), in the task of conceptualising <b>cyber</b> <b>violence.</b> In what follows, <b>cyber</b> <b>violence</b> is reconceptualised, moving the definition beyond the usual notion of gendered online violence towards a broader conception which incorporates hate trolling, cyber-terrorism, predatory online sexual ‘grooming’ and so on. It is the contention here that the synthesis ‘applied’ to <b>cyber</b> <b>violence</b> via flexible causal prediction may be of use to criminological theorists, social policy-makers and practitioners {{working in the field}} of the criminal justice in the task of constructing predictive models of <b>cyber</b> <b>violence...</b>|$|E

50|$|In United States {{civilian}} law enforcement, a Threat Management Unit is {{a police}} department team that provides criminal and behavioral analysis and risk assessments {{in an attempt}} to review, and ultimately mitigate, the potential for violence with an emphasis on prevention. Threat Management Units identify risk factors, patterns of escalation, and construct an environment that inhibits or prevents violence. The services provided cover a wide range of topics, including, but not limited to terrorism, school violence, sexual crimes, stalking, cyber crimes (<b>cyber</b> stalking), domestic <b>violence,</b> arson, sabotage, communicated threats, insider threats and pre-attack behavior. Research in this area of law enforcement is known as Threat Safety Science.|$|R

Although only four school years have passed in the story timeline since season six, season thirteen is set {{during the summer and}} the following school year in the years it aired. Writers have been able to use a semi-floating timeline, so that the issues depicted are modern for their viewers. This season depicts the lives of a group of high school freshmen, sophomores, seniors and graduates as they deal with some of the challenges and issues that teenagers face such as cancer, texting while driving, death, sexism, sleep disorders, <b>cyber</b> bullying, domestic <b>violence,</b> rape, racial profiling and relationships.|$|R

30|$|Electronic sexual {{coercion}} (ESC) is coercive sexting. This includes sending {{unwanted sexual}} photos, pressuring to send sexual photos, sharing sexual photos without permission, and pressuring {{to meet in}} person {{with the intent of}} sexual activity. This is also called gender-based <b>cyber</b> <b>violence.</b> Staff should help inform women and girls about the signs of ESC, steps to avoid, and safety planning. In some settings, documenting ESC can be helpful to survivors. Documentation may aid in building an evidence base for legal action, if these laws are applicable in the setting. Documentation may also help identify patterns in technology abuse and points of escalation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: When Internet was developed, the {{founding}} fathers of Internet hardly had any inclination that Internet could transform itself into an all pervading revolution which could be misused for criminal activities and which required regulation. Today, there are many disturbing things happening in cyberspace. The effect of <b>cyber</b> <b>violence</b> is more damaging than traditional bullying and has longer lasting effects. The effects can be social, emotional and academic maladjustment of the victims, which will be identified by the research. Due to rapid globalization, cheap mobile phones, easy access to internet and virtually no law to stop abusing school children by their fellow classmates, the problem of cyber crime among {{children and young adults}} are on the high. In the western society, even schools are brought under strict vigil of law and administration. Cyber crime, cyber bullying may be common issues in wester...|$|E
40|$|This book applies Owen’s unique genetic-social {{framework}} {{to the study}} of crime and criminal behaviour, with an emphasis on cybercrime. Moving beyond challenges which confront contemporary criminological theorizing such as: the stagnation of critical criminology, the relativistic nihilism of the ‘cultural turn’, posthumanism, and virtual criminology, the author codifies and ‘applies’ the latest version of the {{framework to}} the study of crime, {{both in and out of}} cyberspace. Drawing upon evolutionary psychology, behavioural genetics and the philosophy of Heidegger, he introduces new terms such as ‘Neuro-Agency’ and notions of Embodied Cognition into criminological theorizing. Adopting a soft compatibilist approach to free-will, and Realist ontology, Owen’s meta-theoretical focus provides a new direction for criminological theorizing, in particular in the direction of the conceptualization and prediction of <b>cyber</b> <b>violence.</b> Exciting and timely, this book will appeal to scholars and advanced students of criminology, law, sociology, social policy, psychology, philosophy, policing and forensic investigation...|$|E
40|$|Cyber hate {{can take}} many {{different}} forms from online material {{which can lead to}} actual offline abuse and <b>violence,</b> <b>cyber</b> violence; cyber stalking, and online harassment with the use of visual images, videos, chat rooms, text and social media which are intended to cause harm. This book examines the case for current guidelines dealing with online anti-Muslim abuse and concludes that we require a new understanding of this online behaviour and the impact it can have on vulnerable communities. It is unique as it focuses on new technology in the form of social media and the Internet and explores the challenges the police and other agencies face when confronting anti-Muslim abuse in cyberspace. It also provides a critique of how people are targeted by online offenders and helps us understand online anti-Muslim behaviour in a much more detailed and comprehensive way by bringing together a range of experts who will examine this phenomenon and critically discuss why they think it has become so much more prevalent than it was before...|$|R

After several weeks of non-focused psychosocial sessions (to build trust), service providers can call for an advanced ICT assessment where they assess the actual access of women and girls to technology, pace, needs, interests, safe ways of using technology, associated risks of violence using technology, previous good experiences using technology, and new ICT tools to explore. As a regular practice, service providers can also integrate questions on ICT risks and <b>cyber</b> <b>violence</b> in GBV risk assessments.|$|E
40|$|The Space Transition Theory (Jaishankar 2008) presupposes {{that people}} behave {{differently}} in the cyber world from the physical world amongst other postulates that seek to explain cyber criminal behavioural patterns. (Wall 2001) categorized cyber crime into the four main types of cyber trespass, cyber deception and theft, cyber pornography and <b>cyber</b> <b>violence.</b> This research sought test the postulates of the theory {{to determine if they}} form a viable and reliable basis for predicting or determining the occurrence of cyber crime. This was done by identifying the causal relationships between the first six postulates of the Space Transition Theory and the various categories of cyber crime. Primary data from Ghana was used together with secondary data {{from other parts of the}} world to test the theory. Findings from the research showed some limitations in the variety of cyber crimes perpetrated and experienced in Ghana. Our research also established that fact that the Space Transition theory’s postulates are not absolutely applicable to all categories of cyber crime. These outcomes serves as a significant reference point for both researchers, policy makers and anti cyber crime researchers...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{culture is}} part of children’s and adolescents’ {{everyday}} lives. Digital culture has {{both positive and negative}} consequences. One such negative consequence is <b>cyber</b> <b>violence</b> that has been termed cyber bullying. Cyber bullying can cause serious emotional, behavioural and academic problems for both the victim and the bully. Although there is ongoing research on the effects of cyber bullying on children and youth in South Africa, no research has been carried out on how children’s and youth’s spirituality may be affected when they are cyber bullied. This article discusses the accumulative results from different South African institutes that have researched the cyber bullying effects on children and adolescents. These results point to the spiritual effects that children and youth may experience as a result of cyber bullying. This article proposes that spirituality may prevent cyber bullying and even help children and youth heal from the trauma caused by cyber bullying. This article contributes in starting a conversation that may result in more specific research being done on how the spiritual lives of children and adolescents may be affected through the trauma caused by cyber bullying. </span...|$|E
40|$|Background: This paper explores {{problematic}} Internet gaming in {{the context}} of other forms of risky behaviour. The basic premise is that children and adolescents at risk will display different types of risky behaviour in various settings. Subjects and methods: Children and adolescents (N= 1150) were surveyed about (<b>cyber)</b> <b>violence,</b> problematic gaming (habits, motives and symptoms), self-disclosure via Facebook and self-esteem. Results: Regular gamers were more violent both face-to-face and via the Internet, and were more prone to problematic gaming than occasional gamers. Those who played games for more than five hours per day (9 % of respondents) were classified as potentially problematic gamers. They experienced and committed more violence both face-to-face and via the Internet, were more involved in self-disclosure and had more problematic gaming symptoms than those who played for less than five hours a day, but these groups did not differ in self-esteem. Participants could choose from a list of eight different motives for their gaming; those motivated by peer communication, a sense of control, relaxation, conformism, self-efficacy and to distract from problems reported more symptoms of problematic gaming than those not motivated by these factors. Gender, age, self-esteem, self-disclosure and committing violence contributed to explaining the variance in problematic gaming, accounting for about 26 % of its variance. Boys, lower self-esteem, more self-disclosure and committing both types of violence more regularly were connected with reporting more symptoms of problematic gaming. The results will be discussed {{in the context}} of a general proneness to risky behaviour. Conclusion: Committing violence against peers (both traditional and cyber) predicts significantly problematic gaming. This supports the premise that children and adolescents at risk are prone to exhibiting different forms of risky behaviour in different settings...|$|E
