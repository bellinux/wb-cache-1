5|$|The Chalk River, Ontario, {{site was}} {{established}} to rehouse the Allied effort at the Montreal Laboratory away from an urban area. A new community was built at Deep River, Ontario, to provide residences and facilities for the team members. The site was chosen for its proximity to the industrial manufacturing area of Ontario and Quebec, and proximity to a rail head adjacent to a large military base, Camp Petawawa. Located on the Ottawa River, it had access to abundant water. The first {{director of the new}} laboratory was Hans von Halban. He was replaced by John Cockcroft in May 1944, who in turn was succeeded by Bennett Lewis in September 1946. A pilot reactor known as ZEEP (zero-energy experimental pile) became the first Canadian reactor, and the first to be completed outside the United States, when it went <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> September 1945, ZEEP remained in use by researchers until 1970. A larger 10MW NRX reactor, which was designed during the war, was completed and went <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> July 1947.|$|E
5|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation frequently has specific requirements for X-ray crystallography. The intense ionizing radiation can cause radiation damage to samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from radiation damage, by freezing the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperatures (~100 K). However, {{synchrotron radiation}} frequently {{has the advantage}} of user selectable wavelengths, allowing for anomalous scattering experiments which maximizes anomalous signal. This is <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> experiments such as SAD and MAD.|$|E

5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} {{out of sight of}} predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E

From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide.

5|$|Clark's men easily {{captured}} Vincennes and Fort Sackville. Prior {{to their}} arrival in 1778, Clark had sent Captain Leonard Helm to Vincennes to gather intelligence. In addition, Father Pierre Gibault, a local priest, helped persuade the town's inhabitants {{to side with}} the Americans. Before Clark and his men set out to recapture Vincennes in 1779, Francis Vigo provided Clark with additional information on the town, its surrounding area, and the fort. Clark was already aware of the fort's military strength, poor location (surrounded by houses that could provide cover), and dilapidated condition before his arrival. Clark's strategy of a surprise attack and strong intelligence were <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> catching Hamilton and his men unaware and vulnerable.After hatcheting five captive Indians to death within view of the fort, Clark forced its surrender.|$|E
5|$|Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, and The New York Times Book Review {{considered}} Middlesex one of {{the best}} books of 2002, and some scholars believed the novel should be considered for the title of Great American Novel.

Designed by Eugene Wigner and built {{under the direction of}} Walter Zinn, it went critical on 15 May 1944. An allocation of heavy water was used by the Chalk River Laboratories to build ZEEP under Kowarski's direction, which went <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> September 1945. This was followed by its NRX rector in 1947, which was also moderated by heavy water. Like CP-3 and ZEEP it was used for scientific research, and not for plutonium production.|$|E

The Jewish Haganah militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of Balad al-Shaykh, where many of the Arab refinery workers lived, in what became known as the Balad al-Shaykh massacre.

During the medieval period, the Arab world was <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> the exchange of crops and technology between the European, Asia and African continents.

5|$|The Montreal team in Canada {{depended}} on the Americans for supplies of heavy water from the US heavy water plant in Trail, British Columbia, (which was under American contract), as well as technical information about plutonium. The Americans {{said that they would}} give heavy water to the Montreal group only if it agreed to direct its research along the limited lines suggested by du Pont. Despite doing much good work, by June 1943 work at the Montreal Lab had come to a complete standstill. Morale was low and the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project. In April 1944, a Combined Policy Committee meeting in Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor. John Cockcroft became the director. The Americans supported the project with information and visits. They also supplied material, for example, uranium and heavy water. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and in 1946 the Montreal Laboratory was closed. The project developed the ZEEP reactor, which went <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> September 1945.|$|E

We briefly discuss the history of <b>critical</b> geography <b>in</b> Germany, leading to a comparison of the conditions of critical geography around 1980 and in recent years. The focus is on two factors in the changed role of <b>critical</b> perspectives <b>in</b> German geography: (1) the growing internationalisation of German geography, which opened new avenues and allowed new approaches to enter the discipline; and (2) the high citation indices of "critical" journals, which leads to an enhanced reputation and a high significance of international <b>critical</b> geography <b>in</b> the German discipline. However, we draw an ambiguous conclusion: the increased role of <b>critical</b> approaches <b>in</b> German geography is linked to a growing neoliberalisation of academia and a decline of <b>critical</b> approaches <b>in</b> other disciplines. ...|$|R
