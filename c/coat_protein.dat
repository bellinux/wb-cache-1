25|$|MS2 tagging: by {{incorporating}} RNA stem loops, such as MS2, into a gene, these become incorporated into newly synthesized RNA. The stem loops {{can then be}} detected using a fusion of GFP and the MS2 <b>coat</b> <b>protein,</b> which has a high affinity, sequence-specific interaction with the MS2 stem loops. The recruitment of GFP {{to the site of}} transcription is visualized as a single fluorescent spot. This new approach has revealed that transcription occurs in discontinuous bursts, or pulses (see Transcriptional bursting). With the notable exception of in situ techniques, most other methods provide cell population averages, and are not capable of detecting this fundamental property of genes.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of tobacco mosaic virus {{in the history}} of viruses cannot be overstated. It was the first virus to be discovered, and the first to be crystallised and its structure shown in detail. The first X-ray diffraction pictures of the crystallised virus were obtained by Bernal and Fankuchen in 1941. On the basis of her pictures, Rosalind Franklin discovered the full structure of the virus in 1955. In the same year, Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat and Robley Williams showed that purified tobacco mosaic virus RNA and its <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> can assemble by themselves to form functional viruses, suggesting that this simple mechanism was probably the means through which viruses were created within their host cells.|$|E
25|$|The first {{virus that}} could be crystalized and whose {{structure}} could therefore be elucidated in detail was tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the virus that had been studied earlier by Ivanovski and Beijerink. In 1935, Wendell Stanley achieved its crystallization for electron microscopy and showed that it remains active even after crystallization. Clear X-ray diffraction pictures of the crystallized virus were obtained by Bernal and Fankuchen in 1941. Based on such pictures, Rosalind Franklin proposed the full structure of the tobacco mosaic virus in 1955. Also in 1955, Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat and Robley Williams showed that purified TMV RNA and its capsid (<b>coat)</b> <b>protein</b> can self-assemble into functional virions, suggesting that this assembly mechanism is also used within the host cell, as Delbrück had proposed earlier.|$|E

40|$|Characterization of the {{structure}} and dynamics of viral <b>coat</b> <b>proteins,</b> Pf 1 and fd, is important for understanding complex molecular events that take place during viral life cycles. These <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> undergo structural changes from the membrane-bound to the intact viral form during the viral assembly process. The structural changes are determined by a novel approach of combined high resolution multi-dimensional NMR techniques with that of solid-state, and by isotopic labeling of the protein uniformly with 15 N alone and in combination with 2 H. ^ The <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> in detergent micelles, dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) and sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), mimic their membrane environments. The <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> {{in the presence of}} the micelles form a protein-micelle complex and under such conditions, solution NMR spectroscopy can be applied. Even though the <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> are small (only 46 to 50 residue), their micelle-bound form represents a relatively large system (molecular weight ∼ 25, 000 to 30, 000 daltons) by current NMR spectroscopic standards. Because of effective molecular weight and size, the complex molecules reorient slowly in solution. Short T 2 relaxation time is the direct consequence of the slow reorientation in solution, and thus broad and poorly resolved 1 H resonance lines are typically observed. Spin-diffusion also becomes very efficient under these conditions and it becomes necessary to overcome these problems. Isotopic labelling of the <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> uniformly with both 15 N and 2 H narrows the 1 H resonance lines by diluting 1 H- 1 H dipolar interactions and reduces the spin-diffusion by having deuterons bound to aliphatic carbon sites. ^ The secondary structure of filamentous bacteriophage <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> has been determined on the basis of distance measurements of 1 H/ 1 H homonuclear NOE in micelles, while the arrangements of the major elements of secondary structure have been derived from measurements of angular parameters in oriented bilayers. The dynamics of the protein are described by motional averaging of line shapes observed in solid-state NMR experiments, and 15 N/ 1 H heteronuclear NOE measurements. ...|$|R
2500|$|Following Rosalind Franklin's {{confirmation}} of the helical structure of DNA, James D. Watson and Francis Crick's publication {{of the structure of}} DNA in 1953 and Fred Sanger's publication of the Amino acid sequence of insulin in 1955, nucleic acid sequencing became a major target of early molecular biologists. In 1964, Robert W. Holley and colleagues published the first nucleic acid sequence ever determined, the ribonucleotide sequence of alanine transfer RNA. Extending this work, Marshall Nirenberg and Philip Leder revealed the triplet nature of the genetic code and were able to determine the sequences of 54 out of 64 codons in their experiments. In 1972, Walter Fiers and his team at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the University of Ghent (Ghent, Belgium) were the first to determine the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 <b>coat</b> <b>protein.</b> Fiers' group expanded on their MS2 <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> work, determining the complete nucleotide-sequence of bacteriophage MS2-RNA (whose genome encodes just four genes in 3569 base pairs [...] ) and Simian virus 40 in 1976 and 1978, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Papaya was genetically {{modified}} {{to resist the}} ringspot virus. 'SunUp' is a transgenic red-fleshed Sunset papaya cultivar that is homozygous for the <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> gene PRSV; 'Rainbow' is a yellow-fleshed F1 hybrid developed by crossing 'SunUp' and nontransgenic yellow-fleshed 'Kapoho'. The New York Times stated, [...] "in the early 1990s, Hawaii’s papaya industry was facing disaster because of the deadly papaya ringspot virus. Its single-handed savior was a breed engineered to be resistant to the virus. Without it, the state’s papaya industry would have collapsed. Today, 80% of Hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered, {{and there is still}} no conventional or organic method to control ringspot virus." [...] The GM cultivar was approved in 1998. In China, a transgenic PRSV-resistant papaya was developed by South China Agricultural University and was first approved for commercial planting in 2006; as of 2012 95% of the papaya grown in Guangdong province and 40% of the papaya grown in Hainan province was {{genetically modified}}.|$|E
2500|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{specific to}} the RNA genome is used to encourage resistance in cassava cultivars. [...] A recent study demonstrated that inducing the expression of hairpin RNA homologous to viral sequences is a potentially effective lab technique because it imitates {{the behavior of the}} plant immune system encountering foreign bodies. [...] Specifically, they were able to use hairpin RNA homologous to the 3’ end of CBSV <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> sequences in the cassava cultivar 60444 to develop resistance to both CBSV and UCBSV. [...] The resulting construct was transferred to a cultivar that farmers prefer (Nigerian landrace TME 7). This particular cultivar exhibited CMV resistance originally in its natural state, the motive being to foster resistance to both CMV and CBSV post – grafting, which was successful. [...] Therefore, the suggestion is that exploiting the immune system of plants that already have natural resistance to CMV is a potentially viable method to combat both viruses.|$|E
40|$|Nanoparticles can be {{encapsulated}} by virus <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> {{if their}} surfaces are functionalized {{to acquire a}} sufficiently large negative charge. A minimal surface charge is required to overcome (i) repulsive interactions between the positively charged RNA-binding domains on the proteins and (ii) the loss of mixing and translational entropy of RNA and capsid <b>coat</b> <b>proteins.</b> Here, we present a model describing the encapsulation of spherical particles bearing weakly acidic surface groups and investigate how charge regulation and size polydispersity impact upon the encapsulation efficiency of gold nanoparticles by model <b>coat</b> <b>proteins.</b> We show that the surface charge density of these particles cannot be assumed fixed, but that it adjusts itself to minimize electrostatic repulsion between the charges on them and maximize the attractive interaction with the RNA binding domains on the proteins.

2500|$|Plant viruses {{need to be}} {{transmitted}} by a vector, most often insects such as leafhoppers. One class of viruses, the Rhabdoviridae, has been proposed to actually be insect viruses that have evolved to replicate in plants. The chosen insect vector of a plant virus will often be the determining factor in that virus's host range: it can only infect plants that the insect vector feeds upon. This was shown in part when the old world white fly {{made it to the}} United States, where it transferred many plant viruses into new hosts. Depending on the way they are transmitted, plant viruses are classified as non-persistent, semi-persistent and persistent. In non-persistent transmission, viruses become attached to the distal tip of the stylet of the insect and on the next plant it feeds on, it inoculates it with the virus. Semi-persistent viral transmission involves the virus entering the foregut of the insect. Those viruses that manage to pass through the gut into the haemolymph and then to the salivary glands are known as persistent. There are two sub-classes of persistent viruses: propagative and circulative. Propagative viruses are able to replicate in both the plant and the insect (and may have originally been insect viruses), whereas circulative can not. Circulative viruses are protected inside aphids by the chaperone protein symbionin, produced by bacterial symbionts. [...] Many plant viruses encode within their genome polypeptides with domains essential for transmission by insects. In non-persistent and semi-persistent viruses, these domains are in the <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> and another protein known as the helper component. A bridging hypothesis has been proposed to explain how these proteins aid in insect-mediated viral transmission. The helper component will bind to the specific domain of the <b>coat</b> <b>protein,</b> and then the insect mouthparts — creating a bridge. In persistent propagative viruses, such as tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), there is often a lipid coat surrounding the proteins that is not seen in other classes of plant viruses. In the case of TSWV, 2 viral proteins are expressed in this lipid envelope. It has been proposed that the viruses bind via these proteins and are then taken into the insect cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis.|$|E

The hybrid RNA- 2 molecules were able to replicate in cowpea protoplasts in the presence of CPMV RNA- 1.
