5|$|<b>Certain</b> <b>things</b> {{cannot be}} attempted. These include conspiracy, under section 1(4) of the 1981 Act, {{assisting}} a criminal, under section 4(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1967, aiding {{in the commission}} of an offence, or most summary offences, with the logic being that they are too minor for attempts to justify a criminal conviction. A small number of separate statutory offences have been created to cover attempts concerning individual summary offences, in which case, usual attempt law and procedure applies.|$|E
5|$|To {{offset the}} {{difficulty}} of having things forbidden for use, there are <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> that are recommended by the Judges, and therefore grant Judge Points if used. Judge Points (JP) are used to carry out combos with nearby allies or to summon a Totema. JP are also received upon knocking out an opponent. Later in the game, the player gains {{the ability to use}} law cards, which can add laws, and anti-law cards, which can nullify laws that are already in effect.|$|E
5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E

5|$|Freya {{explains}} how {{she came to}} inhabit Chi's body. She reveals that she and Chi merely switched places inside the body, but Chi has shut herself away and Freya cannot contact her. Hideki asks why, and Freya explains that Chi discovered there were <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> that humans could do that she could not, leading her to believe that while Hideki would love her, it would make her existence unbearable. Hideki protests that it would not, but Freya tells him that Chi thought otherwise. She then tells Chitose {{that the time has}} come to destroy both of them, and she reluctantly agrees. Against Hideki's protestations, she deactivates Freya. Chi, however, has survived the deactivation and comes to the conclusion that while life with Hideki may seem painful because of her limitations, it is even more painful without him. She regains control of her body and completes her program, giving every persocom the ability to love then embraces Hideki.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{will feel}} very {{differently}} {{after you get}} over being tired and bewildered," [...] said Anne, who, knowing a <b>certain</b> <b>thing</b> that Leslie did not know, did not feel herself called upon to waste overmuch sympathy.|$|R
5|$|Long before {{working on}} Charlotte, Maeda had thought up a concept {{for a story}} with {{characters}} who have imperfect superpowers that must cooperate {{with each other to}} resolve any incidents that arise. Maeda originally submitted three separate ideas for a story to Toba, and he asked him which one he liked best. However, after Toba pointed out one of the other two, Maeda {{made it clear that he}} wanted to do the story that would become Charlotte. When writing the story, Maeda also reconsidered how he had done <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> with Angel Beats!. In particular, he attempted to put more of a focus on the behavior of the characters. Maeda also narrowed down the number of main characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats!, which could not put a focus on each and every character. Toba felt that Maeda was influenced by his work on Angel Beats!, which changed his thought process and what he wanted to depict in Charlotte.|$|E

50|$|Breach can {{be shown}} in most jurisdictions if a {{defendant}} violates a custom that is widespread and itself reasonable. For example, where ten percent of a certain industry does a <b>certain</b> <b>thing,</b> it probably will {{not be considered a}} custom for purposes of breach in negligence. Alternatively, if 90 percent of a certain industry does a <b>certain</b> <b>thing,</b> but the thing is inherently unsafe, and it is upholding the custom as a cost-saving measure, violation of that custom (doing something safer) will not constitute breach. As with violation of statute, this is an alternative way to show breach. Therefore, just because it cannot be shown, or is attempted to be shown but fails, does not mean that there has been no breach. There may be other ways of showing breach.|$|R
25|$|When McCain {{was running}} for {{president}} in 2000, he supported the normalizing of relations with Cuba, even if Fidel Castro remained in power, provided that the Cuban government did <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> to democratize Cuba. McCain compared the situation to normalizing relations with Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|For a {{woman to}} conceive, <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> have to happen: vaginal {{intercourse}} must take place around the time when an egg is released from her ovary; the system that produces eggs has to be working at optimum levels; and her hormones must be balanced.|$|E
25|$|Social {{conservatives are}} {{sometimes}} opposed to such events because they view {{them to be}} contrary to public morality. This belief is partly based on <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> often found in the parades, such as public nudity, BDSM paraphernalia, and other sexualized features. Within the academic community, there has been criticism that the parades actually set to strengthen homosexual-heterosexual divides and increase essentialist views.|$|E

25|$|Regardless {{of these}} {{different}} methods, all house divisions in Western astrology share <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> in common: the twelve house cusps are always projected on the ecliptic; they will all place the cusp of the first house near the eastern horizon and every house cusp is 180° of longitude apart from the sixth following house (1st opposes 7th; 2nd opposes 8th and so on).|$|E
25|$|While some {{cultures}} {{considered the}} knowledge of the dead to be unlimited, ancient Greeks and Romans believed that individual shades knew only <b>certain</b> <b>things.</b> The apparent value of their counsel may have been based on things they knew in life or knowledge they acquired after death. Ovid writes in his Metamorphoses of a marketplace in the underworld where the dead convene to exchange news and gossip.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} to prevent the schema from being inconsistent by restricting which formulae it can be applied to, such as only stratified formulae in New Foundations (see below) or only positive formulae (formulae with only conjunction, disjunction, quantification and atomic formulae) in positive set theory. These however typically aren't able to express <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> that most theories can, for instance, there is no complement or relative complement in positive set theory.|$|E

Prophetic tradition narrates that [...] "Anybody who called a child {{saying that he}} {{would give him a}} <b>certain</b> <b>thing,</b> and did not give it, then it is a lie" [...] (Ahmed).

25|$|One player {{told his}} {{teammates}} {{that there were}} <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> contained in the contracts that needed clarification. He was summoned back into Bvute's office and warned {{that it was a}} take-it-or-leave-it offer: this player was later revealed to be Anthony Ireland. Another said that when he told Bvute he wanted to consult with friends, Bvute {{picked up the phone and}} called Kenyon Ziehl, the head of selection, and told him he wanted the player replaced in the squad. Unsurprisingly, the player backed down and signed.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} from irreducible complexity is {{a descendant of}} the teleological argument for God (the {{argument from}} design or from complexity). This states that because <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> in nature appear very complicated, {{they must have been}} designed. William Paley famously argued, in his 1802 watchmaker analogy, that complexity in nature implies a God {{for the same reason that}} the existence of a watch implies the existence of a watchmaker. This argument has a long history, and one can trace it back at least as far as Cicero's De Natura Deorum ii.34, written in 45 BC.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said by some that I asked for too much. Perhaps so. You tell me -- what quality of {{leadership}} would ask too little? What sort of leadership would be content merely to maintain a standard of living that for so long has been so meager for so many? The shame upon me and my administration {{would have been in}} not struggling for something better. Today, I am not ashamed..... The most meaningful measurement of progress is that <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> are no longer acceptable to us as a people.|$|E

This value is the inverse of the producer's accuracy, i.e. Omission Error = 1 - producer's accuracy ...|$|R
