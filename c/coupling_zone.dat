The governing equations for plasma flow, electric and magnetic fields are solved in a Cartesian coordinate system with suitable domain size and appropriate boundary conditions.

Results over the current range of 300 A - 900 A suggest that the two arc columns attached respectively to anode and cathode are coupled by a thin tissue-like conducting layer with a thickness {{in the range of}} 3 - 6 mm, serving as a critical part of the current path.

40|$|Glass {{formation}} is basically to avoid nucleation upon quenching. However, {{the growth of}} each nucleus is also important as certain undercooling is needed. Thus the subsequent competition between the growth of crystalline phases {{and the formation of}} amorphous phase should be considered. In this paper, we summarized our recent studies in Pd-Ni-Cu-P system and La-Cu-Ni-Al alloy systems. It is concluded that the glass forming ability of a eutectic alloy system depends on the type of the eutectics, i. e. symmetric or asymmetric eutectic <b>coupled</b> <b>zone.</b> For the alloy systems with symmetric eutectic <b>coupled</b> <b>zone,</b> the best glass forming alloys should be at or very close to the eutectic composition.

30|$|The {{distribution}} of interplate earthquakes reflects the seismic coupling along the plate interface in subduction zones (e.g. Kanamori, 1971; Kelleher et al., 1974; Ruff and Kanamori, 1980, 1983; Kato and Seno, 2003). The downdip limit of interplate earthquakes, i.e., the maximum {{depth of the}} seismically <b>coupled</b> <b>zone,</b> is where the transition from seismic (stick-slip) to aseismic (stable-sliding) behavior occurs along the plate interface, and this limit presumably correlates with transitions in mineral and physical properties along the plate interface as well (e.g., Pacheco et al., 1993; Hyndman et al., 1995; Scholz, 1998; Oleskevich et al., 1999).

40|$|The {{historic}} {{record of}} large megathrust earthquakes {{suggests that the}} potential for great destructive events is much larger for Sumatra than Java. Bouguer gravity anomalies correlate well with the occurrence of large megathrust earthquakes in the Sunda subduction zone; negative anomalies mark segments characterized by larger earthquakes while positive anomalies indicate lower seismic potential. Thermal models and structural constraints derived from seismic and gravity data are used to explain the seismogenic behaviour in the Sunda subduction zone. With respect to Java, oblique subduction of young oceanic crust shifts the seismogenic <b>coupling</b> <b>zone</b> roughly 40 km trenchward offshore of northern Sumatra and increases {{the width of the}} locked megathrust. A prominent positive gravity anomaly offshore of Java is caused by a shallow mantle wedge underlying the forearc basin.

40|$|This {{sample is}} a casting alloy of {{eutectic}} composition. From the melt a eutectic is formed between aluminium solid solution and virtually pure silicon. Slow solidification produces a very coarse microstructure. The eutectic comprises large plates of silicon in the aluminium matrix. This microstructure displays poor ductility {{due to the}} brittleness of large silicon plates. The microstructure is normally refined through either rapid solidification, which lets the silicon phase assume a fibrous form, or by {{a process known as}} modification. It may be noted that primary aluminium dendrites can be seen, although the composition is very close to the eutectic point and an entirely eutectic microstructure might thus have been expected. This effect is a consequence of the strongly skewed nature of the eutectic "coupled zone" in the Al-Si system. The <b>coupled</b> <b>zone</b> represents the combinations of melt composition and interfacial undercooling (or growth velocity) for which (coupled) eutectic growth can occur. It can be plotted on the phase diagram by extending the two liquidus lines below the eutectic temperature. The Si liquidus line curves sharply back towards higher Si contents as the undercooling is increased. (This is associated with the facetted growth mode of the Si phase.) Thus, depending on growth conditions, a nominally eutectic alloy may solidify initially outside the <b>coupled</b> <b>zone,</b> leading to primary aluminium dendrite formation (before the melt composition rises sufficiently for the <b>coupled</b> <b>zone</b> to be entered and eutectic growth to occur).

30|$|Our seismic {{data may}} provide another {{important}} constraint on the frictional property along the plate interface, since the seismic structure is closely correlated to interplate coupling (e.g., Fujie et al. 2013). In the easternmost Nankai subduction <b>zone,</b> a strongly <b>coupled</b> <b>zone</b> is outlined by geodetic measurements (Sagiya 1999; Suito and Ozawa 2009). The estimated slip deficit rate of > 20 mm/year, almost {{equivalent to the}} convergence rate between the overriding and subducting plates, implies that strain is being steadily accumulated at the contact, and will probably lead to coseismic rupture during a megathrust earthquake (Ando 1975). Our seismic lines in the north–south direction cross the transitional boundary between a strongly <b>coupled</b> <b>zone</b> and a weakly <b>coupled</b> <b>zone</b> along the plate boundary. The reflective zones we found are likely located close to the down-dip end of this locked zone (Fig.  4 b). This spatial correlation may suggest that the reflective zone delimits the down-dip end of the coseismic rupture zone. Similar spatial patterns of seismic reflectivity (a shallow coseismic region with low reflectivity and a deeper aseismic region with relatively high reflectivity) are also observed {{in other areas of}} the Nankai subduction zone (Kodaira et al. 2002, 2004; Iidaka et al. 2004). In the Tokai region further west of this study, Kodaira et al. (2004) correlated this reflective zone with the distribution of slow slips, and suggested that high-pressure fluids supplied by hydrous minerals within the slab effectively extend a region of stable slips, and consequently generate the slow slip. Changing fluid pressures and the resulting frictional properties in the down-dip direction probably control the transition from a coseismic rupture zone to a deeper aseismic zone.|$|R

The efficiency and feasibility of the SMM are demonstrated by computing elec-tromagnetic scattering of some kinds of shapes such as a cone-sphere with a gap, a bi-arc column and a stealth aircraft configuration. The numerical results show that: (1) the accuracy of SMM is satisfied, as compared with MOM, and the computational time it spends is only about 8 % of the MOM; (2) with the electrical space considered, making another allowance for the surface curvature can reduce the computation time by 9. 5 %...|$|E

40|$|The Arlequin {{method is}} {{employed}} to combine beam elements based on different kinematic assumptions. Refined models are assumed only in those zones with a quasi-three-dimensional stress field reducing the computational costs. Variable kinematics beam elements are formulated {{on the basis}} of a Unified Formulation (UF). A N-order polynomials approximation is assumed on the beam cross-section for the unknown displacements, being N a free parameter of the formulation. Several hierarchical finite elements can be formulated. This formulation is extended to the Arlequin method to derive matrices related to the <b>coupling</b> <b>zones</b> between high and low order kinematic beam theories. Results are assessed towards Navier-type analytical models and three-dimensional finite element solutions. Numerical investigation have proved that Arlequin method in the context of a hierarchical formulation effectively couples subdomains having different order finite elements without loss of accuracy and reducing the computational cos...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} {{responses of}} two dwellings in Sydney were monitored {{over the period}} of a year and compared to the outputs of two building energy simulation (BES) programs, AccuRate and EnergyPlus. The two programs achieved very similar outputs of zone temperatures when similar inputs and assumptions were made, {{with the exception of}} modelling roof cavities and ground <b>coupled</b> <b>zones.</b> In comparison to the measured response of the dwellings, discrepancies occurred between the measured and simulated results from both BES programs for roof cavity zones, whilst AccuRate also showed discrepancies for ground <b>coupled</b> <b>zones</b> and between the utilisation of the natural ventilation models. This thesis also presents findings from a comparative study investigating the useability of mathematical models to estimate global, direct and diffuse irradiance for 4 locations across Australia. No single model was consistently found to outperform the other models at estimating diffuse and direct irradiance, whilst the 6 variable Seo and Huang model achieved the best estimates of global irradiance. In particular, the diffuse/direct models lacked the ability to accurately estimate the diffuse fraction under clear sky conditions, whilst improvements in modelling global irradiance were possible if the modelled results were scaled to match the daily level of satellite derived insolation reported by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). The worst estimates of global irradiance resulted from the Zhang and Huang model which is incorporated in EnergyPlus auxiliary weather generator program. To test the usability of the irradiance models, a comparison of the simulation outputs of a simple building was undertaken varying only the inputs of horizontal irradiance. The results indicated that the bias and uncertainty of the simulation outputs were low when global irradiance was known and only diffuse and direct irradiance were estimated. However, when global irradiance was unknown the level of bias and uncertainty increased significantly. Again the irradiance data generated via EnergyPlus auxiliary weather generator program achieved the worst results...|$|R
40|$|Niobium-platinum {{samples of}} {{compositions}} ranging from 16 to 32 at. pct have been undercooled {{to as much}} as 540 K in the low gravity, containerless environment of a 105 meter drop tube. Undercooling was terminated in the Nb-Pt samples by the nucleation and growth of the Nb 3 Pt phase. In the 16 - 18 at. pct Pt samples, this resulted in samples which are completely Nb 3 Pt, in contrast to both the equilibrium phase diagram and the nonundercooled samples which formed with Nb dendrites and interdendritic Nb 3 Pt. Undercoolings for the Nb-Si samples were up to 670 K, which corresponds to 27 percent of the liquidus temperature or 80 percent of the estimated hypercooling limit. In the Nb-Si system, a <b>coupled</b> <b>zone</b> was identified as well as a metastable extension of the solubility limit of Si in Nb due to deep undercooling...|$|R
