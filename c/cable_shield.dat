The relative error is determined by comparing numerical calculation of magnetic field obtained in the COMSOL Multiphysics software with the analytical one.

Developed the technique of numerical simulation and calculation of the MF of CL based on its axisymmetric calculation model using the finite element method that allowed to describe the condition of closing the <b>cable</b> <b>shields</b> at the both ends of the CL and solve the problem in two-dimensional formulation.

50|$|Signal leakage is {{the passage}} of {{electromagnetic}} fields through the shield of a cable and occurs in both directions. Ingress is {{the passage of}} an outside signal into the cable and can result in noise and disruption of the desired signal. Egress is the passage of signal intended to remain within the cable into {{the outside world and}} can result in a weaker signal {{at the end of the}} cable and radio frequency interference to nearby devices. Severe leakage usually results from improperly installed connectors or faults in the <b>cable</b> <b>shield.</b>|$|E

It has disadvantage in high frequency systems, where it leads to impedance mismatch and leakage of the signal onto the shield, where it's subsequently radiated, or, symmetrically through the same mechanism, external signal is received by the shield and mixed into the desired signal.|$|E

When phantom powering was introduced, one of its advantages was that the same type of balanced, shielded microphone cable that studios were already using for dynamic microphones could be used for condenser microphones.

50|$|Cable {{shielding}} may {{be required}} in order to improve a Cat 6 cable's performance in high electromagnetic interference (EMI) environments. This shielding reduces the corrupting effect of EMI on the cable's data. Shielding is typically maintained from one cable end to the other using a drain wire that runs through the cable alongside the twisted pairs. The shield's electrical connection to the chassis on each end is made through the jacks. The requirement for ground connections at both cable ends creates the possibility that a ground loop may result if one of the networked chassis is at different instantaneous electrical potential with respect to its mate. This undesirable situation may compel currents to flow between chassis through the network <b>cable</b> <b>shield,</b> and these currents may in turn induce detrimental noise in the signal being carried by the cable.|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{power cables}} with Cross-Linked Polyethylene Insulation (XLPE-insulation) are {{currently}} utilized in projects of the electric-power supply systems of modern facilities. However, the higher costs, the incomplete design, {{installation and maintenance}} normativetechnical basis as well as certain constructional features of the XLPE-insulated cable lines hinder their large-scale implementation. The cables with XLPE insulation are mostly produced in a single-conductor core version being provided with a composite copper shield whose cross-section may vary while the electric conductor cross-section remains uniform. Earthing the <b>cable</b> <b>shields</b> on both sides causes the flow of electricity in them. The course of operational service of the XLPE-insulated cable lines revealed the following fact – the currents induced in the <b>cable</b> <b>shields</b> can run up to the levels commeasurable {{with those in the}} conductor-cores themselves. That, in its turn, leads to electrical safety-level reduction, cable lines failure, and economic losses. The currents induced in the shields may occur both in symmetric (normal and emergency) and asymmetric operating modes of the power grid with values of the induced currents reaching 80 % of the conducting core currents. Many factors affect the level of the current induced in the shield: the midpoint conductor modes, the values of the core longitudinal currents in the normal and emergency operating modes, failure mode, the cross-section area of the <b>shield,</b> the <b>cables</b> mutual disposition, and the distance between them. The paper claims experimental existence conformation of the cable-shield current induced by that in the conductor-core and demonstrates its measured value. The author establishes that induction of dangerous currents in the <b>cable</b> <b>shields</b> demands elaboration of measures on reducing their level. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Due to the {{relatively}} high signal voltages used in SCART, [...] "hot plugging" [...] (connecting or disconnecting devices while they are on) is not recommended. Although there is no risk of personal injury, {{there is the possibility}} of damaging electronics within the devices if the connector is inserted improperly. Also, since many TVs are Class II (double-insulated) rather than earthed, the large exposed shield on the SCART connector will be held at approximately half mains voltage if it is plugged into a powered TV with the other end unplugged. If the cable is then plugged into an earthed device with a metal case, inadvertent contact with the SCART <b>cable</b> <b>shield</b> while the earthed device is touched with the other hand can cause a painful electric shock.
