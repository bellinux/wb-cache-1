However, such bacteria were identified as Chlamydia trachomatis biovar LGV serovar L 2 by PCR sequencing techniques. Pathological examination of tissue biopsies was compatible with either lymphogranuloma venereum or cat scratch disease. The shell vial system is suitable for isolation of intracellular pathogens responsible for <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphadenopathies,</b> including C. trachomatis, Bartonella species, Francisella tularensis, and mycobacteria.

Results: The total number of patients was 120. Echogenic thin layer and strong internal echoes were specific for tuberculosis. Long axis to short axis (L/S) ratio was more than 2 {{in most of the}} tubercular nodes (85. 71 %).

In vitro experiments have shown that B. quintana survives within endothelial cells and stimulates cell proliferation. These observations, together with the finding that lesions may regress when antibiotic therapy is administered, strongly suggest that B. quintana itself stimulates angiogenesis. Bartonella infections are characterized by a high frequency of relapses after brief courses of antibiotic therapy. It is to be noted that in vitro, although Bartonella species are highly susceptible to antibiotics, only the aminoglycosides have proved to be bactericidal.

Thirty-one out of 69 extracts (45. 6 %) positive with REP- 529 qPCR were not amplified with the B 1 qPCR (relative sensitivity 54. 4 %, compared to REP- 529), yielding false negative results on 15 / 28 placentas, 5 cord blood, 2 amniotic fluids, 4 cerebrospinal fluids, 1 aqueous humor, 2 lymph node punctures and 1 abortion product.

40|$|Purpose: To {{define the}} {{clinical}} and laboratory findings of lymphadenopathy (LAP) resulting from benign and malignant causes during childhood. Material and Methods: 224 {{patients who were}} admitted to the clinic with peripheral lymphadenopathy were evaluated. Patient age, gender, laboratory and radiologic results, final diagnoses, and duration, localization, size, consistency, spread, and accompanying local and systemic symptoms of lymphadenopathy were determined. Lymphadenopathy in patients with benign and malignant causes were compared. Results: One hundred twenty-six of 224 patients (56. 0 %) were male and 98 (44. 0 %) were female. The analysis comprised 224 patients divided into 2 groups. The first group included 186 patients with benign causes and the second group included 38 patients with malignant causes. The most frequent cause of local lymphadenopathy in the benign group was acute lymphadenitis (34. 8 %), {{the most common cause}} in the malignant group was Hodgkin's lymphoma (4. 3 %). The most significant cause of general lymphadenopathy in the benign group was EBV (10. 0 %), whereas Hodgkin's lymphoma (23. 3 %) was most influential in malignant cases The results revealed that findings, such as chronic course, general lymphadenopathy, supraclavicular and cervical location, organomegaly, abdominal lymphadenopathy, weight loss, constitutional symptoms (night sweats or fatigue, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leucopenia) were associated with malignant diseases. Conclusion: Infections are {{the most common cause of}} lymphadenopathy among benign diseases. Malignant causes and tuberculosis should be considered in older patients, <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> general lymphadenopathy, associated organomegaly, abnormal laboratory findings, and the presence of constitutional symptoms.

There is increased evidence of association between CLL and skin cancers, including the uncommon Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Case presentation A case report of an 84 -year old male, who presented with an aggressively recurrent form of MCC on the lower lip, on the background of an 8 -year history of untreated CLL. During the recurrences of MCC, coexisting regional lymphadenopathy, posed {{a problem in the}} differential diagnosis and treatment of lymph node involvement. Histopathology and immunoistochemistry showed that submandibular lymphadenopathy coexisting with the second recurrence of MCC, was due to B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma. The subsequent and more aggressive recurrence of the skin tumor had involved the superficial and deep cervical lymph nodes. Surgical excision followed by involved field radiation therapy has been proven effective for both malignancies. Conclusion MCC has a high incidence of regional lymphadenopathy at presentation (12 – 45 %) and even when it arises on the background of <b>chronic</b> leucemia, <b>lymphadenopathy</b> at presentation should be managed agressively with elective lymph node dissection.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the etiology of}} bloodstream infections (BSIs) in hospitalized patients> 15 years old in Thailand, prospectively enrolled, consecutive febrile (> 387 C) patients were ad-mitted to one hospital during February±April 1997. After a patient history was taken and a physical examination was performed, blood was obtained for comprehensive culture and human immunode®ciency virus (HIV) testing. Of 246 study patients, 119 (48 %) had BSIs, and 182 (74 %) were infected with HIV. The 2 most common pathogens were Cryptococcus neo-formans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (30 and 27 patients, respectively). HIV-positive pa-tients {{were more likely than}} HIV-negative patients to have mycobacteremia (57 / 182 vs. 0 / 64,), fungemia (38 / 182 vs. 2 / 64,), or polymicrobial BSIs (19 / 182 vs. 0 / 64,P!. 0001 P!. 001 P!). Clinical predictors of BSIs included HIV infection, <b>chronic</b> diarrhea, <b>lymphadenopathy,.</b> 002 or splenomegaly. Mortality was higher among patients with than those without BSIs (P!). Cohort-based microbiologic studies are critically important to diagnose emerging path-. 001 ogens and to develop algorithms for empirical treatment of BSIs in developing countries. The etiology of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in febrile hos-pitalized adult (> 15 years old) patients in Southeast Asia re-mains unclear. In Thailand, the incidence and prevalence rates of Cryptococcus neoformans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium avium complex BSIs remain largely unknow...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in {{the genes}} that encode Fas or Fas ligand (FasL) can result in poor {{restraints}} on lymphocyte activation and in in-creased susceptibility to autoimmune disorders. Because these mutations portend a continuously activated immune state, we hypothesized that they might in some cases confer resistance to infection. To examine this possibility, the immune response to, morbidity caused by, and clearance of vaccinia virus (VACV) Western Reserve was examined in 5 - to 7 -week-old Fas mutant (lpr) mice, before an overt lymphoproliferative disorder was observable. On day 6 after VACV infection, C 57 BL/ 6 -lpr (B 6 -lpr) mice had decreased morbidity, decreased viral titers, and an increased percentage and number of CD 4 and CD 8 T cells. As early as day 2 after infection, B 6 -lprmice had decreased liver and spleen viral titers and increased numbers of and increased gamma in-terferon (IFN-) production by several different effector cell populations. Depletion of individual effector cell subsets did not inhibit the resistance of B 6 -lprmice. Uninfected B 6 -lprmice also had increased numbers of NK cells, T cells, and CD 44 CD 4 and CD 44 CD 8 T cells compared to uninfected B 6 mice. Antibody to IFN- resulted in increased virus load in both B 6 and B 6 -lprmice and eliminated the differences in viral titers between them. These results suggest that IFN- produced by multi-ple activated leukocyte populations in Fas-deficient hosts enhances resistance to some viral infections. Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a ge-netic disorder characterized by a <b>chronic</b> nonmalignant <b>lymphadenopathy</b> and/or splenomegaly, increased relative per-centages of CD 3 TCRCD 4 CD 8 (double-negative [DN]...|$|R
