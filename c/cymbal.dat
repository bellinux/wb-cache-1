5|$|Jack White's {{voice is}} a singular, evocative {{combination}} of punk, metal, blues, and backwoods while his guitar work is grand and banging with just enough lyrical touches of slide and subtle solo work... Meg White balances out the fretwork and the fretting with methodical, spare, and booming <b>cymbal,</b> bass drum, and snare... All D.I.Y. punk-country-blues-metal singer-songwriting duos should sound this good.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrumental}} scoring is for flute (doubling alto flute), oboe (doubling cor anglais), 2 clarinets (one doubling bass clarinet), horn, trumpet, trombone, one percussionist, harp, piano (doubling celeste), violin, 2 violas, 2 cellos {{and double}} bass.

5|$|At (1:18), the song's main melody is introduced, {{played by}} a guitar, the bass guitar and a glockenspiel, with a chord {{progression}} of E minor, C major seventh, G major, and D major. This is repeated until (3:28), when the guitars fade out into the background, and the drumbeat ends, leaving only the ride <b>cymbal</b> to keep the beat, and the main melody, which is repeated until it gradually fades out, leaving ambient guitar noise.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage show {{had become more}} predictable, with {{previously}} random shockers being done {{at the same point}} in each night's performance. Teresa Nervosa quit for good around the same time, and King Coffey became the band's sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning <b>cymbal</b> are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a {{second-hand}} drum kit {{consisting of}} a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift <b>cymbal</b> fashioned from a rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, {{who went on to}} book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.|$|E
5000|$|... "Alchemy Cymbals" [...] is a {{brand of}} hand-made <b>cymbals</b> {{belonging}} to Istanbul Agop; the brand has its own production line. The main difference between Istanbul Agop and Alchemy <b>Cymbals</b> is the finishing process, which gives Alchemy <b>Cymbals</b> a brighter look and a distinct sound. Alchemy <b>Cymbals</b> also has low-cost <b>cymbals</b> in its production line for beginners and semi-professionals.|$|R
50|$|In general, truly hand {{hammered}} <b>cymbals</b> {{tend to have}} darker, lower, richer tones, {{and there}} tends {{to be far more}} variation in character between <b>cymbals</b> of supposedly identical models.

50|$|Paiste {{also offers}} to color coat their <b>cymbals</b> and the {{possibility}} of custom orders. They also use prototype <b>cymbals</b> that sometimes appear in stores. So there are Paiste <b>cymbals</b> 'outside' of the here mentioned series. Most of these <b>cymbals</b> were never manufactured fully.|$|R
5|$|The 808 was {{followed}} in 1983 by the TR-909, the first Roland drum machine to use samples (for its <b>cymbal</b> and hi-hat sounds) alongside analog sounds. In the 1990s, Roland included {{samples of the}} 808 in its successful Groovebox devices. In February 2014, Roland announced the TR-8 drum machine, which recreates the 808 and 909 {{through a combination of}} modeling and sampling. In August 2017, Roland announced the TR-08, a miniaturized 808 reissue with features including an LED display, MIDI and USB connections, expanded sequencer control, and a built-in speaker.|$|E
5|$|The team's cheerleaders are the Carolina Topcats, a {{group of}} 24 women who lead cheers and {{entertain}} fans at home games. The TopCats participate in both corporate and charity events. The team's drumline is PurrCussion, an ensemble of snare, tenor, and bass drummers as well as <b>cymbal</b> players. PurrCussion performs for fans outside the stadium and introduces players prior to home games; it consists of drummers from across the Carolinas.|$|E
5|$|This is {{repeated}} until (2:32), when the drumbeat gradually fades out, {{leaving only the}} ride <b>cymbal</b> keeping the beat, and the guitars, which repeat a melody based around the chord of A major, using harmonics. At (3:11), the bass guitar joins in, followed by the drum kit, building to a gradual crescendo, eventually climaxing at (3:42) into a distortion-laden chord progression, using the chords Fâ™¯ minor, D major, and A major. At (3:46), a guitar solo is played over these chords. This continues until (5:09), after all instruments have faded out except for the tremolo-laden feedback of the guitar.|$|E

5|$|At 0:35, {{the camera}} {{cuts to the}} {{aftermath}} of The Shot. A young man jumps {{in the air and}} pumps his fist as another young man in an opposing jersey sinks to the floor. The moment is from the 1989 NBA Playoffs, when Jordan hit a game-winning jump shot over Cleveland Cavaliers guard Craig Ehlo. At 0:38 is Jordan's last shot with the Chicago Bulls, after a crossover dribble past Utah Jazz guard Bryon Russell at the end of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. These scenes are musically punctuated with a bass drum roll and a <b>cymbal</b> crash. Finally, at 0:44 a young man shrugs after hitting a shot, as Jordan shrugged after scoring six three-point field goals {{in the first half of}} Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E
5|$|Moon {{grew up in}} Alperton, {{a suburb}} of Wembley, in Middlesex, and took up the drums during the early 1960s. After playing with a local band, the Beachcombers, he joined the Who in 1964 before they {{recorded}} their first single. Moon remained with the band during their rise to fame, and was quickly recognised for his drumming style, which emphasised tom-toms, <b>cymbal</b> crashes, and drum fills. He occasionally collaborated with other musicians and later appeared in films, but considered playing in the Who his primary occupation and remained {{a member of the}} band until his death. In addition to his talent as a drummer, however, Moon developed a reputation for smashing his kit on stage and destroying hotel rooms on tour. He was fascinated by blowing up toilets with cherry bombs or dynamite, and by destroying television sets. Moon enjoyed touring and socialising, and was bored and restless when the Who were inactive. His 21st birthday party in Flint, Michigan, has been cited as a notorious example of decadent behaviour by rock groups.|$|E
25|$|Some {{maintain}} that the term nickel silver should only be used for alloys containing an appreciable content of zinc, and would call this <b>cymbal</b> alloy nickel bronze instead, {{but the use of}} the term nickel silver for all <b>cymbal</b> bronzes with nickel as the main alloying metal is well established.|$|E

25|$|All cymbals {{other than}} rides, hi-hats and crashes/splashes are usually called effects cymbals {{when used in}} a drum kit, though this is a non-classical or colloquial {{designation}} {{that has become a}} standardized label. Most extended kits include one or more splash cymbals and at least one china <b>cymbal.</b> Major <b>cymbal</b> makers produce <b>cymbal</b> extension packs consisting of one splash and one china, or more rarely a second crash, a splash and a china, to match some of their starter packs of ride, crash and hi-hats.

25|$|Most five-piece kits, at {{more than}} entry level, also have one or more effects cymbals. Adding cymbals beyond the basic ride, hi-hats and one crash {{configuration}} requires more stands {{in addition to the}} standard drum hardware packs. Because of this, many higher-cost kits for professionals are sold with little or even no hardware, to allow the drummer to choose the stands and also the bass drum pedal he/she prefers. At the other extreme, many inexpensive, entry-level kits are sold as a five-piece kit complete with two <b>cymbal</b> stands, most often one straight and one boom, and some even with a standard <b>cymbal</b> pack, a stool and a pair of 5A drum sticks. In the 2010s, digital kits are often offered in a five-piece kit, usually with one plastic crash <b>cymbal</b> triggers and one ride <b>cymbal</b> trigger. Fully electronic drums do not produce any acoustic sound beyond the quiet tapping of sticks on the plastic or rubber heads. The trigger-pads are wired up to a synth module or sampler.|$|E
