25|$|Bellarmine {{found no}} problem with heliocentrism {{so long as it}} was treated as a purely {{hypothetical}} <b>calculating</b> <b>device</b> and not as a physically real phenomenon, but he did not regard it as permissible to advocate the latter unless it could be conclusively proved through current scientific standards. This put Galileo in a difficult position, because he believed that the available evidence strongly favoured heliocentrism, and he wished to be able to publish his arguments.|$|E
25|$|In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of Iowa State University {{developed}} and tested the Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC) in 1942, the first electronic digital <b>calculating</b> <b>device.</b> This design was also all-electronic, and used about 300 vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory. However, its paper card writer/reader was unreliable, {{and work on}} the machine was discontinued. The machine's special-purpose nature and lack of a changeable, stored program distinguish it from modern computers.|$|E
25|$|Since real numbers can be {{represented}} as distances or intervals on a line, the slide rule was invented in the 1620s, shortly after Napier's work, to allow multiplication and division operations {{to be carried out}} significantly faster than was previously possible. Edmund Gunter built a <b>calculating</b> <b>device</b> with a single logarithmic scale at the University of Oxford. His device greatly simplified arithmetic calculations, including multiplication and division. William Oughtred greatly improved this in 1630 with his circular slide rule. He followed this up with the modern slide rule in 1632, essentially a combination of two Gunter rules, held together with the hands. Slide rules were used by generations of engineers and other mathematically involved professional workers, until the invention of the pocket calculator.|$|E

2500|$|The {{names of}} the {{components}} of the <b>calculating</b> <b>device</b> were borrowed from the textile industry. In the textile industry, yarn was brought from the store to be milled. The device would have had a [...] "store"—memory to hold 1,000 numbers of 40 decimal digits each. [...] Numbers from the [...] "store" [...] would then have then been transferred to the [...] "mill" [...] (analogous to the CPU of a modern machine), for processing. It was programmed using two sets of perforated cards—one to direct the operation and the other for the input variables.|$|E
2500|$|The Dumaresq was a {{mechanical}} <b>calculating</b> <b>device</b> invented around 1902 by Lieutenant John Dumaresq of the Royal Navy. [...] It was an analog computer which related vital variables {{of the fire}} control problem to the movement of one's own ship and that of a target ship. [...] It was often used with other devices, such as a Vickers range clock to generate range and deflection data so the gun sights of the ship could be continuously set. A number of versions of the Dumaresq were produced of increasing complexity as development proceeded.|$|E

In 1592 Magini published Tabula tetragonica, and in 1606 devised extremely accurate trigonometric tables. He also worked on the geometry of the sphere and applications of trigonometry, for which he invented <b>calculating</b> <b>devices.</b> He also worked {{on the problem of}} mirrors and published on the theory of concave spherical mirrors.|$|R
2500|$|Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, one of {{the most}} {{respected}} Catholic theologians of the time, was called on to adjudicate the dispute between Galileo and his opponents. The question of heliocentrism had first been raised with Cardinal Bellarmine, in the case of Paolo Antonio Foscarini, a Carmelite father; Foscarini had published a book, Lettera ... sopra l'opinione ... del Copernico, which attempted to reconcile Copernicus with the biblical passages that seemed to be in contradiction. Bellarmine at first expressed the opinion that Copernicus's book would not be banned, but would at most require some editing so as to present the theory purely as a <b>calculating</b> <b>device</b> for [...] "saving the appearances" [...] (i.e. preserving the observable evidence).|$|E
