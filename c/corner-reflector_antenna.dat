40|$|In {{a recent}} report (ERA- 276) a method of {{protecting}} a VHF Yagi antenna from severe icing by enclosing it in a heated cubicle box was described. Measurement of impedance and radiation patters showed that the method was feasible. The suggestion was made that a <b>corner-reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> could be more easily enclosed in a box and would have substantially equivalent electrical performance. Subsequent measurements made on a <b>corner-reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> show that such an antenna, operating at the same frequency as the Yagi antenna, can be enclosed in a box of the same aperture with an estimated loss in performance relative {{to that of the}} Yagi antenna, of 1 to 12 db. The bandwidth, however, is approximately three times greater. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|A high-gain {{monolithic}} millimeter-wave antenna {{has been}} designed, fabricated, and tested at 222 GHz. The structure {{consists of a}} traveling-wave antenna integrated on a 1. 2 -micron dielectric membrane and suspended in a longitudinal cavity etched in a silicon wafer. A new traveling-wave antenna design yields a wideband input impedance and a low cross-polarization component in the E- and quasi-H-plane patterns. A directivity of 17. 7 dB and a main-beam efficiency of 88. 5 percent are calculated from the 222 -GHz pattern measurements. The integrated <b>corner-reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> is well suited for millimeter- and submillimeter-wave imaging applications in large f-number systems...|$|E
40|$|The Canadian Armed Services have an R-F Signal Monitor Van which {{frequently}} {{operates in}} conjunction with a test aircraft. The Services requested aid from the National Research Council in developing a system to measure and record the range of this aircraft automatically. The new system uses surplus beacon components and a commercially available time-interval unit. A suitable <b>corner-reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> was designed and built by the National Research Council for the equipment. The maximum error of the finished system was found to lie between - 148 feet and + 49 feet, for all ranges from 700 feet to 200 nautical miles. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|A piecewise-sinusoidal {{reaction}} {{technique is}} {{proposed for the}} study of scattering and radiation from perfectly conducting bodies of arbitrary shape. The reaction technique described is a moment method based on the integral equation of an electric field. A theory of sinusoidal reaction formulation for radiation and scattering problems is outlined, in which the scattered field is obtained by integrating the surface currents. Numerical results are presented for the scattering patterns of rectangular plates and corner reflectors and the radiation patterns of <b>corner-reflector</b> <b>antennas...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} <b>corner-reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> {{has been}} designed, fabricated, and measured at millimeter-wave frequencies. The structure {{consists of a}} traveling-wave antenna integrated on a 1. 2 -micron dielectric membrane, and suspended in a longitudinal cavity etched in a silicon wafer. A novel traveling wave antenna design, the modified-bend antenna, with an antenna length of 1. 2 lambda and spacing 0. 96 lambda from the apex, results in a wideband input impedance centered at 140 Ohm and low cross-polarization levels. Measurements at 180 - 270 GHz show a well-defined pattern with low sidelobe levels, and a main-beam efficiency of 93 percent and 83 percent at 180 and 222 GHz, respectively. The monolithic approach allows the integration of a matching network and a Schottky-diode or SIS detector {{at the base of}} the antenna to yield a low-noise monolithic millimeter-wave receiver...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} an experimental investigation using scaled-model techniques {{for the purpose}} of obtaining information in the design of a model HF shipborne antenna pattern range. The physical arrangement consists of a rectangular conducting ground plane (basic dimensions: 30 inches wide and 46 inches long) on which is mounted a <b>corner-reflector</b> transmitting <b>antenna</b> and a quarter-wave-base-fed monopole receiving antenna located off-center on a small rotating circular disc. All measurements are carried out at a scaled frequency of 2160 megacycles per second. Results are included to show the effect of size of ground screen and other parameters on the circularity of the measured radiation patterns. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
