25|$|The UltraBattery is {{a hybrid}} {{rechargeable}} lead-acid battery and a supercapacitor invented by Australia's national science organisation CSIRO. Its cell construction contains a standard lead-acid battery positive electrode, standard sulphuric acid electrolyte and a specially prepared negative carbon-based electrode that store electrical energy with double-layer capacitance. The presence of the supercapacitor electrode alters the chemistry of the battery and affords it significant protection from sulfation in high rate partial state if charge use, which is the typical failure mode of valve regulated lead-acid cells used this way. The resulting cell performs with characteristics beyond either a lead-acid cell or a supercapacitor, with charge and discharge rates, <b>cycle</b> <b>life,</b> efficiency and performance all enhanced. UltraBattery has been installed in kW and MW scale applications in Australia, Japan and the U.S.A. in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing and other applications.|$|E

Each battery module {{is made of}} 6 individual 1.2V 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells in series forming a 7.2V 6.5Ah module with 46Wh/kg energy density and 1.3kW/kg output power density.

These modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6V 6.5Ah battery (traction battery), {{also known as the}} energy storage system. The computer controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38% and 82% state of charge, with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60%. By shallow cycling the battery {{only a small portion of}} its net available energy storage capacity is available for use (approximately 400Wh) by the hybrid drive system, but the shallow computer controlled cycling dramatically improves the <b>cycle</b> <b>life,</b> thermal management control, and net long term calendar life of the battery.

2500|$|The second {{generation}} Toyota Prius {{makes use of}} a 201.6-volt NiMH battery composed of 28 modules, where each module is made of six individual 1.2-volt, 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells. The 7.2-volt modules each contain a charge controller and a relay. The 28 modules are connected in series to produce a total energy storage capacity of 1.310kWh (via 201.6-volts × 6.5Ah). The battery control computers keep the state of charge (SOC) between approximately 40 and 80percent (shallow cycling), where the average SOC hovers around 60percent, allowing about 400Wh of useful energy storage to capture energy from regenerative braking and to release {{it back into the}} hybrid drive-train through Motor-generator 1 and Motor-generator 2 in the power split device. [...] The shallow cycling enables the hybrid battery to last tens of thousands of cycles, which translates into decades of use and in many case more than [...] of operation. The computer controlled charging and discharging of the battery enhances its <b>cycle</b> <b>life,</b> calendar life, and thermal control performance. Passive battery cooling and heating is accomplished through the metal case of the battery assembly pack, while a forced air cooling system with a blower motor and ducting system enables active cooling of the HV battery.|$|E
