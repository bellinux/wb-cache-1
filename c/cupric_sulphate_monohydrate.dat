Introduction. The investigation of NLO materials have gained predominant attention in current research owing to their applications in the technology of information transmission and processing. It is evident that the NLO crystals have exceptional technological requirements such as wide transparency range, fast response and high damage threshold. Due to such distinct optical properties, synthesis and growth of unique materials are in progress. The most widely used materials in photonic technologies are mainly inorganic crystals based on Borates and Phosphates. Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> Li 2 So 4 H 2 o (LSMH) is also one such inorganic highly NLO active materials [1 - 4]. The crystal structure and space group of Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> were originally determined as monoclinic point group P 21 by G. E. Ziegler (1934) [5]. A detailed study on the redetermination, further refinement and inclusion of hydrogen's position of Li 2 So 4 H 2 o structure were reported [6 - 8]. It is explored from the literature that the Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> has remarkable piezoelectric and electro-optic properties. Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> has highest pyroelectric effects among the non-ferroelectric polar crystals [9]. Earlier researches show that Lithium found to be effective NLO material on its combination with Selenate, Glycine and Bromide [10 - 12]. Since there is large demand for crystal in electronic industries, it is required to synthesize NLO material and to improve the properties of existing materials. Considering the facts, ethylene diamine tetra acetate and Cu II doped Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> single crystals have been synthesized and shown as promising candidate for optical second harmonic generation [13 - 14]. In the present work {{attempts have been made to}} enhance the physical properties of single crystals by incorporating bivalent metal dopant. The presence of very low concentration of suitable additives enhances crystalline perfection [14]. Therefore, we present the Synthesis of grown Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>monohydrate</b> single crystals containing 0. 1 mole percentage of Zinc Sulphate by slow evaporation method.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the process of}} the copper (II) <b>{{sulphate}}</b> <b>monohydrate</b> from copper (II) sulphate pentahydrate (also known as a Blue vitriol or Bluestone) production was analyzed. Copper (II) sulphate pentahydrate {{is one of the most}} important copper salts which has been known since the ancient Egyptians. In the nineteenth century its application as a fungicide was discovered which provoked wide industrial production. Molecule of the copper (II) sulphate pentahydrate is a crystalohydrate with five water molecules linked by chemical bonds to a molecule of the copper (II) sulphate. Copper (II) sulphate exists as a series of compounds that differ in their degree of hydratation. The anhydrous form is a pale green or gray-white powder, whereas the pentahydrate (CuSO 4 • 5 H 2 O), the most commonly encountered salt, is bright blue. In order to obtain copper (II) <b>sulphate</b> <b>monohydrate</b> from copper (II) sulphate pentahydrate four water molecules need to be removed. To determine the optimum temperature and time required for the removal of four water molecules from a molecule of pentahydrate in this work thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis was performed. Thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis - dehydration of copper (II) sulphate pentahydrate is done using simultaneous TG-DSC thermal analyzer DTG-Q 600 SDT from TA Instruments. Analyzes was carried out for two type of samples, the sample containing particles of the average diameter equal to 0. 17 mm and the particles of the average diameter 0. 5 mm.

To understand further the optical behaviour of (I) and (II), the crystal structures of both compounds were determined from accurate single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements performed at 100 K. The crystallographic studies revealed the key role of the intermolecular interactions and the molecular arrangements in the enhancement of the NLO properties...|$|R
40|$|Both diglycine {{sulphate}} (DGS) and diglycine <b>sulphate</b> <b>monohydrate</b> (DGS. H 2 O) {{are reported}} to crystallize from solution with pH < 1 (1, 2). DGS. H 2 O (point group 2 /m; Z = 4) shows a dielectric anomaly at 72 °C suggestive of antiferroelectric transition(1). The crystals obtained by us from solution with pH < 0. 5 at 20 - 25 °C were always DGS (point group mmm; Z = 8) as confirmed by X-ray studies. The measurement of its dielectric constant along [100], [010] and [001] did not indicate any phase transition in the range 5 - 400 °K. Thus DGS is a normal dielectric unlike TGS. The polarized Raman spectra and the infrared spectra were recorded to examine the configuration of glycine in DGS(3). The vibration spectra reveals that both the glycines in DGS exist as NH 3 +CH 2 COOH, thus precluding the hydrogen bond of the type N+-H…O- which exists between two glycine units in TGS. This {{seems to be a}} good reason for the difference in the dielectric behaviour of these two glycine sulphates...|$|R
40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is the leading}} cause of blindness in the Western world. AMD is a multifactorial disorder but complement-mediated inflammation at the level of the retina plays a pivotal role. Oral zinc supplementation can reduce the progression of AMD but the precise mechanism of this protective effect is as yet unclear. We investigated whether zinc supplementation directly affects the degree of complement activation in AMD and whether there is a relation between serum complement catabolism during zinc administration and the complement factor H (CFH) gene or the Age-Related Maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS 2) genotype. In this open-label clinical study, 72 randomly selected AMD patients in various stages of AMD received a daily supplement of 50 mg zinc sulphate and 1 mg <b>cupric</b> <b>sulphate</b> for three months. Serum complement catabolism–defined as the C 3 d/C 3 ratio–was measured at baseline, throughout the three months of supplementation and after discontinuation of zinc administration. Additionally, downstream inhibition of complement catabolism was evaluated by measurement of anaphylatoxin C 5 a. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of zinc on complement activation in vitro. AMD patients with high levels of complement catabolism at baseline exhibited a steepe...|$|R
40|$|Two- and three-compartment copper {{electrowinning}} (EW) cells {{based on}} reactive electrodialysis (RED) have been studied. The catholyte was <b>cupric</b> <b>sulphate</b> and the anolyte was ferrous sulphate, both dissolved in sulphuric acid. Copper mesh cathodes and graphite bar anodes have been used. The effects of cell current density, temperature, electrolyte recirculation flowrate and nitrogen sparging flowrate on cell performance (cathodic current efficiency, cell voltage and specific energy consumption (SEC)) have been determined. The cell voltage increased with cell current and it decreased with temperature and nitrogen sparging flowrate. The effect of nitrogen sparging flowrate {{on the cell}} voltage is stronger than the effect of electrolyte recirculation flowrate, whereas its enhancing effect on mass transfer is stronger than its deleterious effect on electrolyte conductivity. The SEC ranged from 0. 94 to 1. 39 kW h/kg at cell current densities between 200 and 600 A/m(2). These values are considerably better than those for conventional copper EW (about 2 kW h/kg at 350 A/m(2)). The morphology of the electrodeposits has been observed and a comparison between a three-compartment cell and a previously studied squirrel-cage cell (both based on RED) has been drawn...|$|R
40|$|Nonlinear optical single {{crystals}} of Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetate (EDTA) doped lithium <b>sulphate</b> <b>monohydrate</b> are successfully {{grown by}} using slow evaporation technique {{at room temperature}} with double distilled water as solvent. In order to know its suitability for device fabrication, different characterization analyses have been performed. The single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and powder X-ray diffraction methods are used for identifying the structural parameters of grown crystals. It is found that the addition of dopant doesn’t change the crystal structure. The range and percentage of optical transmission as well as absorption are ascertained by recording UV-Vis-NIR spectrum. No absorption in the entire visible region implies {{that it is a}} potential candidate for optoelectronic applications. The modes of vibration of different groups present in the crystals are identified by FT-IR technique. To understand the thermal properties, thermo gravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TGA & DTA) were carried out. The melting point was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis. The amount of dopant included into the crystals was estimated by colorimetric method. The second harmonic generation efficiency measured by Kurtz powder technique is 0. 53 times that of potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} obtain {{insights}} into the presence of cadmium, lead, mercury and arsenic in feed materials and feed over time {{for the purpose of}} guiding national monitoring. Data from the Dutch feed monitoring programme and from representatives of the feed industry during the period 2007 – 13 were used. Data covered a variety of feed materials and compound feeds in the Netherlands. Trends in the percentage of samples that exceeded the maximum limit (ML) set by the European Commission, and trends in average, median and 90 th percentile concentrations of each of these elements were investigated. Based on the results, monitoring should focus on feed material of mineral origin, feed material of marine origin, especially fish meal, seaweed and algae, as well as feed additives belonging to the functional groups of (1) trace elements (notably <b>cupric</b> <b>sulphate,</b> zinc oxide and manganese oxide for arsenic) and (2) binders and anti-caking agents. Mycotoxin binders are a new group of feed additives that also need attention. For complementary feed it is important to make a proper distinction between mineral and non-mineral feed (lower ML). Forage crops in general do not need high priority in monitoring programmes, although for arsenic grass meal still needs attention. </p...|$|R
