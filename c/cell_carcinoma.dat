5|$|Clear <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes}} up less than 5% of {{diagnosed}} endometrial cancer. Like serous <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> it is usually aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. Histologically, it {{is characterized by the}} features common to all clear cells: the eponymous clear cytoplasm when H stained and visible, distinct cell membranes. The p53 cell signaling system is not active in endometrial clear <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> This form of endometrial cancer is more common in postmenopausal women.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} studies, we {{investigated}} {{the correlation between}} RASSF 1 A promoter methylation status and Kras 2 mutations in 65 primary non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) including 33 adenocarcinomas, 12 large <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and 20 squamous <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Mutational analysis of Kras 2 showed: 30 % (10 of 33) of adenocarcinomas, 25 % (3 of 12) of large <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and only 5 % (1 of 20) of squamous <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> contained activated Kras 2 mutation at codon 12 or 13. RASSF 1 A promoter region CpG island methylation was detected in adenocarcinomas (55 %), large <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (25 %), and squamous <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (25 %). Interestingly, combined RASSF 1 A methylation and Kras 2 mutation data show that only ~ 7 % adenocarcinomas/large <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> exhibited both KRASSF 1 A promoter methylation and Kras 2 mutation, whereas 24 % adenocarcinomas, 50 % large <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and 70 % squamous <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> showed neither Kras 2 mutation nor RASSF 1 A promoter methylation. These {{results showed that the}} majority of the primary NSCLCs with Kras 2 mutations lack RASSF 1 A inactivation, and both RASSF 1 A inactivation and Kras 2 mutation events occur frequently in adenocarcinomas and large <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Our results indicate a trend of inverse relationship between Kras 2 activation and RASSF 1 A promoter methylation in the majority of human lung adenocarcinomas and large <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas...</b>|$|R

5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people with the disease range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and papillary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> If it develops in someone with BHD, renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid nodules {{have been}} {{associated}} with the Birt–Hogg–Dubé phenotype, present in 65% of individuals and 90% of families with the syndrome. However, a connection between BHD and thyroid cancer has not been substantiated. Other conditions have been reported to be associated but may not be caused by the mutation in FLCN or may not be related at all. These include multinodular goiter, medullary thyroid carcinoma, parotid oncocytoma, colonic polyposis, connective tissue nevus, lipomas, angiolipomas, parathyroid adenomas, flecked chorioretinopathy, neurothekeoma, meningiomas, angiofibromas of the face, trichoblastomas, cutaneous focal mucinosis, cutaneous leiomyoma, breast cancer, tonsillar cancer, colorectal cancer, sarcoma of the leg, lung cancer, melanoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> cutaneous leiomyosarcoma, and squamous <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma.</b>|$|E

40|$|The MiT {{family of}} translocation-associated renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> {{comprise}} approximately 40 [*]% of renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> in young patients but {{only up to}} 4 [*]% of renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> in adult patients. The Xp 11. 2 translocation-associated tumors are the most frequent and {{were included in the}} 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) classification. They contain a fusion of the TFE 3 gene with ASPSCR 1, PRCC, NONO, SPFQ or CLTC resulting in an immunohistochemically detectable nuclear overexpression of TFE 3. The Xp 11. 2 translocation-associated renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> are characterized by ample clear cytoplasm, papillary architecture and abundant psammoma bodies. The TFEB translocation-associated renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> are much rarer and show a biphasic architecture.

Aims: This study aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} topical {{photodynamic therapy}} in the treatment of superficial and nodular basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> in Asian patients treated at the National Skin Centre, Singapore. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of Asian patients with histologically confirmed basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and treated with photodynamic therapy was performed. Results: Eight Chinese patients, with an equal gender distribution and mean age of 83. 4 years were included. Five of eight basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were superficial while the remaining three were nodular. The basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were located in the head and neck in seven patients. The overall clearance rate at 3 months was 87. 5 % while the clearance rate for superficial and nodular basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> was 100 % and 66. 6 % respectively at 3 months. At 12 months, the overall clearance rate was 85. 7 %. Limitations: This is a retrospective analysis with small patient numbers. Conclusions: In this small series of eight Asian patients, topical photodynamic therapy has been shown to be effective and generally well-tolerated in the treatment of basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> particularly of the superficial subtype. However, larger studies are needed to evaluate its overall efficacy in Asian patients...|$|R
40|$|Basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> are {{the most}} common form of skin cancer. Tazarotene is a retinoic acid {{receptor}} selective retinoid that upregulates a tumor suppressor, tazarotene-induced gene 3 (TIG- 3), in keratinocytes and psoriasis. Expression of TIG- 3 in basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> was studied in an opened-label pilot biomarker study of 22 patients with basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> who applied tazarotene 0. 1 % gel for up to 12 wk prior to excision. Nineteen paired baseline and treated specimens were compared using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Compared to overlying normal epidermis, TIG- 3 protein and mRNA were decreased in 14 and 18 of 19 basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (74 % and 95 %), respectively (p< 0. 001). Tazarotene treatment was associated with increased TIG- 3 protein and mRNA expression in basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> compared to baseline levels (p≤ 0. 001 and p= 0. 028, respectively). Sixty percent of basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> treated with tazarotene decreased in size by at least 25 %. Ten of 19 lesions improved histologically, including three complete responses. There was a correlation between the increased expression of TIG- 3 protein and histologic improvement (p= 0. 020), suggesting that suppression of TIG- 3 may underlie the development of basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> This association suggests that reversal of TIG- 3 expression may help to explain the mechanism of retinoid action in epidermal differentiation and chemoprevention...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> are {{the most}} {{prevalent}} of all skin cancers worldwide and form {{the majority of the}} surgical workload for most modern cutaneous malignancy centres. Primary surgical removal of basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> remains the gold standard of treatment but, despite almost two centuries of surgical experience, rates of incomplete surgical excision of up to 50 % are still reported. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess, quantify and perform comparative analysis of the outcomes and predictive factors of consecutive primarily-excised basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> in a tertiary centre over a six-year period. METHODS: Retrospective audit was conducted on all patients who underwent surgical excision of basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> from January 2000 to December 2005.

RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred and thirty two basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were excised from 1329 patients over the designated time period. Two hundred and fifty one (14 %) lesions were incompletely excised with 135 (7. 4 %) involving the peripheral margin only, 48 (2. 6 %) the deep margin only and 41 (2. 2 %) involving both.

Methods: We selected 11 cases of signet-ring <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and 29 cases of mucinous carcinomas among 1595 consecutive colorectal carcinomas ondefined criteria and compared clinicopathological and molecular biological features between these twotypes ofcarcinomas. Results: Clinical stagings of signet-ring <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were far advanced and their prognosis tended to be worse than that of mucinous carcinomas. Furthermore, the incidence of K-ras mutations in signet-ring <b>cell</b> and mucinous <b>carcinomas</b> showed no {{difference between these two}} types of carcinomas. However, the incidence of K-ras mutation in these diseases was slightly lower than that in 30 ordinary colorectal carcinomas examined as a comparison.
