5000|$|In both {{coherent}} and incoherent lidar, {{there are two}} types of pulse models: micropulse lidar systems and high energy systems. Micropulse systems utilizing intermittent bursts of energy have developed as a result of the ever-increasing amount of computer power available combined with advances in laser technology. They use considerably less energy in the laser, typically on the order of one microjoule, and are often [...] "eye-safe," [...] meaning they can be used without safety precautions. High-power systems are common in atmospheric research, where they are widely used for measuring many atmospheric parameters: the height, layering and densities of clouds, <b>cloud</b> <b>particle</b> properties (extinction coefficient, backscatter coefficient, depolarization), temperature, pressure, wind, humidity, and trace gas concentration (ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Typical cirrus clouds may be {{susceptible}} to modification {{to reduce their}} lifetime and optical thickness, and hence their net positive radiative forcing (in contrast to the typical low, warm liquid clouds). Material to seed such modification could be delivered via drones or by aircraft. Scientists believe that cirrus clouds in the high latitude upper troposphere are formed by homogeneous freezing, resulting in large numbers of small ice crystals. If effective ice nuclei were introduced into this environment, the cirrus may instead form by heterogeneous freezing. If the concentration of ice nuclei is seeded such that the resulting <b>cloud</b> <b>particle</b> density is less than that for the natural case, the cloud particles should grow larger due to less water vapor competition and attain higher settling velocities. By seeding with aerosols, ice crystals could grow rapidly and deplete water vapor, suppress nucleation and any growth of ice crystals by homogeneous nucleation. The net effect would be a reduced optical thickness and a reduced cloud lifetime, allowing more infrared radiation to be emitted {{at the top of}} the atmosphere, as the ice particles sediment out. Less upper tropospheric water vapor and infrared radiation in the atmosphere would consequently cool the climate.|$|E

This paper presents a new optimization method called <b>cloud</b> <b>particles</b> evolution algorithm (CPEA) to solve optimization problems based on cloud formation process and phase transformation of natural substance. The cloud is assumed to have three states in the proposed algorithm. Gaseous state represents the global exploration. Liquid state represents the intermediate process from the global exploration to the local exploitation. Solid state represents the local exploitation. The cloud is composed of descript and independent particles in this algorithm. The <b>cloud</b> <b>particles</b> use phase transformation of three states to realize the global exploration and the local exploitation in the optimization process. Moreover, the <b>cloud</b> <b>particles</b> not only realize {{the survival of the}} fittest through competition mechanism but also ensure the diversity of the <b>cloud</b> <b>particles</b> by reciprocity mechanism.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for estimating the optical thickness of subvisual cirrus clouds detected by OSIRIS (Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imaging System), a limb-viewing satellite instrument that measures scattered radiances from the UV to the near-IR. The measurement set {{is composed of}} a ratio of limb radiance profiles at two wavelengths that indicates the presence of cloud-scattering regions. Cross-sections and phase functions from an in situ database are used to simulate scattering by cloud-particles. With appropriate configurations discussed in this paper, the SASKTRAN successive-orders of scatter radiative transfer model is able to simulate accurately the in-cloud radiances from OSIRIS. Configured in this way, the model is used with a multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MART) to retrieve the cloud extinction profile for an assumed effective <b>cloud</b> <b>particle</b> size. The sensitivity of these retrievals to key auxiliary model parameters is shown, and it is shown that the retrieved extinction profile, for an assumed effective <b>cloud</b> <b>particle</b> size, models well the measured in-cloud radiances from OSIRIS. The greatest sensitivity of the retrieved optical thickness is to the effective <b>cloud</b> <b>particle</b> size.

The surface data were averaged over a 2 -h interval centered {{at the time of the}} satellite overpass, and the satellite data were averaged within a 1 deg X 1 deg area centered on the ARM sites. In the DCS, <b>cloud</b> <b>particle</b> size is important for top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo and A(sub col) although the surface absorption is independent of <b>cloud</b> <b>particle</b> size. In this study, we find that the A(sub col) in the tropics is approximately 0. 011 more than that in the middle latitudes. This difference, however, disappears, i. e., the A(sub col) values at both regions converge to the same value (approximately 0. 27 of the total incoming solar radiation) in the optically thick limit (tau greater than 80). Comparing the observations with the NASA Langley modified Fu_Liou 2 -stream radiative transfer model for optically thick cases, the difference between observed and model-calculated surface absorption, on average, is less than 0. 01, but the model-calculated TOA albedo and A(sub col) differ by 0. 01 to 0. 04, depending primarily on the <b>cloud</b> <b>particle</b> size observation used.
