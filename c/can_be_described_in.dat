5|$|The {{matching}} rules <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> several ways. One {{approach is to}} color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another {{is to use a}} pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E
5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in physics {{is to the}} description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such systems <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions {{is to determine the}} system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} {{of the concept of}} a Hilbert space was underlined with the realization that it offers one of the best mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics. In short, the states of a quantum mechanical system are vectors in a certain Hilbert space, the observables are hermitian operators on that space, the symmetries of the system are unitary operators, and measurements are orthogonal projections. The relation between quantum mechanical symmetries and unitary operators provided an impetus {{for the development of the}} unitary representation theory of groups, initiated in the 1928 work of Hermann Weyl. On the other hand, in the early 1930s it became clear that classical mechanics <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> terms of Hilbert space (Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics) and that certain properties of classical dynamical systems can be analyzed using Hilbert space techniques in the framework of ergodic theory.|$|E

5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E

5000|$|Epistemic {{models are}} used to model how agents {{perceive}} the actual world. Their perception <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> terms of knowledge and beliefs about the world and about the other agents’ beliefs. The insight of the DEL approach <b>is</b> that one <b>can</b> <b>describe</b> how an event is perceived by the agents in a very similar way. Indeed, the agents’ perception of an event <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> terms of knowledge and beliefs. For example, the private announcement of [...] to [...] that her card <b>is</b> red <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> terms of knowledge and beliefs: while [...] tells [...] that her card is red (event [...] ) [...] believes that nothing happens (event [...] ). This leads to define the notion of event model whose definition {{is very similar to}} that of an epistemic model.|$|R

25|$|Ludwik Fleck {{establishes}} scientific constructivism {{by introducing}} {{the notions of}} thought collective (Denkkollektiv), and thought style (Denkstil), through which the evolution of science is much more understandable, because the research objects <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> terms of the assumptions (thought style) that are shared for practical but also inherently social reasons, or just because any thought collective tends to preserve itself. These notions have been drawn upon by Thomas Kuhn.|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{concepts of}} profession, success and professional success {{share a common}} characteristic, they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>describe</b> <b>in</b> objective or subjective terms. With regard to career success, in 1937, E. C. Hughes established this theoretical difference; nevertheless, studies on this subject, traditionally, have evaluated professional success in objective terms. More recently, the theoretical tendency recognizes objective– subjective duality in professional success, the interdependence between these two elements and it indicates that, they must be treated integrally on professional success studies...|$|R
