40|$|The {{presence}} of hollow glass fibers in laminates used in today's printed circuit boards, chip carrier substrates, and plastic {{ball grid arrays}} can {{have a significant impact}} on reliability. In the manufacture of laminates used for the electronic industry, glass fibers are used for reinforcement. Laminates are composed of several plies of glass fabrics encapsulated with a polymeric resin. The most common fabric fiber material used today in laminate manufacture is E-glass, a <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> <b>glass</b> <b>yarn</b> with a chemical composition by weight of mostly SiO 2, but also containing various amounts of CaO, Al 2 O 3 and other materials. Advantages of E-glass lie in its high tensile strength, water resistance, bond stability with resins, and relatively low cost. The dielectric constant (6. 3 at 23 oC and 1 MHz) is high, but acceptable for most low frequency applications. The manufacture of glass fiber begins with the dry mixing of silicas, limestone, clay, and boric acid in appropriate proportions. In the direct-melt process, the mixture is melted in a refractory furnace at temperatures between 2600 and 2800 oF and fed directly into bushings, which are platinum alloy plates with nozzles. Alternatively, the melt can be formed into marbles, cooled to room temperature and stored for future use. Additional information about this process is supplied by Loewenstein [1983]. A homogeneous melt composition with negligible impurities is necessary for the successful manufactur...|$|R

A patch test was performed on 43 volunteers for the follow-ings: glass wool for non-residential use with and without a urea-modified phenolic resin binder, that for residential use with and without the binder, and <b>continuous</b> <b>glass</b> <b>filaments</b> with diameters of 4, 7, 9, and 13 µm. Materials were applied to an upper arm of each volunteer for 24 h. The skin was observed at 1 and 24 h after the removal. At 1 h after removal, slight erythema was observed on the skin of a woman after the exposure to glass wool for residential use without the binder. Erythema was observed on the skin of another woman at 1 h after a 24 -h exposure to glass wool for non-residential use without the binder. There were no reactions at 24 h after the removal. The low reactions in the patch test suggested that the irritability caused by glass wool, irrespective of a resin component, could be induced mechanically, and that the irritability caused by <b>continuous</b> <b>glass</b> fila-ments with resin could be slight and either mechanical or chemical...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} the research {{work done in}} the framework of the Collaborative Research Centre – Textile Reinforcement for Structural Strengthening and Retrofitting. Previous results of textile reinforced concrete (TRC) have shown that the mechanical properties of the applied open grid warp knitted fabrics made of alkali-resistant <b>glass</b> <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> or carbon <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> as reinforcement material have not been utilized to complete satisfaction in the composition with the mineral matrix system. Further we have noticed that the orientation and configuration of the reinforcing fiber material is quite influenced by the handling in the further processing steps, which leads to the need of a sustainable structural stabilization. Different technologies for a subsequent structural stabilization e. g., dip-or spray coating with water-based polymer dispersions, thermal bonding, and laminating have been investigated. The results of these preliminary investigations have been published [2] and in consequence a suitable technology for a structural strengthening process has been selected. The structural strengthening of open grid warp knitted fabrics by means of an in-situ polymer coating process, which i...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a proactive product stewardship program for glass fibers. That effort included epidemiological studies of workers, establishment of stringent workplace exposure limits, liaison with customers on safe use of products and, most importantly, a research program {{to evaluate the}} safety of existing glass fiber products and guide development of new even safer products. Chronic inhalation exposure bioassays were conducted with rodents and hamsters. Amosite and crocidolite asbestos produced respiratory tract cancers as did exposure to “biopersistent” synthetic vitreous fibers. “less biopersistent” glass fibers did not cause respiratory tract cancers. Corollary studies demonstrated the role of slow fiber dissolution rates and biopersistence in cancer induction. These results guided development of safer glass fiber products and {{have been used in}} Europe to regulate fibers and by IARC and NTP in classifying fibers. IARC concluded special purpose fibers and refractory ceramic fibers are “possibly carcinogenic to humans” and insulation <b>glass</b> wool, <b>continuous</b> <b>glass</b> <b>filament,</b> rock wool and slag wool are “not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to human. ” The NTP’s 12 th report on carcinogens lists “Certain Glass Wool Fibers (Inhalable) ” as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. ” “Certain” in the descriptor refers to “biopersistent” glass fibers and excludes “less biopersistent” glass fibers...|$|R

50|$|Precursors {{for carbon}} fibers are {{polyacrylonitrile}} (PAN), rayon and pitch. Carbon fiber <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> {{are used in}} several processing techniques: the direct uses are for prepregging, filament winding, pultrusion, weaving, braiding, etc. Carbon fiber yarn is rated by the linear density (weight per unit length, i.e. 1 g/1000 m = 1 tex) or by number of <b>filaments</b> per <b>yarn</b> count, in thousands. For example, 200 tex for 3,000 filaments of carbon fiber is three times as strong as 1,000 carbon <b>filament</b> <b>yarn,</b> but is also three times as heavy. This thread can then be used to weave a carbon fiber filament fabric or cloth. The appearance of this fabric generally depends on the linear density of the yarn and the weave chosen.

30|$|One of the {{significant}} texturing processes in current use, air-jet texturing, operates by mechanical interlocking and not by heat setting {{in the case of}} the other texturing techniques such as false-twist. It is a cold fluid texturing process that converts flat, continuous synthetic <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> into an entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun-like yarn. Air-jet texturing has three types based on the supply yarn. Single-end air-jet texturing denotes the situation whereby single <b>filament</b> <b>yarn</b> is overfed to the texturing nozzle, and the resultant textured yarn is withdrawn. In case of parallel air-jet texturing, two or more <b>filaments</b> <b>yarns</b> are fed at the same overfeed into the nozzle so as to facilitate a blend of different types of supply material, or of the same material but with different filament linear densities or number of filaments, or different cross sectional shapes. In core-effect air-jet texturing two different <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> are fed under different overfeeds into the air-jet at the same time. In core-effect air-jet texturing, the lower overfeed yarn is called the core-yarn and the higher overfeed yarn is called the effect-yarn. The core-yarn overfeed determines the strength of the textured yarn. The effect-yarn overfeed determines the size of the protruded loops. It also has an indirect influence upon the number of loops per unit length and also on the linear density. Perhaps the most important influence of the effect-yarn overfeed is to be seen in the structure and appearance of the yarn. This is because loops are seen on the surface of the yarn in the same way that hairs are visible in a spun yarn. However, there is limited literature on core-effect air-jet texturing or the influence of the effect-yarn parameters on air-jet texturing performance. Researchers have not given adequate prominence in core-effect air-jet texturing and most of the research limited to single-end air-je texturing. Wickramasinghe (2003) has investigated the use of steam as an alternative fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing and studied the performance of sewing threads manufactured using core-effect steam-jet textured yarns. He reported that steam could be used as an alternative fluid for air in manufacturing core-effect spun-like textured sewing threads.|$|R
