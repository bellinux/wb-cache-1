5000|$|During {{this short}} film {{the camera is}} focused on Rita, without reverse angle shots. Rita is under everyone’s gaze, the gaze of others which acts also as a <b>controlling</b> <b>element,</b> a form of surveillance. We can’t see what Rita has before her because she can’t either. For example, we see her mother’s hands flit {{in and out of}} the frame, when her mother is fussing around her, but we never see her mother. We feel the desire to see what stands before her but, for the most part of the short film, we are not granted any {{gratification}} of this desire. For Rita hearing is fundamental, and that is why the story, from her “point of view” is told through the sounds, the noises. The sounds represent what we can’t see, they evoke it, and to some extent create it. Only through an unexpected and enigmatic encounter does the staging change, because this meeting suddenly enables her to [...] "see" [...] and we, for the first time, are gifted with her perspective and share her vision. The film explores this brief moment of grace. Then everything goes back to normal for Rita and for us.|$|E
50|$|Nonrandom X Inactivation {{leads to}} skewed X {{inactivation}}. Nonrandom X inactivation {{can be caused}} by chance or directed by genes. If the initial pool of cells in which X inactivation occurs is small, chance can cause skewing to occur in some individuals by causing a bigger proportion of the initial cell pool to inactivate one X chromosome. A reduction in the size of this initial cell pool would increase the likelihood of skewing occurring. This skewing can then be inherited by progeny cells, or increased by secondary selection. The X-chromosome <b>controlling</b> <b>element</b> (Xce) gene in mice has been found to influence genetically mediated skewing. It is unknown whether a similar gene plays a role in human X inactivation, although a 2008 study found that skewing in humans is mostly caused by secondary events rather than a genetic tendency.There is a much higher concordance rate in genetically identical (monozygotic) twins compared to non-identical (dizygotic) twins, which suggests a strong genetic input. A 10% difference in the skewing of genetically identical twins did exist however, so there are other contributing factors outside of genetics alone.It is difficult to identify primary nonrandom inactivation in humans, as early cell selection occurs in the embryo. Mutation and imprinting of the XIST gene, a part of the X inactivation centre, can result in skewing. This is rare in humans.|$|E

50|$|Like most {{deposits}} {{in the western}} Ore Mountains, the Schneeberg-Schlema-Alberoda deposit is situated on the Gera-Jachymov fault zone. This major geological structure with a length of several hundred kilometres strikes NW-SE, running from the central Bohemian Massif in the Czech Republic to central Germany. The main element of this fault zone in the Ore Mountains is the Roter Kamm ('Red Ridge') fault carrying a young quartz-hematite mineralisation, but no uranium. This fault forms {{the boundary between the}} Schneeberg and Oberschlema deposits, having a vertical displacement of about 400 m. The second <b>controlling</b> <b>element</b> for the deposit are Variscan granites, which underlie the deposit. The mineralised veins are within the exocontact of the granite, although the oldest uranium mineralisation is about 20 Ma younger than those granites. The third controlling factor is a heavily deformed unit of Ordovician to Silurian meta-sedimentary rocks. This so-called Loessnitz-Zwoenitz-Trough runs east-west, broadening toward the east. This rock unit is formed by quartzites, meta-black shales, amphibolites and skarns. It is contained within phyllites, which form the major rock type in this area of the Ore Mountains. The rocks of the Loessnitz-Zwoenitz-Trough are called the 'productive series', because they carry nearly all of the mineralisation. Although the vein structures can be followed from the productive series into the phyllites and granites, no significant mineralisation has been observed outside of it. The ore field contains about 1,800 mineralised veins. Uranium-bearing veins run approximately northwest to southeast, parallel to the Roter Kamm fault.|$|E

40|$|The genetic {{basis for}} a {{striking}} aleurone color variegation of a maize population from Colombia is described. The variegation {{is the result of}} the interaction of a particular r allele, designated r-cu, and a specific factor, Fcu (Factor Cuna), that collectively compose a <b>controlling</b> <b>element</b> system. In the absence of Fcu, a variable dilute (nonvariegated) pigmentation is expressed in the aleurone. The degree of variegation is determined by differences in the dosage of the Fcu element; differences in variegation between kernels with one r-cu vs. two r-cu's cannot be detected. Because of the specificity of the interaction, Fcu is different from the three other well-known controlling elements, Dt, Ac and En(=Spm), and therefore represents a fourth <b>controlling</b> <b>element</b> system in maize. In addition to Fcu, the Cuna tribal maize contains two other controlling elements, Dt and a very weak En. The prevalence of controlling elements in natural maize populations is discussed...|$|E
