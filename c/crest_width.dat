The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the factors associated with the length of the interproximal dental papilla in anterior teeth. Materials and methodsIn total, 102 interproximal sites of maxillary anterior teeth in 30 patients were examined. ResultsTempBond mixed with barium sulfate was applied to the tip of the inter- proximal dental papillae and mucogingival junction using a periodontal probe. Periapical films using a parallel technique were then taken. The {{presence of}} the interproximal dental papilla was determined on the radiographs. If the tip of the interproximal dental papilla was at the base of the contact point, the papilla was recorded as being present. If not, the papilla was considered to be recessed. The radiographs were transferred to a computer and analyzed using ImageJ software. Age, sex, and the following parameters were measured: the length of the interproximal dental papilla, the distance between the base of the contact point and bone <b>crest,</b> the <b>width</b> of keratinized gingiva, and the interdental distance. Results showed that the length of the interproximal dental papilla was significantly and individually related to the distance from the contact point to the bone <b>crest,</b> the <b>width</b> of the keratinized gingiva, and the interdental distance.

It is shown that a rectangular weir placed over an inverted V-notch of depth 0. 90 d gives the maximum operating range, where d is the overall depth of the inward trapezoidal weir (from the crest to the vertex). For all flows in the rectangular portion, the discharge is proportional to the linear power of the head, h, measured above a reference plane located at 0. 292 d below the weir crest, in the range 0. 90 d {{less than or equal to}} h less than or equal to 7. 474 : within a maximum error of +/- 1. 5 % from the theoretical discharge. The optimum range of operation of the newly designed weir is 200 % greater than that in the chimney weir designed by Keshava Murthy and Giridhar, and is nearly 950 % greater than that in the inverted V-notch. Experiments with two weirs having half <b>crest</b> <b>widths</b> of 0. 10 and 0. 12 m yield a constant average coefficient of discharge of 0. 634 and confirm the theory.

Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients undergoing extraction of at least three teeth were selected. Atraumatic extractions were performed. Of the three extraction sockets, one was grafted with ATG, other with β-TCP, and the third was left ungrafted. Cone-beam computed tomography scans were taken immediately after grafting and 4 months postoperatively to check the changes in alveolar <b>crest</b> height and <b>width</b> at all the sites. Three patients in whom implant placement was done after complete healing; bone samples were harvested using a 3 mm diameter trephine during osteotomy preparation from both the ridge preserved sites and studied histologically. Results: There was a statistically significant difference when the changes in width and height of alveolar crest were compared within all the three groups (P < 0. 05). Among three sites, ATG-grafted sites showed the most superior results with a minimal reduction in alveolar <b>crest</b> height and <b>width.</b> Histological analysis also showed the same trend with more new bone formation at ATG-grafted sites as compared to β-TCP-grafted sites.

40|$|AbstractA line {{absorber}} {{consisting of}} three cylindrical floats {{is shown to}} have high <b>crest</b> capture <b>widths</b> for wave energy conversion across a broad band of frequencies. The bow, mid and stern floats are small, medium and large respectively; the floats are spaced about half a wavelength apart so that forces and motion of adjacent floats are substantially in anti-phase. The bow and mid float are rigidly connected by a beam and a beam from the stern float is connected to a hinge above the mid float for power take off. The draft of the stern float enables heave resonance at a prominent wave frequency and the smaller draft of the mid float provides resonance at a somewhat lower frequency. Experimental results at about 1 : 8 scale show capture widths greater than 25 % of a wavelength in regular waves and greater than 20 % of a wavelength in irregular waves across {{a broad range of}} wave periods. A time-stepping model for regular waves with coefficients from linear diffraction theory showed similar power prediction with a generic drag coefficient of 1. 8.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: To {{identify}} pelvic rotation and/or distortion in able-bodied and untreated AIS {{girls with}} moderate and severe scoliosis and verify association of pelvic morphological changes with Cobb angle increase. METHODS: The 3 D coordinates of nine anatomic bony landmarks were identified to estimate pelvic orientation using a Flock of Birds system. The distances {{between the first}} sacral vertebral body (S 1) {{and each of the}} eight iliac spine landmarks in all three planes were calculated to identify pelvic distortion. Analysis of variance was used to assess pelvic orientation and determine pelvic distortion. Pearson coefficients of correlation were used to identify any relationships between Cobb angle and pelvic morphological parameters. RESULTS: Pelvic orientation was similar in able-bodied and scoliotic girls regardless of the severity of the spinal deformity. Significant differences were observed in pelvic morphology between AIS with severe untreated scoliosis and those with a moderate scoliosis for the right anterosuperior iliac spines (ASIS), the tip of the superior iliac crest (TSIC) and the widest tip of the iliac <b>crest</b> (WTIC) <b>widths</b> from S 1. Statistically significant correlations were observed between the Cobb angles and the iliac crest distances measured from S 1.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe key {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a 1 ‐D hydrodynamic and sediment transport model, namely, RILL 1 D, that handles transcritical flows over abrupt changes (e. g., formation of pool <b>crests</b> and <b>width</b> change) in a single rill and also predicts changes in rill bed elevation. Replication of rill conditions in terms of flow and bed evolution changes necessitated the use of an enhanced TVD‐MacCormack scheme with implementation of Tseng’s surface gradient method, to provide an oscillation free solution over formed pool crests. The model at the end of each time step calculates the flow depth, velocity, and bed shear stress and provides changes in bed elevation and grain size distribution within a cell. The hydrodynamic performance of RILL 1 D is evaluated by comparing its results with either analytical solutions or experimental observations from various benchmark tests with rigid bed conditions that include (1) formation of a hydraulic jump in a rectangular channel, (2) steady subcritical and transcritical flow (without a shock) over a hump, (3) formation of a hydraulic jump in a converging‐diverging frictionless channel, and (4) flows over step‐pools. It is shown that the enhanced TVD‐MacCormack scheme adequately simulates transcritical flows by preserving the mass conservation and reducing the artificial numerical error. The scheme also approximates satisfactorily depth and velocity for a single rill, with a fixed bed consisting of steps and pools, except near the pool headwalls where a backroller forms with negative velocities. The sediment component of RILL 1 D is evaluated by two field investigations of single rills with mobile beds. With the field data the code is tested for its ability to reproduce measured values of sediment transport rates. A sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the effects of cell size and critical erosional strength in the predictive ability of the model. RILL 1 D performs reasonably well in these simulations in terms of sediment prediction rates and fared adequately in terms of replicating rill bed morphology...|$|R

This study establishes morphologic and hydrodynamic parameters for predicting the type of cross-shore profile response following overwash for given pre-storm profile and storm conditions. More than 50 data sets were categorised into 7 different types of cross-shore profile response to overwash. These responses are: 1) crest accumulation 2) landward translation of dunes/berms 3) dune lowering 4) dune destruction 5) barrier accretion 6) barrier rollover (short-term),and 7) barrier disintegration. Dimensionless parameters describing the pre-storm morphology and storm characteristics for these data sets were then plotted in two-dimensional space and trends for the different response types identified.

40|$|Low crested reef type breakwaters are {{becoming}} increasingly popular for coastal protection. As they are entirely offshore, there are no structures on the beach to impact the amenity and safety of the beach itself. They may also offer attractive marine habitat and recreational amenity benefits. Their effectiveness increases with wave height. Fully submerged and semi-submerged low crested structures such as "reef" type breakwaters behave differently from conventional fully emerged structures and require appropriate design methods. This has restricted the use of low crested structures by designers without the design expertise in this field. Design parameters include <b>crest</b> level, length, <b>width</b> and distance offshore. Typical emerged breakwaters have a wave transmission coefficient, however, reef breakwaters reduce the wave height [1 > Kt > 0] rather than stopping all of the wave energy {{in the lee of}} the breakwater.

A randomized, prospective, clinicoradiographical, histological study was conducted to evaluate their efficacy in comparison with freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA) in alveolar ridge preservation. Materials and Methods: Graft preparation: with written consent, teeth were collected from three donors (full mouth extraction cases). Once donors' serums were tested negative for HIV, HBV, HCV, and Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL), mineralized whole tooth allograft (WTA) and dentin allograft (DA) were prepared using the standard protocol of Tissue Bank at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India. Study Design: In this randomized controlled trial, 15 patients undergoing extraction of at least four teeth were selected. In each patient after atraumatic extractions, one socket was grafted with WTA, second with DA, third with FDBA, and fourth was left ungrafted (control site). All the sites were covered with chorion membrane. To estimate three-dimensional alveolar crest changes, cone beam computed tomography scans were taken immediately after grafting and 4 months postoperatively. Bone biopsies using 3 mm trephine bur were obtained from four patients at the time of implant placement and evaluated histologically. Results: Clinically uneventful healing was observed at all sites. Compared to other sites, WTA and DA consistently showed superior results demonstrating least reduction in alveolar <b>crest</b> height and <b>width</b> which was statistically significant (P < 0. 05).

40|$|A hand-elevation {{study was}} carried out in the {{laboratory}} in order to alter peripheral blood flow with the aim of increasing understanding of factors affecting the morphology of peripheral photoplethysmographic signals. Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals were recorded from twenty healthy volunteer subjects during a hand-elevation study in which the right hand was raised and lowered relative to heart level, while the left hand remained static. Red and infrared (IR) PPG signals were obtained from the right and left index fingers using a custom-made PPG processing system. PPG features were identified using a feature-detection algorithm based on the first derivative of the PPG signal. The systolic PPG amplitude, the reflection index, <b>crest</b> time, pulse <b>width</b> at half height, and delta T were calculated from 20  s IR PPG signals from three positions of the right hand with respect to heart level (- 50, 0, + 50  cm) in 19 volunteers. PPG features were found to change with hand elevation. On lowering the hand to 50  cm below heart level, ac systolic PPG amplitudes from the finger decreased by 68. 32  %, while raising the arm increased the systolic amplitude by 69. 99  %. These changes in amplitude were attributed to changes in hydrostatic pressure and the veno-arterial reflex. Other morphological variables, such as crest time, were found to be statistically significantly different across hand positions, indicating increased vascular resistance on arm elevation than on dependency. It was hypothesized that these morphological PPG changes were influenced by changes in downstream venous resistance, rather than arterial, or arteriolar, resistance. Changes in hand position relative to heart level can significantly affect the morphology of the peripheral ac PPG waveform. These alterations are due to a combination of physical effects and physiological responses to changes in hand position, which alter vascular resistance. Care should be taken when interpreting morphological data derived from PPG signals and methods should be standardized to take these effects into account...|$|R
40|$|Fields of {{sand dunes}} are {{ubiquitous}} {{in the north}} polar region of Mars and provide a record of sand transport processes influenced by Mars? polar climate. Spatial and temporal variations in dunes, ripples, coarse-grained ripples, and exposed dune cross-strata were analyzed in two areas of the Olympia Undae Dune Field {{in order to assess}} the influence of the Martian polar boundary conditions on ripple and dune activity and on pattern development. Two- and three-dimensional parameters, including dune <b>crest</b> length, spacing, <b>width,</b> slope, and height, were statistically assessed using regression analysis and descriptive statistics. Sediment fluxes were calculated using Co-registration of Optically Sensed Imagery and Correlation (COSICorr), a program that precisely co-registers and correlates imagery, and by measuring dune displacement. Two-dimensional pattern analysis indicates the co-existence of two populations of dunes that can be interpreted as two generations or as forming simultaneously under sediment availability limited conditions. Three-dimensional pattern analysis shows an asymmetry in slope profiles of the primary dunes and is consistent with primary dunes forming transversely to constructional winds. Four different types of ripple crestline patterns are identified and likely arise due to differences in grain size and dune-modified wind speeds and secondary flow directions. Maximum measured ripple displacement in the center of Olympia Undae study area is ~ 1. 4 m yr^- 1 ? 0. 13 m. Assuming a mean ripple height of 0. 11 m and a 4 : 1 saltation to reptation ratio, the sediment flux is ~ 0. 42 m? m^- 1 yr^- 1. Adjacent to the polar ice cap, barchan dune crest displacements range between 0. 25 m yr- 1 and 2. 80 m yr- 1 and dune heights between 11 m and 31 m. Mean sediment flux is 3. 5 m? m- 1 yr- 1. Results indicate that there is a spatial decay in sediment transport across the field and that fluxes near the cap are comparable to those found in Nili Patera, Mars and Victoria Valley, Antarctica. Overall the polar boundary conditions seasonally limit sand availability by seasonal frost cover and subsurface ice. The polar boundary conditions are most influential at the dune pattern scale, but appear to have little influence on the ripple pattern or ripple mobility...|$|R
