40|$|Abstractâ€”If cluster C 1 {{consists}} of computers with a faster mean speed than the <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 2, does this imply that cluster C 1 is more productive than cluster C 2 ? What if the <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 1 {{have the same}} mean speed as the <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 2 : is the one with computers that have a higher variance in speed more productive? Simulation experiments are performed to explore the above questions within a formal framework for measuring {{the performance of a}} cluster. Simulation results show that both mean speed and variance in speed (when mean speeds are equal) are typically correlated with the performance of a cluster, but not always; these statements are quantified statistically for our simulation environments. In addition, simulation results also show that: (1) If the mean speed of <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 1 is faster by at least a threshold amount than the mean speed of <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 2, then C 1 is more productive than C 2. (2) If the <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> clusters C 1 and C 2 have the same mean speed, then C 1 is more productive than C 2 when the variance <b>in</b> speed of <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 1 is higher by at least a threshold amount than the variance <b>in</b> speed of <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 2.

5|$|Gumball is {{an action}} video {{game for the}} home <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> which the player works in a factory as a gumball sorter and sorts gumballs by color as they flow through a maze-like {{processing}} machine.

If the player sorts incorrectly, the foreman walks onscreen and dumps the gumballs out the bin. The player has a daily quota to meet {{by the end of}} the level's time limit. If successful, the player character receives a promotion; the player watches an animation of a worker walking home from the factory, and progresses to a more complex level, with more color options to sort and defective, explosive gumballs to deactivate. If unsuccessful in meeting the daily quota, the game ends and the player is left to restart from the beginning.|$|E

He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E
