50|$|In confectionery, {{it reduces}} viscosity, replaces more {{expensive}} ingredients, controls sugar crystallization {{and the flow}} properties of chocolate, helps in the homogeneous mixing of ingredients, improves shelf life for some products, {{and can be used}} as a coating. In emulsions and fat spreads, it stabilizes emulsions, reduces spattering during frying, improves texture of spreads and flavour release. In doughs and bakery, it reduces fat and egg requirements, helps even distribution of ingredients in dough, stabilizes fermentation, increases volume, protects yeast cells in dough when frozen, and acts as a releasing agent to prevent sticking and simplify cleaning. It improves wetting properties of hydrophilic powders (e.g., low-fat proteins) and lipophilic powders (e.g., cocoa powder), controls dust, and helps complete dispersion in water. Lecithin keeps cocoa and cocoa butter in a candy bar from separating. It {{can be used as a}} component of <b>cooking</b> <b>sprays</b> to prevent sticking and as a releasing agent. In margarines, especially those containing high levels of fat (>75%), lecithin is added as an 'antispattering' agent for shallow frying.|$|R
40|$|When aqueous {{potato starch}} {{suspensions}} were heated into the solution state and cooled, spreadable particle gels were obtained with a spherulite morphology and a cream-like texture. This so-called superheated starch (SHS) exhibits more effective gelling properties than maltodextrin, {{which is currently}} applied as a fat mimetic. In addition, a gel-like texture is immediately obtained when mixing dry SHS with cold water. Other starch types showed similar properties. Gel moduli were higher as amylose content increased. A large-scale preparation procedure based on jet <b>cooking</b> and <b>spray</b> drying with or without intermediate gelation was devised. SHS {{was identified as a}} slightly to moderately degraded starch. The formation of particle gels with spherulitic morphology was observed over at least two decades of Mw from 0. 06 to 16 × 106 g/mol. At higher molar mass, demixing between amylose and amylopectin was observed. These phenomena are tentatively explained by assuming a competition between demixing and crystallization. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Cooking {{is done on}} a {{charcoal}} grill. The grates are greased with pork fat, bacon, oil, butter or <b>cooking</b> <b>spray</b> {{in order to prevent}} sticking. While the meat is gently cooked over light to medium heat, it is basted after every turn with the marinade or with beer, sprayed directly from a gently shaken bottle. This serves to improve the taste and prevents a drying of the meat on the cooking surface. Moreover, the cooking temperature is regulated by gently spraying beer directly on the charcoal; the rising steam helps to cook and flavour the meat.|$|E

50|$|Lecithin {{can easily}} be {{extracted}} chemically using solvents such as hexane, ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether, benzene, etc., or extraction can be done mechanically. It is usually available from sources such as soybeans, eggs, milk, marine sources, rapeseed, cottonseed, and sunflower. It has low solubility in water, but is an excellent emulsifier. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either liposomes, bilayer sheets, micelles, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of surfactant that usually is classified as amphipathic. Lecithin is sold as a food additive and dietary supplement. In cooking, it is sometimes used as an emulsifier and to prevent sticking, for example in nonstick <b>cooking</b> <b>spray.</b>|$|E

50|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{were once}} {{often used as}} propellants, but since the Montreal Protocol came into force in 1989, they have been {{replaced}} in nearly every country due to the negative effects CFCs have on Earth's ozone layer. The most common replacements are mixtures of volatile hydrocarbons, typically propane, n-butane and isobutane. Dimethyl ether (DME) and methyl ethyl ether are also used. All these have the disadvantage of being flammable. Nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are also used as propellants to deliver foodstuffs (for example, whipped cream and <b>cooking</b> <b>spray).</b> Medicinal aerosols such as asthma inhalers use hydrofluoroalkanes (HFA): either HFA 134a (1,1,1,2,-tetrafluoroethane) or HFA 227 (1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) or combinations of the two.

Cooking was done on the high setting, the low setting was for allowing the machine to remain idle. Machines were available as either a single (aka Brown Bobby Junior) for US$52 or as two machines riveted together into a single unit for US$100. Since these machines are no longer manufactured they are prized by their owners and often handed down to subsequent generations to continue a tradition of Brown Bobby making, especially during the holidays.|$|E

50|$|Inhalant users inhale vapors or aerosol {{propellant}} gases using plastic bags held over the mouth or by breathing {{from an open}} container of solvents, such as gasoline or paint thinner. Nitrous oxide gases from whipped cream aerosol cans, aerosol hairspray or non-stick frying spray are sprayed into plastic bags. Some nitrous oxide users spray the gas into balloons. When inhaling non-stick <b>cooking</b> <b>spray</b> or other aerosol products, some users may filter the aerosolized particles out with a rag. Some gases, such as propane and butane gases, are inhaled directly from the canister. Once these solvents or gases are inhaled, the extensive capillary surface of the lungs rapidly absorb the solvent or gas, and blood levels peak rapidly. The intoxication effects occur so quickly {{that the effects of}} inhalation can resemble the intensity of effects produced by intravenous injection of other psychoactive drugs. Some harm reduction experts encourage glue sniffers to use paper bags rather than thin plastic bags, because plastic bags greatly increase the risk of suffocation, as plastic bags are more likely to stick to the users' nose and mouth while she or he is intoxicated.|$|E
40|$|What are inhalants? Inhalants are {{breathable}} chemical vapors or gases {{that produce}} psychoactive (mind-altering) effects when abused or misused. These include volatile organic solvents, fuel gases, nitrites, and anesthetic gases. They {{do not include}} inhaled medicinal drugs that are taken as prescribed. Once {{commonly referred to as}} “glue sniffing, ” inhalant abuse now includes a broad range of volatile solvents and gas products (e. g., model airplane glue, paint thinner, gasoline, and nail polish remover), aerosols (e. g., nonstick <b>cooking</b> <b>spray</b> and hair spray), anesthetics (e. g., nitrous oxide or “laughing gas ” and ether), and nitrites (e. g., amyl, butyl, and isobutyl nitrites, often marketed as “poppers ” or room odorizers). (Other powdered drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine, can be inhaled but are not considered inhalants.) Although the chemicals involved and their effects vary, the route of administration is the common factor. What are the most common modes of administration? Inhalants are abused either by “sniffing ” through the nose or inhaling fumes through the open mouth (“huffing”) much like a smoker inhales cigarette smoke. Usually the open tube of glue, nail polish, or marker is placed close to the nose and the fumes are inhaled. People who abuse inhalants may also spray the substance into a plastic or paper bag and huff that way (“bagging”) or even place the bag over the entire head. Often a product will be poured or sprayed on a piece of cloth, a rag, a towel, or a shirt sleeve or into a soda can and inhaled in that manner. Another method is to paint the fingernails with a product such as correction fluid and inhale the substance from the nails. Sometimes an aerosol substance is sprayed directly into the mouth. Substances also can be placed into alternative containers (e. g., balloon filled with nitrous oxide) or heated and then inhaled (Synergies 2002). Who is likely to abuse inhalants? Contrary to popular perception, people who abuse inhalants are found throughout the population and no one group can be categorized as “inhalant abusers. ” In 2001, more than 18. 2 million Americans reported ever having used an inhalant, and 141, 000 were estimated to need treatment because they were dependent on or abused inhalants.
