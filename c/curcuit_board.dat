40|$|The {{aim of this}} master’s {{thesis is}} to {{implement}} an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) foraudio applications using external components together with an FPGA (Field-ProgrammableGate Array). The focus is on making the ADC low-cost and it is desirable to achieve 16 -bitresolution at 48 KS/s. Since large FPGA’s have numerous I/O-pins, there are usually someunused pins and logic available in the FPGA {{that can be used}} for other purposes. This istaken advantage of, to make the ADC as low-cost as possible. This thesis presents two solutions: (1) a - (Sigma-Delta) converter with a ﬁrst order passive loop-ﬁlter and (2) a - converter with a second order active loop-ﬁlter. The solutionshave been designed on a PCB (Printed <b>Curcuit</b> <b>Board)</b> with a Xilinx Spartan- 6 FPGA. Bothsolutions take advantage of the LVDS (Low-Voltage-Diﬀerential-Signaling) input buﬀers inthe FPGA. (1) achieves a peak SNDR (Signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio) of 62. 3 dB (ENOB (Eﬀectivenumber of bits) 10. 06 bits) and (2) achieves a peak SNDR of 80. 3 dB (ENOB 13. 04). (1) isvery low-cost ($ 0. 06) but is not suitable for high-precision audio applications. (2) costs $ 0. 53 for mono audio and $ 0. 71 for stereo audio and is comparable with the solution used today:an external ADC (PCM 1807) ...|$|E

Because of these two problems, the save rinses must be set aside periodically as unusable, and fresh tanks of water made up [...] Options:- Tin/lead save solution can be shipped off-site for treatment and disposal. h_a. ysfg: The cost for this option is $ 150 +/ 55 gal. drum. 4 It also wastes any recoverable metal. - Tin/lead save solution can be neutralized and sewered. &n_alys&g: While {{it may be possible to}} remain below the effluent limits for lead while doing this, it is not assured. Sewering large amounts of lead on a regular basis is also not environmentally sound. - Tin and lead can be removed electrolytically from the save solution, using equipment made by several manufacturers, or equipment built by Telex (see Appendix, p. 24). The resulting tin/lead metal can be accumulated and sold (see Appendix, p. 21) and the remaining solution neutralized and sewered. - Tin/lead can be removed from the save solution using aluminum (see Appendix, p. 25), the metal accumulated and sold, and the remaining solution neutralized and sewered...|$|R
