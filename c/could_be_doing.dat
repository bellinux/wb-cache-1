[...] Badu's iChat contacts, including hip hop producers Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, and J Dilla, instant messaged her {{to get back into}} the studio and sent her tracks. Such exchanges inspired a creative spark for Badu, which she explained in an interview for the Dallas Observer, [...] "I started to accept that maybe it's OK for me to put out music, and it doesn't have to be something dynamic or world-changing. But just as I was accepting that, here comes this burst of light and energy and creativity. And that's the process, I guess, of life—the detachment and the release of something gives you even more room to grow or be creative." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Avengers: Age of Ultron {{succeeds in}} the top {{priority}} of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do, {{but this time the}} action scenes don't always measure up." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety wrote, [...] "If this is what the apotheosis of branded, big-studio entertainment has come to look like in 2015, we <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> much worse. Unlike its title character, Age of Ultron most definitely has soul." [...] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times and giving the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, Richard Roeper said, [...] "Some day, an Avengers film might collapse under the weight of its own awesomeness. I mean, how many times can they save the world? But this is not that day." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Age of Ultron is a whole summer of fireworks packed into one movie. It doesn't just go to 11, it starts there. [...] takes a few wrong turns, creating a jumble when the action gets too thick. But he recovers like a pro, devising a spectacle that's epic {{in every sense of the}} word." [...] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars, stating that despite being [...] "bigger, louder and more disjointed" [...] than its predecessor, [...] "it’s also got more personality—specifically Whedon's—than any other film in the now seven-year-old franchise." [...] Helen O'Hara of Empire praised the interactions between the characters, the action set-pieces and Whedon's ability as a director in her review, stating that the film [...] "redefines the scale we can expect from our superheroes." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{questioned}} about which songs he played on, especially ones where there exists some controversy {{as to what}} his exact role was, Page often points {{out that it is}} hard to remember exactly what he did given the enormous number of sessions he was playing at the time. In a radio interview he explained that [...] "I was doing three sessions a day, fifteen sessions a week. Sometimes I would be playing with a group, sometimes I <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> film music, it could be a folk session... I was able to fit all these different roles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nas {{announced}} the album's title after a performance on May 18, 2006. In a late September interview on English DJ Tim Westwood's Radio show, Nas said, [...] "Hip-hop is dead because we as artists {{no longer have}} the power." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Could you imagine what 50 Cent <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing,</b> Nas, Jay, Eminem, if we were the Jimmy Iovines? Could you imagine the power we'd have? I think that's where we're headed." [...] He has described the album as a mixture of [...] "street" [...] records, [...] "political" [...] records and collaborations.

Speaking to GQ Australia in November 2010, Clarke said of his decision to leave the tour of New Zealand, [...] "My decision that I made there, was what I thought was right. I respect playing for my country that much that I thought, if I’m going to let anybody down, I shouldn’t be here — there’s somebody else who <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> {{a better job than}} me.

In fact, in [...] "One Hour" [...] Don states that he does not like living in the shadow of his genius brother, though he respects him and his abilities very much and they have become closer. Sometimes, he feels that Charlie isn't doing all the great things he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> because he is working with the FBI. Still, he does often question his brother only to have his faith in Charlie's abilities restored. In [...] "Burn Rate", their father says, [...] "But have you ever known your brother to let his emotions trump his math?" [...] Just because Don gets emotional, he thought this was the case with Charlie and even stated his brother was backing one of his own. In [...] "Trust Metric", Charlie says that he has a giant ego.|$|E
