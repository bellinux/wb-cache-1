25|$|Normal {{operation}} of cement kilns provides combustion conditions {{which are more}} than adequate {{for the destruction of}} even the most difficult to destroy organic substances. This is primarily due to the very high temperatures of the kiln gases (2000nbsp&°C in the <b>combustion</b> <b>gas</b> from the main burners and 1100nbsp&°C in the gas from the burners in the precalciner). The gas residence time at high temperature in the rotary kiln is of the order of 5–10 seconds and in the precalciner more than 3 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Apex seal lifting. Centrifugal force {{pushes the}} apex seal onto the housing surface forming a firm seal. Gaps can develop between the apex seal and troichoid housing in light-load {{operation}} when imbalances in centrifugal force and gas pressure occur. At low engine-rpm ranges, or under low-load conditions, gas {{pressure in the}} combustion chamber can cause the seal to lift off the surface, resulting in <b>combustion</b> <b>gas</b> leaking into the next chamber. Mazda developed a solution, changing {{the shape of the}} troichoid housing, which meant that the seals remain flush to the housing. Using the Wankel engine at sustained higher revolutions helps eliminate apex seal lift off, and makes it very viable in applications such as electricity generation. In motor vehicles, the engine will be suited to series-hybrid applications.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{locomotives}} (numbers 92020-92029) {{were built}} in 1955 with the Franco-Crosti boiler. which incorporated a <b>combustion</b> <b>gas</b> feed water preheater that recuperated low-grade residual heat In the 9F version, this {{took the form of}} a single cylindrical water drum running along the underside of the main boiler barrel. The standard chimney on top of the smokebox was only used during lighting up. In normal working the gases went through firetubes inside the preheater drum that led to a second smokebox situated beneath the boiler from which there emerged a chimney on the right-hand side, just forward of the firebox. In the event, the experiment did not deliver the hoped-for benefits, and efficiency was not increased sufficiently to justify the cost and complexity. Moreover, conditions were unpleasant on the footplate in a cross-wind, this in spite of the later provision of a small deflector plate forward of the chimney. These problems led to the subsequent removal of the preheater drum, although the locomotives did retain the original main smokebox with its distinctive look.|$|E

50|$|Warm {{spraying}} {{is a novel}} {{modification of}} high velocity oxy-fuel spraying, in which the temperature of <b>combustion</b> <b>gas</b> is lowered by mixing nitrogen with the <b>combustion</b> <b>gas,</b> thus bringing the process closer to the cold spraying.

These advantages are especially important for such coating materials as Ti, plastics, and metallic glasses, which rapidly oxidize or deteriorate at high temperatures.|$|E
