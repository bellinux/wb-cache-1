5|$|Under a 1909 law, the State Highway Board {{surveyed}} a <b>connected</b> <b>network</b> {{of proposed}} state roads. Included was a westerly extension of SR 5 via Chehalis to South Bend and Aberdeen and an easterly extension to Pullman. A route from Yakima southeast and east via the Tri-Cities to Idaho was also surveyed, mostly {{as an extension}} of State Road 8 (Columbia River Road). The legislature added most of these routes to the state highway system in 1913, when they formed a two-tiered system of primary and secondary roads. Primary roads were completely controlled by the state, including maintenance, and received only names, while secondary roads kept their numbers and county maintenance. The National Park Highway replaced State Road 5 west of Riffe, and extended as surveyed to and beyond South Bend, and the McClellan Pass Highway replaced State Road 1 and continued via State Road 5 to Yakima. The majority of the route from Yakima via Connell to Pullman was not added at that time; it was finally taken over in 1937 as Secondary State Highways 11A and 11B. Only the route via the Tri-Cities, forming part of the Inland Empire Highway, continued from Yakima to Idaho. East of Pomeroy, the original survey had curved south, using State Road 16 to near the Oregon state line; this was bypassed by the 1913 designation, which instead continued directly east to Clarkston. Unlike the earlier state roads, these primary roads mostly followed existing passable county roads. The incomplete roadway between Riffe and the American River remained as part of secondary State Road 5, and the legislature designated the surveyed route from the National Park Highway near Raymond north to Aberdeen as secondary State Road 20 in 1915.|$|E

25|$|After {{the demise}} of the turnpikes, the State Commission of Highways was created by the {{legislature}} in 1898 to improve and maintain state highways. In 1909, a <b>connected</b> <b>network</b> of routes was laid out by the legislature; none of the present NY52 was included. It was also not part of the system of signed state routes numbered in 1924. By 1926, Route39 was signed from Poughkeepsie to Patterson, using a short piece of modern NY52 between East Fishkill and Stormville. The rest of old Route39 used modern NY376 from Poughkeepsie to East Fishkill, NY216 from Stormville to Poughquag, NY55 from Poughquag to West Pawling, NY292 from West Pawling to West Patterson, and NY311 from West Patterson to Patterson.|$|E
500|$|For thermosets, {{typically}} {{two different}} chemical components are {{injected into the}} barrel. These components immediately begin irreversible chemical reactions which eventually crosslinks the material into a single <b>connected</b> <b>network</b> of molecules. As the chemical reaction occurs, the two fluid components permanently transform into a viscoelastic solid. [...] Solidification in the injection barrel and screw can be problematic and have financial repercussions; therefore, minimising the thermoset curing within the barrel is vital. This typically means that the residence time and temperature of the chemical precursors are minimised in the injection unit. The residence time can be reduced by minimising the barrel's volume capacity and by maximising the cycle times. These factors {{have led to the}} use of a thermally isolated, cold injection unit that injects the reacting chemicals into a thermally isolated hot mould, which increases the rate of chemical reactions and results in shorter time required to achieve a solidified thermoset component. After the part has solidified, valves close to isolate the injection system and chemical precursors, and the mould opens to eject the moulded parts. Then, the mould closes and the process repeats.|$|E

2500|$|After passing several early laws {{designating}} state roads {{starting in}} 1893, the Washington State Legislature created the State Highway Board in 1905 and appropriated funds to construct - but not maintain - twelve numbered [...] "state roads" [...] in sparsely settled {{areas of the}} state. (Main highways in more populated areas {{would continue to be}} entirely under county control, though sometimes built with 50% state aid.) Six of these highways were eastwest crossings of the Cascades; others included a portion of Chuckanut Drive and a road around {{the west side of the}} Olympic Peninsula. Under a 1909 law, the State Highway Board surveyed a <b>connected</b> <b>network</b> of proposed state roads, The legislature added most of these routes to the state highway system in 1913, when they formed a two-tiered system of primary and secondary roads.

2500|$|A second {{assumption}} {{in these}} calculations is that populations are homogeneous, or well-mixed, meaning that every individual comes {{into contact with}} every other individual, when in reality populations are better described as social networks as individuals tend to cluster together, remaining in relatively close contact with {{a limited number of}} other individuals. In these networks, transmission only occurs between those who are geographically or physically close to one another. The shape and size of a network is likely to alter a disease's HIT, making incidence either more or less common. In heterogeneous populations, R0 is now considered to be a measure of the number of cases generated by a [...] "typical" [...] infectious person, which depends on how individuals within a network interact with each other. Interactions within networks are more common than between networks, in which case the most highly connected networks transmit disease more easily, resulting in a higher R0 and a higher HIT than would be required in a less <b>connected</b> <b>network.</b> In networks that either opt not to become immune or are not immunized sufficiently, diseases may persist despite not existing in better-immunized networks.|$|E

40|$|M. H. Azadmanesh 2 A. W. Krings 3 Approximate Agreement is an {{important}} issue in fault-tolerant distributed computing where non-faulty processes exchange and vote upon their local values to arrive at values which are within the range of the initial values of the non-faulty processes and within a predefined tolerance of each other. Results to date in Approximate Agreement, however, are not capable of exploiting omission faults. Omission faults are presumed not to occur or a priori default value is substituted for those values not received, or they are globally discarded from the voting multisets before the voting algorithm executes. As a result, hybrid fault models can not differentiate between omissive and transmissive faults. The performance and fault tolerance expressions for completely <b>connected</b> <b>networks,</b> in the presence of omission faults, have recently been obtained. This paper develops a methodology which logically converts partially <b>connected</b> <b>networks</b> into completely <b>connected</b> <b>networks.</b> This way the results of completely connected systems can be applied to obtain the local convergence and fault tolerance expressions for partially connected systems. This methodology provides a foundation for on-going research in global convergence for partially <b>connected</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Modeling the {{forwarding}} feature {{and analyzing}} the performance theoretically for opportunistic routing in wireless multihop network are of great challenge. To address this issue, a generalized geometric distribution (GGD) is firstly proposed. Based on the GGD, the forwarding probability between any two forwarding candidates {{could be calculated}} {{and it can be}} proved that the successful delivery rate after several transmissions of forwarding candidates is irrelevant to the priority rule. Then, a discrete-time queuing model is proposed to analyze mean end-to-end delay (MED) of a regular opportunistic routing with the knowledge of the forwarding probability. By deriving the steady-state joint generating function of the queue length distribution, MED for directly <b>connected</b> <b>networks</b> and some special cases of nondirectly <b>connected</b> <b>networks</b> could be ultimately determined. Besides, an approximation approach is proposed to assess MED for the general cases in the nondirectly <b>connected</b> <b>networks.</b> By comparing with a large number of simulation results, the rationality of the analysis is validated. Both the analysis and simulation results show that MED varies with the number of forwarding candidates, {{especially when it comes to}} connected networks; MED increases more rapidly than that in nondirectly <b>connected</b> <b>networks</b> with the increase of the number of forwarding candidates...|$|R
