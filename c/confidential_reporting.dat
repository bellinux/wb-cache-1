50|$|Sentinel {{surveillance}} uses {{a network}} of health care providers to report cases of occupational disease. This approach {{is similar to a}} register of occupational diseases, with some important differences. Sentinel networks may not try to achieve total coverage, and may operate in a restricted geographical area or involve a sample of physicians. In the UK, the THOR network is responsible for the collection of specialist-based work-related disease data. The program relies on the systematic, voluntary and <b>confidential</b> <b>reporting</b> of new cases by consulting thoracic physicians throughout the country. Regular reports are required from physicians detailing the number of new cases in each of 10 diagnostic categories and data for each case based on age, sex, place of residence, type of work and suspected agent. The Occupational Surveillance Scheme for Audiologists (OSSA) operates within the THOR network.|$|E
50|$|The Aviation Safety Reporting System, or ASRS, is the US Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) {{voluntary}} <b>confidential</b> <b>reporting</b> {{system that}} allows pilots and other aircraft crew members to confidentially report near misses and close calls {{in the interest of}} improving air safety. The ASRS collects, analyzes, and responds to voluntarily submitted aviation safety incident reports in order to lessen the likelihood of aviation accidents. The confidential and independent nature of the ASRS is key to its success, since reporters do {{not have to worry about}} any possible negative consequences of coming forward with safety problems. The ASRS is run by NASA, a neutral party, since it has no power in enforcement. The success of the system serves as a positive example that is often used as a model by other industries seeking to make improvements in safety.|$|E

40|$|Organizational {{safety culture}} has been a focus of {{research}} in sociotechnical systems, such as civil aviation, as organizational factors have been increasingly noted as contributory to accidents. The aim {{of the present study}} was to validate the Commercial Aviation Safety Survey (CASS), developed at the University of Illinois, in the context of Chinese flight operations. Two specific goals of this study included translating and developing a Chinese version of CASS based on the English version, and exploring the specific cultural and safety contexts of the Chinese version of the CASS. A particular focus of the study examined <b>confidential</b> <b>reporting</b> systems. A translation-back translation technique was used to convert the CASS into Chinese while maintaining the integrity in the meaning of the concepts. The survey was modified to adapt to the current Chinese civil aviation system regulation (CAAC), which included adding localized demographics and investigation of attitudes toward developing a <b>confidential</b> <b>reporting</b> system. The elementary confirmative factor analysis demonstrated that the CASS could be applied in the Chinese context. The general results from the two airlines surveye...|$|E
40|$|CIRAS {{has been}} in {{business}} for 18 years. This paper demonstrates how unique insights from <b>confidential</b> <b>reporting</b> can prevent accidents, helping to improve organisational resilience – and, ultimately, business performance. CIRAS is able to ‘trap ’ information from frontline staff who choose {{for a variety of}} reasons to use an independent service. This information might otherwise be lost by conventional, internal reporting systems because in certain circumstances, they may not be fully utilised. CIRAS is therefore in a position to share why some staff feel that internal reporting channels have not been successful, or in a minority of cases have come directly to CIRAS. The barriers to safety reporting, why staff choose to report to CIRAS, and the positive changes facilitated by CIRAS reports are all discussed here. In addition, the safety lessons and insights gained predominantly from the rail industry are directly applicable in many other industries too. <b>Confidential</b> <b>reporting</b> can, in fact, work very effectively in any industry where there are safety risks, as the core principles are the same...|$|E
40|$|After {{several major}} {{structural}} incidents in The Netherlands, various initiatives have been started to improve structural safety. Research studies were initiated on the characteristics, causes {{and consequences of}} structural incidents. In this paper the results of three of these research studies are compared. Each study uses different data sources: a <b>confidential</b> <b>reporting</b> system called ABC registration, Dutch arbitration awards on 'structural' failures and a newspaper called Cobouw. It appears that {{the reliability of the}} research studies varies due to the quality of both source and analysis. In addition, a comparison of the results shows variations due to the type of sources used. However, general patterns have been derived from the three databases. From this study it can be concluded that contrasting and combining results of different sources has improved the overview of structural incidents and has provided an insight into trends.
