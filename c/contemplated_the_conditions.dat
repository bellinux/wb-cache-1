40|$|The {{success of}} Project Launch, a teacher {{induction}} program {{sponsored by a}} regional teacher center and a consortium of universities, is compared for rural and non-rural participants. Indicators of success include teacher accomplishment of action plan goals, teacher self and mentor assessment of teaching strengths related to action plan goals, profiles of teaching strengths, and retention in teaching. Measures of teaching strength are related to INTASC standards. Rural participants differed significantly from non-rural participants in their lower self-perceived accomplishment of action plan goals. Rural participants {{were significantly more likely}} to move from their 1 st positions after 1 year, but their attrition was not significantly different in later years. Ways to structure induction programs more effectively for rural participants are proposed. National teacher shortages call rural educators to <b>contemplate</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> that induce teachers to begin their careers in rural schools and to stay there. Factors in rural teacher retention considered in the literature include salary and other conditions of employment (Rude, 1997), characteristics of candidates such as place identification and commitment to a rural lifestyle (Boylan, Sinclair, Smith...|$|R
5000|$|After {{moving to}} Glasgow as a {{teenager}} to find work as a compositor, McHugh {{found himself in a}} city with various possibilities for developing his education as a social reformer. The Irish who had fled to the city in such numbers after the Great Famine were finally starting to organise themselves politically. Native Scots of all classes, especially those Gaels who had come from the Highlands as a result either of the Clearances or the region’s own famine in <b>the</b> 1840s, were <b>contemplating</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> in which <b>the</b> working classes of Glasgow, and other towns in Scotland, were forced to live. As a member of the Glasgow Home Rule Association, and then the secretary of the Glasgow branch of the Irish Land League, McHugh was singled out as a speaker and organiser of ability, and was chosen to lead a Land League mission to the Scottish Highlands in order to direct the nascent crofters’ agitation along radical lines. After the death of the Land League, McHugh toured Scotland with Henry George himself, and helped to found the Scottish Land Restoration League, a body dedicated to taxing land values to their full extent, thereby abolishing landlordism.|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{intelligence}} (AI) is a {{group of}} techniques that have quite a potential to be applied to pavement engineering and management. In this study, we developed a practical, flexible and out of the box approach to apply genetic algorithms to optimizing the budget allocation and the road maintenance strategy selection for a road network. The aim is to provide an alternative to existing software and better fit the requirements of an important number of pavement managers. To meet the objectives, a new indicator, named Road Global Value Index (RGVI), was created to <b>contemplate</b> <b>the</b> pavement <b>condition,</b> <b>the</b> traffic and the economic and political importance for each and every road section. This paper describes the approach and its components by an example confirming that genetic algorithms are very effective for the intended purpose. ...|$|R

Codes are hailed as tools for making law more convenient {{to find and}} to apply than law found in court precedents or in ordinary statutes. Codes are commonplace in most countries. The United States is anomalous. It does not have true codes. In the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries, when many countries adopted systematic civil, criminal and procedural codes, the United States considered, but did not adopt such codes. This Article discusses the absence of codes in American law, identifies American substitutes for codes, relates the history of attempts to create American codes and concludes with observations about the consequences of no-codes. This article is important because it forces us to look at our legal system from a distance as foreign observers do. It makes us <b>contemplate</b> <b>the</b> chaotic <b>conditions</b> that prevail here. It should make us yearn for best practices that prevail elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Architectural {{design in}} our current times has tended to {{generate}} buildings which, despite their aesthetic qualities, frequently prove static, rigid and intractable. The intense and significant production of architecture around the planet has created a situation whereby modification of the existing building stock is costly, difficult and at times implausible. Beginning in the mid-twentieth century architects began to more seriously question narrow design approaches and in response explored more open, mutable and responsive ways of building. Architects such as Kisho Kurokawa and Cedric Price, {{in an effort to}} envision more resilient & robust solutions, explored methods of design and construction which afforded greater user control, modification and customization of environments. As opposed to buildings in which users needed to adapt to environmental constraints, these progressive designers imagined spaces that adjusted to user needs. A significant challenge to these visionaries was a lag between thinking and technology – quite simply construction proved unable to fully address concept. Today the world has changed in dramatic ways, with advancements in technology, expectations of society, and a quest for greater sustainability all driving a push for more agile, adaptable and appropriate Architecture. The present paper critically <b>contemplates</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> of contemporary building design, examines emerging trends, and postulates an innovative model & philosophy for realizing a more responsive, responsible and fitting Architecture for the 21 st Century. While considering historical initiatives, theories and practices, the paper also examines contemporary applications and future possibilities, arguing that many forces hold promise to align in ways before unimaginable. Advancing from the established foundation of Open Building (OB) research and practice, and building upon a holistic and inter-connected strategy (Sinclair 2009) for environmental design, the new model places emphasis and effort on heightened agility, adaptability and appropriateness – all urgently needed {{in our current}}, uncertain and tumultuous times...|$|R

6000|$|Sir Thomas, when he {{was thus}} left, stood for awhile {{with his hands in}} his trousers' pockets, <b>contemplating</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> of his son. It was {{wonderful}} to him that a boy of his should be afflicted in this manner. When he had been struck by the juvenile beauties of Emmeline Dosett he had at once asked the young lady to share his fortunes with him, and the young lady had speedily acceded to his request. Then he had been married, and that was all he had ever known of the troubles of love. He could not but think, looking back at it as he did now from a distance, that had Emmeline been hard-hearted he would have endured the repulse and have passed on speedily to some other charmer. But Tom had been wounded after a fashion which seemed to him to have been very uncommon. It might be possible that he should recover in time, but while undergoing recovery he would be ruined;--so great were the young man's sufferings! Now Sir Thomas, though he had spoken to Tom with all the severity which {{he had been able to}} assume, though he had abused Faddle, and had vindicated the injured dignity of Travers and Treason with all his eloquence; though he had told Tom it was unmanly to give way to his love, yet, of living creatures, Tom was at this moment the dearest to his heart. He had never for an instant entertained the idea of expelling Tom from Travers and Treason because of the policeman, or because of Faddle. What should he do for the poor boy now? Was there any argument, any means of persuasion, by which he could induce that foolish little girl to accept all the good things which he was ready to do for her? Could he try yet once again himself, with any chance of success? ...|$|R
5000|$|He has two children, Monika Saukaitė, a painter, and Mykolas Sauka, a {{sculptor}} and writer. Šarūnas' work, by both critics and laymen, {{is often referred}} to as [...] "different". However, the [...] "difference" [...] in Sauka's paintings is quite consistent. Sauka's imagery is rich with religious symbolism, sharp contrasts of colour, characters and objects in a state of decay. The images of blood, organs, severed body parts and butchery are often found in his paintings. This literal dissection or deformation of the human form is possibly an expression of the author's belief that the human must be stripped from conventional chains in order to <b>contemplate</b> <b>the</b> true <b>condition</b> of its body and soul. In many of his paintings, he uses his own face, sometimes faces of his family members or relatives; the victim and aggressor usually both have the same face. A full appreciation of his artwork requires an understanding of the extent and cruelty of the communist terror in Lithuania and other countries of Eastern Europe and a grasp of some of the underlying metaphysical and archetypal ideas that are basic to his world view and sensibility.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Describe the {{characteristics}} of the evolution of nurses in the medical records of patients admitted to a school hospital in the city of João Pessoa, PB, Brazil. Methods: This is a descriptive, exploratory and documental, embodied in a quantitative approach. The source of study data were the records of patients of the Pediatric Clinic of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases (IPD), who were in the Statistical and Medical Archive Service (SMAS), in a time frame from April to October 2015. The analysis the data was performed, from the descriptive statistics, using a statistical software. Results: Through the data collected, two characteristics were observed in the records: the general aspects and the focus of care. In general aspects, the developments were characterized as being absent from erasures, use of correctives, grammatical errors, non-standard abbreviations and generic terms. They proved to be legible and clear, using scientific terminology, the date and time stamp. However, it was found that there are many blanks. As the focus of care, <b>the</b> records <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> general <b>condition,</b> level of consciousness, respiratory pattern and eliminations. Conclusions: Based on the foregoing, the concreteness of this study shows us that nurses need to be aware in order to provide a more qualified registration and, above all, standardized, ensuring continuity of care and promoting the evaluation of the implemented care...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the more}} puzzling aspects of Kant’s {{political}} thought is his insistence on the duty to obey even oppressive rulers combined with {{his belief in the}} republic as the only rightful constitutional form. In arguing that resisting oppressive power is as wrong as seizing it, Kant seems committed to the awkward position of denouncing as unrightful any attempts made by the people to establish the only rightful form of constitution. Several roads are available for anyone who might be inclined to attempt to dissolve this tension on Kant’s behalf. I will discuss the purpose of <b>the</b> civil <b>condition</b> and <b>the</b> obligation to move to it from the state of nature, arguing {{that the purpose of the}} state for Kant is to secure peace. I also contend that the social contract neither causes the state to exist nor justifies obedience to it. I will proceed to <b>contemplate</b> <b>the</b> civil <b>condition</b> as a state of freedom and, with that in mind, ask two questions about obligation, one relating to the republican form of the state and one to non-republican despotic forms. How can it be that all members of the republic are said to remain free while obligated to law when only a few are granted the law-making citizenship status which is supposed to dissolve the tension between freedom and obligation? How can it be that subjects are obligated to obey an oppressive regime that abuses its authority? These discussions will take us through the role of representation, the people as cause and the status of law, to the state as progressive...|$|R

5000|$|For {{his last}} book, When God Came, Elechi turned {{for the first}} time to the genre of science fiction. Reviewing it, Lindsay Barrett wrote: [...] "When an author has {{attained}} the status of an icon in his profession, based on the publication of works that have been declared iconic masterpieces from the earliest period of his career, it is unusual to find him engaging in experimentation in the latter stages of that career. This is the surprising trajectory that this short but profoundly memorable booklet by the late Elechi Amadi represents. Although the two narrative treatises contained in this work were described by the author as an excursion into the medium of science fiction it would really be more accurate to define them as philosophical allegories. Their contents <b>contemplate</b> <b>the</b> human <b>condition</b> and <b>the</b> limits of the potential for human achievement based on the concept of the supernatural rather than simply being exercises in the conceptualisation of events of an otherworldly nature, which popular science fiction often is. ... In the final analysis these works read like fables from the future that the author must have had immense enjoyment creating.Amadi’s love for literature and his prolific output in his early years overshadowed his scientific background especially after the Civil War when he settled down to work as an educationist and public administrator in Rivers State. It was in this period that he embarked on the experiments in new forms of writing of which this work is a slight but unforgettable example." ...|$|R
