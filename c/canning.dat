5|$|The <b>Canning</b> Reservoir, <b>Canning</b> River and tributaries are {{illegally}} fished for marron, {{especially during}} summer.

Unauthorised camping (including overnight stays and/or outside of designated areas) and unauthorised trail establishment occur more and more frequently in the <b>Canning</b> catchment.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{recreation}} activities occur {{in and around}} the dam and catchment area. <b>Canning</b> Dam features a number of picnic areas (with gas barbecues), look outs and historic walks – many with disabled access. Bushwalking occurs throughout the catchment, particularly along the Bibbulmun Track, which passes through the catchment about 10km upstream of <b>Canning</b> Dam. Several mountain bike trails run either through the <b>Canning</b> National Park or adjacent State Forest areas.|$|E

5|$|Since its {{completion}} in 1940, the <b>Canning</b> Dam {{has contributed to}} a wide range of environmental and ecological problems in surrounding regions, problems include more common algal blooms, habitat loss and sedimentation. Despite these issues, <b>Canning</b> Dam and the adjacent parks and forests provide a variety of recreational activities for the public such as bushwalking, historic walks and picnic facilities.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{construction}} of the <b>Canning</b> Dam, among other drinking water supply dams, water flow into the <b>Canning</b> River has been reduced by up to 96%. A number of freshwater fish species which are endemic to the south-west of Western Australia are found in the <b>Canning</b> River system, however studies of fish and fish habitats in the area have shown that fish numbers are low due to a loss of habitat and a loss of linkage between breeding areas due to low flows, preventing fish migrating upstream and reaching important breeding and nursery grounds. Stagnant water caused by a lack of water flow has provided a suitable habitat for successful breeding of an introduced pest, the mosquitofish.|$|E

5|$|A further {{improvement}} {{was made in}} 1951 when a concrete-lined channel was constructed to divert stream flow from the nearby Kangaroo Gully catchment.

5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} a {{worldwide}} disbandment of British forts as advances in air defence systems caused them to become obsolete.

5|$|At the <b>Canning</b> Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care {{had to be}} taken to prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock and the structure of the dam. At the <b>Canning</b> in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E

5|$|Damming of the <b>Canning</b> caused {{dramatic}} flow reductions {{that significantly}} altered downstream aquatic macroinvertebrate communities.
