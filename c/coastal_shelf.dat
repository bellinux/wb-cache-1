2500|$|Antarctic krill is the {{keystone}} {{species of the}} Antarctic ecosystem beyond the <b>coastal</b> <b>shelf,</b> and provides an important food source for whales, seals, leopard seals, fur seals, crabeater seals, squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other species of birds. Crabeater seals have even developed special teeth as an adaptation to catch this abundant food source: its unusual multilobed teeth enable this species to sieve krill from the water. Its dentition looks like a perfect strainer, but how it operates in detail is still unknown. Crabeaters are the most abundant seal in the world; 98% of their diet {{is made up of}} [...] E. superba. These seals consume over 63 million tonnes of krill each year. Leopard seals have developed similar teeth (45% krill in diet). All seals consume 63–130 million tonnes, all whales 34–43 million tonnes, birds 15–20 million tonnes, squid 30–100 million tonnes, and fish 10–20 million tonnes, adding up to 152–313 million tonnes of krill consumption each year.|$|E
2500|$|Barrow is {{situated}} {{at the tip of}} the Furness peninsula on the north-western edge of Morecambe Bay, south of the Duddon Estuary and east of the Irish Sea. Walney Island, to the west of Barrow, surrounds the peninsula's Irish Sea coast and is separated from Barrow by the narrow Walney Channel. Both Morecambe Bay and the Duddon Estuary are characterized by large areas of quicksand and fast-moving tidal bores. Areas of sand dunes exist on coasts surrounding Barrow, particularly at Roanhead and North Walney. The town centre and major industrial areas sit on a fairly flat <b>coastal</b> <b>shelf,</b> with hillier ground rising to the east of the town, peaking at [...] at Yarlside. Barrow sits on soils deposited during the end of the Ice Age, eroded from the mountains of the Lake District National Park, [...] to the north-east. Barrow's soils are composed of glacial lake clay and glacial till, while Walney is almost entirely made up of reworked glacial morraine. Beneath these soils is a sandstone bedrock, from which many of the town's older buildings are constructed.|$|E

2500|$|A briefly popular theory {{held that}} a 12C-rich comet struck the earth and {{initiated}} the warming event. A cometary impact coincident with the P/E boundary can also help explain some enigmatic features associated with this event, such as the iridium anomaly at Zumaia, the abrupt appearance of kaolinitic clays with abundant magnetic nanoparticles on the <b>coastal</b> <b>shelf</b> of New Jersey, and especially the nearly simultaneous onset of the carbon isotope excursion and the thermal maximum. Indeed, a key feature and testable prediction of a comet impact is that it should produce virtually instantaneous environmental effects in the atmosphere and surface ocean with later repercussions in the deeper ocean. Even allowing for feedback processes, this would require at least 100 gigatons of extraterrestrial carbon. Such a catastrophic impact should have left its mark on the globe. Unfortunately, the evidence put forward does not stand up to scrutiny. An unusual 9-meter-thick clay layer supposedly formed soon after the impact, containing unusual amounts of magnetite, but it formed too slowly for these magnetic particles {{to have been a}} result of the comet's impact. and it turns out they were created by bacteria. [...] However, recent analyses have shown that isolated particles of non-biogenic origin make up the majority of the magnetic particles in the thick clay unit.|$|E
2500|$|After {{four days}} sailing a gale forced Marion to seek shelter at Godhavn where {{the crew was}} granted liberty. To Smith's {{surprise}} diesel fuel was available {{and he took the}} opportunity to fill the ship's fuel tanks. With the unexpected acquisition of fuel, when Marion departed Godhavn, she was able to do so on both engines. After completing a line of sample stations to the north, she returned to top off fuel and water tanks before heading across to Baffin Bay, all the while taking soundings and samples. Samples were taken along the coast of Baffin Island and a [...] line across Davis Strait during the month of August ending at Ivigtut, the site of a cryolite mine that was Greenland's main source of income during that period. After re-provisioning and fueling, she headed back to sea only to be forced to shelter under Mount Kungmat for three days before departing Cape Farewell on a [...] station line to Belle Isle. A storm prevented entering the Strait of Belle Isle so Smith decided to put in at St. John's, Newfoundland, for a liberty and supplies. While en route, Smith managed to run two unscheduled station lines along the Newfoundland <b>coastal</b> <b>shelf.</b> Marion arrived at St. John's on 11 September and departed for New London the next day, her scientific mission accomplished. She arrived at New London on 19 September 1928 after having traveled [...] and taken observations at 191 oceanographic stations with some 2,000 observations of temperature and salinity. Numerous bottom samples had been taken and soundings were added to the charts of the area. The Marion expedition observations demonstrated that pack ice had a direct influence on the drift of icebergs. Heavy pack ice along the Newfoundland and Labrador shelf waters prevented icebergs from being carried to shore and forced them to enter shipping lanes to the south. Little ice on the shelves allowed the icebergs to ground on the Newfoundland coast, where they were harmless. The expedition {{was the beginning of a}} long involvement by the Coast Guard in Greenland and its surrounding waters.|$|E

40|$|Flows on <b>coastal</b> <b>shelves</b> and in {{the deep}} {{interior}} ocean are often considered separately, but transport of fluid between these two regions can have important biologial or environmental consequences. This paper considers a linear coupled coastal and deep interior-ocean model in the idealized context of a homogeneous two-dimensional cylindrical ocean with a rigid lid and axisymmetric step shelf topography. Both a semianalytical mode-matching approach and brute-force finite-element numerics {{have been used to}} analyze the linear dynamics. It is shown that hybrid planetary ?-plane Rossby and topographic shelf modes emerge. The structure of these inviscid modes is clarified by considering their frequency dependence on shelf break radius, by contrasting the evolution of hybrid modes to the evolution of pure shelf and pure ?-plane Rossby modes (considering streamfunction fields and particle paths), and by showing solutions of the initial value problem. Both “ocean” and “laboratory” parameter values are considered. Hybrid modes exchange information between the deep ocean and <b>coastal</b> <b>shelves,</b> especially at the intermediate frequencies where the separate planetary Rossby mode and topographic shelf mode dispersion curves overlap. The role of these modes is particularly clear in an initial value problem wherein a localized initial condition on the southern shelf later leads to large-scale interior ocean circulation. Forced–dissipative calculations reveal the sensitivity of resonantly generated hybrid Rossby–shelf modes to the strength of Ekman damping. For typical oceanic and laboratory parameter values hybrid modes are altered by increasing Ekman damping but do not disappear...|$|R
