In the present study, dynamic reprogramming of histone acetylation and methylation modifications was investigated in the first cell cycle of <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos.</b> Our results demonstrated that part of somatic inherited lysine acetylation on core histones (H 3 K 9, H 3 K 14, H 4 K 16) could be quickly deacetylated following SCNT, and reacetylation occurred following activation treatment. However, acetylation marks of the other lysine residues on core histones (H 4 K 8, H 4 K 12) persisted in the genome of <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> with only mild deacetylation occurring in the process of SCNT and activation treatment.

Further, we tried to improve cloning efficiency by chimeric complementation of <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> with blastomeres from in vivo fertilized or parthenogenetic embryos. The levels of acH 3 K 9 / 14 were higher in RCCs than in RFFs (P! 0. 05).

40|$|Epigenetic {{reprogramming}} plays {{a central}} role in the development of <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer, and it is believed that aberrant reprogramming leads to the abnormal development of most <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos.</b> Recent studies show that trimethylation of H 3 K 27 (H 3 K 27 me 3) contributes to the maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency because the differentiation genes are always occupied by nucleosomes trimethylated at H 3 K 27, which represses gene expression. Here, we provide evidence that differential H 3 K 27 me 3 modification exists between normal fertilization-produced blastocysts and somatic cell nuclear transfer cloned blastocysts; H 3 K 27 me 3 was specifically found in cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) of normal blastocysts, whereas there was no modification of H 3 K 27 me 3 in the ICM of cloned blastocysts. Subsequently, we demonstrated that the differentiation-related genes, which are marked by H 3 K 27 me 3 in embryonic stem cells, were expressed at significantly higher levels in <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> than in normal embryos. The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC 2) component genes (Eed, Ezh 2, and Suz 12), which are responsible for the generation of H 3 K 27 me 3, were expressed at lower levels in the <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos.</b> Our results suggest that reduced expression of PRC 2 component genes in <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> results in defective modification of H 3 K 27 me 3 to the differentiation-related genes in pluripotent ICM cells.

Because a cell's ability to differentiate is greatly enhanced if it is surrounded by more cells differentiating the same way, a concept designated community effect by Gurdon, we reasoned that the insufficient cell numbers often observed in <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> might lead to premature Cdx 2 expression and differentiation of blastomeres into trophectoderm.

Further-more, scriptaid treatment of cloned embryos further increased the frequency of development to blastocyst, compared to the control reconstructed with the same extract-treated cells (22. 5 – 0. 9 % vs. 15. 3 – 0. 9 %, p < 0. 01). In addition, egg extract treatments increased the cell number in the blastocysts. This study demonstrated that Xenopus egg extract treatment reduced donor cell DNA methylation and enhanced the SCNT embryo develop-ment. Moreover, the combined treatments of donor cells with egg extract before nuclear transfer and of cloned embryos with scriptaid could improve <b>cloned</b> <b>embryo</b> development additively.

40|$|Cloned mouse embryos {{display a}} marked {{preference}} for glucose-contain-ing culture medium, with enhanced development to the blastocyst stage in glucose-containing medium attributable mainly {{to an early}} beneficial effect during the first cell cycle. This early beneficial effect of glucose is not displayed by parthenogenetic, fertilized, or tetraploid nuclear transfer control embryos, indicating that it is specific to diploid clones. Precocious localization of the glucose transporter SLC 2 A 1 to the cell surface, as well as increased expression of glucose transporters and increased uptake of glucose at the one- and two-cell stages, is also seen in cloned embryos. To examine the role of glucose in early <b>cloned</b> <b>embryo</b> development, we examined glucose metabolism and associated metabolites, as well as mitochondrial ultrastructure, distribution, and number. Clones prepared with cumulus cell nuclei displayed significantly enhanced glucose me-tabolism at the two-cell stage relative to parthenogenetic controls. Despite the increase in metabolism, ATP content was reduced in clones relativ...|$|E
40|$|Cloning {{methods in}} mice are now well {{described}} and are becoming routine. However, the frequency at which cloned mice are produced remains below 5 %, {{irrespective of the}} nucleus donor species or cell type. Only a few laboratories have made clones from adult mouse somatic cells and most strains have never produced cloned mice. On the other hand, nuclear transfer {{can be used to}} generate human embryonic stem (ntES) cell lines from a patient's own somatic cells. It has been shown that such cells can be generated relatively easily from a variety of mouse genotypes and cell types of both sexes, even though it may be more difficult to generate clones directly. This technique could be used in regenerative medicine and, in theory, in infertility clinics to treat completely infertile individuals. However, these results suggest that the reprogramming integrity of each <b>cloned</b> <b>embryo</b> differs: some cloned embryos can be converted to ntES cells, but these embryos cannot achieve full term development. This review outlines the nature of genomic reprogramming potential and its application, and suggests new approaches to avoid the ethical problems of creating embryos by nuclear transfer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cross-species nuclear {{transfer}} {{has been shown}} to be a potent approach to retain the genetic viability of a certain species near extinction. However, most embryos produced by cross-species {{nuclear transfer}} were compromised because that they were unable to develop to later stages. Gene expression analysis of cross-species <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> will yield new insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved in cross-species nuclear transfer and embryonic development. Results A novel gene, K 31, was identified as an up-regulated gene in fish cross-subfamily <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> using SSH approach and RACE method. K 31 complete cDNA sequence is 1106 base pairs (bp) in length, with a 342 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative protein of 113 amino acids (aa). Comparative analysis revealed no homologous known gene in zebrafish and other species database. K 31 protein contains a putative transmembrane helix and five putative phosphorylation sites but without a signal peptide. Expression pattern analysis by real time RT-PCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) shows that it has the characteristics of constitutively expressed gene. Sub-cellular localization assay shows that K 31 protein can not penetrate the nuclei. Interestingly, over-expression of K 31 gene can cause lethality in the epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells in cell culture, which gave hint to the inefficient reprogramming events occurred in <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos.</b> Conclusion Taken together, our findings indicated that K 31 gene is a novel gene differentially expressed in fish cross-subfamily <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> and over-expression of K 31 gene can cause lethality of cultured fish cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the determination of novel genes involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic interaction of fish cross-subfamily <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Cloning animals by nuclear {{transfer}} (NT) {{has been successful}} in several mammalian species. In addition to cloning live animals (reproductive cloning), this technique has also been used in several species to establish cloned embryonic stem (ntES) cell lines from somatic cells. It is the latter application of this technique that has been heralded as being the potential means to produce isogenic embryonic stem cells from patients for cell therapy (therapeutic cloning). These two types of cloning differ only in the steps after <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> are produced: for reproductive <b>cloning</b> the <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> are transferred to surrogate mothers to allow them to develop to full term and for therapeutic <b>cloning</b> the <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> are used to derive ntES cells. In this chapter, a detailed NT protocol in mouse by using somatic stem cells (neuron and skin stem cells) and fully differentiated somatic cells (cumulus cells and fibroblast cells) as nuclear donors is described...|$|R
