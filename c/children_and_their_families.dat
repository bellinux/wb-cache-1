5|$|In early 2001, the Workshop {{conducted}} a summative study {{about the effects}} of war, natural disasters, and other events on young children.

5|$|The show's {{goals for}} {{outreach}} were addressed {{through a series}} of programs that first focused on promotion and then, after the first season, on the development of educational materials used in preschool settings. Innovative programs were developed because their target audience, <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> in low-income, inner-city homes, did not traditionally watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{tradition}} (started in 1987) is Dunster by Candlelight {{which takes place}} every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns its back on the present and lights its streets with candles.

The procession of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> is accompanied by colourful stilt walkers in costumes who put up the lanterns.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} non-malignant life-threatening illness in childhood and associated morbidity in the affected <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting Bath Clinical Area (total population 411 800). Subjects Children aged 0 - 19 years. Results One hundred <b>and</b> twenty-three <b>children</b> were identified, giving a prevalence of 1. 2 / 1000 children. Morbidity assessed in 93 children showed 60 % in pain or discomfort, 35 % unable to walk and 25 % with severe cognitive impairment. Mental health problems were found in 54 % of mothers and 30 % of fathers, and significant emotional and behavioural problems in 24 % of healthy siblings. Conclusions Non-malignant life-threatening illness is more prevalent than reported in previous studies. Considerable morbidity is experienced by the <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family.</b> An individual <b>and</b> family approach is required. Key messages (1) The prevalence of non-malignant life-threatening illness is four times greater than previous estimates. (2) This group of conditions have significant implications for all family members. (3) Early comprehensive assessment and access to effective interventions may pre-empt later problems...|$|R
