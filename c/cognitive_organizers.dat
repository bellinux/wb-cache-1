40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct a {{systematic}} replica-tion of a previous study (Boon, Burke, Fore, & Spencer, 2006) on the effects of computer-generated <b>cognitive</b> <b>organizers</b> using Inspiration 6 software versus a traditional textbook instruction format on students ’ ability to comprehend social studies content information in high school inclusive social studies classes. A major goal was to strengthen the results of the previous study by using its control group as the treatment group and its treatment group as the control group in the current study. After ensuring that no carry-over effects from the previous study existed, the groups were “flipped, ” and using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest group design, 26 tenth-grade students in general educa-tion and 18 students with mild disabilities received instruction using a computerized cognitive organizer or traditional text-book instruction format. Dependent measures included a 45 -item open-ended production pre-/posttest of declarative social studies knowledge to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Results showed that students in the computerized cognitive organizer condition significantly outperformed students in the traditional textbook instruction condition...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of two modes of prereading assistance on fifth-graders' literal and interpretive comprehension of selected material. Readers of average ability were considered. The two modes of prereading assistance studies were Directed Reading Question introductions (tape-recorded prereading assistance given pupils which set purposes for reading by having them read to find answers for specific questions) and <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Organizer</b> introductions (tape-recorded prereading assistance given pupils which included both general information about the topic and a preview of the sequence of events in the passage). Additionally, one-third of the pupils were given no prereading assistance and were used as the Control group. From an original population of all fifth-grade pupils reading on grade level in Anderson, Indiana's twenty-eight elementary schools, fifth-graders in three representative schools were chosen by the Assistant Superintendent. All fifth-graders in these three schools (159 subjects) were given Ransom's Cloze Test as an initial screening device. Those students scoring between fourth and seventh-grade instructional level, inclusive, on the Cloze Test were individually administered the Silvaroli Classroom Reading Inventory. Of the fifth-graders found to have an instructional reading level of fifth-grade, sixty-three were randomly divided into three groups, the Directed Reading Question group, the <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Organizer</b> group, and the Control group. The Directed Reading Question and <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Organizer</b> groups listened to the appropriate tape-recorded introductions before reading each of the three reading passages (three-selections from SPA Kit IIIb), and then answered the posttest questions over each passage. The Control group received no prereading assistance before reading the passages and answering the posttest questions. All materials, the introductions, passages, and fifteen literal and fifteen interpretive subtest questions were validated by a panel of reading experts. Additionally, all materials were field tested with fifth-graders reading on grade level from a fourth representative Anderson School. Kuder-Richardson- 20 reliability estimates for the subtests were. 69 and. 78. Total posttest was. 85. Nine null hypotheses were tested using Bonferroni t procedures and multivariate and univariate analysis. Using the. 05 level of confidence as the predetermined criterion, six of the nine null hypotheses were rejected. On the total posttest, the scores of the three groups were significantly different. The students who received the <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Organizer</b> introductions scored significantly higher than the other two groups on the total post-test. The Directed Reading Question group scored significantly higher than the Control group on the total posttest. In the three cases involving individual subtests where the null hypothesis was not rejected (those comparing the DRQ and CO groups on the literal and interpretive subtests and that comparing the DRQ group and CG on the interpretive subtest), existing differences, though not statistically significant, favored the <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Organizer</b> group over both the other two groups, and the Directed Reading Question group over the Control group. The findings of this study indicate in general that for these particular students, subject to the limitations of this investigation, the <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Organizer</b> type of introduction was superior to the Directed Reading Question type of introduction and to giving no introductions at all. Giving the Directed Reading Question introductions was more facilitative than giving no prereading assistance. While the results for the individual subtests were statistically significant in only three of the six cases, all existing differences favored the <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Organizer</b> treatment over the other two treatments, and the Directed Reading Question treatment over the Control treatment. It would appear that under the limitations of this study, students benefited most by being exposed to introductions which gave both general information about the topic and a preview of the sequence of events in the passage. Those who listened to the Directed Reading Questions and read to find answers for specific questions did better than those who were asked to read the passages without being provided any "mind-set" for the selections.

40|$|The mammary {{pheromone}} {{promotes the}} acquisition of novel odorants (CS 1) in newborn rabbits. Here, experiments pinpoint that CS 1 becomes able to support neonatal learning of other odorants (CS 2). We therefore evaluated whether these first- and second-order memories remained dependent after reactivation. Amnesia induced after CS 2 recall selectively blocked this memory, when recall and amnesia of CS 1 left the souvenir of CS 2 safe; this finding partially differed from results obtained in adult mammals. Thus, in this model of neonatal appetitive odor learning, second-order memory seems to depend on first-order memory for its formation but not for its maintenance. The mammary pheromone (MP) emitted by lactating rabbit females helps newborn rabbits to orient to the mother, then rap-idly to localize and grasp the nipples (Coureaud 2001; Schaal et al. 2003). It is a determinant for survival and growth {{in the context of}} mother–young interactions daily limited (, 5 min) (Zarrow et al. 1965). The MP also acts as a <b>cognitive</b> <b>organizer</b> promoting the rapid (single trial) appetitive learning of new odor stimuli, ini-tially neutral. After pairing with the MP, the learned stimulus gains significance (i. e., releases the sucking behavior of neonates...|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} formalism {{in quantum}} mechanics gives {{meaning to the}} physical concepts and entities, as the birth and the historic evolution of quantum theory tell us, {{as well as it}} is evidenced by the entanglement between the different interpretations of the theory and the formal aspects of the theory itself. Concepts characterizing quantum mechanics, as quantum entanglement or non-locality, were recognized and really understood in their implications only after the formulation of quantum theory. Teaching quantum mechanics in upper secondary school cannot leave out the consideration of the interlacing between formalism and concepts. On this peculiar point there are centered pilot experimentations in Italian last year upper secondary school classes. The experimentations are carried out following a learning/teaching quantum mechanics proposal developed in previous researches. According to this proposal students face quantum knots and concepts in the phenomenological context of light polarization. The aim of the proposal is the construction of the formal thinking creating a challenging educational environment in which student explore hypothesis and, step by step, build a coherent interpretation of the specific phenomenology explored, generalizing the results in other contexts. From analysis of students learning path many indications emerged on how students use the vectorial representation of state as <b>cognitive</b> <b>organizer</b> of state concept. Moreover the linear operator representation of observables was used as an instrument to yield the quantum description of microscopic systems. The integration of these results with phenomenographic studies on classical vs quantum conceptions developed by students showed diverse grades of coherences of the conceptual students schemas and the formal ones...|$|R
40|$|First, the {{construct}} of comprehensibility is explicated as a theoretical framework for techniques leading to optimally comprehensible texts. The explication accentuates the problem of pedagogical prescription inherent in the objective of an 2 ̆ 7 Optimum of Comprehensibility 2 ̆ 7; consequences for possibilities of optimal textual organization are discussed (objective: medium comprehensibility, competent reader). Concrete text features and organizational aids leading to an optimum of comprehensibility are presented {{in the second part}} of this article. The following features explored by classical instructional research are discussed with regard to practical application: Gra&# 305;nmatical and Stylistic Simplicity, Conciseness/Redundancy, <b>Cognitive</b> Structure/Organization (advance <b>organizer,</b> sequencing, su&# 305;nmaries, typographical cueing, headings, inserted questions, learning objectives), and Motivational Stirnulance. The explication of text features given by instructional psychology is regarded as incomplete. It seems possible to differentiate and explicate features of cornprehensibility more precisely by integrating it into cognitive models of text processing (propositional ar&# 305;d macropropositional models,schema theory and mental models), which are discussed in a final chapter...|$|R
