Lumenick wrote, [...] "this is a big, dumb summer movie with no {{apparent}} ambition other than plugging a hole in a studio’s schedule because its faded star happened to be available for a few weeks." [...] American film critic and professor Emanuel Levy was critical of the film's writing, calling it a [...] "mindless flick"; he noted, [...] "The story moves at a breakneck speed, as if to conceal the incongruities in the storytelling." [...] Levy gave the film a grade of [...] "C", and commented, [...] "Preposterously plotted, the saga is dominated by long, energetic, uneven action sequences, but it lacks any logic and pays minimal attention to characterization. Repetitious in structure, and with humor that more often than not misses the mark, 'Knight and Day' is characterized by nihilistic violence and amoral tone, which wouldn't have mattered had the movie been witty or fun to watch." [...] Simon Abrams of Slant Magazine gave the film a rating of two stars out of four, and commented of the film's director and writer, [...] "Clearly O'Neill and Mangold are trying to give viewers what producers would undoubtedly like to sell as 'something for everybody,' but there's no consistency to the thing and no chemistry whatsoever between Cruise and Diaz, making the alternating tug-of-war between girly and manly elements of the film seem extraordinarily forced." [...] In a review published in The Victoria Advocate, Robert Philpot of McClatchy Newspapers called the movie [...] "disposable", and singled out the film's script as its [...] "biggest problem", commenting that it [...] "feels lazy right from its lame-pun title". The Miami Herald film critic Rene Rodriguez wrote that there was [...] "no chemistry between Cruise and Diaz", and commented regarding Cruise's acting, [...] "Tom Cruise spends much of 'Knight and Day' looking as if he's waiting for someone to pour <b>casting</b> <b>mold</b> over his head to make an action figure." ...|$|E

30|$|<b>Cast</b> <b>molding</b> {{process has}} {{provided}} a reliable, simple and cost-effective way to fabricate micro structures since decades ago. In order to obtain structures with fine, dense and deep nano-size features by <b>cast</b> <b>molding,</b> {{it is necessary to}} study the forming mechanism in the process. In this paper, based on major steps of <b>cast</b> <b>molding,</b> filling models of liquid are established and solved; and the forming mechanism of liquid is revealed. Moreover, the scale effect between the liquid and the cavity on the filling velocity of liquid is studied. It is also interesting to find out that the wettability of liquid on the cavity may be changed from wetting to dewetting depends on the pressure difference. Finally, we experimentally verify some of our modeling results on the flowing and filling state of the liquid during the <b>cast</b> <b>molding</b> process.|$|R

50|$|Belt Preheating: For {{wide strip}} casting, a belt {{preheating}} {{system can be}} used to bring the belt up to 150 °C or higher immediately prior to entering the <b>casting</b> <b>mold,</b> reducing the effects of cold framing. Induction heating coils can be used across the width to preheat each belt. In addition to preventing thermal distortion, the high preheat temperature serves to eliminate any moisture present on the belt surface.|$|E

Lottermoser, a German, wrote a paper on 'das Ausfrieren von Hydrosolen' (the Freezing of Hydrosols) in 1908. Through the 20th century various people have patented techniques using freeze-gelation, most being centred on the use of ceramics as refractory materials. A furnace lining brick, or an investment <b>casting</b> <b>mold,</b> can be easily fabricated using this method.|$|E

40|$|Husqvarna is a Swedish company {{producing}} {{products for}} forestry, park and gardens. Due to harder competition {{they wish to}} increase efficacy in production. This {{can be achieved by}} shorter lead-times in the complex process of making <b>casting</b> <b>molds.</b> Activities within this process have certain relations and dependencies between each other that can be analyzed by using a Dependence Structure Matrix. The Dependence Structure Matrix is a tool that can improve efficiency by rearranging activities according to how they are dependent of each other. The purpose is to make a Dependence Structure Matrix of activities that Husqvarna can use to analyze dependencies within the process of <b>cast</b> <b>molding.</b> The DSM Matrix will propose restructured activities of the process which can be evaluated to determine if greater efficacy can be reached. To determine the activities within the process of making <b>cast</b> <b>molds</b> a workshop at Husqvarna for the people involved was conducted. A matrix has been constructed based on the information of activities and their dependencies. This information has then been analyzed by the software Multiplan. The process of making <b>casting</b> <b>molds</b> could be analyzed by the DSM/DMM approach. A new order of how to carry out activities is the outcome of the analysis. The result can be analyzed by Husqvarna in order to determine if greater efficacy can be reached...|$|R

However, in shell <b>mold</b> <b>casting,</b> the <b>mold</b> is a thin-walled shell created from applying a sand-resin mixture around a pattern. The pattern, a metal {{piece in the}} shape of the desired part, is reused to form multiple shell molds.

It is highlighted in the work of Ye et al. [59] that polymer <b>cast</b> <b>molds</b> (typically made of PDMS) are usually more preferable in the UV-based roller imprinting process due to their advantages of being low cost, low surface energy (fewer sticking issues), chemically inert, elastic, and simpler to produce as compared to metal molds.|$|R
5000|$|They ingeniously took {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} melting temperature of copper (which is around 1000C) was lower than the casting temperature of iron (1150 to 1200C), so that just a bit after the iron core had cooled, they could then, using a clay or wax <b>casting</b> <b>mold,</b> add molten bronze to the iron core. In this way, the shrinkage that attended the cooling of the external brass would the iron, which would enable the tube to be able to resist intense firing pressure.|$|E
5000|$|A riser, {{also known}} as a feeder, is a {{reservoir}} built into a metal <b>casting</b> <b>mold</b> to prevent [...] due to shrinkage. Most metals are less dense as a liquid than as a solid so castings shrink upon cooling, which can leave a void at the last point to solidify. Risers prevent this by providing molten metal to the casting as it solidifies, so that the cavity forms in the riser and not the casting. Risers are not effective on materials that have a large freezing range, because directional solidification is not possible. They are also not needed for casting processes that utilized pressure to fill the mold cavity. A feeder operated by a treadle is called an underfeeder.|$|E

40|$|Casting had {{symbolic}} {{significance and}} was strictly controlled in the Shang dynasty of ancient China. Vessel casting was mainly distributed around the Shang capital, Yin Ruins, which indicates a rigorous centralization of authority. Thus, for a <b>casting</b> <b>mold</b> to be excavated {{far from the}} capital region is rare. In addition to some bronze vessel molds excavated at the Buyao Village site, another key discovery of a bronze vessel mold occurred at Daxinzhuang. The Daxinzhuang site was a core area in the east of Shang state and is an important site to study the eastward expansion of the Shang. Here, combining synchrotron X-rays and other physicochemical analysis methods, nondestructive three-dimensional structure imaging and different elemental analyses were conducted on this mold sherd. Through high penetration X-ray tomography, we obtained insights on the internal structure and discovered some pores. We infer that the generation of pores inside the <b>casting</b> <b>mold</b> sherd was used to enhance air permeability during casting. Furthermore, we suppose that the decorative patterns on the surface were carved and not pasted onto it. Considering the previous compositional studies of bronze vessels, the copper and iron elements were analyzed by different methods. Unexpectedly, a larger amount of iron than of copper was detected on the surface.
