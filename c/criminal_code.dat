5|$|In 2005, the 22-officer Dawson Creek Royal Canadian Mounted Police {{municipal}} detachment reported 2,561 <b>Criminal</b> <b>Code</b> offences. This {{translated into}} a crime rate of 225 <b>Criminal</b> <b>Code</b> offences per 1,000 people, down from the previous year's rate of 231, but still {{much higher than the}} provincial average of 125. In 2004, per 1,000 people, the city had higher crime rates compared to the provincial averages on all <b>Criminal</b> <b>Code</b> offences except theft from motor vehicles (19.8 city, 20.2 province), heroin-related offences (0 city, 0.13 province), and murder (0 city, 0.03 province). The city had slightly higher but comparable levels of offensive weapons charges, cannabis-related offences, robbery, and motor vehicle thefts. Per 1,000 people, the city had much higher levels of shoplifting (13.8 city, 4.2 province), cocaine-related offences (7.8 city, 1.4 province), commercial break-and-enters (11.2 city, 4.2 province), residential break-and-enters (13.9 city, 6.0 province), and non-sexual assaults (26.2 city, 9.9 province).|$|E
5|$|Section 1 was {{supplemented}} by an omnibus treason law during the Civil War, which, inter alia, provided for punishments other than death and additional lesser offenses. The offense of treason, and the punishment thereof, were codified in consecutive {{sections of the}} Revised Statutes. Both were repealed and replaced by the <b>Criminal</b> <b>Code</b> of 1909. During the 1948 re-codification of the <b>Criminal</b> <b>Code,</b> the treason offense was amended and moved to 18 U.S.C. § 2381, where it remains. It was amended in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Section 5 of the 1819 act {{was set to}} sunset {{at the end of}} {{the next}} session of Congress.

Section 8 of the Crimes Act of 1790, § 5 of the 1819 act, and § 3 of the 1820 act were all separately codified in the Revised Statutes in 1874.

5|$|Section 8 was amended in 1820, 1835, and 1846 and codified in five {{sections}} of the Revised Statutes.

Despite the similarity of the provisions, all three were all separately codified in the Revised Statutes in 1874. Section 8 was repealed by the <b>Criminal</b> <b>Code</b> of 1909.

5|$|After a brief {{preliminary}} hearing starting on 8 October 1966, during which Lamb reportedly {{showed no signs}} of emotion, the young man's trial for capital murder began on 16 January 1967 at Essex County Courthouse in Windsor. Because of the charge's severity, the case was heard by a judge and jury under the auspices of Ontario's Supreme Court, which chose Justice Alexander Stark to preside. The trial started with Lamb pleading not guilty to the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski and Andrew Woloch; Nosanchuk then opened his mental disorder defence under Section 562 of the Canadian <b>Criminal</b> <b>Code.</b> Stark gave an order allowing all relevant psychiatric doctors to remain, then allowed the Crown to open its case against Lamb.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{pressed to}} reform the state's <b>criminal</b> <b>code,</b> {{which was based on}} the English system and imposed the death penalty for over 200 {{different}} crimes. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing the death penalty for every crime except first-degree murder.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Canadian Gaming Association {{commissioned}} {{an opinion}} on the legality of DFS in Canada from former Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario general counsel Don Bourgeois. He determined that DFS would likely be classified as a game of chance under Canadian law, going on to say {{in an interview that}} under the <b>Criminal</b> <b>Code</b> of Canada, games that mix chance- and skill-based elements are considered games of chance. However, Canadian authorities have not yet targeted DFS services; historically, the government has only targeted illegal gambling operations that have a presence within the country. While the service Sport Select offers legal sports wagering games through Canada's lotteries, it is subject to a legal prohibition on wagering on individual sporting events.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in Covington, Stevenson was elected county attorney for Kenton County. He was chosen as a delegate to the 1844 Democratic National Convention and was elected to represent Kenton County in the Kentucky House of Representatives the following year. He was reelected in 1846 and 1848. In 1849, he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention that produced Kentucky's third state constitution. In 1850, he, Madison C. Johnson, and James Harlan were appointed as commissioners to revise Kentucky's civic and <b>criminal</b> <b>code.</b> Their work, Code of Practise in Civil and Criminal Cases was published in 1854. He was again one of Kentucky's delegates to the Democratic National Conventions in 1848, 1852, and 1856, serving as a presidential elector in 1852 and 1856.|$|E

The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge was {{appointed}} as the state's attorney general soon after arriving. In November 1797, he resigned and {{was elected to}} the Kentucky House of Representatives the next month. As a legislator, he secured passage of a more humane <b>criminal</b> <b>code</b> that abolished the death penalty for all offenses except first-degree murder. On a 1798 trip to Virginia, an intermediary gave him Thomas Jefferson's Kentucky Resolutions, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts. At Jefferson's request, Breckinridge assumed credit for the modified resolutions he shepherded through the Kentucky General Assembly; Jefferson's authorship was not discovered until after Breckinridge's death. He opposed calling a state constitutional convention in 1799 but was elected as a delegate. Due to his influence, the state's government remained comparatively aristocratic, maintaining protections for slavery and limiting the power of the electorate. Called the father of the resultant constitution, he emerged from the convention as the acknowledged leader of the state's Democratic-Republican Party and was selected Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1799 and 1800.|$|E
