40|$|The {{emergence}} of vitamin D deficiency {{as a global}} epidemic coupled with its nonskeletal effects has recently garnered {{lot of interest in}} the medical fraternity. This “sun vitamin ” deficiency is related to the limited <b>cutaneous</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> inadequate sun exposure, pigmented skin and inadequate dietary intake. The crucial role of the vitamin D in calcium metabolism physiology and its association with increased risk of CVD, autoimmune diseases, cancers, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and infectious diseases has gained attention. In this article we will focus on the relationship between vitamin D statuses on the cardiovascular system.

30|$|In conclusion, {{the present}} results clearly {{demonstrated}} volatility of nC 60 effect on the mycotoxigenic potential of A. flavus. It may stimulate aflatoxin <b>synthesis</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> prooxidative action on the fungal cell, as detected with 50  ng/mL. An antiaflatoxigenic effect was observed at both 10 – 100  ng/mL nC 60, with disparate mechanisms of action. An apparent antioxidative effect of 10  ng/mL nC 60 reduced biosynthesis of aflatoxins (Reverberi et al. 2005), while 100  ng/mL nC 60 exerted both prooxidative (measured) and cytotoxic (assumed) effects in fungal cells, thus effectively shutting down aflatoxin biosynthesis and/or their release from the cell. Further studies should extend the range of tested nC 60 levels, investigate behaviour of photosensitised fullerene, and response of mycotoxigenic fungi in environmental conditions which are expected <b>to</b> favour aflatoxin <b>synthesis</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> climate change (Battilani et al. 2016; Medina et al. 2017).|$|R

There is colocalization between phosphorylated eIF2α and cytosolic cytochrome c, which is released from mitochondria in apoptosis. Phosphorylated Eif2-alpha appeared before cytochrome c release, suggesting that phosphorylation of eIF2α triggers cytochrome c release during apoptotic cell death.|$|R
