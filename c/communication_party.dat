40|$|Mobility in {{wireless}} networks {{causes a}} major issue from the IP-addressing perspective. When a Mobile Node (MN) moves to another subnet, it will probably get assigned a new IP address. This causes a routing problem since the MN will not be reachable with its previous IP address known to the other <b>communication</b> <b>party.</b> Real time applications might suffer from connection drops, which is recognized as inconvenience in the currently used service, unless some solution is provided. An approach to maintain session continuity while traversing heterogeneous networks of different subnet addresses is proposed.

40|$|The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{protocols}} for multimedia control over the Internet, including initiating, maintaining and terminating multimedia sessions. The protocol uses transactions to complete the control tasks. In this paper we focus on the INVITE transaction of SIP, which is used to initiate a session. SIP is designed to operate over a transport protocol that can be reliable or unreliable. Our previous work has verified the functional properties of the INVITE transaction over a reliable transport medium, using Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs). In this paper, we use CPNs to model and analyse SIP INVITE transaction when the medium is unreliable. The verification reveals similar problem as that in the case of a reliable medium, i. e. the transaction may terminate in an undesirable state while one <b>communication</b> <b>party</b> is still waiting for a response from its peer. Additionally with an unreliable medium, the transaction has undesirable terminal states in which retransmitted requests may lead to erroneous operation.

However, TCP’s high processing overhead and redundant data copies remain a major bottleneck for applications to fully benefit from such high speed technology.

Although RDMA based designs have been proposed to improve network file I/O protocols in several previous works, its benefit for cluster file system block I/O is not clear yet. We propose a new technique – “buffer management delegation”, which offloads message buffer management to remote <b>communication</b> <b>party.</b> Using this technique, we design our zero copy RDMA based block transfer scheme for GNBD (Global Network Block Device), a block access protocol of Red Hat Global File System, to optimize cluster file system performance over 10 Gbps InfiniBand network.

The evaluation quantifies the redundant copy impact for both bulk data transfer and file system meta-data operations.

The most important interfaces, which I described here, are Gm, Mw, Cx, Dx and Sh. Then I focused on security in IMS problems, which are divided into categories of access security and network security.

40|$|Abstract. Fresh re-keying {{is a type}} of {{protocol}} {{which aims}} at splitting the task of protecting an encryption/authentication scheme against side-channel attacks in two parts. One part, a re-keying function, has to satisfy a mini-mum set of properties (such as good diffusion), and is based on an algebraic structure that is easy to protect against side-channel attacks with counter-measures such as masking. The other part, a block cipher, brings resistance against mathematical cryptanalysis, and only has to be secure against single-measurement attacks. Since fresh re-keying schemes are cheap and stateless, they are convenient to use in practice and do not require any synchronization between communication parties. However, {{it has been shown that}} their first in-stantiation (from Africacrypt 2010) only provides birthday security because of a (mathematical only) collision-based key recovery attack recently put forward by Dobraunig et al. (CARDIS 2014). In this paper, we provide two provably secure (in the ideal cipher model) solutions to avoid such collision attacks. The first one is based on classical block ciphers, but does not achieve beyond-birthday CPA security (i. e. it only provably prevents the CARDIS 2014 key recovery attack) and requires an additional block cipher execution in the pro-tocol. The second one is based on tweakable block ciphers and provides tight CPA security while also being more efficient. As a complement, we also show that our reasoning extends to hybrid schemes, where the <b>communication</b> <b>party</b> to protect against side-channel attacks is stateful. We illustrate this claim by describing a collision attack against an example of a hybrid scheme patented by Kocher, and presenting a tweak leading to beyond birthday security. We conclude the paper by discussing the use of fresh/hybrid re-keying for encryp-tion and authentication, together with a cautionary note on their side-channel resistance. ...|$|E
