5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} <b>connected</b> graph is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition.

A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself a cut. A minimal cutset of a <b>connected</b> graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component. A simple cycle is a <b>connected</b> subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>connecting</b> rod {{is a major}} link {{inside of}} a {{combustion}} engine. It <b>connects</b> the piston to the crankshaft and is responsible for transferring power from the piston to the crankshaft and sending it to the transmission. There are different types of materials and production methods used {{in the creation of}} <b>connecting</b> rods. The most common types of materials used for <b>connecting</b> rods are steel and aluminum. <b>Connecting</b> rods are widely used in variety of engines such as, in-line engines, V-engine, opposed cylinder engines, radial engines and oppose-piston engines. For the project work we have selected <b>connecting</b> rod used in light commercial vehicle of tata motors had recently been launched in the market. We used PRO-E wildfire 4. 0 software for modeling of <b>connecting</b> rod and ANSYS 11 software for analysis. ANSYS Workbench module had been used for analysis of <b>connecting</b> rod. We found out the stresses developed in <b>connecting</b> rod under static loading with different loading conditions of compression and tension at crank end and pin end of <b>connecting</b> rod. We have also designed the <b>connecting</b> rod by machine design approach. Design of <b>connecting</b> rod which is designed by machine design approach is compared with actual production drawing of <b>connecting</b> rod.

40|$|Abstract- Every {{vehicle that}} uses an {{internal}} combustion engine requires at least one <b>connecting</b> rod depending upon the number of cylinders in the engine. <b>Connecting</b> rod is a structural member in the engine, which transfers reciprocating motion in to rotary motion of crank shaft. The <b>connecting</b> rod while transferring the power from piston to crank shaft takes load from piston due to combustion process in the combustion chamber and inertia forces of the reciprocating parts (piston & <b>connecting</b> rod) due to this the <b>connecting</b> rod may fail. The inertia effect of the <b>connecting</b> rod will also reduce the power transmission. Hence the <b>connecting</b> rod is analyzed for reducing the inertia effect due to reciprocating parts i. e. <b>connecting</b> rod. In this project the analysis is done on <b>connecting</b> rod with traditional material i. e. grey cast iron and a new alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) for optimizing the weight to reduce the inertia forces due to <b>connecting</b> rod for this process pro-e package is used to model the <b>connecting</b> rod & ansys- 11. 0 is used {{to carry out the}} analysis of <b>connecting</b> rod...|$|R
40|$|The <b>connecting</b> rod {{forms an}} {{integral}} part of an internal combustion engine. It acts as a linkage between piston and crank shaft. The main function of <b>connecting</b> rod is to transmit the translational motion of piston to rotational motion of crank shaft. The function of the <b>connecting</b> rod also involves transmitting the thrust of the piston to the <b>connecting</b> rod. <b>Connecting</b> rod used in automotive engines is a critical component which comes under the influence of different types of loads in operation. Fatigue loading is one of the prime causes contributing to its failure. Failure and damage are also more in <b>connecting</b> rod, so stress analysis in <b>connecting</b> rod is very important. In this study, detailed load analysis was performed on <b>connecting</b> rod, followed by finite element method in Ansys. In this regard, in order to calculate stress in different part of <b>connecting</b> rod, the total forces exerted <b>connecting</b> rod were calculated and then it was modeled, meshed and loaded in Ansys software.
