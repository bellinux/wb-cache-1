40|$|The {{title of}} this diploma thesis is as follows: CMNI in theory and its {{practical}} implementation in the Danube region. CMNI stands for "Budapest Convention on the Contract for the Carriage of Goods <b>by</b> <b>Inland</b> <b>Waterway.</b> " This convention was adopted in a diplomatic conference in 2000. It entered into force in the year 2005. So far, it has been ratified by 15 European countries. All countries with connection to the Danube River, except Austria and the Ukraine, have ratified the CMNI until January 2011. The goal of this convention {{is to set up}} unified regulations for the carriage of goods <b>by</b> <b>inland</b> <b>waterways.</b> After a short introduction of some terms concerning inland navigation, the thesis gives a summary of the convention's content. After these theoretical chapters the thesis analyzes and evaluates the effect of the CMNI on the market situation of inland navigation companies which are operating in the Danube region. The results of the empirical analysis of 16 transportation companies, with place of business in the EU and operating on the Danube river, show that the CMNI is a convention with a more symbolic than practical or financial value. However, the CMNI has been past-due for decades. Thus the CMNI is seen as a seed towards a more unified law on carriage of goods <b>by</b> <b>inland</b> navigation. As a result of the researched findings, the thesis favors the ratification of the CMNI by Austria. Nevertheless, it is suggested that the convention can only be fruitful in combination with numerous measures, such as the modernization of harbors along the Danube, the elimination of nautical bottlenecks, an increase of subsidies and improved public relation work by the market participants.
