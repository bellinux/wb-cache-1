40|$|International audienceAlbic {{material}} {{is a widespread}} soil diagnostic <b>material.</b> The <b>genesis</b> of albic <b>materials</b> {{is known to be}} very sensitive to changes in environmental conditions resulting from natural or anthropic driving forces. Common agricultural practices like liming or drainage improvement are able to change the nature or the intensity of albic <b>material</b> <b>genesis.</b> The direction and the amplitude of such changes have however remained controversial {{because of a lack of}} quantitative approaches. In this paper, the intensity of the <b>genesis</b> of albic <b>material</b> was quantified in one forested Retisol and compared to those previously quantified in two limed and cropped soils sampled respectively far from and close to a drain line. Liming practices were found to decrease the intensity of the <b>genesis</b> of albic <b>material</b> by two thirds with reference to natural soil evolution under forest. Contrastingly, artificial drainage improvement initiated the development of physically-driven albic <b>material</b> <b>genesis</b> due to translocation of soil particles but without significant implication of any reduction process. The observed increase in the intensity of albic <b>material</b> <b>genesis</b> after artificial improvement was higher in the immediate vicinity of drains than was its decrease after liming applications. It was however the reverse for the rest of the soil between the drains. As a result, the overall effect of cultivation was a slowdown of the genesis of albic horizons by comparison to the natural evolution under forest. Such changes in both the nature and the intensity of albic <b>material</b> <b>genesis</b> clearly demonstrated that i) numerous genetic pathways may be simultaneously or successively active at a particular location, and ii) anthropic driving-forces like agricultural practices may be a way to favour one particular genetic pathway at the expense of another.

40|$|The Genesis Discovery mission {{returned}} solar {{matter in}} the form of the solar wind with the goal of obtaining precise solar isotopic abundances (for the first time) and greatly improved elemental abundances. Measurements of the light noble gases in regime samples demonstrate that isotopes are fractionated in the solar wind relative to the solar photosphere. Theory is required for correction. Measurement of the solar wind O and N isotopes shows that these are very different from any inner solar system materials. The solar O isotopic composition is consistent with photochemical self-shielding. For unknown reasons, the solar N isotopic composition is much lighter than essentially all other known solar system materials, except the atmosphere of Jupiter.

40|$|Shortly {{after the}} NASA Genesis Mission sample return capsule {{returned}} to earth on September 8, 2004, the science team discovered that all nine ultra-pure semiconductor materials were contaminated {{with a thin}} molecular organic film approximately 0 to 100 angstroms thick. The organic contaminate layer, possibly a silicone, situated {{on the surface of}} the materials is speculated to have formed by condensation of organic matter from spacecraft off-gassing at the Lagrange 1 halo orbit during times of solar exposure. While the valuable solar wind atoms are safely secured directly below this organic contamination and/or native oxide layer in approximately the first 1000 angstroms of the ultra-pure material substrate, some analytical techniques that precisely measure solar wind elemental abundances require the removal of this organic contaminate. In 2005, Genesis science team laboratories began to develop various methods for removing the organic thin film without removing the precious material substrate that contained the solar wind atoms. Stephen Sestak and colleagues at Open University first experimented with ultraviolet radiation ozone (UV/O 3) cleaning of several non-flight and flown Genesis silicon wafer fragments under a pure flowing oxygen environment. The UV/O 3 technique was able to successfully remove organic contamination without etching into the bulk material substrate. At NASA Johnson Space Center Genesis Curation Laboratory, we have installed an UV/O 3 cleaning devise in an ambient air environment to further experimentally test the removal of the organic contamination on <b>Genesis</b> wafer <b>materials.</b> Preliminary results from XPS analysis show that the UV/O 3 cleaning instrument is a good non-destructive method for removing carbon contamination from flown Genesis array samples. However, spectroscopic ellipsometry results show little change in the thickness of the surface film. All experiments to date have shown UV/O 3 cleaning method to be the best non-destructive method for removing organic contamination from the surface of the <b>Genesis</b> <b>materials.</b> The UV/O 3 cleaning process can also clean carbon contamination to levels below non-flight standards.

The {{intent was to}} deploy a drogue chute and parafoil high over the Utah desert and to catch the fragile payload capsule in mid-air by helicopter. The capsule would then be opened in a clean-room constructed for that purpose at UTTR, and a nitrogen purge was to be installed before transporting the science canister to JSC.

Yet the link between <b>material</b> <b>genesis,</b> microstructure, and mechanical performance for these materials is still an enigma that has deceived many decoding attempts. In this article, we advance statistical indentation analysis techniques that make it possible to assess, in situ, the nanomechanical properties, packing density distributions, and morphology of hydrated nanocomposites. These techniques are applied to identify intrinsic and structural sources of anisotropy of hydrated nanoparticles: calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H), apatite, and clay. It is shown that C–S–H and apatite, the binding phase in, respectively, cement-based materials and bone, are intrinsically isotropic; this is most probably due to a random precipitation and growth process of particles in calcium oversaturated pore solutions, which can also explain the nonnegligible internanoparticle friction. In contrast, the load-bearing clay phase in shale, the sealing formation of most hydrocarbon reservoirs, is found to be intrinsically anisotropic and frictionless. This is indicative of a ‘smooth' deposition and compaction history, which, in contrast to mineral growth in confined spaces, minimizes nanoparticle interlocking. In all cases, the nanomechanical behavior is governed by packing density distributions of elementary particles delimitating macroscopic diversity...|$|R

40|$|Huckenholz (1963) {{showed that}} the {{original}} arkose and graywacke overlap completely in both texture and composition; perhaps uppression ofone or both terms is indicated. Graywacke has the longer, if not more signif-icant (albeit confused), history. For 100 years in Germany and 50 in Britain, before development by Sorby of thin section petrography, graywacke {{was used as a}} purely hand specimen term based chiefly upon texture. It seems pointless to change this emphasis for an important, large, texturally-similar yet compositlonally-varied rock clan. Modal analysis and interpretation f immature sandstones presents many problems, especially that of matrix which is increasingly attacked as a classificatory parameter, chiefly of maturity. But it matters not how or when conspicuous matrix of graywackes formed for it to be useful for descriptive "coarse " separation ofpure (arenite) and impure (wacke) sandstones; <b>genesis</b> of fine <b>material</b> must be interpreted inany sand, recent or ancient. Finer subdivision can be made on a compositional basis following flexible schemes such as Gilbert's. Sedimentary struc-tures, tectonics, provenance, depositlonal process and environment should be avoided in petrographic classifica-tion. If textural and compositional maturity be accepted as the prime guides in classification, then purely quanti-tative placing of a rock within each maturity spectrum could replace all troublesome varietal names...|$|R
40|$|The inner {{structure}} of a material is called microstructure. It stores the <b>genesis</b> of a <b>material</b> and determines all its physical and chemical properties. While microstructural characterization is widely spread and well known, the microstructural classification is mostly done manually by human experts, which opens doors for huge uncertainties. Since the microstructure could {{be a combination of}} different phases with complex substructures its automatic classification is very challenging and just a little work in this field has been carried out. Prior related works apply mostly designed and engineered features by experts and classify microstructure separately from feature extraction step. Recently Deep Learning methods have shown surprisingly good performance in vision applications by learning the features from data together with the classification step. In this work, we propose a deep learning method for microstructure classification in the examples of certain microstructural constituents of low carbon steel. This novel method employs pixel-wise segmentation via Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNN) accompanied by max-voting scheme. Our system achieves 93. 94 % classification accuracy, drastically outperforming the state-of-the-art method of 48. 89 % accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of pixel-wise approaches. Beyond the success presented in this paper, this line of research offers a more robust and first of all objective way for the difficult task of steel quality appreciation...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate tissue reactions such as bone genesis, cartilage <b>genesis</b> and graft <b>materials</b> in the early phase of lumbar intertransverse process fusion in a rabbit model using computed tomography (CT) imaging with CT intensity (Hounsfield units) measurement, and to compare these data with histological results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lumbar intertransverse process fusion was performed on 18 rabbits. Four graft materials were used: autograft bone (n = 3); collagen membrane soaked with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2) (n = 5); granular calcium phosphate (n = 5); and granular calcium phosphate coated with rhBMP- 2 (n = 5). All rabbits were euthanized 3 weeks post-operatively and lumbar spines were removed for CT imaging and histological examination. RESULTS: Computed tomography imaging demonstrated that each fusion mass component had the appropriate CT intensity range. CT also showed the different distributions and intensities of bone genesis in the fusion masses between the groups. Each component of tissue reactions was identified successfully on CT images using the CT intensity difference. Using CT color mapping, these observations could be easily visualized, and the results correlated well with histological findings. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CT intensity is an effective approach for observing and comparing early tissue reactions such as newly synthesized bone, newly synthesized cartilage, and graft materials after lumbar intertransverse process fusion in a rabbit model...|$|R
