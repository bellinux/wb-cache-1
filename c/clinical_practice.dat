5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice.</b>|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} of research in integrated healthcare information systems is to enable decision support among clinicians across boundaries of organizations and regional workgroups. A necessary precursor, however, is to facilitate the construction of appropriate awareness of local <b>clinical</b> <b>practices,</b> including a clinician's actual cognitive capabilities, peculiar workplace circumstances, and specific patient-centered needs based on real-world clinical contexts across work settings. In this paper, a user-centered study aimed to investigate <b>clinical</b> <b>practices</b> across three different geographical areas-the U. K., the UAE and Nigeria-is presented. The findings indicate that differences in <b>clinical</b> <b>practices</b> among clinicians are associated with differences in local work contexts across work settings, but are moderated by adherence to best practice guidelines {{and the need for}} patient-centered care. The study further reveals that an awareness especially of the ontological, stereotypical, and situated practices plays a crucial role in adapting knowledge for cross-boundary decision support. The paper then outlines a set of design guidelines for the development of enterprise information systems for e-health. Based on the guidelines, the paper proposes the conceptual design of CaDHealth, a practice-centered framework for making sense of <b>clinical</b> <b>practices</b> across work settings for effective cross-boundary e-health decision support...|$|R
5|$|Gottesman did his {{graduate}} {{work at the}} University of Minnesota, which then patterned its clinical psychology program on the Boulder model, which emphasized research theory and <b>clinical</b> <b>practice.</b> He joined the graduate program in 1956 after three years with the Navy, supported by the Korean War G.I. Bill. He began investigating personality traits in identical and fraternal twins who had filled out the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). His Ph.D. thesis, submitted to Psychological Monographs, was rejected before a review {{on the grounds that}} the nature–nurture issue it addressed had already been settled in favor of nurture.

5|$|In 2011, the American College of Physicians (ACP) {{issued a}} <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> {{guideline}} making three strong recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence: that hospitalized patients be assessed for {{their risk of}} thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis is started; that heparin or a related drug be used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used. The ACP also drew attention {{to a lack of}} support for any performance measures encouraging physicians to apply universal prophylaxis without regard to the risks.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} no therapeutic approaches targeting CASS4, {{and in the}} absence of a catalytic domain and no extracellular moieties, it may be challenging to generate such an agent.
