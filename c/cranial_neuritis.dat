Gold standard diagnosis certainly requires isolation of organism from blood and make it as investigation of choice. Adequate and early treatment produces very good recovery without neurological deficit in majority of cases. Management requires supportive therapy along with combination of antibiotics including doxycycline, rifampicine, aminoglycosides, contrimoxazole for a period of 8 - 12 weeks.

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} {{neurological}} complications of chickenpox with prognosis. Background: The neurological complications occur in 0. 03 &#x 0025; {{of persons who}} get chickenpox. There is no universal vaccination against chicken pox in India. Most patients prefer alternate modalities of treatment. Hence these complications of chickenpox {{are likely to continue}} to occur. Study Design: A prospective study was conducted for 2 years (from March 2002) on the admitted cases with neurological complications after chickenpox (with rash or scar). Patients were investigated with CT/MRI, CSF study, EEG and nerve conduction studies and hematological workup. They were followed-up for 1 year and outcome assessed using modified Rankin scale. Results: The latency for the neurological complications was 4 - 32 days (mean: 16. 32 days). There were 18 cases: 10 adults (64 &#x 0025;) and 8 children (36 &#x 0025;). Cerebellar ataxia (normal CT/MRI) was observed in 7 cases (32 &#x 0025;) (mean age: 6. 85 years). One patient (6 years) had acute right hemiparesis in the fifth week due to left capsular infarct. All these cases spontaneously recovered by 4 weeks. The age range of the adult patients was 13 - 47 years (mean: 27 years). The manifestations included cerebellar and pyramidal signs (n- 4) with features of demyelination in MRI who recovered spontaneously or with methylprednisolone by 8 weeks. Patient with encephalitis recovered in 2 weeks with acyclovir. Guillain Barre syndrome of the demyelinating type (n- 2) was treated with Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and they had a slow recovery by a modified Rankin scale (mRs) score of 3 and 2 at 6 months and 1 year, respectively. One case died after hemorrhage into the occipital infarct. There were two cases of asymmetrical neuropathy, one each of the seventh <b>cranial</b> and brachial <b>neuritis.</b> Conclusion: Spontaneous recovery occurs in post-chickenpox cerebellar ataxia.

In the chronic stage, many months or years after the initial infection, other neurologic complications may occur, such as encephalomyelitis, epileptic crises, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy and psychiatric disturbances such as depression, anxiety, panick attacks, catatonia, psychosis etc. Some patient continue to experience symptoms of fatigue, insomnia or psychiatric disorder in the post borrelia syndrome. We describe here a patient with a triad of unusual symptoms in chronic LNB including tremor, seizures and psychosis. Standardized medical interview, neurologic examination, neuroimaging, serum and CSF serology as well as EEG and EMNG evaluation were performed. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and doxycycline and responded with rapid clinical and functional improvement. Newertheless, he suffered from multiple systemic and neurologic sequelas that influenced his daily activities in post treatment period. Emphasis is placed on the atypical onset and evolution, the difficulties encountered in formulating diagnosis, early treatment and the uncertainties concerning the sequelae after treatment.

Antibodiesto rOspA, rOspB, and r-flagellin were detected by immunoblot and ELISA using the recombinant proteins. Patients with late disease responded to rOspA, rOspB, and r-flagellin, or only to r-flagellin, whereas patients with early disease showed no response or responded only to r-flagellin, Patients who developedantibodies to r-flagellin also responded to 41 -G. The data suggestthat recombinantB. burgdorferi antigens can serveas substrates for immunoblot and ELISA, whichmaybe helpful in diagnosing Lyme disease. Lyme {{disease is a}} tickborne infection caused by the spiro-chete Borrelia burgdorferi. The illness typically evolves in stages, beginning with erythema migrans and progressing through a stage of dissemination during which secondary skin lesions, carditis, meningitis, <b>cranial</b> <b>neuritis,</b> and inter-mittent arthritis can occur to a chronic stage with peripheral neuritis and persistent arthritis [I]. The diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on clinical history and physical findings; how-ever, {{in the absence of}} erythema migrans, the diagnosis can be difficult and laboratory tests may be needed for confirma-tion. ELISAs and immunoblots using whole organisms to mea-sure serologic immune responses to B. burgdorferi antigens are the most widely used tests, but specificity and sensitivity have varied widely [2, 3]. False-positive results can occur due to the presence of rheumatoid factor or antibody to other spirochetes, including those causing syphilis and periodontal disease [4 - 6].

40|$|John J HalperinDepartment of Neurosciences, Overlook Medical Center, Summit, NJ, USAAbstract: Lyme disease, {{infection}} with the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, causes both specific and nonspecific symptoms. In untreated chronic infection, specific manifestations {{such as a}} relapsing large-joint oligoarthritis can persist for years, yet subside with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Nervous system involvement occurs in 10 %â€“ 15 % of untreated patients and typically involves lymphocytic meningitis, <b>cranial</b> <b>neuritis,</b> and/or mononeuritis multiplex; in some rare cases, patients have parenchymal inflammation in the brain or spinal cord. Nervous system infection is similarly highly responsive to antimicrobial therapy, including oral doxycycline. Nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, perceived cognitive slowing, headache, and others occur in patients with Lyme disease and are indistinguishable from comparable symptoms occurring in innumerable other inflammatory states. There {{is no evidence that}} these nonspecific symptoms reflect nervous system infection or damage, or that they are in any way specific to or diagnostic of this or other tick-borne infections. When these symptoms occur in patients with Lyme disease, they typically also subside after antimicrobial treatment, although this may take time. Chronic fatigue states have been reported to occur following any number of infections, including Lyme disease. The mechanism underlying this association is unclear, although there is no evidence in any of these infections that these chronic posttreatment symptoms are attributable to ongoing {{infection with}} B. burgdorferi or any other identified organism. Available appropriately controlled studies indicate that additional or prolonged courses of antimicrobial therapy do not benefit patients with a chronic fatigue-like state after appropriately treated Lyme disease.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo review {{our current}} {{knowledge}} of the etiopathogenesis of Bell's palsy, including viral infection or autoimmunity, and to discuss disease pathogenesis with respect to pharmacotherapy. Systematic review methodologyRelevant publications on the etiopathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis and histopathology of Bell's palsy from 1975 to 2012 were analysed. Results and conclusionsBell's palsy is an idiopathic peripheral nerve palsy involving the facial nerve. It accounts for 60 to 75 % of all cases of unilateral facial paralysis. The annual incidence of Bell's palsy is 15 to 30 per 100, 000 people. The peak incidence occurs between the second and fourth decades (15 to 45 years). The aetiology of Bell's palsy is unknown but viral infection or autoimmune disease has been postulated as possible pathomechanisms. Bell's palsy may be caused when latent herpes viruses (herpes simplex, herpes zoster) are reactivated from cranial nerve ganglia. A cell-mediated autoimmune mechanism against a myelin basic protein has been suggested for the pathogenesis of Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy may be an autoimmune demyelinating <b>cranial</b> <b>neuritis,</b> and in most cases, it is a mononeuritic variant of Guillainâ€“BarrÃ© syndrome, a neurologic disorder with recognised cell-mediated immunity against peripheral nerve myelin antigens. In Bell's palsy and GBS, a viral infection or the reactivation of a latent virus may provoke an autoimmune reaction against peripheral nerve myelin components, leading to the demyelination of cranial nerves, especially the facial nerve. Given the safety profile of acyclovir, valacyclovir, and short-course oral corticosteroids, patients who present within three days of the onset of symptoms should be offered combination therapy. However it seems logical that in fact, steroids exert their beneficial effect via immunosuppressive action, {{as is the case}} in some other autoimmune disorders. It is to be hoped that (monoclonal) antibodies and/or T-cell immunotherapy might provide more specific treatment guidelines in the management of Bell's palsy...|$|E
40|$|The {{submitted}} work {{attempts to}} map the wide spectrum of the specific proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the context with biochemical and cytological parameters in different clinical forms of neuroborreliosis. Goals of the study: 1) Evaluation of the CSF parameters of patients with neuroborreliosis; 2) Try to define the model of CSF parameters typical for neuroborreliosis; 3) To determine differences between the early and late form of borrelial infection. Further to define possible specific CSF changes in the patients with neuroborreliosis especially {{in comparison with the}} CSF parameters common in MS that comes often into consideration in the differential diagnosis of the late borrelial impairment of CNS. Similarly to define the specific finding of the borrelial infection of PNS in comparison to the non-borrelial ones. Then to emphasize the typical inflammatory CSF picture of the borrelial <b>cranial</b> <b>neuritis</b> as well; 4) To determine the occasional clinical-laboratory correlations or general observation about the processes in the compartments of CSF-CNS. The clinical aspect consists in the introduction of new diagnostic methods and especially their complex evaluation in the frame of the neurological differential diagnostic of serous inflammations of CNS. The complex of the inflammatory parameters of the CSF can also help in deciding about the activity of inflammation in unclear seropositive cases in the population with a high prevalence of the anamnestic antiborrelial antibodies. That is the problem of the Czech Republic. The scientific aspect lies in the definition of new general observations about the inflammatory processes in CNS, because the relations of biochemical, immunological and cytological parameters of CSF in neuroborreliosis have not been investigated yet in details in this form and extension.

40|$|Lyme borreliosis is a tick-transmitted multisystem {{infection}} {{caused by}} Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The spiro-chetes migrate early after the skin inoculation to various organ systems. The central and peripheral nervous sys-tem is frequently affected, and 10 - 20 % of untreated cases develop neurological symptoms (neuroborreliosis), often with radiculoneuropathy, lymphocytic meningitis, and <b>cranial</b> <b>neuritis,</b> particularly facial nerve palsy. Another less common clinical pattern is focal or disseminated encephalomyelitis. Postinfectious sequelae {{are reported to}} occur in about 25 % of the patients. To characterise the pattern of damage, biochemical markers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) were analysed before and after treatment. The astroglial protein markers glia fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) and S- 100 protein, and the neuronal markers neurofilament protein (light subunit) (NFL) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), were quantified. The results indicate an astroglial reaction in early and late stages of LNB but no signs of glial tissue destruction. Both NFL and NSE levels were increased in CSF before treatment, reflecting axonal damage and neuronal tissue involvement. Increased pretreatment concentrations of CSF-GFAp and CSF-NFL were correlated to an unfavourable clinical outcome, and CSF-NFL was increased in patients with longer duration of neurological symptoms before treatment, reflecting progressive tissue injury. The myelin-associated glycolipid sulphatide {{was found to be}} increased in CSF of 90 % of patients with LNB before compared with after treatment, but the levels were not correlated to clinical patterns or outcome. Antig-lycolipid antibodies have earlier been associated with the pathogenesis of various autoimmune processes with neuropathy, and the serum antisulphatide reaction was therefore analysed in patients with LNB. Serum IgG anti-sulphatide antibodies were found in 65 % of the LNB patients, indicating infection-triggered autoimmune reac-tions in LNB. Antibiotic treatment of LNB is efficient, but current treatment regimens often recommend intravenous administration. To evaluate doxycycline therapy by the oral route, we studied 29 patients with LNB-associated facial palsy and meningitis in a prospective non-randomised treatment study. Oral doxycycline was given for a mean of 10. 8 days. Twenty-six patients (90 %) recovered without sequelae within six months. CSF showed a marked decrease of inflammatory cells and protein levels post-treatment in all patients. The favourable outcome agrees with fin-dings of reports on intravenous antibiotic treatment for LNB. In a pharmacokinetic study of doxycycline in pati-ents with suspected LNB, the CSF concentrations of doxycycline were found to exceed 0. 6 mg/L (estimated mean of MIC for B. burgdorferi) in 3 out of 12 patients treated with 200 mg daily and in 9 out of 10 patients given 400 mg daily...|$|E
40|$|Die Neuroborreliose ist eine hÃ¤ufige Manifestion der durch Zecken Ã¼bertragende Lyme Borreliose. In der Literatur wird mehrfach angedeutet, dass sich das Krankheitsbild der Neuroborreliose jedoch in Europa von dem in den USA unterscheidet. Bisher konnte aber nicht bewiesen werden, ob sich diese Unterschiede auf die variierenden Falldefinitionen grÃ¼ndet oder mÃ¶glicherweise unterschiedliche Subspezies der Borrelia burgdorferi in Europa und den USA verantwortlich sind. In dieser Studie haben wir drei Kohorten verglichen, eine in Deutschland mit 273 Patienten, eine in Schweden mit 124 und eine in den USA mit 62 Patienten. Alle Patienten (> 15 Jahre) wurden retrospektiv an KrankenhÃ¤user mit einer langen Tradition der Borrelienforschung rekrutiert. Die Rekrutierung erfolgte nach drei Falldefinition, die bereits in vielen anderen europÃ¤ischen und amerikanischen Studien angewendet wurden, davon musste {{mindestens}} eine Definition erfÃ¼llt werden. Die Verteilung in die Krankheitstadien der Neuroborreliose stellte sich in allen drei LÃ¤ndern gleich dar (Stadium II 94 - 98 %, Stadium III 2 - 6 %). In den beiden europÃ¤ischen Kohorten war das Syndrom der Meningoradikulitis das fÃ¼hrende Syndrom (73 - 75 %). Die Krankheitssymptome der Neuroborreliose entwickelten meistens in einer typischen Reihenfolge. FÃ¤lle von akuter und chronischer Mono/Polyneuritis ohne Beteiligung der Meninigen und des ZNS traten in nur 5 - 10 % auf. Im Gegensatz dazu litten ein Drittel der amerikanischen Patienten an einer Mono/Polyneuritis und 50 % dieser Patienten hatten eine craniale Neuritis ohne ZNS-Beteiligung. Eine Meningoradikulitis bekamen 42 % der Patienten, auch hier die grÃ¶ÃŸte Gruppe, doch die Symptome wie radikulÃ¤re Schmerzen, SensibilitÃ¤tsstÃ¶rungen und Paresen traten sehr viel spÃ¤ter auf und der Liquor zeigte eine geringere ZellzahlerhÃ¶hung bei diesen Patienten. Jedoch akute ZNS-Manifestationen wie eine Meningoenzephalitis und Meningomyelitis trat in allen drei LÃ¤ndern gleich hÃ¤ufig auf (ca. 13 %). Aber die chronischen Formen wie ein progressive Meningoenzephalomyelitis oder die Cerebrovaskulitis konnten in den USA nie diagnostiziert werden. Extraneurologische Manifestationen wie eine Dermatoborreliose oder erhÃ¶hte Leberwerte fanden sich ebenfalls in allen drei LÃ¤ndern gleich hÃ¤ufig, eine zusÃ¤tzliche Arthritis als auch eine Carditis war bei den amerikanischen Patienten hÃ¤ufiger (15 % und 3 %) im Vergleich zu den europÃ¤ischen Patienten (2 % und 1 %). Somit konnten unterschiedliche klinische Syndrome der Neuroborreliose gefunden werden in Deutschland und Schweden im Vergleich zu den USA. Einige Syndrome variieren deutlich in der Frequenz, wÃ¤hrend andere sich in ihrer Phenomenologie auch sehr Ã¤hneln. Diese Ergebnise sind wichtig fÃ¼r weitere epidemiologische und therapeutische Studien der Neuroborreliose und sollten dort beachtet werden. Objective: Neuroborrliosis (NB) is {{a frequent}} manifestation of the tick transmitted spirochetosis Lyme borreliosis. According to the literature the pattern of disease in Europe and the USA appear to be different. Until yet {{it is unclear whether}} this is due to varying case definitions or probably strain variations between Europe and America. Patients and methods: So we have compared three cohorts of patients, one in Germany (n= 273), in Sweden (n= 124) and in the USA (n= 62). All patients (> 15 years) were enrolled to the study retrospectively at hospitals which serve {{a large proportion of the}} population in areas with a high reported incidence of Lyme disease. Only patients were eligible for the study who fulfilled at least one of three predefined multivariable case definitions we already used in a different study about stages and syndromes of neuroborreliosis. Results: The stage distribution was comparable in all three countries (stage II: 94 - 98 %; stage III: 2 - 6 %). In the two European cohorts meningoradiculits (73 - 75 %) was the leading syndrome. Symptoms and signs of neuroborreliosis developed usually in a characteristic sequence. Cases of acute or chronic mono/polyneuritis without involving the meninx and other parts of the CNS occurred in just 5 - 10 %. In contrast, American patients suffered from a mono/polyneuritis in about one third and 50 % of these patients complained about a <b>cranial</b> <b>neuritis</b> without CSF changes. A meningoradiculitis developed in 42 %, also the largest group of the cohort, but it took significantly longer till the patients developed radicular pain and then a sensible deficit and/or a paresis and the CSF showed a less higher cell count in American than European patients with this syndrome. However, if acute CNS-manifestations (ca. 13 %) as an encephalitis or myelitis occurred no differences could be shown between American and European patients. In the USA no cases of chronic progressive encephalomyelitis or a cerebrovasculitis were observed. Extraneurological findings as dermatoborreliosis and elevated hepatic enzymes were represented frequently in America and Europe. An additional arthritis or carditis were observed more often in our American cohort (15 %; 3 %) than in the European cohorts (2 %; 1 %). Conclusion: Different clinical syndromes are found in patients with neuroborreliosis from Germany and Sweden, compared with patients in the USA. Some syndromes vary strikingly in the frequency, while others are remarkably similar in phenomenology and frequency. This finding is important to consider when epidemiological and antibiotic treatment studies of neuroborreliosis are compared and when virulence properties of Borrelia burgdorferi subspecies are discussed...|$|E

O ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) para Borrelia burgdorferi foi positivo em 21 (30 %) pacientes do grupo da SBY e apenas em 3 dos 50 (6 %) indivÃ­duos do grupo controle (p = 0. 01). Usando o mÃ©todo de Western {{blotting}} (WB) modificado para antÃ­genos da B. burgdorferi, trinta e cinco (50 %) dos pacientes com SBY foram positivos, e 2 (4 %) indivÃ­duos do grupo controle. (p 0, 001). A ReaÃ§Ã£o de ImunofluorescÃªncia Indireta (RIFI) (IgG) apresentou resultados significativos para trÃªs das cinco espÃ©cies de Rickettsia spp analisadas: R. parkeri (8, 6 %) (p = 0, 032), R. amblyommii (22. 8 %) (p = 0, 031) e para R. bellii (8. 6 %) (p = 0, 032). O Teste do Qui-quadrado foi usado para anÃ¡lise estatÃ­stica.. Poucos pacientes apresentaram positividade para antÃ­genos de B. bovis (RIFI e ELISA) e B. equi (RIFI). A RIFI para antÃ­genos da Ehrlichia canis foi positiva apenas para um (1. 4 %) paciente com SBY. Isto nos leva a concluir que pacientes com SBY apresentaram co-infecÃ§Ã£o com R. parkeri, R [...] amblyommi e R. belli, sugerindo que a SBY possa ser transmitida pelos mesmos carrapatos responsÃ¡veis pela transmissÃ£o destas Rickettsias. Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis, Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis, Babesiosis, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Lyme Disease (LD) are tick-borne diseases {{commonly found}} in the North hemisphere. In Brazil, a LD-like illness called Baggio- Yoshinari Syndrome (BYS) is described, but epidemiological, clinical and laboratorial features {{are different from the}} original LD. In Brazilian humans, the other tick-borne diseases are less frequently studied. The aim of this survey was to verify the possibility of co-infections between BYS and other tick-borne diseases, using laboratorial assays to Ehrlichia spp, Babesia spp and Rickettsia spp in a group of 70 patients with BYS. Ten patients were at initial stage of the disease and 60 patients were in a latent stage. Erythema migrans (EM) was present in 27 patients (38. 6 %), arthritis in 26 (37, 1 %), fever in 13 (18. 5 %), headache in 29 (41. 4 %) arthralgia in 36 (51. 4 %), myalgia in 51 (72, 8 %), fatigue in 38 (54, 3 %), meningitis in 4 (5. 7 %), <b>cranial</b> <b>neuritis</b> in 8 (11. 4 %), peripheral radiculopathy in 9 (12. 8 %), encephalomyelitis in 4 (5. 7 %), cardiopathy in 7 (10 %), atypical skin eruptions in 10 (14. 3 %) and anemia in 10 patients (14. 3 %). ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunossorbent Assay) for Borrelia burgdorferi antigens was positive in 21 patients (30 %) of BYS group, while only 3 (6 %) from 50 normal individuals had positive reactions (p = 0. 01). Using the modified Western Blotting (WB) method for B. burgdorferi antigens, 35 (50 %) of the BYS patients were positive, and 2 normal individuals (4 %) from the control group (p 0, 001). Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) (IgG) presented positive results for three of five species of Rickettsia tested: R. parkeri (8, 6 %) (p = 0, 032), R. amblyommii (22. 8 %) (p = 0, 031) and for R. bellii (8. 6 %) (p = 0, 032). Chi-square test was used for the statistic analysis. A few patients developed a positive reaction to B. bovis (IFA and ELISA) and B. equi antigens (IFA). IFA for Ehrlichia canis antigens was positive in only one patient (1. 4 %) with BYS. It was possible to conclude that BYS patients presented a coinfection with R. parkeri, R. amblyommi and R. bellii, suggesting that BYS can be vectored by the same ticks responsible for the transmission of Rickettsial agents...|$|E
