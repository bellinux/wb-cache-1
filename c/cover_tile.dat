2500|$|Ancient Greek {{buildings}} of timber, clay and plaster construction were probably roofed with thatch. With {{the rise of}} stone architecture came the appearance of fired ceramic roof tiles. These early roof tiles showed an S-shape, with the pan and <b>cover</b> <b>tile</b> forming one piece. They were much larger than modern roof tiles, being up to [...] long, [...] wide, [...] thick and weighing around [...] apiece.

50|$|In {{modern times}} this style is {{popular in the}} American {{southwest}} where it is called Pan and Cover or Mission Style. An easier-to-install variant called S-Tile is essentially the synthesis of a pan tile and a <b>cover</b> <b>tile.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{projection}} tessellates the plane; i.e., repeated copies can completely <b>cover</b> (<b>tile)</b> {{an arbitrary}} area, each copy's features exactly matching {{those of its}} neighbors.(See the example to the right).Furthermore, the four triangles of the second hemisphere of Peirce quincuncial projection can be rearranged as another square that is placed next to the square that corresponds to the first hemisphere, resulting in a rectangle with aspect ratio of 2:1; this arrangement {{is equivalent to the}} transverse aspect of the Guyou hemisphere-in-a-square projection.|$|E

50|$|Ancient Greek {{buildings}} of timber, clay and plaster construction were probably roofed with thatch. With {{the rise of}} stone architecture came the appearance of fired ceramic roof tiles. These early roof tiles showed an S-shape, with the pan and <b>cover</b> <b>tile</b> forming one piece. They were much larger than modern roof tiles, being up to 90 cm long, 70 cm wide, 3 - 4 cm thick and weighing around 30 kg apiece. Only stone walls, which were replacing the earlier mudbrick and wood walls, were strong enough to support {{the weight of a}} tiled roof.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} finds of {{roof tiles}} in archaic Greece are documented {{from a very}} restricted area around Corinth, where fired tiles began to replace thatched roofs at two temples of Apollo and Poseidon between 700 and 650 BC. Spreading rapidly, roof tiles were within fifty years in evidence for {{a large number of}} sites around the Eastern Mediterranean, including Mainland Greece, Western Asia Minor, and Southern and Central Italy. Early roof tiles showed an S-shape, with the pan and <b>cover</b> <b>tile</b> forming one piece. They were rather bulky affairs, weighing around 30 kg apiece. Being more expensive and labour-intensive to produce than thatch, their introduction has been explained by their greatly enhanced fire resistance, which gave desired protection to the costly temples.|$|E

30|$|In {{parallel}} to the LCH AIS experiment, a microcosm batch experiment with four LCH concentrations and a control was performed under laboratory conditions in 2  L glass beakers. Aufwuchs <b>covered</b> <b>tiles</b> {{were taken from the}} AIS during pre-application period (d−[*] 8). Grazers were from the same sampling as for the AIS experiment. In {{the first phase of the}} experiment, 8 aufwuchs <b>covered</b> <b>tiles</b> per treatment were placed in glass tanks (35.5 [*]×[*] 23 [*]×[*] 25.5  cm) with 3  L of modified Borgmann media. The respective LCH stock solutions were added into the tanks, and equal distribution of the substance was reached by aeration with Pasteur pipette (glass) and an air pump. The tiles remained in the tanks for 24  h to allow LCH to bind to the aufwuchs. Afterwards, the tiles were slightly dipped in unpolluted modified Borgmann media for washing and always two tiles were transferred into a glass beaker filled with 1  L of unpolluted modified Borgmann media. The beakers were placed in a water bath with a cooling unit (Compatible Control, Huber, Germany) and were aerated with Pasteur pipettes and an air pump. The exposure phase started with the introduction of 4 grazers into each beaker and was terminated after 28  days. Basic physicochemical parameters were measured weekly as in the AIS experiment. Grazer and aufwuchs analysis was performed at the end of the experiment.|$|R
