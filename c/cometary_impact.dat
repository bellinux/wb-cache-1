5|$|In 1802, {{shortly after}} {{discovering}} Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments {{of a much}} larger planet that once occupied the Mars–Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a <b>cometary</b> <b>impact</b> many million years before. Over time, however, this hypothesis has fallen from favor. The large amount of energy required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of the Moon, do not support the hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet. Today, most scientists accept that, rather than fragmenting from a progenitor planet, the asteroids never formed a planet at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuous}} {{shadows in}} the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100K. For Shackleton, the average temperature {{was determined to be}} about 90K, reaching 88K at the crater floor. Under these conditions, the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10−26 to 10−27m/s. Any water vapor that arrives here following a <b>cometary</b> <b>impact</b> on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface. However, the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far-side, suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice.|$|E
2500|$|A briefly popular theory {{held that}} a 12C-rich comet struck the earth and {{initiated}} the warming event. A <b>cometary</b> <b>impact</b> coincident with the P/E boundary can also help explain some enigmatic features associated with this event, such as the iridium anomaly at Zumaia, the abrupt appearance of kaolinitic clays with abundant magnetic nanoparticles on the coastal shelf of New Jersey, and especially the nearly simultaneous onset of the carbon isotope excursion and the thermal maximum. Indeed, a key feature and testable prediction of a comet impact is that it should produce virtually instantaneous environmental effects in the atmosphere and surface ocean with later repercussions in the deeper ocean. Even allowing for feedback processes, this would require at least 100 gigatons of extraterrestrial carbon. Such a catastrophic impact should have left its mark on the globe. Unfortunately, the evidence put forward does not stand up to scrutiny. An unusual 9-meter-thick clay layer supposedly formed soon after the impact, containing unusual amounts of magnetite, but it formed too slowly for these magnetic particles {{to have been a}} result of the comet's impact. and it turns out they were created by bacteria. [...] However, recent analyses have shown that isolated particles of non-biogenic origin make up the majority of the magnetic particles in the thick clay unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of deuterium in comet Hale–Bopp {{in the form}} of heavy water was found to be about twice that of Earth's oceans. If Hale–Bopp's deuterium abundance is typical of all comets, this implies that although <b>cometary</b> <b>impacts</b> are thought to be the source of a significant amount of the water on Earth, they cannot be the only source.|$|R
50|$|The central {{feature of}} Reiner Gamma resembles the dipolar {{formation}} created by iron filings on a {{surface with a}} bar magnet on the underside. Low-orbiting spacecraft have observed a relatively strong magnetic field associated with each of these albedo markings. Some have speculated that this magnetic field and the patterns were created by <b>cometary</b> <b>impacts.</b> However the true cause remains uncertain.|$|R
2500|$|Gould sees supreme {{irony in}} the recent {{hypothesis}} of the Berkeley scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez that mass extinctions were caused by asteroidal or <b>cometary</b> <b>impacts</b> (a hypothesis now made plausible by {{the discovery of a}} worldwide iridium layer deposited at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary); for this is precisely the sort of wild [...] "cosmological" [...] speculation that Lyell derided in seventeenth-century writers like William Whiston.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Society censured Halley for {{suggesting}} in 1694 {{that the}} story of Noah's flood might be an account of a <b>cometary</b> <b>impact.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>cometary</b> <b>impact</b> model {{argues that}} the high albedo of the swirls {{is the result of}} {{scouring}} of the top-most surface regolith by the coma’s turbulent flow of gas and dust, which exposed fresh material and redeposited the fine, scoured material in discrete deposits. According to this model, the associated strong magnetic anomalies are the result of magnetization of near-surface materials heated above the Curie temperature through hyper-velocity gas collisions and micro-impacts as the coma impacts the surface. Proponents of the <b>cometary</b> <b>impact</b> model consider the occurrence of many swirls antipodal to relatively young, major basins to be coincidental or the result of incomplete mapping of swirl locations.|$|E
50|$|The authors {{suggest that}} {{chambers}} (souterrains) found in Britain {{might have been}} attempts to build shelters to be sealed against tsunamis {{that would have been}} caused by a <b>cometary</b> <b>impact</b> in the sea. Current archaeological thought dates souterrains as late Iron Age, thousands of years after the supposed impact event.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, excessive amounts of radiation, gravitational perturbations {{and various other}} events have been proposed to affect the distribution of life within the galaxy. These include, controversially, such proposals as [...] "galactic tides" [...] {{with the potential to}} induce <b>cometary</b> <b>impacts</b> or even cold bodies of dark matter that pass through organisms and induce genetic mutations. However, the impact of many of these events may be difficult to quantify.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation is}} that <b>cometary</b> <b>impacts</b> release more energy on Callisto and Ganymede than they do at Titan due to the higher gravitational field of Jupiter. That could erode the atmospheres of Callisto and Ganymede, whereas the cometary material would actually build Titan's atmosphere. However, the 2H–1H (i.e. D–H) ratio of Titan's atmosphere is , nearly 1.5 times {{lower than that of}} comets. The difference suggests that cometary material is unlikely to be the major contributor to Titan's atmosphere.|$|R
500|$|The {{impact of}} SL9 {{highlighted}} Jupiter's {{role as a}} [...] "cosmic vacuum cleaner" [...] (or in deference to the ancients' planetary correspondences to the major organs in the human body, a [...] "cosmic liver") for the inner Solar System. The planet's strong gravitational influence leads to many small comets and asteroids colliding with the planet, {{and the rate of}} <b>cometary</b> <b>impacts</b> on Jupiter is thought to be between 2000-8000 times higher than the rate on Earth.|$|R
50|$|During this time, both Earth-bound {{scientists}} and the Belters notice that the innermost moons of Jupiter have mysteriously realigned, altering the trajectory of a once unimportant comet and setting in motion a direct collision with Earth. This is courtesy of the stuffily bureaucratic blimps—intelligent extraterrestrials living in the turbulence of Jupiter's upper atmosphere whose advanced gravity technology allows them to alter the orbital plane of the planet's moons and thereby avoid the type of <b>cometary</b> <b>impact</b> which, obliquely, precipitated their exodus from an unknown 'Firsthome' to Jupiter itself.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cometary</b> <b>impact</b> {{hypothesis}} {{of the origin}} of the bays was popular among earth scientists of the 1940s and 50s. After considerable debate and research, geologists determined the depressions were both too shallow and lacking in any evidence for them to be impact features. Reports of magnetic anomalies turned out not to show consistency across the sites. There were no meteorite fragments, shatter cones or planar deformation features. None of the necessary evidence for hypervelocity impacts was found. The conclusion was to reject the hypothesis that the Carolina Bays were created by impacts of asteroids or comets (Rajmon 2009).|$|E
50|$|The {{surface of}} this mare {{displays}} some swirling, higher albedo deposits {{that are similar}} to the Reiner Gamma feature on the Oceanus Procellarum. This feature is associated with a relatively strong magnetic field. It is also located at the antipode of the Mare Orientale impact basin, and may be associated with the formation of that feature. Other possible explanations for the formation include a <b>cometary</b> <b>impact,</b> venting of volcanic gases, or just normal surface markings that are shielded from space weathering due to the magnetic field. But the exact cause of albedo features such as this remain a mystery for future solution.|$|E

5|$|Methane {{can exist}} in the Martian {{atmosphere}} for only a limited period before it is destroyed—estimates of its lifetime range from 0.6–4 years. Its presence despite this short lifetime indicates that an active source of the gas must be present. Volcanic activity, <b>cometary</b> <b>impacts,</b> {{and the presence of}} methanogenic microbial life forms are among possible sources. Methane could be produced by a non-biological process called serpentinization involving water, carbon dioxide, and the mineral olivine, which is known to be common on Mars.|$|R
50|$|Several other craters {{also appear}} to have been formed about the time of the K-Pg boundary. This {{suggests}} the possibility of nearly simultaneous multiple impacts, perhaps from a fragmented asteroidal object, similar to the Shoemaker-Levy 9 <b>cometary</b> <b>impact</b> with Jupiter. Among these are the Boltysh crater, a 24-km (15-mi) diameter impact crater in Ukraine (65.17 ± 0.64 Ma); and the Silverpit crater, a 20-km (12-mi) diameter impact crater in the North Sea (60-65 Ma). Any other craters that might have formed in the Tethys Ocean would have been obscured by erosion and tectonic events such as the relentless northward drift of Africa and India.|$|E

5000|$|An opaque black [...] "spin {{membrane}}" [...] {{has been}} placed around Earth.

The membrane is permeable to spacecraft, and it protects Earth from {{the harmful effects of}} concentrated stellar radiation and <b>cometary</b> <b>impact.</b> A simulated sun {{on the inside of the}} membrane allows for a largely normal life cycle to continue. However, the passage of time outside the membrane means that all life on earth will end in a few decades when the sun's expansion makes that region of the solar system uninhabitable.|$|E
50|$|Shkadov thrusters, {{with the}} ability to change the orbital paths of stars in order to avoid various dangers to life such as cold {{molecular}} clouds or <b>cometary</b> <b>impacts,</b> would also be detectable in a similar fashion to the transiting extrasolar planets searched by Kepler. Unlike planets, though, the thrusters would appear to abruptly stop over the surface of a star rather than crossing it completely, revealing their technological origin. In addition, evidence of targeted extrasolar asteroid mining may also reveal extraterrestrial intelligence.|$|R
500|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that large asteroid and <b>cometary</b> <b>impacts</b> on Earth's surface {{may have caused}} fragments of microbe-laden rock to escape Earth's gravity, suggesting the possibility of transpermia.

30|$|The {{scale of}} vapor plumes in LPV {{experiments}} is ~ 10 − 3 – 10 − 4 m while that of asteroidal and <b>cometary</b> <b>impacts</b> on surfaces of planets is typically up to 106 m.

50|$|This crater {{became of}} {{interest}} to scientists when the Lunar Prospector detected unusually high concentrations of hydrogen {{on the floor of}} this and other nearby craters using a neutron spectrometer. The floor of this crater is kept in permanent shadow from the Sun, and thus maintains a temperature below 100 K. Thus the floor forms a cold trap, and any molecules of water that wander into the crater from <b>cometary</b> <b>impacts</b> can deposit on the floor and remain there almost permanently. The instruments on board Lunar Prospector gave a concentration of about 146 ppm of hydrogen, compared to 50 ppm for the average lunar surface.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{assume that}} if the sun has a companion, it has a period of 27 Myr {{corresponding}} to the periodicity seen in <b>cometary</b> <b>impacts</b> on earth.

From this we calculate the mass – distance relation for the companion. We then compute the expected apparent magnitude (visible and J band) for the companion using the models of Burrows (1993).
