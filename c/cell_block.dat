5|$|The {{single storey}} 1855 {{refractory}} block {{is on the}} same axis as the main <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> to its east. It consists of twelve punishment cells and six dark cells with no light. The gallows chamber, built in 1888, is between this and the main <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> and relates to the colonial use of the prison. The gallows operated via a rope tied around a beam, over a trap door, on the upper level. Opening the trap door would cause the condemned prisoner fall, and thus be hanged.|$|E

Some reviewers compared {{the film to}} other well-received prison dramas, including: Birdman of Alcatraz, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Cool Hand Luke, and Riot in <b>Cell</b> <b>Block</b> 11. Gene Siskel said that like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Shawshank Redemption is an inspirational drama about overcoming overbearing authority.|$|E

5|$|The Main <b>Cell</b> <b>Block</b> {{was built}} in two stages. Construction of the {{southern}} half of the block began in 1853 {{and most of the}} masonry works were finished within a year. The section was finished in 1855, including the association wards, a circular jarrah stairwell, and 18 solitary confinement cells in the Refractory Block. However, iron fittings for the guardrails, which had been ordered from England three years previously, still had not arrived. Anxious for the new <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> to start being used, Henderson ordered that doors and rails be made locally, with iron salvaged from convict transport ships. The obvious transition between the local and imported railing now marks the boundary between the southern and northern wings. Prisoners were transferred from the temporary South Beach prison on 1 June 1855.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Fremantle Prison, a former Australian prison in Fremantle, Western Australia, extends from its {{construction}} as a prison for convicts, using convict labour, in the 1850s, through to its modern-day usage {{as a tourist}} attraction. The design for Fremantle Prison {{was based on the}} Pentonville Prison in Britain, and it would be the longest, tallest prison <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> in the southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1851, and was completed by the end of 1859. The prison was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally sentenced prisoners. Following a Royal Commission held in 1898−99, some changes were made to Fremantle Prison, including knocking down the inner wall between two cells, introducing a prisoner classification system, and constructing internal walls in the main block to create four separate divisions. A new <b>cell</b> <b>block,</b> New Division, was completed in 1907 and occupied in 1908.|$|E
5|$|Work {{was also}} {{completed}} on the tunnels during 2005/06, {{and the main}} <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> was restored with an eighteen month, $1.9 million project in 2006 and 2007. The gallows room was restored in 2013 to conditions {{at the time of}} the last execution, in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Built between 1857 and 1859, the {{hospital}} was a crucial component of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the convict era relied on convict labour, which could only be provided if the convicts were healthy. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main <b>cell</b> <b>block,</b> with the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The Main <b>Cell</b> <b>Block</b> is {{the longest}} and tallest cell range in Australia, and a {{dominating}} feature of the prison. New Division, constructed between 1904 and 1907, continues the façade alignment of the main block. Service buildings were converted into the separate Women's Prison. Fremantle Prison is surrounded by limestone perimeter walls, while a two storey limestone gatehouse, with a central clock, presents an imposing entrance. North {{and south of the}} gatehouse, on The Terrace, are several cottages and houses – three of which are built in Victorian style in contrast to the Georgian style of the others.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} Fremantle Prison {{was based on}} the Pentonville Prison in Britain, but with {{diagonal}} cell blocks replaced with a four-storey linear structure, which would be the longest, tallest prison <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> in the southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1851, and work rapidly progressed following the arrival of the Royal Engineers later that year. They trained convicts to work with limestone, which was quarried on-site. The first priority was the construction of accommodation for Henderson and the prison warders, to relieve the expense of paying for private lodging.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{inmates were}} housed in cells {{that could only}} be {{accessed}} by entering through a small exercise yard attached {{to the back of the}} prison; only a small portal, just large enough to pass meals, opened onto the <b>cell</b> <b>blocks.</b> This design proved impractical, and in the middle of construction, cells were constructed that allowed prisoners to enter and leave the <b>cell</b> <b>blocks</b> through metal doors that were covered by a heavy wooden door to filter out noise. The halls were designed to have the feel of a church.|$|R
40|$|Industrial forming {{processes}} usually involve complex strain paths, {{which are}} {{typically associated with}} softening/hardening effects. These can mainly be ascribed {{to the development of}} an 'intragranular microstructure' consisting of dislocation <b>cells</b> and <b>cell</b> <b>blocks.</b> This paper addresses a method to incorporate these microstructural details at the grain-scale in a full-constraints Taylor model. The dislocation <b>cells</b> and <b>cell</b> <b>blocks</b> have a significant influence on the anisotropic properties of the material, particularly the r-values. The trends arising from the simulations correspond well with experimental observations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The prison {{walls were}} {{constructed}} beginning in 1853, {{and the site}} for the Main <b>Cell</b> <b>Block</b> was excavated and levelled. Once the walls were completed in 1855, the only opening was in the western side. This gap was where the gatehouse and associated entry complex was built in 1854 and 1855. The main gate was in place in 1855, while the London-made clock for the top of the structure was installed a year later. In 1856, a mini tornado toppled most of the northern boundary wall, and extensive work was undertaken to rebuild and widen the walls.|$|E

5|$|Fremantle Prison {{comprises}} substantially intact convict era structures, {{including the}} limestone perimeter walls of exceptional heritage significance. Other structures, {{dating from the}} time the precinct was in use as a colonial and state prison, are also significant. The convict era complex includes the 1859 main <b>cell</b> <b>block,</b> chapel and wards, yards and refractory cells; perimeter walls, gate house complex and prison officer residences on the Terrace; service buildings and hospital; south-eastern workshops; ramp access tramway (Fairbairn Street) and Henderson Street Warder's Cottages. Other elements which contribute to the site's overall heritage significance include the western workshops (1900); new division (1907); and conversion of service building to the female division and the addition of an eastern range (1889–1909).|$|E
50|$|Reducing IKr in {{myocardial}} cells prolongs {{the cardiac}} action potential and thus prolongs the QT-interval. In non-cardiac <b>cells,</b> <b>blocking</b> Ikr {{has a different}} effect: it increases the frequency of action potentials.|$|R
40|$|Using {{indirect}} immunofluorescence, we {{have found}} that epidermal growth factor (EGF), at 100 ng/ml, induces centrosomal separation within 20 min in HeLa and 3 T 3 cells.

5|$|The {{government}} department {{in charge of}} the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security Casuarina Prison. Since 1991, the prison has been conserved as a recognised heritage site on state, national, and World Heritage lists, and various restoration works have been undertaken since the 1990s. New uses have been found for various sections of the prison, including a New Business Enterprise Centre in the New Division <b>cell</b> <b>block,</b> and wedding ceremonies in the prison chapels. It has also become a significant tourist attraction, with guided tours since 1991.|$|E
5|$|The hospital, built between 1857 and 1859, was {{a crucial}} {{component}} of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the convict era relied on convict labour, which could only be provided if the convicts were healthy. Located in the north-eastern corner of the prison compound, the building is H-shaped in plan, single storey with rendered and painted limestone walls. It features a wide verandah with timber posts. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main <b>cell</b> <b>block,</b> with the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished, and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle Prison's New Division was {{constructed}} between 1904 and 1907, {{as a response}} to overcrowding. The division continues the façade alignment of the main block. The building, L shaped in plan, is three storeys high of regular coursed pale ashlar limestone blocks with rock-face. Openings are set in brick and freestone and it has a handsome lantern range above the main atrium. The building is visually significant as it complements the main <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> and completes the northern zone of the prison. The interior configuration and cells are significant as an example of an attempt to introduce the separate system to Western Australia, whereby prisoners were completely isolated for {{the first three months of}} their sentence. The division's exercise yard initially used a panopticon to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading its removal within five years.|$|E

5|$|Other {{than his}} stays in hospital, Hess {{spent the rest}} of his life in Spandau prison. His fellow inmates Konstantin von Neurath, Walther Funk and Erich Raeder were {{released}} because of poor health in the 1950s; Karl Dönitz, Baldur von Schirach and Albert Speer served their time and were released; Dönitz in 1956, Schirach and Speer in 1966. The 600-cell prison continued to be maintained for its lone prisoner from Speer and Schirach's release until Hess's death in 1987, at an estimated cost of DM 800,000. Conditions were far more pleasant in the 1980s than in the early years; Hess was allowed to move more freely around the <b>cell</b> <b>block,</b> setting his own routine and choosing his own activities, which included television, films, reading and gardening. A lift was installed so he could more readily access the garden, and he was provided with a medical orderly from 1982 onward.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} building was for seven one-story cell blocks, {{but by the time}} <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> three was completed, the prison was already over capacity.
