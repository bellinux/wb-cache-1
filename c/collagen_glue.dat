40|$|Anastomotic leakage is {{a common}} {{complication}} of colorectal surgery. To date, no clinical study exists showing a significant effect in reducing its frequency by sealing the anastomosis with a fibrin glue-coated collagen patch; {{the aim of this}} study was to demonstrate the efficacy of Tachosil. Methoda. We considered patients undergoing open resective colorectal surgery. In selected cases, Tachosil patches were wrapped around the anastomotic line. The onset of anastomotic leak was either defined clinically and investigated by contrast enema and CT scan. Results. From January 2010 to February 2011, 63 patients underwent colorectal surgery at our Institute. We recorded six major surgical complications; all complicated cases were in the no-Tachosil group. A shorter mean post-operative stay of 7. 2 days was observed for patients where Tachosil was applied compared to 9. 3 days for patients of no-Tachosil group. These difference was mainly related to anastomotic insufficiences recorded in the no-Tachosil group. Fibrin-coated <b>collagen</b> <b>glue</b> is used in different fields of surgery to improve hemostasis and anastomotic healing. Our experience confirmed its safety with a reduced incidence of anastomotic leak. These experience is based on few, non-randomized cases and therefore cannot demonstrate a real efficacy of Tachosil in anastomotic leak prevention...|$|E
40|$|The {{foodstuff}} gelatine {{has had a}} {{long and}} successful history. In ancient times it was used as a ‘‘biological adhesive’’, {{and in the course of}} time it progressed to industrial manufacture and diverse applications. Some 8000 years ago, cave dwellers in what is now the Middle East were able to produce glue from animal tissues. Some 3000 years later, the Ancient Egyptians were well aware of its func-tionality and used a type of wood glue produced from collagen as an adhesive to glue their items of furniture together. And, at the court of Henry VIII of England (1491 – 1547), pickled dishes with ‘‘glittering calves’-foot jelly’ ’ were on the menu at every banquet. It was in the Napoleonic era, however, that gelatine experienced its first real boom: it was used as a source of protein to feed the French when meat became scarce during the blockade of their ports by the British navy. And, of course, modern pharmaceuticals and photography would be unthinkable today without gelatine. The use of gelatine for health purposes has been documented since as early as the Middle Ages. For example, Hildegard von Bingen, Benedictine Abbess and universal scholar, recommended in her ‘‘Physica’ ’ around 1150 that ‘‘frequent and adequate’ ’ portions of a broth made from calves ’ feet was good for joint pain. Today, science has proven just how right she was. 1. 1. 2 It All Began with Glue However, archeologists have established that certain forms of crude gelatine were used much earlier. Chemical and microbiological analyses carried out at the Weizmann Institute in Israel on samples taken from a cave near the Dead Sea clearly show that its inhabitants in the New Stone Age knew much about the ad-hesive strength of <b>collagen</b> <b>glue</b> and used it for numerous purposes.

40|$|An in vivo murine vascularized chamber {{model has}} been shown to {{generate}} spontaneous angiogenesis and new tissue formation. This experiment aimed to assess the effects of common biological scaffolds on tissue growth in this model. Either laminin- 1, type I <b>collagen,</b> fibrin <b>glue,</b> hyaluronan, or sea sponge was inserted into silicone chambers containing the epigastric artery and vein, one end was sealed with adipose tissue and the other with bone wax, then incubated subcutaneously. After 2, 4, or 6 weeks, tissue from chambers containing <b>collagen</b> I, fibrin <b>glue,</b> hyaluronan, or no added scaffold (control) had small amounts of vascularized connective tissue. Chambers containing sea sponge had moderate connective tissue growth together with a mild "foreign body" inflammatory response. Chambers containing laminin- 1, at a concentration 10 -fold lower than its concentration in Matrigel™, resulted in a moderate adipogenic response. In summary, (1) biological hydrogels are resorbed and gradually replaced by vascularized connective tissue; (2) sponge-like matrices with large pores support connective tissue growth within the pores and become encapsulated with granulation tissue; (3) laminin-containing scaffolds facilitate adipogenesis. It is concluded that the nature and chemical composition of the scaffold exerts a significant influence on the amount and type of tissue generated in this in vivo chamber model...|$|R
40|$|Osteoclasts, {{as well as}} preosteoclasts, show {{different}} adhesion {{features in}} relationship to the substrate on which cells are grown, i. e. the formation of either podosomes belt or sealing zones. Podosomes belt forms on non bone substrates, i. e. when cells interact with glass coverslips or culture plates, whereas sealing zones form when cells grow on bone-like substrates. Podosomes belt corresponds to numerous F-actin columns arranged at the cell periphery, whereas the sealing zone could be defined as a unique large band of actin [1]. In the study of bone resorption mechanisms, the employ of bone slices is not perfectly suitable to investigate actin rearrangement due to cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction, since it doesn't allow to obtain high quality preparations to be examined both by light and electronmicroscopy (TEM and SEM). In particular, TEM preparation requires demineralization which could influence the chemical properties of either bone slices or bone-like composites. Moreover, the use of bone slices as scaffold, although extensive, doesn't allow ultrastructural details that are necessary in the study of mineral resorption by monocytes or preosteoclasts [2, 3]. The aim {{of the present study was}} to set up an experimental model for the study of cell-ECM interaction between either monocytes or early differentiating osteoclasts and a mineralized ECM. RAW 264. 7 cells (a monocyte-macrophage cell line that can differentiate in osteoclasts) were cultured on a composite constituted by calcium phosphate and type I collagen to investigate actin polymerization and podosome formation. This bone-like composite doesn't present the mechanical bone properties, but it is constituted by the main bone components and exhibits the advantage that <b>collagen</b> <b>glues</b> the mineral phase in clusters that can be either added to cell cultures or applied on coverslips, as well as to the culture medium. Light and fluorescence microscopy, as well as TEM and SEM techniques were employed. Results showed that the use of this bone-like composite allowed to obtain useful morphological information about the resorption activity of RAW 264. 7 cell line differentiating towards the osteoclastic phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Fistula-in-ano is {{the most}} common form of perineal sepsis. Typically, a fistula {{includes}} an internal opening, a track, and an external opening. The external opening might acutely appear following infection and/or an abscess, or more insiduously in a chronic manner. Management includes control of infection, assessment of the fistulous track in relation to the anal sphincter muscle, and finally, definitive treatment of the fistula. Fistulotomy was the most commonly used mode of management, but concerns about post-fistulotomy incontinence prompted the use of sphincter preserving techniques such as advancement flaps, fibrin <b>glue,</b> <b>collagen</b> fistula plug, ligation of the intersphincteric fistula track, and stem cells. Many descriptive and comparative studies have evaluated these different techniques with variable outcomes. The lack of consistent results, level I evidence, or long-term follow-up, as well as the heterogeneity of fistula pathology has prevented a definitive treatment algorithm. This article will review the most commonly available modalities and techniques for managing idiopathic fistula-in-ano...|$|R
5000|$|From the Greek for glue, kolla, {{the word}} {{collagen}} means [...] "glue producer" [...] and {{refers to the}} early process of boiling the skin and sinews of horses and other animals to obtain <b>glue.</b> <b>Collagen</b> adhesive was used by Egyptians about 4,000 years ago, and Native Americans used it in bows about 1,500 years ago. The oldest glue in the world, carbon-dated as more than 8,000 years old, {{was found to be}} collagen—used as a protective lining on rope baskets and embroidered fabrics, and to hold utensils together; also in crisscross decorations on human skulls. Collagen normally converts to gelatin, but survived due to dry conditions. Animal glues are thermoplastic, softening again upon reheating, so they are still used in making musical instruments such as fine violins and guitars, which may have to be reopened for repairs—an application incompatible with tough, synthetic plastic adhesives, which are permanent. Animal sinews and skins, including leather, have been used to make useful articles for millennia.|$|R
40|$|Object. The {{extended}} transsphenoidal {{approach to}} the suprasellar region has the advantages of minimal invasiveness and brain manipulation in the surgical treatment of small to medium lesions. At the same time, however, it carries {{a higher risk of}} postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and related complications than those for the standard transsphenoidal approach. Effective reconstruction of large skull base defects is a major concern in such extended approaches and remains challenging. Methods. Between January 2004 and April 2006, 21 patients affected by different suprasellar lesions underwent the extended endoscopic endonasal transtuberculum-transplanum approach. Three different techniques were used for the skull base reconstructions. In all cases, dehydrated human pericardium (Tutoplast) for dural reconstruction and a copolymer Of L-lactic acid and glycolic acid (LactoSorb) as a bone Substitute were used. <b>Collagen</b> sponges, fibrin <b>glue,</b> and an inflated Foley balloon catheter were also used to fill the sphenoid sinus cavity. Results. Two cases of postoperative CSF leaks (9. 5 %) and one case of mycotic sinusitis (4. 8 %) occurred following the intradural (inlay) and intraextradural (inlay-overlay) graft positioning. No cases of postoperative CSF leakage occurred in cases in which the extradural-only reconstruction procedure was applied. No meningitis or other complications related to the closure were noticed. Conclusions. The rate of postoperative CSF leakage after an extended {{approach to the}} suprasellar area is higher compared with that following standard pituitary surgery. Reconstruction after craniopharyngioma surgery exposes patients to an increased risk of postoperative CSF leaks. The extradural (overlay) technique was found to be the most effective in assuring a watertight closure...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether a collagen fleece kept {{in place by}} fibrin glue might seal off a colorectal anastomosis, provide reinforcement, and subsequently improve anastomotic healing. Wistar rats underwent a 1 -cm left-sided colonic resection followed by a 4 -suture end-to-end anastomosis. They were then {{randomly assigned to one}} of three treatment groups: no additional intervention (control, n = 20), the anastomosis covered with fibrin glue (fibrin glue, n = 20), the anastomosis covered with a collagen fleece, kept in place with fibrin <b>glue</b> (<b>collagen</b> fleece, n = 21). At either 3 or 7 days follow-up, anastomotic bursting pressure was measured and tissue was obtained for histology and collagen content assessment after which animals were sacrificed. Three rats in the control (15 %), three in the fibrin glue (15 %), and one in the collagen group (4. 8 %) died due to anastomotic complications (P = 0. 497). Anastomotic bursting pressures were not significantly different between groups at 3 and 7 days follow-up (P = 0. 659 and P = 0. 427, respectively). However, bowel obstructions occurred significantly more often in the collagen group compared to the control group (14 / 21 vs. 3 / 20, P = 0. 003). Collagen contents were not different between groups, but histology showed a more severe inflammation in the collagen group compared to the other groups at both 3 and 7 days follow-up. A collagen fleece kept in place by fibrin glue does not improve healing of colonic anastomoses in rats. Moreover, this technique induces significantly more bowel obstructions in rats, warranting further study before being translated to a clinical settin...|$|R
