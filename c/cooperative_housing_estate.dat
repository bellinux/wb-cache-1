40|$|This thesis explores various tenure {{models as}} a means to {{understand}} development in transition. The emergence of new markets, aspirations, needs and varied agendas of the actors in the LSM <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Housing</b> <b>Estate</b> in Lublin, Poland, has resulted in conflicts in tenure claims to land and building. The tenure options that evolve from these conflicts are in effect choices that open up for the community. This thesis recognizes {{the fact that there are}} other development models apart from the Western free market model that have their advantages and disadvantages in given situations. Development models that have been used in other countries are considered end-state scenarios, which become a means to explore tenure options. The end-state scenarios could range from individual rights (private freehold) to communal tenure holding. Here the argument is that, in-between these end-state scenarios exists a range of development options that can be used in the transition stage. The end-state scenarios discussed are: the Western market model, Cooperative land banks, Sweden's leasehold of land and rental housing system, Britain's council housing, US housing cooperatives, and Hong Kong's land management system. Tradeoffs between scenarios are evaluated by fIltering each scenario through six criteria: efficiency, equity, subsidy, management and community participation, mobility, and difficulty in transition. The implications of each scenario on the LSM Housing Cooperative are studied under three site specific issues: development of neighborhoods, development of the Zana street commercial area and development of vacant land in the estate. An evaluation of end-state scenarios against the various criteria, indicates that given the transition process, there is no single model that can be applied uniformly. The housing neighborhoods, Zana street and vacant land would benefit most if developed with different models. Scenarios that appear more workable than the others are: the Western market model, Cooperative land bank, Hong Kong's land management system and the US housing cooperative. Transference of models does not ensure their success in LSM. Simplicity and clarity of the models is critical to the transition period and the identified models need to be modified to adapt to local conditions. The LSM case study exemplifies housing estates in Poland and other countries undergoing transition in Eastern Europe. This thesis does not attempt to recommend a conclusive tenure system, but gives a methodology that would help identify a tenure system. by Sanjay M. Kumar. Thesis (M. S.)

About 40 % of Prague's residents live in <b>housing</b> <b>estates,</b> which are an indispensable part of urban structure of the capital city, and therefore the thesis focuses on Prague's <b>housing</b> <b>estates.</b> Through a literature research the theoretical part deals in major with the circumstances of creation and specifics of Czech panel housing with focus on the Prague <b>housing</b> <b>estates.</b> The theoretical part concludes that the future of <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> will depend on the attitude of public authorities and its residents as we cannot rely on the fact that leaving <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> their own development will not lead to their degradation.
