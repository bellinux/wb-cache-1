40|$|The aim of {{our work}} is to study numerically <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> as the effectsof a fire line {{spreading}} through surface fuel under a tree canopy. Theobjective {{was to assess the}} usual assumptions made when one uses the Van Wagner criteria, which are indeed simple predictive models for <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> height, to estimate <b>crown</b> <b>scorch.</b> For this purpose the FIRESTAR 2 D and FIRETEC wildfire simulators are used. We simulated the fire line by a heat source at ground level and mainly investigated the temperature field. As a first step, we ran computations of thermal plumes with no-wind and with no canopy, for first comparison to plume theory. The influence of crown existence on the temperature field above the heat source, as well as on <b>crown</b> <b>scorch,</b> was then investigated. As a second step, the effect of a wind to the plume, as well as to <b>crown</b> <b>scorch,</b> was shown for the no-canopy and canopy cases...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a study linking mechanistic relationships among pre injury, tree physiological condition, and bark beetle (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) susceptibility. <b>Crown</b> <b>scorch</b> of 40 Pinus ponderosa trees was estimated in a naturally regenerated stand that was thinned and prescribed burned in winter and early spring 2000. Net photosynthetic rate (Pn) of undamaged foliage was higher in heavily and severely than moderately and lightly scorched trees. This trend was more pronounced in the dry season (June) than the wet season (August). This suggests the mechanism underlying the increase in Pn was an improvement in water relations. This was also supported by differences observed in predawn water potential and stomatal conductance (gs). Constitutive resin volume did not differ among <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> classes in June, but was negatively related to <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> intensity in September. This suggests that constitutive resin was formed and stored before pre injury, and therefore not strongly affected by <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> levels in June. Induced resin production (resin produced after depletion of constitutive resin) generally decreased with increasing <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> in both June and September. Induced resin appeared {{to be related to}} carbon available for resin synthesis. The proportion of successful colonization attempts by Ips spp. and Dendroctonus spp. was low throughout the season. Colonization of Ips sp. and Dendroctonus spp. was not spatially separated in host trees. Colonization attempts were generally positively related to intensity of <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> in both pheromone and no-pheromone treatments. This finding suggests that pheromones attracted insects to the tree, but host physiological condition or other factors ultimately determined host colonization. Our results also suggest that intensity of <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> may affect colonization attempts of Ips and Dendroctonus spp. on P. ponderosa trees...|$|E
40|$|Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) were {{monitored}} for 4 {{years following}} three wildfires. Logistic regression analyses were used to develop models predicting the probability of attack by Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotugae Hopkins, 1905) and the probability of Douglas-fir mortality within 4 year following fire. Percent crown volume scorched (<b>crown</b> <b>scorch),</b> cambium injury, diameter at breast height (DBH), and stand density index for Douglas-fir were most important for predicting Douglas-fir beetle attacks. A nonlinear relationship between <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> and cambium injury was observed, suggesting that beetles did not preferentially attack trees with both maximum <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> and cambium injury, 1 and 2 years following fire. <b>Crown</b> <b>scorch,</b> cambium injury, DBH, and presence/absence of beetle attack {{were the most important}} variables for predicting postfire Douglas-fir mortality. As DBH increased, the predicted probability of mortality decreased for unattacked trees but increased for attacked trees. Field sampling suggested that ocular estimated of bark char may not be a reliable predictor of cambium injury. Our results emphasize the important role of Douglas-fir beetle in tree mortality patterns following fire, and the models offer improved prediction of Douglas-fir mortality for use in areas with or without Douglas-fir beetle populations...|$|E
40|$|Fire {{damage and}} tree {{characteristics}} of mixed deciduous oak woodlands were recorded after a prescription burn {{in the summer}} of 1999 on Mt. Hamilton Range, Santa Clara County, California. Trees were tagged and monitored {{to determine the effects of}} fire intensity on damage, recovery and survivorship. Fire-caused mortality was low; 2 -year post-burn survey indicates that only three oaks have died from the low intensity ground fire. Using ANOVA, there was an overall significant difference for percent tree <b>crown</b> <b>scorched</b> and bole char height between plots, but not between tree-size classes. Using logistic regression, tree diameter and aspect predicted crown resprouting. Crown damage was also a significant predictor of resprouting with the likelihood increasing with percent scorched. Both valley and blue oaks produced crown resprouts on trees with 100 percent of their <b>crown</b> <b>scorched.</b> Although overall tree damage was low, crown resprouts developed on 80 percent of the trees and were found as shortly as two weeks after the fire. Stand structural characteristics have not been altered substantially by the event. Long term monitoring of fire effects will provide information on what changes fire causes to stand structure, its possible usefulness as a management tool, and how it should be applied to the landscape to achieve management objectives...|$|R
30|$|The {{reason that}} the Ryan and Amman {{mortality}} model is so widely applied is due to its simplicity. Only two inputs are required to run the model: bark thickness and percent <b>crown</b> volume <b>scorched.</b> Bark thickness {{is used as a}} measure of thermal resistance to the cambium in the tree stem (Butler and Dickinson 2010) and is calculated from species-specific coefficients and diameter at breast height (1.37 m above ground; DBH). Bark thickness coefficients are included for 219 species, allowing prediction of fire-induced tree mortality for most forest species in the US. <b>Crown</b> volume <b>scorch</b> is calculated from either flame length or <b>scorch</b> height and <b>crown</b> characteristics. In FOFEM, the user must also enter tree height and live crown ratio, which is then used to calculate live crown length and crown base height, and convert <b>crown</b> length <b>scorched</b> to <b>crown</b> volume <b>scorched</b> (Reinhardt et al. 1997). This series of nested models allows mortality prediction for any tree for which bark thickness, tree height, <b>crown</b> ratio, and <b>scorch</b> height are known. The FOFEM graphics option allows easy visualization of general thresholds at which the chance that a tree will die from fire for a given flame length or scorch height begins to sharply increase along the predicted mortality response curvet. Thus, FOFEM can be used for pre-fire planning purposes to develop burn prescriptions that help meet specific tree-mortality related objectives. For example, burn objectives often include acceptable limits to mortality of trees over a specific DBH, or targets to kill a proportion of the smaller-diameter trees that can act as ladder fuels (Ryan et al. 2013).|$|R
30|$|The {{simplicity}} of the Ryan and Amman mortality model also limits its usefulness for post-fire planning purposes. In this situation, mortality models are typically applied to an individual tree for which the actual <b>crown</b> volume <b>scorch</b> percentage is known. Directly entering the <b>crown</b> volume <b>scorch</b> value will always provide better estimates of tree mortality than will calculating scorch as described above. In addition, other fire injury variables and secondary effects such as bark beetle attacks may also be known. Expanding the mortality models in FOFEM to allow for direct inputs of fire injury and to account for secondary factors could possibly increase the predictive accuracy of post-fire tree mortality.|$|R
3000|$|The {{effect of}} fire {{intensity}} on the efficacy or the raking treatment was investigated using mixed effects logistic regression. Fire intensity {{is defined as}} “the energy released during various phases of the fire” (Keeley 2009), and <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> is a commonly used proxy for fire intensity (Van Wagner 1973, Williams et al. 1998, Twidwell et al. 2009). We used percent crown volume scorched instead of maximum <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> height or relative scorch height as our measure of fire intensity because it {{is viewed as a}} more accurate assessment of <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> (Peterson 1985, Twidwell et al. 2009). The effect of fire intensity on raking treatment efficacy was tested by including an interaction between raking and fire intensity category in a GLMM model. Low intensity was defined as trees with crowns that were not scorched (n = 172), moderate intensity was defined as trees with percent crown volume scorched between 1 % and 80 % (n = 181), and high intensity was defined as trees with a percent crown volume scorched > 80 % (n = 104). A <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> value of 80 % was chosen for the high intensity cutoff because this is within the range (75 % to 90 %) often cited as causing death in conifers (McHugh and Kolb 2003, Fowler et al. 2010 [...]...|$|E

The dNBR is an index of burn severity and is derived from comparisons of pre- and post-fire Thematic Mapper imagery with a 30 m resolution (Kotliar et al. 2003, Key and Benson 2006). We calculated the mean dNBR within 100 m buffers (dNBR 100) at each survey plot. We also evaluated burn severity in the field based {{on the condition of}} overstory trees in a 30 m radius area (severity plot) centered at each point count station (Figure 2). We used the following six field severity ranks: unburned (no evidence of needle or bole scorch), low (bole scorch only), low-moderate (< 33 % <b>crown</b> <b>scorch),</b> moderate (33 % to 67 % <b>crown</b> <b>scorch),</b> moderate-high (> 67 % <b>crown</b> <b>scorch),</b> and high (100 % needle consumption).

Species, DBH, and percentage <b>crown</b> volume <b>scorched</b> or percentage <b>crown</b> length <b>scorched</b> were assessed for each tree within 1 year post fire.

Though species-level comparisons for these species would be ideal, {{it was not}} possible with the available data. For the majority of trees, cambium kill rating (CKR) and bark beetle attacks were also assessed. All trees were monitored annually for three years post fire for mortality. Trees were considered dead when no green foliage remained in the crown, regardless of beetle attack timing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Understory {{prescribed}} burning {{was conducted in}} an immature Pinusponderosa (ponderosa pine) stand in southwestern Colorado during three seasons, late spring, midsummer, and autumn. Tree mortality from various levels of <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> was compared for the different seasons of injury. A total of 526 trees of different sizes, with <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> ranging from 20 to 100 %, were moni-tored annually for 10 years. Over 80 % of the 10 -year mortality from injury in all ee seasons had occurred by year 3, with over 90 % ng by year 4. Mortality of trees scorched {{in the spring and}} summer was about 2. 5 times greater than that in the autumn for similar crown damage. Most trees larger than 18 cm in diameter survived autumn injury, even with greater than 90 % scorching. Following spring and summer injury, trees smaller than 10 cm in diameter died readily with greater than 50 % scorching, but about 90 % <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> was required by large trees to be lethal. A logistic regression model was developed to pre-dict the probability of mortality given tree size, scorch class, and season of injury. Because mortality was similar within scorch classes less than 90 %, they were combined into a single class. Scorch thresholds with large increases in mortality occurred at 90 % and 100 % <b>crown</b> <b>scorch.</b> The season variable includes two groups, dormant (autumn) and growing (spring and summer). Use of this model to predict mortality of immature P. ponderosa is appropriate where stand, fuel, and fire conditions resemble those of this study...|$|E
30|$|We scaled TBI {{from zero}} to one; where 0 {{corresponds}} to a tree with 100 % live crown, 0.5 corresponds to a tree with 100 % <b>crown</b> <b>scorch,</b> and 1 corresponds to a tree with 100 % needle consumption.|$|E
30|$|Crown {{injury is}} often the most {{important}} predictor of post-fire tree mortality, and most logistic regression-based models use some measure of crown injury (Sieg et al. 2006, Woolley et al. 2012). Consistent with this, <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> or crown kill is included in all the species-specific models presented here. This is not surprising as tree survival is highly dependent {{on the amount of}} needles available for carbon acquisition via photosynthesis, and reductions in crown after fire reduce net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance (Sparks et al. 2016), even though water use efficiency can increase (Wallin et al. 2003). FOFEM predicts scorch height from flame length using the model in Van Wagner (1973), and this model does not distinguish between needle kill and bud kill (see Dickinson and Johnson 2001 for detailed processes involved in modeling crown tissue death). This difference can be substantial for ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine (Hood et al. 2010) and indicates areas of the crown that can potentially recover if only the needles are scorched, but buds and branches are not killed (Dieterich 1979, Fowler et al. 2010). Our post-fire crown kill model is about 5 % more accurate than the <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> model, and we recommended using the crown kill model when possible for ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine, especially when large differences exist in <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> and crown kill. Further research into the factors affecting plant hydraulic integrity (West et al. 2016) and thermal tolerance of bud and foliage tissues due to physical and physiological properties is needed to better understand and model crown injury from fire (Hare 1961, Dickinson and Johnson 2001). Michaletz and Johnson (2006) developed a <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> model capable of predicting differences in scorch and bud kill heights. This model deserves additional examination and validation as a possible replacement for the Van Wagner (1973) model in FOFEM.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 Pacific Northwest oak {{woodlands}} and savannas are fire-resilient communities {{dependent on}} frequent, low-severity fire {{to maintain their}} structure and understory species diversity, and to prevent encroachment by fire-sensitive competitors. These important ecosystems have been severely reduced in both extent and quality during {{more than a century}} of land use change and altered fire regimes. The re-introduction of fire into these transformed ecosystems is viewed as essential to their restoration, yet can be fraught with potential unintended consequences. We examined oak response following re-introduction of fire into two distinct oak ecosystems: formerly suppressed California black oak (Quercus kelloggii Newb.) woodlands subject to repeated wildfire, and Garry oak (Quercus garryana Douglas ex Hook.) woodlands experiencing “first entry” restoration burns. Both the black oak woodlands of Lassen National Forest, California, and the Garry oak woodlands of Joint-Base Lewis-McChord, Washington have experienced shifts in vegetative structure and composition during long fire-free intervals. Black oak canopy dominance and vigor of resprouts were positively correlated with increased fire severity (R 2 = 0. 41, 0. 49, respectively), but black oaks that had sprouted following top-kill in the first fire were easily top-killed in the second fire, even at low severities, implying that long-term survival of regenerating black oaks in fire-prone regions is uncertain. Top-kill of Garry oak was rare (8 %) in three prescribed burns, despite high levels (95 %) of <b>crown</b> <b>scorching</b> and irrespective of proportional duff consumption around oak bases, demonstrating the high resilience of Garry oaks to first entry burns when compared to historic fires. Bud kill (as measured by lack of bud burst the spring following burns) in Garry oak crowns was correlated with <b>crown</b> <b>scorching</b> (R 2 = 0. 42), but responses were highly variable, especially at high levels of scorching. The results of these studies indicate that fire adaptations may be specific to particular fire regimes, and that vegetative responses in oak woodlands are highly dependent on the adaptive traits of individual species. Restoration efforts in oak woodlands {{are more likely to be}} successful when reintroduction of fire is carefully tailored to target species, and modeled on characteristics of past disturbance, taking into account altered conditions of modern landscapes...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Presentation date: 2002 - 10 - 16 Delayed tree {{mortality}} is an unpredictable occurrence when prescribed burning is implemented. Fire scorched trees may die {{as the result}} of <b>crown</b> <b>scorching,</b> stem charring, root injury, bark beetle attack, or through a combination of these factors. This study examined ponderosa pine mortality and the incidence of two bark beetle species (Dendroctonus brevicomis LeConte and Ips pini Say Coleoptera: Scolytidae) following spring and fall prescribed burning on four replicated ponderosa pine stands. There was a positive linear relationship for total tree mortality and Scolytidae incidence with stem char height. No relationship in total tree mortality or Scolytidae incidence was observed between seasons of burn when accounting for stem char height. The presence of established bark beetle galleries was negatively correlated with external stem charring within destructively sampled ponderosa pines that died following burn application. In a related study, woodpecker use and decay dynamics of ponderosa pines dying post-fire were assessed. Woodpecker bark foraging was closely associated with the presence of bark beetles and woodborers (Coleoptera: Buprestidae and Cerambycidae). There was a positive linear relationship between woodpecker cavity excavation and snag DBH. The probability of a snag possessing a woodpecker cavity was significantly greater if the snag had sustained a broken top. Wood deterioration within destructively sampled ponderosa pine snags was negatively influenced by charring sustained to the bark in comparison to uncharred portions of the tree...|$|R
40|$|It is {{becoming}} clear that fires in boreal forests are not uniformly stand-replacing. On the contrary, marked variation in fire severity, measured as tree mortality, {{has been found}} both within and among individual fires. It {{is important to understand}} the conditions under which this variation can arise. We integrated forest sample plot data, tree allometries and historical forest fire records within a diameter class-structured model of 1. 0 ha patches of mono-specific black spruce and jack pine stands in northern Québec, Canada. The model accounts for crown fire initiation and vertical spread into the canopy. It uses empirical relations between fire intensity, scorch height, the percent of <b>crown</b> <b>scorched</b> and tree mortality to simulate fire severity, specifically the percent reduction in patch basal area due to fire-caused mortality. A random forest and a regression tree analysis of a large random sample of simulated fires were used to test for an effect of fireline intensity, stand structure, species composition and pyrogeographic regions on resultant severity. Severity increased with intensity and was lower for jack pine stands. The proportion of simulated fires that burned at high severity (e. g. > 75 % reduction in patch basal area) was 0. 80 for black spruce and 0. 11 for jack pine. We identified thresholds in intensity below which there was a marked sensitivity of simulated fire severity to stand structure, and to interactions between intensity and structure. We found no evidence for a residual effect of pyrogeographic region on simulated severity, after the effects of stand structure and species composition were accounted for. The model presented here was able to produce variation in fire severity under a range of fire intensity conditions. This suggests that variation in stand structure is one of the factors causing the observed variation in boreal fire severity...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{demonstration of}} stem damage {{as a predictor}} of fire-caused mortality for ponderosa pine Phillip van Mantgem and Mark Schwartz Abstract: We subjected 159 small ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.) to treatments designed to test the relative importance of stem damage {{as a predictor of}} postfire mortality. The treatments consisted of a group with the basal bark artificially thinned, a second group with fuels removed {{from the base of the}} stem, and an untreated control. Following prescribed burning, <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> severity was equivalent among the groups. Postfire mortality was significantly less frequent in the fuels removal group than in the bark removal and control groups. No model of mortal-ity for the fuels removal group was possible, because dead trees constituted < 4 % of subject trees. Mortality in the bark removal group was best predicted by <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> and stem scorch severity, whereas death in the control group was predicted by <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> severity and bark thickness. The relative lack of mortality in the fuels removal group and the increased sensitivity to stem damage in the bark removal group suggest that stem damage is a critical determinant of postfire mortality for small ponderosa pine.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the applicability of}} mastication as a fuel treatment alternative within Northern Rocky Mountain moist and dry forests to treat post-harvest activity slash (moist forest) and standing trees (dry forest). On the moist forest site, we compared four different slash treatments, mastication, machine grapple piling, lop and scatter, and a control within a wildland urban interface setting {{to determine the effects}} of these treatments on soil nutrition, forest floor depth, and woody debris distributions. We randomly assigned the slash treatments and controls to 12 one-acre plots. Nitrogen, soil carbon, and magnesium concentrations within the soil components were not significantly different among the slash treatments. Lopped and scattered sites had significantly here duff depths than duff depths within the other slash treatments and control. Two years after treatment the structure and character of the masticated fuels was such that these areas resembled the grapple piled sites. We established the dry forest site to treat excess standing non-commercial 80 -year old ponderosa pine. We masticated 20 acres in the fall; six one-acre plots were randomly located within the masticated area. We applied prescribed fire the following spring to three of the plots the remaining three plots were post-masticated controls. During the prescribed fire, flame lengths were low (3 ̆c 0. 5 m), although combustion continued to occur from smoldering. The radiation and convection was of sufficient intensity that <b>crown</b> <b>scorching</b> raised canopy base heights by 3 to 5 m. A critical element of the prescription was that lower duff moistures had to be greater than 100 percent during burning, therefore, there was little to no consumption of the forest floor even with the smoldering fire. Based on these results, we recommend that when burning masticated material particular attention to lower duff moisture is critical to minimize the down ward heat pulse...|$|R

Two-year post-fire preliminary models were developed for incensecedar, Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine and white fir.

40|$|Abstract. With growing {{debate over}} the impacts of post-fire salvage logging in conifer forests of the western USA, {{managers}} need accurate assessments of tree survival when significant proportions of the crown have been scorched. The accuracy of fire severity measurements will be affected if trees that initially appear to be fire-killed prove to be viable after longer observation. Our goal was to quantify {{the extent to which}} three common Sierra Nevada conifer species may ‘flush ’ (produce new foliage in the year following a fire from scorched portions of the crown) and survive after fire, and to identify tree or burn characteristics associated with survival. We found that, among ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex. Laws) and Jeffrey pines (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf) with 100 % initial <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> (no green foliage following the fire), the majority of mature trees flushed, and survived. Red fir (Abies magnifica A. Murr.) with high <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> (mean = 90 %) also flushed, and most large trees survived.

30|$|Differences in {{severity}} of the initial entry burns heavily impacted our overall results. Fuel data was not collected prior to or immediately after our initial entry burns, but the initial entry fall burns were more severe than the initial entry spring burns. The initial fall burns caused nearly three times more mortality to the pine overstory (dbh ≥ 7.0 cm) than the initial spring burns (29 % and 11 % respectively) (Thies et al. 2005). While plot area burned was similar for both seasons, the initial fall burns consumed more of the litter and duff mounds {{at the base of}} trees, and caused higher bole and <b>crown</b> <b>scorching</b> (Thies et al. 2005). Additionally, the initial entry fall burns resulted in significant reductions in the forest floor depth measured four years post burn, while spring burns did not (Kerns et al. 2011), a finding similar to another study in the Blue Mountain Ecoregion approximately 30 km to the north (Progar et al. 2017). The nearly 150 % increase we documented for 1000 hr fuels in the fall 5 yr reburn treatment between reburns one and two is due to the higher mortality in the initial fall burns. Transect-based methods like we used here count downed dead woody debris, so the standing dead trees killed by the initial entry burns are rarely recorded as fuel until they fall. But, even in dry climates, fire-killed ponderosa pine begin falling within a few years, contributing limbs and stems to surface fuel loads. In southwestern Colorado, fire-killed ponderosa pine snags began falling within one to two years, with smaller diameter and trees killed by spring burns falling first, but, after 10 years, 75 % of all fire-killed trees had fallen (Harrington 1996). The increased 1000 hr fuel level we documented between reburns one and two in the fall 5 yr treatments is maintained throughout the remainder of the study period and, with the slow decomposition rates of dry interior forests, in combination with low consumption of 1000 hr fuel during the reburns (e.g., reburns two barely consumed 1 Mg ha− 1), is likely to persist for considerable time. Although it did not reach the level of statistical significance in the 2014 analysis, a similar dynamic of increasing 1000 hr fuels resulting from initial burn mortality also occurred in the fall 15 yr treatments (D. Westlind, personal observation). Mortality from initial fires and subsequent snag and limb fall resulting in similar fuel increases following burning has been observed by others (Agee and Skinner 2005, Reinhardt et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|Highlights - Prescribed burns can be feasibly {{conducted}} in stands {{as young as}} 12 years old. - Giant sequoia had exceptionally high survival; sugar pine had the lowest survival. - Pruning had minimal effects on survival. - Spring burns in young stands killed seven times as many trees as fall burns. Abstract High-severity wildfires increasingly influence forests in the western United States. Extensive research has identified preventative practices including mechanical and prescribed fire treatments to reduce wildfire severity in mature stands. Yet limited research has investigated fuel management treatments in young stands which can be particularly vulnerable to even low intensity fire. To address this gap, we investigated how prescribed fire ({{conducted in}} both the spring and fall) and pre-treatment fuel modifications impacted individual tree damage (or injury) and mortality in nine 13 – 14 year old mixed conifer stands in the central Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Prior to burning, randomly selected trees were pruned to 1. 8 m height above ground. Randomly selected trees were also raked to reduce surrounding surface fuel. Raking fuel from trees reduced the amount of <b>crown</b> volume <b>scorched</b> for all species, but not enough trees died to determine if raking influenced probability of survival. Pruning was associated with reductions in crown consumption height and percent crown volume consumed (5...|$|R
40|$|Aim of study: Understanding fire {{ecology of}} main forest species is {{essential}} for a sound, scientifically based on managing of wildlands and also to assess likely implications due to changes in fire regime under a global change scenario. Few references can be found about fire ecology of Pinus uncinata Ram. (PU). PU species grows in the Central Pyrenees where large, severe wildland fires did not occur frequently in the past. However, several fires with extreme fire behavior have affected PU stands in last years and they might disturb other PU forest in the future. Area of study : Cabdella fire (February 2012), in Lleida province, {{is one of the}} several wildland fires occurred in 2012 (winter season) in the Central Pyrenees. Fire affected a large PU plantation (102 ha) located at 1. 800 - 2, 100 meters above the sea. Material and methods : We have analyzed first order fire effects in three fireline intensity thresholds along three years in terms of mortality ratio, scorched height, percentage of <b>scorched</b> <b>crown</b> volume and bark char height. Main results : PU seems to be a very tolerant species to low and medium fire line intensity but fire effects were very significant when fire line intensity was high. In medium fireline intensity sites, probability of mortality ranged from 15 to 30 % and the dead trees had the highest values on scorched height and percentage of <b>scorched</b> <b>crown</b> volume. Research highlights : Results from this work supports that prescribed burning might be used to efficiently decrease fuel load and fuel vertical continuity while avoiding considerable PU mortality. It also displayed that when fuel management has been implemented, PU mortality might be limited even under extreme fire behavior. Abbreviations used : PU: Pinus uncinata Ram. </p...|$|R
40|$|Tree {{mortality}} {{is often the}} result of both long-term and short-term stress. Growth rate, an indicator of longterm stress, {{is often used to}} estimate probability of death in unburned stands. In contrast, probability of death in burned stands is modeled as a function of short-term disturbance severity. We sought to narrow this conceptual gap by determining (i) whether growth rate, in addition to <b>crown</b> <b>scorch,</b> is a predictor of mortality in burned stands and (ii) whether a single, simple model could predict tree death in both burned and unburned stands. Observations of 2622 unburned and 688 burned Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl. (white fir) in the Sierra Nevada of California, U. S. A., indicated that growth rate {{was a significant predictor of}} mortality in the unburned stands, while both <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> and radial growth were significant predictors of mortality in the burned stands. Applying the burned stand model to unburned stands resulted in an overestimation of the unburned stand mortality rate. While failing to create a general model of tree death for A. concolor, our findings underscore the idea that similar processes may affect mortality in disturbed and undisturbed stands...|$|E
30|$|Significant {{direct and}} delayed {{mortality}} from <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> and insect attack {{has been documented}} in moderate-severity burn patches in recent fires (McHugh and Kolb 2003). Based on an assumption that a substantial percentage of the trees in moderate-severity burn patches die, high- and moderate-severity patches were combined in one subset of the data. We posit that the actual area of fire-related tree mortality (i.e., stand replacement) was probably somewhere between the “high severity” and “high plus moderate severity” patch size estimates.|$|E

Tree mortality from fire can occur from direct effects of the fire such as crown scorching and cambium injury, {{as well as from}} indirect effects such as increased beetle activity (Hood 2010). While <b>crown</b> <b>scorch</b> is often ascribed as being the best predictor of tree mortality (Fowler and Seig 2004), cambial injury is also an important contributing factor to mortality (Peterson and Ryan 1986, Hood et al. 2007 [...]...|$|E
40|$|Wildfires are a {{recurrent}} disturbance in the Mediterranean Basin. However, managers from this region {{are confronted with}} a lack of information on the effects of fire on most woody species, which is required for defining sustainable forest management strategies. Following a large wildfire in central Portugal (2003), we surveyed the area during the first year and assessed the vegetative condition of 1040 burned trees from 11 different species. Among those trees, 755 individuals were selected and monitored annually for 4 years. At the end of the study, almost all the broadleaved trees survived, while most coniferous died. In spite of the low mortality observed in broadleaves, most were top-killed and regenerated only from basal resprouts, which implies a slow recovering process. Quercus suber, however, showed vigorous post-fire crown resprouting and was the most resilient species. We fitted logistic regression models to predict the probability of individual tree mortality and top-kill from fire injury indicators and tree characteristics. Besides {{the differences between the two}} main functional groups (coniferous, broadleaved), bole char height and <b>crown</b> volume <b>scorched</b> or consumed were important predictors of tree responses. Additionally, the main factor determining crown mortality on broadleaved species was bark thickness. The selected models performed well when tested with independent data obtained on four other wildfires. These models have several potential applications and can be useful to managers making pre-fire or post-fire decisions in mixed forest stands in the western Mediterranean Basin...|$|R
40|$|Fire {{is one of}} {{the main}} agents {{controlling}} composition, structure, and function of mixed conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada, CA. Over the past century, there has been a dramatic shift in the role of fire in these forests as fire regimes shifted from low intensity, frequent fires prior to European settlement in the region, to extended periods of fire exclusion due to a policy of active fire suppression. This led to many unintended consequences such as increased stand density, shifts in species composition towards more shade tolerant species such as white fir, and an increase in fire severity and extent when fires do occur due to increased fuels and changing climate. In the past several decades, prescribed fire has become one of the most important tools for forest restoration and management, yet its effects are still not fully understood. This uncertainty is especially true for sugar pine, a species that is being affected not only by changing forest conditions, but also by the introduced pathogen white pine blister rust. These multiple factors, and potential interactions among them, have led to population declines of sugar pine in some areas and have raised concerns about potential mortality during prescribed fire. The goal of this research was to better understand what processes were most important in controlling post-fire mortality of sugar pine, use this information to produce more accurate predictive models of post-fire mortality, and to evaluate simple management actions that could ameliorate the risk of mortality following fire. The first chapter serves as an introduction to the mixed conifer ecosystem and sugar pine in particular. It discusses the main factors that control mortality following prescribed fire and highlights some of the main findings of this research. In the second chapter, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess the direct and indirect effects of multiple variables related to tree health, beetle activity, blister rust, and fire effects and their relative importance in controlling sugar pine mortality following prescribed fire in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Multiple factors are known to influence mortality following fire including fuel loads, fire intensity, beetle activity, and tree size, yet little is known about how these factors interact to control post-fire mortality. A total of 436 sugar pine were measured within three separate prescribed fires in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. SEM was used to evaluate a network of causal relationships between factors that affect post-fire mortality of sugar pine and to assess both direct and indirect effects. Several factors were found to significantly influence post-fire mortality, with <b>crown</b> volume <b>scorch,</b> diameter at breast height (dbh), and post-fire beetle activity showing the strongest effects; though the magnitude of these effects differed among sites. Other factors such as blister rust infection and pre-fire beetle activity had little impact on post-fire mortality. A causal model was developed that considered both indirect and direct effects of multiple factors associated with post-fire mortality while demonstrating the variability in the relative strength of these causal relationships based on specific attributes. This model can be used in forest management to provide a clear understanding of how fire effects interrelate with multiple processes to control post fire sugar pine mortality. The third chapter examined whether the inclusion of pre-fire tree health (based on tree ring records) in models looking at post-fire sugar pine mortality improved model fit over models based on measures of fire effects alone. This study was conducted within an old-growth mixed-conifer forest in Sequoia National Park that had been prescribed burned during 2001 or 2002. Fire effects measured by percent <b>crown</b> volume <b>scorched</b> and stem char height, and pre-fire tree health measured by multiple indices of growth calculated from tree cores and measures of crown health were assessed for 105 sugar pine. Health status (live or dead) was observed prior to the fire, immediately post-fire and five years post-fire. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the effects of fire and pre-fire tree health on post-fire mortality. Models based only on tree size and fire effects were compared to models that included fire effects and measures of pre-fire tree health using AICc. Five years following fire, the model that best predicted mortality included dbh, <b>crown</b> volume <b>scorch,</b> 30 year growth trend, and count of sharp declines over a 30 year period. The inclusion of long-term measures of growth markedly improved model fit compared to models based only on fire effects (&# 916;AICc = 26. 4). However, immediately after fire, models that included measures of pre-fire tree health resulted in only marginal improvements over models based only on measures of fire effects (&# 916;AICc = 2. 1). These results imply that multiple processes, in addition to fire, are functioning to influence delayed mortality and that the inclusion of measures of tree health can provide more accurate predictions of post-fire mortality. Finally, chapter four tests whether raking away duff and litter from the base of the stem can be used as an effective means of reducing sugar pine mortality following prescribed fire. This study was conducted in three prescribed fires in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and included 457 trees, half of which were raked to mineral soil to 0. 5 m away from the stem. Fire effects were assessed and tree mortality was followed for three years after prescribed fires. Overall, raking had no detectable effect on mortality as raked trees averaged 30 % mortality compared to 36 % for unraked trees. There was a significant interaction, however, between raking and average pre-treatment forest floor fuel depth: The predicted probability of survival of a 50 cm dbh tree was 0. 94 vs. 0. 96 when average pre-treatment fuel depth was 0 cm for a raked and unraked tree, respectively. When average pre-treatment forest floor fuel depth was 30 cm, the predicted probability of survival for a raked 50 cm tree was 0. 60 compared to only 0. 07 for an unraked tree. Raking did not affect mortality when fire intensity, measured as percent <b>crown</b> volume <b>scorched,</b> was very low (0 % scorch) or very high (> 80 % scorch), but the raking treatment significantly increased the proportion of trees that survived by 9. 6 % for trees that burned under moderate fire intensity (1 % to 80 % scorch). Raking significantly reduced the likelihood of bole charring and bark beetle activity three years post-fire. This implies that raking can be an effective management tool to reduce tree mortality following prescribed fire under specific fuel and burning conditions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{utilizes}} {{forest stand}} structures and fuel profiles {{to evaluate the}} influence {{of different types of}} silvicultural treatments on fire severity in the Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest (BMEF), located within Lassen National Forest of northeastern California. We compare the severity of fire, assessed based on tree <b>crown</b> and bole <b>scorch</b> on 100 ha experimental treatment plots, following a wildfire started on adjacent national forest lands. Non-parametric statistical testing showed that selective thinning combined with prescribed surface fuel burning is the most effective method for preventing crown fire and minimizing fire severity in an interior Pinus ponderosa forest. These results also suggest that various combinations of the silvicultural treatments assessed can be effective at reducing the potential for severe fire spreading into wildland-urban interface (WUI) areas (supporting defensible space CA law PRC 4291), while suggesting approaches for U. S. Forest Service lands that can result in more resilient ecosystems in similar western U. S. forests treated with similar silvicultural methods...|$|R
