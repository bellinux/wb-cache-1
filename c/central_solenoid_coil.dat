Because of the high magnetic field and current required, the CS and TF coils will be manufactured using Nb 3 Sn based cables, with the cable-in-conduit-conductor technology. The cables are formed by multi-stage cabling of superconducting strands, with the final stage consisting of 6 bundles twisted around a central cooling channel. For electrical and thermal stability the Nb 3 Sn compound is distributed into fine filaments (up to about 50 micrometers diameter) and embedded in a resistive matrix to form the elementary strand. Nb 3 Sn formation requires a solid state diffusion reaction at high temperature, which causes Sn gradient inside the filaments. It {{is well known that}} the critical parameters vary with composition (Sn content) and strain state. In this work the relation between compositional variations and strain is investigated: Nb 3 Sn wires are studied taking into consideration non-homogeneous filaments. A finite element discretization fine enough to take into consideration Sn gradient would result in a number of unknowns which is far beyond the capacity of nowadays computers. Therefore a thermo-mechanical model is developed, based on a self consistent homogenisation, suitably developed to deal with the material non-linearity and the coupling between the thermal and mechanical field. In this way the equivalent homogeneous properties are obtained and the analysis of the wires becomes possible. An appropriate unsmearing technique gives finally the strain state in the real, not homogenized materials...|$|E

We discuss of the effective field vs cable layout parameters, {{the pros and cons}} applicable to fusion. One of the most important challenges is to control the plasma in fusion reactors is design high performance superconducting magnets. Fusion was achieved in JET reactor but actually a self-sustained fusion is the goal to make new fusion energy plants. The project which could achieve this self-sustained fusion reaction is ITER reactor. ITER most powerful magnets are the toroidal field coil and the <b>central</b> <b>solenoid</b> <b>coil.</b> The magnetic fields of these coils are generated through CICC made with superconducting materials.

This Master Dissertation tries to identify what are the best cross-section layout for different rectangular and square cross-section conductors, as compared to the round shape conductors employed in ITER reactor. The work is simulated through a MATLAB software. The simulations can describe the magnetic field distribution in different shaped conductors which share the same area. Once we have the magnetic field distribution we can simulate the critical current density distribution and finally the electric field distribution. With the different electric field distributions for different temperatures we found the current sharing temperature where the electric field average in the conductor is equal to the critical electric field.

40|$|In {{the present}} concept of ITER fusion reactor the Toroidal Field and the <b>Central</b> <b>Solenoid</b> <b>coils</b> {{are made of}} Nb 3 Sn based strands with the Cable-In-Conduit-Conductor (CICC) technology. It {{is well known that}} the {{critical}} parameters of the Nb 3 Sn strand material are strain sensitive; experimental investigations on short samples of basic strands and subsize CICC cables already demonstrated significant effects of residual strain on the critical parameters. In this paper a method is proposed to analyse in detail the thermal strain induced by the cool down from the strand reaction temperature to the coil working conditions. The superconducting strand can be regarded as a very good example of a hierarchical structure, since there is a clear distinction between the micro scale of the Nb 3 Sn filaments, the meso scale of the SC filament groups and the macro scale of the strand, where it can be regarded as homogeneous. A constitutive relation for the homogenised micro and meso-components is deduced from the knowledge of the respective internal structures, starting from an accurate description of the single representative cells. This two-scales homogenisation technique is associated with an efficient Finite Element procedure for computing effective material coefficients to be used with standard orthotropic 3 -D elements in structural codes. Finally the finite elements routines developed for the unsmearing process provide the real stress and strain values over each single material, which are essential to catch the local features needed for engineering design...|$|R

As typical for these large scale applications, the cooldown (CD) from ambient to supercritical He temperature may take a long time, of the order of several weeks, so that it should be useful, also in the perspective of future IC tests, to optimize it. To that purpose, a comprehensive CD model implemented in the 4 C code is developed and presented in this paper. The model is validated against the experimental data of an actual CD scenario, showing a very good agreement between simulation and measurements, from 300 to 4. 5 K. The maximum temperature difference across the coil, which can only be roughly estimated from the measurements, is then extracted from the results of the simulation and shown to be much larger than the maximum value of 50 K, prescribed {{on the basis of the}} allowable thermal stress on the materials. An optimized CD scenario is finally designed using the model for the initial phase of the CD between 300 and 80 K, which allows reducing the needed time by ∼ 20 %, while still satisfying the major constraints.

These trajectories areprecisely calculated, ensuring a realistic distribution of magnetic field- and contact resistance values.

Their critical current, residual resistance ratio and hysteresis losses are measured. It is found that in the range we studied, critical current and hysteresis losses do not change significantly. Residual resistance ratio, however, decreases with increasing heat treatment temperature and time.

This press can transmit a variable (cyclic) transverse force directly to a cable section of 400 mm length at a temperature of 4. 2 K (or higher). To explore life-time cycling, we tested a CSMC Nb/sub 3 /Sn conductor up to 40, 000 cycles. The coupling loss and the associated interstrand resistance between various strands and strand bundles are measured at various loads. The force on the cable and the displacement are monitored {{in order to determine the}} effective cable Young's modulus and the mechanical heat generation. Some aspects of strand deformation in CICC's are discussed. The test results are discussed in view of previous press results and data extracted from the ITER model coil tests...|$|R
40|$|The US ITER Project Office (USIPO) is {{responsible}} for the ITER <b>central</b> <b>solenoid</b> (CS) contribution to the ITER project. The <b>Central</b> <b>Solenoid</b> Insert (CSI) project will allow ITER validation the appropriate lengths of the conductors {{to be used in the}} full-scale CS coils under relevant conditions. The ITER Program plans to build and test a CSI to verify the performance of the CS conductor. The CSI is a one-layer solenoid with an inner diameter of 1. 48 m and a height of 4. 45 m between electric terminal ends. The coil weight with the terminals is approximately 820 kg without insulation. The major goal of the CSI is to measure the temperature margin of the CS under the ITER direct current (DC) operating conditions, including determining sensitivity to load cycles. Performance of the joints, ramp rate sensitivity, and stability against thermal or electromagnetic disturbances, electrical insulation, losses, and instrumentation are addressed separately and therefore are not major goals in this project. However, losses and joint performance will be tested during the CSI testing campaign. The USIPO will build the CSI that will be tested at the <b>Central</b> <b>Solenoid</b> Model <b>Coil</b> (CSMC) Test Facility at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), Naka, Japan. The industrial vendors (the Suppliers) will report to the USIPO (the Company). All approvals to proceed will be issued by the Company, which in some cases, as specified in this document, will also require the approval of the ITER Organization. Responsibilities and obligations will be covered by respective contracts between the USIPO, called Company interchangeably, and the industrial Prime Contractors, called Suppliers. Different stages of work may be performed by more than one Prime Contractor, as described in this specification. Technical requirements of the contract between the Company and the Prime Contractor will be covered by the Fabrication Specifications developed by the Prime Contractor based on this document and approved by the Company and ITER. The Fabrication Specifications may reflect some national requirements and regulations that are not fully provided here. This document presents the ITER CSI specifications...|$|R
40|$|The ATLAS <b>central</b> <b>solenoid</b> magnet {{is being}} {{constructed}} {{to provide a}} magnetic field of 2 Tesla in the central tracking part of the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Since the <b>solenoid</b> <b>coil</b> is {{placed in front of}} the liquid-argon electromagnetic calorimeter, the <b>solenoid</b> <b>coil</b> must be as thin (and transparent) as possible. The high-strength and high- RRR aluminum-stabilized superconductor is a key technology for the solenoid to be thinnest while keeping its stability. This has been developed with an alloy of 0. 1 wt% nickel addition to 5 N pure aluminum and with the subsequent mechanical cold working of 21 % in area reduction. A yield strength of 110 MPa at 4. 2 K has been realized keeping a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of 590, after a heat treatment corresponding to coil curing at 130 degrees C for 15 hrs. This paper describes the optimization of the fabrication process and characteristics of the developed conductor. (8 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{results on the}} International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) <b>Central</b> <b>Solenoid</b> Model <b>Coil</b> and Insert Coil {{have shown that the}} critical characteristics measured on a single strand are significantly different from those of a cabled conductor. This performance degradation seems to be due mostly to the bending effects on the strands subjected to the electromagnetic forces: a strand inside the cable behaves like a beam supported by the neighbouring strands and loaded by the transversal Lorentz force. Recently at the University of Twente (The Netherlands) and at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) some experimental tests have been performed to study this effect. In this study we analyze the strand strain field resulting from the cool down and the successive bending loads. Due to the material non linearity {{it is not possible to}} calculate the two effects separately. To analyze the strain field in a strand experiencing an electromagnetic load at 4. 2 K, it is hence necessary to follow the evolution of the deformation from the strand reaction temperature to its working conditions. One single strand is taken into consideration, and it is studied with three different approaches: assuming Kirchhoff hypothesis, applying Timoshenko beam theory and using a composite, fibrous beam model. The resulting strain field is used as input data for the THELMA code to compare the results with the experiment performed at JAERI. This work is detailed in a companion paper...|$|R
