25|$|Specialty {{pharmacies}} supply {{high cost}} injectable, oral, infused, or inhaled medications {{that are used}} for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike a traditional <b>community</b> <b>pharmacy</b> where prescriptions for any common medication can be brought in and filled, specialty pharmacies carry novel medications {{that need to be}} properly stored, administered, carefully monitored, and clinically managed. In addition to supplying these drugs, specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs. It is currently the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly FDA approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs.|$|E
25|$|The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is {{a central}} {{component}} of the Australian healthcare system. The scheme provides reimbursement to <b>community</b> <b>pharmacy</b> for the costs of dispensing prescription medicines prescribed {{in accordance with the}} PBS Schedule, a comprehensive but closed formulary. Drugs are added to the formulary on the basis of an assessment of comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness compared to the therapy most likely to be replaced in practice. The result is that where {{there is no evidence of}} incremental benefit, a drug may not be listed at a higher price than the comparator with the result that for many (but by no means all) drugs the prices for subsidy purposes are a great deal cheaper than in many other major markets.|$|E

40|$|Background: Patients {{with mental}} disorders, such as {{depression}} and anxiety, who seek medical care in private psychiatric clinics in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, have recently expressed concerns to doctors about difficulty in filling psychotropic medications, such as Amitriptyline and Aripiprazole, at retail <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies.</b> Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether there is a shortage of some commonly prescribed psychotropic medications in retail <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> in Saudi Arabia, and if so, to explore the possible reasons behind the shortage of these medications. Methods: The availability of 28 commonly prescribed psychotropic medications was checked in multiple retail <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> in 4 different regions of Saudi Arabia. Further, potential reasons behind the shortage of some psychotropic medications in retail <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> were also explored. Results: Amitriptyline, Amoxapine, Aripiprazole, Bupropion, Buspirone, Duloxetine, Haloperidol, Hydroxyzine, Lithium, Prochlorperazine, Procyclidine, Promethazine, Thioridazine, Trazodone, and Trifluoperazine were unavailable in over half of the 248 <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> surveyed. Four possible reasons behind the shortage of these medications were reported by 31 pharmacists working in different retail community pharmacies’ purchasing departments, with a majority (58. 06 %) reporting the primary reason for a shortage of these medications that they are slow-moving items with low profit margins. Conclusions: The findings of this study should expedite the reform process in both the Ministry of Health and the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) to publish and enforce an essential list of medications for retail <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> which should include the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medications...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Under {{reporting}} of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by healthcare personnel {{is a common}} problem of many Pharmacovigilence programs. Lack of involvement of healthcare professionals such as pharmacists and other pharmaceutical dispensers has been cited {{as one of the}} reasons for under reporting. Pharmaceutical dispensers in the <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> are in unique position by virtue of their training and profession to observe ADRs in patients, as many patients often try to avoid doctor consultation fees by visiting <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies.</b> The knowledge and ability of dispensers in Tanzanian <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> to identify and report ADRs is however unknown. Study objective: To determine the knowledge, attitude and practices of dispensers in <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> in Dar es Salaam towards the ADRs reporting. Methodology: A descriptive cross sectional survey was conducted involving 254 dispensers from selected retail pharmacies in Dar es Salaam region. SPSS version 16 was used for data entry, cleaning and subsequently analysis. Results: The majority of personnel working in <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> are non pharmaceutical professionals i. e 52 % were nurse assistants. Community dispensers have limited knowledge and practices with regard towards ADRs reporting. Only 13. 8 % of respondents had good ADRs reporting knowledge, while only 8. 7 % had ever submitted ADRs reports to the relevant authorities. There was a significant difference in the level of knowledge with regard to ADRs reporting between Pharmaceutical professionals (i. e Pharmacists, Pharmaceutical technicians and pharmaceutical assistants) and non Pharmaceutical professionals (P value = 0. 000). The knowledge levels correlated positively with profession and attendance of continuous professional education courses (CPE). The majority of dispensers (68. 9 %) however had a positive attitude towards ADRs reporting. Conclusion and Recommendations: <b>Community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> dispensers in Dar es Salaam have limited knowledge and experience with regard to ADRs reporting. Thus <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> in Dar es Salaam cannot presently act as centres to collect data on ADRs effectively. The staffing of <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> with unqualified pharmaceutical professionals is the main reason for the lack of knowledge, thus sincere and sustained efforts should be made by the Government through its National Regulatory Authorities and Schools of Pharmaceutical Sciences to ensure that there is an increased output of vii pharmaceutical professionals in Tanzania, ADRs reporting forms and guidelines are available in <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> and that continuous professional education is provided to in-service pharmaceutical professionals to improve their ADRs reporting capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{document}} the case management of uncomplicated malaria fever at <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> {{located in the}} two major cities of Pakistan; Islamabad (national capital) and Rawalpindi (twin city). Method: A comparative, cross-sectional {{study was designed to}} {{document the}} management of uncomplicated malaria fever at <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> in twin cities of Pakistan through simulated patient visits. Visits were conducted in 238 randomly selected pharmacies to request advice for a simulated patient case of malaria. The pharmacy’s management was scored on a checklist including history taking and provision of advice and information. Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare management of uncomplicated malaria fever by different types of dispensers working at <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> situated at different locations in the twin cities. Results: The simulated patients were handled by salesmen (74. 8 %, n= 178), pharmacist (5. 4 %, n= 13) and diploma holders (19. 8 %, n= 47). Medication was dispensed in 83. 1 % (n= 198) of the visits, but only few of the treated cases were in accordance to standard treatment guidelines for malaria. However, in 14. 8 % (n= 35) of the cases the simulated patients were directly referred to a physician. There was a significant difference observed in the process of history taking performed by different dispensers (e. g. pharmacist, pharmacy assistant, pharmacy diploma holders and salesman) while no significant differences in the provision of advice by these dispensers was observed. Pharmacists were seen more frequently involved in the process of history taking if available at the <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies.</b> On the other hand, no significant differences were observed in the case management (history taking and provision of advice) for the treatment of malaria fever among <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> situated at different locations (e. g. near hospital/super market/small market) in the twin cities. Conclusion: The results of the study revealed that the overall process of disease management of uncomplicated malaria fever at <b>community</b> <b>pharmacies</b> was not in accordance with the national standard treatment guidelines for malaria.
