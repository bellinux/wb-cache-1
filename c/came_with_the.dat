5|$|Although {{there are}} no major flood control dams on Aliso Creek itself, there are 19drop {{structures}}, and while doing nothing to reduce the creek's rainy season surges, the drop structures were constructed to mitigate the catastrophic erosion that <b>came</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> creek's increased flow. Although the creek has a wide floodplain throughout most of Aliso Canyon, a major bottleneck lies {{at the south end}} of the canyon where a sharp bend in the creek is constricted between crowded development and steep cliffs. In flooding events, this area generally sustains heavy damage.|$|E
5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World <b>came</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused {{and supported the}} ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same}} time supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{did little}} {{business}} in the transfer market {{early in the season}} due to the financial demands that <b>came</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> club's new stadium project. The main addition to the first team was goalkeeper Jens Lehmann for £1.5million; striker José Antonio Reyes was later purchased in the winter transfer window. Arsenal retained their best players and successfully negotiated new contracts for captain Patrick Vieira and midfielder Robert Pirès. The stability of the squad meant Arsenal were considered front-runners for the Premier League title, along with Manchester United, and Chelsea who were taken over by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{his attempt}} to balance the budget, Corzine {{decreased}} funding to most programs and localities including state universities and colleges. The first of these decreases <b>came</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 2007 budget. Rutgers University and other New Jersey state universities have raised tuition, cut hundreds of sections of classes, and several sports teams. With the latest decrease in funding for 2009, most state institutions have less funding than they had a decade ago. Despite the $15 million in cuts, Rutgers went ahead with previous agreed upon raises of $15 million to their executive faculty. This resulted in Rutgers making $30 million in cuts.|$|E

Blue Shift had relatively little new content compared to Opposing Force: aside from a few variations on existing models, all content was already present in the original Half-Life.|$|E

5|$|Historically part of Cheshire, Altrincham was {{established}} as a market town in 1290, {{a time when the}} economy of most communities was based on agriculture rather than trade, and there is still a market in the town today. Further socioeconomic development <b>came</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 and the arrival of the railway in 1849, stimulating industrial activity in the town. Outlying villages were absorbed by Altrincham's subsequent growth, along with the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall, formerly the home of the Earl of Stamford, and now a tourist attraction with three Grade I Listed Buildings and a deer park.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{played only}} three {{seasons with the}} 49ers. Like Tittle, Johnson had a late-blooming career; his most {{productive}} years <b>came</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pittsburgh Steelers, well after his time in San Francisco. He remains the oldest player to rush for 1,000 yards in a single season, when he did so in 1964 at age 35. He retired in 1966 with the third most career rushing yards in the NFL. Johnson's induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame came in 1987, and was an honor that contemporaries felt was fifteen years overdue.|$|E

5|$|King of Pop is a {{compilation}} album by American recording artist Michael Jackson released in commemoration of Michael Jackson's 50th birthday.

5|$|Religious peace <b>came</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{emergence}} of the Macedonian dynasty in 867, {{as well as a}} strong and unified Byzantine leadership; while the Abassid empire had splintered into many factions after 861.

Basil allied with the Holy Roman Emperor Louis II against the Arabs, and his fleet cleared the Adriatic Sea of their raids.|$|E
