40|$|Worldwide, {{we rely on}} {{introduced}} {{plants for}} the essentials of human life; however, intentional plant introductions for commercial benefit have resulted in invaders with negative environmental, economic or social impacts. We argue that plant species of low expected economic value should be less acceptable for introduction than species of high economic value if their other traits are similar; however, key traits such as likelihood of escape and costs of escape are often highly uncertain. Methods do not currently exist which allow decision makers to evaluate {{costs and benefits of}} introduction under uncertainty. We developed a cost-benefit analysis for determining plant introduction that incorporates probability of escape, expected economic costs after escape, expected commercial benefits, and the efficiency and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>containment.</b> We used a model to obtain optimal decisions for the introduction and containment of commercial plants while maximizing net benefit or avoiding losses. We also obtained conditions for robust decisions which take into account severe uncertainty in model parameters using information-gap decision theory. Optimal decisions for introduction and containment of commercial plants depended, not only on the probability of escape and subsequent costs incurred, but also on the anticipated commercial benefit, and the cost and efficiency of containment. When our objective is to maximize net benefit, increasing uncertainty in parameter values increased the likelihood of introduction; in contrast, if our objective is to avoid losses, more uncertainty decreased the likelihood of introduction...|$|E

40|$|The {{search for}} optimal phase change {{materials}} (PCMs) for latent heat {{thermal energy storage}} systems (LHTESS) focuses almost exclusively on {{the properties of the}} PCM. This neglects the significant contribution <b>of</b> the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the <b>containment</b> vessel on the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the LHTESS. Thus, to accurately assess the thermoeconomic performance of various PCMs, the relationship between the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the <b>containment</b> vessel and the properties of the PCM must be understood. This paper presents an analytical method for optimizing the design of tube and shell or tube and fin containment vessels for the least cost, subject to geometric and performance constraints. One of the key performance constraints is the time to charge, whose evaluation typically requires computationally-expensive simulations which are unsuitable for optimization algorithms. To enable efficient optimization, a novel closed-form approximation of the charge time is developed and validated through numerical simulations. Subsequently, the optimization methodology is used to investigate the relationship between the optimal vessel geometry and configuration, fin properties, PCM properties, and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> two PCMs. For these PCMs, the use of high thermal conductivity fins is shown to dramatically reduce the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the system. The new methodology is an efficient way to compare the thermoeconomic performance of PCMs as latent heat storage solutions, allowing for the accurate assessment of PCMs. Keywords PCM heat exchanger design; Latent heat thermal energy storage system optimization; Phase change material; Thermal energy storag...|$|R

40|$|Originally part of {{the private}} domain of families, care of the older people is now the concern of public policy. Yet, in the European context <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>containment,</b> {{it is not easy}} to make a case for {{increasing}} public support and the caring function of families remains prominent in social policy. In this paper, the authors question public policies around care of the older people in relation to both the needs of old people, but also those of adult children, mainly women, who work and provide care for their old parents. We investigate the interactions between public support in long-term care and the caring function of families. The paper presents some results of a comparative research study based on the identification of the policy measures which have been implemented in different European countries in the sector of care of the older people, and on the detailed analysis of care arrangements set up by a sample of 86 family carers in these various national contexts. We argue that in a context <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>containment,</b> whatever the usual patterns of care and the role given to the family and public authorities, the policy measures which have been introduced since the 90 s aim to support family carers in various ways with the common objective of giving them the flexibility they need in the organisation of care arrangements, combining various resources (formal professional care, unpaid informal care, semi-formal care).

40|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies linking {{psychological}} distress with the demand for medical care. The importance of these studies lies in the finding that the distressed use of services more frequently than the non-distressed. To the extent that many of the visits of the distressed are for medically trivial reasons, which is the most frequent interpretation of this finding, there may be an argument in favor <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>containment</b> strategies aimed at diverting the distressed away from seeking 'unneeded' medical attention. There are, however, a number of difficulties both with most of the studies that have been done to date and with how the finding of more frequent visits among the distressed is interpreted. The present study examines the reporting of illnesses, disability per illness reported, patient initiated physician visits per illness reported and physicians' judgement regarding the medical necessity of the visits reported for a representative sample of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The 950 respondents in this analysis were divided into groups by three levels of psychological distress. Illnesses reported both prospectively and retrospectively to the measurement of psychological distress are analyzed. The data indicate that, although the distressed report more illnesses, they are no more likely either to report disability per illness or to initiate medical care per illness. Further, the distressed are no more likely either to initiate unnecessary physician visits or to avoid initiating necessary visits. The implications of these findings for the impact <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>containment</b> strategies on equity in the delivery of medical services are discussed. psychological distress care seeking illness reporting...|$|R
