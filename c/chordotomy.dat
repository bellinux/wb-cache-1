50|$|Cordotomy (or <b>chordotomy)</b> is a {{surgical}} procedure that disables selected pain-conducting tracts in the spinal cord, {{in order to}} achieve loss of pain and temperature perception. This procedure is commonly performed on patients experiencing severe pain due to cancer or other incurable diseases. Anterolateral cordotomy is effective for relieving unilateral, somatic pain while bilateral cordotomies may be required for visceral or bilateral pain.|$|E
50|$|Since {{there is}} a variety of classifications of winged scapula, {{there is a}}lso more than one type of treatment. Massage Therapy is an {{effective}} initial approach to relax the damaged muscles. In more severe cases, Physical Therapy can help by strengthening effected and surrounding muscles. Physical therapy constitutes treatment options if there is weakness of the glenohumeral joint muscles, but if the muscles do not contract clinically and symptoms continue to be severe for more than 3-6 months, surgery may be the next choice. Surgery by fixation of the scapula to the rib cage can be done for those with isolated scapular winging. Some options are neurolysis (<b>chordotomy),</b> intercostal nerve transfer, scapulothoracic fusion, arthrodesis (scapulodesis), or scapulothoracis fixation without arthrodesis (scapulopexy).|$|E
40|$|Four Macaca nemestrina monkeys {{were trained}} to pull a manipulandum to escape electrocutaneou {{stimulation}} (ES) applied to either leg. The intensities of stimulation which the monkeys chose to escape were those that humans identify as painful. The duration of escape trials was inversely related to stimulus intensity, and the force of escape responses was directly related to ES intensity. Reflexive responses were elicited by stimulus intensities below and above the escape threshold, and {{the force of the}} flexion reflexes was a negatively accelerating function of stimulus magnitude. The monkeys were also trained to respond, for water reinforcement, to cued, low-intensity ES. The stimulus intensities detected for water reinforcement were SO- 100 x less than the escape thresholds. Following unilateral, anterolateral <b>chordotomy,</b> all monkeys demonstrated a large reduction in percentage of escape respondin...|$|E
