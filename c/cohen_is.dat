500|$|The Kirkus Reviews {{described}} Middlesex as a [...] "virtuosic {{combination of}} elegy, sociohistorical study, and picaresque adventure", and Adam Begley in the New York Observer called it [...] "a hybrid form, epic crossed with history, romance, comedy, tragedy." [...] Other reviews also categorized the book under various genres. Covering {{the lives of}} three generations of the Stephanides family, Middlesex is considered a family saga by novelist Geraldine Bedell.
