Pinning the man with a sabre, Williams took him into custody. The other suspected mutineers were also captured.|$|E
5|$|After the {{violence}} of November 4, the Indianapolis Merchant's Association and other business leaders petitioned Governor Ralston to <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Indiana National Guard. Members of both parties accused the union leaders of trying to prevent their voters from reaching the polls. The riots made national news and public leaders began to consider them an embarrassment to the state. Union leaders informed the Governor that calling out the guard would only cause them to escalate the riot and lead to more bloodshed.|$|E

Schneider also makes reference to Colbert's grudge against The Decemberists (whose guitarist, Chris Funk, appeared in the same episode of the show) with the lines [...] "he's <b>calling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> bears in their evil lairs/he's <b>calling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> press in their fancy dress/he's <b>calling</b> <b>out</b> <b>The</b> Decemberists and their Green Screen Contest".|$|R

He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set {{on the left side}} of the instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, the {{legislature}} {{passed a resolution}} instructing Magoffin to order the Confederate forces (but not the Union forces) to leave the state. The Governor vetoed the resolution, but the General Assembly overrode his veto, and Magoffin gave the order. The next week, the assembly officially requested {{the assistance of the}} Union and asked the governor to <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> state militia to join the Federal forces. Magoffin also vetoed this request. Again the assembly overrode his veto and Magoffin acquiesced.|$|E
5|$|Outraged by {{news of the}} defeat, Washington urged Congress {{to raise}} an army capable of {{conducting}} a successful offense against the Indian confederacy, which it did in March 1792establishing additional Army regiments (the Legion of the United States), adding three-year enlistments, and increasing military pay. The following month the House of Representatives conducted investigative hearings into the debacle. This was the first Special Congressional investigation under the federal Constitution. Afterward, Congress passed two Militia Acts: the first empowered the president to <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> militias of the several states; the second required that every free able-bodied white male citizen of the various states, {{between the ages of}} 18 and 45, enroll in the militia of the state in which they reside.|$|E

5|$|Parties in {{opposition}} to Alcalá-Zamora's government gained {{the support of the}} church and the military. The head of the church in Spain, Cardinal Pedro Segura, was particularly vocal in his disapproval. Until the 20th century, the Catholic Church had proved an essential part of Spain's character, although it had internal problems. Segura was expelled from Spain in June 1931. This prompted an outcry from the Catholic right, who cited oppression. A series of church-burning incidents occurred in major Spanish cities throughout May 1931. When the government refused to <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Guardia Civil, Minister for War Manuel Azaña came under heavy criticism from the rightist press. The military were opposed to reorganisation, including an increase in regional autonomy granted by the central government, and reforms to improve efficiency were seen as a direct attack. Officers were retired and a thousand had their promotions reviewed, including Francisco Franco, who served as director of the General Military Academy in Zaragoza, which was closed by Manuel Azaña.|$|E
5|$|The Indiana National Guard was federalized during WWI; many {{units were}} sent to Europe. A {{separate}} organization, the Liberty Guard, had been formed in 1910, primarily for social purposes: members marched in parades and at patriotic events. Governor Samuel Ralston had to <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Liberty Guard in November 1913 to put down a growing workers strike in Indianapolis. By 1920, the state decided to formalize this group, renaming it the Indiana Civil Defense Force and supplying it with equipment and training. In 1941, the unit was named the Indiana Guard Reserve; it effectively became a state militia. During World War II, it was again federalized and members were called up by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years later}} Commodore Charles Knowles, {{who served as}} Governor of Louisbourg after its capture, had {{a large number of}} seamen from Boston harbour {{impressed}} for service in his squadron. A mob of more than 300 men seized three naval officers and a deputy sheriff and beat the sheriff. The mob then went to Governor Shirley's house, demanding the release of the men impressed by Knowles. Shirley tried to <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> militia, but they did not respond. Shirley did succeed in getting the naval officers into his house, and the mob eventually left. Later in the day Shirley went to the Town House to meet the people. The mob, now consisting of several thousand people, attacked the Town House, breaking many windows in the building. Shirley spoke to the mob and promised to present their demands to Commodore Knowles. The mob left, intending to find a Royal Navy ship to burn.|$|E

5|$|The 1845 {{legislature}} met {{three different}} times, under two different structures. First, from June 24 to July 5, 1845, the legislature met in Oregon City, {{first at the}} home of John E. Long and then the home of Theophilus R. Magruder, with Morton M. McCarver serving as the speaker of the group. After this, the Organic Laws were replaced with the Organic Act of 1845, which altered the legislature in several ways. First the number of representatives was increased to include a minimum of 13 and a maximum of 61. Second, the name was changed to the House of Representatives. All members of the body were to be elected by popular vote with vacancies filled using special elections. The body also received new powers to impeach any civil official by a 3/4ths vote, apportion the legislators among the districts, create post offices, levy taxes, declare war, organize and <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> militia, create lower courts, pass laws concerning the general welfare of the region, regulate trade with the Native Americans, regulate liquor sale and manufacture, and regulate the police power of the government, among other powers.
