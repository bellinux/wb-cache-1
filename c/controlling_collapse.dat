40|$|Collapse in gypsum terrains is {{a serious}} {{geological}} hazard and can damage engineering structures, settlement areas, natural lakes, and allow infiltration of contaminants into the groundwater. Presentation of engineering geological data {{in the form of}} a hazard map is a useful tool in urban planning. To avoid the problems and thus save property and money, detailed geoscientific data should be collected and used in urban planing. Interpretation of future collapse occurrence requires an understanding of conditions and processes <b>controlling</b> <b>collapse</b> events. To predict collapse, it is necessary to assume that collapse occurrence is determined by collapse-related factors, and that future collapses are likely to occur under the same conditions as past collapses. In this study, collapse hazard was reviewed and a method was presented for collapse susceptibility mapping in gypsum terrain in of Sivas basin (Turkey) using a statistical method (conditional probability) ...|$|E
40|$|Migration is a complex, dynamic {{process that}} has largely been studied using {{qualitative}} or static approaches. As technology has improved, we can now take quantitative approaches towards understanding cell migration using in vivo imaging and tracking analyses. In this manner, we have established a four-step model of mesoderm migration during Drosophila gastrulation: (I) mesodermal tube formation, (II) collapse of the mesoderm, (III) dorsal migration and spreading and (IV) monolayer formation. Our data provide evidence that these steps are temporally distinct and that each might require different chemical inputs. To support this, we analyzed the role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, in particular the function of two Drosophila FGF ligands, Pyramus and Thisbe, during mesoderm migration. We determined that FGF signaling through both ligands controls movements in the radial direction. Thisbe {{is required for the}} initial collapse of the mesoderm onto the ectoderm, whereas both Pyramus and Thisbe are required for monolayer formation. In addition, we uncovered that the GTPase Rap 1 regulates radial movement of cells and localization of the beta-integrin subunit, Myospheroid, which is also required for monolayer formation. Our analyses suggest that distinct signals influence particular movements, as we found that FGF signaling is involved in <b>controlling</b> <b>collapse</b> and monolayer formation but not dorsal movement, whereas integrins are required to support monolayer formation only and not earlier movements. Our work demonstrates that complex cell migration is not necessarily a fluid process, but suggests instead that different types of movements are directed by distinct inputs in a stepwise manner...|$|E
40|$|DE 19904030 C UPAB: 20001023 NOVELTY - The lengthy body (10) of {{the section}} {{comprises}} metallic foam, with a casing (20) of fiber reinforced plastic. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the method of making the energy-absorbing section. The foam body is made first, in the desired shape. The matrix and inlaid fibers are then wound on. Preferred features: The fiber-reinforced plastic casing fits precisely around the cylindrical body. Glass fiber reinforced plastic (GRP) is employed, as several wound layers (21, 22, 23). At least one is wound circumferentially at 90 deg. plus or minus 10 deg.. The innermost winding is annular. A winding outside it is at plus or minus 45 deg.. This {{is surrounded by a}} third outer annular winding. A variant of this structure is described. USE - An energy-absorbing section, especially useful for automobile construction. ADVANTAGE - The modern compact car has less bodywork to crumple in a crash, fostering a requirement for separate energy absorption units. The new assembly described supplies this need, and is particularly lightweight, accommodating a parallel trend. It absorbs energy like a steel section, but takes up less space. The structure described, controls collapse predictably. Localized energy absorption is feasible, contrast the situation with bodywork which is effective in a head-on collision, but not in an off-axis impact. Whilst the casing is thin, it has an important function in <b>controlling</b> <b>collapse.</b> The foam would readily break up, if not encased. Loads resisted, exceed the sum of loads supported by casing and foam alone, a synergistic effect. Optimal structure for energy absorption is further discussed in the disclosure. The winding process described, is ideal for automation...|$|E

40|$|This text {{presents}} a numerical and theoretical study of multistability in two stochastic models of transitional wall flows. An algorithm {{dedicated to the}} computation of rare events is adapted on these two stochastic models. The main focus is placed on a Stochastic Partial Differential Equation model proposed by Barkley. Three types of events are computed in a systematic and reproducible manner: (i) the collapse of isolated puffs and domains initially containing their steady turbulent fraction, (ii) the puff splitting, (iii) the build up of turbulence from the laminar baseflow under a noise perturbation of vanishing variance. For build up events, an extreme realisation of the vanishing variance noise pushes the state from the laminar baseflow to the most probable germ of turbulence which in turn develops into a full blown puff. For collapse events, the Reynolds number and length ranges of the two regimes of collapse of laminar-turbulent pipes: independent collapse or global collapse of puffs, is determined. The mean first passage time before each event is then systematically computed {{as a function of}} the Reynolds number r and pipe length L in the laminar-turbulent coexistence range of Reynolds number. In the case of isolated puffs, the faster-than-linear growth with Reynolds number of the logarithm of mean first passage time T before collapse is separated in two. One finds that ln(T) = Ap × r − Bp, with Ap and Bp positive. Moreover, Ap and Bp are affine in the spatial integral of turbulence intensity of the puff, with the same slope. In the case of pipes initially containing the steady turbulent fraction, the length L and Reynolds number r dependence of the mean first passage time T before collapse is also separated. We find that T ≍ exp(L(Ar − B)) with A and B positive. The length and Reynolds number dependence of T are then discussed in view of the Large Deviations theoretical approaches of the study of mean first passage times and multistability, where we study ln(T) in the limit of small variance noise. Two points of view, local noise of small variance and large length, can be used to discuss the exponential dependence in L of T. In particular, it is shown how a T ≍ exp(L(A ′ R − B ′)) can be derived in a conceptual two degrees of freedom model of a transitional wall flow proposed by Dauchot & Manneville. This is done by identifying a quasipotential in low variance noise, large length limit. This pinpoints the physical effects <b>controlling</b> <b>collapse</b> and build up trajectories and corresponding passage times with an emphasis on the saddle points between laminar and turbulent states. This analytical analysis also shows that these effects lead to the asymmetric probability density function of kinetic energy of turbulence...|$|E
40|$|Collapse calderas {{are defined}} as the {{volcanic}} depression that result from the disruption of the geometry of the magma chamber roof due to down faulting {{during the course of}} an eruption. These structures have received considerable attention due to their link to Earth's ore deposits and geothermal energy resources, but also because large pyroclastic eruptions and associated caldera collapse structures represent one of the most catastrophic geologic events that have occurred on the Earth's surface in the Phanerozoic time and in the historical time. After several pioneering works, collapse calderas {{have been the subject of}} studies of diverse disciplines. However, some important aspects on caldera dynamics and structure remain poorly understood yet. First, we have revised important works concerning field data about collapse calderas and summarized the most relevant aspects and results. We have created a database to record existing information about collapse calderas: Collapse Caldera DataBase (CCDB). After an exhaustive analysis of the included information we have observed two types of collapse caldera: type-A and type-B. Experiments on caldera collapse modelling allow a qualitative study of the structural evolution of a caldera collapse process and suggest which of factors play a more relevant role. Analogue models have verified that caldera collapse formation is influenced by multiple aspects (e. g. regional tectonics). We have performed three types of semi-quantitative analyses of particular interest for volcanic hazard: the measurement of the erupted magma chamber volume fraction required to achieve each step of the collapse process, the estimation of the subsidence pattern and the study of the influence of the roof aspect ratio in the dimensions of the collapse parts at surface. This work includes also a summary of the most important aspects concerning mathematical models of collapse calderas. In base of a mathematical analysis of the pressure evolution inside the chamber during volcanic cycles, we have defined two collapse caldera end-members: under- and overpressure calderas. We have (1) reproduced numerically some of the analogue experiments set out in this work; (2) studied the influence of the selected geometrical setting (e. g. axial symmetric or three-dimensional) in the obtained results and subsequent interpretations and (3) demonstrated that results obtained with mathematical models not strictly related to collapse caldera processes are also applicable to the study of collapse mechanisms and controlling factors. Finally, we compare the different results obtained by the three distinct disciplines, in order to propose a genetic classification for collapse calderas and to describe the dynamic and structural evolution of the defined end-members. We distinguish between "Cordilleran type" and "Composite volcano type" calderas. Calderas related to the first group correspond to commonly rhyolitic or dacitic, large plate/piston or trap-door calderas formed from a sill-like overpressurized magma chamber in the presence of a regional extensive stress field and a large scale doming or underplating. These calderas tend to occur in areas of thick or thin continental crust and in evolved transitional thick crust. They are associated with C-type subduction zones and areas of continental rifting. "Composite volcano type" calderas occur at the culmination of a long eruptive cycle in composite volcanoes. They take place at the summit of a long-lived volcanic edifice, which has undergone various periods of magma chamber inflation and deflation and different eruptions. The caldera-forming eruption begins with overpressure inside the chamber that triggers, once overcome the tensile strength of the host rock, magma injection into the host rock and finally, an eruption. Calderas included in this group tend to be smaller and not too voluminous. Concluding, the combination of field studies with experimental and theoretical/mathematical and modelling allows us to identify and quantify the main factors <b>controlling</b> <b>collapse</b> calderas...|$|E
