5000|$|Demodex bovis, {{also known}} as the <b>cattle</b> <b>follicle</b> <b>mite,</b> usually causes demodicosis, or demodectic mange, in cattle. This disease is common in {{tropical}} areas and is not usually found in temperate environments. [...] Demodicosis is characterized by the formation of papules and nodules over the cattle's skin. These lesions most commonly occur on the neck, shoulders, and armpit of cattle; however, sometimes they also appear on the udder. This condition is often found in cattle with increased stress from pregnancy or lactation. Natural and acquired immunity can cause a {{decrease in the number of}} mites infesting a cow as well as decreasing the severity of a cow's symptoms.|$|E

40|$|Summary We {{present a}} 35 -year-old patient with {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome who had demodici-dosis on his face, characterized by multiple papules and papulopustules, associated pruritus, numerous mites on skin-surface biopsy and in biopsy specimens, and rapid response to topical treatment with permethrin. It seems likely that Demodex infestation does not manifest unless local or systemic immune function is altered, leading to the proliferation of the organism and subsequent disease. Key words: {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}}, Demodex folliculitis, Demodex mites, demodici-dosis, rosacea-like dermatosis The hair <b>follicle</b> <b>mites</b> Demodex folliculorum and D. brevis are common inhabitants of the human pilosebaceous unit. 1 D. folliculorum is more common than D. brevis and {{is characterized by a}} larger size, an elongated posterior segment, and arrowhead-shaped eggs. It is usually located in the follicular infundibulum and may be present in numbers up to 10 ± 15 per follicle. I...|$|R
50|$|The adult mites {{are only}} 0.3 - 0.4 mm long, with D. brevis {{slightly}} shorter than D. folliculorum. Each has a semitransparent, elongated body {{that consists of}} two fused segments. Eight short, segmented legs {{are attached to the}} first body segment. The body is covered with scales for anchoring itself in the hair <b>follicle,</b> and the <b>mite</b> has pin-like mouthparts for eating skin cells and oils (sebum) which accumulate in the hair <b>follicles.</b> The <b>mites</b> can leave the hair follicles and slowly walk around on the skin, at a speed of 8 - 16 cm per hour, especially at night, as they try to avoid light. The mites are transferred between hosts through contact with hair, eyebrows, and the sebaceous glands of the face.|$|R
5000|$|Demodicosis {{occurs when}} female mites lay eggs in hair {{follicle}}s. Each follicle may contain {{hundreds or thousands}} of mites, which leads to the formation of skin papules and nodules. These papules and nodules, or bumps beneath the skin, can be felt even before they can be seen. [...] Typically, the papules and nodules last for a month and then are replaced with new ones. They typically are found in the greatest numbers during spring and summer months. Their size can range from as small as a pinhead to as large as a chicken egg. The larger ones are formed when the cysts grow in size, forming granulomatous nodules, characterized by the blocking of the opening of the <b>follicle</b> by <b>mites,</b> keratin, and other remnants. These large cysts can burst, which causes open wounds to form. The thick pus-like substance that comes out of these sores contains Demodex bovis, which can be spread to other animals. Another way mites can be spread is when female <b>mites</b> leave the <b>follicle</b> they are in and go lay eggs in a new follicle. This form of transfer can spread the condition to different follicles on an already infected cow as well as to other cows and animals through copulation or other physical contact. For instance, mites may be transmitted to calves within a few days of nursing, when the shoulders and hips of calves contact the infected mother.|$|R
50|$|One genus of mites, Demodex, has {{adapted to}} infesting the hair follicles of its hosts. These mites remain {{external}} to the true outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) which also lines the tube of the hair <b>follicle.</b> However, the <b>mites</b> appear to be deep within the skin {{in the sense of}} being below the general outer surface of the host. The mites fit in the narrow space between the hair and the tube of the follicle. They may also crawl out onto the general epidermal surface of their host. Transmission of these mites from host to host occurs during close contact when young animals are suckled. Demodex mites are morphologically adapted to this constricted habitat: microscopic, worm shaped, and with very short legs. The mites feed on cells of the epidermal lining of the hair follicle. Many species of mammals, including humans, are readily infested with these mites, but typically the density of infestation is very low. However they are considered parasitic in people with weakened immune systems.|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies using}} transrectal ovarian {{ultrasonic}} scanning in Bos taurus (B. taurus) cattle {{and more recently}} in Bos indicus (B. Indicus) females evaluated the reproductive cycles of heifers and cows under different conditions. In general, B. indicus <b>cattle</b> have more <b>follicles</b> and more follicular waves during the estrous cycle and ovulate from smaller follicles than B. taurus. Consequently B. indicus females have smaller corpora lutea and it is assumed circulating concentrations of estradiol and progesterone are also less. However, these findings may {{vary depending on the}} nutritional status and regimen in which the animals are managed. Moreover, there are significant differences between B. taurus and B. indicus regarding follicle size at the time of deviation of the dominant follicle. These differences in ovarian function between B. indicus and B. taurus, e. g. greater antral follicle population are, probably, the main reasons for the great success of in vitro embryo production programs in Zebu cattle, especially in Brazil.

40|$|Although the deiscovery that follicles in bovine ovaries grow in a wave-like fashion has {{presented}} challenges for estrus synchronization and superovulation, recent protocols, designed to control follicular function have permitted fixed-time AI or fixed-time embryo transfer with high pregnancy rates, and {{the initiation of}} superstimulatory treatments at a self-appoinnted time, al without the necessity of estrus detection. The key is the synchronization of follicle wave emergence. More recent studies have revealed that in {{is not possible to}} synchronize the timing of ovulation for fixed-time AI in single ovulating animals, but also in superstimulated donors. Ultrasound-guided follicle ablation is very efficacious in synchronizing follicle wave emergence but is difficult to apply in the field. Similarly, the induction of ovulation with GnRH or LH will effectively synchronize follicle wave emergence, but ovulation occurs in only 60 to 70 % of cases.

40|$|Background At {{later stages}} of folliculogenesis, the {{mammalian}} ovarian follicle contains layers of epithelial granulosa cells surrounding an antral cavity. During follicle development granulosa cells replicate, secrete hormones {{and support the}} growth of the oocyte. In <b>cattle,</b> the <b>follicle</b> needs to grow?>? 10 mm in diameter to allow an oocyte to ovulate, following which the granulosa cells cease dividing and differentiate into the specialised cells of the corpus luteum. To better understand the molecular basis of follicular growth and granulosa cell maturation, we undertook transcriptome profiling of granulosa cells from small (10 mm, n?=? 4) healthy bovine follicles using Affymetrix microarrays (24, 128 probe sets). Results Principal component analysis for the first two components and hierarchical clustering showed clustering into two groups, small and large, with the former being more heterogeneous. Size-frequency distributions of the coefficient of variation of the signal intensities of each probe set also revealed that small follicles were more heterogeneous than the large. IPA and GO enrichment analyses revealed that processes of axonal guidance, immune signalling and cell rearrangement were most affected in large follicles. The most important networks were associated with: (A) Notch, SLIT/ROBO and PI 3 K signalling, and (B) ITGB 5 and extracellular matrix signalling through extracellular signal related kinases (ERKs). Upstream regulator genes which were predicted to be active in large follicles included STAT and XBP 1. By comparison, developmental processes such as those stimulated by KIT, IHH and MEST were most active in small follicles. MGEA 5 was identified as an upstream regulator in small follicles. It encodes an enzyme that modifies the activity of many target proteins, including those involved in energy sensing, by removal of N-acetylglucosamine from serine and threonine residues. Conclusions Our data suggest that as follicles enlarge more genes and/or pathways are activated than are inactivated, and gene expression becomes more uniform. These findings could be interpreted that either the cells in large follicles are more uniform in their gene expression, or that follicles are more uniform or a combination of both and that additional factors, such as LH, are additionally controlling the granulosa cells.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the effect of the}} preovulatory gonado-tropin surge on the temporal and spatial regulation of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and uPA receptor (uPAR) mRNA expression and tPA, uPA, and plasmin activity in bovine preovulatory follicles and new corpora lutea collected at approximately 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h after a GnRH-induced gonadotropin surge. Messenger RNAs for tPA, uPA, and uPAR were increased in a temporally specific fashion within 24 h of the gonadotropin surge. Locali-zation of tPA mRNA was primarily to the granulosal layer, whereas both uPA and uPAR mRNAs were detected in both the granulosal and thecal layers and adjacent ovarian stroma. Activ-ity for tPA was increased in follicular fluid and the preovulatory follicle apex and base within 12 h after the gonadotropin surge. The increase in tPA activity in the follicle base was transient, whereas the increased activity in the apex was maintained through the 24 h time point. Activity for uPA increased in the follicle apex and base within 12 h of the gonadotropin surge and remained elevated. Plasmin activity in follicular fluid also increased within 12 h after the preovulatory gonadotropin surge and was greatest at 24 h. Our results indicate that mRNA ex-pression and enzyme activity for both tPA and uPA are increased in a temporally and spatially specific manner in bovine preovu-latory follicles after exposure to a gonadotropin surge.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the experiments presented in this dissertation were to evaluate: (1) dose effects of a synthetic progestin (melengestrol acetate; MGA) on secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and 17 β-estradiol; (2) pattern of ovarian follicular development and concentrations of steroids and activity of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) in follicular fluid of normal and persistent ovarian follicles; and (3) involvement of local regulators in development and regression of ovarian follicles and corpora lutea (CL) in cattle. ^ Synthetic progestins {{have been used to}} synchronize the stage of the estrous cycle in beef cattle, however, acceptable fertility at the synchronized estrus has not been achieved. An increase in pulsatile secretion of LH and greater circulating concentrations of 17 β-estradiol were observed when estrous synchronization treatments were compared to midluteal phase of the estrous cycle. Greater doses of MGA than those typically used in estrous synchrony protocols did not suppress LH and 17 β-estradiol to the same extent as progesterone from CL. Greater pulsatile secretion of LH resulting from use of estrous synchrony treatments induces development of persistent ovarian follicles which may compromise fertility in <b>cattle.</b> Persistent ovarian <b>follicles</b> have greater concentrations of 17 β-estradiol and less activity of IGFBPs in follicular fluid than normally growing ovarian follicles. Therefore, greater LH pulse frequency and possibly less activity of IGFBPs in follicular fluid may facilitate the growth of persistent ovarian follicles and reduce fertility in cattle. Local regulators in the ovary may regulate development and regression of ovarian follicles and CL. Fas antigen (cell death inducer) mRNA was present in ovarian follicles and CL. Amounts of Fas antigen mRNA were greater in atretic ovarian follicles and regressing CL compared with healthy ovarian follicles and functional CL from cattle. Research presented herein provides basic information that enhances our understanding of mechanisms underlying ovarian follicular development and subsequent ovulation of a viable oocyte, and the formation of a functional corpus luteum and successful pregnancy in cattle. ...|$|R
40|$|Acne {{is one of}} the commonest skin {{diseases}} that dermatologists have to treat. The diagnosis of acne is usually made from the finding of the following aspects: 1) clinical features: acne vulgaris is characterized by a mixture of non-inflamed (open and closed comedones) and inflamed (papules, pustules, nodules) lesions; 2) topography of acne lesions, which involve face, back and chest; 3) epidemiology of the disease. Although acne may affect persons of all ages, the disease is most prevalent and most severe during adolescence; 4) occurrence of scars. Scarring represents a frequent outcome of acne and can lead to lifelong concern in regarding self-esteem. Even thought the diagnosis of acne is usually readily made, acne may be confused with several diseases, which can have a similar appearance. The following acneiform disorders may represent a differential diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Drug-induced acneiform eruptions are often sudden on onset and are usually more monomorphous in their appearance than acne vulgaris. A history of drug assumption is diriment for diagnosis, while the eruption resolves spontaneously following removal of the offending agent. Rosacea occurs most commonly in adults and is clinically characterized by facial flushing and erythema of the cheeks, nose, forehead and chin. Papules and pustules can develop within the areas of erythema. Scarring does not occur. Rosacea fulminans is an explosive form of rosacea, characterized by monstrous coalescent inflammatory lesions. Comedones are notably absent. The disease resolves with no or minimal scarring. In perioral dermatitis, erythema, scaling and small papules and pustules typically occur around the mouth and on the chin. Gram-negative folliculitis is characterized by the sudden development of superficial pustules in patients who have been treated for acne with antibiotics, which are ineffective in the long run. Bacteriology reveals a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria. Follicular pyodermas may mimic acne, especially when an acne-like distribution pattern is observed. However, the absence of comedones may suggest the proper diagnosis. Demodecidosis is a persistent disease of facial <b>follicles</b> due to <b>mites</b> of the species Demodex folliculorum and Demodex species. Comedones and scars are lacking and most of patients are 50 - 70 years of age. Diagnosis rests on demonstration of large numbers of mites. These represent only some of the skin disorders which may be misdiagnosed as acne vulgaris. An accurate evaluation of the clinical and history clues of acne is essential in properly diagnose and treat the disease...|$|R
