40|$|Convergent {{data suggest}} dissociated roles for the lateral (LA) and basolateral (BLA) amygdaloid nuclei in fear conditioning, {{depending}} on whether a discrete conditioned stimulus (CS) –unconditional stimulus (US) or context–US association is considered. Here, we show that pretraining inactivation of the BLA selectively impaired <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>context.</b> In contrast, inactivation of the LA disrupted conditioning to the discrete tone CS, but also either impaired or enhanced contextual conditioning, {{depending on whether}} the context was in the foreground or in the background. Hence, these findings refine the current model of the amygdala function in emotional learning by showing that the BLA and the LA not only differentially contribute to elemental and context–US association, but also promote, through their interaction, the most relevant of these two associations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUsing {{a genetic}} approach, we {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} mutations in protein kinase A (PKA) on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the mossy fiber pathway {{and its relationship to}} spatial and contextual learning. Ablation by gene targeting of the Cβ 1 or the RIβ isoform of PKA produces a selective defect in mossy fiber LTP, providing genetic evidence for the role of these isoforms in the mossy fiber pathway. Despite the elimination of mossy fiber LTP, the behavioral responses to novelty, spatial learning, and <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>context</b> are unaffected. Thus, contrary to current theories about hippocampal function, mossy fiber LTP {{does not appear to be}} required for spatial or contextual learning.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Consistent {{with the}} {{importance}} of the hippocampus in learning more complex stimulus relations, but not in simple associative learning, the dorsal hippocampus has commonly been implicated in clas-sical fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>context,</b> but not to discrete stimuli, such as a tone. In particular, a specific and central role in contextual fear condi-tioning has been attributed to mechanisms mediated by dorsal hippocam-pal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -type glutamate receptors. The present study characterized the effects of blockade or tonic stimulation of dorsal hippocampal NMDA receptors by bilateral local infusion of the noncom-petitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK- 801 (dizocilpine maleate; 6. 25 g/side) or of NMDA (0. 7 g/side), respectively, on classical fear conditioning to tone and context in Wistar rats. Freezing was used to measure conditioned fear.

40|$|Contextual fear <b>conditioning</b> {{is thought}} <b>to</b> involve the {{synaptic}} plasticity-dependent establishment in hippocampus of representations of to-be-conditioned contexts which can then become associated with USs in the amygdala. A conceptual and computational model {{of this process}} is proposed in which contextual attributes are assumed to be sampled serially and randomly during contextual exposures. Given this assumption, moment-to-moment information about such attributes will often be quite different from one exposure to another and, in particular, between exposures during which representations are created, exposures during which conditioning occurs, and during recall sessions. This presents challenges to current conceptual models of hippocampal function. In order to meet these challenges, our model's hippocampus was made to operate in different modes during representation creation and recall, and non-hippocampal machinery was constructed that controlled these hippocampal modes. This machinery uses a comparison between contextual information currently observed and information associated with existing hippocampal representations of familiar <b>contexts</b> <b>to</b> compute the Bayesian Weight of Evidence that the current context is (or is not) a known one, and it uses this value to assess the appropriateness of creation or recall modes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cholinergic {{neurotransmission}} {{has been}} implicated in the acquisition {{of a variety of}} tasks, including Pavlovian fear conditioning. To more precisely define the role of cholinergic modulation in this process, the effect of site-specific cholinergic antagonism was assessed. Male Long-Evans rats were implanted with chronic, bilateral cannulae aimed at the dorsal hippocampus. Infusions of scopolamine hydrobromide (50 mg bilaterally) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were made immediately prior to a signaled Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure. On consecutive days following training, all rats were given independent tests assessing freezing to both the training context and the tone conditional stimulus (CS). Relative to PBS infused controls, rats that received intrahippocampal infusions of scopolamine showed a significant attenuation of contextual freezing but comparable levels of freezing to the tone CS. Neither shock sensitivity nor general activity levels differed between rats infused with scopolamine or PBS. These findings suggest that fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>context,</b> but not discrete CS, requires intact cholinergic neurotransmis-sion in the hippocampus.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{are reported in}} which behavioral control by contextual cues was assessed in groups of rats with dorsal hippocampal (HC), neocortical (NC), or operated control (OC) lesions. Following Odling-Smee's (1975) procedure, a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm was followed in which conditioned stimuli (CSs: tone, light) predicted an unconditioned stimulus (US:footshock) always, never, or half the time. Conditioning trials {{took place in a}} small black box. Subsequently, conditioning to background contextual cues was assessed by measuring the amount of time rats spent in the black box in preference to an adjacent white one with neither CS nor US presented. In OC groups and, to a lesser extent, NC groups, conditioning to background cues was inversely related to the probability that CS predicted US. In contrast to graded contextual conditioning in control groups, the HC groups consistently showed abnormally strong <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>context</b> that was at or near asymptotic level. The results, which were related to current theories of the relation between contextual stimuli and CSs, suggest that the hippocampus may {{play an important role in}} stimulus selection during learning...|$|E

We used a conventional paired/unpaired Pavlovian protocol to induce a context specific sensitization to the locomotor stimulant effect of a high dose of apomorphine (2. 0 mg/kg). Two days following a 5 session sensitization induction phase, a brief 5 min non-drug test for conditioning was conducted. Only the paired groups exhibited locomotor stimulant conditioned response effects. Immediately following this brief test for conditioning, the paired and the unpaired groups received injections of 0. 05 mg/kg apomorphine, 2. 0 mg/kg apomorphine or vehicle designed to differentially impact memory re-consolidation of the conditioning. Two days later, all groups received a sensitization challenge test with 2. 0 mg/kg apomorphine. The 2. 0 mg/kg apomorphine post-trial treatment potentiated sensitization while the 0. 05 mg/kg eliminated sensitization. These effects were only observed in the paired groups. The activation of dopaminergic systems by the high dose of apomorphine strengthened the drug/environment association whereas the inhibition of dopamine activity by the low auto-receptor dose eliminated this association. The results point to the importance of <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>context</b> specific sensitization and targeting memory re-consolidation of conditioning as a paradigm to modify sensitization...|$|E

We examined the effect of PR lesions on delay <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> two different tone conditional stimuli (4 and 22 kHz tones; both 10 sec duration) and two different rat ultrasonic vocalization (USV) conditional stimuli (10 sec of “ 22 kHz USVs”). The two USV conditional stimuli were multi-call segments that were recorded (digitized at 100 kHz) from two different rats. One USV CS was a continuous sequence of eight calls, and the other was a portion of a continuous sequence of six calls. PR lesions significantly impaired <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> both USV conditional stimuli and <b>to</b> the training <b>context</b> but had no significant effect on <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> either tone CS.

40|$|Exposure {{of animals}} to footshocks (FS) in {{absence of any}} {{specific}} cue results {{in the development of}} fear to the compartment where shocks were given (contextual fear conditioning), and this is usually evaluated by time spent freezing. However, the extent to which contextual fear conditioning always develops when animals are exposed to other stressors is not known. In the present work we firstly demonstrated, using freezing, that exposure of adult rats to a single session of FS resulted in short-term and long-term contextual fear conditioning (freezing) that was paralleled by increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation. In contrast, using a similar design, no HPA or behavioral evidence for such conditioning was found after exposure to immobilization on boards (IMO), despite this stressor being of similar severity as FS on the basis of standard physiological measures of stress, including HPA activation. In a final experiment we directly compared the exposure to the two stressors in the same type of context and tested for the development of conditioning to the context and to a specific cue for IMO (the board). We observed the expected high levels of freezing and the conditioned HPA activation after FS, but not after IMO, regardless of the presence of the board during testing. Therefore, it can be concluded that development of fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>context</b> or particular cues, as evaluated by either behavioral or endocrine measures, appears to be dependent {{on the nature of the}} aversive stimuli, likely to be related to biologically preparedness to establish specific associations...|$|E

In experiment 1 we gave water deprived and non-deprived rats either three or ten pairings of a tone and foot shock. During conditioning water deprivation decreased overall freezing only in rats that received ten pairings. On 2 subsequent days we assessed conditioned freezing (1) to the contextual cues of the conditioning chamber and (2) to the tone when presented in a distinctive, novel environment. We found, in direct contrast to Maren et al. (Maren S, DeCola JP, Fanselow MS. Water deprivation enhances fear conditioning to contextual, but not discrete, conditional stimuli in rats. Behav Neurosci 1994; 108 : 645 - 9), that (a) water deprived rats {{did not differ from}} non-deprived rats in levels of conditioned contextual freezing and that (b) water deprived rats did show reduced levels of freezing to the tone stimulus. In the same experiment we found that the number of tone-shock pairings did not affect levels of conditioned contextual freezing but that rats that had received three pairings did show reduced levels of freezing to the tone stimulus compared with rats that had received ten pairings, thereby demonstrating that the behavioural procedure and analysis system that we used was appropriately sensitive to differences in conditioning. In experiment 2, therefore, we sought to replicate Maren et al. (Maren S, DeCola JP, Fanselow MS. Water deprivation enhances fear conditioning to contextual, but not discrete, conditional stimuli in rats. Behav Neurosci 1994; 108 : 645 - 9) using, as far as possible, exactly the same procedural parameters.

In the paired group, the CS elicited more US-expectancy than the context, whereas in the unpaired group, the context elicited more US-expectancy than the CS.

PR damage severely impairs delay fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and discontinuous tones (pips), but has no effect on delay <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> continuous tones (Kholodar-Smith, Allen, and Brown, in press).

Control animals received injections with phosphate-buffered saline. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the lesion volumes demonstrated that the neurotoxic damage was well-localized to PR and included most of its anterior-posterior extent.

40|$|Fear {{conditioning}} {{provides an}} ideal model for investigations {{of learning and}} memory processes. In addition, {{it has been used}} to model aspects of emotion dysregulation related to anxiety disorders. Fear conditioned freezing behavior is typically proportional to the number and magnitude of the footshocks used during <b>conditioning.</b> However, exposure <b>to</b> a significant stressor prior <b>to</b> fear <b>conditioning</b> can produce a disproportionately enhanced fear response (stress-enhanced fear learning, SEFL). In adult rats, exposure to an initial stressor (15 unsignalled footshocks) dramatically increases subsequent fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> a novel <b>context</b> or discrete tone CS. SEFL has been shown to persist for at least 3 months in adult rats, though little is known regarding the establishment and persistence of SEFL in rats exposed to the initial stress early in life. The present series of experiments assessed this by exposing juvenile rats to 0 or 15 footshocks in one context (stress exposure) on postnatal day 17 (PND 17). Subsequently, these rats were given 0 or 1 footshock(s) in a second, novel context (fear conditioning) on postnatal day 18, 24, or 90. Rats were tested for fear of both contexts over the next two consecutive days. Results indicate enhanced fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> the second <b>context</b> in rats previously exposed to 15 footshocks, regardless of age. Interestingly, rats that received 1 -footshock fear conditioning on PND 18 and no prior stress exposure show no context fear conditioning. By contrast, rats fear conditioned on PND 24 or PND 90 with no prior stress exposure show significant 1 -footshock fear conditioning. Taken together, these data suggest that footshock stress exposure enhances subsequent fear learning, even in very young rats that do not normally show fear conditioning...|$|R

40|$|Injection of the opioid {{receptor}} antagonist naloxone facilitated acquisition of fear to contextual and auditory conditioned stimuli (CSs) in Experiments 1 A and 1 B. Experiment 2 showed that prior <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> a distinctive <b>context</b> blocked <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> an auditory CS. Blocking of CS fear was prevented by administrations of naloxone or increases in footshock intensity. Blocking of CS fear was facilitated by decreases in footshock intensity in a naloxone-reversible manner. Experiment 3 showed that compound conditioning of two CSs, each previously and separately paired with shock, produced overexpectation {{of fear that}} was reversed by naloxone.

Placed in a novel context (a distinctive chamber) and exposed to pairings of a discrete conditioned stimulus (CS) with brief but aversive footshock (unconditioned stimulus [US]), rats learn about this relation between the context, the CS, and US.

40|$|Exposure to {{prolonged}} {{stress is}} {{associated with an increased}} risk for mood disorders. However, {{only a small portion of}} those who experience such distress go on to develop these disorders, suggesting that individual and stress-related variables may increase the vulnerability to the damaging effects of chronic stress. Accordingly, the present series of experiments assess the influence of three factors on vulnerability to long-term exposure to chronic variable stress (CVS) in rats. In particular, we investigated the influence of gender, chronic fluoxetine treatment and early life maternal care on the behavioral and neuroendocrine response to CVS. The results from study 1 suggested that the direction of the behavioral and neuroendocrine response to CVS was in the opposite direction in male and female rats. Studies 2 and 3 revealed that fluoxetine treatment had a gender-dependent ability to reverse some of the effects of CVS, and this was mediated by increasing the rate of habituation to novel, acute stressors. Studies 4 and 5 demonstrated a gender-dependent effect of maternal care on behavior and the neuroendocrine response to an acute stress. In addition, maternal care influenced the impact of CVS exposure in a gender-dependent manner. The results suggested that maternal care affected coping processes in males and females that were expressed in different behavioral tests. Studies 5, 6 and 7 revealed that maternal care influenced the strength of associative fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> a <b>context</b> associated with shock administration, but did not influence <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> a discrete conditioned stimulus associated with shock.

Thus, conditions in the post-weaning environment, such as CVS exposure, may reverse the effects of materna...|$|R
40|$|The {{roles of}} the dorsal {{hippocampus}} and the central nucleus of the amygdala in the expression of contextual fear were as-sessed using two measures of conditioned fear: freezing and fear-potentiated startle. A discriminable context conditioning paradigm was developed that demonstrated both conditioned freezing and fear-potentiated startle in a context paired previ-ously with foot shock, relative <b>to</b> a <b>context</b> in which foot shock had never been presented. Post-training lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala completely blocked both contextual freezing and fear-potentiated startle. Post-training lesions of the dorsal hippocampus attenuated contextual freezing, con-sistent with previous reports in the literature; however, these same lesions {{had no effect on}} fear-potentiated startle, suggest-ing preserved contextual fear. These results suggest that le-sions of the hippocampus disrupt the freezing response but not contextual fear itself. Key words: context; fear; conditioning; hippocampus; amyg-dala; freezing; startle; learning; memory It is commonly believed that contextual fear conditioning, like spatial learning, is a hippocampal-dependent task. The primary evidence supporting this conclusion has come from studies that evaluated the effects of amygdala or hippocampal lesions on freezing elicited by either contextual or explicit cues (Kim and Fanselow, 1992; Phillips and LeDoux, 1992). In these studies, an explicit cue was paired with shock in a distinctive context. After training, fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> the <b>context</b> was assessed by the amount of freezing the animals displayed when returned <b>to</b> the <b>context</b> in which they were trained. Fear to the explicit cue was assessed by the amount of freezing elicited by the cue when presented in a neutral context. Amygdala lesions blocked freezing <b>to</b> both the <b>context</b> and the explicit cue, consistent with the notion that this structure is critically involved in mediating conditioned fear responses (Kapp et al., 1982, 1984; Davis, 1992; LeDoux, 1992).

40|$|The {{hippocampus}} and amygdala {{are thought}} to be functionally distinct components of different learning and memory systems. This functional dissociation has been particularly apparent in pavlovian fear conditioning, where the integrity of the hippocampus is necessary for contextual conditioning, and of the amygdala for discrete cue conditioning. Their respective roles in appetitive conditioning, however, remain equivocal mainly {{due to the lack of}} agreement concerning the operational definition of a 'context'. The present study used a novel procedure <b>to</b> measure appetitive <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> spatial <b>context</b> or <b>to</b> a discrete cue. Following selective excitotoxic lesions of the hippocampus (HPC) or basolateral amygdala (BLA), rats were initially trained to acquire discrete CS-sucrose conditioning in a Y-maze apparatus with three topographically identical chambers, the chambers discriminated only on the basis of path integration. The same group of animals then underwent 'place/contextual conditioning' where the CS presented in a chamber assigned as the positive chamber was paired with sucrose, but the same CS presented in either of the other two chambers was not. Thus, spatial context was the only cue that the animal could use to retrieve the value of the CS. HPC lesions impaired the acquisition of conditioned place preference but facilitated the acquisition of cue conditioning, while BLA lesions had the opposite effect, retarding the acquisition of cue conditioning but leaving the acquisition of conditioned place preference intact. Here we provide strong support for the notion that the HPC and BLA subserve complementary and competing roles in appetitive cue and contextual conditioning...|$|R

CainRats {{reared in}} an enriched {{condition}} (EC) with novel stimuli and social contact with cohorts display less sensitization to nicotine than rats reared under impoverished conditions (IC). However, {{it is currently}} unknown what effect differential rearing has on nicotine-induced conditioned hyperactivity. The present study determined whether differential rearing affects <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> a nicotine-associated <b>context.</b> In addition, this study also {{examined the effects of}} mecamylamine, an antagonist to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, on conditioned hyperactivity and sensitization. This antagonistic drug has been shown to attenuate the locomotor effects of nicotine. In the current study, EC, IC, and social condition (SC) rats were reared from 21 to 51 days of age before training for the acquisition of conditioned hyperactivity and sensitization. Nicotine (0. 4 mg/kg) was administered prior to 1 -h locomotor sessions. Conditioned hyperactivity testing followed. Rats then received 5 sessions of sensitization training followed by a 16 -day drug-free rest period before being tested for sensitization. Mecamylamine (1. 0 mg/kg) was administered to rats prior to the conditioned hyperactivity test and sensitization test. Nicotine treatment resulted in sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity in all differential rearing groups. EC rats displayed less locomotor activity in response to nicotine than both IC and SC rats. Pretreatment with mecamylamine blocked the expression of conditioned hyperactivity in EC and SC rats and attenuated sensitization in all three rearing groups. These findings suggest that environmental enrichment may alter nAChR binding during development and may be a protective factor in the initiation and relapse of smoking behavior...|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Anxiety {{disorders}} {{are estimated to}} impact 1 in 4 individuals within their lifetime. For some individuals, repeated episodes of the stress response leads to pathological anxiety and depression. The stress response is linked to increased levels of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA), a putative site for regulating anxiety and associative processes related to aversive emotional memories, and activation of CRF receptors in the BLA of rats produces anxiety-like behavior. Mimicking repeated episodes of the stress response, sub-anxiogenic doses of urocortin 1 (Ucn 1), a CRF receptor agonist, are microinjected into the BLA of rats for five consecutive days, a procedure called priming. This results in 1) behavioral sensitization, such that a previously non-efficacious dose of Ucn 1 will elicit anxiety-like response after the 3 rd injection and 2) {{the development of a}} persistent anxiety-like phenotype that lasts at least five weeks after the last injection without any further treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to identify mechanisms involved in the Ucn 1 -priming-induced anxiogenesis. The first a set of experiments revealed that the anxiety-like behavior was not due <b>to</b> aversive <b>conditioning</b> <b>to</b> the <b>context</b> or partner cues of the testing environment. Next, Ucn 1 -priming-induced gene expression changes in the BLA were identified: mRNA expression for Sst 2, Sst 4, Chrna 4, Chrma 4, and Gabrr 1 was significantly reduced in Ucn 1 -primed compared to Vehicle-primed rats. Of these, Sst 2 emerged as the primary receptor of interest. Subsequent studies found that antagonizing the Sstr 2 resulted in anxiety-like behavior and activation of Sstr 2 blocked acute Ucn 1 -induced anxiety-like responses. Furthermore, pretreatment with a Sstr 2 agonist delayed the behavioral sensitization observed in Ucn 1 -induced priming but did not stop the development of persistent anxiety-like behavior or the Ucn 1 -priming-induced decrease in the Sstr 2 mRNA. These results suggest that the decrease in Sstr 2 mRNA is associated with the expression of persistent anxiety-like behavior but dissociated from the mechanisms causing the behavioral sensitization. Pharmacological studies confirmed that a reduced Sstr 2 mediated effect in the BLA is likely {{to play a role in}} persistent anxiety and should be investigated further...|$|R
