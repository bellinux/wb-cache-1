25|$|In the {{original}} game, the player could {{choose one of}} three races; Romans, Egyptians and Asians. Quest of the Amazons added the Amazons as a fourth race. Unlike in previous Settlers titles, each race has a slightly different economic model. For example, the Romans' and Amazons' construction industries require roughly equal amounts of wood and stone, the Egyptians' requires more stone than wood, and the Asians' more wood than stone. Each race also has specific skills; for example, only the Romans can turn wood into coal; only the Egyptians <b>can</b> <b>build</b> <b>on</b> desert terrain; only the Asians can mine sulfur; and only the Amazons can build war machines which use manna rather than physical ammunition.|$|E
500|$|Footage {{from the}} first episode was {{screened}} at New York Comic Con in October 2015, while the first trailer for the season was released in November. Alice Walker of Screen Rant felt that [...] "this promo highlights {{the best parts of}} the show. Fast paced and slick, Atwell is still incredibly charming....There is {{a long way to go}} before we see if they <b>can</b> <b>build</b> <b>on</b> the momentum from the previous season, but so far it looks like a fun adventure." [...] Conversely, Kaitlin Thomas at TV.com called the promo [...] "weird", asking, [...] "Why is ABC marketing Agent Carter like it's one of the network's casually daft melodramas instead of a well-written drama...From a tonal and thematic standpoint, the series depicted in that trailer feels like the polar opposite of what it actually is....cutting together a bunch of scenes of Peggy punching people or holding a gun does not make her a badass when its framed in this way, and frankly, it's no wonder people aren't tuning in if that's the type of show they think this is." [...] In March 2016, Maureen Ryan, writing for Variety, described the season's promotion as [...] "lackluster", and blamed it, as well as other factors that included [...] "the botched rollout of Season 2", on the season's ultimately poor viewership.|$|E

She consulted Dong Xi about her incertitude, and Dong emboldened her by saying, [...] "The lands in Jiangdong enjoy natural barriers from mountains and rivers, while the good government and virtue of Sun Ce have already won {{the hearts of the}} people.
