40|$|AOC Archaeology Group {{undertook}} {{the excavation}} of a previously unknown Bronze Age cist, {{located in a}} field close to Kilkeddan Farm, Argyll & Bute, during September 2005 under the Historic Scotland <b>call-off</b> <b>contract</b> for human remains. The cist was found to contain poorly surviving unburnt human skeletal remains along with a finely decorated tripartite Food Vessel and a flint knife. The incomplete and fragmentary condition of the skeleton suggests that the human remains were disarticulated {{at the time of}} deposition. Radiocarbon dates obtained from the human bone and associated charcoal confirms an early Bronze Age date for the burial...|$|E
40|$|Two stone-built short cists were {{excavated}} in Broomlands, Kelso, by AOC Archaeology Group {{under the}} Historic Scotland <b>Call-off</b> <b>Contract</b> for Human Remains. A single poorly preserved adult inhumation was recovered from one cist, {{along with a}} small intrusive disc-shaped perforated oil shale object. The inhumation was dated to 2340 – 2120 cal BC. The second cist contained heavily damaged and fragmentary unburnt bones from two adults. Radiocarbon dates suggest one individual, the principal interment in the cist, dates to 2030 – 1750 BC and the second individual was interred much later, between 930 and 800 cal BC. ...|$|E
40|$|Promoting the {{development}} of a flourishing independent sector alongside good quality public services was a key objective of the community care reforms of the last decade. This paper charts some of the ways the independent domiciliary care sector is changing, as local authorities shift the balance of their provision toward independent sector providers and away from a reliance on in-house services. Two surveys of independent domiciliary care providers were carried out in 1995 and 1999. The aims of the studies were to describe the main features of provider organisations, such as size of business, client group and funding sources; to examine the nature of provider motivations and their past and future plans; to consider how local authorities manage the supply side of social care markets; and to examine the effects on providers of {{the development}} of the mixed economy. The first survey in 1995 was conducted in eight local authority areas, which by 1999 had increased to 11 because of the creation of three new unitary authorities. The findings are based on 261 postal surveys together with 111 interviews between the two studies. The research illustrates a domiciliary care market that is still relatively young with many small but growing businesses. There are considerable differences in the split between in-house and independent sector services in individual authorities and a common perception among independent providers that in-house services receive favourable treatment and conditions. Spot or <b>call-off</b> <b>contracts</b> continue to be {{the most common form of}} contract although there are moves toward greater levels of guaranteed service and more sophisticated patterns of contracting arrangements. There remains an ongoing need to share information between local authorities and independent providers so that good working relationships can develop with proven and competent providers...|$|R
40|$|In 2002 {{human remains}} were {{reported}} eroding from {{a section of}} sandy cliff {{on the eastern side}} of the island of Pabay Mor, Isle of Lewis. Subsequent excavation of the site was undertaken by GUARD, as part of the Historic Scotland Human Remains <b>Call-off</b> <b>Contract.</b> This revealed a burial of a mature male of approximately 50 - 59 years of age, placed in a grave adjacent to a marker stone. The burial was crouched and aligned north-south and accompanied by a small undecorated pot, a polished stone and a pumice polisher. A radiocarbon date of 1450 - 1290 cal BC (GU- 13838) was obtained from human bone from the burial. A second, infant, individual, represented only by a fragment of mandible, was identified from disarticulated remains found at the burial...|$|E
40|$|A well-preserved burial, {{discovered}} during peat clearing on Langwell Farm in Strath Oykel, Easter Ross, {{consisted of}} a stone cist that held the skeleton {{of a woman who}} had died in 2200 – 1960 cal BC. Although the cist contents were disturbed and partly removed before archaeological investigation took place, the burial rite can be interpreted to some extent. The woman, who died in her late 20 s, had been wrapped in brown cattle hide, and wooden and woven objects were placed with her body. Periodic waterlogging created conditions that allowed the rare, partial preservation of the organic materials. Analysis of bone histology indicated that decay of the human remains had been arrested, either by deliberate mummification or by waterlogging. The cist had been set in a low knoll on the valley floor and it may have been covered by a low cairn or barrow. This spot has been the site of a fire several hundred years earlier and {{it may have been a}} node on a cross-country route linking east and west coasts in the Early Bronze Age. The use of animal hide suggests the creation and use of particular identities, linking the dead to ancestors and to powerful spiritual properties attributed to the natural world.
