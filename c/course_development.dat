As such, the university decided not to compete for new professional programs and generally avoided post-graduate <b>course</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E

60|$|In {{the civilization}} of Japan we have {{presented}} to us a most interesting case of partially arrested development; or, to speak esoterically, {{we find ourselves}} placed {{face to face with}} a singular example of a completed race-life. For though from our standpoint the evolution of these people seems suddenly to have come to an end in mid-career, looked at more intimately it shows all the signs of having fully run its <b>course.</b> <b>Development</b> ceased, not because of outward obstruction, but from purely intrinsic inability to go on. The intellectual machine was not shattered; it simply ran down. To this fact the phenomenon owes its peculiar interest. For we behold here in the case of man the same spectacle that we see cosmically in the case of the moon, the spectacle of a world that has died of old age. No weak spot in their social organism destroyed them from within; no epidemic, in the shape of foreign hordes, fell upon them from without. For in spite of the fact that China offers the unique example of a country that has simply lived to be conquered, mentally her masters have invariably become her pupils. Having ousted her from her throne as ruler, they proceeded to sit at her feet as disciples. Thus they have rather helped than hindered her civilization.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} high school student achievement in child development concepts that are reflected in the Pennsylvania Family and Consumer Sciences Child Development Standards. A secondary goal of this research was to compare student achievement in child development concepts in child <b>development</b> <b>courses</b> that include a laboratory as an integral part of the course with achievement in child <b>development</b> <b>courses</b> that do not include a laboratory component. The design was a pretest-posttest experiment using an instrument which was developed for this study. The treatment was exposure to a high school semester-long family and consumer sciences <b>course</b> in child <b>development.</b> The subjects were 431 students from nine high schools in Pennsylvania. The experimental group consisted of two subgroups; one of the subgroups consisted of high school students enrolled in a semester-long child <b>development</b> <b>course</b> that was didactic in nature, without a child development laboratory experience. The second subgroup consisted of high school students enrolled in a semester-long child <b>development</b> <b>course</b> that was a combination of didactic instruction and experience in a child development laboratory. Students who were never enrolled in a child <b>development</b> <b>course</b> participated in the control group. The findings from this study offer evidence that participation in a high school semester-long child <b>development</b> <b>course</b> has a positive effect on students' knowledge of child development concepts. After the experimental group participated in a child <b>development</b> <b>course,</b> they differed significantly in their knowledge compared to the comparison group who did not participate in a child <b>development</b> <b>course.</b> A high school child <b>development</b> semester <b>course,</b> as evaluated in this study, does appear to have a significant impact on students' knowledge of child development concepts. Students who took a child <b>development</b> <b>course</b> showed significant improvement on posttests compared to pretest scores. Child development students who participated in a laboratory experience showed a significantly greater improvement on tests scores over child development students who took a didactic-style child <b>development</b> <b>course</b> with no laboratory experience...|$|R
