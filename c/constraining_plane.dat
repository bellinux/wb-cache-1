40|$|Abstract − Structured light {{systems are}} widely used for {{three-dimensional}} shape reconstruction. The accuracy of the vision system parameters {{is of paramount importance}} for the accuracy of the 3 D reconstruction. Often the extrinsic parameters change over time due to environmental conditions, in order to compensate for structured light parameters change, a self-recalibration method based on planar homography is proposed in this paper. The method uses the planar homography of corresponding points in two camera views to identify the relative position and orientation between the two cameras: one is the “real ” camera, while the other is a reference solid considered as a “pseudocamera”. The laser plane of the structured light vision system is the <b>constraining</b> <b>plane</b> for the two cameras corresponding points...|$|E

Discrete Math. 12 (1999), no. 1, 136 – 153 (electronic). A plane configuration {{is a collection}} of geometric objects (points, segments, arcs, etc.) in the plane, along with a set of constraints on these objects. Many problems in computer-aided design can be modeled as plane configurations. Of special interest is whether a configuration is realizable, and if so, whether it is uniquely realizable. The constraints can be written as a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, and many questions about configurations can be settled by computing the rank of the Jacobian matrix of this system. However, the system is usually large and usually contains degeneracies, which render numerical solutions slow and unstable. So, purely combinatorial answers are desirable. There are theories that provide these answers when the constraints are solely on the distance of certain pairs of points or solely on the directions defined by certain pairs of points. This paper presents a combinatorial theory based on matroids for the mixed case, when the constraints are on distances or directions...|$|E

During the LRO nominal mission, when LRO flew in a low circular orbit, orbit determination requirements were met nearly 100 % of the time.

The comparison of the experimental results and the finite element simulations shows that, when the axial strain on the FBG sensor is the dominant component, the standard wavelength-shift strain relation can be used even if large lateral strains apply on the sensor. However when this is not the case, large errors may be introduced in the conversion of the wavelength to axial strains on the fiber.

40|$|Aircraft {{performance}} optimization {{continues to}} play an important role in the aerospace sciences. The studies undertaken in this dissertation explore the performance of high-speed aircraft with regard to missile evasion, minimum-time-to-climb, minimum-time-to-turn, and the unorthodox approach of obtaining a robust optimality-based control law for real-time aircraft control. The dissertation includes four papers presented or accepted for presentation at major conferences and presently in various stages of review for publication in scholarly journals;The similarity in each paper, in addition to the focus on optimal aircraft trajectories, is that an existing nonlinear programming method, sequential quadratic programming (SQP), is used to treat each trajectory optimization problem. This approach is suitable since the emphasis is on applications and problem solving, and the method is accurate and computationally inexpensive. Also, the flexibility of SQP allows for performance index, mathematical model, and constraint changes with relatively little reprogramming. This enables a wide range of trajectory optimization problems to be formulated and studied;In the study of the aircraft missile-evasion problem in horizontal planar flight, unlike earlier investigations, the full original equations of motion are used. Also, no linearization about a nominal pursuit triangle is done. The velocity ratio, that is, the velocity of the aircraft to the velocity of the missile for the duration of the confrontation, becomes a major factor in deciding optimal evasive strategies. Evasion against a surface-to-air missile involves a large nonlinear optimal control problem of dynamic order of at least thirteen. 2 ̆ 2 Inward 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 outward 2 ̆ 2, pull-up, dive, and inverted pull-down evasive maneuvers are investigated. The results show that the missile enters the 2 ̆ 2 hit region 2 ̆ 2 of the aircraft for <b>constrained</b> vertical <b>plane</b> flight, but not for constrained horizontal flight. The optimal throttle setting for <b>constrained</b> horizontal <b>plane</b> flight is of 2 ̆ 2 bang-bang 2 ̆ 2 type;For the minimum-time turn problems, having free final velocity provides the biggest impact on turn times, which can be reduced by as much as fifty percent. For a wide range of final energies studied in the three-dimensional turns, it was found that the aircraft tends to initially lose altitude in the optimal turn even though the nominal control from which the optimization process started corresponds to an initial climbing turn. This tendency of favoring kinetic energy over potential energy had not been featured in earlier papers;Finally, the investigation of optimality-based control laws for real-time aircraft control is a significant departure from the usual open-loop solutions to trajectory optimization problems. It was found that the robustness of the optimal control obtained from the 2 ̆ 2 optimality-condition 2 ̆ 2 is not guaranteed, but by introducing a certain 2 ̆ 2 correction 2 ̆ 2 term, it can be enhanced significantly.
