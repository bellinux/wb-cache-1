5|$|The {{first section}} of the freeway opened in 1963, east of I-805. The {{extension}} of the freeway west to I-5 was delayed in order to <b>coincide</b> {{with the construction of}} the flood channel for the Sweetwater River. While construction started in 1984, a court stopped the process for a few years, and this portion was not complete until 1992. The final section of freeway, which was upgraded from an expressway, opened in 2007, to <b>coincide</b> with the extension of SR125 south to Otay Mesa.|$|E
5|$|The global {{definition}} of the Earth's field {{is based on a}} mathematical model. If a line is drawn {{through the center of the}} Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would <b>coincide</b> and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not <b>coincide</b> and compasses do not generally point at either.|$|E

5|$|The icebergs' melting caused {{extensive}} {{amounts of}} fresh water {{to be added to}} the North Atlantic. Such inputs of cold and fresh water may well have altered the density-driven, thermohaline circulation patterns of the ocean, and often <b>coincide</b> with indications of global climate fluctuations.|$|E
5|$|The {{service was}} rebranded as The Witch Way in 2005 to <b>coincide</b> with the {{introduction}} of new vehicles. It had previously been branded as The X43 and before then was unbranded. Between 1982 and 1986 the route was known as Timesaver, with buses carrying dedicated liveries.|$|E
5|$|A script book of Quatermass and the Pit was {{released}} by Penguin Books in April 1960, with a cover by Kneale's artist brother Bryan Kneale.

The theatrical company Creation Productions staged a live adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit in a quarry near Nottingham in August 1997.|$|E
50|$|The {{particular}} case of 2-consistency <b>coincides</b> with arc consistency (all problems are assumed node-consistent in this article). On the other hand, 3-consistency <b>coincides</b> with path consistency only if all constraints are binary, because path consistency {{does not involve}} ternary constraints while 3-consistency does.|$|R

Whereas the fractional derivative in (28) <b>coincides</b> with the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative (7) when b= 0 and α= 1, it <b>coincides</b> with the Hadamard fractional integral (13) once b= 0 and α→ 0 and with the generalized fractional integral (21) when b= 0.|$|R
30|$|The {{fractional}} derivative in (59) <b>coincides</b> {{with the}} Caputo derivative (8) when a= 0 and α= 1, the Caputo Hadamard fractional derivative (15) if a= 0 and α→ 0 {{and with the}} generalized fractional integral (22) when a= 0. Meanwhile the fractional derivative in (60) <b>coincides</b> with the Caputo derivative (9) when b= 0 and α= 1, it <b>coincides</b> with the Hadamard fractional integral (17) once b= 0 and α→ 0 and with the generalized fractional integral (23) when b= 0.|$|R
5|$|After {{a number}} of {{attempts}} to adapt the series into a feature film, director Zack Snyder's Watchmen was released in 2009. A video game series, , was released {{in the same year}} to <b>coincide</b> with the film's release. In 2012, DC Comics published Before Watchmen, a comic-book series acting as a prequel to the original Watchmen series, without Moore and Gibbons' involvement.|$|E
5|$|After {{the launch}} of the {{persecution}} campaign in 1999, practitioners outside China began holding frequent protests, rallies, and appeals. These include large-scale marches, demonstrations, and vigils to <b>coincide</b> with notable anniversaries, such as April 25, 1999, and July 20, 1999. Marches typically involve participants holding signs and banners, devoting different sections of the parade to different aspects of the persecution. There is usually a section involving participants wearing only white (symbolizing mourning) and holding photos of those killed in China.|$|E
5|$|Although wolf-dog {{hybridization}} in Europe {{has raised}} concern among conservation groups fearing for the gray wolf's purity, genetic tests show that introgression of dog genes into European gray wolf populations does {{not pose a}} significant threat. Also, as wolf and dog mating seasons do not fully <b>coincide,</b> the likelihood of wild wolves and dogs mating and producing surviving offspring is small.|$|E
50|$|The Lunar {{equatorial}} {{regions are}} likely to have higher concentrations of helium-3 (rare on Earth but much sought after for use in nuclear fusion research) because the solar wind has a higher angle of incidence. They also enjoy an advantage in extra-Lunar traffic: The rotation advantage for launching material is slight due to the Moon's slow rotation, but the corresponding orbit <b>coincides</b> with the ecliptic, nearly <b>coincides</b> with the Lunar orbit around Earth, and nearly <b>coincides</b> with the equatorial plane of Earth.|$|R
