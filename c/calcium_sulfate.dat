5|$|Fumarolic {{activity}} affects {{surrounding rocks}} and pyroclastics. Carbonates, opal, and white covers of possibly aluminum sulfate and <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> have been formed. Gypsum formed from the sulfur {{of the volcano}} {{is found in the}} form of crystals in the upper valleys of Taftan. Sinter and hydrothermally altered rocks are found farther down. Minerals formed by alteration processes include alunite, calcite, cristobalite, illite, jarosite, kaolinite, pyrophyllite, quartz, smectite, sulfur and tridymite. Some epithermal mineralizations have been identified around Taftan. Other secondary factors at Taftan include lahars.|$|E
40|$|This study {{collected}} four ground granulated {{blast furnace}} slags from different manufacturing locations for CaO-activation {{to investigate the}} influence of the slag characteristics on strength development and the reaction products. Despite the seemingly similar characteristics of the slags, each slag developed significantly different strengths varying from 25 to 52 MPa at 28 days and different reaction products. The main reaction products were C-S-H and calcium hydroxide in all the samples; however, various forms of AFm phases appeared depending on the presence of calcite and <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfates</b> in the raw slags. Ettringite was also found in the case of raw slag with <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfates.</b> In this study, strength development was not governed by any single dominant material parameter of the raw slag, but rather by the combination of various favorable factors such as a higher content of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfates,</b> a smaller overall particle size distribution and a higher basicity (or chemical indexes). clos...|$|R

5000|$|Opportunity found {{evidence}} for magnesium sulfates on Mars (one form {{of it is}} epsomite, or [...] "Epsom salts"), in 2004. Curiosity has detected <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfates</b> on Mars. (Curiosity is currently exploring ancient deposits {{at the base of}} Mount Sharp. It won't reach the youngest Magnesium Sulfate deposits towards the summit of Mt. Sharp until towards the end of its extended mission if that goes ahead). Orbital maps also suggest that hydrated sulfates may be common on Mars.

5|$|Selenium occurs {{naturally}} {{in a number}} of inorganic forms, including selenide, selenate, and selenite, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (<b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing {{a small part of the}} sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
25|$|The main use of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> is {{to produce}} plaster of Paris and stucco. These {{applications}} exploit the fact that <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> which has been powdered and calcined forms a moldable paste upon hydration and hardens as crystalline <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> dihydrate. It is also convenient that <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> is poorly soluble in water and does not readily dissolve in contact with water after its solidification.|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of water vapour sorption by powdered cement constituents exposed to different relative humidities and temperatures was studied. The individual clinker phases C 3 S, C 2 S, C(3) A, C(4) AF, <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfates</b> and CaO were tested. Using a water sorption balance, {{the amount of}} chemically and physically sorbed water per unit of surface area of the powders and the relative humidity at which water sorption starts to occur on the phases were determined. Various cement clinker phases prehydrate very differently. CaO and C(3) A {{were found to be}} most reactive towards water vapour whereas the silicates react less. CaO starts to sorb water at very low RHs and binds it chemically. Beginning at 55 % RH, orthorhombic C(3) A also sorbs significant amounts of water and binds it chemically and physically. Water sorption of C 3 S and C 2 S only begins at 74 % RH, and the amount of water sorbed is minor. <b>Calcium</b> <b>sulfates</b> sorb water predominantly physically. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|The {{dissolution}} of the different crystalline phases of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> in water is exothermic and release heat (decrease in Gibbs free energy: Δ G < 0). As an immediate consequence, to proceed, the dissolution reaction needs to evacuate this heat that {{can be considered as}} a product of reaction. If the system is cooled, the dissolution equilibrium will evolve towards the right according to the Le Chatelier principle and <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> will dissolve more easily. The solubility of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> increases thus when the temperature decreases. If the temperature of the system is raised, the reaction heat cannot dissipate and the equilibrium will regress towards the left according to Le Chatelier principle. The solubility of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> decreases thus when temperature increases. This contra-intuitive solubility behaviour is called retrograde solubility. It is less common than for most of the salts whose dissolution reaction is endothermic (i.e., the reaction consumes heat: increase in Gibbs free energy: Δ G > 0) and whose solubility increases with temperature. Another calcium compound, calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2, portlandite) also exhibits a retrograde solubility for the same thermodynamic reason: because its dissolution reaction is also exothermic and releases heat. So, to dissolve higher amounts of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> or calcium hydroxide in water, it is necessary to cool down the solution close to its freezing point in place to increase its temperature or to use nearly boiling water.|$|E
