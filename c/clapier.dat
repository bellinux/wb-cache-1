The group came to the conclusion that the Col de <b>Clapier</b> was the most likely pass, an opinion still supported by some modern historians.|$|E
50|$|Around 1860, the old <b>Clapier</b> castle was {{demolished}} {{along with}} the hamlet of <b>Clapier.</b> The Châtelus pit {{was connected to the}} old <b>Clapier</b> pit and 5th layer was explored but the digging of a new pit was required. The digging of a new pit named Châtelus 2 started in 1870.|$|E

50|$|In {{the center}} of the village, the <b>Clapier</b> castle is made of the remains of a medieval fort, {{probably}} built by the Hospitallers of Jerusalem. The bottom part of a tower contains several arrow slits. It was ruined at the times of the Wars of Religion, but was partially reconstructed in the 17th and 18th centuries to become a farm. Episcopal archives mention that the fort of <b>Clapier</b> was built for pilgrims on the Way of St. James to shelter them from wolves and brigands. It contained dormitories, a bread oven, the commander's residence and a prison.|$|E

50|$|From 2004-2008, Patrick Hunt, {{a scholar}} from Stanford University (USA), has led {{numerous}} archaeological expeditions through the Col de <b>Clapier</b> {{to research the}} possibility and likelihood of Hannibal using this pass to traverse the Alps with his army. Hunt's research has involved topographical surveys, soil and rock sampling, exploration of the Col de Clapier's various modern and historic routes, and comparisons of Polybius' and Livy's accounts of Hannibal's passage to the regional and local geography. See Hannibal in the Alps: Stanford Alpine Archaeology Project 1994-2006.|$|E

50|$|The Belgian Air Force {{purchased}} 20 {{examples of}} the RSV 22/180. In 1928, Lt Edmond Thieffry and SLt Philippe Quersin piloted a civil-registered RSV 22/180 (registration O-BAJE) on an attempt at a long-distance flight to Africa. They departed Deurne on 26 June, attempting to reach Kinshasa. Bad weather forced them to land at Mourmelon, France, only 230 km away. Resuming their journey, they were forced down a second time, this time in a marsh at <b>Clapier,</b> near Vauvert, still in France. They abandoned the attempt {{at this point and}} successfully returned to Belgium.|$|E
5000|$|Drexel {{was born}} on October 24, 1891. He {{was the son of}} Anthony Joseph Drexel, Jr. (1864-1934) and Margarita Armstrong (1867-1948). [...] His eldest sister was Margaretta Armstrong Drexel (1885-1952), who married Guy Finch-Hatton, 14th Earl of Winchilsea (1885-1939). in 1910. His brother, Anthony Joseph Drexel II (1887-1946), married Marjorie G. Gould (1890-1955), the eldest {{daughter}} of George Jay Gould I. His youngest brother was Louis <b>Clapier</b> Norris Drexel (1896-1962), who married Nancy Doreen Harrington Grayson (1899-1962), daughter of Sir Henry Grayson, 1st Baronet and Dora Harrington, in 1919.|$|E
50|$|Maria debuted on French stage, April 23, 1867; she {{appeared}} in the French Theatre in New York acting the part of Caesarine <b>Clapier</b> in the vaudeville of Le Marly dans du Coon. Barney and Maria appeared in The Emerald Ring at the Broadway Theatre in New York, April 5, 1869. On April 28, 1869, Barney played the last night the theatre was open in Ireland As It Was as Ragged Pat. Barney and Maria began an engagement in Connie Soogah, or the Jolly Peddler on September 21, 1874, at Booth’s Theatre in New York. In December 1875 Barney performed - perhaps for last time - at Booth’s theatre, The Coonie Soogah and The Fairy Circle.|$|E
50|$|Located west of Saint-Étienne, {{the site}} is located within the {{perimeter}} of the old town of Montaud, then split with the ephemeral town of Beaubrun (1842-1855) which is finally integrated in Saint-Étienne in 1855.Certified since the 18th century, coal mining in this area is due to the presence of an anticline bringing three shallow exploitable layers to the surface (the first, second and third layers of the Beaubrun part of the pit). The rugged terrain of the area of the old locality known as the <b>Clapier</b> reflects the previous exploitation of the outcrops of these coal layers. These old quarries have also provided the sandstone needed to create underground work (called overturned bleachers) until the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|He {{made two}} further {{attempts}} to reach Congo. The first on 9 March 1928 in an ACAZ C.2 with Joseph Lang and Philippe Quersin, {{did not get}} any further than Philippeville. The second on 26 June in a Stampe et Vertongen RSV.22-180, again with Philippe Quersin, also failed, this time ending in a marsh at <b>Clapier,</b> near Vauvert. Thieffry then developed a plan {{to set up an}} internal air service in Congo. During his second test flight in Congo on 11 April 1929, flying an Aviméta 92, Thieffry, with fellow flyer Gaston Julien, was killed in a crash close to Lake Tanganyika (only a mechanic survived). He was 36 years old. It would be another 10 years before a regular air service was established between Brussels and Kinshasa.|$|E
5000|$|The {{village is}} located 640 meters above sea level, West of the Causse du Larzac, which is 100 or 200 meters higher. The plateau {{in the region}} of Le <b>Clapier,</b> which dates from the Sinemurian age, is very stony and has many low walls and heaps of stones, hence the name as [...] "clapier" [...] is a French word for an {{accumulation}} of stones in Occitania. Along the slope of Larzac is a thick layer of black marlstones which date from the Toarcian age. It is streaked due to linear erosion and marl may be found in the local prairies. The edge of Larzac (also called the Western Guillhaumard) is made of large white limestone cliffs dating from the Bathonian age. The marns are rich in fossils of marine animals such as Ammonoidea and Belemnoidea. Also, the valley of the Sorgue close to Larzac reveals sediments dating {{as far back as the}} Cambrian Series 2. The village is located on the Mediterranean side of the Atlantic and Mediterranean watershed.|$|E
5000|$|A {{few years}} later, a friend {{suggested}} {{to test this}} theory with an actual elephant. Hoyte wrote letters to the British consuls in Lyon, France, Geneva, Switzerland, and Turin, enquiring {{about the possibility of}} obtaining an elephant for the experiment, but without a serious expectation of success. However, the Turin Zoo had just acquired a female Asian elephant, Jumbo, who was trained as a circus animal. The owner of the zoo volunteered Jumbo and became the first sponsor of the expedition. Hoyte put together a team of 8 people, including Richard Jolly as the expedition secretary and Colonel John Hickman, Lecturer (later Reader) in Veterinary Surgery at the University of Cambridge Veterinary School, who had gained experience with elephants during World War II in Burma. The group obtained insurance for Jumbo from Lloyd's of London and further sponsorship from Life magazine, which later published a 7-page photo report.The expedition started in late July 1959 in Montmelian, France. It followed the valley of the Arc river and then ascended towards the Col de <b>Clapier.</b> However, the route up to the pass had become narrowed and dangerous due to rockfall. The group retracted down into the valley and crossed the Col du Mont Cenis, another pass suggested for Hannibal's route by none less than French emperor Napoleon.
