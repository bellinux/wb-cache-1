25|$|There are two independent, {{fast-acting}} safety {{shutdown systems}} as well. Shutoff rods are held above the reactor by electromagnets, and drop under gravity {{into the core}} to quickly end criticality. This system works even {{in the event of}} a complete power failure, as the electromagnets only hold the rods out of the reactor when power is available. A secondary system injects a high-pressure gadolinium nitrate neutron absorber solution into the <b>calandria.</b>|$|E
25|$|In CANDU {{the fuel}} bundles are instead {{contained}} in much smaller metal tubes about 10cm diameter. The tubes are then {{contained in a}} larger vessel containing additional heavy water acting purely as a moderator. This vessel, known as a <b>calandria,</b> is not pressurized and remains at much lower temperatures, making {{it much easier to}} fabricate. In order to prevent the heat from the pressure tubes leaking into the surrounding moderator, each fuel tube is enclosed in a second tube. Carbon dioxide gas in the gap between the two tubes acts as an insulator. The moderator tank also acts as a large heat sink that provides an additional safety feature.|$|E
25|$|The fuel {{channels}} {{can only}} maintain criticality {{if they are}} mechanically sound. If {{the temperature of the}} fuel bundles increases {{to the point where they}} are mechanically unstable, their horizontal layout means they will bend under gravity, shifting the layout of the bundles and reducing the efficiency of the reactions. Because the original fuel arrangement is optimum for a chain reaction and the natural uranium fuel has little excess reactivity, any significant deformation will stop the inter-fuel pellet fission reaction. This will not stop heat production from fission product decay, which would continue to supply a considerable heat output. If this process further weakens the fuel bundles, they will eventually bend far enough to touch the <b>calandria</b> tube, allowing heat to be efficiently transferred into the moderator tank. The moderator vessel has a considerable thermal capability on its own, and is normally kept relatively cool.|$|E
50|$|Thermosyphon {{reboilers}} (Image 2) do {{not require}} pumping of the column bottoms liquid into the reboiler. Natural circulation is obtained by using the density difference between the reboiler inlet column bottoms liquid and the reboiler outlet liquid-vapor mixture to provide sufficient liquid head to deliver the tower bottoms into the reboiler. Thermosyphon reboilers (also known as <b>calandrias)</b> are more complex than kettle reboilers and require more attention from the plant operators. There are many types of thermosyphon reboilers including vertical, horizontal, once-through or recirculating.|$|R

40|$|ROBERT EVAPORATORS in Australian sugar {{factories}} are traditionally constructed with 44. 45 mm outside diameter stainless steel tubes of ~ 2 m length for {{all stages of}} evaporation. There are a few vessels with longer tubes (up to 2. 8 m) and smaller and larger diameters (38. 1 and 50. 8 mm). Queensland University of Technology is undertaking a study to investigate the heat transfer performance of tubes of different lengths and diameters for {{the whole range of}} process conditions typically encountered in the evaporator set. Incorporation of these results into practical evaporator designs requires an understanding of the cost implications for constructing evaporator vessels with <b>calandrias</b> having tubes of different dimensions. Cost savings are expected for tubes of smaller diameter and longer length in terms of material, labour and installation costs in the factory. However these savings must be considered in terms of the heat transfer area requirements for the evaporation duty, which will likely be a function of the tube dimensions. In this paper a capital cost model is described which provides a relative cost of constructing and installing Robert evaporators of the same heating surface area but with different tube dimensions. Evaporators of 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 m 2 are investigated. This model will be used in conjunction with the heat transfer efficiency data (when available) to determine the optimum tube dimensions for a new evaporator at a specified evaporation duty. Consideration is also given to other factors such as juice residence time (and implications for sucrose degradation and control) and droplet de-entrainment in evaporators of different tube dimensions...|$|R
2500|$|Normally {{the rate}} of fission is {{controlled}} by light-water compartments called liquid zone controllers, which absorb excess neutrons, and by adjuster rods which can be raised or lowered in the core to control the neutron flux. These are used for normal operation, allowing the controllers to adjust reactivity across the fuel mass as different portions would normally burn at different rates depending on their position. The adjuster rods {{can also be used}} to slow or stop criticality. Because these rods are inserted into the low-pressure <b>calandria,</b> not the high-pressure fuel tubes, they would not be [...] "ejected" [...] by steam, a design issue for many pressurized-water reactors.|$|E
2500|$|CANDU designs have a {{positive}} void coefficient {{as well as a}} small power coefficient, normally considered bad in reactor design. This implies that steam generated in the coolant will increase the reaction rate, which in turn would generate more steam. This {{is one of the many}} reasons for the cooler mass of moderator in the [...] <b>calandria,</b> as even a serious steam incident in the core would not have a major impact on the overall moderation cycle. Only if the moderator itself starts to boil would there be any significant effect, and the large thermal mass ensures this will occur slowly. The deliberately [...] "sluggish" [...] response of the fission process in CANDU allows controllers more time to diagnose and deal with problems.|$|E
2500|$|On December 12, 1952 {{one of the}} world's {{first major}} reactor {{accidents}} occurred in the NRX reactor at AECL's Chalk River Laboratories, when a combination of human and mechanical error led to a temporary loss {{of control over the}} reactor's power level. Undercooling of the fuel channels led to a partial meltdown. This caused a hydrogen-oxygen explosion inside the <b>calandria.</b> Several fuel bundles experienced melting and ruptured, rendering much of the core interior unusable. The reactor building was contaminated, as well as an area of the Chalk River site, and millions of gallons of radioactive water accumulated in the reactor basement. This water was pumped to a waste management area of the Laboratories and monitored. Hundreds of military personnel from Canada and the U.S. (including naval officer and later U.S. President, LT James [...] "Jimmy" [...] Carter) were employed in the cleanup and disposal of the reactor debris.|$|E
40|$|Reactors {{with heavy}} water {{coolants}} and moderators {{have been used}} extensively in today's power industry. Monitoring of the moderator condition {{plays an important role}} in ensuring normal operation of a power plant. A cellular neural network, the architecture of which has been adapted for hardware implementation, is proposed for use in a system for prediction of the heavy water moderator temperature. A reactor model composed in accordance with the CANDU Darlington heavy water reactor design was used to form the training sample collection and to control correct operation of the neural network structure. The sample components for the adjustment and configuration of the network topology include key parameters that characterize the energy generation process in the core. The paper considers the feasibility of the temperature prediction only for the <b>calandria's</b> central cross-section. To solve this problem, the cellular neural network architecture has been designed, and major parts of the digital computational element and methods for their implementation based on an FPLD have also been developed. The method is described for organizing an optical coupling between individual neural modules within the network, which enables not only the restructuring of the topology in the training process, but also the assignment of priorities for the propagation of the information signals of neurons depending on the activity in a situation analysis at the neural network structure inlet. Asynchronous activation of cells was used based on an oscillating fractal network, the basis for which was a modified ring oscillator. The efficiency of training the proposed architecture using stochastic diffusion search algorithms is evaluated. A comparative analysis of the model behavior and the results of the neural network operation have shown that the use of the neural network approach is effective in safety systems of power plants...|$|R
2500|$|The main {{advantage}} of heavy water moderator over light {{water is the}} reduced absorption of the neutrons that sustain the chain reaction, allowing a lower concentration of active atoms (to the point of using unenriched natural uranium fuel). Deuterium ("heavy hydrogen") already has the extra neutron that light hydrogen would absorb, reducing the tendency to capture neutrons. Deuterium is twice the mass of a single neutron (vs light hydrogen {{which is about the}} same mass); the mismatch means more collisions are needed to moderate the neutrons, requiring a larger thickness of moderator between the fuel rods. This increases the size of the reactor core and the leakage of neutrons. It is also the practical reason for the <b>calandria</b> design, otherwise, a very large pressure vessel would be needed. The low 235U density in natural uranium also implies that less of the fuel will be consumed before the fission rate drops too low to sustain criticality, because the ratio of 235U to fission products+238U is lower. In CANDU most of the moderator is at lower temperatures than in other designs, reducing the spread of speeds and the overall speed of the moderator particles. This means most of the neutrons will end up at a lower energy and be more likely to cause fission, so CANDU not only [...] "burns" [...] natural uranium, but it does so more effectively as well. Overall, CANDU reactors use 30–40% less mined uranium than light-water reactors per unit of electricity produced. This is a major advantage to the heavy water design; it not only requires less fuel, but as the fuel {{does not have to be}} enriched, it is much less expensive as well.|$|E
60|$|A mocking-bird (Mimus orpheus), {{called by}} the {{inhabitants}} <b>Calandria,</b> is remarkable, from possessing a song far superior to {{that of any other}} bird in the country: indeed, it is nearly the only bird in South America which I have observed to take its stand for the purpose of singing. The song may be compared to that of the Sedge warbler, but is more powerful; some harsh notes and some very high ones, being mingled with a pleasant warbling. It is heard only during the spring. At other times its cry is harsh and far from harmonious. Near Maldonado these birds were tame and bold; they constantly attended the country houses in numbers, to pick the meat which was hung up on the posts or walls: if any other small bird joined the feast, the <b>Calandria</b> soon chased it away. On the wide uninhabited plains of Patagonia another closely allied species, O. Patagonica of d'Orbigny, which frequents the valleys clothed with spiny bushes, is a wilder bird, and has a slightly different tone of voice. It appears to me a curious circumstance, as showing the fine shades of difference in habits, that judging from this latter respect alone, when I first saw this second species, I thought it was different from the Maldonado kind. Having afterwards procured a specimen, and comparing the two without particular care, they appeared so very similar, that I changed my opinion; but now Mr. Gould says that they are certainly distinct; a conclusion in conformity with the trifling difference of habit, of which, however, he was not aware.|$|E

50|$|The coolant greatly reduces its density {{at the end}} of the core, {{resulting}} in a need to place extra moderator there. A LWR type SCWR design adopts water rods in the fuel assemblies. Most designs of CANDU type SCWR use an internal <b>calandria</b> where part of the feedwater flow is guided through top tubes through the core, that provide the added moderation (feedwater) in that region. This has the added advantage of being able to cool the entire vessel wall with feedwater, but results in a complex and materially demanding (high temperature, high temperature differences, high radiation) internal <b>calandria</b> and plena arrangement. Again a pressure-tube design has potentially fewer issues, as most of the moderator is in the <b>calandria</b> at low temperature and pressure, reducing the coolant density effect on moderation, and the actual pressure tube can be kept cool by the <b>calandria</b> water.|$|E
