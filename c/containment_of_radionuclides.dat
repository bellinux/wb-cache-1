Safe <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b> from spent {{nuclear fuel}} in {{geological}} disposal for hundred thousands of years, which may cover the period of glaciation, requires analysis of material behaviour of fuel containers under ice-age loads. The primary approach to prevent container failure is to determine critical defects {{and the elimination of}} such manufacturing defects identified by means of non-destructive examination. The results of the immersion ultrasonic techniques over a range of frequencies from 1 to 5 MHz, which was used to identify microstructure defects in a section of a real container made of ductile cast iron within the Swedish KBS 3, are reviewed. The ability of the method to detect slag inclusions and cracks is examined and the limitations of the technique in the case the large components with complex geometry are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Waste {{packages}} for a US nuclear waste repository {{are required to}} provide reasonable assurance of maintaining substantially complete <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b> for 300 to 1000 years after closure. The waiting time to failure for complex failure processes affecting engineered or manufactured systems is often found to be an exponentially-distributed random variable. Assuming that this simple distribution {{can be used to}} describe the behavior of a hypothetical single barrier waste package, calculations presented in this paper show that the mean time to failure (the only parameter needed to completely specify an exponential distribution) would have to be more than 10 {sub 7 } years in order to provide reasonable assurance of meeting this requirement. With two independent barriers, each would need to have a mean time to failure of only 10 {sup 5 } years to provide the same reliability. Other examples illustrate how multiple barriers can provide a strategy for not only achieving but demonstrating regulatory compliance...|$|E
40|$|The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in {{southeast}} New Mexico {{has been studied}} as a transuranic waste repository for the past 23 years. During this time, an extensive site characterization, design, construction, and experimental program was completed to provide in-depth understanding of the dominant processes that {{are most likely to}} influence the <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b> for 10, 000 years. The success of the program, however, is defined by the regulator in the context of compliance with performance criteria, rather than by the in-depth technical understanding typical of most scientific programs. The WIPP project was successful in making a transformation from science to compliance by refocusing and redirecting programmatic efforts toward the singular goal of meeting regulatory compliance requirements while accelerating the submittal of the Compliance Certification Application (CCA) by two months from the April 1994 Disposal Decision Plan (DDP) date of December 1996, and by reducing projected characterization costs by more than 40 %.

Total Systems Performance Assessment (TSPA) analysis has indicated that among the major radionuclides contributing to dose are technetium, iodine, and neptunium, all of which are highly mobile in the environment. <b>Containment</b> <b>of</b> these <b>radionuclides</b> within the repository is a priority for the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP).

40|$|Radionuclide {{transport}} from a contaminant {{source to}} groundwater and surface {{water is a}} common problem faced by most US Department of Energy (DOE) facilities. <b>Containment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>radionuclide</b> plume, including strontium- 90 and uranium, is possible using phosphate treatment as a chemical stabilizer. Such a chemical process occurs in soils under natural environmental conditions. Therefore, the concept of phosphate amendment for radiostrontium and uranium immobilization is already a proven principle. In this presentation, results of bench-scale experiments {{and the concept of}} a field-scale demonstration are discussed. The phosphate treatment is possible at the source or near the advancing contaminant plume.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this task {{is to determine the}} principal oxidation state (redox) species of select elements in samples of groundwater in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain (YM), which is being evaluated as a site for geologic storage of the nation’s spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste. Samples to be analyzed include, but are not limited to, groundwater from wells of the Nye County Early Warning Drilling Program. Elements to be studied include arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), selenium (Se), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), vanadium (V), tungsten (W), rhenium (Re), and uranium (U). The purpose is to develop a more accurate and complete description of the redox properties of YM-related groundwater, which influences the solubility and consequently the transport of radionuclides. Indeed, a possible natural barrier to radionuclide migration in the saturated zone (SZ) is the presence of non-oxidizing or reducing environments. For example, the mobility of Tc- 99 in oxic groundwater, ascribed to the pertechnetate ion, is greatly diminished in reducing groundwater. The <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b> away from the accessible environment is a key feature in the Yucca Mountain performance assessment...|$|E
30|$|To ensure {{sustainability}} {{of the nuclear}} technology, the use of eco-friendly nuclear waste isolation methods and development of cost-effective methods for in situ <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b> are gaining importance. There has been a growing interest to study the interaction of microorganisms with radionuclides which are largely created by anthropogenic nuclear reactions. Emphasis is on the environmental microbes isolated from metal/radionuclide enriched sites {{in the context of}} nuclear waste disposal (Neu et al. 2010). Previously, Arthrobacter sp. strain KMSZP 6 had revealed extraordinary tolerance to radionuclide like U (VI) and heavy metals like Cu (II), Pb (II) and Cd (II) and showed the presence of metal detoxification determinants like PIB-Type ATPase and phosphatase (Kumar et al. 2012, 2013 a). By expressing high tolerance and sequestration abilities for cesium and strontium and high radiation tolerance, KMSZP 6 strain presents its suitability for bioremediation of nuclear waste. The current investigation provides important information on acclimation of a naturally soil-dwelling bacterium to metal enriched environment resulting in emergence of a highly metal-resistant strain, well adapted to harsh and anthropogenic environment. Future studies are directed towards screening of transporters for Sr 2 + and Cs+ in this strain for gaining in depth understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to its survival in environment enriched with heavy metals and radionuclides.|$|E

During this time, an extensive site characterization, design, construction, and experimental program was completed, which provided in depth understanding of the dominant processes that {{are most likely to}} influence the <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b> for 10, 000 years. Nearly 1, 500 parameters were developed using information gathered from this program and were input to numerical models for WIPP Compliance Certification Application (CCA) Performance Assessment (PA) calculations. The CCA probability models require input parameters that are defined by a statistical distribution. Developing parameters begins with the assignment of an appropriate distribution type, which is dependent on the type, magnitude, and volume of data or information available. Parameter development may require interpretation or statistical analysis of raw data, combining raw data with literature values, scaling laboratory or field data to fit code grid mesh sizes, or other transformations. Documentation of parameter development is designed to answer two questions: What source information was used to develop this parameter? and Why was this particular data set/information used? Therefore, complete documentation requires integrating information from code sponsors, parameter task leaders, performance assessment analysts, and experimental principal investigators. This paper, Part 2 of 2 parts, contains a discussion of the WIPP CCA PA Parameter Tracking System, document traceability and retrievability, and lessons learned from related audits and reviews...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{provisions}} of the 1991 French radioactive waste management law, various fuel cycle scenarios will be assessed and compared in terms of feasibility, flexibility, cost, and ultimate waste radiotoxic inventory. The latter criterion may be further broken down into “potential radiotoxic inventory ” (the radiotoxic inventory <b>of</b> all the <b>radionuclides</b> produced) and “residual radiotoxic inventory ” (the radionuclide fraction reaching the biosphere after migration from the repository).

40|$|General Atomics (GA) has {{recently}} completed a Phase I program {{for the development of}} a two-step alternative to incineration for the destruction of organics in transuranic wastes at the Savannah River Site. This process is known as thermal desorption-supercritical water oxidation, or TD-SCWO. The GA TD process uses heat to volatilize and transport organics from the waste material for subsequent treatment by SCWO. SCWO oxidizes organics in a steam medium at elevated temperatures and pressures in a manner that achieves excellent destruction efficiencies and compliance with all environmental requirements without the need for complex pollution-abatement equipment. This application of TD-SCWO is focused on a full-scale batch process for 55 -gallon drums of mixed transuranic waste at the Savannah River Site. The Phase I reduced-scale test results show that the process operates as intended on surrogate waste matrices chosen to be representative of Savannah River Site transuranic mixed wastes. It provides a high degree of hydrogen removal and full <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>radionuclide</b> surrogate, with minimal requirements for pre-treatment and post-treatment. Other test objectives were to verify that the process produces no dioxins or furans, and meets all applicable regulatory criteria for retention of toxic metals, particulate, and criteria pollutants, while meeting WIPP/WAC and TRUPACT-II requirements. Thermal desorption of surrogate SRS mixed wastes at 500 psi and 1000 F met all tested requirements for WIPP/WAC and TRUPACT-II. SCWO of the desorbed surrogate organic materials at 500 psi and 1500 F also appears to meet all requirements for a nonincineration alternative, although > 99. 99 % DRE for chlorinated solvents has not yet been demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Using deep {{boreholes}} for {{the final}} disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLRW) {{can take advantage of}} multiple geologic barriers as safety features and aims for the safe <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b> by containment-providing rock zones (CPRZ). The great depth efficiently prolongs or hinders radionuclide transport and also impedes proliferation. Finally, there may be a time benefit with regard to technical implementation and costs. Due to the phase-out from nuclear energy in Germany the number of boreholes could be less than 100. A simplified, generic safety concept, and the requirements for the diameter of boreholes and containers are derived in this paper. Furthermore, the operational safety of emplacement, the retrieval of waste and sealing of the boreholes is discussed. It is outlined that boreholes can be sealed quickly and over long distances with proven technologies, for example, using the creep properties of salt rock formations. This concept is assessed for its compliance with the safety requirements of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB), and the requirements and criteria for site selection defined by the German commission on “Storage of high-level radioactive waste”. The retrievability of HLRW is assessed to be technically feasible based on today´s knowledge, but recoverability after closure cannot be guaranteed for long time spans. Further developments in details of the concept of deep borehole disposal (DBD), a demonstration of its technical feasibility and an assessment of operational and long-term safety are still necessary to make DBD an approved option...|$|E
40|$|The empty {{interior}} cavity of fullerenes {{has long}} been touted for <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b> during in vivo transport, during radioimmunotherapy (RIT) and radioimaging for example. As the chemistry required to open a hole in fullerene is complex and exceedingly unlikely to occur in vivo, and conformational stability of the fullerene cage is absolute, atoms trapped within fullerenes can only be released during extremely energetic events. Encapsulating radionuclides in fullerenes could therefore potentially eliminate undesired toxicity resulting from leakage and catabolism of radionuclides administered with other techniques. At {{the start of this}} project however, methods for production of transition metal and p-electron metal endohedral fullerenes were completely unknown, and only one method for production of endohedral radiofullerenes was known. They therefore investigated three different methods for the production of therapeutically useful endohedral metallofullerenes: (1) implantation of ions using the high intensity ion beam at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Surface Modification and Characterization Research Center (SMAC) and fullerenes as the target; (2) implantation of ions using the recoil energy following alpha decay; and (3) implantation of ions using the recoil energy following neutron capture, using ORNL's High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) as a thermal neutron source. While they were unable to obtain evidence of successful implantation using the ion beam at SMAC, recoil following alpha decay and neutron capture were both found to be economically viable methods for the production of therapeutically useful radiofullerenes. In this report, the procedures for preparing fullerenes containing the isotopes {sup 212 }Pb, {sup 212 }Bi, {sup 213 }Bi, and {sup 177 }Lu are described. None of these endohedral fullerenes had ever previously been prepared, and all of these radioisotopes are actively under investigation for RIT. Additionally, the chemistry for derivatizing the radiofullerenes for water-solubility and a method for removing exohedral radionuclides are reported. The methods and chemistry developed during this CRADA are the crucial first steps for the development of fullerenes as a method superior to existing technologies for in vivo transport of radionuclides...|$|E
