5000|$|The {{corps of}} translators {{struggled}} with their monumental task of rendering each day's deliberations into both languages. Martí notes {{that at the}} beginning the Spanish of the daily minutes was [...] "miserable", but by late January 1890 was [...] "fluid and elegant". The oral interpretation of speeches, especially when they became heated, was more difficult. There were, of course, no electronic facilities for simultaneous interpretation, as we would expect in any international <b>conference</b> <b>today.</b> Thus, any speech had to be interpreted consecutively into the other working language after the delegate finished. This was a lengthy and taxing process, and delegates who did speak both languages frequently would interrupt the interpreter to make corrections or points of order, further adding to the confusion. Some of the sessions became quite intense, with delegates speaking forcefully to each other. In these situations the interpreters frequently fell behind {{and the result was}} linguistic and diplomatic anarchy.|$|E
