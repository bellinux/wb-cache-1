The vertical stress was calculated using both the original density and <b>corrected</b> <b>density</b> and plotted against depth to show variation (Fig.  5). The figure shows a vertical stress gradient using the original density of 0.9949 psi/ft, which represents 8159.29 psi, against a vertical stress gradient obtained from the <b>corrected</b> <b>density</b> log of 0.9887 psi/ft or 8108.44 psi; yielding a difference of 50 psi. Although this value may seem trivial, it may have {{a great impact on}} the limits of the mud window prediction since the vertical stress is incorporated in the empirical calculations of pore pressure gradient and fracture gradient. This could in turn have a domino effect on wellbore stability and the cost associated with it.|$|E
