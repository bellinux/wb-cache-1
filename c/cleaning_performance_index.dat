40|$|Future {{upgrades}} of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) demand improved <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> of its collimation system. Very efficient collimation {{is required}} during regular operations at high intensities, because {{even a small}} amount of energy deposited on superconducting magnets can cause an abrupt loss of superconducting conditions (quench). The possibility to use a crystal-based collimation system represents an option for improving both <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> and impedance compared to the present system. Before relying on crystal collimation for the LHC, a demonstration under LHC conditions (energy, beam parameters, etc.) and a comparison against the present system is considered mandatory. Thus, a prototype crystal collimation system has been designed and installed in the LHC during the Long Shutdown 1 (LS 1), to perform feasibility tests during the Run  2 at energies up to 6. 5  TeV. The layout is suitable for operation with proton as well as heavy ion beams. In this paper, the design constraints and the solutions proposed for this test stand for feasibility demonstration of crystal collimation at the LHC are presented. The expected <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> achievable with this test stand, as assessed in simulations, is presented and compared to that of the present LHC collimation system. The first experimental observation of crystal channeling in the LHC at the record beam energy of 6. 5  TeV has been obtained in 2015 using the layout presented (Scandale et al., Phys Lett B 758 : 129, 2016).

40|$|Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and rubisco protein stain {{were used}} as tools to screen the {{effectiveness}} of detergent formulations in cleaning a protein stain from solid surfaces. Surfactant and biosurfactant-based formulations, with and without added protease, were screened for <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance.</b> Enzyme-free detergent formulations at 1500 ppm total surfactant were insufficient to cause complete surface cleaning, despite the high concentration of surfactant. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> of a "home-made" formulation containing 2 ppm subtilisin A (SA) and 2 ppm sodium dodecyl benzyl sulphonate (SDOBS) was as efficient as the best amongst the three enzyme-free 1500 ppm formulations. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> of 2 ppm SA {{in the absence of}} SDOBS was less effective than the combined formulation, even though 2 ppm SDOBS alone did not cause any protein removal. The observed synergistic performance was attributed to the cooperative mechanisms (chemical and physical attack) by which these two agents act on a rubisco stain. Replacing SDOBS in the enzyme-surfactant formulation with the same amount of surfactin biosurfactant (2 ppm) gave the best rubisco removal of all formulations examined in this study, irrespective of the surface chemistry underlying the protein film. It was found that 75 % and 80 % of immobilised rubisco stain could be removed from hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, respectively, by the biosurfactant-SA formulation (compared with 60 % and 65 %, respectively, using the SDOBS-SA formulation).

40|$|Aim: In this {{in-vitro}} {{study the}} <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> of a dishwasher for cleaning removable orthodontic appliances was evaluated. Materials and methods: 140 acrylic resin specimens (Orthocryl) were produced according to manufacturer’s instructions: 20 for the pre-tests, 10 stained and 10 unstained for each dishwashing detergent (K Classic Geschirr-Reiniger-Pulver and Sodasan Maschinenspülmittel with corresponding rinse agent and dishwasher salt, Somat 10 Spülmaschinentabs) and each cleaning programme (short programme, 40 °C; intensive programme, 75 °C). Subsequent to sanding and polishing the specimens to a thickness of 1 ± 0. 1 mm, they were stained {{in accordance to}} the method of Jagger et al. (2002) {{with a combination of}} black-tea solution, 0. 2 % chlorhexidine and saliva as a plaque-substitute. The optical density of each specimen was determined before and after staining and after cleaning in the dishwasher. All measurements were done, using a spectrophotometer at 380 nm, the absorption maximum of the stains. In addition, in each series 10 unstained specimens were used {{in order to determine the}} average opacity caused by the cleaning as such, which was subtracted from the values measured for the stained specimens. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> was expressed as a percentage of removed tea-chlorhexidine-salvia-stains (absorption) in relation to the total stain (absorption). The results were analysed for significant differences, using the Kruskal-Wallis- and Mann-Whitney-test. Results: All specimens showed less tea-chlorhexidine-saliva-stains after the <b>cleaning.</b> The <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> was always significantly higher using the intensive programme. Only the short programme yielded significant differences for the tested detergents with K Classic Geschirr-Reiniger-Pulver being the most effective (median: 97. 65 %). Sodasan Maschinenspülmittel was the by far least effective product (median: 33. 11 %). No clinically relevant dimensional changes were measured after the cleaning in any case. Conclusions: The study shows that the cleaning of acrylic resin specimens in a dishwasher yielded good results. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> of this method is comparable to the results of chemical cleaning tablets mentioned in literature. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> depends on the programme and the dishwashing detergent.
