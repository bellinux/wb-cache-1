He was subsequently handed the number 9 shirt, formerly worn by Newcastle legend Alan Shearer. On 5 February, Cissé made his debut for Newcastle in the 2-1 league win against Aston Villa at St James' Park. He replaced the injured Leon Best in the 14th minute before scoring the winning goal in the 71st minute with a breath-taking volley, <b>chesting</b> it before volleying with his left into the top left corner of the net. On 11 February, he made his first start for the club in the 5-0 away league defeat against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. On 25 February, he scored in the sixth minute in a 2-2 home draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers.

50|$|The 23-year-old Sangju Sangmu forward rose highest {{to reach}} Kim Jin-su's free kick from {{close to the}} right touchline before Hassan could punch clear, the header sending the Korean fans amongst the 36,053 crowd into raptures in the 20th minute. South Korea had been {{dominant}} {{in the first half}} but, with six minutes remaining in the half, Iraq finally had a sight of goal. Ahmed Yasin sent his long-range attempt well over the bar while, two minutes ahead of the break, Kalaf forced Kim Jin-hyeon to drop to his right to push a low shot away for a corner. Five minutes after the restart, however, the Koreans all but put the game to bed. Lee Jung-hyup was involved again, this time <b>chesting</b> the ball {{down on the edge of}} the area into the path of defender Kim Young-gwon and the Guangzhou Evergrande man's bouncing left footed shot skidded past Hassan and into the corner of the goal. Ki Sung-yueng and Son Heung-min both tried their luck unsuccessfully from long range soon after, before the increasingly desperate Iraqis started pumping the ball long towards captain Mahmoud. But the veteran could not find a way past a Korean defence that has yet to concede a goal at the tournament, and the Taeguk Warriors sealed their long-awaited place in the final of the continental championship.|$|E
5000|$|United States vs Ghana {{was played}} on 26 June 2010 at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg. The match was watched by 19 million Americans, {{making it the}} most watched {{association}} football match in American television history. The match was won by Ghana in extra time, after Asamoah Gyan broke a 1-1 deadlock. Kevin-Prince Boateng scored the opening goal of the match for Ghana in the 5th minute. The goal followed an error by Ricardo Clark, who lost the ball to Ghana in midfield. Boateng took {{the ball to the}} edge of the penalty area, beating US goalkeeper Tim Howard with a low left foot shot. Landon Donovan equalised with a penalty kick in the 62nd minute, awarded after Jonathan Mensah fouled Clint Dempsey. The US had chances to win the game thereafter, but they were unable to get past Ghana's goalkeeper Richard Kingson. The match thus went to extra time. In the third minute, Gyan latched onto a high long ball, <b>chesting</b> it down and holding off two defenders before scoring the winner. After the match, Ghana's coach Milovan Rajevac hailed his side's achievement in becoming one of the [...] "best eight teams in the world", but regretted the number of players that would miss the quarter-final against Uruguay because of injury or suspension. The president of the Soccer Federation, Sunil Gulati, lamented the team's failure to make the quarter-finals and thereby further raise the profile of the sport in the US.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND The aim of {{the study}} is to {{determine}} the utility of <b>chest</b> sonography in common paediatric diseases and to present <b>chest</b> sonography images with possible explanation for the same. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study was conducted in Department of Paediatric Medicine, Bharati Medical College, Sangli. The patients admitted in paediatric ward, NICU, PICU with respiratory complaints and findings were subjected to <b>chest</b> sonography after <b>chest</b> x-ray. The <b>chest</b> sonography images were interpreted and an attempt was made to correlate with findings of <b>chest</b> xray. The information given by <b>chest</b> sonography was analysed and possible cause of image was evaluated. RESULTS The <b>chest</b> sonography appearances were found to be specific and in certain instances more informative than <b>chest</b> x-ray. It can differentiate between collapse and consolidation easily. The limitation of <b>chest</b> sonography was- it can assess only peripheral lung regions with inability to assess deeper lesions, especially with aerated peripheral lung. CONCLUSION The <b>chest</b> sonography is superior to <b>chest</b> x-ray in diagnosing minimal effusion and minimal pneumothorax. Also, when there is difficulty in differentiating pulmonary from pleural pathology. Though, <b>chest</b> sonography cannot replace <b>chest</b> x-ray, it is very useful additional investigation and often times very helpful with additional diagnostic information...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{computed}} tomography and <b>chest</b> X-ray in the diagnosis of rib fractures in patients with blunt <b>chest</b> trauma. Materials and Methods: A total of 83 patients with blunt <b>chest</b> trauma who were treated in three hospitals between May 2010 and June 2011 and who had received both <b>chest</b> computed tomography scan and <b>chest</b> X-ray as part of their initial assessment were included in the study. Results: The number of rib fractures was 2. 15 ± 2. 12 on <b>chest</b> X-ray, however, on <b>chest</b> computed tomography the number was 3. 75 ± 2. 35. There was a significant difference between the <b>chest</b> X-ray and the computed tomography (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Chest computed tomography is the best and a significantly more sensitive radiological method than <b>chest</b> X-ray in the detection of rib fracture, and it should be routinely used in the initial assessment of <b>chest</b> trauma.

40|$|Background: Although many {{patients}} who experience <b>chest</b> pain or pressure consult their physicians, unfortunately {{a large number}} of them do not, and consequently they remain undiagnosed and untreated. Chest pain, in a subset of these patients, may be relieved with a bronchodilator or other asthma drugs. Methods: This retrospective study included twenty cases of <b>chest</b> pain that were relieved with asthma drugs. Chest pain was categorized into three types: <b>chest</b> pain variant asthma, bronchial asthma with <b>chest</b> pain, and non-asthmatic allergic <b>chest</b> pain. Chest pain variant asthma was defined as <b>chest</b> pressure that improved in response to a bronchodilator, without the characteristic attacks of bronchial asthma. Bronchial asthma with <b>chest</b> pain was defined as <b>chest</b> pressure, with the characteristic attacks of bronchial asthma that improved following the administration of a leukotriene receptor antagonist, systemic corticosteroid, or bronchodilator. Non-asthmatic allergic <b>chest</b> pain was defined as <b>chest</b> pressure without the typical asthma attack, but with <b>chest</b> pressure that improved in response to a leukotriene receptor antagonist or systemic corticosteroid, but not a bronchodilator. Results: Fourteen cases of <b>chest</b> pain were diagnosed as variant asthma, three cases were diagnosed as bronchial asthma with <b>chest</b> pain, and three cases were diagnosed as non-asthmatic allergic <b>chest</b> pain. Conclusions: The results suggest that the mechanism underlying <b>chest</b> pain that is relieved with asthma drugs can involve either an airway constriction pathway or a non-constrictive pathway presumably airway inflammation. Analysis of the patient's response to treatment with asthma medication is useful for the correct diagnosis of the source of <b>chest</b> pain...|$|R

MethodsFrom June 2009 to February 2012, the <b>chest</b> posteroanterior radiographs of 156 patients with PSP (Group 1) were reviewed. Among another 3134 patients with PSP, we identified 52 patients who had a <b>chest</b> posteroanterior radiograph prior to the attack (Group 2).
