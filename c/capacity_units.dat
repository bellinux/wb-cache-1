40|$|Communication over a noisy {{channel is}} often {{conducted}} in a setting in which different input symbols to the channel incur a certain cost. For example, for the additive white Gaussian noise channel, the cost associated with a real number input symbol is the square of its magnitude. In such a setting, it is often useful to know {{the maximum amount of}} information that can be reliably transmitted per cost incurred. This is known as the <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost. In this paper, we generalize the <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost to various communication tasks involving a quantum channel; in particular, we consider classical communication, entanglement-assisted classical communication, private communication, and quantum communication. For each task, we define the corresponding <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost and derive a formula for it analogous to that of the usual capacity. Furthermore, for the special case {{in which there is a}} zero-cost quantum state, we obtain expressions for the various <b>capacities</b> per <b>unit</b> cost in terms of an optimized relative entropy involving the zero-cost state. For each communication task, we construct an explicit pulse-position-modulation coding scheme that achieves the <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost. Finally, we compute <b>capacities</b> per <b>unit</b> cost for various quantum Gaussian channels and introduce the notion of a blocklength-constrained <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost.

50|$|By 1904 {{motor bus}} {{services}} in country districts {{began to be}} a real cause of competition for the railway. The GWR was seeking methods of catering economically for light passenger traffic, using steam railcars. These consisted of a passenger coach into which was built a four-wheeled steam locomotive, duplicate driving controls being provided at the opposite end from the locomotive. The very limited power of the small traction unit was always an issue, and on the steeply graded Forest of Dean Railway section it proved impracticable. Instead higher <b>capacity</b> <b>units</b> known as auto-trains, consisting of a tank locomotive coupled to one or two coaches were used. The coach remote from the locomotive had driving controls and a mechanical linkage enabled the driver to operate the locomotive regulator. Some configurations marshalled an intermediate trailer between the driving trailer and the locomotive, and in the extreme this could be done both ends of the locomotive, giving four passenger coaches.|$|E
30|$|At the {{beginning}} of his engagement in 2008, the investor takes decisions on capacity adjustment at the three production locations that are continued from the initial configuration. Whereas technical and personnel capacity of both locations in Lahr und Hemer is extended (starting from 1 Mio. <b>capacity</b> <b>units</b> before the acquisition) during the planning horizon by 0.2 Mio. <b>capacity</b> <b>units</b> per year, capacity downsizing is chosen for the production location in Porta Westfalica (minus 0.2 Mio. <b>capacity</b> <b>units</b> per year). The latter adjustment lasts for 3  years until the location is liquidated {{at the end of the}} investor’s engagement (i.e., the end of 2010). According to the demand expected for the products offered by the sanitary supply chain, the investor decides to open a new distribution location in Volketswil with constant capacities (i.e., 2 Mio. <b>capacity</b> <b>units</b> are additionally available) at {{the beginning}} of 2008, which supplements the stagnating storage capacity (2 Mio. <b>capacity</b> <b>units)</b> of the existing distribution location in Porta Westfalica. Hence, the sanitary company is able to meet the demand at all markets in all time periods completely. For providing essential raw materials, the supplier in Plettenberg is to be used throughout the whole planning horizon. The deliveries are complemented by the supplier in Hettstedt during the year 2009.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Most of {{the studies}} on traffic {{grooming}} focus on minimizing network link capacity and providing serving-relationship between client services and link capacity. Subsequent to this step, {{it is important to}} plan for adding/dropping client services over client service ports and setting up end-to-end lightpaths over network ports, which is however seldom investigated. We call such effort node hardware module planning. This is an industrially practical problem aiming to minimize node hardware cost since hardware modules are the most expensive components in a network. Based on a link-based traffic grooming result that provides information on end-to-end <b>capacity</b> <b>units</b> incident to nodes and aggregation relationship between client services and <b>capacity</b> <b>units,</b> we develop an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to optimally plan hardware modules. To overcome the computation difficulty of the ILP model under large-sized planning scenarios, we also develop a fast sub-optimal heuristic for hardware module planning. Simulation studies indicate that the heuristic is efficient to achieve a design close to an optimal solution obtained by the ILP model. Also, the evaluation of the impact of switch backplane size shows that given a certain set of network modules, an optimal switch backplane size exists, which achieves the lowest hardware cost.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{capacity}} and <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost of Gaussian multiple access-channel (GMAC) with peak power constraints. We first devise an approach based on Blahut-Arimoto Algorithm to numerically optimize the sum rate and quantify the corresponding input distributions. The results reveal {{that in the}} case with identical peak power constraints, the user with higher SNR is to have a symmetric antipodal input distribution for all values of noise variance. Next, we analytically derive and characterize an achievable rate region for the capacity in cases with small peak power constraints, which coincides with the capacity in a certain scenario. The <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost is of interest in low power regimes and is a target performance measure in energy efficient communications. In this work, we derive the <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost of additive white Gaussian channel and GMAC with peak power constraints. The results in case of GMAC demonstrate that the <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost is obtained using antipodal signaling for both users and is independent of users rate ratio. We characterize the optimized transmission strategies obtained for capacity and <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost with peak-power constraint in detail and specifically in contrast to the settings with average-power constraints.
