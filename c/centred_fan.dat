This area is called Ståplatstorget ("The terracing square"), and includes eight vending stands and MFF Support's supporter centre. At the supporter <b>centre,</b> <b>fans</b> can buy souvenirs, and tickets to away matches. The square also contains publicly accessible benches and tables. Access between the {{different areas of the}} stadium was limited by a system of security gates {{until the end of the}} 2011 season, when Malmö FF announced that supporters would be able to roam the stadium freely, except for the areas occupied by away supporters. This was done to create a more free and friendly atmosphere, and to encourage fans to arrive earlier for matches.

Some viewed it as {{an important step in}} the team's rebuilding process, while others were outraged at the loss of a player who was adored within the community. That outrage was most palpable when a local Ottawa radio station suggested that Fisher's new wife Carrie Underwood was largely responsible for his move to Nashville, and subsequently banned the play of her music.

40|$|Pre- and post-storm {{topography}} and aerial photography, {{collected in}} regions where new washover fans were formed, were studied {{to determine the}} extent of morphologic, vegetative and anthropogenic control on washover shape and extent. When overwash is funnelled through a gap in a dune ridge and then spreads laterally on the back barrier, decelerating and depositing sediment, it forms washover fans. Fans were shown to primarily occur at pre-existing gaps in the foredune. During overwash, these gaps, or overwash throats, widened and deepened. The shape and extent of the fan was shown to depend on not only the pre-storm topography, but also the existence of beach tracks, roads and other anthropogenic influences and vegetation. The cross-shore overwash profile change model by Larson et al. and Donnelly et al. was modified to include pre-storm throat widths and a lateral spreading angle estimated from the pre-storm topography as inputs and tested using cross-shore profiles through the <b>fan</b> <b>centres.</b> These new inputs make the model more generalised, such that the calibrated model is applicable to a wider range of cross-shore profiles. © 2007 ASCE...|$|R

40|$|The non-classical gas {{dynamics}} of binary mixtures of organic fluids in the vapour phase is investigated {{for the first}} time. A predictive thermodynamic model is used to compute the relevant mixture properties, including its critical point coordinates and the local value of the fundamental derivative of {{gas dynamics}} Gamma. The considered model is the improved Peng-Robinson Stryjek-Vera cubic equation of state, complemented by the Wong-Sandler mixing rules. A finite thermodynamic region is found where the nonlinearity parameter Gamma is negative and therefore non-classical gas dynamics phenomena are admissible. A non-monotone dependence of Gamma on the mixture composition is observed {{in the case of}} binary mixtures of siloxane and perfluorocarbon fluids, with the minimum value of Gamma in the mixture being always larger than that of its more complex component. The observed dependence indicates that non-ideal mixing has a strong influence on the gas dynamics behaviour, either classical or non-classical, of the mixture. Numerical experiments of the supersonic expansion of a mixture flow around a sharp corner show the transition from the classical configuration, exhibiting an isentropic rarefaction <b>fan</b> <b>centred</b> at the expansion corner, to non-classical ones, including mixed expansion waves and rarefaction shock waves, if the mixture composition is changed...|$|R
40|$|Gate road {{development}} lies on {{the critical}} path in the longwall production process. To address this issue industry has invested substantial resources in developing technologies such as continuous haulage and bolting cycle automation. There has been limited focus on improvement of ancillary development processes and technologies such as the provision of face and panel services and the panel advance process. A monorail system has been in use for some years at Mandalong Mine near Lake Macquarie in N. S. W. The Macquarie Monorail system is an integrated gate road development services unit and differs from many existing monorail units employed in underground operations as {{it is designed to}} manage all face services while as well as carrying heavy panel plant such as the section load <b>centre</b> and auxiliary <b>fan.</b> Use of the system at the Mandalong Mine has resulted in increased productivity and safety performance during gate road development. Reductions in service move and operating delay times of 32 % and 25 % were observed respectively along with a 70 % reduction in manual handling injuries. The system is not without its disadvantages chief being significant manual handling is necessary in the erection of the relatively heavy monorail structure and replacement of the flexible ventilation ducting. Despite these minor limitations of the system, the overall safety and productivity performance of gate road development was found to be superior to conventional development units...|$|R
40|$|Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) {{was used}} to map the {{internal}} airflow of a domestic kitchen oven. Oven cooking performance is dependant on the airflow within the cavity. Previous flow measurement techniques such as hot wire anemometry and pitot probes are very time consuming and prone to error in the hot recirculating flow in an oven. The oven cavity, a commercially available mid-range oven, was modified for optical access. The PIV system consisted of a CCD camera, light sheet illumination from a pulsed Nd:YAG laser, and propanediol droplets and hollow glass spheres with a Stokes number of less than 0. 055. Experiments were conducted in an empty oven at room temperature and at 180 oC, and at 180 oC with a single cooking tray installed. Velocity fields were measured in seven adjacent, coplanar object planes each on four different planes in the oven. The velocity data was averaged to yield mean flow fields, and the seven coplanar data fields were subsequently collaged to produce a full cross-sectional velocity map for each oven plane. In the cold and hot empty cavity a single vortex <b>centred</b> on the <b>fan</b> axis was seen, with strong radial flow. The maximum measured velocity in the cold oven was 1. 8 ms- 1, which compared well with earlier hot-wire measurements. When a tray was introduced, the single vortex was replaced by three circulatory features. Shear flow was seen on both upper and lower sides of the tray, with a lower velocity and a stagnation point on the upper side...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to present an adaptive remeshing procedure for lower bound limit analysis with application to soil mechanics. Unlike conventional finite element meshes, a lower bound grid incorporates statically admissible stress discontinuities between adjacent elements. These discontinuities pen-nit large stress jumps over an infinitesimal distance and {{reduce the number of}} elements needed to predict the collapse load accurately. In general, the role of the discontinuities is crucial as their arrangement and distribution has a dramatic influence on the accuracy of the lower bound solution (Limit Analysis and Soil Plasticity, 1975). To ensure that the discontinuities are positioned in an optimal manner requires an error estimator and mesh adaptation strategy which accounts for the presence of stress singularities in the computed stress field. Recently, Borges et al. presented an anisotropic mesh adaptation strategy for a mixed limit analysis formulation which used a directional error estimator. In the present work, this strategy has been tailored to suit a discontinuous lower bound formulation which employs the stresses and body forces as primary unknowns. The adapted mesh has a maximum density of discontinuities {{in the direction of the}} maximum rate of change in the stress field. For problems involving strong stress singularities in the boundary conditions (e. g. a strip footing), the automatic generation of discontinuity <b>fans,</b> <b>centred</b> on the singular points, has been implemented. The efficiency of the proposed technique is demonstrated by analysis of two classical soil mechanics problems; namely the bearing capacity of a rigid strip footing and the collapse of a vertical cut...|$|R
40|$|External {{contamination}} of sprayers during {{the application of}} Plant Protection Products (PPP) {{can lead to a}} serious threat for operators and the environment. The residue of PPP stays often on the sprayer surfaces {{until the end of the}} spray season when the sprayer is cleaned for winter storage. The external loading of the sprayer with PPP can be a source for point source pollution and a risk for the operator when in contact with uncovered body parts. To quantify the external loading of PPP on a tractor and a sprayer when spraying an orchard samples were taken after 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 minutes of spraying. These times coincide with treated areas of 0. 25, 0. 50, 1, 2 and 4 ha of an apple orchard. Four repetitions were done in time spraying the fluorescent tracer Brilliant Sulpho Flavine. The amount of tracer on the tractor (back cabin screen, left/right cabin screen, front side top hood) and the sprayer (left/top/right side of tank at the front and middle of the sprayer, left/top/right side of <b>fan</b> house, <b>centre</b> back side <b>fan</b> inlet) parts were quantified. Spray deposit was measured using collectors attached to the sprayer and tractor surface, by wiping of 100 cm 2 surface area and by high pressure cleaning of the whole tractor and sprayer following ISO 22368 - 2. Results show a decrease in additional loading of the sprayer in time elapsed, suggesting saturation of the collectors and surface area.
