500|$|The subplot of Homer {{entering}} the childproofing business {{was inspired by}} an instance when a salesman visited Payne and his pregnant wife to see if their home was safe for children. In an interview with Star-News, Payne commented: [...] "You hire this person to come into your home to look for <b>changes</b> <b>you</b> can make. They {{make you feel like}} the most horrible person in the world and that your house is the temple of doom." [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] features a scene based specifically on this instance in which a saleswoman (voiced by cast member Tress MacNeille) selling childproofing items visits Homer and Marge and exaggerates the dangers in their home. NRBQ's song [...] "Always Safety First" [...] is played during a montage in the episode in which Homer is seen improving the safety of the infants of Springfield.|$|E

If we're talking about the 'new me,' that's it and why it's {{at the end of}} the record. You have to go through those things and make the <b>changes</b> <b>you</b> have to make and be there and go, 'Okay, I did it.' It doesn't come that easy. [...] I just didn't hold back this time, and writing that way has made me feel really purified, like I've actually gotten a chance to break through instead of just wallowing in all of my problems. It's not about all the times that I've been afraid and tormented and sad, it's about looking at those situations and stomping them out. It feels really good to sing these songs now." ...|$|E
500|$|Aaron Stewart-Ahn was {{selected}} to direct the video based on his previous work directing the video for Death Cab For Cutie's [...] "Stable Song", as well as work documenting the band's live performances. [...] Stewart-Ahn said that the theme of travel had been inspired by Death Cab for Cutie's earlier song [...] "Transatlanticism", {{as well as his}} own extensive experience traveling solo, adding that [...] "I’ve always felt that travel is a defining human experience that <b>changes</b> <b>you</b> forever, and hope that this depiction of wanderlust, obsessiveness, repetition, and loneliness conveys some of that.” [...] He also said [...] "The idea is that the band is performing in an incredibly cold environment while this woman is traveling around the world, moving toward progressively warmer climes. [...] The farther she gets from the song's obsessive protagonist, the more her world opens up, and the less reliable his memories of her become." ...|$|E

500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and <b>changes</b> <b>you,</b> or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

[...] To which Jeff's response was [...] "There are two categories for the answer: [...] one is to look at neuroscience, and the other is methods for machine intelligence. In the neuroscience realm there are many predictions that we can make, and those can be tested. If our theories explain a vast array of neuroscience observations then it tells us that we’re on the right track. In the machine learning world they don’t care about that, only how well it works on practical problems. In our case that remains to be seen. To the extent you can solve a problem that no one was able to solve before, people will take notice." ...|$|E
