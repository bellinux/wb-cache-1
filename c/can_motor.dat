40|$|Lecturepg. 65 The {{replacement}} of conventional bearings with magnetic bearings in a <b>canned</b> <b>motor</b> pump is discussed. The primary objective was {{the development of}} a long life bearings for <b>canned</b> <b>motor</b> pumps. The research project was a joint effort between the University of Virginia, Kingsbury, Incorporated, and Goulds Pump Company. The research team designed, constructed and tested the bearings in a 20 hp, 300 gpm, single stage centrifugal <b>canned</b> <b>motor</b> pump running at 3600 rpm. Both magnetic radial and thrust bearings were incorporated in retrofitted bearing housings. Displacement probes sensed the shaft position near the bearings. Control electronics then employed the displacement signal as the feedback signal to control the level of current in the magnets. Proportional-integral-derivative type analog controls were used. The bearings were successfully installed and tested. Performance and vibration tests were conducted on the <b>canned</b> <b>motor</b> pump with the original bearings and with the magnetic bearings. No significant change was found in the pump performance but some small changes were observed in the pump vibration characteristics. It is believed by the authors {{that this is the first}} installation of magnetic bearings in a commercial pump...|$|R

40|$|The {{expectations}} for {{heat transfer fluid}} (HTF) system safety and reliability are continuing to increase. The challenges are many. Leaks produce vapors that ignite readily, fluid viscosity is very low, {{and many of the}} fluids react with oxygen in undesirable ways. Sealless pumps are well suited to HTF applications, eliminating many of the issues which challenge mechanical seals. In addition, one type of sealless pump, the <b>canned</b> <b>motor</b> pump, raises the thermal efficiency of HTF systems. Waste heat from the drive motors of most pumps is dissipated to the air. A shaft driven fan wastes additional energy to accomplish this heat transfer. The waste heat from <b>canned</b> <b>motor</b> pumps <b>can</b> be entirely transferred to the HTF. Methods for analyzing the energy savings and cost implications are provided along with explanations of the other benefits of sealless pumps...|$|R

40|$|AbstractATP synthase {{comprises}} two rotary motors in one. The F 1 <b>motor</b> <b>can</b> {{generate a}} mechanical torque using the hydrolysis energy of ATP. The Fo motor generates a rotary torque {{in the opposite}} direction, but it employs a transmembrane proton motive force. Each <b>motor</b> <b>can</b> be reversed: The Fo <b>motor</b> <b>can</b> drive the F 1 motor in reverse to synthesize ATP, and the F 1 <b>motor</b> <b>can</b> drive the Fo motor in reverse to pump protons. Thus ATP synthase exhibits two of the major energy transduction pathways employed by the cell to convert chemical energy into mechanical force.

40|$|<b>Can</b> <b>motor</b> {{learning}} be {{equivalent in}} {{younger and older}} adults? To address this question, 48 younger (M = 23. 5 years) and 48 older (M = 65. 0 years) participants learned to perform a golf-putting task in two different motor learning situations: one that resulted in infrequent errors or one that resulted in frequent errors. The results demonstrated that infrequent-error learning predominantly relied on nondeclarative, automatic memory processes whereas frequent-error learning predominantly relied on declarative, effortful memory processes: After learning, infrequent-error learners verbalized fewer strategies than frequent-error learners; at transfer, a concurrent, attention-demanding secondary task (tone counting) left motor performance of infrequent-error learners unaffected but impaired that of frequent-error learners. The results showed age-equivalent motor performance in infrequent-error learning but age deficits in frequent-error learning. Motor performance of frequent-error learners required more attention with age, as evidenced by an age deficit on the attention-demanding secondary task. The disappearance of age effects when nondeclarative, automatic memory processes predominated suggests that these processes are preserved with age and are available even early in motor learning. © 2012 Copyright The Experimental Psychology Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Summary of Key Points: Acute experimental pain was clearly shown to exert an inhibitory influence over the motor cortex, which can interfere with motor learning capacities. Current evidence also suggests a relationship between chronic pain and motor cortex reorganization, but it is still unclear whether one causes the other. However, there is growing evidence to the effect that interventions that aim to normalize motor cortex organization can lead to pain relief.
