5|$|Owing to the 1960s {{setting of}} The Secret Service, Derek Meddings and the {{technicians}} {{of the special}} effects department received few commissions for scale models of vehicles that appeared futuristic. This left Unwin's vintage Ford Model T, Gabriel, as their main project, in addition to rendering vehicles and settings common to the decade in miniature and producing the optical enlargement and miniaturisation effects for the character of Harding. Wag Evans manufactured a full-size and two miniature versions (the last of differing scales) of Gabriel, fitting the larger car with belt-driven electric motors, a folding roof, upholstered interior, and a remote <b>control</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 1955 the {{original}} sound negatives began to deteriorate, though a four-track copy had survived in good condition. Using the remaining Fantasound {{system at the}} studio, a three-track stereo copy was transferred across telephone wires onto magnetic film at an RCA facility in Hollywood. This copy was used when Fantasia was reissued in stereo by Buena Vista Distribution in SuperScope, a derivative of the anamorphic widescreen CinemaScope format, on February 7, 1956. The projector featured an automatic <b>control</b> <b>mechanism</b> designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable anamorphic lens, which allowed the picture to switch between its Academy standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to the wide ratio of 2.35:1 in twenty seconds without {{a break in the}} film. This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels. Only selected parts of the animation were stretched, while all live action scenes remained unchanged. This reissue garnered some criticism from viewers, as the widescreen format led to the cropping and reframing of the images.|$|E

The error control classified into two categories: Error correction coding and Error detection coding.

25|$|Broadly, {{negative}} priming is {{also known}} as the mechanism by which inhibitory control is applied to cognition. This refers only to the inhibition stimuli that can interfere with the current short-term goal of creating a response. The effectiveness of inhibiting the interferences depends on the cognitive <b>control</b> <b>mechanism</b> as a higher number of distractors yields higher load on working memory. Increased load on working memory can in turn result in slower perceptual processing leading to delayed reaction. Therefore, negative priming effect depends on the amount of distractors, effectiveness of the cognitive <b>control</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the availability of the cognitive control resources.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} interplay of <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in project based {{industrial}} organizations {{in order to understand}} what is their impact on knowledge creation processes at teams’ level. Extant literature has shown that organizations may avail themselves of a variety of different coordination and <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to be deployed simultaneously (Okhuysen and Bechky, 2009; Whyte and Levitt, 2011, van Donk and Molloy, 2009). Building on previous studies internal to the traditional dichotomy formal/bureaucratic vs. informal control modes (Kirsch, 1997; Nieminen and Lehtonen, 2008) we identify a portfolio of outcome-based, behaviour-based, clan-based and self-based <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in project based organizations. Our analysis aims at showing to what extent the choice among <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can influence knowledge creation processes taking place at teams level and what is the outcome of {{the interplay of}} selected <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in a given organizational context. <b>Control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in project based organizations, in our view, encompasses all devices and tools that management deploys to ensure that acts, behaviours, outcomes and decisions of individuals and the project team as a whole are consistent with organizational goals and strategy (Tuuli, Rowlinson and Koh, 2010). We believe that the relationship between organizational design choices in terms of <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and the projects ability to deliver effective knowledge creation can be fruitfully investigated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how different <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> relate {{to one another}} in the Spanish corporate governance system. We propose a new empirical approach that consists of analysing <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> according to the non-linearity of the value-ownership relation, and emphasising entrenchment and expropriation phenomena. Our evidence contributes to understanding the role played by several <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the Spanish corporate governance system, which largely differs from the US one. Our results show that <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (especially insider ownership, debt and dividends) are used in a complementary way by Spanish firms. Additionally, this complementarity is only observed when the interests of managers and owners converge, but not when there are controlling owners whose interests need not coincide with those of minority shareholders. Therefore, entrenchment and expropriation effects do influence the relationship among <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005. ...|$|R

30|$|Strategic {{alliance}} can aid {{firms to}} build and sustain their competitive advantages. Firms set up strategic alliance mainly for two purposes: resource acquisition and capability learning. Formal control and social control are two widely adopted <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to secure the effectiveness of strategic alliance. In this study, we construct a model to analyze the choice of <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> based on alliance motivations {{and the influence of}} <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on alliance performance. Based on a survey of 607 Chinese firms, we find that when resource acquisition is the key motivation behind alliance, formal control should be enhanced. Whereas when capability learning is the main purpose of alliance, social control becomes a better choice. Furthermore, this research also finds that the impact of both formal control and social control on alliance performance are nonlinear. Suggestions are provided on how to effectively use <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to attain the purposes of strategic alliance and on how to use <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to enhance alliance performance.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{explosion}} in the diversity of partner <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> hypothesised to stabilise cooperative behaviour among unrelated individuals. Game theory suggests numerous strategies, each with specific decision rules that allow cooperators to control a non-contributing partner. This diversity of hypothetical strategies seems likely to reflect diversity in the types of intraspecific cooperation and interspecific mutualism that exist in nature. It is therefore important to provide a framework that explains similarities and differences between the various hypothetical strategies and that predicts how key parameters that describe the natural history of natural systems favour different <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> We develop a novel unifying framework for pairwise interactions between unrelated individuals, in which we link specific <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to specific game structures. The latter are defined by unique combinations of the states of five parameters that describe investment, aspects of the payoff matrix, the number of interactions and partner choice. We find that specific <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> potentially have utility in a limited number of game structures; conversely, each game structure may typically offer a few competing <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Our framework offers theoreticians specific problems that await mathematical exploration, {{while at the same time}} offering empiricists guidelines for evaluating the game structure and corresponding <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in their systems...|$|R

25|$|TRNA export is also {{dependent}} on the various modifications it undergoes, thus preventing export of improperly functioning tRNA. This quality <b>control</b> <b>mechanism</b> is important due to tRNA's central role in translation, where it is involved in adding amino acids to a growing peptide chain. The tRNA exporter in vertebrates is called exportin-t. Exportin-t binds directly to its tRNA cargo in the nucleus, a process promoted {{by the presence of}} RanGTP. Mutations that affect tRNA's structure inhibit its ability to bind to exportin-t, and consequentially, to be exported, providing the cell with another quality control step. As described above, once the complex has crossed the envelope it dissociates and releases the tRNA cargo into the cytosol.|$|E
