We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E

2500|$|Super Mario Bros., the {{successor}} to the 1983 arcade title Mario Bros., was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka, both of whom belonged to Nintendo's former Entertainment Analysis and Development division at the time. Though not originally using any particular character, the very deliberate creative process of what would become their next game was motivated by their technical knowledge from previous games like Excitebike and Kung Fu, {{by a desire to}} give the ROM cartridge format [...] "a final exclamation point" [...] in light of the forthcoming Famicom Disk System which was expected to become the dominant new game delivery medium, and by continuing their legacy of [...] "athletic games" [...] with a character running and jumping with many obstacles. Miyamoto explained, [...] "We felt strongly about how we were the first to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> genre, and it was a goal of ours to keep pushing it." [...] Development was aimed at simplicity, {{in order to have a}} new game available for the end-of-year shopping season.|$|E

According to Derksen Vlaardingen player and chief witness of the case Herman den Haag had {{received}} a few banknotes for the trouble {{out of the hands}} of a Cambuur official whilst on the toilet. De Volkskrant wanted to get to the bottom of it and called KNVB official Van Zon, who stated he had laughed very hard when he heard the claims. [...] "Money handed out on the toilet? How did he <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that?</b> I have seen it with my own eyes: the Cambuur representative gave the cash to the witnesses. No, not on the toilet but in public in the bar of our restaurant. It wasn't much money either, If I recall correctly it was fl. 50. Those few ten-guilder notes aren't even enough to cover the witnesses' expenses, since all the witnesses had to travel from Rotterdam to here. The KNVB pays fl. 0.35 per kilometre." [...] "Quite a crappy story indeed, Derksen wrote, but then again, that's what we're accustomed to. You wanna know who were present in court at the time? Me, another journalist and a man with a tape recorder. Derksen wasn't there. Probably on the toilet." ...|$|E

As the show began taping, a visibly belligerent Mailer, who admitted {{he had been}} drinking, goaded Vidal and Cavett into trading insults with him on air and continually referred to his [...] "greater intellect". He openly taunted and mocked Vidal (who responded in kind), finally earning the ire of Flanner, who announced during the discussion that she was [...] "becoming very, very bored", telling Mailer [...] "You act as if you're the only people here." [...] As Cavett made jokes comparing Mailer's intellect to his ego, Mailer stated [...] "Why don't {{you look at your}} question sheet and ask your question?", to which Cavett responded [...] "Why don't you fold it five ways and put it where the moon don't shine?" [...] A long laugh ensued, after which Mailer asked Cavett if he had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> line and Cavett replied [...] "I have to tell you a quote from Tolstoy?". The headbutting and later on-air altercation was described by Mailer himself in his essay [...] "Of a Small and Modest Malignancy, Wicked and Bristling with Dots".|$|E

[...] It was also considered a notable contrast from the [...] "sweet and lovable Janet" [...] of singles such as [...] "Miss You Much," [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)," [...] and [...] "Escapade," [...] transitioning to an [...] "edgier front." [...] Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "Most hair metal bands would have paid a lifetime in spandex to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> guitar line, and then Janet goes and melds it with her funky-fresh backup singers and suddenly you can dance to it — and believe you me, {{it is not easy to}} make You're gonna die into a danceable lyric." [...] Elysa Gardner of Vibe said it [...] "rocks with a frisky muscularity," [...] while author W.K. Stratton praised its [...] "thundering bass." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commended its [...] "grimy" [...] and [...] "guitar-driven" [...] approach, which [...] "unleashes a guitar riff somewhere between the Robert Palmer hit 'Simply Irresistible' and Deep Purple's 'Smoke on the Water'." [...] Daniel Durchholz of Amazon stated it [...] "burns the place down with a fierce burst of hard rock," [...] while The Sentinel called it a [...] "dance/rock winner." [...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic considered it a [...] "headbanger" [...] with a [...] "hot, distorted lead guitar break, while Alex Henderson applauded Jackson's vocals as used to their [...] "maximum advantage," [...] declaring it a [...] "pop/rock smoker." [...] Similarly, Logo commended her delivery as it became [...] "less breathy and gets more visceral," [...] displaying aggression. MTV News added Jackson [...] "wailed like a total tigress" [...] throughout the song.|$|E
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it for a long moment -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on her face as she recalled that night.
