40|$|A {{discovery}} Unreviewed Safety Question (USQ) {{was declared}} on the underground waste storage tanks at the Hanford Site in May 1996. The USQ was for condensed-phase organic-nitrate reactions (sometimes called organic <b>complexant</b> reactions) in the tanks. This paper outlines the steps taken {{to close the}} USQ, and resolve the related safety issue. Several processes were used at the Hanford Site to extract and/or process plutonium. These processes resulted in organic complexants (for chelating multivalent cations) and organic extraction solvents {{being sent to the}} underground waste storage tanks. This paper addresses the organic <b>complexant</b> hazard. The organic complexants are in waste matrices that include inert material, diluents, and potential oxidizers. In the presence of oxidizing material, the <b>complexant</b> salts can be made to react exothermically by heating to high temperatures or by applying an external ignition source of sufficient energy. The first organic <b>complexant</b> hazard assessments focused on determining whether a hulk runaway reaction could occur, similar to the 1957 accident at Kyshtm (a reprocessing plant in the former U. S. S. R.). Early analyses (1977 through 1994) examined organic-nitrate reaction onset temperatures and concluded that a bulk runaway reaction could not occur at the Hanford Site because tank temperatures were well below that necessary for bulk runaway. Therefore, it was believed that organic-nitrate reactions were adequately described in the then current Authorization Basis (AB). Subsequent studies examined a different accident scenario, propagation resulting from an external ignition source (e. g., lightning or welding slag) that initiates a combustion front that propagates through the organic waste. A USQ evaluation determined that localized high energy ignition sources were credible, and that point source ignition of organic <b>complexant</b> waste was not adequately addressed i n the then existing AB. Consequently, the USQ was declared on the underground storage tanks in May 1996 for condensed-phase organic-nitrate reactions.

40|$|This is {{a three-year}} project which started on October 1, 1997. This report {{summarizes}} the progress achieved {{for the first}} eight months of the study (through May, 1998). Thermospray positive ion mass spectra of seven different organic <b>complexants</b> have been defined in a water:methanol (1 : 1 by volume) solvent system that was buffered with 0. 1 M ammonium acetate (pH = 6. 7). These <b>complexants</b> were imidodiacetic acid (IDA), ethylenediamine-N,N{prime}-diacetic acid (EDDA), N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) iminodiacetic acid (HEIDA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). Mass spectra of all these <b>complexants</b> showed a peak at mass [M+ 1] + when vaporized from this solvent medium. Only NTA showed a significant peak at mass [M+ 18] + which was interpreted as the formation of an adduct with an ammonium ion from the buffered solvent medium. This observation for the vaporized NTA is consistent with the measured acidity in aqueous solution where the first acid dissociation for NTA has a lower pK value than those reported for EDTA, HEDTA, and IDA (1). This tendency to form an ammonium adduct in the gas phase would indicate that NTA has a lower proton affinity than the other <b>complexants</b> in the vaporized phase. This lower proton affinity in the vapor phase would be consistent with the greater observed acidity in the solution phase. Accordingly, this observation provides an indication that characteristics observed after thermospray vaporization may aid in defining behavior in solution. Such interpretations of thermospray mass spectra should be useful in the characterization of DOE mixed waste solutions. Progress has also been made in developing thermospray mass spectra at source temperatures of less than 170 C. Such lower source temperatures should reduce the amount to thermal degradation for labile species. Pressures in the analyzer chamber of the mass spectrometer tend to elevate as the thermospray source temperature is reduced; however, the instrument has been operated for up to 8 hours at a source temperature of 175 C and a solvent flow of 1 ml/min.
