In addition, there was one treatment with spring ploughing and <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrowing (two runs) and one treatment with rotary cultivation (one run). The experiments were carried out on light soils, rich in fine sand and silt. In one of the experiments, however, the soil had a clay content as high as 23 per cent. Among the harrows, the disc harrow gave the best mean yield result. Four runs gave the highest yield. The differenees were, however small. Ploughing in the spring did not increase the crop yield.

Yield levels on the Saïs Plateau between Meknès and Fez in the semi-arid zone, however, remain low possibly because of sub-optimum water use due to inefficient tillage systems. A study was carried out to investigate the effect of soil tillage operations on water infiltration. Two systems of seedbed preparation on a silty clay soil were compared: traditional disc harrow (‘cover crop’) versus reduced tillage using a <b>spring</b> <b>tined</b> cultivator (‘vibrocultor’). Infiltration processes were studied using a rainfall simulator applying rainfall typical for aggressive events in the region. The effect of tillage and rainfall on the structure of the soil was assessed by both quantitative and descriptive methods. It was found that the disc harrow caused excessive pulverisation and seal formation under rainfall. Water infiltration, on the other hand, was not hindered by plough sole formation or subsoil compaction.

40|$|Within organic farming, {{chemical}} {{weed control}} is prohibited and is generally being replaced by different tillage practices. At {{the same time the}} supply of sufficient amounts of nitrogen is often a problem within organic fanning. In cereal crops, harrowing is considered {{to be one of the}} most important mechanical weeding techniques. The loosening and aerating of the soil produced by harrowing should potentially enhance nitrogen mineralization. Furthermore, harrowing could enhance the soil structure and water content, since tillage is generally known to positively affect these soil factors through mechanisms such as crust breaking and enhanced tillering in cereals. This study investigated the effects of mechanical weed control in the spring on weeds, nitrogen mineralization and yield of winter wheat. Weed control was carried out when the crop had 2 - 3 leaves. Three different implements were tested on two soils differing in clay content for three consecutive years: A Väderstad Crosskill roller, an s-tine harrow and a <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow, and compared with untreated controls. Soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm layers and total nitrogen content of the crop were determined on several occasions for calculations of net nitrogen mineralization in the soi 1. The numbers and weight of weeds were recorded one month after harrowing and at the time of harvesting. Grain yield was measured at harvest. The amount of dicotyledonous weeds was reduced by harrowing. On the soils with the lower clay content, weed numbers were reduced to between 50 and 82 % of those in the control, while on the soil with the higher clay content they were reduced to between 42 and 82 % of those in the control. On average, the best effect on the lighter clay soils was achieved by use of the s-tine harrow, while on the heavier clay soils the Väderstad Crosskill roller and the spring-tine harrow had the best weed control effect. In the harrowed treatments, the average mineral N content in the 0 - 30 cm layer was enhanced by only 0. 4 kg ha⁻¹. At the same time the N uptake in the crop was reduced by approximately the same amount due to the crop suffering mechanical damage, and calculations of net nitrogen mineralization showed no increase in N mineralization after harrowing. Despite annual variations, harrowing in general had a positive effect on grain yield. Comparing the different implements, the best yields on the lighter clay soil were achieved by use of the <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow, which increased the yield compared with the control by an average of 5 % in two years out of three (2002 - 2005). The best results on the heavier clay soils were achieved by use of Väderstad Crosskill roller, which gave a 5 % yield increase compared with the control, while the use of <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow and s-tine harrow caused a yield reduction of about the same magnitude. On both soil types, the use of an s-tine harrow had a negative effect on wheat yield, probably due to a high degree of mechanical damage to the crop...|$|R

Chicory is the second most important vegetable crop of the area after carrot. The physical weed control strategy included the stale seed-bed technique before crop transplanting and one or more mechanical and manual interventions after transplanting. Three different operative machines two meters wide were adopted for false seed-bed technique: a rolling harrow, a flame weeder and a <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow. A conventional hoe or a specific innovative precision hoe with six units (45 cm of inter-row) were used to perform both inter-row and intra-row (by means of torsion weeders) weed control.

The results were quite interesting and stressed the chicory high quality yield, under the different physical weed control strategies. ...|$|R

Effects of three different tillage systems: conventional tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage on penetration resistance, emergence time, shooting degree and yield were investigated. Conventional tillage used a moldboard plough for primary tilling and a combined <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> cultivator-spike tooth harrow for consecutive secondary tilling. Reduced tillage included only a cultivator-tooth harrow combination. No-tillage was accomplished by a direct (stubble) drill. Although the earliest emergence time (17 day) and the highest emergence degree (66. 5 %) were obtained, yield was the lowest in no-tillage system. The highest penetration resistance (53. 71 kg cm - 2) was measured in no-tillage system. Reduced and no tillage systems could be proposed for Gökhöyük region if alternative solutions is found to prevent soil compaction and reduce mechanical impedance in root growth zone.

40|$|Tillage {{practices}} influence physical, chemical, {{and biological}} soil properties, which also affect soil quality and consequently plant growth. In this study, the main {{objective was to}} evaluate the effect of different tillage systems on soil physical properties by using geophysical methods, namely, ground-penetrating radar (far-field and near-field GPR), capacitance probes (ThetaProbe and 5 TE), electromagnetic induction (EMI) (Profiler and EM 38), soil sampling, and by soil penetrometer. Since 2005, three contrasting tillage systems were applied on different plots of an agricultural field: i) conventional tillage (CT) with mouldboard ploughing to 27 cm depth, ii) deep loosening tillage (DL) with a heavy tine cultivator to 30 cm depth, and iii) reduced tillage (RT) with a <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> cultivator to 10 cm depth. The geophysical and soil strength measurements were performed in April 2010. We observed that tillage influences the soil resistance (deeper tillage decreases soil resistance), which could be partly seen in the radar data. Soil water content reference measurements (capacitance probes and soil sampling) were in a relatively good agreement with the water content estimates from far-field GPR. We also observed that the tillage influences surface water content. Mean surface water content was significantly lower for CT than for DL and RT, which was partly explained by lower macropore connectivity between the topsoil and the deeper layers after conventional tillage. This study confirms the potential of GPR and EMI sensors for soil physical properties determination at the field scale and for the characterization of agricultural management practices...|$|R

Firstly, the strategy of physical weed control of carrot in the Fucino Valley was defined and included the realization of the false seed-bed technique, a flame treatment before crop emergence and one or more mechanical (precision hoeing) and manual interventions in post-emergence. False seed-bed technique was performed by means of a specific <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow two meters wide, while flaming was performed by means of an operative machine equipped with four “open flame” rod burners 50 cm wide. A specific precision hoe with eleven units (inter-row of about 18 cm) was built, tested, improved and set up to perform weed control both between (by means of a rigid tine supporting a 9 cm wide horizontal blade) and in rows (by means of vibrating teeth or torsion weeder). During the testing period the evolution of weed flora (both presence and biomass) was monitored and carrot root yield was recorded.

40|$|Controlling weeds {{in spring}} cereals grown under organic {{conditions}} is mostly done by post emergence weed harrowing, where <b>spring</b> <b>tines</b> of the weed harrow control weeds by uprooting and/or covering small weeds plants with soil. In situations with relatively large weed plants and relatively small crop plants, there are increased risks for crop damages by soil coverage or other mechanical damages {{of the crop}} leaves. These damages are increasing with increasing weed control intensity, and are resulting in reduced crop growth immediately after weed harrowing. There are risks that the reduced growth reduces final crop yield too. However, {{there is some evidence}} that there are varietal differences in the tolerance to weed harrowing. The aim of this study was to estimate the damages by weed harrowing in four pure genotypes and three two- or one three-component mixtures of spring barley, and to analyze if there were differences in tolerance to weed harrowing between the genotypes and mixtures. Results from a two-year field study showed that there were varietal differences in the tolerance to mechanical weed control in the immediate effect as well as the short term effect, however there were marked differences in the immediate and short term effect between the two years. Regarding the long term effect of weed harrowing on yield, there were no significant differences in 2003 but in 2004, Brazil and the three component mixture suffered significantly from weed harrowing while Modena, Otira and Modena+Orthega mixture, seems to benefit from weed harrowing. The reason for these differences is probably due to differences in growth habit at the time for weed harrowing. ...|$|R
