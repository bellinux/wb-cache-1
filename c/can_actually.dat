5|$|Strangelets {{are small}} {{fragments}} of strange matter—a hypothetical form of quark matter—that contain roughly {{equal numbers of}} up, down, and strange quarks and that are more stable than ordinary nuclei (strangelets would {{range in size from}} a few femtometers to a few meters across). If strangelets <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> exist, and if they were produced at the LHC, they could conceivably initiate a runaway fusion process in which all the nuclei in the planet would be converted to strange matter, similar to a strange star.|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same time it takes to orbit Earth. This results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards Earth. However, due to the effect of libration, about 59% of the Moon's surface <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> be seen from Earth.|$|E

The writers noted in the audio commentary that Jackson <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> play the piano, and that when he receives musical scenes, he learns the piece(s) beforehand to be able to play it for the scene.|$|E
5|$|Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating optics such as {{binoculars}} {{may result}} in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight. When using an attenuating filter to view the Sun, the viewer is cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use. Some improvised filters that pass UV or IR rays, <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> harm the eye at high brightness levels.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} few {{antidepressants}} {{that does}} not cause sexual dysfunction. A range of studies demonstrate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants, but <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> help to alleviate sexual dysfunction. According to a survey of psychiatrists, it is the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, although this is not an indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. There have also been a few studies suggesting that bupropion can improve sexual function in women who are not depressed, if they have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).|$|E

5|$|Denver {{lies within}} the semi-arid, {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification BSk). It has four distinct seasons and receives a modest {{amount of precipitation}} spread throughout the year. Due to its inland location on the High Plains, {{at the foot of}} the Rocky Mountains, Denver, like all cities along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains, is subject to sudden changes in weather. Contrary to the popular belief that Denver receives 300 days of sunshine a year, the city <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> expect to receive an average of 115 clear days, 130 partly cloudy days, and 120 cloudy days each year.|$|E
5|$|If a star {{displays}} magnetic {{surface activity}} such as starspots, then these features can be tracked {{to estimate the}} rotation rate. However, such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes {{over the course of}} their life span, so differential rotation of a star can produce varying measurements. Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid rotation, so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars. Observation of starspots has shown that these features <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> vary the rotation rate of a star, as the magnetic fields modify the flow of gases in the star.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> be a good thing. For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of power, but rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E

5|$|The player's primary mode of {{transportation}} is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, buy new equipment, and travel to numerous planetary systems. Although the game features {{a large number of}} planets for the player to examine, only a few of them <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> be landed on and explored. Some of them can also be surveyed to search for valuable resources and quest-relevant items. Upon landing on a planet, the player can traverse on-foot or by using an all-terrain infantry fighting vehicle called the M35 Mako. Most of the game's main quests are geared toward on-foot combat, but some segments may feature combat requiring the use of the M35 Mako. In contrast, secondary quests usually require the player to explore free-roam uncharted worlds with the vehicle. Equipment items, which include armor, weapon, and ammunition upgrades, can be found around the environment or purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E
5|$|The Kirtlandian faunal age {{was named}} by Lucas and Sullivan in 2003, and found by their {{original}} study to date from 74.9 to 72million years ago. In 2006, Sullivan and Lucas refined their estimate, {{stating that the}} Kirtlandian ranged from 75 to 72.8million years ago. Later that year, Sullivan changed the time range again, finding that the faunal age lasted only 2 million years, from 74.8 to 72.8million years ago. He said that the later part of the Kirtlandian, from the De-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation, dated to 73 million years ago, {{on the basis of}} ash layers dating to 73.04 and 73.37million years ago. This observation was based on findings by Sullivan and Lucas, who dated the two ash layers from 73.04 ± 0.25 and 73.37 ± 0.28million years ago. They also dated the earlier ashes from the Fruitland Formation, which dated to 75.56 ± 0.41, 74.55 ± 0.29, and 74.11 ± 0.62 million years ago. The first ash, called by them the Dog Eye Pond, was found slightly higher than the start of the Fruitland Formation, which meant that the start of the Fruitland Formation was older than 75.5 million years ago. More precise dating in 2010 by Longrich found that the second youngest ash <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> be dated more precisely than thought by Sullivan (2006), only having an error range of 0.18million years. Longrich also dated the two older ashes, finding a date {{the same as that of}} Sullivan in 2006. These ash datings are what Sullivan used to find the precise age of the Kirtlandian age.|$|E

5000|$|Gas duster, {{also known}} as canned air or {{compressed}} air, is a product used for cleaning or dusting electronic equipment and other sensitive devices that cannot be cleaned using water. The products are most often a can that, when a trigger is pressed, blasts a stream of compressed gas through a nozzle. Despite the name [...] "canned air", the <b>cans</b> <b>actually</b> contain gases that are compressable into liquids. Air on the contrary, cannot be compressed into liquid at any reasonable pressure since the critical temperatures of air components (-146.9 C for nitrogen; -118.6 C for oxygen) are much beyond normal handling temperatures. Common duster gases are 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, or 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. Hydrocarbons, like butane, were often used in the past, but their flammable nature forced manufacturers to use fluorocarbons. When inhaled, gas duster fumes may produce psychoactive effects and may be harmful to health.|$|R
