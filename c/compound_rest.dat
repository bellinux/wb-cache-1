Studies were performed during (1) normoxic conditions, (2) glycolytic inhibition, or (3) chemical anoxia at 37 ∘C, in order to characterize ions and channels promoting membrane depolarization. Ouabain, an antagonist of Na+,K+-ATPase, caused strong depolarization, showing that {{membrane potential}} is critically dependent on Na+,K+-ATPase. In addition, inhibiting energy metabolism during ouabain exposure produced further depolarization, suggesting additional ATP-dependent, ouabain-insensitive ion transport systems. Glycolysis was blocked with iodoacetate or deoxyglucose, evoking a response consisting of four distinct phases. An initial transient hyperpolarization (phase 1) preceded a rapid depolarizing response (phase 2). Phase 2 {{was interrupted by a}} second brief hyperpolarization (phase 3) which was followed by a gradual depolarization (phase 3). Chemical anoxia (cyanide) immediately depolarized the nerve, with only a small inflection introducing a final slow depolarizing response. Addition of ouabain to cyanide-treated nerves caused an additional depolarization indicating a minor glycolytic contribution to Na+,K+-ATPase, which seems preferentially fueled by mitochondrial ATP in optic nerve. Hyperpolarizing phases 1 and 3 induced by iodoacetate exposure and the inflection during cyanide treatment were abolished by zero-Ca 2 +/EGTA treatment. Block of Na+ channels with tetrodotoxin, the local anesthetics, procaine or QX- 314, or replacement of Na+ with the impermeant cation choline significantly reduced depolarization during iodoacetate or cyanide application, indicating that axonal membrane depolarization requires Na+ influx which secondarily allows electroneutral K+ efflux and depolarization.

METHODS: Subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for SAD underwent regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) SPECT using Tc-HMPAO at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment with either citalopram or moclobemide. Using statistical parametric mapping brain SPECT studies were analysed {{to determine the effects of}} treatment on rCBF, to compare the effects of citalopram and moclobemide, and to detect correlations between changes in rCBF and clinical response. RESULTS: Subjects received citalopram (n= 17) or moclobemide (n= 14) as therapy. Subjects in both treatment groups demonstrated a significant improvement of SAD symptoms as measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale total score. All subjects demonstrated a decrease in rCBF in the insulae post therapy. Subjects receiving citalopram had decreased superior cingulate rCBF after therapy compared to those receiving moclobemide. CONCLUSION: Both SSRI's and RIMA's decreased rCBF in the insulae during treatment of SAD; an effect that may be consistent with the role of these regions in processing internal somatic cues evoked by emotional stimuli. Citalopram had a greater effect on superior cingulate perfusion, an effect that is consistent with evidence of high levels of 5 -HT transporters in this region. Articl...|$|R

Indeed, quite similar EEG experiments and the same kind of spectral data analysis can be performed in animal models of AD and in elderly individuals with prodromal or manifest AD. Several studies have shown that AChEIs affect both resting state EEG rhythms and cognitive functions in AD patients. After few weeks of successful treatment, delta (0 - 3. Hz) or theta (4 - 7.

A proton motive force was generated by electrogenic exchange of citrate and lactate catalyzed by the citrate transporter CitP and proton consumption in decarboxylation reactions in the pathway. In the absence of glucose or L-lactate, citrate consumption was biphasic. During the first phase, hardly any citrate was consumed. In the second phase, citrate was converted rapidly, but without the formation of acetoin. Instead, significant amounts of the intermediates pyruvate and alpha-acetolactate, and the end product acetate, were excreted from the cells. It is shown that the intermediates and acetate are excreted in exchange with the uptake of citrate catalyzed by CitP. The availability of exchangeable substrates in the cytoplasm determines both the rate of citrate consumption and the end product profile. It follows that citrate metabolism in L. lactis IL 1403 (pFL 3) splits up in two routes after the formation of pyruvate, one the well-characterized route yielding acetoin and the other a new route yielding acetate. The flux distribution between the two branches changes from 85 : 15 in the presence of L-lactate to 30 : 70 in the presence of pyruvate. The proton motive force generated was greatest in the presence of L-lactate and zero in the presence of pyruvate, suggesting that the pathway to acetate does not generate proton motive force...|$|R

I have taken every care to cite the work that has been included in this report. If I have inadvertently missed, I apologize. Furthermore, this report is by no means an exhaustive review of the literature. Before we go any further, I think it is good to point out the expected radiation dosage in various proposed machines – ITER design specification is equivalent to neutron fluence levels of 1 x 1018 n/cm 2 (E> 0. 1 MeV) and a dose of 47 MGy [1]. For LHC IR quadrupole coils, it is 1016 n/cm 2 (E> 0. 1 MeV) and 22. 5 MGy over first 10 years with luminosity profile defined in [2]. For 2 nd generation LHC IR quads or LARP IR quads it is 2. 08 x 1016 n/cm 2 (E> 0. 1 MeV) and 45 MGy integrated the same way [2 - 3]. Note that LHC IR quadrupoles have less neutron fluence levels, but have similar 10 -yr dose levels as ITER. The materials that make up the coil are most susceptible to the radiation damage. They include, the superconductor, cable insulation, coil end-parts and depending on the magnet technology the potting <b>compound.</b> The <b>rest</b> of the magnet structure is made up of mostly metals that have much higher radiation resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{numbers of}} natural {{chemical}} elements, minerals, inorganic and organic chemical compounds {{are determined by}} 1, 2, 3 and 4 -combinations of a set 95 and are respectively equal to 95, 4, 465, 138, 415 and 3, 183, 545. To explain these relations it is suggested the concept of information coefficient of proportionality as mathematical generalization of the proportionality coefficient for any set of positive numbers. It is suggested a hypothesis that the unimodal distributions of the sets of information coefficients of proportionality for atomic weights of chemical elements of minerals and chemical compounds correspond to unimodal distributions of the above sets for combination of 2, 3 and 4 atomic weights of 95 natural chemical elements. The expected values of symmetrized distributions of information coefficients of proportionality sets for atomic weights of minerals and chemical compounds are proposed {{to be used to}} define chemical compounds, like atomic weights define chemical elements. Variational series of the expected values can be represented as a sequence of packets of 95 values. The Periodic Table should be extended to the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements and Chemical Compounds consisting of a short period with 95 chemical elements and 4, 465 minerals, and 24 periods with 138, 415 compounds each. All naturally occurred chemical elements, minerals and chemical compounds should be packed in 95 to compose the suggested Table. The first long period comprises the packets of inorganic <b>compounds,</b> the <b>rest</b> of the periods include the packets of organic compounds. Comment: 18 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
50|$|In Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty, Bruce Wayne's distant {{ancestor}} Joshua of Wainwright initially acts as {{a member}} of the Knights Templar, but when faced with a raid on Vandal Savage's <b>compound</b> after the <b>rest</b> of his group have been slain by Savage's minions, he dons his old family armour, which includes a bat-like crest and a helmet in the style of the usual Bat-cowl, including small points and a visor that shields his eyes, although his equipment consists only of a sword and a short iron knife. In the present day, after Savage kills his parents on his wedding night, Bruce adopts the familiar Batman costume to hunt their killer, later adapting it into a spacesuit with its own air supply and the cowl now an actual helmet when he confronts Vandal on a space shuttle. In the twenty-fifth Century, Brenna Wayne devises three bat-themed costumes to track the source of the conspiracy against her family, with two being high-tech black-and-orange suits with such advanced weaponry as flamethrowers in the cape/wings, and the third a simpler black suit with gold trim.|$|R
40|$|When {{the rare}} earth mononitrides (RENs) first {{burst onto the}} {{scientific}} scene {{in the middle of}} last century, there were feverish dreams that their strong magnetic moment would afford a wide range of applications. For decades research was frustrated by poor stoichiometry and the ready reaction of the materials in ambient conditions, and only recently have these impediments finally been overcome by advances in thin film fabrication with ultra-high vacuum based growth technology. Currently, the field of research into the RENs is growing rapidly, motivated by the materials demands of proposed electronic and spintronic devices. Both semiconducting and ferromagnetic properties have been established in some of the RENs which thus attract interest for the potential to exploit the spin of charge carriers in semiconductor technologies for both fundamental and applied science. In this review, we take stock of where progress has occurred within the last decade in both theoretical and experimental fields, and which has led to the point where a proof-of-concept spintronic device based on RENs has already been demonstrated. The article is organized into three major parts. First, we describe the epitaxial growth of REN thin films and their structural properties, with an emphasis on their prospective spintronic applications. Then, we conduct a critical review of the different advanced theoretical calculations utilised to determine both the electronic structure and the origins of the magnetism in these <b>compounds.</b> The <b>rest</b> of the review is devoted to the recent experimental results on optical, electrical and magnetic properties and their relation to current theoretical descriptions. These results are discussed particularly with regard to the controversy about the exact nature of the magnetic state and conduction processes in the RENs. Comment: 34 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
40|$|In Lambert–Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS), antibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels {{reduce the}} quantal release of acetylcholine, causing muscle weakness and autonomic dysfunction. More {{than half of}} the affected patients have associated small cell lung cancer, and thorough screening for an underlying malignancy is crucial. The mainstay of treatment for LEMS is symptomatic but immunotherapy is needed in more severely affected patients. Symptomatic therapies aim at increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at the muscle endplate. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were the first drugs to be used for the amelioration of symptoms, 3, 4 -diaminopyridine (3, 4 -DAP, amifampridine) {{has been shown to be}} more effective. 3, 4 -DAP blocks presynaptic potassium channels, thereby prolonging the action potential and increasing presynaptic calcium concentrations. This then results in increased quantal release of acetylcholine. The efficacy of 3, 4 -DAP for increasing muscle strength and <b>resting</b> <b>compound</b> muscle action potentials has been demonstrated by four placebo-controlled trials. Side effects are usually mild, and the most frequently reported are paresthesias. The most common serious adverse events are epileptic seizures. 3, 4 -DAP is currently the treatment of choice in patients with Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome...|$|R
