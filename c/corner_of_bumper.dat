25|$|The 997 Turbo {{debuted in}} February 2006 at the Geneva Motor Show. It {{featured}} a new front bumper with LED turn signal strips {{in the air}} intakes; the fog lamps were moved to the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bumpers.</b> Large air vents fore and aft of the rear wheels provide other obvious visual cues of the Turbo model. Also featured was a retractable rear wing, as used on the 996 Turbo.|$|R
50|$|Because the United States {{does not}} {{recognise}} the international ECE Regulations on auto safety components and constructions, but rather maintains its own Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, {{the front of}} the B4 had to be specially redesigned for vehicles sold in North America. The front and bumper had to be designed to accommodate impact energy absorbers not required outside North America. Instead of the dual-reflector headlamps, a single-reflector design was used inboard of an amber combination turn signal, parking, and side marker lamp and reflector wrapping around the corner, and fog lamps smaller than the rest-of-world items were placed the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bumper</b> air duct.|$|R
5000|$|Virgil Exner's 1961 styling {{with its}} reverse fins, rear fender {{scalloping}} (the headlights were widely {{referred to as}} [...] "ingrown toenails") and concave grille was highly unpopular with consumers. The low position and small size of the Dart's tail lights just above the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bumper,</b> was also criticized and drivers of following cars complained {{that they could not}} see them. The wraparound taillights projected light sideward, not rearward. By mid-year, Dodge made auxiliary taillights available at extra cost through its dealer network. However, these large round lights were mounted near the inboard side of the reverse fins, and aggravated the already awkward styling.|$|R
50|$|Many other {{turbo-charged}} cars, particularly {{where the}} aesthetics of the car {{are not to be}} compromised by top mount scoops, such as the Toyota Supra (JZA80 only), Nissan 300ZX Twin Turbo, Nissan Silvia (S13/14/14a/15), Nissan 180sx, Mitsubishi 3000gt, Saab 900, Volkswagen, Fiat Turbo diesels, Audi TT, and Turbo Mitsubishi Eclipse use side-mounted air-to-air intercoolers (SMIC), which are mounted in the front <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bumper</b> or {{in front of one of}} the wheels. Side-mounted intercoolers are generally smaller, mainly due to space constraints, and sometimes two are used to gain the performance of a larger, single intercooler. Cars such as the Subaru Impreza WRX, MINI Cooper S, Toyota Celica GT-Four, Nissan Pulsar GTI-R, Acura RDX, Mazdaspeed3, Mazdaspeed6, and the PSA Peugeot Citroën turbo diesels, use air-to-air top mounted intercoolers (TMIC) located on top of the engine. Air is directed through the intercooler through the use of a hood scoop. In the case of the PSA cars, the air flows through the grille above the front bumper, then through under-hood ducting. Top mounted intercoolers sometimes suffer from heat diffusion due to proximity with the engine, warming them and reducing their overall efficiency. Some World Rally Championship cars use a reverse-induction system design whereby air is forced through ducts in the front bumper to a horizontally mounted intercooler.|$|R

40|$|During strong earthquakes, {{structural}} pounding {{may occur}} between {{the equipment and}} the surrounding moat wall because of the limited separation distance and the deformations of the isolator. A potential mitigation measure for this problem is the incorporation <b>of</b> collision <b>bumpers.</b> The aim <b>of</b> the paper is to study the experimental dynamic response and to formulate numerical model of a base-isolated SDOF oscillator excited by a harmonic base acceleration and symmetrically bounded by two unilateral deformable and dissipative constraints. Static tests have been first performed to determine the static characteristics and the support conditions <b>of</b> the <b>bumpers,</b> and successively, shaking table tests {{have been carried out}} to investigate two different configurations: the absence and the presence <b>of</b> <b>bumpers.</b> In both configurations, tests were carried out with the same type of excitation to the base. Different values of the table acceleration peak were applied, different amplitude values of the total gap between mass and bumpers were considered, and also two different types <b>of</b> <b>bumpers</b> were employed. The experimental dynamic responses in the absence and in the presence <b>of</b> <b>bumpers</b> have been compared, and the results obtained in the presence <b>of</b> <b>bumpers</b> have also been used to identify some characteristics of the dynamics with impact (force and time of contact between mass and bumpers, energy dissipated by the bumpers during the impact, and coefficient of restitution). A suitable model has been developed to numerically simulate the behavior of the system by using a general-purpose computer code, achieving a good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
