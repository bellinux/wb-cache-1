5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called <b>conventional</b> <b>current.</b> The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E

40|$|The {{probability}} distributions, {{as well as}} {{the mean}} values of stochastic currents and fluxes, associated with a driven Langevin process, provide a good and topologically protected measure of how far a stochastic system is driven out of equilibrium. By viewing a Langevin process on a compact oriented manifold of arbitrary dimension m as a theory of a random vector field associated with the environment, we are able to consider stochastic motion of higher-dimensional objects, which allow new observables, called higher-dimensional currents, to be introduced. These higher dimensional currents arise by counting intersections of a k-dimensional trajectory, produced by a evolving (k- 1) -dimensional cycle, with a reference cross section, represented by a cycle of complimentary dimension (m - k). We further express the mean fluxes in terms of the solutions of the Supersymmetric Fokker-Planck (SFP), thus generalizing the corresponding well-known expressions for the <b>conventional</b> <b>currents...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{design and}} {{application}} of a fuzzy logic based controller to a leakage current relay was presented in this paper. A novel approach based on fuzzy logic to form the tripping action of leakage current relay was investigated. In addition to the theoretical aspect of fuzzy logic, detection of a leakage current, measurement of the leakage current, determination of its duration, trip opening of faulty cases and detailed system architecture were also introduced. The inspected fuzzy logic technique to control the tripping action of the leakage current relay was intended to improve the performance of <b>conventional</b> leakage <b>current</b> relay control for human safety and system reliability. The relationship between the controlled output of the fuzzy processor and properties of leakage current for the proposed relay was explored by using a graphical output expression.

40|$|Pulsed {{eddy current}} (PEC) {{nondestructive}} testing differs from <b>conventional</b> eddy <b>current</b> techniques {{in that the}} probe coil is excited by a pulse, rather than continuous excitation at a single frequency. Reviews of early work on pulsed eddy currents are given by Waidelich 1 and by Renkin. 2 Pulsed excitation causes the propagation of a highly attenuated traveling wave, which is governed by the diffusion equation. 3 The diffusive propagation of the eddy current pulse results in spatial broadening and a delay, or travel time, proportional to {{the square of the}} distance traveled. It was realized in early work on pulsed eddy current systems that this time dependence offered certain advantages over <b>conventional</b> eddy <b>currents.</b> 4 In the current study we demonstrate the ability of a prototype pulsed eddy current instrument, described elsewhere, 5, 6 {{to take advantage of this}} time dependence to discriminate flaws from such interfering signals as probe liftoff, air gaps, and fasteners...|$|R
