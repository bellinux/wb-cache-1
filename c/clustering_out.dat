We found her in her premises, {{springing}} about with a bird-like action. She has a lofty room, with a skylight window; it was pretty well warmed with a stove, and there was a small orange-tree in a pot, with the oranges growing on it, and two or three flower-shrubs in bloom. She herself looked prettily, with her jaunty little velvet cap on the side of her head, whence came <b>clustering</b> <b>out,</b> her short brown curls; her face full of pleasant life and quick expression; and though somewhat worn with thought and struggle, handsome and spirited. She told us that [...] "her wig was growing as gray as a rat." ...|$|E

He looked pale and absent as he bent himself down to take my hand. It {{was almost as if}} in secret {{collusion}} we had breathed the word Fanny together. Mrs Crimble was supplied with a tea-cup, and her front teeth were soon unusually busy with a slice of thin bread and butter. Eating or drinking, her intense old eyes dwelt distantly but assiduously on my small shape; and she at last entered into a long story of how, as a girl, she had been taken to a circus--a circus: and there had seen.... But what she had seen Mr Crimble refused to let her divulge. He jerked forward so hastily that his fragment of toasted scone rolled off his plate into the wild beast's skin, and while, with some little difficulty, he was retrieving it, he assured us that his mother's memory was little short of miraculous, and particularly in relation to the past.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} current {{clustering}} observations of quasars and luminous AGN {{can be explained}} by a merger model augmented by feedback from outflows. Using numerical simulations large enough to study <b>clustering</b> <b>out</b> to 25 comoving h − 1 Mpc, we calculate correlation functions, biases, and correlation lengths as a function of AGN redshift and optical and X-ray luminosity. At optical wavelengths, our results match a wide range of current observations and generate predictions for future data sets. We reproduce the weak luminosity dependence of clustering over the currently well-measured range, and predict a much stronger dependence at higher luminosities. The increase in the amplitude of binary quasar clustering observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is also reproduced and is predicted to occur at higher redshift, an effect that is due to the one halo term in the correlation function. On the other hand, our results do not match the rapid evolution of the correlation length observed in the SDSS at z ≃ 3, a discrepancy that is at least partially due to differences in the scales probed by our simulation versus this survey. In fact, we show that changing the distances sampled from our simulations can produce changes as large as 40 % in the fitted correlation lengths. Finally, in the X-ray, our simulations produce correlation lengths similar to that observed in the Chandra Deep Field (CDF) North, but not the significantly larger correlation length observed in the CDF South.

40|$|We present {{analyses}} of the two-point correlation properties of the ESP galaxy redshift survey. From the redshift-space correlation function xi(s), we see positive <b>clustering</b> <b>out</b> to separations 50 /h Mpc, with a smooth break on larger scales and zero-crossing between 60 and 80 /h Mpc. xi(s) is reasonably well described by a shallow power law with γ 1. 5 between 3 and 50 /h Mpc, while on smaller scales (0. 2 - 2 /h Mpc) it has a shallower slope (γ 1). We examine the full effect of redshift-space distortions through the two-dimensional correlation function xi(rp,pi), from which we project out the real-space xi(r) below 10 /h Mpc. This function is well described by a power-law model (r/r_o) ^-γ, with r_o= 4. 15 ^+ 0. 20 _- 0. 21 h^- 1 Mpc and consistent picture in which clustering remains positive out to separations of 50 /h Mpc or larger, in substantial agreement with the results obtained from angular surveys like the APM and EDSGC. Also {{the shape of the}} two-point correlation function is remarkably unanimous among these data sets, in all cases requiring more power above 5 /h Mpc (a `shoulder'), than a simple extrapolation of the canonical xi(r) =(r/ 5) ^- 1. 8. xi(s) for volume-limited subsamples shows evidence of luminosity segregation only for the most luminous sample with M_b_J< - 20. 5. When redshift-space distortions are removed through projection of xi(rp,pi), however, a weak dependence on luminosity is seen at small separations also at fainter magnitudes. This effect is masked in redshift space, as the mean pairwise velocity dispersion experiences a parallel increase, basically erasing the effect of the clustering growth on xi(s) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{measure the}} {{evolution}} of galaxy <b>clustering</b> <b>out</b> to a redshift of z~ 1. 5 using data from two MUSYC fields, the Extended Hubble Deep Field South (EHDF-S) and the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDF-S). We use photometric redshift information to calculate the projected-angular correlation function, omega(sigma), from which we infer the projected correlation function Xi(sigma). We demonstrate that this technique delivers accurate measurements of clustering even when large redshift measurement errors affect the data. To this aim we use two mock MUSYC fields extracted from a LambdaCDM simulation populated with GALFORM semi-analytic galaxies which allow us to assess the degree of accuracy of our estimates of Xi(sigma) and to identify and correct for systematic effects in our measurements. We study {{the evolution of}} clustering for volume limited subsamples of galaxies selected using their photometric redshifts and rest-frame r-band absolute magnitudes. We find that the real-space correlation length r_ 0 of bright galaxies, M_r<- 21 (rest-frame) can be accurately recovered out to z~ 1. 5, particularly for ECDF-S given its near-infrared photometric coverage. There is mild evidence for a luminosity dependent clustering in both fields at the low redshift samples (up to = 0. 57), where the correlation length is higher for brighter galaxies by up to 1 Mpc/h between median rest-frame r-band absolute magnitudes of - 18 to - 21. 5. As {{a result of the}} photometric redshift measurement, each galaxy is assigned a best-fit template; we restrict to E and E+ 20 %Sbc types to construct subsamples of early type galaxies (ETGs). Our ETG samples show a strong increase in r_ 0 as the redshift increases, making it unlikely (95 % level) that ETGs at median redshift z_med= 1. 15 are the direct progenitors of ETGs at z_med= 0. 37 with equivalent passively evolved luminosities.
