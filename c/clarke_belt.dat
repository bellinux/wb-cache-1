50|$|Author Arthur C. Clarke is {{credited}} with proposing the notion of using a geostationary orbit for communications satellites. The orbit {{is also known as}} the Clarke Orbit. Together, the collection of artificial satellites in these orbits is known as the <b>Clarke</b> <b>Belt.</b>|$|E
50|$|Videocon d2h has 10, 54 MHz transponders on Satellite ST-2. Videocon d2h is aligned at 88° East on the <b>Clarke</b> <b>Belt.</b> Videocon d2h uses MPEG-4 technology, which permits high {{compression}} for video and DVB-S2 technology, which allows more efficient transmission of satellite signals.|$|E
5000|$|The stationary-orbit {{region of}} space {{is known as}} the <b>Clarke</b> <b>Belt,</b> named after British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, who {{published}} the idea in Wireless World magazine in 1945. A stationary orbit is sometimes referred to as a [...] "fixed orbit".|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, a {{satellite}} in retrograde orbit {{could pose a}} major hazard to other satellites, especially if it {{was placed in the}} <b>Clarke</b> <b>belt,</b> where geostationary satellites orbit. This risk highlights the fragility of communication satellites and the importance of international cooperation in preventing space collisions due to negligence or malice.|$|E
50|$|Astra 23.5°E is a {{group of}} Astra {{communications}} satellites co-located at the 23.5° east position in the <b>Clarke</b> <b>Belt</b> owned and operated by SES based in Betzdorf, Luxembourg. 23.5° east {{is one of the major}} TV satellite positions serving Europe (the others being at 19.2° East, 13° East, 28.2° East, and 5° East).|$|E
50|$|Astra 31.5°E is {{the name}} for the group of Astra {{communications}} satellites co-located at the 31.5° east position in the <b>Clarke</b> <b>Belt</b> {{owned and operated by}} SES based in Betzdorf, Luxembourg. 31.5° east is SES' newest orbital location serving Europe (the others being at 19.2° east, 28.2° east, 23.5° east, and 5° east).|$|E
50|$|Westar 1 (launched on April 13, 1974) has the {{distinction}} of being the USA's first commercially launched geosynchronous communications satellite, following North America's first geosynchronous communications satellite, Canada's Anik A1 in 1972. Westar 1 was put into orbit at 99° W in the <b>Clarke</b> <b>belt</b> (99° W now being the home of Galaxy 16).|$|E
50|$|Astra 2D {{is one of}} the Astra {{communications}} satellites {{owned and}} operated by SES, and located at 28.2° east in the <b>Clarke</b> <b>Belt</b> till June 2015. It is a Hughes HS-376 craft, and was launched from the Guiana Space Centre in December 2000 to join Astra 2A and Astra 2B at 28.2°E, where it remained for its active life.|$|E
50|$|Astra 5°E is {{the name}} for the Astra {{communications}} satellites co-located at the 5° east position in the <b>Clarke</b> <b>Belt</b> which are {{owned and operated by}} SES based in Betzdorf, Luxembourg. 5° east {{is one of the major}} TV satellite positions serving Europe (the others being at 19.2° east, 28.2° east, 13° east, and 23.5° east).|$|E
50|$|Eutelsat 33C (formerly Eurobird 1 and Eutelsat 28A) is a Eutelsat {{operated}} Eurobird satellite, {{used primarily}} for digital television. It {{was launched in}} March 2001, and after a short period testing at 33°E, joined Eutelsat 2F4 at 28.5°E in the <b>Clarke</b> <b>Belt,</b> just {{within the range of}} satellite dishes pointed at SES' Astra 2 satellites at 28.2° east. It moved to 33° east and joined Eutelsat 33B in July 2015.|$|E
50|$|Antennas {{are placed}} {{according}} to customer specifications, which normally involves {{a distance of}} 200 m between antennas. This {{is to ensure that}} antennas do not shade each other and that their electromagnetic noise and radio noise do not interfere with each other. Locations are chosen to maximize satellite pass durations, view a calibration station on Hiorthhamnfjellet, provide visibility of the <b>Clarke</b> <b>Belt</b> for geostationary satellite antennas, or visibility to Isfjord Radio for terrestrial communications antennas.|$|E
50|$|Any {{satellites}} in areostationary orbit {{will likely}} suffer from increased orbital station keeping costs, because the <b>Clarke</b> <b>belt</b> of Mars lies between {{the orbits of}} the planet's two natural satellites. Phobos has a semi-major axis of 9,376 km, and Deimos has a semi-major axis of 23,463 km. The close proximity to Phobos in particular (the larger of the two moons) will cause unwanted orbital resonance effects that will gradually shift the orbit of areostationary satellites.|$|E
50|$|Clarke {{contributed to}} the {{popularity}} of the idea that geostationary satellites would be ideal telecommunications relays. He first described this {{in a letter to the}} editor of Wireless World in February 1945 and elaborated on the concept in a paper titled Extra-Terrestrial Relays - Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?, published in Wireless World in October 1945. The geostationary orbit is now sometimes known as the Clarke Orbit or the <b>Clarke</b> <b>Belt</b> in his honour.|$|E
5000|$|The {{asteroid}} {{had a close}} {{approach to}} the Earth on May 29, 2012, approaching to only ~8950 miles / ~14,440 km above the planet's surface. This means 2012 KT42 came inside the <b>Clarke</b> <b>Belt</b> of geosynchronous satellites. As of May 28, 2012, the estimated 5 to 10 meter wide asteroid ranked #6 on the top 20 list of closest-approaches to Earth. There was no danger of a collision during the close approach. [...] would pass roughly [...] from Venus on 2012 July 8.|$|E
50|$|Ground {{stations}} transmit {{signals to}} the satellites which are 35,786 kilometers (22,236 miles) above the Equator in <b>Clarke</b> <b>belt</b> orbits. The satellites send the signals back down to radio receivers in cars and homes. This signal contains scrambled broadcasts, along with meta data about each specific broadcast. The signals are unscrambled by the radio receiver modules, which display the broadcast information. In urban areas, ground repeaters enable signals to be available even if the satellite signal is blocked. The technology allows for nationwide broadcasting, so that, for instance US listeners can hear the same stations anywhere in the country.|$|E
5000|$|The {{notion of}} a {{geostationary}} space station equipped with radio communication was published in 1928 by Herman Potočnik. The first appearance of a geostationary orbit in popular literature {{was in the first}} Venus Equilateral story by George O. Smith, but Smith did not go into details. British science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke disseminated the idea widely, with more details on how it would work, in a 1945 paper entitled [...] "Extra-Terrestrial Relays — Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?", published in Wireless World magazine. Clarke acknowledged the connection in his introduction to The Complete Venus Equilateral. The orbit, which Clarke first described as useful for broadcast and relay communications satellites, is sometimes called the Clarke Orbit. Similarly, the <b>Clarke</b> <b>Belt</b> is the part of space about 35786 km above sea level, in the plane of the equator, where near-geostationary orbits may be implemented. The Clarke Orbit is about 265000 km in circumference.|$|E
