Accordingly, the paper presents an employee performance appraisal conceptual framework including the role of contextual factors, where strategic human resources management plays a key role. Moreover, the model includes two sets <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> and <b>representative</b> basic performance criteria, as well as a new category of profile performance criteria as the foundation for developing flexible, customized and meaningful employee performance appraisal systems and processes aimed at improving individual and organizational overall performance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To employ {{retrospective}} {{trend analysis}} {{in an attempt}} to provide a layered description of the relative contribution (per <b>credential)</b> <b>of</b> clinical athletic trainers (those without terminal degrees) to authoring scientific literature in the Journal of Athletic Training (JAT). From these data, our secondary purpose was to evaluate trends relative to changes in journal policy and increased educational rigor or professional limitations over the past decade, discussing how they may affect the potential for clinical athletic trainers to contribute to JAT. Design: Exploratory study design with trend analysis. Participants: Data collection and analysis included a trend evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> clinical athletic trainer authors in JAT and the teams (by <b>credential)</b> <b>of</b> authorship to determine the <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> authors who published in JAT...|$|R
40|$|Much <b>of</b> the {{existing}} <b>procedural</b> justice literature {{is based on}} incomplete or inadequate conceptualizations and operationalizations of the multiple dimensions <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> justice. Thus, many studies fail to adequately tap into the multiple domains of the several dimensions <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> justice. This failure may have resulted in studies which reported non-significant results or underestimated the true effect size <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> justice on employee reactions. In addition, the multiple dimensions <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> justice may differ in how they predict employee behaviors. Further, these multiple dimensions may differ in their importance across different contexts. To remedy this problem, this study begins by carefully explicating 15 dimensions <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> justice and specifies a domain of observable measures related to each dimension. These multiple dimensions are linked to Leventhal 2 ̆ 7 s (1980) theoretical work on the dimensions <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> justice. In addition, a three-stage model which captures the multiple dimensions <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> justice is proposed. The proposed framework integrates previous operationalizations <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> justice within a single conceptually coherent framework. Second, the multi-dimensional nature <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> justice was explored using factor analytic and other statistical techniques. Third, this study tested whether the multiple dimensions differentially predict employee turnover intentions and avoidable turnover intentions. In addition, data suggest that procedural justice is related to employees willingness to recruit for their employers. ...|$|R

50|$|Procedural {{justice is}} the idea of {{fairness}} in the processes that resolve disputes and allocate resources. One aspect <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> justice is related to discussions of the administration of justice and legal proceedings. This sense <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> justice is connected to due process (U.S.), fundamental justice (Canada), procedural fairness (Australia), and natural justice (other Common law jurisdictions), but the idea <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> justice can also be applied to nonlegal contexts in which some process is employed to resolve conflict or divide benefits or burdens. Other aspects <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> justice can also be found in social psychology and sociology issues and organizational psychology.|$|R

Institutions {{at the level of}} society and fair procedures are shown to be sources <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> utility, and novel empirical evidence on the role <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> utility in important areas of the economy, polity and society is presented. procedural utility, outcome utility, institutions, procedural fairness, outcome fairness, intentions...|$|R

This exploration will help us understand the larger debate regarding the neutrality <b>of</b> <b>procedural</b> rules and to make connections to similar debates in other areas of law, particularly constitutional law...|$|R
