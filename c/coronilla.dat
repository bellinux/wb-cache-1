25|$|The area {{in front}} of the fort is {{characterized}} by low bush or garrigue and by vegetation that can withstand drought as a result of low nutritional requirements. Plants include strawberry tree, <b>coronilla,</b> euphorbia, heathers, gorse and myrtle. In the winter, the anemone, asphodel, brassica, honeysuckle, crocus, and rock rose bloom. Near the castle, there are some Aleppo pines. Indeed, in 1901, Munthe planted a pine forest, part of which was lost during the fires of 1972 and 1987.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of species within many genera of leguminous plants, e.g. Astragalus, <b>Coronilla,</b> Hippocrepis, Indigofera, Lotus, Securigera and Scorpiurus, produce {{chemicals}} that derive from the compound 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA, beta-nitropropionic acid). The free acid 3-NPA is an irreversible inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, and thus the compound inhibits the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This inhibition caused by 3-NPA is especially toxic to nerve cells and represents a very general toxic mechanism suggesting a profound ecological importance due to the big number of species producing this compound and its derivatives. A second and closely related class of secondary metabolites that occur in many species of leguminous plants is defined by isoxazolin-5-one derivatives. These compounds occur in particular together with 3-NPA and related derivatives {{at the same time}} in the same species, as found in Astragalus canadensis and Astragalus collinus. 3-NPA and isoxazlin-5-one derivatives also occur in many species of leaf beetles (see defense in insects).|$|E

60|$|Trifolium pratense.--One hundred flower-heads {{on plants}} {{protected}} by a net did not produce a single seed, whilst 100 heads on plants growing outside, which were visited by bees, yielded 68 grains weight of seeds; and as eighty seeds weighed two grains, the 100 heads must have yielded 2720 seeds. I have often watched this plant, and have never seen hive-bees sucking the flowers, except from the outside through holes bitten by humble-bees, or deep down between the flowers, as if in search of some secretion from the calyx, almost {{in the same manner}} as described by Mr. Farrer, in the case of <b>Coronilla</b> ('Nature' 1874 July 2 page 169). I must, however, except one occasion, when an adjoining field of sainfoin (Hedysarum onobrychis) had just been cut down, and when the bees seemed driven to desperation. On this occasion most of the flowers of the clover were somewhat withered, and contained an extraordinary quantity of nectar, which the bees were able to suck. An experienced apiarian, Mr. Miner, says that in the United States hive-bees never suck the red clover; and Mr. R. Colgate informs me that he has observed the same fact in New Zealand after the introduction of the hive-bee into that island. On the other hand, H. Muller ('Befruchtung' page 224) has often seen hive-bees visiting this plant in Germany, for the sake both of pollen and nectar, which latter they obtained by breaking apart the petals. It is at least certain that humble-bees are the chief fertilisers of the common red clover.|$|E
6000|$|The {{excretion}} of a sweet fluid by glands seated {{outside of}} a flower is rarely utilised {{as a means for}} cross-fertilisation by the aid of insects; but this occurs with the bracteae of the Marcgraviaceae, as the late Dr. Cruger informed me from actual observation in the West Indies, and as Delpino infers with much acuteness from the relative position of the several parts of their flowers. (10/51. 'Ult. Osservaz. Dicogamia' 1868-69 page 188.) Mr. Farrer has also shown that the flowers of <b>Coronilla</b> are curiously modified, so that bees may fertilise them whilst sucking the fluid secreted from the outside of the calyx. (10/52. 'Nature' 1874 page 169.) It further appears probable from the observations of the Reverend W.A. Leighton, that the fluid so abundantly secreted by glands on the phyllodia of the Australian Acacia magnifica, which stand near the flowers, is connected with their fertilisation. (10/53. 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' volume 16 1865 page 14. In my work on the 'Fertilisation of Orchids' and in a paper subsequently published in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' {{it has been shown that}} although certain kinds of orchids possess a nectary, no nectar is actually secreted by it; but that insects penetrate the inner walls and suck the fluid contained in the intercellular spaces. I further suggested, in the case of some other orchids which do not secrete nectar, that insects gnawed the labellum; and this suggestion has since been proved true. Hermann Muller and Delpino have now shown that some other plants have thickened petals which are sucked or gnawed by insects, their fertilisation being thus aided. All the known facts on this head have been collected by Delpino in his 'Ult. Osserv.' part 2 fasc. 2 1875 pages 59-63.) ...|$|E

They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine {{consists}} of a long, narrow, little contorted corridor, that follows the leaf margin at some distance. After a moult the corridor gradually widens considerably, generally into a wide corridor, more rarely into a real blotch. The frass in the initial corridor is deposited in a narrow, interrupted, central line. In the wider part, it is deposited in a thick lump with little, narrow interruptions. Pupation takes place outside of the mine.|$|E

50|$|Medina Hernández {{is from a}} {{small town}} called Los Reyes Mezontala, Puebla, which has been a pottery-making {{community}} since its founding. It is a Mixtec community near the Cerro <b>Coronillas</b> mountain which provides black and reddish clay. She learned the trade from her parents, making pots, comals, storage containers and other utilitarian items. She currently works with her family to make many of these same pieces, but has become known for a particular style of storage jar of her invention, called a “biznaga” or barrel cactus. This is the most popular piece, created in the shape of this plant, including the corrugated sides, all shaped by hand. The pieces are shaped and dried, the piece is burnished with a gourd shell and some receive a coating of white or one of a rust color. Then it is polished again so that it shines after firing. The larger pieces can be dyed in a boiling bath using plants such as cuaxiote or palo mulato. Firing is done above ground with the pots covered in wood another fuel which is set alight.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports on}} new and {{previously}} known data on insufficiently studied fauna of aphids living on flowering plants in Krasnoyarsk region, {{the main part}} of a vast geographical province named Central or Middle Siberia, depending on terminology used by authors of literature sources. From physical geography viewpoint, the surveyed territory belongs to the Yenisey river basin. Aphids are an ecologically and morphologically diverse group of insects included in 11 families of the suborder Aphidinea in insect fauna of Russian Federation and 25 families in the world’s fauna. Geographical location, dates of collection of aphid colonies are presented with identification of species-specific feeding preferences. First found in Siberia were Symydobius nanae, Euceraphis betulae, Cavariella cicutae, C. konoi, Uroleucon (Dactynotus) aeneum, U. giganteum, U. nigrocampalulae, U. trachelii, Aphis agrimoniae, A. <b>coronillae,</b> A. mongolica, A. neothalictri, A. pruni, A. pseudocomosa, A. pulsatillae, A. sambuci, A. (Debilisiphon) umbelliferarum. Collected for the first time from willow were Betacallis comes (normally feeds on birch and alder), B. quadrituberculata (common on birch), colonies of Metopeurum fuscoviride were first found on Achillea millefolium. Aphis craccivora was previously collected from plants of different families, but was never seen on Cruciferae (Capsella bursa­pastoris). Aphis frangulae was concidered to feed exclusively on buckthorn, however, it was found on Chamaenerion angustifolium. Judging on diversity of host species, some aphids may be more important for agriculture than it was previously thought.
