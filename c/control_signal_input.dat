40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} of a static aberration control algorithm based on the linear relation be- tween mean square of the aberration gradient and the second moment of point spread function for the generation of <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> <b>input</b> for a deformable mirror (DM). Results presented {{in the work of}} Yang et al. 1 suggested a good feasibility of the method for correction of static aberration for point and extended sources. However, a practical realisation of the algorithm has not been demonstrated. The goal {{of this article is to}} check the method experimentally in the real conditions of the present noise, finite dynamic range of the imaging camera, and system misalignments. The experiments have shown strong dependence of the linearity of the relationship on image noise and overall image intensity, which depends on the aberration level. Also, the restoration capability and the rate of convergence of the AO system for aberrations generated by the deformable mirror are experi- mentally investigated. The presented approach as well as the experimental results finds practical application in compensation of static aberration in adaptive microscopic imaging system.

40|$|This thesis {{treats the}} subject of {{applying}} human motion models to create estimators for the input signals of human operators controlling a telerobotic system. In telerobotic systems, the <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> <b>input</b> by the operator is often treated as a known quantity. However, there are instances where {{this is not the}} case. For example, a well-studied problem is teleoperation under time delay, where the robot at the remote site does not have access to current operator input due to time delays in the communication channel. Another is where the hardware sensors in the input device have low accuracy. Both these cases are studied in this thesis. A solution to these types of problems is to apply an estimator to the input signal. There exist several models that describe human hand motion, and these can be used to create a model-based estimator. In the present work, we propose the use of the minimum jerk (MJ) model. This choice of model is based mainly on the simplicity of the MJ model, which can be described as a fifth degree polynomial in the cartesian space of the position of the subject's hand. Estimators incorporating the MJ model are implemented and inserted into control systems for a teleoperatedrobot arm. We perform experiments where we show that these estimators can be used for predictors increasing task performance in the presence of time delays. We also show how similar estimators can be used to implement direct position control using a handheld device equipped only with accelerometers. QC 2010081...|$|E
40|$|Two key components, {{the pulse}} {{generator}} and optical signal demultiplexer, {{needed for the}} implementation of all-optical soliton-based local area and wide area networks are investigated. The technology of generating a bright soliton pulse train from a sinusoidal pulse train produced as the beat signal of two distributed feedback laser diodes passed through a so-called comblike fiber structure is developed. A design methodology for this structure is discussed, and using this approach a soliton pulse source is constructed generating 1553 nm pulses at a repetition rate of 50 GHz, with pulses of full width at half maximum of 2. 0 ps. The fiber structure used to generate the bright soliton pulse train employs the lowest average power for the beat signal ever reported in the literature, and the shortest length of fiber. The same structure (with a different design) is also used to produce a 47. 6 GHz dark soliton pulse train with a full width at half maximum of 3. 8 ps. This is the first reported use of this structure to generate dark solitons. It is shown that the comblike dispersion profile fiber structures may also be exploited for soliton pulse compression producing widths as short as 200 fs. Two approaches to implementation of optical signal demultiplexing are discussed. These are the nonlinear optical loop mirror (NOLM) and the separation of multilevel time division multiplexed signal pulses in the frequency domain by exploiting the relationship between the pulse's energy (i. e. pulse amplitude and width) and the Raman self-frequency shift. A modification of the NOLM scheme is investigated where feedback that adjusts the power of the control signal (by controlling the gain of an erbium-doped fiber amplifier introduced into the <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> <b>input</b> path) is employed to make the structure insensitive to the state of polarization of the signal and control pulses. In order to better understand the physical phenomena exploited in optical fiber soliton transmission and the above schemes, two experiments are conducted to measure the fiber nonlinear ratio (n 2 /Aeff) and the Raman time constant (TR) in single-mode fibers at 1550 nm. The fiber nonlinear ratio was measured for standard telecommunication fiber, dispersion shifted fiber, and dispersion compensating fiber. A value of 3. 0 fs for the Raman time constant was measured and is recommended for soliton pulse propagation modeling in single-mode optical fibers...|$|E

A data <b>signal</b> <b>input</b> on one port of the TOAD is split onto two optical paths, each including one NLE. The optical paths converge at an output port. To start a switching window, a first <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> is <b>input</b> on an optical path that includes {{only one of the}} two NLEs.

Similar to other Earth observation (EO) sensors, the calibration and validation of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy sensors is a fundamental underpinning activity.
