40|$|Objectives This {{research}} {{aimed to}} look in depth at the factors affecting the ability of four Sure Start local programmes, based in a multicultural Midlands city, to engage with ‘hard-to-reach’ populations. Methods A variety of research strategies and methods were employed. Geographical information systems, participatory research methods and interviews were used {{in order to understand}} the extent of the challenge, and hear first hand, why parents may not get involved with Sure Start. The mapping exercise involved collation and mapping of postcode data with respect to boundaries and potential and actual users of Sure Start services. This made possible the identification of any geographical patterning in the distribution of service users and non-users. Participatory research methods were used with parents, enabling them to <b>conduct</b> <b>short</b> <b>interviews</b> within their own communities and make sense of the data collected. Interviews were also conducted with 70 parents across the city, recruited through local schools. Results The results indicate that parental decisions regarding Sure Start are the product of a complex interaction between numerous factors which may act as either barriers or facilitators to service utilization. Conclusions The results suggest that a multi-method approach to data collection is useful and appropriate in gaining access to those parents who are non-users of the Sure Start services and enabling their voices to be heard. These findings offer some explanations and insight into the apparent ambivalent attitudes of some families toward Sure Start services. Implications for future practice are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Voting is fundamental to our democratic system, and federal law generally requires polling places to be accessible to all eligible voters, including those with disabilities. In response, states and localities have implemented provisions and practices addressing the accessibility of polling places. However, during the 2000 federal election, GAO found that only 16 percent of polling places had no potential impediments to access for people with disabilities. To address these and other issues, Congress enacted the Help America Vote Act of 2002, which required polling places {{to have at least}} one voting system accessible for people with disabilities. However, the extent to which state and local practices have improved accessibility is unknown. To respond to this issue, GAO determined (1) the proportion of polling places that have features in the path to the voting area that might facilitate or impede access to voting for people with disabilities and how these results compare to our findings from the 2000 federal election and (2) the proportion of polling places that have features in the voting area that might facilitate or impede private and independent voting for people with disabilities. To do this work, GAO visited randomly selected polling places across the country, which were representative of polling places nationwide, on Election Day 2008 to observe features and voting methods that could impede access and to <b>conduct</b> <b>short</b> <b>interviews</b> with polling place officials. GAO also reviewed relevant laws and documentation. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} a literature review of participatory monitoring and existing PMRV approaches to identify strategies and conditions {{that support the}} development and implementation of sustainable PMRV in the REDD+ context. To identify data and processes that should be included in PMRV, we reviewed MRV requirements in the REDD+ context. The literature is analyzed to summarize the lessons learned from participatory monitoring, examine when, where and how PMRV has been developed and implemented, and identify any knowledge gaps. With Indonesia as our case study, we explored the feasibility of PMRV implementation and assessed how PMRV could be integrated into the national MRV system. We examined the proposed national MRV system in Indonesia, compiled a database of REDD+ projects and <b>conducted</b> <b>short</b> <b>interviews</b> with selected project proponents...|$|R

50|$|Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness is a documentary/art film {{released}} in June 2015 that takes audiences through farms and urban landscapes in Japan, South Korea, and the United States, interviewing leading practitioners in the Natural Farming movement. The film began when an environmental artist (Patrick M. Lydon) and an environmental book editor (Suhee Kang), {{had a chance}} meeting in Seoul, South Korea, and began <b>conducting</b> <b>short</b> <b>interviews</b> together with leaders in the ecology and social justice movements. Upon meeting Korean farmer Seong Hyun Choi however, the two were so impressed by his ecological mindset and way of working, that {{they set out to}} produce a feature film about the movement. Lydon and Kang ended up quitting their jobs, giving away most of their possessions, and becoming voluntarily homeless for four years in order to afford producing the film.|$|R

40|$|The {{proposed}} study {{explores the}} cognitive miser approach to perception formation in job interviews, {{as well as}} factors that may motivate people to not act as cognitive misers. Personality type (introverted and extraverted) and gender are characteristics {{of people that are}} associated with many stereotypes (Heilman, 2001; Andersen 2 ̆ 6 Klatzky, 1987), and can have a large influence on an employer’s perception of an applicant, particularly when the employer is acting as a cognitive miser. It is hypothesized that in longer interviews, employers will be motivated to not act as cognitive misers, because they have more information about the applicant, have more of an opportunity to disconfirm any biases they may hold about the applicant, and experience greater liking toward the applicant. To test this, participants will conduct interviews with job applicants (who are actually confederates) and rate their perceptions of the applicants’ expected job performance. Participants will either conduct a long or <b>short</b> <b>interview</b> with a male introvert, a female introvert, a male extravert, or a female extravert. Job applicants will provide participants with the same information, although the information about personality type and the amount of information given will depend on the condition. It is predicted that participants who <b>conduct</b> <b>shorter</b> <b>interviews</b> will rate the applicants in line with popular stereotypes that favor extraverts over introverts, and males over females. Conversely, participants in longer interviews will be motivated to thoroughly think through their evaluations of the applicants, {{and there will be no}} significant difference in their ratings of male extraverts, female extraverts, male introverts, and female introverts...|$|R
2500|$|The new {{presenting}} {{team would}} take turns hosting (initially usually in pairs but sometimes solo), and would often introduce acts in an out-of-vision voiceover over the song's instrumental introduction. They would sometimes even <b>conduct</b> <b>short</b> informal <b>interviews</b> with the performers, and initially the Top 10 countdown was run without any voiceover. Rules relating to performance were also altered meaning acts had to sing live {{as opposed to}} the backing tracks for instruments and mimed vocals for which the show was known. To incorporate the shift of dominance towards American artists, more use was made of out-of-studio performances, with acts in America able to transmit their song to the Top of the Pops audience [...] "via satellite". These changes were widely unpopular and much of the presenting team were axed within a year, leaving the show hosted solely by Dortie and Franklin (apart from the Christmas Day editions, when both presenters appeared) from October 1992, on a week-by-week rotation.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the opening}} sequence, Colbert most often {{proceeds}} with a run-through of recent headlines {{in a manner}} parodying traditional news broadcasts; {{this is similar to}} The Daily Show but with a faux-right-wing spin. The program typically continues with Colbert addressing a specific topic. Colbert often calls to [...] "Jimmy", a reference to program director Jim Hoskinson, to roll video clips. That topic will often lead into a [...] "The Word" [...] segment, which juxtaposes Colbert's commentary with satirical bullet points on-screen, a parody of The O'Reilly Factors [...] "Talking Points Memo". On occasion he will <b>conduct</b> a <b>short</b> <b>interview</b> with someone {{having to do with the}} topic. The format of the middle segment varies, but it is normally a visual presentation or skit. Often, these skits are parts of recurring segments, which may include [...] "Better Know a District", in which Colbert interviews a U.S. Representative from a certain district of the United States; [...] "Tip of the Hat/Wag of the Finger", in which Colbert voices his approval or disapproval of prominent people and news items; [...] "Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A.", a health segment; [...] "The Sport Report" [...] with the [...] "t" [...] in both Sport and Report silent, a sports segment; and [...] "The ThreatDown", in which Colbert lists the five greatest threats to America, and others. His newest segment, [...] "Thought for Food" [...] deals with the consumption of specific foods across the world.|$|R
40|$|As they grow, {{children}} go through different phases {{of growth and}} development, and very often due to various unspecified outside influences, they are overloaded with weight. Heavy backpacks and its correlation to different types of bad posture, as well as pain in particular parts of the back, {{has been an important}} issue in the past several years. The aim of this research was to determine average backpack weight in correlation to children’s weight in primary school. Also, the aim was to determine if there were some differences between pupils of the first, second, third, and fourth grade of primary school. Further on, it aimed at answering the question whether there was some correlation between the already determined relative backpack weight and the mentioned pain intensity while carrying the backpack. The research was conducted on a sample of 252 primary school pupils (boys and girls). Body weight and backpack weight were measured, and a <b>short</b> <b>interview</b> was also <b>conducted.</b> The <b>short</b> <b>interview</b> concerned feelings, intensity and pain location while carrying and the way they carry the backpack. The results indicate that the average values of the correlation between the backpack weight and the body weight (%) compared with the maximum allowed limit of 10 %, in all grades, are in average (16. 72 %) over the limit, resulting with the maximum rate of 29. 17 % in grade 1. Out {{of the total number of}} pupils, 93. 1 % responded that they carry the backpack on both shoulders. Out of the whole sample, 87 (31. 4 %) of them said that they feel pain while carrying the backpack. The majority (18. 4 %) of subjects felt pain in their lower back. The youngest children in this sample, more precisely, those in grade 1, felt the most pain of high intensity, which is probably due to the fact that their backpack, compared to their body weight, was too heavy...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Psychodynamic conceptualizations {{consider}} addiction as {{a solution}} away from the psychic realm and the social bond to deal with overwhelming arousal. Ambulant psychotherapy has shown low levels of effectiveness for this population. In contrast, outcome studies in drug free Therapeutic Communities (TC’s) {{have proven to be}} effective in providing a drug free changed lifestyle, but the treatment process in these self-help group programs stays misunderstood. In this systematic single case study we investigate how the disruptive affect regulation in a TC resident is restricted by the interventions of the peer community and led towards more verbalized ways of dealing with arousal. Methods: The Clinical Diagnostic Interview and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems- 32 have been administered both at {{the beginning and the end}} of the treatment process. Besides this, every two weeks the first author <b>conducted</b> a <b>short</b> <b>interview</b> on the resident’s TC experiences. Fluctuations in subjective well-being and affect regulation were linked to TC interventions using thematic analysis on the clinical material. Results: The results illustrate how interventions at the level of the peer community succeed in restricting dysfunctional patterns of affect regulation, what allows the person to deal with subjective issues of his traumatic childhood. Discussion: The changing process in a TC resident indicates that interventions aimed at restricting dysfunctional patterns of affect regulation are a necessary condition to make people suffering from addiction responsive to ‘psychotherapeutic’ treatment. The TC program will be discussed within a psychodynamic conceptual framework. Strengths and limitations of the study will be considered...|$|R
