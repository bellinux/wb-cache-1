We show that, alternatively, frequent cross-species transmission of PLV, coupled with a tendency for more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> primate <b>species</b> to exchange viruses "successfully," can result in apparent codivergence.

5|$|A {{study in}} 1993 by Segawa et al. {{revealed}} that the population of S.lessoniana in Okinawa may actually be composed of three distinct species. This was confirmed in genetic studies by Izuka et al. in 1994. Triantafillos and Adams in 2005 also showed that S.lessoniana in Shark Bay, Australia is composed of two species. These findings indicate that S.lessoniana may actually comprise several very similar and <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>species.</b> It is now believed that S.lessoniana is a cryptic species complex.|$|E
5|$|Johann Georg Wagler {{gave the}} species its current {{binomial}} name in 1832 when he erected the new genus Eudocimus, whose only other species is the scarlet ibis (E.ruber).

5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>species</b> has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E
5|$|During evolution, some {{structures}} {{may lose}} their original function and become vestigial structures.

Examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth, the coccyx, the vermiform appendix, and other behavioural vestiges such as goose bumps and primitive reflexes.|$|E

5|$|Gonopods {{occur in}} a {{diversity}} of shapes and sizes, and {{in the range from}} closely resembling walking legs to complex structures quite unlike legs at all. In some groups, the gonopods are kept retracted within the body; in others they project forward parallel to the body. Gonopod morphology is the predominant means of determining species among millipedes: the structures may differ greatly between <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>species</b> but very little within a species. The gonopods develop gradually from walking legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity.|$|E
5|$|In North America, C.violaceus favours conifers, and, though rare {{over much}} of the continent, is {{relatively}} common in certain areas, including Mount Rainier National Park and Olympic National Park. It is more common in old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest, though has sprung up in regrowth areas populated with fir, pine, aspen and alder in the Great Lakes region. Fruit bodies occur singly or in small groups, often near rotting wood, and can grow in fairy rings. <b>Closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>species</b> that look like C.violaceus can be found in Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, some {{possible}} close relatives of Ferugliotherium were discovered.

Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues described a p4 from the La Colonia Formation (Late Cretaceous of Argentina) as a new multituberculate genus, Argentodites, in 2007, but Gurovich and Beck noted close similarities between this p4 and the p4 in the possible jaw fragment of Ferugliotherium and suggested that it represented Ferugliotherium or a <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>species.</b> A single mf1 from the Allen Formation (Late Cretaceous of Argentina) was described as another ferugliotheriid genus, Trapalcotherium, in 2009.|$|E
