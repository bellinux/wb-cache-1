40|$|Promoting {{balanced}} {{regional development}} has been a long-term public policy objective ever since {{the establishment of the}} Congested Districts Boards {{at the turn of the}} century. However, although Regional Development Organisations were set up in 1969, there has not been a clearly articulated strategy for regional policy. The only clear semblance of a regional policy which can be identified is the existence of measures such as regionally differentiated industrial grants, devised in an attempt to influence the spatial dispersion of mobile investment, and the <b>Compensatory</b> <b>Allowance</b> <b>Scheme</b> (“headage” payments) in the case of agriculture which is targeted towards the so-called disadvantaged areas...|$|E
40|$|Two new {{enforcement}} instruments As of January 2009, Dutch municipalities {{can make}} use of two new instruments for out-of-court settlements of public order violations: the ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikking overlast’ and the ‘bestuurlijke boete overlast’. These instruments give local law enforcers the authority to issue an penalty for minor punishable offences such as stray dogs, dog droppings, household waste dumps or violation of other local bylaws. In {{the case of the}} ‘bestuurlijke boete’ the municipality is responsible for the administrative process. In the case of the ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikking overlast’, the municipality sends the written charge (‘proces-verbaal’) to the Central Fine Collection Agency (‘Centraal Justitieel Incassobureau or CJIB) after which the CJIB sends a copy of the charge with a giro payment slip to the accused. If the accused refuses to pay the penalty, the case is submitted to the public prosecutor for further judgement. After that, the case can be brought to court. If the fine is paid, the case will not be evaluated by the public prosecutor. Evaluation Three years after the introduction of both instruments, this evaluation has been conducted. To what extent have both instruments been implemented by municipalities? What are the results of the instruments and of the financial <b>compensatory</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>scheme?</b> To answer these questions, DSP-groep has conducted research from November 2011 to April 2012 for the Scientific Research and Documentation Center (WODC) of the Ministry of Security and Justice. The legal framework and the legal and political reasoning resulting in the introduction of both instruments has been studied by Prof. Mr. Dr. Arthur Hartmann of Erasmus University, Rotterdam. DSP-groep conducted the rest of the research: a survey among Dutch municipalities in which 301 municipalities participated (72 % response), in-depth interviews with 23 representatives of six municipalities and representatives of the CJIB, the Central Processing Unit of the Public Prosecution Service (CVOM) and the Ministries of Security and Justice and the Ministry of the Interior. In addition, DSP-groep has performed a quantitative analysis on a database containing all ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikkingen overlast’ issued between early 2009 and February 2012 (over 50. 000 cases). The CVOM has analysed all cases that have been evaluated by the Public Prosecution Service and cantonal judges. An independent committee has supervised the progress and quality of the research. The survey among Dutch municiplaities is part of this dataset. The in-depth interviews, and the database containing all ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikkingen overlast’ are not available...|$|E

50|$|The {{first public}} {{assistance}} scheme {{was first introduced}} in 1971 {{as the foundation of}} Hong Kong's social security system. Prior to 1971 the social relief was largely confined and temporary. The Social Welfare Department only came into existence in 1958 and the government restricted its role and stressed the role of family in social welfare, as it emphasised in the first White Paper on Social Welfare published in 1965 which argued for a strengthened family to support its member. Long term plans in social welfare were introduced in the 1970s with double in social spending per capita between 1971 and 1974. Modeled from the British National Assistance Act, the 1971 public assistance scheme indicated the willingness of the government to take care the basic needs of those who are infirm and ill, which has not changed significantly throughout the years. Together with the Social <b>Allowance</b> <b>Scheme</b> (today known as Social Security <b>Allowance</b> <b>Scheme)</b> introduced in 1973, they have been the major components of Hong Kong's social security system. Throughout the 1980s, the total spending on social welfare was between 4.5 to 6.5% of the government's budget and the social security spending was about 0.57% of the gross domestic product.|$|R
