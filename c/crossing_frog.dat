50|$|In the United Kingdom {{points and}} {{crossings}} using chaired bullhead rail would be referred to using a letter and number combination. The letter would define the length (and hence the radius) of the switch blades and the number would define {{the angle of the}} <b>crossing</b> (<b>frog).</b> Thus an A7 turnout would be very short and likely only to be found in tight places like dockyards whereas an E12 would be found as a fairly high speed turnout on a mainline.|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} to {{regulate}} the depth of flangeways in a <b>crossing</b> <b>frog,</b> the Federal Railroad Administration created rules which, by definition, prohibited the use of flange-bearing frogs on track with speed limits greater than 10 mph. Because of this, an FRA waiver is required to install full flange-bearing diamonds. Subsequent to installation, an extensive battery of inspections of both the diamond itself, and rail vehicles which cross the diamond, to ensure that safety is not compromised by the installation of such a diamond. This may change in the future, as FBF becomes a proven technology, but currently the rigorous inspections are a deterrent for widespread installation of full flange-bearing diamonds.|$|E

50|$|Full flange-bearing diamond frogs {{are also}} used in diamond crossings. These frogs are flange-bearing for both lines through the diamond. Because both lines are flange-bearing, {{there is no need}} to elevate the flanges of {{vehicles}} using one line, as there is in the case of OWLS diamond frogs, which allows for greater gauge restraint. Consequently, vehicles can <b>cross</b> these <b>frogs</b> at the maximum speed allowed by the track design; regardless of which line on which they cross the diamond. Though there are very few of these in use today, full flange-bearing diamonds can be found where two high-speed or high-tonnage main lines must cross one another at-grade.|$|R

40|$|Using {{artificial}} fertilization, I <b>crossed</b> <b>frogs</b> {{from different}} populations to evaluate fitness {{consequences for the}} offspring from an inbreeding-outbreeding perspective, and to evaluate quantitative genetic effects on immunocompetence against a fungal pathogen (Saprolegnia). Crosses between closely situated populations of different sizes generated contrasting results {{for the effects of}} outbreeding on offspring traits between populations and life history stages, emphasizing the importance of epistatic effects and the difficulties of relying on generalizations when making conservation decisions (e. g., regarding translocations). Experimental infection of frog eggs from six populations with Saprolegnia fungus showed a significant family effect on the degree of infection of eggs and embryos, in particular at lower fertilization success and with a significant temperature × population interaction effect. A paternal genetic effect on fungus resistance was found using a half-sib split design. Furthermore, relatively more eggs were infected when fertilized by sperm from the same, in contrast with a different population. However, there was no evidence for a stronger effect in isolated island populations. Although the mechanistic underpinnings remain unknown, these results suggest substantial levels of genetic variation in resistance to Saprolegnia in natural populations within and among populations. We also found that pre-hatching exposure to Saprolegnia dramatically reduced the size at metamorphosis in the absence of further exposure to the fungus, possible as a delayed effect of impaired embryonic development. However, in contrast to some other amphibians, induced hatching in response to Saprolegnia could not be confirmed. In conclusion, the results suggest that frog populations are genetically diverse even at small geographic scale with frequently strong and unpredictable consequences of in- and outbreeding for the response to stressors...|$|R

40|$|A wheel {{passing a}} {{crossing}} nose: Dynamic analysis under high axle loads using {{finite element model}}ling* Martin Pletz 1, 2, Werner Daves 1, 2 and Heinz Ossberger 3 A finite element model for the process of a wheel passing a crossing is presented. In the dynamic model, one wheel, the wing rails and the <b>crossing</b> nose (<b>frog)</b> are modelled. The bogie, the complete wheel set {{and the support of}} the crossing are represented as a system consisting of masses, springs, dampers and friction-generating elements. The rolling/sliding behaviour between the wheel and crossing is studied using the proposed model. Due to the conical shape of the wheel tread and multiple contacts between the wheel and the crossing parts, sliding occurs during the transition of the wheel from the wing rail to the crossing nose or vice versa. At the same time, an impact occurs that produces high contact forces. The parameters of the model are the train speed and passing direction, the wheel and the crossing geometry, the axle load and the support of the crossing. In this paper, the crossover process is studied for high axle loads and compared with results of simulations using a normal axle load. Further parameters are three train velocities, both directions of passing and different crossing materials. The loading of the crossing nose is calculated for all cases (axle load, train speed and direction) and materials...|$|R

Oscar Hertwig first achieved artificial parthenogenesis in frogs in 1911, using eggs fertilized by irradiated sperm.

Gunther Hertwig repeated this experiment in 1924, using <b>crosses</b> between different <b>frogs.</b> A <b>cross</b> between a toad, Amietophrynus regularis, and a frog, Rana fusca, would not produce a viable embryo, but fertilization of a toad egg by an irradiated frog sperm would produce a haploid larva.

[...] This method produced tadpoles which metamorphosed into adult frogs, some of which were albino.Rana japonica, Pelophylax nigromaculatus and Lithobates pipiens have all produced viable haploid adults as a result of artificial parthenogenesis.|$|R

Densitometer tracings of starch gels stained for 6 phosphogluconate and isocitrate dehydrogenases, expected to be heterozygous in a particular cross, demonstrated that the triploids had twice as much maternal as paternal gene product for each locus, similar to patterns found in triploids produced by nuclear transplantation...|$|R
