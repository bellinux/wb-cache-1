40|$|Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a {{geographically}} expanding {{prion disease}} of wild and captive cervids in North America. Disease {{can be transmitted}} directly, animal to animal, or indirectly via the environment. CWD contamination can occur residually in the environment via soil, water, and forage following deposition of bodily fluids such as urine, saliva, and feces, or by the decomposition of <b>carcasses.</b> Recent <b>work</b> has indicated that plants may even take up prions into the stems and leaves. When a carcass or gut pile {{is present in the}} environment, a large number of avian and mammalian species visit and consume the carrion. Additionally, predators like coyotes, likely select for disease-compromised cervids. Natural cross-species CWD transmission has not been documented, however, passage of infectious prion material has been observed in the feces of crows. In this study we evaluated the ability of CWD-infected brain material to pass through the gastrointestinal tract of coyotes (Canis latrans) following oral ingestion, and be infectious in a cervidized transgenic mouse model. Results from this study indicate that coyotes can pass infectious prions via their feces for at least 3 days post ingestion, demonstrating that mammalian scavengers could contribute to the translocation and contamination of CWD in the environment...|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate {{the use of a}} custom-made heat pipe to reduce muscle temperature in beef carcasses during the initial part of the refrigeration period post slaughter. The effects of muscle depth (Experiment 1) and radial distance from a heat pipe (Experiment 2) were investigated initially. Then the use of multiple heat pipes was compared with no heat pipes for the loin and hind leg regions of a carcass (Experiment 3). All three {{experiments were}} conducted at a commercial beef abattoir in Western Australia. Without heat pipes, the time taken for the temperature to fall to 35 °C in the hind leg was 10, 90 and 300 min for depths of 25, 50 and 100 mm from the surface, respectively. Temperature increased with radial distance from a heat pipe and the relative differences in temperature between different positions increased with time. Temperatures 110 min after the commencement of cooling were 35. 7, 36. 8 and 38. 3 °C for 20, 40 and 80 mm from the heat pipe, compared with 39. 8 °C without the pipe. The loin cooled faster than the rump, which cooled faster than the leg. Heat pipes increased the rate of temperature loss in the leg but not the loin. The time taken for the leg temperature to reach 35 °C, measured at a depth of 100 mm, reduced from 150 to 76 min. These experiments confirm that heat pipes containing methanol could be used to increase the rate of heat loss from leg muscles in beef <b>carcasses.</b> Further <b>work</b> is required to determine if the magnitude of these increases in cooling rate would improve eating quality for large carcasses...|$|R

Coliform counts obtained by this technique were statistically analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to select the optimum sampling sites on the carcass and to assess contamination of the carcass by gut flora at a particular establishment. There was a large variation between sites and between works. In general, works 3 and 4 produced cleaner <b>carcasses</b> than <b>works</b> 2, which in turn was cleaner than works 1. Works 1, 2 and 4 used conventional dressing techniques and works 3 used the inverted dressing method, therefore, the coliform counts found at works 3 and 4 are achievable regardless of dressing technique. Coliform bacteria were most concentrated around the posterior pelvic rim and less prevalent at the carcass extremities. The posterior pelvic rim (sites 3 and 4) had higher (P < 0. 05) coliform counts than the exterior ventral flank area (sites 5, 6, 7 and 8), which in turn had higher (P < 0. 05) counts than the proximal hind and proximal fore limbs (sites 1, 2, 9 and 10) across all works.

60|$|Tarzan then {{descended from}} the tree, {{dispatched}} those that were not already dead and proceeded to skin the <b>carcasses.</b> As he <b>worked,</b> rapidly and with great skill, he neither hummed nor whistled as does the average man of civilization. It was in numerous little ways such as these that he differed from other men, due, probably, to his early jungle training. The beasts of the jungle {{that he had been}} reared among were playful to maturity but seldom thereafter. His fellow-apes, especially the bulls, became fierce and surly as they grew older. Life was a serious matter during lean seasons--one had to fight to secure one's share of food then, and the habit once formed became lifelong. Hunting for food was the life labor of the jungle bred, and a life labor is a thing not to be approached with levity nor prosecuted lightly. So all work found Tarzan serious, though he still retained what the other beasts lost as they grew older--a sense of humor, which he gave play to when the mood suited him. It was a grim humor and sometimes ghastly; but it satisfied Tarzan.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pseudo {{three dimensional analysis}} to predict the indentation rolling resistance of belt conveyors. Conventional methods used to analyse the indentation rolling resistance problem typically assume a bottom cover of uniform thickness bonded to a rigid substrate with no consideration of the <b>carcass</b> properties. This <b>work</b> aims to analyse {{the influence of the}} carcass construction and configuration for steel cord conveyor belts and predict the influence on the indentation rolling resistance. Due to the presence of steel cords embedded in the conveyor belt, the pressure distribution at the interface between the belt and a conveyor idler roll is not uniform. To solve this problem, a static three dimensional finite element model was developed to determine the pressure distribution and reaction forces transmitted through the belt to the conveyor idler roll. The reaction loads are then used in a two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model to determine the indentation rolling resistance for the steel cord belt. This paper investigates the influence of the conveyor belt carcass and bottom cover properties on the resulting stress distribution throughout the belt and consequently on the indentation rolling resistance. The influence of the steel cord diameter and pitch, applied load, bottom cover thickness and strain rate is investigated. A finite element method is detailed for the analysis of the stress distribution throughout the belt. A range of carcass configurations is investigated and experimental verification of the calculated stress distribution undertaken using a Tekscan™ pressure measurement system...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Siwaliks came to {{be known}} {{worldwide}} since the discovery in 1830 of a great ape in the Miocene molasses of the Potwar. One century later, pebble tools, flakes and handaxes attracted Prehistorians. A re-reading of the Yale-Cambridge Expedition in India (1935), during which Ramapithecus brevirostris was discovered, reveals that stone tools were discovered in the Upper Pliocene gravels of the Soan Basin. Since 2003, the National Museum of Natural History (France) and the Society for Archaeological and Anthropological Research (India) have conducted fieldwork in the northwestern Indian Siwaliks. The Quranwala Zone of Masol, the core of the Chandigarh anticline (Punjab), is well known for its Late Pliocene fauna rich in Hexaprotodon, Cholossochelys, Stegodon, bovids and Hipparion with the occurrence of Equus and Elephas. Fifty hectares have been surveyed during eight field seasons (2008 to 2015) with the discovery of choppers and marks on bones of the Quranwala Zone faunal assemblage, all collected on recent outcrops of the Latest Pliocene. This paper presents the historical context and the rigorous scientific process, which has led to the acknowledgment that some bones, dating back to the Latest Pliocene, present intentional and precise cut marks made by sharp edges in quartzite and an intelligence, which knew the anatomy of the bovid <b>carcasses.</b> Our pluridisciplinary <b>works</b> support anthropic activities 2. 6 Ma ago in the sub-Himalayan floodplain and the probability of finding hominin fossils in the Quranwala Zone.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to test the effects of animal age on {{consumer}} perceptions of sheep meat quality. Experiment 1 tested eating quality scores (tenderness, liking of flavour, juiciness and overall liking) derived from untrained consumers of grilled M. longissimus lumborum (LL) or M. biceps femoris (BF) derived from Merino ewes ranging from 8. 5 to 68. 5 months of age. The ewes were derived from one farm and all received a pelleted diet (60 % hay, 30 % lupin grain and 10 % barley grain) that sustained growth between 118 and 173 g/day for at least 22 days pre-slaughter. In experiment 2 consumer testing of grilled LL and roasted BF and M. semimembranosis (SM) was conducted on a commercial line of 12 -month-old White Suffolk x Merino lambs (0 erupted incisor teeth) v. a line of Merino yearling sheep about 22 months old (with either 2 or 4 erupted incisor teeth). The results of experiment 1 showed a significant effect of muscle (LL>BF, P< 0. 001) and a cubic effect of animal age on the consumer scores for grilled steaks. The cubic relationship was due to meat from lamb (8. 5 months) and hogget (20 months) having higher scores than those of older animals. There was a close relationship between the objective measures of tenderness and the consumer tenderness score (r 2 = 0. 53, P< 0. 001). Results of experiment 2 indicated {{no significant difference between}} the grilled LL for the crossbred lamb and 22 -month-old (2 - 4 teeth) Merino yearling sheep. However, the consumer scores for the roasted BF and SM were significantly depressed in the 2 - 4 tooth yearling Merino categories. In conclusion, this work clearly underpins the current Australian definition of lamb, lamb having better eating-quality attributes than older animals with fully erupted permanent incisor teeth, particularly in muscles from across the <b>carcass.</b> However, this <b>work</b> also highlights the eating quality attributes of older sheep (6 or more permanent incisor teeth) particularly for the LL, and suggests that negative influences of flavour associated with older sheep meat are minimal when the product is served in the absence of subcutaneous and intermuscular fat. Finally, the results suggest the possibility of a new 'yearling' sheep meat category based on animals in the 2 - 4 -tooth dentition category...|$|R
40|$|The {{nutritional}} {{and social}} stress are important {{factors that affect}} the neuro-endocrine and immune result {{in an increase in}} energy expenditure in animals by affecting the productive and reproductive performance. This thesis focused on certain aspects of this question, taking into consideration the porcine species, that is of great zootechnical interest, but also presents the various types of breeding, needs absolutely different. The common thread that unites this study is given by cytokines, a group of proteins secreted by various cell types which have a variety of functions. For a long time the term cytokine has been associated with immune cells; in the last twenty years, it has been discovered a new tissue seat active production of these factors, the adipose tissue. Adipose tissue has long been traditionally considered as a tissue dedicated to the storage of energy. However, already in the 50 s Kennedy postulated the existence of a factor produced by adipocytes able to act centrally by inhibiting food intake and increasing energy expenditure, when the body weight exceeds the so-called threshold value. The discovery, in 1994, by Zhang (Zhang et al., 1994) of the ob gene and its gene product, leptin, has induced the study of the mechanism of homeostatic regulation of body weight and obesity. In fact, the axis leptin has proved much more complex than expected, and in the years studies on adipose tissue have multiplied leading to consider the adipose tissue as an endocrine organ. As a result of the increasing attention devoted to the study of adipose tissue in recent years, the current understanding of the biology of adipocytes and their role in physiology and pathology has greatly improved. In the veterinary field, the interest born around this tissue has a double feature. The first, along with human medicine, linked to the aspect of obesity that afflicts pets. The second concerns the physiology to understand how the adipose tissue and {{what is the role of}} the molecules it produces, to improve zootechnical productions. In fact, adipose tissue is involved in the regulation of the immune and endocrine systems and the factors expressed by adipocytes are related to the quality of animal products. The genetics of pork meat quality is the subject of research and its study is now essential to meet the demands of conscious consumer organoleptic quality of the products. The meat quality is influenced by a large number of factors and the adipose tissue is able to adjust the composition of the <b>carcass.</b> So, my <b>work</b> has focused on an important species, the swine. The first part of this thesis focused on the characterization of the adipose tissue of the pig "Nero di Parma" for the good qualities of some of his commercial cuts (lardo, culatello). I evaluated the characteristics of the adipose tissue, the fatty acid composition, comparing it with that coming from commercial breeds. I have analyzed the expression of some adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin, inflammatory cytokines and not, receptors and transcription factors involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. In a second step, I focused the research on other phases of the production cycle because, at least in an intensive farming, these factors related to the immune system, have a significant economic impact and health. While the pig “Nero di Parma” is raised in the wild and therefore in compliance with the social habits of the species, in intensive breeding animals are present in stressful situations. One of the greatest moments of social stress and nutrition is the period of weaning, with the shift from breast milk to the food dry that causes serious changes to morpho-functional of the gastrointestinal system. My study therefore investigated neuroendocrine and immune status in piglets during lactation and after weaning and evaluated supplementation with nucleotides can improve its ability to respond to stress. The last aspect that I faced in this species has been focused on sows in gestation. Unlike the pregnant females from other species, sows are subject to rationing and can not satisfy the hyperphagia typical gestation pregnancy as excessive adiposity at birth has adverse effects not only on the vitality of piglets but also on the feeding behavior of sows during the subsequent lactation. Moreover, if the production performance of the subjects is already determined in the womb, it is interesting to study the levels of leptin in these subjects and understand what could be the role of this hormone in these subjects...|$|R
