40|$|DE 102008029272 A 1 UPAB: 20100112 NOVELTY - The {{crankshaft}} has {{a stroke}} bearing element (2) for supporting a connecting rod. A <b>crank</b> <b>cheek</b> (3) connects a crank bearing element (1) to the stroke bearing element. A joint (4) between the <b>crank</b> <b>cheek</b> and the bearing elements is formed outside a transient area (5) of a cylindrical lateral contour of the bearing elements and an outer contour of the <b>crank</b> <b>cheek</b> running angularly to the lateral contour. A circulating bar (6) is formed at the crank bearing element and/or stroke bearing element, where axial {{width of the}} circulating bar is larger than cross-section of the <b>crank</b> <b>cheek.</b> USE - Crankshaft for a reciprocating piston engine i. e. internal-combustion engine (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The construction of the <b>crank</b> <b>cheek</b> and the bearing elements enables economical production of the crankshaft. The joint between the <b>crank</b> <b>cheek</b> and the bearing elements is formed outside the transient area of the cylindrical lateral contour of the bearing elements and the outer contour of the <b>crank</b> <b>cheek</b> running angularly to the lateral contour, thus geometrically separating the joint from the transient area, which is highly loaded during operation of the crankshaft, such that danger of cracking of the joint during welding or loading is reduced, and hence obtaining improved firmness and bending duration loading capacity. The <b>crank</b> <b>cheek</b> is designed with reduced weight, thus optimizing fringe pattern of the <b>crank</b> <b>cheek...</b>|$|E
2500|$|The <b>crank</b> <b>cheeks</b> {{were used}} as main bearing journals, and were [...] in diameter. This was {{necessary}} to keep the crankshaft length {{the same as the}} 1A-1500 engine so that 1A-1500 components could be used, and to keep the weight as low as possible. The single piece crankcase was designed to save weight and give maximum strength, but made assembly of the engine difficult. The engine was finished by August 1927.|$|R
