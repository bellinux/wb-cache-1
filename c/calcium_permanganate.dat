Also {{the firm of}} Hellmuth Walter at Kiel had been commissioned by the RLM to build a rocket engine for the He 112, so there were two different new rocket motor designs at Neuhardenberg: whereas von Braun’s engines were powered by alcohol and liquid oxygen, Walter engines had hydrogen peroxide and <b>calcium</b> <b>permanganate</b> as a catalyst.

50|$|Z-Stoff was a {{name for}} <b>calcium</b> <b>{{permanganate}}</b> or sodium permanganate mixed in water. It was normally used {{as a catalyst for}} T-Stoff (high test peroxide) in military rocket programs by Nazi Germany during World War II.|$|E
50|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>permanganate</b> is an {{oxidizing}} agent and chemical compound with the chemical formula Ca(MnO4)2. It {{consists of the}} metal calcium and two permanganate ions. It is noncombustible, but, being a strong {{oxidizing agent}}, it will accelerate the burning of combustible material. If the combustible material is finely divided, the resulting mixture may be explosive. Contact with liquid combustible materials may result in spontaneous ignition. Contact with sulfuric acid may cause fires or explosions. Mixtures with acetic acid or acetic anhydride can explode if not kept cold. Explosions can occur when mixtures of <b>calcium</b> <b>permanganate</b> and sulfuric acid {{come into contact with}} benzene, carbon disulfide, diethyl ether, ethyl alcohol, petroleum, or other organic matter.|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this document {{is a series of}} statistically designed tests {{to examine the relationship between}} the four responses of interest and five precipitation parameters affiliated with the new precipitation scheme. The four responses are precipitate filterability, strontium decontamination, americium decontamination, and plutonium decontamination. The precipitation parameters were the initial sodium concentration of the waste, the initial hydroxide level of the waste, and the amounts of <b>calcium,</b> strontium, and <b>permanganate</b> introduced. Experiments were also performed to evaluate the impact of other process parameters such as temperature, timing of permanganate addition, and presence of entrained solids on the proposed precipitation scheme. The objective of these experiments was to determine the primary variables that influence filterability, Sr- 90 decontamination, and TRU decontamination using actual 241 -AN- 102 waste...|$|R
40|$|Three {{commonly}} used techniques, namely {{atomic absorption spectrophotometry}} (AAS-Ashing and AAS-Non Ashing) and titrimetry (potassium permanganate titration) have been evaluated in this study to determine the calcium content in six food samples whose calcium levels ranged from 0 to more than 250 mg/ 100 g sample dry matter (DM) basis. An {{attempt was made to}} evaluate these three techniques of analysis for all different levels on the basis of accuracy, precision, reproducibility of results, simplicity of operation, economy, speed, sensitivity, specificity, and safety. Results show that AAS-Ashing is the most reliable technique for calcium determination as it is most accurate and detects more calcium compared to the other two techniques. Moreover, independent of <b>calcium</b> levels, potassium <b>permanganate</b> titration proved to be the second most reliable method and determinations could be made more precisely, but it suffered from interference by other ions. AAS-Non Ashing proved to be the least accurate technique of analysis. The latter technique, however requires the shortest sample preparation procedure...|$|R
50|$|The engine's fuel {{chemistry}} used 80% {{hydrogen peroxide}} or 'T-Stoff'. This was a 'cold cycle' engine; the peroxide {{acted as a}} monopropellant and was decomposed by a catalyst into superheated steam and oxygen. The catalyst used was a consumable liquid solution of <b>calcium</b> <b>permanganate</b> or 'Z-Stoff'. As this catalyst is consumed, the engine {{is regarded as a}} bipropellant engine.|$|E

50|$|Late in 1936 Erich Warsitz was {{seconded}} by the RLM to Wernher von Braun and Ernst Heinkel, {{because he}} had been {{recognized as one of the}} most experienced test-pilots of the time, and because he also had an extraordinary fund of technical knowledge. In 1937, working closely with Wernher von Braun, Erich Warsitz undertook the initial flight testing of the Heinkel He 112 fitted with von Braun’s rocket engine. Despite the wheels-up landing and having the fuselage on fire, it proved to official circles that an aircraft could be flown satisfactorily with a back-thrust system through the rear.In parallel the RLM had suddenly acquired an interest in so-called rocket boosters fitted for the sake of simplicity below the wings of a heavily loaded bomber to cut down the length of runway needed for take-off from small aerodromes and airfields. Once in the air the spent booster casings would be dropped by parachute for re-use. The firm of Hellmuth Walter at Kiel handled this development. The first standing trials and tests flights of their boosters were also held at Neuhardenberg using an Heinkel He 111E placed at disposal by Heinkel. Walter had also been commissioned by the RLM to build a rocket engine for the He 112, so there were two different new rocket motor designs at Neuhardenberg: whereas the von Braun’s engines were powered by alcohol and liquid oxygen, Walter engines had hydrogen peroxide and <b>calcium</b> <b>permanganate</b> as a catalyst.

All those test flights at Neuhardenberg were made by Erich Warsitz.|$|E
40|$|Chick embryo mitochondria, {{studied with}} the {{electron}} microscope, show crista-free areas of low electron opacity. These areas are observable after fixation with osmium tetroxide, <b>calcium</b> <b>permanganate,</b> potassium permanganate, formaldehyde, acrolein, acrolein followed by osmium tetroxide, uranyl acetate followed by <b>calcium</b> <b>permanganate,</b> and acetic acidalcohol. Staining of sections with lead hydroxide or uranyl acetate, or with both, {{resulted in an}} increased density of a fibrous material within these areas. The appearance of the fibrous structures varied with the fixative employed; after fixation with osmium tetroxide the material was clumped and bar-like (up to 400 A in diameter), whereas after treatment of osmium tetroxide-fixed tissues with uranyl acetate before dehydration the fibrous structures could be visualized as 15 to 30 A fibrils. Treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) in place of uranyl acetate coarsened the mitochondrial fibrils. After fixation with <b>calcium</b> <b>permanganate</b> or potassium permanganate, or a double fixation by uranyl acetate followed by <b>calcium</b> <b>permanganate,</b> the fibers appeared to have a pattern and ultrastructure similar to that observed after the osmium tetroxide-uranyl acetate technique, except {{that some of them}} had a slightly greater diameter (up to 50 A). Other fixatives did not preserve the fibers so well. The fibers appeared strongly clumped by formaldehyde fixation, and were difficult to identify after fixation with acrolein or acetic acid-alcohol, The staining of nucleic acid-containing structures by uranyl acetate and lead hydroxide was improved by treatment of osmium tetroxide-fixed sections with hydrogen peroxide, and the mitochondrial fibers also had an increased density in the electron beam after this procedure. The staining characteristics suggest the fibrous material of chick embryo mitochondria to be a nucleic acid-containing structure, and its variable appearance after different fixations parallels that previously reported, or described in this paper, for the nucleoplasm of bacteria and blue-green algae. The results, in addition to those described in the accompanying communication, indicate that these mitochondria contain DNA...|$|E
