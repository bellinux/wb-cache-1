5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong sound design. Several reviewers also gave {{high marks for}} the game's Autovista mode. Some critics expressed frustration with Kinect features, and others also felt that the game was not enough of an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3. These critics did, however, <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game was a vast improvement over Forza Motorsport 3.|$|E
5|$|After VVKJ acceptance, a {{group of}} pilots {{conducted}} 16 mock dogfights between the IK-2 and the Hawker Fury I biplane already in service with the VVKJ, during which the IK-2 displayed overall superiority over the British-built aircraft. At one point, Bajdak declared his continuing doubts about the aircraft, and Dobnikar challenged him to a duel, with Bajdak flying his preferred aircraft, the Fury I. After Dobnikar won the climbing competition and a race to Zemun and back from Belgrade, the final dogfight forced Bajdak to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> IK-2 was the better aircraft. On 20 November 1937, the VVKJ submitted a proposal to order a batch of 12 IK-2s, which was approved the following month. The production version included some additional improvements, but continued testing resulted in further delays, with the aircraft not entering service for another year. By this time, international consensus had coalesced around {{the superiority of the}} low-wing monoplane, and the IK-2 was already obsolescent {{by the time it was}} delivered to VVKJ fighter units.|$|E

In the keynote speech at a 2007 conference hosted by the Association for the Study of Peak Oil in Cork, Schlesinger said that oil industry executives now privately <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world faces an imminent oil production peak. In his 2010 ASPO-USA keynote speech, Schlesinger observed that the Peak Oil debate was over. He warned of political inaction as a major hindrance, like those in Pompeii before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.|$|E
25|$|Romney's budget {{proposals}} included savings he anticipated achieving by {{restructuring the}} state government. On announcing his 2004 budget proposal, {{he said that}} through improving efficiency by reorganizing the state bureaucracy, along with reducing waste and fraud, he would save $2 billion. Democratic legislators and independent analysts called that estimate vastly overdrawn. The Massachusetts Taxpayer Foundation, a nonpartisan, business-funded organization that monitors state finances, suggested the figure might have been closer to $100 million, and Romney himself was eventually forced to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> $2 billion figure {{could not be reached}} without new revenue.|$|E
25|$|Atwater and her husband, Michael Haas, an {{emergency}} room physician at a local hospital, filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, represented by Charles Lincoln, alleging that the city violated her Fourth Amendment right {{to be free from}} unreasonable seizures by arresting her for a crime whose only punishment was a fine. This argument required her to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police had probable cause to arrest her for violating the seat belt law, and thus the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas found summary judgment for the city. A panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that arresting a person for a fine-only misdemeanor was per se unreasonable. The Fifth Circuit sitting en banc reversed the panel, agreeing with the district court's reasoning. Three judges dissented from the en banc panel's ruling, arguing that the police had to have a specific reason for arresting Atwater for only violating the seat belt law. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.|$|E

25|$|From {{publication}} {{until about}} 1700, few astronomers were convinced by the Copernican system, though {{the book was}} relatively widely circulated (around 500 copies {{of the first and}} second editions have survived, which is a large number by the scientific standards of the time). Few of Copernicus' contemporaries were ready to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Earth actually moved, although Erasmus Reinhold used Copernicus' parameters to produce the Prutenic Tables. However, these tables translated Copernicus' mathematical methods back into a geocentric system, rejecting heliocentric cosmology on physical and theological grounds. The Prutenic tables came to be preferred by Prussian and German astronomers. The degree of improved accuracy of these tables remains an open question, but their usage of Copernican ideas led to more serious consideration of a heliocentric model. However, even forty-five years after the publication of De Revolutionibus, the astronomer Tycho Brahe {{went so far as to}} construct a cosmology precisely equivalent to that of Copernicus, but with the Earth held fixed in the center of the celestial sphere instead of the Sun. It was another generation before a community of practicing astronomers appeared who accepted heliocentric cosmology.|$|E
500|$|Eragon {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} and {{was criticized for}} its derivative nature. Liz Rosenberg of The New York Times Book Review criticized Eragon for having [...] "clichéd descriptions", [...] "B-movie dialogue", [...] "awkward and gangly" [...] prose." [...] However, she concluded the review by noting that [...] "for all its flaws, it is an authentic work of great talent". School Library Journal wrote that in Eragon [...] "sometimes the magic solutions are just too convenient for getting out of difficult situations". Common Sense Media called Eragons dialogue [...] "long-winded" [...] and [...] "clichéd", with a plot [...] "straight out of Star Wars by way of The Lord of the Rings, with bits of other great fantasies thrown in here and there." [...] The website did <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> book is a notable achievement for such a young author, {{and that it would}} be [...] "appreciated" [...] by younger fans.|$|E

In 2012, DeLonge would <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> recording method, originally his idea, {{led to a}} loss of unity, noting that e-mails dictated the majority of recording of the record, due to the hectic schedules of the band. [...] "There's some songs on there that I love, {{but for the most part}} it was disconnected," [...] Barker recalled. [...] "It was like, 'You do this part in your studio, and then you're gonna play on it and send it back to me.' When we're not in the studio together, you don't have the opportunity to gel off each other." [...] In addition, Barker was still recovering from his 2008 plane crash, which made things difficult in the studio. [...] "Dude, I was still healing," [...] he told Rolling Stone. [...] "I had scabs all over my body and was, like, a bloody mess. It was just way too soon." ...|$|E

500|$|The breeds of toy spaniel often rivalled the Pug in {{popularity}} as lapdogs for ladies. The disadvantage of the breeds of toy spaniel was that their long coats required constant grooming. By 1830, the toy spaniel had changed somewhat from the dogs of Charles II's day. William Youatt in his 1845 study, The Dog, was not enamoured of the changes: [...] "The King Charles's breed {{of the present}} day is materially altered for the worse. The muzzle is almost as short, and the forehead as ugly and prominent as the veriest bull-dog. The eye is increased to double its former size, and has an expression of stupidity with which {{the character of the}} dog too accurately corresponds." [...] Youatt did <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> breed's long ears, coat and colouring were attractive. Due to the fashion of the period, the toy spaniels were crossed with Pugs {{to reduce the size of}} their noses and then selectively bred to reduce it further. By doing this, the dog's sense of smell was impaired, and according to 19th century writers, this caused the varieties of toy spaniel to be removed from participation in field sports. Blunt-Lytton proposed that the red and white Blenheim Spaniels always had the shorter nose now seen in the modern King Charles.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 study {{published}} in Tax Notes by the Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University and Dr. Laurence Kotlikoff [...] estimated the FairTax would be revenue-neutral for the tax year 2007 {{at a rate of}} 23.82% (31.27% tax-exclusive). The study states that purchasing power is transferred to state and local taxpayers from state and local governments. To recapture the lost revenue, state and local governments would have to raise tax rates or otherwise change tax laws in order to continue collecting the same real revenues from their taxpayers. The Argus Group and Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics each published an analysis that defended the 23% rate. While proponents of the FairTax <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> above studies did not explicitly account for tax evasion, they also claim that the studies did not altogether ignore tax evasion under the FairTax. These studies presumably incorporated some degree of tax evasion in their calculations by using National Income and Product Account based figures, which is argued to understate total household consumption. The studies also did not account for capital gains that may be realized by the U.S. government if consumer prices were allowed to rise, which would reduce the real value of nominal U.S. government debt. [...] Nor did these studies account for any increased economic growth that many economists researching the plan believe would occur.|$|E

Edwards was sentenced to a year's probation and agreed to testify for prosecutors in charges against ACORN and against Busefink. Busefink appealed her case to the Nevada Supreme Court, challenging the constitutionality of the statute.

2500|$|Since Logroño is a pro-independence supporter, most statehooders see Eleuterio as an {{offensive}} character, {{and point to}} Logroño as having a covert agenda against the movement. Logroño counters by stating that he doesn't have to write a script for his character since, as his occasional mentor José Miguel Agrelot said constantly, [...] "the world is the best scriptwriter", and merely observing older statehood supporters in Puerto Rico provides him of enough original material. Logroño also claims that some of Eleuterio's criticism against some traditional customs within Puerto Rican culture, such as impunctuality, actually has a positive effect.

[...] "Presumably, societal norms with respect to pagers are as developed as they will ever be." [...] Nor could it see work-related employer-issued pagers or other devices being used for self-expressive purposes as Kennedy suggested, since they were functionally no {{different from any other}} such item a police department might issue to officers, [...] "much like a police officer's patrol cruiser or sidearm".

2500|$|The CIA: a {{forgotten}} history, by William Blum and [...] by Tim Weiner have accused the CIA of various covert actions, {{and human rights}} abuses. The CIA has responded to the claims made in Weiner's book, and Jeffrey T. Richelson of the National Security Archive has also been critical of it. Intelligence expert David Wise faulted Weiner for portraying Allen Dulles as [...] "a doddering old man" [...] rather than the [...] "shrewd professional spy" [...] he knew and for refusing [...] "to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> agency's leaders may have acted from patriotic motives or that the CIA ever did anything right," [...] but concluded: [...] "Legacy of Ashes succeeds as both journalism and history, and it is must reading for anyone interested in the CIA or American intelligence since World War II."

2500|$|Berlusconi {{had made}} disparaging remarks about Finnish cuisine during {{negotiations}} {{to decide on}} the location of the European Food Safety Authority in 2001.

The Italian ambassador in Helsinki was summoned by the Finnish foreign minister. One of Berlusconi's ministers later 'explained' the comment by saying that [...] "anyone who had seen a picture of Halonen must have been aware that he had been joking". Halonen took the incident in good humour, retorting that Berlusconi had [...] "overestimated his persuasion skills". The Finnish pizza chain Kotipizza responded by launching a variety of pizza called Pizza Berlusconi, using smoked reindeer as the topping.
