5|$|Pepper saw {{much success}} in playing for Bethlehem; after unimpressive beginnings, {{he went on}} {{to play a major role}} in {{securing}} many titles for the side, including four American Cups, three National Challenge Cups and two National Association Football League triumphs. Becoming captain for the 1918 and 1919 campaigns, success continued until his abrupt departure in 1920. Pepper's career became somewhat volatile, signing for four amateur teams within the space of four years; all of which failed to match his record at Bethlehem. Retirement saw him remain prominent in local sporting and steel-working culture in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, in-time becoming a <b>corn</b> <b>merchant</b> until his death in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Octavia Hill was the {{daughter}} of James Hill, <b>corn</b> <b>merchant,</b> follower of Owenism and banker, and his third wife, Caroline Southwood Smith. He had been widowed twice, and had six children (five daughters and a son) from his previous marriages. He had been impressed by the writings on education of Caroline Southwood Smith, {{the daughter}} of Dr Thomas Southwood Smith, a pioneer of sanitary reform. He had engaged Caroline as a governess for his children in 1832, and they were married in 1835, three years before Octavia was born in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, her father's eighth daughter and ninth child. The family's comfortably prosperous life was disrupted by James Hill's financial problems and his mental collapse. In 1840 he was declared bankrupt. Caroline Hill's father gave the family financial support, and took on some of Hill's paternal role. Southwood Smith was a health and welfare reformer concerned with a range of social issues including child labour in mines and the housing of the urban poor. Caroline Hill held similar views on social reform, and her interest in progressive education, influenced by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, and Southwood Smith's daily experience in his work at the London Hospital in the East End inspired Octavia Hill's concern for the poorest in early Victorian London. She received no formal schooling: her mother educated the family at home.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{was born}} in Newcastle upon Tyne, at 9 Pleasant Row, Shieldfield, {{about a mile from}} the city centre. Although the house in which he was born no longer exists, an inscribed granite tablet marks the spot on which it once stood. At that time the area, next to the Pandon Dene, was rural. His father, also called William, was a <b>corn</b> <b>merchant</b> on the Newcastle quayside, who rose through the ranks of Newcastle society to become mayor of the town in 1850. An elder sister, Anne, born in 1802, was named after his mother, the {{daughter}} of Addison Potter.|$|E
25|$|Cradock's family {{background}} {{was one of}} respectable middle class trade; her ancestors included the Pecheys (<b>corn</b> <b>merchants</b> and churchmen), the Vallentines (distillers) and the Hulberts (cabinet makers).

25|$|Fowler {{was born}} in Melksham, Wiltshire. His father, John Fowler senior was a wealthy Quaker merchant, who had married Rebecca Hull, and {{together}} they had three daughters and five sons, of whom Fowler was the third son. When he left school Fowler followed his father’s wishes and began working for a local <b>corn</b> <b>merchant,</b> but when he {{came of age in}} 1847 he turned his back on the corn business and joined the engineering firm of Gilkes Wilson and Company of Middlesbrough. Amongst other things, the company was involved in building steam locomotives and colliery winding engines. The company built a number of locomotives for the Stockton and Darlington Railway.|$|E
500|$|Headingley Castle, {{also known}} for {{a good deal of}} the 19th century as The Elms, was {{designed}} in about 1841 on land that had been owned by Barbara Marshall. It was built [...] between 1843 and 1846 by the local architect John Child for the <b>corn</b> <b>merchant</b> Thomas England. The estate was originally 22 acres. While the exterior of Headingley Castle is Victorian Gothic in style, the architect employed modern building techniques and materials including cast iron in its construction.|$|E
500|$|Maintaining certain friendships {{following}} his playing days, Pepper liaised {{with the likes}} of Bethlehem manager William Sheridan, and teammates Johnny Rollo and Robert Morrison well into the 1940s; the latter, according to Morrison's nephew, identified Pepper by his [...] "ugly little mug". Alike his time in England, Frederick was also involved in trade union business, becoming a leading member of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) by at least 1937; he is known to have recruited successfully, given that Bethlehem suffered particular economic depravity during the Great Depression, an event that affected public attendance to matches throughout the 1920s. Following this, he worked as a self-employed <b>corn</b> <b>merchant</b> until his death on 12 June 1950; he was survived by his 20-year old adoptive daughter, his wife died several years before him.|$|E
50|$|Sanders {{was born}} in Bristol on 12 January 1799, and educated mainly at a school run by Thomas Exley. For a time he and a brother were in {{partnership}} as <b>corn</b> <b>merchants,</b> but he retired from business to concentrate on scientific work. He was elected Fellow of the Geological Society in 1839, and Fellow of the Royal Society in 1864.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{the second}} son of Thomas Lougher of Llandaff, and Charlotte née Lewis, {{daughter}} of a farmer from Radyr.

5000|$|She {{was born}} Louise Ruth Wolpert in Königsberg, East Prussia (now Kaliningrad), {{and brought up}} in Berlin. Her father was a Russian-speaking Latvian Jew and a wealthy textile merchant; her mother, also Jewish, a German-speaking Lithuanian {{from a family of}} rich <b>corn</b> <b>merchants.</b> She was nicknamed [...] "Lisl" [...] by an aunt, from which she derived Elisabeth, the name she later adopted for herself.|$|R
500|$|Shaw {{was born}} at 3 Upper Synge Street in Portobello, a lower-middle-class part of Dublin. He was the {{youngest}} child and only son of George Carr Shaw (1814–1885) and Lucinda Elizabeth (Bessie) Shaw (née Gurly; 1830–1913). His elder siblings were Lucinda (Lucy) Frances (1853–1920) and Elinor Agnes (1855–1876). The Shaw family was of English descent and belonged to the dominant Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland; George Carr Shaw, an ineffectual alcoholic, was among the family's less successful members. His relatives secured him a sinecure in the civil service, from which he was pensioned off in the early 1850s; thereafter he worked irregularly as a <b>corn</b> <b>merchant.</b> In 1852 he married Bessie Gurly; {{in the view of}} Shaw's biographer Michael Holroyd she married to escape a tyrannical great-aunt. If, as Holroyd and others surmise, George's motives were mercenary, then he was disappointed, as Bessie brought him little of her family's money. She came to despise her ineffectual and often drunken husband, with whom she shared what their son later described as a life of [...] "shabby-genteel poverty".|$|E
2500|$|Thornewill {{graduated}} from Cambridge University in 1858 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He went into {{business as a}} <b>corn</b> <b>merchant</b> in Liverpool and became well-known as a racehorse owner.

2500|$|Born in Kensington, London as Herbert Draper Beerbohm, Tree was {{the second}} son and second child of Julius Ewald Edward Beerbohm (1810–1892) and his wife Constantia (née Draper) Beerbohm. The senior Beerbohm was of Dutch, Lithuanian, and German origin; {{he had come to}} England in about 1830 and set up as a prosperous <b>corn</b> <b>merchant.</b> Draper was an Englishwoman. They had four children. Tree's younger brother was the author and {{explorer}} Julius Beerbohm, and his sister was author Constance Beerbohm. A younger half-brother was the parodist and caricaturist Max Beerbohm, born from their father's second marriage. Max jokingly claimed that Herbert added the [...] "Tree" [...] to his name because it was easier for audiences than shouting [...] "Beerbohm! Beerbohm!" [...] at curtain calls. The latter part of his surname, [...] "bohm", is north German dialect for [...] "tree".|$|E
50|$|The {{firm was}} started in 1890 by Henry Sturgess Pledge. He was apprenticed at the Black Mill, Barham c.1850. Upon leaving Barham some time before 1882, Pledge ran the Wind, Steam and Water Mills at Kennington until 1892. Pledge ran the company with his sons Lawrence John Pledge and Walter Ebeneser Pledge. H S Pledge & Sons Ltd were millers and <b>corn</b> <b>merchants</b> owning two mills in Ashford; Victoria Mills and East Hill Mill.|$|R
5000|$|Victoria Mill was {{powered by}} steam at first, but a {{generator}} {{was used to}} produce electricity from 1926.

They often won awards for their flours.Pledges owned a very successful Seed and <b>Corn</b> <b>Merchants</b> business in Ashford High street called Worger & Co.Ltd which had been in existence since 1830.|$|R
50|$|He {{was educated}} at Balham Grammar School in London, Sir John Leman High School in Beccles, Suffolk and Norwich High School for Boys, {{where it is}} said that his {{initials}} can still be seen carved into the brickwork {{on the side of the}} building in Upper St. Giles Street. Upon leaving school he worked as a clerk at a <b>corn</b> <b>merchants</b> in Ipswich before finding employment in London as a commercial traveller for the Sanitas Disinfectant Company.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Axworthy, {{though the}} mill was {{the centre of}} his business, {{was in fact a}} <b>corn</b> <b>merchant</b> of {{considerable}} wealth, and with opportunities of extending his connection much farther. Had his personal character been otherwise, Dr. May thought a young man could not have a better opening than a seat in his office, and the future power of taking shares in his trade; there need be no loss of position, and there was great likelihood both of prosperity and the means of extensive usefulness.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Hilbery {{shook his}} head. [...] "I should be {{inclined}} to doubt whether they were altogether in that walk of life," [...] he observed. [...] "I fancy that Denham {{once told me that}} his father was a <b>corn</b> <b>merchant.</b> Perhaps he said a stockbroker. He came to grief, anyhow, as stockbrokers have a way of doing. I've a great respect for Denham," [...] he added. The remark sounded to his ears unfortunately conclusive, and he was afraid that there was nothing more to be said about Denham. He examined {{the tips of his fingers}} carefully. [...] "Cassandra's grown into a very charming young woman," [...] he started afresh. [...] "Charming to look at, and charming to talk to, though her historical knowledge is not altogether profound. Another cup of tea?" ...|$|E
60|$|A thing Graham {{had already}} learnt, {{and which he}} found very hard to imagine, was that nearly all the towns in the country, and almost all the villages, had disappeared. Here and there only, he understood, some {{gigantic}} hotel-like edifice stood amid square miles of some single cultivation and preserved {{the name of a}} town--as Bournemouth, Wareham, or Swanage. Yet the officer had speedily convinced him how inevitable such a change had been. The old order had dotted the country with farmhouses, and every two or three miles was the ruling landlord's estate, and the place of the inn and cobbler, the grocer's shop and church--the village. Every eight miles or so was the country town, where lawyer, <b>corn</b> <b>merchant,</b> wool-stapler, saddler, veterinary surgeon, doctor, draper, milliner and so forth lived. Every eight miles--simply because that eight mile marketing journey, four there and back, was as much as was comfortable for the farmer. But directly the railways came into play, and after them the light railways, and all the swift new motor cars that had replaced waggons and horses, and so soon as the high roads began to be made of wood, and rubber, and Eadhamite, and all sorts of elastic durable substances--the necessity of having such frequent market towns disappeared. And the big towns grew. They drew the worker with the gravitational force of seemingly endless work, the employer with their suggestion of an infinite ocean of labour.|$|E
50|$|Mackie {{was the son}} of Robert J Mackie of St John's Wakefield. He {{was educated}} at Wesley College, Sheffield and became a partner in the firm of Robert Mackie and Sons, <b>corn</b> <b>merchants.</b> He was a J.P. for the West Riding of Yorkshire. His brother was John Mackie, J.P. (1836-1891), benefactor of the Crigglestone area, whose wife {{dedicated}} the Church of St John the Divine, Calder Grove in his honour. R.B. Mackie married Fanny Shaw daughter of William Shaw of Stanley Hall, Wakefield in 1852.|$|R
5000|$|Suttons Seeds {{were founded}} in the Berkshire town of Reading in 1806 by John Sutton (1777-1863). Originally the company traded as <b>corn</b> <b>merchants</b> and were known as the 'House of Sutton'. In 1832 John Sutton was joined in the {{business}} by his sons, Martin Hope (1815-1901) and Alfred (d. 1897). In 1837 the business moved to Reading's Market Place, where the sons persuaded their father to expand into the flower and vegetable seed trade. From this time on the firm progressed and expanded rapidly, earning a reputation for supplying pure, unadulterated seed.|$|R

60|$|And now {{the time}} was coming when {{it was to be}} decided whether, by a last bold stroke, the credit of the House of Girdlestone was to be saved, or whether the attempt was to plunge them into deeper and more hopeless ruin. An unscrupulous agent named Langworthy had, as already indicated, been {{despatched}} to Russia well primed with instructions as to what to do and how to do it. He had been in the employ of an English <b>corn</b> <b>merchant</b> at Odessa, and had some knowledge of the Russian language which would be invaluable to him in his undertaking. In the character of an English gentleman of scientific tastes he was to establish himself in some convenient village among the Ural Mountains. There he was to remain some little time, so as to arouse confidence in the people before making his pretended discovery. He was then to carry his rough diamonds to Tobolsk, as the nearest large town, and to exhibit them there, backing up his assertion by the evidence of villagers who had seen him dig them up. The Girdlestones knew that that alone would be sufficient when telegraphed to England to produce a panic in the sensitive diamond market. Before any systematic inquiry could be made, Langworthy would have disappeared, and their little speculation would have come off. After that the sooner the people realized that it was a hoax the better for the conspirators. In any case, {{there seemed to be no}} possibility that the origin of the rumour could be traced. Meanwhile, Ezra Girdlestone had secured his passage in the Cape mail steamer Cyprian. On the night that he left he sat up late in the library at Eccleston Square talking over the matter for the last time with his father.|$|E
