40|$|Health {{problems}} caused by indoor fungi have become an important issue {{in recent years and}} carpets are known to be suitable substrates for fungal growth. The purpose of this research was to identify some natural products of relatively low human toxicity that can act as substitutes for potentially hazardous antifungal agents currently applied to carpets, and to investigate the efficacy of ethylcellulose as an extender of these unstable products in carpets. Tea tree oil, garlic oil, benzoate, sorbate, propionate, thymol, star-anise, eugenol, and cinnamaldehyde were each introduced into Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) plates inoculated with Aspergillus versicolor or Penicillium chrysogenum. The plates were then incubated at 25 °C, and the zones of inhibition were measured. Of nine agents tested, thymol, benzoate, and sorbate were chosen for their higher inhibitory effects. Next, solutions of thymol, benzoate, and sorbate, individually and in various combinations were applied to <b>carpet</b> <b>square</b> samples, which were then inoculated with A. versicolor and P. chrysogenum and incubated at 25 °C with 97 % relative humidity (RH). Spore counting was conducted, and carpet treated with the mixture of thymol (3. 3 μg/mm 2), benzoate (16. 5 μg/mm 2), and sorbate (16. 5 μg/mm 2) (TBS-carpet) showed inhibitory effects at the low concentrations tested. Ethylcellulose was then added to the TBS mixture as a coating polymer (TBSC-carpet). TBSC- and TBS-carpet were compared and results indicated that the addition of the cellulose maintained the antifungal properties of TBS even in carpet samples stored for up to 12 months. These comparison tests were repeated under extreme conditions of high humidity (99 %RH for 168 hours) or immersion in water (for 24 hours followed by a 10 minute rinse). HPLC determination for the amounts of remaining thymol, benzoate, and sorbate in carpets indicated that all were greater in the TBSC-carpet than in the TBS-carpet. Spore counting also was performed. However, spore counting indicated TBS-carpet still had inhibitory effects that were only slightly less than TBSC-carpet. ...|$|E
40|$|Dogs {{have the}} ability to {{determine}} the direction of an odour trail left by a human. This study examined how much olfactory information from this trail is required by dogs to determine direction. Six dogs, able to determine direction, were tested on a 21 footstep trail laid on 21 individual <b>carpet</b> <b>squares,</b> one footstep per square, by the same individual wearing the same shoes. Dogs brought in at right-angles to the trail at its centre were able to correctly determine direction better than chance (P < 0. 025). Dogs were unable to determine direction when the order of the footsteps was randomized by rearranging the order of the <b>carpet</b> <b>squares.</b> When the individual odour cue was removed, but ground disturbance left, dogs were unable to determine direction, indicating that it was the odour of the individual that was used to determine direction. In the final experiment the number of footsteps made available to the dog was reduced from 21 to 11 and then 9, 7, 5 and finally 3. Dogs were able to determine direction from 5 footsteps but not 3. It was calculated that it takes; 1 – 2 s for the odour information in footsteps to change to provide discernible information that can be used by dogs to determine direction. The process by which dogs may determine direction from odour cues is discussed...|$|R

50|$|The game {{is played}} on a game grid of 7 times 7 squares. Players place “carpets” {{of the size of}} two squares, {{possibly}} overlapping each other. Each player has a color and plays only carpets of his color from his stack. The players also move a single “trader” piece on the grid using a special six-sided dice. When someone moves the trader to an opponent's carpet, they have to pay an amount of game money equal to the size of connected <b>carpet</b> <b>squares</b> of the same colour to the owner of the carpet.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cadaver {{dogs are}} known as {{valuable}} forensic tools in crime scene investigations. Scientific research attempting to verify their value is largely lacking, specifically for scents associated with the early postmortem interval. The aim of our investigation was the comparative evaluation of the reliability, accuracy, and specificity of three cadaver dogs belonging to the Hamburg State Police in the detection of scents during the early postmortem interval. MATERIAL AND METHODS: <b>Carpet</b> <b>squares</b> were used as an odor transporting media after they had been contaminated {{with the scent of}} two recently deceased bodies (PMI< 3 h). The contamination occurred for 2 min as well as 10 min without any direct contact between the carpet and the corpse. Comparative searches by the dogs were performed over a time period of 65 days (10 min contamination) and 35 days (2 min contamination). RESULTS: The results {{of this study indicate that}} the well-trained cadaver dog is an outstanding tool for crime scene investigation displaying excellent sensitivity (75 - 100), specificity (91 - 100), and having a positive predictive value (90 - 100), negative predictive value (90 - 100) as well as accuracy (92 - 100) ...|$|R

5000|$|Fights {{are played}} on a <b>square</b> <b>carpet</b> that is no smaller than 14×14 meters. Fights occur on the square with {{the border of the}} fight zone at 8×8 m or 10×10 m. The [...] "external zone" [...] of the carpet serves for the safety of sportsmen and is no less than 3 meters in size. On a {{knockout}} of a fighter the carpet fight stops and a command [...] "Stop" [...] is issued. The judge will then issue a [...] "Fighters to the middle" [...] command, which directs sportsmen to go to the center (middle) of the carpet. Thus, if a knockout of one or more fighters has happened on the carpet (including on the safety zone), and the combat's termination has occurred outside of the fighting square, such reception is estimated, and the combat stops by the general rules.|$|R
2500|$|The Edward V. Babcock Memorial Room is a plush, carpeted, wood-paneled {{conference room}} {{constructed}} on the 40th floor {{for use as}} the University trustees' boardroom. Funded by a Babcock family grant of $327,000 ($ in [...] dollars) and dedicated in November 1958, all of the room’s features are original, except for the lighting, furniture and <b>carpeting.</b> The room's <b>square</b> shape is modified by four alcoves, in {{one of which is}} a portrait of Babcock by Malcolm Stevens Parcell. The walls, featuring intricate geometric patterns, are paneled in Appalachian white oak with burled walnut inlays and touches of rosewood. The windows, adorned by leaf-patterned curtains, boast a spectacular panoramic view of the surrounding area. The room is also adjoined by a kitchen. Access to the room is limited to a spiral staircase and an elevator, both requiring a key, that originate on the 36th floor. During the early 1970s at the height of student activism, a group of protesting students attempted to barricade the room during a trustees meeting. [...] Today, the trustees have outgrown the room and generally meet in the Assembly Room of the William Pitt Union. [...] The Babcock room now serves as a seminar and meeting room and is also used for special events. A pair of peregrine falcons nests on the balcony outside the room.|$|R
50|$|The San Marco Altarpiece {{depicts a}} {{portrait}} of the Virgin and Child seated on a throne surrounded by saints and angels. The formal elements are innovative for a contemporary Virgin and Child altarpiece as the positioning of the characters creates a deeply receding and logical space in front of the landscape background. The pomegranate embroidered curtain behind the Virgin and Child establishes a distinct horizontal line separating the events depicted in the painting from the landscape behind it. The altarpiece is situated on the then newly invented single rectangular panel, which helps turn a typical easel painting into the principal image of the altarpiece. Representing the figures set within a coherent pictorial space was also a new technique Angelico employed. While partially covered by the saints and angels, there is a definite line created by the <b>carpet's</b> receding <b>squares</b> in the foreground adding depth to the painting. Angelico's use of space is exceptional as he creates a sense of balance {{on both sides of the}} Virgin and Child, but also leaves available space on the carpet approaching the Virgin and Child so the viewer does not feel blocked or overwhelmed. This symmetry and order would allow worshippers to clearly view the painting from afar. He also employs naturalistic effects of light and color combined with a variety of colors and patterns. The natural colors contribute to the slightly darker complexion of the painting, which may accentuate the sacred holiness of the moment. His usage of the red and blue traditional colors of the Virgin and Saints Cosmas and Damian are noteworthy. By dressing both kneeling saints as well as several of the angels in red, Angelico creates a vertical link and further geometric stability. The symmetry resulting from the figures and colors allows the viewer to zoom-in and creates a smooth, continuous movement from figure to figure, eventually arriving at the Virgin and Child in the center. On the right, Saint Damian kneels on an inward angle towards the center praising the Virgin and Child, which draws the viewer's eyes towards the painting's vanishing point at the Virgin's chin. The Virgin and Child are featured precisely at the vertical and horizontal axes' intersecting points and are placed above Angelico's Trompe l'oeil depiction of the crucifixion. One may criticize Angelico for his imperfect use of scale. Though they are sitting on a pedestal, the Virgin and Child do not seem much larger than the rest of the characters, showing a lack of a scale setting the main subjects apart from other mortals. If anything, the Virgin and Child should be smaller due to their increased distance from the viewer. While he does create a sense of depth, the distance to approach the throne is minimal, which some historians perceive as a lack of awe for the holy figures. The altarpiece is thus seen as a radical departure from the vulnerable models known in Dominican art. One should also note that the San Marco Altarpiece is one of the earliest examples of sacra conversazione (sacred conversation), a type of image showing the Virgin and Child amongst saints in a unified space and single pictorial field, rather than setting them completely apart.|$|R
