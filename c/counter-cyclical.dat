5|$|At {{the height}} of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes {{published}} The Means to Prosperity, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly <b>counter-cyclical</b> public spending. The Means to Prosperity contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect. While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other world leaders. The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to Robert Skidelsky, helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 London Economic Conference opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.|$|E

25|$|The Fraser Government with Howard as Treasurer {{lost the}} 1983 {{election}} to the Labor Party led by Bob Hawke. Over {{the course of the}} 1980s, the Liberal party came to accept the free-market policies that Fraser had resisted and Howard had espoused. Policies included low protection, decentralisation of wage fixation, financial deregulation, a broadly based indirect tax, and the rejection of <b>counter-cyclical</b> fiscal policy.|$|E
25|$|Wheat {{farmers are}} a major {{beneficiary}} of crop subsidies and other agricultural programs. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture data, from 1995 to 2012 the U.S. federal government paid over $39 billion in wheat subsidies, through direct payments (2003–present) and production flexibility contracts (1996-2002), deficiency payments, crop insurance premium subsidies, price support payments (including loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, and certificates), <b>counter-cyclical</b> programs, market loss assistance, and other wheat programs. In 2012, wheat was the third most-subsidized crop, after corn and soybeans. Wheat farmers received $1.1 billion in subsidies in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Keynesian-like {{policies}} were adopted by Sweden and Germany, but Sweden {{was seen as}} too small to command much attention, and Keynes was deliberately silent about the [...] as he was dismayed by their imperialist ambitions and their treatment of Jews. Apart from Great Britain, Keynes's attention was primarily focused on the United States. In 1931, he received considerable support for his views on <b>counter-cyclical</b> public spending in Chicago, then America's foremost centre for economic views alternative to the mainstream. However, orthodox economic opinion remained generally hostile regarding fiscal intervention to mitigate the depression, until just before the outbreak of war. In late 1933 Keynes was persuaded by Felix Frankfurter to address President Roosevelt directly, which he did by letters and face to face in 1934, after which the two men spoke highly of each other. However, according to Skidelsky, {{the consensus is that}} Keynes's efforts only began to have a more than marginal influence on US economic policy after 1939.|$|E
2500|$|The USDA's Economic Research Service explains: [...] "SNAP is a <b>counter-cyclical</b> {{government}} assistance program—it provides assistance to more low-income households during {{an economic downturn}} or recession and to fewer households during an economic expansion. The rise in SNAP participation during an economic downturn results in greater SNAP expenditures which, in turn, stimulate the economy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keynesian {{economics}} followed on {{from the}} Keynesian Revolution. In contrast to the recent resurgence of Keynesian policy making, the revolution initially comprised a shift change in theory. There had been several experiments in policy making {{that can be seen}} as precursors for Keynes' ideas, most notably President Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous [...] "New Deal" [...] in the United States. These experiments had been influenced more by morals, geopolitics and political ideology than by new developments in economics, even though Keynes had found some support in the US for his ideas about <b>counter-cyclical</b> public works policy as early as 1931.|$|E
2500|$|McCulley {{also points}} out that human nature is {{inherently}} pro-cyclical, meaning, in Minsky's words, that [...] "from time to time, capitalist economies exhibit inflations and debt deflations which seem to have the potential to spin out of control. In such processes, the economic system's reactions to a movement of the economy amplify the movement – inflation feeds upon inflation and debt-deflation feeds upon debt deflation." [...] In other words, people are momentum investors by nature, not value investors. People naturally take actions that expand the high and low points of cycles. One implication for policymakers and regulators is the implementation of <b>counter-cyclical</b> policies, such as contingent capital requirements for banks that increase during boom periods and are reduced during busts.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{these claims}} are widely disputed by the {{financial}} industry, who typically regard hedge funds as [...] "small enough to fail", since most are relatively small {{in terms of the}} assets they manage and operate with low leverage, thereby limiting the potential harm to the economic system should one of them fail. [...] Formal analysis of hedge fund leverage before and during the 2008 financial crisis suggests that hedge fund leverage is both fairly modest and <b>counter-cyclical</b> to the market leverage of investment banks and the larger financial sector. Hedge fund leverage decreased prior to the financial crisis, even while the leverage of other financial intermediaries continued to increase. Hedge funds fail regularly, and numerous hedge funds failed during the financial crisis. In testimony to the House Financial Services Committee in 2009, Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve Board Chairman said he [...] "would not think that any hedge fund or private equity fund would become a systemically critical firm individually".|$|E
50|$|Farm {{owners had}} to use the same <b>counter-cyclical</b> payment yield method for all {{eligible}} commoditieson a farm. If farm owners did not choose to partially update their <b>counter-cyclical</b> paymentyields, then their established PFC payment yields are used to calculate <b>counter-cyclical</b> payments.|$|E
5000|$|Contract acreage — Base acres {{enrolled}} {{annually in}} the Direct and <b>Counter-cyclical</b> Program (DCP) authorized by the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 1101-1108) for covered commodities during crop years 2002 through 2007. Previously, the 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127) authorized 7-year production flexibility contracts, which guaranteed fixed direct payments but not <b>counter-cyclical</b> target price deficiency payments. The new law uses the term agreement rather than contract, but farmers must sign a Direct and <b>Counter-cyclical</b> Program Contract (Form CCC-509).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Counter-cyclical</b> payment (CCP) — Under the Direct and <b>Counter-cyclical</b> Program (DCP) {{created by}} the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 101-171, Sec. 1101-1108), <b>counter-cyclical</b> {{payments}} are made to participating producers when the marketing year average price received by farmers for a covered commodity {{is less than the}} target price. The total payment to a producer is the payment acres (85% of base acres) times the payment rate (target price minus average market price, except not more than the difference between the target price and the sum of the national loan rate and the direct payment rate).|$|E
50|$|The Direct and <b>Counter-cyclical</b> Payment Program (DCP) of the USDA {{provides}} {{payments to}} eligible producers on farms enrolled for the 2002 through 2007 crop years. There {{are two types}} of DCP payments - direct payments and <b>counter-cyclical</b> payments. Both are computed using the base acres and payment yields established for the farm.|$|E
50|$|The Farm Bill added <b>counter-cyclical</b> {{payments}}, {{which provide}} support {{counter to the}} cycle of market prices {{as part of a}} “safety net” in the event of low crop prices. <b>Counter-cyclical</b> payments for a commodity are only issued if the effective price for a commodity is below the target price for the commodity.|$|E
50|$|She {{has worked}} on {{practical}} policy applications of these ideas. She has advocated reform of compensatory financing at the IMF {{in the face of}} external shocks to make it larger, speedier and with less conditionality. Similarly she was an early supporter of expanding development banks - nationally, regionally and multilaterally - and their role in <b>counter-cyclical</b> lending. She has also advocated the issue of GDP-linked bonds as a <b>counter-cyclical</b> mechanism {{to reduce the risk of}} financial crises. She has long supported the idea of <b>counter-cyclical</b> regulation. These and other practical measures are aimed at reforming the financial system so that it supports stable inclusive economic growth without costly financial crises.|$|E

50|$|Contrary to some {{critical}} characterizations of it, Keynesianism does not consist solely of deficit spending. Keynesianism recommends <b>counter-cyclical</b> policies. An {{example of a}} <b>counter-cyclical</b> policy is raising taxes to cool the economy and to prevent inflation when there is abundant demand-side growth, and engaging in deficit spending on labour-intensive infrastructure projects to stimulate employment and stabilize wages during economic downturns. Classical economics, on the other hand, argues that one should cut taxes when there are budget surpluses, and cut spending - or, less likely, increase taxes - during economic downturns.|$|E
50|$|<b>Counter-cyclical</b> {{payments}} {{are not available}} for other oilseeds because the sum of their national loan rate and direct payment rate is {{equal to or greater}} than their target price.|$|E

5000|$|The 1996 {{farm bill}} (P.L. 107-171) {{eliminated}} deficiency payments and {{replaced them with}} production flexibility contract payments. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 101-171, Sec. 1104) reinstituted deficiency payments as <b>counter-cyclical</b> payments with somewhat different payment calculations.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the limits}} that was imposed under the Farm Bill's laws was that farms are not {{eligible}} if non-farm income exceeds $500,000 or if gross farm income is over $750,000 over a three-year period. Direct and <b>Counter-Cyclical</b> Program limits {{are the same as}} what they were in the 2002 Farm Bill. Payments are limited to $40,000 for Direct Payments and for <b>Counter-Cyclical</b> Payments to $65,000 per entity. Also, a limit of $65,000 per individual is placed under ACRE payments. The only real requirement for being able to receive these program payments is to be actively engaged in farming, contributing capital, land, or machinery, and providing labor/management.|$|E
50|$|Previous laws {{referred}} to these as minor oilseeds {{because of their}} comparatively small production compared to soybeans. These other oilseeds are eligible for Direct and <b>Counter-cyclical</b> Program payments and marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments (LDPs).|$|E

50|$|Extra {{long staple}} cotton is {{eligible}} for marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments (LDPs). The national loan rate for ELS cotton under the 2002 farm bill was $0.7977 per pound. ELS cotton, in contrast to upland cotton, does not qualify for direct payments or <b>counter-cyclical</b> payments.|$|E

50|$|The <b>counter-cyclical</b> {{nature of}} {{producer}} support is also harmful to developing-country producers. High-income farmers are insulated from changes in world prices, making production less responsive to swings in demand. As a result, world commodity prices are more volatile, and {{the burden of}} adjustment falls disproportionately on developing-country producers.|$|E
50|$|Feed grain is any grain {{used for}} {{livestock}} feed, including corn, grain sorghum, oats, rye, and barley. These grains and the farms producing them historically have received federal commodity program {{support in the}} United States. They qualify for marketing assistance loans, direct payments, and <b>counter-cyclical</b> payments under the 2002 farm bill.|$|E
50|$|Triple base {{is another}} name for {{what came to be}} known as normal flex acres. Production {{flexibility}} contracts under the 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127) and the Direct and <b>Counter-cyclical</b> Program (DCP) agreements under the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 101-171, Sec. 1101-1108) eliminated the linkage between direct payments and actual plantings.|$|E
50|$|Writing with José Antonio Ocampo {{since the}} late 1990s they {{expanded}} the concept of <b>counter-cyclical</b> reform of the international financial system to help stabilise capital flows and domestic private lending. The aim was to avoid frequent costly crises, facilitate macro-economic management and to achieve stable and inclusive economic growth in developing countries.|$|E
50|$|The <b>counter-cyclical</b> {{payment rate}} {{is the amount}} by which the target price of each {{commodity}} exceeds its effective price. The effective price for each commodity equals the direct payment rate plus the higher of: the national average market price received by producers during the marketing year, orthe national loan rate for the commodity.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Farm Service Agency administers Annual Crop Revenue Election (ACRE, a backronym), a {{new program}} {{authorized}} by the 2008 Farm Bill that begins in crop year 2009. Through ACRE, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers producers {{an alternative to the}} Direct and <b>Counter-Cyclical</b> Program. The ACRE alternative provides eligible producers a state-level revenue guarantee, based on the 5-year state Olympic average yield and the 2-year national average price. ACRE payments are made when both state- and farm-level triggers are met. By participating in ACRE, producers elect to forgo <b>counter-cyclical</b> payments, receive a 20-percent reduction in direct payments and a 30-percent reduction in CCC commodity loan rates. A decision to elect ACRE binds the elected land to the program through the 2012 crop year, the last crop year covered by the 2008 Farm Bill.|$|E
50|$|The 2002 {{farm bill}} (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 1301-1310) {{replaced}} the longtime (65-year) support program for peanuts with a framework identical in structure {{to the program}} for the so-called covered commodities (wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, rice, soybeans, and other oilseeds). The three components of the Peanut Price Support Program are fixed direct payments (at $36/ton), <b>counter-cyclical</b> payments (based on a target price of $495/ton), and marketing assistance loans or loan deficiency payments (LDPs) (based on a loan rate of $355/ton). The peanut poundage quota and the two-tiered pricing features of the old program were repealed. Only historic peanut producers are eligible for the Direct and <b>Counter-cyclical</b> Program (DCP). All current production is eligible for marketing assistance loans and LDPs. Previous owners of peanut quota were compensated through a buy-outprogram at a rate of 55¢/lb. ($1,100/ton) over a 5-year period.|$|E
