40|$|In {{recent years}} it has been proved that {{residential}} biomass combustion has a direct influence on ambient air quality, {{especially in the case}} of cereals. The aim of this study is the characterization of the emissions in small-scale fixed-bed pellet boiler (heat output of 25 kW) of beech and corn, and of its potential reduction to an addition of <b>calcium</b> <b>dihydroxide.</b> In the biomass combustion test 7 fuel mixtures were investigated with regard to the particulate content (PM 10), gaseous emissions and combustion chamber deposit. The corn kernels tanned with <b>calcium</b> <b>dihydroxide</b> determined a decrease in particulate emissions (54 ± 13 mg MJ−[*] 1) in comparison to corn, whereas in the combustion of corn pellet with 1...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} {{is a growing}} field. In the near future, {{it will probably be}} possible to generate a complete vital tooth from a single stem cell. Pulp revascularization is dependent on the ability of residual pulp and apical and periodontal stem cells to differentiate. These cells have the ability to generate a highly vascularized and a conjunctive rich living tissue. This one is able to colonize the available pulp space. Revascularization is a new treatment method for immature necrotic permanent teeth. Up to now, apexification procedures were applied for these teeth, using <b>calcium</b> <b>dihydroxide</b> or MTA to produce an artificial apical barrier. However, the pulp revascularization allows the stimulation of the apical development and the root maturation of immature teeth. Two pulp revascularization techniques are used in the literature, one using <b>calcium</b> <b>dihydroxide</b> and the second using a triple antibiotic paste. Based on these two different pulp revascularization protocols, which obtain the desired therapeutic success, the literature will be reviewed and analyzed according to the relevance of their choice of materials. Based on the literature, we propose a new relevant protocol and a new mixture of antibiotics...|$|E
