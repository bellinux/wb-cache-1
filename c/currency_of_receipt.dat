To be useful as a tool in acquisition and cataloging, <b>currency</b> in <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> the Current Catalog is necessary. A survey of 263 titles with 1967 imprints, which were received by the Library of the Medical Sciences, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, was made to determine {{the correlation between the}} <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> these books in the library and their appearance in the Current Catalog...|$|R
40|$|The work {{is focused}} on {{exchange}} rate risk, its description and typical situations in which firms have to face to the uncertainty caused by variability of exchange rates. It specifies selected internal (operational) techniques which are used to manage exchange rate risk as well. These methods are connected with financial management of companies {{and it is possible}} to apply these techniques to every size of company. The principle and the implementation of internal methods might be tighter to smaller companies. These companies do not know a lot about a wide scale of instruments of financial market, so hedging through external methods may not be suitable. Internal methods contrary to external are also suitable for hedging economic exposure (substantial part of the work {{is focused on}} economic exposure). In response to current events, exchange rate risk is also discussed in connection with continuing economic depression and pending fiscal situation of the countries which are part of euro area. In analytic part the work is focused on a Czech import-oriented firm which purchases machines from Taiwanese suppliers for euro and dollars and consequently sells these goods in the Czech market mostly in Czech koruna. In some cases the firm negotiates invoicing in euro. <b>Currency</b> mismatch <b>of</b> <b>receipts</b> and payments gives rise to exchange rate risk. In addition, firm's business contracts are specific to high nominal value and longer maturity. With the growth of these two parameters increases exchange rate risk...|$|R
40|$|An IMR Open Report. Revenue from mineral {{resources}} {{has contributed to}} the improvement of {{the quality of life in}} several countries globally. The importance of mining in the SADC region is demonstrated by the amount of minerals produced; 40 % of vanadium, 72 % of the platinum group of metals, 40 % of chromite, and 55 % of diamonds of the global output. Mining contributes about 60 % <b>of</b> the foreign <b>currency</b> <b>receipts</b> <b>of</b> the SADC region (www. sadc. int). Some of the major settlements providing much needed services have developed due to mining, e. g. Johannesburg, Francistown, Copperbelt towns of Zambia. Mining contributes significantly to government revenue in Southern Africa, e. g. 45 % in -Botswana in 2004. The importance of the mining sector has been recognized at the SADC level through various initiatives aimed at the development of this sector, e. g. SADC Protocol on Mining, and attempts at harmonizing policies relevant to the development of the sector (UNECA, 2004). However, in the international arena, continued exploitation of {{mineral resources}} is increasingly depended upon the demonstrated capacity of the industry to effectively deal with the vast amount of waste generated from mining through to beneficiation...|$|R
