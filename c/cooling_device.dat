50|$|The Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) of a {{particular}} <b>cooling</b> <b>device</b> is the ratio of output cooling energy (in BTU) to input electrical energy (in Wh) at a given operating point.

Thermoelectric <b>cooling</b> <b>devices</b> which {{actually}} refrigerate using the Peltier effect {{can help with}} high thermal design power (TDP) processors made by Intel and AMD in the early twenty-first century. Thermoelectric <b>cooling</b> <b>devices</b> create temperature differences between two plates by running an electric current through the plates. This method of cooling is highly effective, but itself generates significant heat elsewhere which must be carried away, often by a convection-based heatsink or a water cooling system.|$|R
30|$|It seems {{important}} for <b>cooling</b> <b>devices</b> used in construction industry not to prevent workers’ movement and to supply sufficient cooling effect. From this point, {{the property to}} be easily attachable and detachable from workers’ bodies is suitable for the industry. The existing research has been mainly concerned on the cooling effect by those devices and has not considered much on this aspect. The <b>cooling</b> <b>devices</b> with those properties should be evaluated for this purpose. This paper aims to investigate the cooling effect of two wearable <b>cooling</b> <b>devices</b> for construction industry by a thermal manikin. One device utilizes fans and the other does PCMs. The cooling effect is expressed as the increment of heat loss and {{also in terms of}} time duration because the workers usually work for several hours continuously. The cooling effect is evaluated by SET.|$|R

50|$|The EER {{is related}} to the {{coefficient}} of performance (COP) commonly used in thermodynamics, with the primary difference being that the COP of a <b>cooling</b> <b>device</b> is unit-less, because the numerator and denominator are expressed in the same units. The EER uses mixed units, so it doesn't have an immediate physical sense and is obtained by multiplying the COP(or EER) by the conversion factor from BTU/h to Watts: EER = 3.41214 × COP (see British thermal unit).|$|E
