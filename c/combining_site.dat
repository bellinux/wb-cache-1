50|$|Recombinant {{antibodies}} are monoclonal antibodies {{generated in}} vitro using synthetic genes. Recombinant antibody technology involves recovering the antibody genes {{from the source}} cells, amplifying and cloning the genes into an appropriate vector, introducing the vector into a host, and achieving expression of adequate amounts of functional antibody. Recombinant antibodies can be cloned from any species of antibody-producing animal, if the appropriate oligonucleotide primers or hybridization probes are available. The ability to manipulate the antibody genes {{makes it possible to}} generate new antibodies and antibody fragments, such as Fab fragments and scFv in vitro. This can be done {{at the level of the}} whole <b>combining</b> <b>site</b> by making new combinations of H and L chains. It can also be done by mutating individual CDRs. Display libraries, commonly expressed in phage or yeast, can be analysed to select for desirable characteristics arising from such changes in antibody sequence.|$|E
5000|$|Capra {{is widely}} {{known for his}} studies of {{monoclonal}} antibodies. His contributions to immunology {{have focused on the}} molecular features of antibody variable regions, including key discoveries related to the antibody <b>combining</b> <b>site</b> and its relationship to antibody idiotypy and the hypervariable regions of antibody molecules. He particularly studied the antibody combining sites and mutational genetics as they apply to both diseased and healthy states. Capra was an early leader in using human monoclonal antibodies from patients with lymphocytic malignancies helping to drive the field towards biopharmaceutical therapeutics, which now represents one of the largest segments of the pharmaceutical, diagnostic and research-based industries. He was also involved in the development of mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against human tissues that are widely used as diagnostic reagents. He was among those who defined the subsets of human B lymphocytes. These studies led to a redefinition of many human B cell malignancies, which became important in the treatment of many Non-Hodgkinâ€™s Lymphomas. [...] He also co-authored a series of papers which utilized human plasmablasts after immunization to define the human immune response to influenza vaccine and generated human monoclonal antibodies from the blood. These studies led to a single cell FACS-sorting based technology for the generation of monoclonal antibodies.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{antibody}} ontogeny typically improves affinity, on-rate, and thermostability, narrows polyspecificity, and rigidifies the <b>combining</b> <b>site</b> to the conformer optimal for binding from the broader ensemble {{accessible to the}} precursor. However, many broadly-neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies incorporate unusual structural elements and recognition specificities or properties that often lead to autoreactivity. The ontogeny of 4 E 10, an autoreactive antibody with unexpected <b>combining</b> <b>site</b> flexibility, was delineated through structural and biophysical comparisons of the mature antibody with multiple potential precursors. 4 E 10 gained affinity primarily by off-rate enhancement through {{a small number of}} mutations to a highly conserved recognition surface. Controverting the conventional paradigm, the <b>combining</b> <b>site</b> gained flexibility and autoreactivity during ontogeny, while losing thermostability, though polyspecificity was unaffected. Details of the recognition mechanism, including inferred global effects due to 4 E 10 binding, suggest that neutralization by 4 E 10 may involve mechanisms beyond simply binding, also requiring the ability of the antibody to induce conformationa...|$|E

The work of Kabat (1) which utilized quantitative hapten inhibition methods, indicates that human anti-dextran antibody <b>combining</b> <b>sites</b> are sufficiently large to encompass an antigenic unit the size of a hexasaccharide.

40|$|The crystal {{structures}} of a monoclinic and a triclinic {{form of the}} peanut lectin-lactose complex, grown at pH 4. 6, have been determined. They contain two and one crystallographically independent tetramers, respectively. The unusual "open" quaternary structure of the lectin, observed in the orthorhombic complex grown in neutral pH, is retained at the acidic pH. The sugar molecule is bound to three of the eight subunits in the monoclinic crystals, whereas the combining sites in four are empty. The lectin-sugar interactions are almost the same at neutral and acidic pH. A comparison of the sugar-bound and free subunits indicates that the geometry of the <b>combining</b> <b>site</b> is relatively unaffected by ligand binding. The <b>combining</b> <b>site</b> of the eighth subunit in the monoclinic crystals is bound to a peptide stretch in a loop from a neighboring molecule. The same interaction exists in two subunits of the triclinic crystals, whereas density corresponding to sugar exists in the combining sites {{of the other two}} subunits.

40|$|The crystal {{structures}} of the Fabâ€² fragment of the anti-progesterone monoclonal antibody DB 3 and its complexes with steroid haptens {{have shown that the}} D-JH junctional residue TrpH 100 is a key contributor to binding site interactions with ligands. The indole group of TrpH 100 also undergoesÂ a significant conformational change between the bound and unliganded states, effectively opening and closing the <b>combining</b> <b>site</b> pocket. In order to explore the effect of substitutions at this position on steroid recognition, we have carried out mutagenesis on a construct encoding a three-domain single-chain fragment (VH/K) of DB 3 expressed in Escherichia coli. TrpH 100 was replaced by 13 different amino acids or deleted, and the functional andÂ antigenic properties of the mutated fragments were analyzed. Most substitutions, including small, hydrophobic, hydrophilic, neutral, and negatively charged side chains, were reduced or abolished binding to free progesterone, although binding to progesterone-BSA was partially retained. The reduction in antigen binding was paralleled by alteration of the idiotype associated with the DB 3 <b>combining</b> <b>site.</b> In contrast, the replacement of TrpH 100 by Arg produced a mutant that retained wild-type antibody affinity and idiotype, but with altered specificity. Significant changes in this mutant included increased relative affinities of 104 -fold for progesterone- 3 -carboxymethyloxime and 10 -fold for aetiocholanolone. Our results demonstrate an essential role for the junctional residue H 100 in determining steroid-binding specificity and <b>combining</b> <b>site</b> idiotype and show that these properties can be changed by a single amino acid substitution at this position...|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{modeling}} {{studies on}} antibody Fv regions have been pursued {{to design a}} second antigen-binding site (chi-site) in a chimeric single-chain Fv (chi sFv) species of about 30 kDa. This analysis has uncovered an architectural basis common to many Fv regions that permits grafting a chi-site onto the Fv surface that diametrically opposes the normal <b>combining</b> <b>site.</b> By using molecular graphics analysis, chimeric complementarity-determining regions (chi CDRs) were defined that comprised most of the CDRs from an antibody binding site of interest. The chain directionality of chi CDRs was consistent with that of specific bottom loops of the sFv, which allowed for grafting of chi CDRs with an overall geometry approximating CDRs in the parent <b>combining</b> <b>site.</b> Analysis of 10 different Fv crystal structures indicates that the positions for inserting chi CDRs are very highly conserved, as are the corresponding chi CDR boundaries in the parent binding site.

The Dnp-binding subsite in the modified structure is composed of the side chains of three aromatic amino acids Trp 93 L, Tyr 3 4 L and 3 4 H. A fourth aromatic amino acid residue is close to the side chain-NH-CH 2 -group, this is Tyr 33 H - The antibody-hapten binding is a simple encounter process, which causes no extensive conformation change in the Fv fragment. A method for paramagnetic structural studies has been devised using Dnp derivatives with cllgophosphate side chains, which create a specific manganese binding site on the Fv fragment-hapten complex. The distances from the bound metal ion to the imidazole side chains of two of the three hlstldine residues of protein 315 have been determined.
