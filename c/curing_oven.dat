50|$|In certain applications, a {{low-pressure}} steam autoclave can replace an ordinary <b>curing</b> <b>oven.</b> The combination of vacuum consolidation, which {{is equivalent to}} approximately ten to fourteen psi external pressure, and steam {{at about the same}} gauge pressure, will give better results and faster heat-up than the oven would. This approach would be less suitable for materials that have to be brought to curing temperature slowly, since steam transfers its heat fairly quickly compared to even a turbulent circulating air flow. Furthermore, since the interior of the vessel is repeatedly exposed to steam and then air, over and over again, an allowance must be made for corrosion of the vessel walls.|$|E
50|$|When a {{thermoset}} powder {{is exposed}} to elevated temperature, it begins to melt, flows out, and then chemically reacts to form a higher molecular weight polymer in a network-like structure. This cure process, called crosslinking, requires a certain temperature for a certain length of {{time in order to}} reach full cure and establish the full film properties for which the material was designed. Normally the powders cure at 200 °C (390 °F) for 10 minutes. The curing schedule could vary according to the manufacturer's specifications. The application of energy to the product to be cured can be accomplished by convection <b>cure</b> <b>ovens,</b> infrared <b>cure</b> <b>ovens,</b> or by laser curing process.

50|$|Durcon Epoxy Resin worksurfaces are {{thermosets}} cured {{through three}} stages. By combining two reactive materials - monolithic epoxy resin and the curing agent - with a catalyst and heat, the resin and curing agent react {{to result in}} the branching of chains. As curing continues, molecular weight accelerates causing viscosity to increase. Eventually, the material changes from a viscous liquid to a solid gel. The material is then placed into a <b>curing</b> <b>oven</b> to increase durability and solidity. The final stage of curing results in completion of the cross-linking process at which the average molecule weight diverges to infinity. Thermosets like epoxy resin possess good dimensional stability, thermal stability and chemical resistance.|$|E
50|$|The {{first stage}} in the {{manufacturing}} of aluminium boats was to cut out the hull skins and the other sheet metal parts such as the seats using templates under a radial arm router. Sections were then formed by a brake press and swaging, to form the gunwales and hull folds. Stiffening of sheet metal panels was {{by means of a}} 3,000 ton rubber press. Extruded gunwale, keel and strake sections of the hull were initially formed in a half-hard condition for ease of working and drop hammering, later being placed in a <b>curing</b> <b>oven</b> to bring them to full-hard condition. The skin sections were welded on wooden jigs on which the seats, gunwales, decks and extruded sections were positioned and riveted into position. The boat was then tested in a pressure tank to reveal any water leaks. The finished craft was then painted in a temperature-controlled paint shop. de Havilland also produced the polyurethane flotation material used in the boats which shaped and fitted into position. The company was noted for its use of rivets to join sections of the craft, together with the more common use of welding. In its advertisements, de Havilland Marine referred to this riveting process by the Sealomatic name.|$|E

Despite heating applications being common throughout industry, there is currently no framework that provides practical guidance for energy optimisation in ovens. This paper presents a systematic approach to guide an engineer through five stages of optimisation. It begins with defining the problem and system boundaries, before developing a thorough understanding of the oven system through mass balance and energy analysis as well as identifying all process variables. Analysis of key process variables is conducted to develop process & product understanding and to identify key variables. Improvement of the system and then controlling for full implementation leads to successful conclusion of the project. Application of this methodology has been conducted on <b>curing</b> <b>oven</b> for masking tape manufacture. The optimisation results in a potential 4. 7 % annual reduction of the plants energy consumption and off-setting 305 teCO 2 from minimal capital expenditure.

40|$|Case-based {{reasoning}} (CBR) is a reasoning paradigm {{that starts}} the reasoning process by examining past similar experiences. The motivation behind this thesis {{lies in the}} observation that causal knowledge can guide case-based reasoning in dealing with large and complex systems as it guides humans. In this thesis, case-bases used for reasoning about processes where each case consists of a temporal sequence are considered. In general, these temporal sequences include persistent and transitory (non-persistent) attributes. As these sequences tend to be long, {{it is unlikely to}} find a single case in the case-base that closely matches the problem case. By utilizing causal knowledge {{in the form of a}} dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) and exploiting the independence implied by the structure of the network and known attributes, this system matches independent portions of the problem case to corresponding sub-cases from the case-base. However, the matching of sub-cases has to take into account the persistence properties of attributes. The approach is then applied to a real life temporal process situation involving an automotive <b>curing</b> <b>oven,</b> in which a vehicle moves through stages within the oven to satisfy some thermodynamic relationships and requirements that change from stage to stage.

Impact damages on the {{composites}} need to be understood thoroughly for the designing, manufacturing and repairing of the aircraft composite parts.

Larger impact dents can be easily detected during the regular visual inspection, while the smaller dents with significant internal damages cannot be detected which may compromise the structure resulting in safety concerns for the composite aircraft. 3 D characterization of impact damages on glass, carbon, and Kevlar fibers reinforced composite structures may be necessary to better understand the material behavior and provide better designs.

Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) is performed to determine the region of glass-rubber transition temperature (Tg). Further parameters {{were obtained from the}} description of the loss factor curves (tanδ) with models based on exponentially modified Gauss (EMG) distribution function. Polyurethane binders employing the polyol HTPB and diisocyanate were filled with 20, 40, and 60 mass-% of ammonium perchlorate (AP), aluminum (Al) or cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) particles, using fine and coarse mean sizes. A special turning device manufactured by Fraunhofer ICT was installed inside the <b>curing</b> <b>oven</b> in order to avoid sedimentation during curing. The cured composites were characterized by DMA in torsion mode from - 100 °C to 70 °C. The good homogeneous distribution of fillers in the samples was evaluated by computational X-ray micro-tomography. The data on tanδ showed a complex structure describable at first with 2 overlapping peaks. The peak at lower temperatures is due to mobility of unrestricted binder parts (Tgunr) and the second broader peak at high temperature is due to mobility of restricted binder parts (Tgres). Results of tanδ, calculated areas of EMG curves and apparent activation energies of the distinct relaxation processes indicate that Al particles have higher interaction with HTPB-based polyurethane than AP and RDX. Probably Al is bonded to the binder network via isocyanate coupling with OH groups present in the surface. Ammonium perchlorate and cyclotrimethylene trinitramine particle sizes and its morphology influenced the viscoelastic properties.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the design of}} a computer controlled pilot production plant capable of manufacturing hybrid braided/pultruded rod on a continuous basis. The current product design utilizes a high modulus carbon fiber core with a braided over-wrap composed of various materials. Production is accomplished in three phases: core fiber sorting and impregnation, 2 D braiding, and resin curing. On-line impregnation of the core strands is accomplished using a pressure-fed impregnation ring. Deposition of the 2 D braid is performed by a Maypole braider. Curing of the resin is accomplished using a novel two phase method. An induction heater first increases the temperature of steel wires embedded in the rod core. Next three tunnel ovens provide heat flux to the exterior of the rod. A caterpillar-type puller is used to advance the rod through the process. Prior to this work production was accomplished by manually adjusting machinery operating parameters through controls distributed throughout the production facility. This led to inconsistent quality product. The modifications to production equipment and the development of an automation system which allow one to improve. The modifications to production equipment and the development of an automation system which allow to improve product quality are the main topics of this work.

40|$|In {{line with}} the growing concern about the {{environmental}} impact of materials in the building sector, Knauf Insulation, a glass wool producer, is performing environmental impact assessment of its products through LCA. Knauf Insulation has several glass wool factories in Europe that produce various products, and for a specific market, the same product can be produced in several factories. As the plants that produce glass wool work with similar pathways, a generic model for LCA usable for every plant and every glass wool product has been designed. Moreover, combination of different factories is also possible. The general principle of glass wool production is the following: the raw materials, sand, limestone, soda ash, borax, sodium carbonate, as well as recycled off-cuts from the production process, are weighed and mixed. Knauf Insulation also uses a large amount of recycled glass (cullet). The mix is sent to a furnace at high temperature (1350 °C). The melted material is then fiberized and the binder is added, a process called forming. Knauf Insulation uses a special binder with ECOSE Technology, a new and formaldehyde-free binder. The wool fibers are collected, by suction, on a conveyor belt, and the mattress then goes through the <b>curing</b> <b>oven.</b> For some product a facing is added. Finally the product is compressed and packed. The model, implemented in GaBi 6, is made as generic as possible by including, for each step, all the raw materials {{that can be used in}} one of the factories as well as all the energy sources. Parameters allow to define the amount of each raw material consumed, therefore the model can be adapted to any factory simply by setting these parameters accordingly. This also simplifies the data collection, since the template is the same for all the factories, it can be supported by data collection tools already existing. A part of the model is dedicated to weighting between factories, so a combination of factories can also be studied. The model can also be adapted to almost all Knauf Insulation products by using parameters where necessary: for example, several products have different binder contents, so a parameter defines the amount of binder. As some materials can be recycled between several parts of the process, special attention has been paid to recycling loops inside the model. The model is flexible enough to be used for Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) as well as for Eco-Design purposes. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Recently, it {{was found}} that the second peak of the loss factor curve {{determined}} by DMA of HTPB bonded composite propellants and high explosives can change significantly in intensity and shape with composition. Composite propellants with AP connected via bonding agents to the binder matrix can show a pronounced second peak, whereas HMX and RDX produce a weaker peak and with high content, it can show only as shoulder attached to the first peak at lower temperatures. The second peak is also much more sensitive to ageing and to de-wetting. This means interaction between filler and matrix influence the appearance of the peak. Therefore, a more detailed investigation was started to elucidate the influences of fillers on the loss factor curve. Polyurethane binders made from polyol HTPB and isocyanate IPDI were filled with 20, 40 and 60 mass-% of ammonium perchlorate (AP), aluminum (Al) or RDX, using fine and coarse particles. For obtaining the cured elastomer, a special turning device constructed and manufactured at Fraunhofer ICT was installed inside the <b>curing</b> <b>oven</b> in order to avoid sedimentation of the fillers during curing. The cured composites were characterized by DMA in torsion mode from - 100 °C to + 70 °C, and the quality of distribution of fillers was evaluated by X-ray micro-tomography, which showed homogenous distribution of the filler particles in the samples. The part of loss factor tanδ at lower temperatures originates from the glass-rubber transition of the binder parts, which are unrestricted in mobility, defined so as comparison for the second broader peak at the high temperature side, which is caused by binder parts restricted in mobility. The temperatures at each maximum are called Tgunr and Tgres, respectively. The results are: AP and RDX cause more changes in intensity of the first main peak in tanδ than Al particles. The maximum temperature Tgunr is nearly not changed by any of the fillers. The changes in tanδ intensity determined from baseline corrected loss factor curves and modelled by EMG (exponentially modified Gauss) distributions indicate that Al has a stronger interaction with HTPB binder than AP and RDX particles. The particle sizes of AP and RDX and their shapes effect the viscoelastic properties. Increasing content of AP and RDX increase the storage modulus G’ and somewhat the loss modulus G’’, but as a whole tanδ intensity is lowered in the main peak...|$|E
