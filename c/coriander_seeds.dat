25|$|Indian Chinese cuisine, {{also known}} as Indo-Chinese cuisine {{originated}} in the 19th century among the Chinese community of Calcutta, during the immigration of Hakka Chinese from Canton (present-day Guangzhou) seeking to escape the First and Second Opium Wars and political instability in the region. Upon exposure to local Indian cuisine, they incorporated many spices and cooking techniques into their own cuisine, thus creating a unique fusion of Indian and Chinese cuisine. After 1947, many Cantonese immigrants fleeing political repression under Mao Zedong, opened their own restaurants in Calcutta, whose dishes combined aspects of Indian cuisine with Cantonese cuisine. While Indian Chinese cuisine is heavily derived from traditional Chinese cuisine, it bears little resemblance to its Chinese counterpart. The dishes tend to be flavoured with cumin, <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds,</b> and turmeric, which with a few regional exceptions, are not traditionally associated with Chinese cuisine. Chilli, ginger, garlic and yogurt are also frequently used in dishes.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of aerobic training with <b>coriander</b> <b>seed</b> extract on apoA- 1, Lipid Profile and Insulin Resistance in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Methods: 40 diabetic male Wistar rats with the average age of 12 weeks and weight 130 ± 10 g were randomly divided into four groups: control, extract, training and training-extract. Diabetes was induced in rats with a single injection of streptozotocin-induced in a dose of 60 mg/kg of body weight. High glucose levels in 250 mg/dl defined as diabetic criteria. Extract administered orally 150 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. The program training was included six weeks of aerobic exercise, 5 times a week with 50 to 55 percent of maximal oxygen consumption. Data were analyzed with using of one-way ANOVA and Tukey test at α< 0. 05. Results: The results showed that aerobic training with <b>coriander</b> <b>seed</b> extract significantly affect serum apoA- 1 (p= 0. 000) and glucose (p= 0. 002). However, it had no significant effect on insulin (p= 0. 656) and HOMA-IR (p= 0. 458). Also, aerobic training followed by <b>coriander</b> <b>seed</b> extract had a significant effect on triglyceride (p= 0. 007), total cholesterol (p= 0. 029), LDL (p= 0. 012) and HDL (p= 0. 000). Conclusion: It seems that regular aerobic exercise and <b>coriander</b> <b>seed</b> extract had beneficial effects on markers of cardiovascular risk in Diabetes and it can probably control some factors related to cardiovascular diseases. ...|$|R
