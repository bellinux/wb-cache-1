The throat-to-base <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> has been varied from 0. 320 to 0. 550; the jet-to-base <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> has been varied from 0. 320 to 1, resulting in a jet Mach number variation of 1. 0 to 3. 897. The jet total-pressure ratio ranged from 2 to approximately 22. The results indicated that a proper balance between nozzle over-expansion and base area exists, which will produce the maximum afterbody net-thrust factor over a given operating range. For a given Mach number and throat-to-base <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio,</b> the optimum values of jet-to-base <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> corresponding to the peak values of the net-thrust factor are, in general, larger than the values at the jet design pressure ratio and tend to increase with increasing j e t total-pressure ratio {{in a manner similar to}} the design values.

In the study, only 16. 55 % (24 / 145) of patients had liver cirrhosis due to alcohol. In the UK, alcohol is the commonest cause of liver cirrhosis. We retrospectively studied endoscopy, hae-matology, and radiology reports of 40 patients who had been treated for alcohol induced cirr-hosis at Homerton Hospital, London. Of these, 30 had oesophageal varices at endoscopy and 10 did not. The platelet count/spleen <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> was calculated within two months of endoscopy. The median platelet count/spleen <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> in patients with varices was 537 (range 371 – 670) and with no varices 2229 (range 1542 – 3174).

In this multicenter, international study, {{our aim was to}} prospectively validate the use of the platelet count/spleen <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> for the noninvasive diagnosis of EV. METHODS: A total of 218 cirrhotic patients underwent screening endoscopy for EV. Platelet count/spleen <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> ((N/mm 3) /mm) was assessed in all patients and its diagnostic accuracy was calculated. On the basis of previous results, a platelet count/spleen <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> cutoff of 909 was applied to this population. The diagnostic accuracy of the platelet count/spleen <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> was further evaluated for both severity and etiology of disease subgroups. RESULTS: Prevalence of EV was 54. 1 %. The platelet count/spleen <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> had 86. 0 % (95 % CI, 80. 7 - 90. 4 %) diagnostic accuracy for EV, which was significantly greater as compared with either accuracy of platelet count alone (83. 6 %, 95 % CI 78. 0 - 88. 3 %, P= 0. 038) or spleen diameter alone (80. 2 %, 95 % CI 74. 3 - 85. 3 %, P= 0. 018). The 909 cutoff had 91. 5 % sensitivity (95 % CI 85. 0 - 95. 9 %), 67. 0 % specificity (95 % CI 56. 9 - 76. 1 %), 76. 6 % positive predictive value, 87. 0 % negative predictive value, 2. 77 positive likelihood ratio, and 0. 13 negative likelihood ratio for the diagnosis of EV.

A logistic regression analysis was done between these parameters and mortality. ReproducibUity was calculated using Bland andAltman analysis.

Each frequency corresponded to a different length to <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> of the pulse of air leaving the driver shroud. Two of the frequencies had length to <b>diameter</b> <b>ratios</b> below the formation number, and two above.

40|$|Most of the {{industrial}} steel chimneys are tall structures with circular cross-sections. Such slender, lightly damped structures are prone to wind-exited vibration. Geometry of a self supporting steel chimney {{plays an important role}} in its structural behaviour under lateral dynamic loading. This is because geometry is primarily responsible for the stiffness parameters of the chimney. However, basic dimensions of industrial self supporting steel chimney, such as height, diameter at exit, etc., are generally derived from the associated environmental conditions. To ensure a desired failure mode design code (IS- 6533 : 1989 Part 2) imposes several criteria on the geometry (top-to-base <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> and height-to-base <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio)</b> of steel chimneys. The objective of the present study is to justify the code criteria with regard to basic dimensions of industrial steel chimney. A total of 66 numbers self supporting steel flared unlined chimneys with different top-to-base <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> and height-to-base <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> were considered for this study.

This equation relates the heat flux to the wall superheat raised to a power n. The value of n was observed to vary from 3. 08 to 1. 57 for a length to <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> of 18 and 4. 00 to 3. 09 for a length to <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> of 33. Finally, the experimental data were compared to two correlations, that of Chen and Gungor - Winterton. Both correlations were found to predict higher values for the heat flux than were experimentally obtained...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{deals with the}} shedding of vortices and flow interference between two circular cylinders in a side-by-side arrangement. Simulations are carried out using commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT- 6. 2. The flow field around the cylinders is modeled in two-dimensions with the axis of the cylinder perpendicular to the direction of flow. The cylinder is modeled as a circle and a square flow domain is created around the cylinder. The calculations are carried out on a quadrilateral mesh. The simulations are performed for a Reynolds number of 200. The mesh is finer close to the cylinder wall {{in order to have}} a better description of the boundary layer. Contours of vorticity, variation of lift and drag coefficients, force time histories are presented. A mean repulsive lift force exists between the cylinders and the lift force steadily decreases with increasing length to <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio.</b> For length to <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> ≤ 2. 0, flopping phenomenon is observed whereas for length to <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> > 2. 0, the lift fluctuation is synchronized and is in anti-phase. The results of the present work show that the drag coefficient is slightly higher for length to <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2. 0. Beyond this ratio, the drag coefficient on either cylinder falls. For length to <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3. 0 and 4. 0, the power spectrum estimation of the lift coefficient shows a very distinctive peak at Strouhal number of 0. 21...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSheet {{metal parts}} with bosses or small pins can be {{manufactured}} by sheet extrusion or half blanking {{with a negative}} clearance. The {{purpose of this study}} is to understand the forming behavior of the boss with a small punch/die <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio.</b> Two kinds of pure aluminum sheets of 2 mm thick were applied and a boss of 1 mm in diameter was formed on the sheet. In the case without a blank holder, increase in a punch/die <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> caused local thickening around the boss and the boss height became lower than that expected. By applying appropriate blank holding force, the boss height was rather improved, nevertheless it didn’t reach the ideally calculated value. The error of the boss height became larger when increasing in a punch/die <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> and when using the annealed material...|$|R
40|$|The steady {{motion of}} spheres {{representing}} particles inside tubes filled with different fluids {{has been investigated}} using both a finite-element and a finite-volume method. The rheology of the fluids has been modelled by the power-law able to describe the shear-thinning (pseudoplastic) behaviour {{of a series of}} polymer solutions. New results have been obtained for a series of tube/sphere <b>diameter</b> <b>ratios</b> in order to investigate the wall effects on the drag exerted by the fluid on the sphere. The results agree well with previous simulations for an unbounded medium (infinite <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio).</b> Experimental investigations have also been carried out and simulated, and the results compare favourably with the experiments. The present simulations revealed the convergence of the drag coefficient to a constant value independent of tube-to-sphere <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> when the power-law index approache...|$|R

The influence of long <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> to interface radius and extrusion swell were analyzed.
