25|$|An {{inventory}} of 1802 suggests that spinning {{was to be}} carried out on hand-powered spinning jennies, with a waterwheel (costing £450) powering the <b>carding</b> <b>machines.</b> By 1816 the mill contained worsted spinning frames, and in 1822 a new waterwheel costing £1,500 had been installed.|$|E
25|$|The cotton {{comes off}} of the picking machine in laps, and is then taken to <b>carding</b> <b>machines.</b> The carders line up the fibres nicely to make them easier to spin. The carding machine {{consists}} mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered in small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the carding machine {{in the form of}} a sliver; a large rope of fibres.|$|E

25|$|Restoration of {{the mill}} began in earnest in May 2007 with Tracy Wells as foreman of the project for Pritchett Brothers. The first task was to remove the old equipment, tools, and the {{remaining}} features of the general store and fabric-making, including two <b>carding</b> <b>machines.</b> The old turbines were cleaned, and the stone foundation was repaired by lifting the mill from its moorings. In September 2007 the outside work was stopped for the year. The mill workings, currently held in storage at Salem, were re-installed in the spring 2008. A grand opening {{of the mill}} is planned for the fall of 2008, {{in time for the}} 200th anniversary of the first Beck's Mill.|$|E

Peel {{came to see the}} destruction as fortuitous, as he then turned to Richard Arkwright's carding [...] "engine". By 1795, Peel's family run company, Peel & Co., was the largest in the cotton industry with twenty-three mills around the north west of England, fourteen more than their closest competitor.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis Paul {{patented}} {{the roller}} spinning frame and the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing wool {{to a more}} even thickness. The technology was developed {{with the help of}} John Wyatt of Birmingham. [...] Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey. In 1743 a factory opened in Northampton with 50 spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt's machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by Daniel Bourn in Leominster, but this burnt down. Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented <b>carding</b> <b>machines</b> in 1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first cotton spinning mill. Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright in his water frame and Samuel Crompton in his spinning mule.|$|E

60|$|As for Janet, {{she was as}} one brought {{suddenly}} to the realization of a miracle in whose presence she had lived {{for many years and}} never before suspected; the miracle of machinery, of the triumph of man over nature. In the brief space of an hour she beheld the dirty bales flung off the freight cars on the sidings transformed into delicate fabrics wound from the looms; cotton that only last summer, perhaps, while she sat typewriting at her window, had been growing in the fields of the South. She had seen it torn by the bale-breakers, blown into the openers, loosened, cleansed, and dried; taken up by the lappers, pressed into batting, and passed on to the <b>carding</b> <b>machines,</b> to emerge like a wisp of white smoke in a sliver and coil automatically in a can. Once more it was flattened into a lap, given to a comber that felt out its fibres, removing with superhuman precision those for the finer fabric too short, thrusting it forth again in another filmy sliver ready for the drawing frames. Six of these gossamer ropes were taken up, and again six. Then came the Blubbers and the roving frames, twisting and winding, the while maintaining the most delicate of tensions lest the rope break, running the strands together into a thread constantly growing stronger and finer, until it was ready for spinning.|$|E
50|$|In 1748, Daniel Bourn and Lewis Paul {{separately}} obtained patents for <b>carding</b> <b>machines,</b> {{which were}} presumably {{used in the}} Leominster and Northampton mills respectively.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a <b>carding</b> <b>machine</b> and twisting machine for produce eri fiber and yarn. A <b>carding</b> <b>machine</b> decomposes degumming cocoons and forms it into cohesiveness silk filament. Silk filament was then spun and twisted in twisting machine. Factors to test machine functionality were teeth of carding head which were aligned in straight and zigzag pattern. Speeds of fiber feeding were 0. 24, 0. 32, and 0. 4 meter per minute. From the experiments of <b>carding</b> <b>machine,</b> it can be found that almost cocoons were decomposed when using zigzag pattern. Speed of cocoon feeder was about 0. 24 meter per minute. From twisting machine testing, results pointed out different speed of fiber feeding provided different size of yarn. The properties of eri silk obtained from machine were similar with eri silk produced from traditional method. Therefore, <b>carding</b> <b>machine</b> and twisting machine developed in this research can help farmers to increase production and support the eri silk industry development...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to study the working of two {{different}} combinations of stationary flats having different wire points per square inch and its impact on waste percentage reduction and cotton fiber behavior.

This research is partial to the performance of stationary flats only, and does not involve other parts of <b>carding</b> <b>machine.</b> Further research may be carried out on other parts of the <b>carding</b> <b>machine</b> as well.
