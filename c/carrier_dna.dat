A direct method for restoring the immunologic balance in RA is use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) for silencing the TNFalpha transcript. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the therapeutic effect of systemic administration of TNFalpha siRNA in an experimental model of RA, optimizing its delivery using new liposome formulations. METHODS: Murine macrophages were transfected with siRNA targeting TNFalpha, and expression was measured. The therapeutic effect in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was assessed after intravenous delivery of TNFalpha siRNA. Delivery was optimized using a <b>carrier</b> <b>DNA</b> for complexation with the cationic liposome RPR 209120 /DOPE. Levels of TNFalpha and other cytokines were measured in sera and joint tissue-conditioned media. Biodistribution was determined using a fluorescent siRNA. RESULTS: In vitro, TNFalpha siRNA efficiently and specifically modulated the expression of TNFalpha at both the messenger RNA and protein levels. In vivo, complete cure of CIA was observed when TNFalpha siRNA was administered weekly, complexed with the liposome and combined with <b>carrier</b> <b>DNA.</b> Inhibition (50 - 70 %) of articular and systemic TNFalpha secretion was detected in the siRNA-injected groups, which correlated with a decrease in the levels of interleukin- 6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1.

At a high DNA dose, formulation with the tetrafunctional block copolymers 304 (molecular weight [MW] 1, 650) and 704 (MW 5, 500) and the triblock copolymer Lutrol (MW 8, 600) increased βGal-specific interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) responses 2 – 2. 5 -fold.

A single injection of 2 µg pCMV-βGal with 704 gave humoral and ELISPOT responses equivalent to those obtained with 100 µg naked DNA and conferred protection in tumor vaccination models.
