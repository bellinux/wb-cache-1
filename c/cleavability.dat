50|$|Knowledge of {{the protein}} {{cleavage}} sites by HIV protease can provide very useful information for finding effective inhibitors against the culprit enzyme, as elaborated by Kuo-Chen Chou.According to Fisher’s lock-and-key model proposed by Hermann Emil Fischer in 1884 and Koshland’s induced fit theory by Daniel E. Koshland, Jr. in 1958, given a peptide, the prerequisite condition {{for it to}} be cleaved by HIV-protease is a good fit and binding between the substrate and the enzyme’s active site. However, such a peptide, after a modification on its scissile bond with some simple chemical procedure, will completely lose its <b>cleavability</b> but it can still tightly bind to the enzyme’s active site. According to Kuo-Chen Chou, the molecule thus modified can be likened to a ‘‘distorted key”, which can be inserted into a lock but can neither open the lock nor automatically get out from it. That is why a molecule modified from a cleavable peptide can spontaneously become a competitive inhibitor against the enzyme.|$|E

They are defects which weaken {{timber and}} lower its value for structural purposes where strength {{is an important}} consideration. The weakening effect is much more serious when timber is subjected to forces {{perpendicular to the grain}} and/or tension than when under load along the grain and/or compression. The extent to which knots affect the strength of a beam depends upon their position, size, number, and condition. A knot on the upper side is compressed, while one on the lower side is subjected to tension. If there is a season check in the knot, as is often the case, it will offer little resistance to this tensile stress. Small knots, however, may be located along the neutral plane of a beam and increase the strength by preventing longitudinal shearing. Knots in a board or plank are least injurious when they extend through it at right angles to its broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam do not weaken it. Sound knots which occur in the central portion one-fourth the height of the beam from either edge are not serious defects. Samuel J. Record ...|$|E

40|$|To obtain direct {{evidence}} for a relationship between hemagglutinin (HA) <b>cleavability</b> and the virulence of avian influenza A viruses, we generated a series of HA cleavage mutants from a virulent virus, A/turkey/Ontario/ 7732 / 66 (H 5 N 9), by reverse genetics. A transfectant virus containing the wild-type HA with R-R-R-K-K-R at the cleavage site, which was readily cleaved by endogenous proteases in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF), was highly virulent in intramuscularly or intranasally/orally inoculated chickens. By contrast, a mutant containing the HA with an avirulent-like sequence (R-E-T-R) at the cleavage site, which was not cleaved by the proteases in CEF, was avirulent in chickens, indicating that a genetic alteration confined to the HA cleavage site can affect <b>cleavability</b> and virulence. Mutant viruses with HA cleavage site sequences of T-R-R-K-K-R or T-T-R-K-K-R were as virulent as viruses with the wild-type HA, whereas a mutant with a two-amino-acid deletion but retention of four consecutive basic residues (R-K-K-R) was as avirulent as a virus with the avirulent-type HA. Interestingly, although a mutant containing an HA with R-R-R-K-T-R, which has reduced <b>cleavability</b> in CEF, was as virulent as viruses with high HA <b>cleavability</b> when given intramuscularly, it was less virulent when given intranasally/orally.

A space X is cleavable over a space Y if it is cleavable over Y along all subsets A of X. In this thesis we prove three results regarding <b>cleavability.</b> First we discover the conditions under which <b>cleavability</b> of an infinite compactum X over a first-countable scattered linearly ordered topological space (LOTS) Y implies embeddability of X into Y. In particular, we provide a class of counter-examples in which <b>cleavability</b> does not imply embeddability, and show that if X is an infinite compactum cleavable over ω 1, the first uncountable ordinal, then X is embeddable into ω 1. We secondly show that if X is an infinite compactum cleavable over any ordinal, then X must be homeomorphic to an ordinal. X must also therefore be a LOTS. This answers two fundamental questions in the area of <b>cleavability.</b> We also leave it as an open question whether <b>cleavability</b> of an infinite compactum X over an uncountable ordinal λ implies X is embeddable into λ. Lastly, we show that if X is an infinite compactum cleavable over a separable LOTS Y such that for some continuous function f from X to Y, the set of points on which f is not injective is scattered, then X is a LOTS.

40|$|The <b>cleavability</b> of the {{hemagglutinin}} (HA) molecule {{is related}} to the virulence of avian influenza A viruses, but its influence on human influenza virus strains is unknown. Two structural features are involved in the cleavage of avian influenza A virus HAs: a series of basic amino acids at the cleavage site and an oligosaccharide side chain in the near vicinity. The importance of these properties in the <b>cleavability</b> of a human influenza A virus (A/Aichi/ 2 / 68) HA was investigated by using mutants that contained or lacked an oligosaccharide side chain and had either four or six basic amino acids. All mutants except the one that contains a single mutation at the glycosylation site were cleaved, although not completely, demonstrating that a series of basic amino acids confers susceptibility to cellular cleavage enzymes among human influenza virus HAs. The mutants containing six basic amino acids at the cleavage site showed limited polykaryon formation upon exposure to low pH, indicating that cleavage was adequate to impart fusion activity to the HA. Deletion of the potential glycosylation site had no effect on the <b>cleavability</b> of these mutants; hence, the oligosaccharide side chain appears to have no role in human influenza virus HA cleavage. The inability to induce high <b>cleavability</b> in a human influenza A virus HA by insertion of a series of basic amino acids at the cleavage site indicates that other, as yet unidentified structural features are needed to enhance the susceptibility of these HAs to cellular proteases.

40|$|AbstractTo {{address the}} {{regulation}} {{and evolution of}} precursor protein <b>cleavability</b> in caliciviruses, we examined constraints on diversity of upstream regions of calicivirus precursor cleavage sites. We performed alanine scanning and supplementary mutagenesis of amino acids at P 1, P 2, P 3, and P 4 sites using four viruses representing the four major genera of the family Caliciviridae. This study complements previous mutagenesis studies and shows strong restrictions in mutations at the P 1 and P 4 sites for effective cleavage reactions. By contrast, such restrictions were less frequently observed at the P 2 and P 3 sites. Shannon entropy analysis of the reported sequences showed that the P 2, P 3, and P 4 sites allow variations in amino acid size within a calicivirus genus whereas the P 1 sites do not. Notably, the human sapovirus precursor protein exceptionally retains a basic rather than aromatic amino acid at the P 4 site of the NS 4 /NS 5 cleavage site in reported strains, and a substitution from basic to aromatic amino acid significantly enhanced <b>cleavability</b> at this site. Taken together, these data suggest the existence of (i) structural constraints on the P 1 site that restrict size changes within each calicivirus genus, (ii) plastic substrate surfaces that accommodate size variation at the P 2, P 3, and P 4 sites and modulate their own cleavabilities, and (iii) biological constraints on the P 4 site that maintain the lower <b>cleavability</b> of the NS 4 /NS 5 site in sapovirus...|$|E

The same proteases that were required for activation of infectivity of the mutants also activated haemolysis and cell-fusing properties. The protease activation (pa) -mutants were nonpathogenic for chickens, but induced a protective immune response against a highly pathogenic challenge virus. The failure of the mutants to be activated by trypsin, but instead to be activated by the other proteases employed, was related to amino acid exchanges around the HA cleavage site. The <b>cleavability</b> of the chymotrypsin and elastase pa-mutants is most likely determined by replacement of Arg- 1 by neutral amino acids such as Ile, Thr, Met or Leu, depending on the substrate specificity of the activating proteases.

The number of basic residues at the cleavage site, which consists of a single arginine with wild-type hemagglutinin, was increased by inserting two, three, or four additional arginines. Like wild-type hemagglutinin, mutants with up to three additional arginines were not cleaved in CV- 1 cells, but insertion of four arginines resulted in activation. When the oligosaccharide at asparagine 22 of the HA 1 subunit of the hemagglutinin was removed by site-directed mutagenesis of the respective glycosylation site, only three inserted arginines were required to obtain cleavage.

40|$|Cohesin is {{a protein}} complex that is {{required}} to hold sister chromatids together. Cleavage of the Scc 1 subunit of cohesin by the protease separase releases the complex from chromosomes and thereby enables the separation of sister chromatids in anaphase. In vertebrate cells, the bulk of cohesin dissociates from chromosome arms already during prophase and prometaphase without cleavage of Scc 1. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk 1) and Aurora-B are required for this dissociation process, and Plk 1 can phosphorylate the cohesin subunits Scc 1 and SA 2 in vitro, consistent with the possibility that cohesin phosphorylation by Plk 1 triggers the dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms. However, this hypothesis has not been tested yet, and in budding yeast {{it has been found}} that phosphorylation of Scc 1 by the Polo-like kinase Cdc 5 enhances the <b>cleavability</b> of cohesin, but does not lead to separase-independent dissociation of cohesin from chromosomes. To address the functional significance of cohesin phosphorylation in human cells, we have searched for phosphorylation sites on all four subunits of cohesin by mass spectrometry. We have identified numerous mitosis-specific sites on Scc 1 and SA 2, mutated them, and expressed nonphosphorylatable forms of both proteins stably at physiological levels in human cells. The analysis of these cells lines, in conjunction with biochemical experiments in vitro, indicate that Scc 1 phosphorylation is dispensable for cohesin dissociation from chromosomes in early mitosis but enhances the <b>cleavability</b> of Scc 1 by separase. In contrast, our data reveal that phosphorylation of SA 2 is essential for cohesin dissociation during prophase and prometaphase, but is not required for cohesin cleavage by separase. The similarity of the phenotype obtained after expression of nonphosphorylatable SA 2 in human cells to that seen after the depletion of Plk 1 suggests that SA 2 is the critical target of Plk 1 in the cohesin dissociation pathway. </p...|$|E

In this study, we constructed a reverse genetics system for recovery of infectious recombinant APMV- 2 strain Yucaipa (APMV- 2 /Yuc) from cloned cDNA. The rescued recombinant virus (rAPMV- 2) resembled the biological virus in growth properties in vitro and in pathogenicity in vivo. The reverse genetics system was used to analyze the role of the cleavage site of the fusion (F) protein in viral replication and pathogenesis. The cleavage site of APMV- 2 /Yuc (KPASR↓F) contains only a single basic residue (position − 1) that matches the preferred furin cleavage site [RX(K/R) R↓]. (Underlining indicates the basic amino acids at the F protein cleavage site, and the arrow indicates the site of cleavage.) Contrary to what would be expected for this cleavage sequence, APMV- 2 does not require, and is not augmented by, exogenous protease supplementation for growth in cell culture. However, it does not form syncytia, and the virus is avirulent in chickens. A total of 12 APMV- 2 mutants with F protein cleavage site sequences derived from APMV serotypes 1 to 9 were generated. These sites contain from 1 to 5 basic residues. Whereas a number of these cleavage sites are associated with protease dependence and lack of syncytium formation in their respective native viruses, when transferred into the APMV- 2 backbone, all of them conferred protease independence, syncytium formation, and increased replication in cell culture. Examination of selected mutants during a pulse-chase experiment demonstrated an increase in F protein cleavage compared to that for wild-type APMV- 2. Despite the gains in <b>cleavability,</b> replication, and syncytium formation, analysis of viral pathogenicity in 9 -day-old embryonated chicken eggs, 1 -day-old chicks, and 2 -week-old chickens showed that the F protein cleavage site mutants did not exhibit increased pathogenicity and remained avirulent. These results imply that structural features in addition to the cleavage site {{play a major role in}} the <b>cleavability</b> of the F protein and the activity of the cleaved protein. Furthermore, cleavage of the F protein is not a determinant of APMV- 2 pathogenicity in chickens...|$|E
