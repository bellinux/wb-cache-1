50|$|The typical MORGOIL tapered {{neck bearing}} {{assembly}} {{consists of a}} sleeve with a non-locking tapered bore that facilitates removal of the bearing <b>chock</b> <b>assembly</b> from the roll neck. The sleeve, keyed to the neck to prevent creeping during operation, produces a slight interference fit on the roll neck {{by means of the}} push-up force used to mount the bearing on the roll. The outside diameter of the sleeve is ground and polished serving as the journal surface of the bearing. Sleeve wall thickness variation is controlled to 0.005 mm (0.0002 in.) to minimize roll force variation.|$|E
