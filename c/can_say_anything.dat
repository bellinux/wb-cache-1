5|$|McCroon {{breaks into}} Craven's house intent on killing him. Craven demands McCroon tell him {{who he is}} working for but McCroon is shot by a police {{marksman}} before he <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b> Through a contact of Mac (Struan Roger), a colleague from his time in Northern Ireland, Craven gains access to a terminal connected to the MI5 computer. He checks the MI5 records for GAIA, Northmoor and Emma and learns that McCroon was acting on the orders of Northmoor Security. He also obtains a three-dimensional map of Northmoor from the computer. Craven contacts Jedburgh and asks him to accompany him inside Northmoor.|$|E
25|$|The main {{factor that}} {{encourages}} cyber bullying {{is the fact}} that a cyber bully can hide behind the shield of online anonymity. In other words, social media magnifies the face-to-face social space into a virtual space where a cyber bully <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the victims without the pressure of facing them.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jenna, {{worn out}} from working on TGS {{during the day}} and on her {{unlicensed}} Janis Joplin biopic at night, visits Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) for help so she can work on both. He gives Jenna a military-grade experimental drug currently being tested on rats to stay awake. At the same time, Tracy believes that having enough money to pay FCC fines means that he <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> on television, and he says to Liz, [...] "I can even say what Ernest Borgnine whispered to me." [...] As a result, Tracy curses on The Martha Stewart Show, and after learning that the show's advertisers are pulling out, due to his actions, decides to sponsor the show. Meanwhile, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, Jack Donaghy, desperately tries to find a name for a pocket microwave oven that is not offensive in any language. With Liz gone, Jack assigns the TGS writing staff, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell), J. D. Lutz (John Lutz), Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), and Sue LaRoche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway), to this task. After their unsuccessful attempts, Kenneth suggests [...] "The Funcooker" [...] which Jack decides is the perfect name.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{learned from}} an ex-MI5 officer {{that it is}} common for intelligence gatherers who spend most of their work listening in to other people {{to fall in love with}} civilians through just their voices. This story was the basis of Ruth wanting to go out with John in [...] "Love and Death". Khoury based [...] "Outsiders" [...] on Internet security. He already became intoned with the area, as he once worked with an internet company. Although the story is dramatised, Khoury did research on what was feasible, such as if one man and a laptop could theoretically bring Britain to its knees. Also in the episode, the G algorithm is based on an actual computer programme. [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] deals with interrogation and torture. Walters realised that torture is counterproductive as the suspects <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> the interrogators want to hear, but rationalises that Adam is an expert in that field. To get the interrogation as true as possible, the producers consulted with ex-Army advisors who were trained in questioning terror suspects. As the episode was first broadcast, a prison abuse scandal in Iraq was put on the news. In response to this, Kudos director Stephen Garrett stated [...] "Spooks is really well researched and sometimes we look like we're ahead of the game. It's just we know stuff that's happening, and it'll come out in the news a bit later on." [...] In the same episode, the weapons caches came from a true story that the Russians hid weapons in Britain during the Cold War, according to Collins.|$|E
2500|$|Bloomberg {{was asked}} if he was {{satisfied}} that [...] "he is indeed a man of peace given his background where he's supposedly supported Hamas, blamed the U.S. for 9/11 attacks?" [...] The mayor responded: [...] "My job is not to vet clergy in this city.... Everybody has a right to their opinions. You don't have to worship there.... this country is not built around ... only those ... clergy people that we agree with..... It's built around freedom. That's the wonderful thing about the First Amendment – you <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> you want." ...|$|E

[...] But if Harrison had sworn affidavits or photographic/audio proof, the story would go beyond innuendo. Film historian Mary Desjardins described Confidentials editorial style as using [...] "research methods and writing techniques that recycled old stories or created 'composite' facts {{as the basis of}} new ones." [...] Robert Harrison himself described it thus: [...] "Once we establish the star in the hay and that's documented, we <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> we want and I think we make them {{a hell of a lot}} more interesting than they really are. What's a guy gonna do, sue us and admit he was in the hay with the dame, but claim he didn't do all the other things we dress the story with?" [...] After the [...] "facts" [...] of an article were assembled, a staff of four would rewrite it several times to achieve Confidentials [...] "toboggan ride" [...] style: [...] "racy and free of embroidery, keeps the reader on the edge of his seat."

[...] But if Harrison had sworn affidavits or photographic/audio proof, the story would go beyond innuendo (unlike an earlier Hollywood scandal publisher, Frederic Girnau of the Coast Reporter—who was tried for libeling Clara Bow—Harrison usually protected himself with signed affidavits). Film historian Mary Desjardins described Confidentials editorial style as using [...] "research methods and writing techniques that recycled old stories or created 'composite' facts {{as the basis of}} new ones."

2500|$|Under Winchell's sponsorship, Howard Rushmore {{became the}} chief {{editor of a}} New York scandal magazine, Confidential. Its publisher, Robert Harrison, began as an office boy and later writer for Bernarr McFadden's New York Graphic during the 1920s, an {{ancestor}} of the supermarket tabloids that would emerge in the 1960s. It was at the Graphic where the young Harrison first met Walter Winchell. As an adult Harrison was on the editorial staff of the Motion Picture Herald, a trade publication whose conservative Catholic owner, Martin Quigley, Sr., had {{close ties to the}} Hays Office. Having learned from Quigley what he could get away with legally, Harrison struck out on his own with a series of non-pornographic [...] "cheesecake" [...] magazines. Supposedly inspired by the Kefauver Committee hearings, Harrison later launched a tabloid-style gossip magazine. It concentrated on exposing the substance abuse habits, criminal records and hidden political and sexual preferences of celebrities. Film historian Mary Desjardins described Confidentials editorial style as using [...] "research methods and writing techniques that recycled old stories or created 'composite' facts as the basis of new ones." [...] Robert Harrison himself described it thus: [...] "Once we establish the star in the hay and that's documented, we <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> we want and I think we make them {{a hell of a lot}} more interesting than they really are. What's a guy gonna do, sue us and admit he was in the hay with the dame, but claim he didn't do all the other things we dress the story with?" [...] Before Rushmore's tenure at Confidential, Harrison published stories like “Is It True What They Say About Johnnie Ray?" [...] and [...] "Why Joe DiMaggio Is Striking Out with Marilyn Monroe!" [...] With [...] "Winchell Was Right About Josephine Baker!", Harrison came out in support of his childhood mentor at the Graphic during the Stork Club controversy. Though Harrison would publish non-show business stories involving [...] "racketeering, consumer scams and politicians' peccadilloes," [...] "exposés of star secrets" [...] became Confidentials prime focus.|$|E
