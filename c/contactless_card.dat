40|$|Abstract. <b>Contactless</b> <b>cards</b> {{are smart}} cards with {{microprocessor}} cores. Their applications of are very popular, such as public transports, access control, cashless payment, campus solution and so on. Reader {{is an essential}} part for smart card applications. It can identify cards, read/write data on cards. Microcontrollers are common hardware for embedded applications. With microcontrollers, the readers of <b>contactless</b> <b>cards</b> will be smart and easy to be used. In this paper, smart cads, <b>contactless</b> <b>cards,</b> readers, microcontrollers and design of a reader with microcontrollers are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|An Oyster card {{can have}} a longer term [...] "season" [...] ticket loaded onto it (either at a ticket office or on line). [...] Such a ticket can start on any day and be valid {{for a minimum of}} seven days and a maximum of one year. [...] Unlike an Oyster card, a <b>contactless</b> <b>card</b> can {{automatically}} apply a seven-day travel card rate. [...] If the card is regularly used between any Monday to Sunday period, an automatic cap is applied. [...] The seven-day period is fixed at Monday to Sunday, it cannot be any seven-day period, unlike a seven-day ticket applied to an Oyster card. There is currently no automatic cap for longer periods.|$|E
2500|$|Transport for London [...] started {{accepting}} contactless debit {{and credit}} cards on London Buses on 13 December 2012, {{with the aim of}} expanding the new system to other transport modes by 2013. [...] Transport for London further expanded the use of contactless cards to the Underground, Tram and the Docklands Railway from September 2014. [...] It is reported that TfL's long-term aim is to stop handling money and collecting fares altogether. [...] The same requirement to touch in and out on underground services applies to contactless cards. [...] The same price capping that applies to the use of Oyster cards applies to the use of contactless cards (provided the same card is used for the day's journeys). [...] The fare paid every day is settled with the bank and appears on the debit or credit card statement. Detailed usage data is written to Transport for London's systems and is available for customers who register their contactless cards with Transport for London. Unlike an Oyster card, a <b>contactless</b> <b>card</b> does not store credit (beyond the holder's credit limit) and there is no need or facility to add credit to the card.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to provide a comprehensive view {{on the issue of}} {{contactless}} payments in various forms, as well as capture the actual situation in the field of contactless payments. The first chapter is devoted to the emergence and development of payment cards as a forerunner of <b>contactless</b> <b>cards.</b> The second chapter characterizes <b>contactless</b> <b>cards</b> as a new payment product. Additionally it also includes a description of the technology, which is used for this kind of cards. Chapter also deals with the arrival of <b>contactless</b> <b>cards</b> to Czech Republic and Slovakia. The topic of third chapter is Near Field Communication, special technology, which is used for contactless payments and also for the other forms of contactless payments, such as mobile payments. The fourth chapter talks about mobile services that are actually used for mobile payments. These services are not available in our region yet, but we expect their further expansion into European countries in the future. Finally, the last chapter includes an analysis of data, where we used statistical data of contactless payments in Slovakia and Czech Republic. The aim was to outline the development of contactless payments in individual quarters in both countries separately and to compare the data of <b>contactless</b> <b>cards</b> and payments in these countries...|$|R
