5|$|With Montreal, Linden {{was often}} injured, and only {{appeared}} in 50 games {{during his first}} season with the Canadiens, scoring 30 points, while the next year he appeared in 57 games, scoring 33 points. While with the Canadiens, he signed a four-year contract worth $15 million; however, he was traded {{for the third time}} in his career, this time to the Washington Capitals, going with Dainius Zubrus, and New Jersey's 2nd round <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2001 NHL Entry Draft (later traded to Tampa Bay who picked Andreas Holmqvist) in exchange for Richard Zednik, Jan Bulis, and Washington's 1st round <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2001 Draft (Alexander Perezhogin).

5|$|Bure {{held out}} {{well into the}} 1998–99 season until he was traded on January 17, 1999, to the Florida Panthers, with Bret Hedican, Brad Ference, and Vancouver's third-round <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2000 NHL Entry Draft (Robert Fried) for Ed Jovanovski, Dave Gagner, Mike Brown, Kevin Weekes, and Florida's first-round <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2000 draft (Nathan Smith).

After the trade was completed, Bure {{explained}} that he felt alienated from Canucks' management after arriving in North America having defected from Russia. He claimed he had been in Los Angeles for two weeks before any Canucks' representative came to see him, as well as several bitter contract negotiationsparticularly those of 1994. He also claimed that someone within the Canucks' management planted the constant allegations that he threatened not to play during the 1994 playoff run. Bure's agent at the time, Ron Salcer, also believed the story.|$|E

5|$|Declassified wartime {{documents}} show that Simonds, {{along with several}} others in the Allied high command, had likely been notified on July 23 of a massive German buildup on the ridge.

5|$|Fruit {{was popular}} {{and could be}} served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common {{ingredient}} in many cooked dishes. Since sugar and honey were both expensive, it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort. The fruits of <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), pomegranates, quinces, and, of course, grapes. Farther north, apples, pears, plums, and strawberries were more common. Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.|$|E

5|$|Governor David Paterson's {{selection}} process {{began with a}} number of prominent names and high-ranking New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion. She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that she could be a good complement to Chuck Schumer. Gillibrand was presumed a likely <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days before the official announcement. On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.|$|E
5|$|He {{played as}} a 13- and 14-year-old with the Peninsule Acadien Lynx, {{and with the}} Miramichi Rivermen from ages 15–16, both local minor ice hockey teams. After being the third overall <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2003 QMJHL draft, Bourdon left home when he was 16, {{returning}} in the off-season {{to live with his}} mother. Upon turning professional and signing his first contract, he anonymously donated C$10,000 to the local minor hockey association for families who could not afford equipment. His donation was posthumously revealed by his former bantam hockey coach, Gilles Cormier, who managed the local arena at the time of Bourdon's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, type 1 and 2 {{monovalent}} oral poliovirus vaccine (MOPV) was licensed, and in 1962, type 3 MOPV was licensed. In 1963, trivalent OPV (TOPV) was licensed, {{and became}} the vaccine of <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States and most other countries of the world, largely replacing the inactivated polio vaccine. A second wave of mass immunizations led to a further dramatic {{decline in the number}} of polio cases. Between 1962 and 1965 about 100 million Americans (roughly 56% of the population at that time) received the Sabin vaccine. The result was a substantial reduction in the number of poliomyelitis cases, even from the much reduced levels following the introduction of the Salk vaccine.|$|E

5|$|The NS-10 {{displaced}} the Auratone 5C Sound Cube as the nearfield monitor of <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s and was recognised for {{its ability}} to reveal shortcomings in recordings. It probably first reached American shores through a recording engineer's visit to Japan. The engineer, likely to have been Greg Ladanyi, monitored a recording session through the speaker in a Japanese studio and brought a pair back on his return to the US. Ladanyi then began using the speakers in a Los Angeles studio. Other engineers heard the NS-10 {{for the first time and}} were impressed by its sound. Its use spread to New York where the NS-10 was adopted at The Power Station and other studios.|$|E

5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the vaccine of <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. The first dose of polio vaccine is given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, a second dose is given at 4 months of age. The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age. A booster vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence. Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Before {{broadcasting}} began, the BBC considered airing {{the show}} on a Saturday night timeslot as its research found that any potential viewers {{were less likely to}} watch television on Saturdays than most other nights of the week; the BBC hoped that Spooks would boost its timeslot. However, the series instead broadcast on Mondays. The series began broadcasting on 13 May 2002 on BBC One during the 9 to 10pm timeslot, and continued on every Monday night until 17 June 2002, {{with the exception of the}} fourth episode, which was viewed on Tuesday 4 June starting at 10pm, due to an overrun of the coverage of Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee. The episodes were also repeated on the digital channel BBC <b>Choice.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> US, the first series aired in mid-2003 on A. However, each episode had approximately ten minutes edited out to accommodate for advert breaks. The DVD release of the series in America contained the uncut episodes. The first series was later repeated on BBC America, alongside the second series starting in June 2007.|$|E
5|$|Elijah Hise, Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, was {{the leading}} {{candidate}} for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, but after the Whig nomination of Crittenden, Hise withdrew from consideration. The Democratic state convention then nominated Congressman Linn Boyd, but Boyd also declined the nomination. The Democrats were finally able to nominate Henderson lawyer Lazarus W. Powell. As Crittenden canvassed the state, his opponents charged him with disloyalty to Clay because he refused to support him in the 1848 election. Crittenden maintained that he supported Clay for the presidency over anyone else, but he had believed that Clay {{did not intend to}} seek the Whig nomination in 1848. After Clay announced his candidacy, Crittenden said, he remained neutral in the Whigs' <b>choice.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> gubernatorial election, Crittenden defeated Powell by a vote of 65,860 to 57,397.
