40|$|Thermoplastic {{composites}} made {{of polypropylene}} (PP) and E-glass fibers were investigated experimentally {{as well as}} theoretically for two new classes of product designs. ^ The first application was for reinforcement of wood. Commingled PP/glass yarn was consolidated and bonded on wood panel using a tie layer. The processing parameters, including temperature, pressure, heating time, cooling time, bonding strength, and bending strength were tested experimentally and evaluated analytically. The thermoplastic adhesive interface was investigated with environmental scanning electron microscopy. The wood/composite structural design was optimized and evaluated using a Graphic Method. ^ In the second application, we evaluated use of thermoplastic composites for explosion containment in an arrester. PP/glass yarn was fabricated in a sleeve form and wrapped around the arrester. After consolidation, the flexible <b>composite</b> <b>sleeve</b> forms a solid composite shell. The composite shell acts as a protection layer in a surge test to contain the fragments of the arrester. The manufacturing process for forming the composite shell was designed. Woven, knitted, and braided textile composite shells made of commingled PP/glass yarn were tested and evaluated. Mechanical performance of the woven, knitted, and braided composite shells was examined analytically. The theoretical predictions were used to verify the experimental results. ...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical damage {{involving}} dents with gouges {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of transmission pipeline failures in terms of both static and cyclic pressure loading. Because of the severity of this defect type, pipeline companies are required to respond to these anomalies by either removing damaged sections or repair using welded sleeves. For more than 10 years, composite materials have been used to repair corroded pipelines and their use has gained wide acceptance across the pipeline industry. Numerous systems have been tested with results being presented in the open literature. Testing was recently performed to assess the use of a water-activated composite repair system, Aquawrap®, in terms of its ability to repair mechanical damage subjected to cyclic pressure service. The Aquawrap ® repair system has been extensively tested on corrosion defects but testing on pipes with dents had not been done. The water activated pre-preg urethane resin system offers excellent long tern (creep-rupture) strength combined with easy low cost field installation. Pipes having diameter to wall thickness ratios ranging from 34 to 68 were fitted with dents and gouges. Repair involved removing the gouged material of the pipe after indentation and repairing using the <b>composite</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The result of this specific test program showed that on-average the fatigue life for mechanically-damaged pipes can be increased on the order of three orders of magnitude when repaired by grinding and installing composite sleeves. This paper provides details on the methodology of the test program, results, and most importantly, information that can be used by operators in repairing their pipeline systems...|$|E
40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page, viewed on October 1, 2012 Thesis advisor: Kevin Z. TrumanVitaIncludes bibliographic {{references}} (p. [65]) Thesis (M. S.) [...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 Nonlinear simulations {{were used to}} predict and further understand the load transfer between trunnion shafts and yoke plates within a tainter gate trunnion assembly. Traditionally, yoke plates have been sized for an average stress based on the projected bearing area between the trunnion shaft and the yoke plate; however, finite element analyses proved that the stress is not uniform across {{the thickness of the}} yoke plate. The non-uniform stress distribution is attributed to the transverse shaft rotations that exist at the supports, concentrating load on the inboard edges of the yoke plates. Further study showed that the installation of either a bronze or <b>composite</b> <b>sleeve</b> between the yoke plate and the trunnion shaft will reduce the magnitude of the stress concentrations. A series of finite element models was developed to investigate the effects that shaft diameter, yoke plate thickness, and sleeve material have on the trunnion shaft to yoke plate load path. The finite element models were developed utilizing solid elements in order to capture the stress distribution across the yoke plate thickness by including multiple solution points across the yoke plate thickness. The analyses showed that a trend can be identified between the magnitude of the edge stress and the L/D ratio (shaft clear span to shaft diameter). As the L/D ratio of the system is increased, the magnitude of the edge stress increases; however, when a sleeve with a lower modulus of elasticity is introduced into the system, it is observed that the magnitude of the edge stress is reduced. The results proved that the reduction in stress is sensitive to shaft diameter, sleeve material, yoke plate thickness and L/D ratio. Typically for a yoke-shaft detail, the L/D ratio is designed to be close to 1. 0 in order to minimize the inboard edge stress; however, trunnion assemblies with larger L/D ratios are desirable from a tainter gate design perspective. Larger clear spans (L) simplify the connection between the strut arms and the trunnion assembly, and small shaft diameters (D) reduce the trunnion pin friction moment demand on the tainter gate strut arms. By installing a low modulus sleeve between the trunnion shaft and the yoke plate, the magnitude of the edge stress is reduced; therefore, the design can accommodate L/D ratios larger than 1. 0 while still keeping the stresses below an acceptable level. The simplified detailing and the reduction in strut arm demand will produce a more cost effective tainter gate design.

40|$|Abstract: A {{section of}} gas {{pipeline}} containing dormant stress corrosion cracks {{was removed from}} service and pressure cycled, and the crack growth from fatigue was measured. Crack growth {{was able to be}} conservatively calculated by BS 7910. Parts of the pipeline section had <b>composite</b> repair <b>sleeves</b> placed over it in order to compare fatigue crack growth of sleeved and unsleeved cracks. Sleeved cracks consistently showed less crack growth than unsleeved cracks; this is believed to be due to reduced hoop stresses in the pipe under the <b>composite</b> repair <b>sleeve</b> and reduced crack opening. A simple model of the sleeve repair was developed which was consistent with the measured strains in the pipe. The application pressure of the sleeve repair affects the amount of stress reduction in the pipe and the amount of crack growth experienced. Two possible methods of repair of SCC affected pipelines were validated by this work...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{fundamental}} research, including {{material selection}} and structure design of guide sleeves in 3 D weaving composites were investigated by three-point bending test, compression test and SEM observation. The {{results showed that}} carbon fiber <b>composite</b> guide <b>sleeves</b> had much higher interface bonding strength than titanium alloy guide sleeves, while worse flexural strength. There were three kind of structure design of the guide sleeves that were groove, rough surface and untreated surface. Compared with the structure of untreated surface, guide sleeves with grooves and with rough surface exhibited higher interface bonding strength, due to increasing the contact area between the guide sleeve and resin. But the guide sleeves with rough surface took the advantages of more simple to preparation and lower cost than those with the grooves. Furthermore the structure of groove could damage the flexural behavior of the guide sleeves...|$|R

40|$|Piles made of treated wood {{have been}} {{traditionally}} {{used for the}} construction of piers and other waterfront structures. The main concern related to wood piles is deterioration due to marine borers, which limits the lifespan and requires frequent repair and replacement. Furthermore, since the use of preservative treatments for wood piles has been reduced due to environmental concerns, there is a current need for efficient methods for wood pile protection. Marine borer activity in Maine coastal waters was assessed through a survey directed to harbor masters correlated with historic data. In order to illustrate the type and extent of wood pile deterioration, two case studies in Maine harbors are presented. A special prefabricated Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite shield or jacket was developed to repair wood piles in the field. FRP <b>composite</b> shells or <b>sleeve...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} shown that judicious {{integration}} of SMA wires or strips within composite components of certain geometries can lead to substantially enhanced dynamic effects within the component. These effects relate to natural frequency placements, mode shapes, and forced response characteristics, in particular. One application area of considerable interest involves the installation of bespoke technology exploiting this controllability within rotor systems, and this {{is the subject of this}} paper. It is shown that for a laboratory rotor system supported on two bearings, one of which is an active component comprising a cylindrical sleeve with specially configured and integrated SMA strips, the critical speeds can be usefully shifted about their nominal values. The paper shows how such an active bearing installation can be designed and discusses the many trade-offs required to optimise the performance in a useful way. It is shown that the principal compromises relate to stress in the composite host, physical size and shape of this component, quantity and distribution of SMA, and the local operating dynamics. It is also shown that glass-epoxy is superior to graphite-epoxy in terms of dynamic controllability for the <b>composite</b> cylindrical <b>sleeve</b> host component when used as an active support for one of the bearings, and that this useful performance can be accentuated by means of careful design. 1...|$|R
40|$|Braided <b>sleeve</b> <b>composite</b> shafts are {{produced}} and their torsional behavior is investigated. The braided sleeves are slid over an Al tube to create {{very strong and}} rigid tubular form shafts {{and they are in}} the form of 2 / 2 twill biaxial fiber fabric that has been woven into a continuous sleeve. Carbon and glass fibers braided sleeves are used for the fabrication of the composite shafts. VARTM (vacuum assisted resin transfer molding) and Vacuum Bagging are the two different types of manufacturing methods used in the study. Torsional behaviors of the shafts are investigated experimentally in terms of fabrication methods and various composite materials parameters such as fiber types, layer thickness, and ply angles. Comparing the two methods in terms of the torque forces and strain angles, the shafts producing entirely carbon fiber show the highest torque capacities; however, considering the cost and performance criteria, the hybrid shaft made up of carbon and glass fibers is the optimum solution for average demanded properties. Additionally, FE (finite element) model of the shafts was created and analyzed by using ANSYS workbench environment. Results of finite element analysis are compared with the values of twisting angle and torque obtained by experimental tests...|$|R
40|$|In {{the buried}} natural gas pipelines, many defects can occur by {{construction}} faults, corrosion, third-party interference and ground movement. Nowadays, selection of proper repair method on in-service natural gas pipeline {{is a matter}} of primary concern of Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS). Therefore, the systematic study has been required for the repair methods of API 5 L X 65 main pipeline operating under the internal pressure of 6. 9 MPa whose diameter is 762 mm and thickness is 17. 5 mm. The objective of this work is to investigate the fracture behavior of repaired pipe using full scale burst test and to select the appropriate repair method of in-service gas pipelines. We performed a series of full scale burst test for damaged pipe and each repaired pipe and analyzed the fracture behavior on API 5 L X 65 grade gas pipelines (diameter 762 mm, thickness 17. 5 mm) with mechanically machined defects.

40|$|An {{anchorage}} {{system for}} the tensile load transmission on the circular rods/tendons made from high-strength pultruded composites is proposed. The anchorage system comprises a composite rod having a spitted end with an inserted and glued metal wedge, a metal sleeve and pottant material, connecting <b>composite</b> rod and <b>sleeve.</b> The main objective of the system proposed is reduction of high stress concentration at the loaded end, which is typical for the bond-type anchor systems. The detailed analysis of 3 D stress-strain state of the anchor was performed for pultruded CFRP/epoxy rod, steel sleeve, aluminum wedge and epoxy resin pottant. All calculations were made with finite element method accounting for elastic and elastic-plastic behavior of epoxy resin in shear. The principal conclusion resulting from these FEM calculations implies that stress concentration at the loaded end of the anchor system keeps independently of the wedge location if the adhesive bond between composite rod and pottant is available. The possible technical solution of this problem may be creation of a friction interface between composite rod and pottant within the anchorage length. To verify this suggestion, 3 D contact FEM problems for the anchor system with the various lengths of friction interface were considered and analyzed. A series of the uniaxial tensile tests were carried out for the anchor systems made with CFRP pultruded rods of 5. 5 mm diameter, steel sleeve of 300 mm length, A 1 wedge of 110 mm length and cone angle of 7 ° embedded into epoxy resin. These experiments confirmed the working capacity of the anchor system proposed to transfer the tensile load on the high-strength UD CFRP/epoxy rod made by pultrusion. Failure of these CFRP rods was observed at the gauge section and maximum tensile stress of 2038 MPa. The anchor systems were fabricated with adhesive bond and only friction interaction between composite rod and pottant...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of advanced materials and technologies for application to new and existing structures, infrastructures, and equipment, aiming at improving {{their response to}} service and extreme loads, represents an emerging issue both from an academic and a professional viewpoint. Relevant performance assessment procedures, based on effective experimental verification methods [1] and refined numerical simulation models [2], are quickly evolving as well. New or improved building materials and innovative protection technologies offer updated solutions to the constantly increasing capacity requirements in structural, geotechnical, plant, and mechanical engineering design and rehabilitation. At the same time, they open novel and challenging research and application perspectives. The objective of this special issue was to provide readers with a representative outlook of the latest achievements in this field, including emerging aspects in modelling, testing, manufacturing, and practical implementation studies. The response {{of the scientific community}} was encouraging, with over 100 manuscripts submitted. The published papers offer a selected and articulated overview of the examined topics. Several papers are dedicated to concrete, reinforced concrete (R/C) members, and cement composites. J. Zhang and J. Li develop a semi-implicit constitutive integration algorithm for elastoplastic damage models, specially implemented for concrete. Literature mechanical tests of reinforced concrete components are numerically simulated, showing the effectiveness of the numerical method in history-dependent energy estimation within this class of nonlinear problems. H. Ding et al. examine the failure criteria and the constitutive relation of early-age concrete,with the aimof providing a theoretical basis for a novel strategy in early dismantling formwork construction of floors, aimed at accelerating formwork recycling as well as at reducing construction costs. Y. Shen et al. propose a paper spool-inspired anchoring method and a pretension procedure for carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets, for themanufacturing of prestressed concrete flat slabs. Laboratory flexural tests confirm the feasibility of this novel reinforcement technique, showing that uniformity of the fiber stress during tensioning is a key aspect for the successful application of prestress. Improved flexural calculation models for R/C members built with ultrahigh performance concrete (i. e., with cubic compressive strength exceeding 200 MPa) are presented by B. -I. Bae et al., who revise the normal stress distribution schemes adopted for standard concrete classes. The models are verified and validated by means Hindawi Publishing Corporation Advances in Materials Science and Engineering Volume 2016, Article ID 1854839, 3 pages [URL] 2 Advances in Materials Science and Engineering of laboratory flexural tests on representative specimens in this case too. High strength concrete materials, with cubic compressive strength ranging fromabout 80 MPa to 110 MPa, are examined in the paper of L. Zeng et al., as constituting materials of R/C beam-to-column joints encasing I-shaped hot-rolled steel profiles. An extensive campaign of cyclic tests on half-scale weak-type joints allows evaluating the beneficial influence of the adopted concrete classes in terms of strength {{and at the same time}} a minimal decrease in ductility, as compared to the cyclic performance of similar joints cast with standard concretes. Composite concretesteel tubular columns are the topic of the article by S. Jayaganesh et al. An experimental programme is carried out to evaluate the effects of the partial compression of square and circular cross sections, highlighting a reduction in strength in comparison to full compression, more accentuated in the case of the square shape. The correlation of the test results with the predictions of the analytical models proposed in the literature to account for these effects seems rather satisfactory. Another experimental activity is reported in the paper by J. Deng et al., dedicated to a campaign of pseudostatic cyclic tests of one-fifth scale prototype R/C bridge piers, damaged and repaired by means of a steel-tube jacketing traditional technique, or by wrapping interventions based on the use of CFRP or basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) sheets. The results attest satisfactory performance in all cases, with a significant increase in lateral stiffness and strength provided by jacketing as compared to the original response capacity, and its complete restoration in the case of the two FRP-based retrofitmeasures. The advantages of the lattermethod consist in lower physical intrusion and quicker installation times. The postprocessing study of an experimental programme carried out by the pseudodynamic method on a set of 13 R/C shear walls is presented in the article of F. J. Molina et al., where the results of the seismic tests are elaborated by an innovative strategy that allows deriving a capacity-linemodel. With this approach it is possible to understand better the different safety margins that are observed in the experiments depending on the assigned eigenfrequency in relation to the earthquake response spectra. The effects of the amount of reinforcement and normal load are also assessed. Enhanced cement composite materials are investigated in the articles by H. Choi et al. and J. Lai et al. The former deals with the experimental characterization of an innovative Portland cement mortar, prepared by incorporating multiwalled carbon nanotubes in the mixture. The experimentally measured compressive strength is greater than the one offered by standard Portland mortars, as a consequence of the bridging action of the nanotubes, which prevents the progression of microcracks and helps reducing the space between the voids in the hydration material. In J. Lay et al. ’s paper, cement fly ash gravel is examined as constituting material of pile composite foundations, for their updated use in saturated tailing dams. A finite element analysis of the settlements of this type of foundation, calibrated on the experimental investigation carried out by other authors, assesses a stable and rather homogeneous response under the design embankment loads. Three articles are dedicated to advanced seismic protection technologies. In the paper byM. Ismail et al., a numerical study of a base isolation system incorporating Roll-in-Cage devices recently developed by the authors is carried out by simulating its incorporation in a three-span prestressed R/C box girder-type bridge. The results show a remarkable global performance of the system, also in comparison with other seismic isolation solutions, highlighting its benefits in the potential application to bridge structures. The article of F. Mazza and A. Vulcano reports a shaking table testing programme developed on a one-third scale base-isolated steel frame structure equipped with an in-parallel combination of steel-PTFE sliders and elastomeric bearings (HDRBs). The experimental response confirms the high level of protection offered by the isolation technology and establishes a database for a refined numericalmodelling of the constituting devices. J. W. Hu and M. -H. Noh present a study on selfcentering friction dissipative steel braces including special components fabricated with shape-memory alloy wires and friction-type dampers. A numerical investigation carried out on single-degree-of-freedom models allows formulating a design methodology aimed at mutually optimising the recentering and energy dissipation capacities of the passive protection system, with a view to its practical implementation. Two more papers deal with the application of innovative FRP composite materials in various fields of engineering. N. B. Baba et al. examine the mechanical and physical behaviour of a hybrid glass FRP (GFRP) fabricated with three different types of glass fibers— 3 D, woven, and chopped— combined with a mixture of polyester resin and hardener. Fiber arrangement and volume are varied to evaluate the combination capable of providing the best performance in terms of tensile strength and water absorption, which is identified by means of the characterisation test developed in the study. In the article by M. E. Tas¸delen et al. the torsional behaviour of novel braided <b>sleeve</b> <b>composite</b> shafts consisting of carbon and glass fibers is investigated. Vacuum assisted resin transfer molding and vacuum bagging are adopted as manufacturing methods. The results of the experimental programme and the relevant finite element simulations underline that, for the same configuration of layup sequences, the highest torque and tensile strengths are obtained for test specimens manufactured with the former method. Furthermore, hybrid carbon-glass solutions strike the best balance between strength performance and costs. Special issues are dealt with in the remaining three articles. By considering the growing applications of piezoelectric structures in innovative technical areas, L. M. Zhou et al. implement a mixed cell-based smoothed/extended finite element method for a careful electromechanical crack analysis of the constituting material. The case study examples presented in the paper show that this mixed method is more accurate and quickly converging than a standard finite element calculation, also bypassing the mapping process inherent to the latter, which significantly increases the complexity of the calculation. J. Chen et al. report an on-site experimental study of the cooling effect of crushed rock-based embankments on slope wetlands situated along a railway line. A monitoring system installed in an embankment of notable dimensions allows reconstructing the temperature fields and the freezing Advances in Materials Science and Engineering 3 history with time. The surveyed data show that only the embankment shady side can be effectively cooled down in a warm permafrost region, and the crushed rock-based embankment can cool the entire embankment in a cold permafrost region. Finally, in the paper by Y. Ou et al. an innovative self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) process to prepare amorphous boron powder, which is an attractive material in several enhanced engineering applications, is discussed. The new technique proposed in this study consists in combining the SHS process and the traditional magnesium thermal reduction method. The effectiveness of the resulting technique suggests its possible industrial application and adoption as a common approach to prepare various inorganic materials. JRC.
