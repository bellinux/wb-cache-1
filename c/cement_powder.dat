25|$|Bags {{of cement}} {{routinely}} have {{health and safety}} warnings printed on them because not only is cement highly alkaline, but the setting process is exothermic. As a result, wet cement is strongly caustic (water pH = 13.5) and can easily cause severe skin burns if not promptly washed off with water. Similarly, dry <b>cement</b> <b>powder</b> in contact with mucous membranes can cause severe eye or respiratory irritation. Some trace elements, such as chromium, from impurities naturally present in the raw materials used to produce cement may cause allergic dermatitis. Reducing agents such as ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) are often added to cement to convert the carcinogenic hexavalent chromate (CrO42−) into trivalent chromium (Cr3+), a less toxic chemical species. Cement users need also to wear appropriate gloves and protective clothing.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve the}} desired setting qualities in the {{finished}} product, a quantity (2–8%, but typically 5%) of calcium sulfate (usually gypsum or anhydrite) {{is added to the}} clinker, and the mixture is finely ground to form the finished <b>cement</b> <b>powder.</b> This is achieved in a cement mill. The grinding process is controlled to obtain a powder with a broad particle size range, in which typically 15% by mass consists of particles below 5 μm diameter, and 5% of particles above 45 μm. The measure of fineness usually used is the 'specific surface area', which is the total particle surface area of a unit mass of cement. The rate of initial reaction (up to 24 hours) of the cement on addition of water is directly proportional to the specific surface area. Typical values are 320–380m2·kg−1 for general purpose cements, and 450–650m2·kg−1 for 'rapid hardening' cements. The cement is conveyed by belt or powder pump to a silo for storage. Cement plants normally have sufficient silo space for one to 20 weeks of production, depending upon local demand cycles. The cement is delivered to end users either in bags, or as bulk powder blown from a pressure vehicle into the customer's silo. In industrial countries, 80% or more of cement is delivered in bulk.|$|E

50|$|There are {{different}} types of cement silos such as the low-level mobile silo and the static upright cement silo, which are used to hold and discharge <b>cement</b> and other <b>powder</b> materials such as PFA (Pulverised Fuel Ash). The low-level silos are fully mobile with capacities from 100 to 750 tons. They are simple to transport and are easy to set up on site. These mobile silos generally come equipped with an electronic weighing system with digital display and printer. This allows any quantity of <b>cement</b> or <b>powder</b> discharged from the silo to be controlled and also provides an accurate indication of what remains inside the silo. The static upright silos have capacities from 200 to 800 tons.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{stabilizing}} effects {{of three different}} materials, namely: rice husk ash, <b>powdered</b> glass, and <b>cement</b> on the properties of lateritic soil. The basic properties of the lateritic soil were first obtained through colour, moisture content determination, specific gravity, particle size distribution and Atterberg limits tests. Each of the stabilizing materials was then mixed with the lateritic soil in varying percentages of 2. 5 %, 5 %, 7. 5 %, 10 %, 12. 5 % and 15 % by weight of the soil. Thereafter, compaction and California bearing ratio (CBR) tests were carried out on the sample mixes {{to determine the effects}} of the materials on the lateritic soil. Chemical tests were also carried out on the samples to determine their percentage oxides composition. The compaction test showed that the highest maximum dry densities (MDD) obtained for the mixed samples were 2. 32 g/cm 3 (at 2. 5 % cement addition), 2. 28 g/cm 3 (at 5 % powdered glass (PG) addition) and 2. 18 g/cm 3 (at 5 % rice husk ash (RHA) addition) with corresponding optimum moisture contents (OMC) of 10. 06 %, 14. 3 % and 12. 31 % respectively.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} mechanical behaviour for the Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) and UltraHigh Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC). UHPC and UHPFRC {{are designed to}} be self-consolidated concrete that level itself without mechanical vibration due to its highly flowability and moderate viscosity. UHPFRC is used as joint-fill cementitious materials for the connections of prefabricated bride elements and systems used for the Accelerated Bridge Construction and rapid bridge replacement. The main concrete constituents of such materials consist from: binders (<b>cement),</b> <b>powders</b> (fillers), liquids (additives), water, and fibers. Hence, the mixture proportion design should follow a densified mixture design algorithm to densify the particle packing that reduces the amount of pores and reduces the water/binder ratio to attain the design criteria. The concrete mix design has two approaches, namely: classical mixture including the response surface methodology and factorial-based central composite design, also known as the mathematically independent variable. Experimental work is conducted to determine the optimum particle size distribution and to identify the chemical effects followed by parametric experimental tests on different concrete constituents to develop series of UHPC/UHPFRC products and monitor there rheological behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of calcium phosphate cements are influenced both by presence of setting aids in cement paste {{and also by}} surface properties and particle size distribution of solid phase. In this study the influence of a-tricalcium phosphate powder preparation methods on {{properties of}} cement are examined: milling, thermal treatment at temperatures up to 600 °C and treatment with deionized water. The properties of cements based on prepared powders evaluated are: setting time, injectability and cohesion. The compressive strength of selected cement samples was determined. Thermal treatment improves injectability, but significantly prolongs setting time and reduces cohesiveness. Treatment of powder particles with deionized water increases setting time, but also significantly reduces injectability. It {{was not possible to}} significantly increase powder liquid ratio (from 1. 75 to 2. 00), if thermally treated powders were used. It was found that reduction of particle size, under certain conditions, can increase the injectability of <b>cements.</b> <b>Powder</b> preparation methods do not significantly affect the compression strength of cement, but fast setting upon the contact water based fluids is necessary to obtain cohesive cements. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|R
