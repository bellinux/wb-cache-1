5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The <b>central</b> <b>exchange</b> rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

25|$|With {{the next}} {{generation}} of Finnish-Americans speaking primarily English, the Central Wholesale began to Americanize from the decade of the 1930s, a trend made plain by the organization's hiring {{for the first time in}} 1930 of a field organizer who did not speak Finnish.

25|$|The <b>central</b> <b>exchange,</b> {{due to the}} system's design, {{is almost}} always a {{single point of failure}} for local calls. As the {{capacity}} of individual switches and the optical fibre which interconnects them increases, potential disruption caused by destruction of one local office will only be magnified. Multiple fibre connections can be used to provide redundancy to voice and data connections between switching centres, but careful network design is required to avoid situations where a main fibre and its backup both go through the same damaged central office as a potential common mode failure.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to offering its affiliated member-stores reduced wholesale prices generated from economies of scale, the Co-operative <b>Central</b> <b>Exchange</b> conducted educational activities aimed at making retail stores more successful. These included a training school for store managers, established in 1918, {{and the introduction}} of a simple and efficient system of bookkeeping for cooperative stores developed by H.V. Nurmi. The CCE also campaigned against the practice of stores selling on credit — a risky practice which tended to create cash flow problems and to accentuate the effect of periodic economic downturns.|$|E

Contrary to most settings in the literature where agents have the same preference, e. g. in the facility location games all agents would like {{to stay close to}} (or away from) the facility, we demonstrate the limitation of mechanism design without payments when agents have different preferences by introducing exchanging phases. We consider two types of exchanging phases. The first model is called <b>central</b> <b>exchanges</b> where the exchanges are performed by a central authority. The other model is called individual exchanges where agents exchange their outcomes by themselves. By using facility location games as an example, we provide a truthful mechanism that optimizes social welfare in <b>central</b> <b>exchanges.</b> We also provide a universally truthful randomized mechanism that achieves at least a half of the optimal social welfare in individual exchanges...|$|R

The idea for a central coordinating agency to unit the existing network of cooperative stores in the Upper Midwest of the United States had been brewing for several years, based upon a desire to buy commonly sold goods more cheaply if purchased in bulk. Also driving the cooperatives to action was discriminatory credit practices practiced by the largest regional grocery and hard goods wholesaler, who restricted the extension of credit to the cooperatives {{at the behest of the}} privately-owned retailers who were competing with them. The magazine Pelto ja Koti (Farm and Home) was instrumental in coordinating the launch of the central cooperative initiative.|$|E

2500|$|Present-day Newcastle owes {{much of its}} {{architecture}} to {{the work}} of the builder Richard Grainger, aided by [...] architects John Dobson, Thomas Oliver, John and Benjamin Green and others. [...] In 1834 Grainger won a competition to produce a new plan for central Newcastle. He put this plan into effect using the above architects as well as architects employed in his own office. Grainger and Oliver [...] had already built Leazes Terrace, Leazes Crescent and Leazes Place between 1829 and 1834. Grainger and Dobson had also built the Royal Arcade at the foot of Pilgrim Street between 1830 and 1832. The most ambitious project covered 12 acres [...] in central Newcastle, on the site of Newe House (also called Anderson Place). [...] Grainger built three new thoroughfares, Grey Street, Grainger Street and Clayton Street with many connecting streets, as well as the <b>Central</b> <b>Exchange</b> and the Grainger Market. John Wardle and George Walker, working in Grainger's [...] office, designed [...] Clayton Street, Grainger Street and most of Grey Street. Dobson designed the Grainger Market and much of the east side of Grey Street. John and Benjamin Green designed the Theatre Royal at the top of Grey Street, where Grainger placed the column of Grey’s Monument as a focus for the whole scheme. Grey Street is considered {{to be one of the}} finest streets in the country, with its elegant curve. Unfortunately most of old Eldon Square was demolished in the 1960s in the name of progress.
