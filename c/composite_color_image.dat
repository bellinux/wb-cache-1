40|$|The use {{of color}} in image {{processing}} is motivated by two principal factors; First color is a powerful descriptor that often simplifies object identification and extraction from a scene. Second, human can discern thousands of color shades and intensities, compared to about only two dozen shades of gray. In RGB model, each color appears in its primary spectral components of red, green and blue. This model is based on Cartesian coordinate system. Images represented in RGB color model consist of three component images. One for each primary, when fed into an RGB monitor, these three images combines on the phosphor screen to produce a <b>composite</b> <b>color</b> <b>image.</b> The number of bits used to represent each pixel in RGB space is called the pixel depth. Consider an RGB image in which each of the red, green and blue images is an 8 -bit image. Under these conditions each RGB color pixel {{is said to have}} a depth of 24 bit.

40|$|In recent years, PM 2. 5 air {{pollution}} {{is a social}} and transboundary environmental issue with the rapid economic growth in many countries. As PM 2. 5 is small and includes various ingredients (e. g., sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide, vitriol, nitrate salt, soot, etc.), the detection of PM 2. 5 {{air pollution}}s by using satellite data is difficult compared with the detection of dust and sandstorms (DSS). DSS can be detected by using AVI method and YDI method. AVI (Aerosol Vapor Index) is defined as AVI=T 12 -T 11, where T 12 and T 11 are the brightness temperatures at 12 μm and 11 μm wave lengths, respectively. For MODIS data, T 12 and T 11 correspond to band 32 and band 31, respectively. YDI (Yellow Dust Index) is defined as YDI=(band 4 -band 3) /(band 4 +band 3). AVI and YDI methods detect PM 2. 5 air pollutions only a little. In this paper, we examine various RGB composite color images for detecting PM 2. 5 air pollutions by using MODIS data, i. e., {R, G, B = band 4, band 3, T 11 }, {R, G, B = band 10, band 9, T 11 }, {R, G, B = band 9, band 8, T 11 }, {R, G, B = AVI, band 7 -band 1, T 11 }, {R, G, B = AVI, band 10 -band 9, T 11 }, etc. A good method {{for the detection of}} PM 2. 5 air pollution is {R, G, B = band 10, band 9, T 11 }. In this <b>composite</b> <b>color</b> <b>image,</b> PM 2. 5 air pollutions are represented by light purple or pink color. This proposed method is applied to the detection of PM 2. 5 air pollutions in the wide area from China and India to Japan by using MODIS data on 12 January 2013, and AVI method is applied to DSS detection in the same area. By comparing the AVI image with the image by the proposed method, PM 2. 5 air pollutions can be distinguished from DSS. The proposed method is simpler than the method by Nagatani et al.

The only completely reliable method to demonstrate the shock origin of suspected (sub-) planar microstructures, transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations, is costly and time consuming. We have used a cathodoluminescence (CL) detector attached to a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to image both PDFs and tectonic deformation lamellae in quartz to demonstrate the potential of a simple method to identify PDFs and define characteristics that allow their distinction from tectonic deformation lamellae. In both limited wavelength grayscale and <b>composite</b> <b>color</b> SEM-CL <b>images,</b> PDFs are easily identified. They are straight, narrow, well-defined features, whereas tectonic deformation lamellae are thicker, slightly curved, and there is often no clear boundary between lamella and host quartz. <b>Composite</b> <b>color</b> <b>images</b> reveal two types of CL behavior in PDFs: either they emit a red to infrared CL signal or they are nonluminescent. The color of the CL signal emitted by tectonic deformation lamellae ranges from blue to red. For comparison, we also imaged several shocked quartz grains at cryogenic temperature. In most cases, the PDF characteristics in cryo-CL images do not differ significantly from those in images recorded at room temperature. We conclude that SEM-CL imaging, especially when <b>color</b> <b>composites</b> are used, provides a promising, practical, low cost, and nondestructive method to distinguish between PDFs and tectonic lamellae, even when the simplest CL techniques available are used...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{demonstrate}} the value of ERTS- 1 data as a supplement to mineral reconnaissance techniques. Field studies have revealed that the major mining districts in Lander and Eureka counties, Nevada, tend to be aligned in northwest-southeast belts with ore deposits occurring in carbonates which have been exposed by domal windows through the upper plate of the Roberts Mountain thrust. Analyses of <b>composite</b> <b>color</b> <b>images</b> of ERTS- 1 data obtained from a digital image-editing system indicated that many of the ore districts are related to lineaments not previously mapped either by aerial or field studies. These lineaments very likely indicate deep zones of structural weakness along which igneous rocks and related ore-bearing fluids have penetrated. An isolineament intersection map prepared from the imagery displays a concentrated band of lineament intersections that coincides with the previously mapped mineral belts. Within that band, a strong correlation exists between areas of intersection concentration and domal windows associated with major districts. Based on this correlation, two major intersection concentration areas which have no known associated ore deposits are interpreted to be buried domal areas and potential exploration targets...|$|R

PDFs can be identified in scanning electron microscope cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) images, but not all PDFs show the same CL behavior: there are nonluminescent and red luminescent PDFs.

Focused ion beam (FIB) thin foils were prepared of specific sample locations selected in <b>composite</b> <b>color</b> SEM-CL <b>images</b> and were analyzed in a transmission electron microscope (TEM).

Fewer strong sandstorms occurred in the places of origin in 2005, mainly because of the snow cover with moderate high and low pressure systems in the place of dust origin. The weather patterns explain why there were fewer dustfall episodes in Korea in 2005 than in the period between 1997 and 2004. A total of seven dustfall episodes were monitored in Korea in 2005 and they covered a period of 11 days. In the summer of 2005, sandstorms occurred less frequently in the source region due to high humidity and weaker winds; as a result, there were no dustfall episodes in Korea.

Hence, the interpretation of SAR images {{is considered to be}} more challenging compared to the analysis of optical data. However, in this paper, we demonstrate how information on the local development of speckle can be used for the differentiation of basic land cover (LC) types in a single-polarized SAR image. For that purpose, we specify the speckle characteristics of the following LC types: 1) water; 2) open land (farmland, grassland, bare soil); 3) woodland; and 4) urban area by means of an unsupervised analysis of scatter plots and standardized histograms of the local coefficient of variation. Next, we use this information for the implementation of a straightforward preclassification of single-polarized TerraSAR-X stripmap images by combining information on the local speckle behavior and local backscatter intensity. The output is either provided as a discrete classification or as a <b>color</b> <b>composite</b> <b>image</b> whose bands can be interpreted in terms of a fuzzy classification. The results of this paper show that unsupervised speckle analysis in high-resolution SAR images supplies valuable information for a differentiation of the water, open land, woodland, and urban area LC types. While the <b>color</b> <b>composite</b> <b>image</b> supports the visual interpretation of SAR data, the outcome of the fully automated discrete LC classification procedure represents a valuable preclassification image, showing overall accuracies of 77...|$|R
