25|$|Unrest among wheat farmers, {{especially}} among Norwegian immigrants, {{led to a}} populist political movement centered in the Non Partisan League ("NPL") {{around the time of}} World War I, during which it ran candidates on the Republican ticket (yet merging into the Democratic Party after World War II). It tried to insulate North Dakota from the power of out-of-state banks and corporations. In addition to founding the state-owned Bank of North Dakota and North Dakota Mill and Elevator (both still in existence), the NPL established a state-owned railroad line (later sold to the Soo Line Railroad). Anti-corporate laws virtually prohibited a corporation or bank from owning title to land zoned as farmland. These laws, still in force today, after having been upheld by state and federal courts, make it almost impossible to foreclose on farmland, as even after foreclosure, the property title cannot be held by a bank or mortgage company. Furthermore, the Bank of North Dakota, having powers similar to a Federal Reserve branch bank, exercised its power to limit the issuance of subprime mortgages and their <b>collateralization</b> in the form of derivative instruments, and so prevented a collapse of housing prices within the state in the wake of 2008's financial crisis.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, ischemic colitis is a well-recognized {{complication}} of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, when {{the origin of}} the inferior mesenteric artery is covered by the aortic graft. [...] In a 1991 review concerning 2137 patients the accidental inferior mesenteric artery ligation was the most common cause (74%) of ischemic colitis. Thus, patients without adequate <b>collateralization</b> are at risk for ischemia of the descending and sigmoid colon. [...] Bloody diarrhea and leukocytosis in the postoperative period are essentially diagnostic of ischemic colitis. The complication can be prevented through careful selection of subjects that may require replanting inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and completing the pre surgical procedure information with an instrumental evaluation during surgical treatment.|$|E
2500|$|In larger transactions, {{sometimes}} {{all or part}} of these two debt types is replaced by high yield bonds. Depending {{on the size of the}} acquisition, debt as well as equity can be provided by more than one party. In larger transactions, debt is often syndicated, meaning that the bank who arranges the credit sells {{all or part of}} the debt in pieces to other banks in an attempt to diversify and hence reduce its risk. Another form of debt that is used in LBOs are seller notes (or vendor loans) in which the seller effectively uses parts of the proceeds of the sale to grant a loan to the purchaser. Such seller notes are often employed in management buyouts or in situations with very restrictive bank financing environments. Note that in close to all cases of LBOs, the only <b>collateralization</b> available for the debt are the assets and cash flows of the company. The financial sponsor can treat their investment as common equity or preferred equity among other types of securities. [...] Preferred equity can pay a dividend and has payment preferences to common equity.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, <b>collateralization,</b> also vessel <b>collateralization</b> {{and blood}} vessel <b>collateralization,</b> is {{the growth of}} a blood vessel or several blood vessels that serve the same end organ or {{vascular}} bed as another blood vessel that cannot adequately supply that end organ or vascular bed sufficiently.|$|E

50|$|Collateral, {{especially}} within banking, traditionally {{refers to}} secured lending (also known as asset-based lending). More-complex <b>collateralization</b> arrangements {{may be used}} to secure trade transactions (also known as capital market <b>collateralization).</b> The former often presents unilateral obligations secured in the form of property, surety, guarantee or other collateral (originally denoted by the term security), whereas the latter often presents bilateral obligations secured by more-liquid assets such as cash or securities, often known as margin.|$|E

50|$|Coronary <b>{{collateral}}ization</b> exists latently in {{the normal}} heart. Microscopic collateral vessels of the heart undergo a process called transformation that widens the vessel lumen {{at the expense of}} its cell wall in response to myocardial stresses—specifically, myocardial spasm and hypoxia secondary to myocardial infarction or acutely stressful exercise. The status of the coronary collaterals has also been shown to be influenced by the presence of diabetes mellitus.|$|E
50|$|While economists {{consider}} borrowing against {{home equity}} to be analogous to 'withdrawal' it is, in fact, simply <b>collateralization</b> of an asset. As an economic metric {{it is very}} useful to do so; however, this view is a balance sheet phenomenon and not actual conversion of home equity into cash. The sole means of withdrawal of home equity is the downsizing of the asset in a manner which does not result in establishing a lien against the entire asset. A lien puts the entire asset at risk; downsizing simply converts equity into cash, leaving {{the balance of the}} value of the asset intact.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>collateralization</b> - As {{mentioned}} above, {{the lender}} must receive collateral {{to ensure that}} they are adequately covered in the event of borrower default. Securities lending is very safe for lenders, since they will always receive the additional margin value above the value of the securities lent - margins range from 2-10% usually, depending upon lender risk profile and the settlement market. The collateral process differs depending on collateral method - main ones used are cash, cash pool, bilateral collateral and RQV through a triparty provider (such as Bank of New York, JP Morgan Chase, Euroclear or Clearstream).|$|E
50|$|Pete tells Lane he doesn't {{have that}} kind of money and applies for a loan of his own. When the bank phones the Campbell residence, Trudy mistakenly {{believes}} Pete wants to surprise her by buying a house in the suburbs. She and Pete argue, when Pete explains he needs the loan to fulfill his fiduciary obligation as a partner, so the firm can make payroll and reduce the number of layoffs. In response, Trudy - referring to SCDP as the Titanic and the requested <b>collateralization</b> as doubling down on a large gambling loss - forbids Pete to borrow the sum from the bank or her father.|$|E

5000|$|Cross-{{collateral}}ization is a {{term used}} when the collateral for one loan is also used as collateral for another loan. [...] If a person has borrowed from the same bank a home loan secured by the house, a car loan secured by the car, and so on, these assets {{can be used as}} cross-collaterals for all the loans. If the person pays off the car loan and wants to sell the car, the bank may veto the deal because the car is still used to secure the home loan and other loans. Technically, cross-collateralization expires when the borrower has no outstanding loans with the bank. In the context of bankruptcy, cross-collateralization also means the <b>collateralization</b> of general unsecured prepetition debt by collateral securing postpetition loans.|$|E
5000|$|Pfandbrief issuers use pfandbriefe to fund {{loans that}} are secured by real estate liens, ship or {{aircraft}} mortgages or claims against public-sector bodies. Depending {{on the type}} of <b>collateralization,</b> these bonds are referred to as Mortgage Pfandbrief (...) , Public Pfandbrief (...) , Ship Pfandbrief (...) or Aircraft Pfandbrief (...) [...] Pfandbrief issuers have three different pfandbrief segments at their disposal: Jumbo pfandbriefe, traditional pfandbriefe and registered pfandbriefe. For the actual placement issuers have the choice between private placements and public offering. With a volume outstanding of EUR 806 billion, the Pfandbrief held a leading place in the European bond markets at year-end 2008. Pfandbriefe made up 22 percent of the German bond market in 2008: 71.9 percent of pfandbriefe were public pfandbriefe, 27.0% Mortgage Pfandbriefe and 1.1% Ship Pfandbriefe. The first Aircraft Pfandbriefe were expected to be issued in 2010.|$|E
50|$|One {{significant}} {{evolution of}} the leasing industry involved the <b>collateralization</b> of lease obligations in sale leaseback transactions. For example, a city would sell an asset to a bank. The bank would require lease payments and give the city an option to repurchase the asset. The lease obligations were low enough (due to the depreciation deductions the banks were now claiming) that the city could pay for the lease obligations and fund the repurchase of the asset by depositing most {{but not all of}} the sale proceeds in an interest-bearing account. This resulted in the city having pre-funded all of its lease obligations as well as its option to repurchase the asset from the bank for less than the amount received in the initial sale of the asset, in which case the city would be left with additional cash after having pre-funded all of its lease obligations.|$|E
50|$|The {{credit channel}} view posits that {{monetary}} policy adjustments {{that affect the}} short-term interest rate are amplified by endogenous changes in the external finance premium. The external finance premium is a wedge reflecting {{the difference in the}} cost of capital internally available to firms (i.e. retaining earnings) versus firms' cost of raising capital externally via equity and debt markets. External financing is more expensive than internal financing and the external finance premium will exist so long as external financing is not fully collateralized. Fully collateralized financing implies that even under the worst-case scenario the expected payoff of the project is at least sufficient to guarantee full loan repayment. In other words, full <b>collateralization</b> means that the firm who borrows for the project has enough internal funds relative {{to the size of the}} project that the lenders assume no risk. Contractionary monetary policy is thought to increase the size of the external finance premium, and subsequently, through the credit channel, reduce credit availability in the economy.|$|E
5000|$|REMICs abolish {{many of the}} inefficiencies of collateralized {{mortgage}} obligations (CMOs) {{and offer}} issuers more options and greater flexibility. [...] REMICs have no minimum equity requirements, so REMICs can sell all of their assets rather than retain some to meet <b>collateralization</b> requirements. Since regular interests automatically qualify as debt, REMICs also avoid the awkward reinvestment risk that CMO issuers bear to indicate debt. REMICs also may make monthly distributions to investors where CMOs make quarterly payments. REMIC residual interests enjoy more liquidity than owner’s trusts, which restrict equity interest and personal liability transfers. REMICs offer more flexibility than CMOs, as issuers can choose any legal entity and type of securities. The REMIC’s multiple-class capabilities also permit issuers to offer different servicing priorities along with varying maturity dates, lowering default risks and reducing the need for credit enhancement. [...] REMICs are also fairly user-friendly, as the REMIC election is not difficult, and the extensive guidance in the Code and in the regulations offers “a high degree of certainty with respect to tax treatment {{that may not be}} available for other types of MBSs.” ...|$|E
50|$|Agricultural {{value chain}} finance is {{concerned}} with the flows of funds to and within a value chain {{to meet the needs of}} chain actors for finance, to secure sales, to buy inputs or produce, or to improve efficiency. Examining the potential for value chain finance involves a holistic approach to analyze the chain, those working in it, and their inter-linkages. These linkages allow financing to flow through the chain. For example, inputs can be provided to farmers and the cost can be repaid directly when the product is delivered, without need for farmers taking a loan from a bank or similar institution. This is common under contract farming arrangements. Types of value chain finance include product financing through trader and input supplier credit or credit supplied by a marketing company or a lead firm. Other trade finance instruments include receivables financing where the bank advances funds against an assignment of future receivables from the buyer, and factoring in which a business sells its accounts receivable at a discount. Also falling under value chain finance are asset <b>collateralization,</b> such as on the basis of warehouse receipts, and risk mitigation, such as forward contracting, futures and insurance.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>collateralization</b> through {{the change of}} funding cost is now well recognized among practitioners. In this article, we have extended the previous studies of collateralized derivative pricing to more generic situation, that is asymmetric and imperfect <b>collateralization</b> {{as well as the}} associated CVA. We have presented approximate expressions for various cases using Gateaux derivative which allow straightforward numerical analysis. Numerical examples for CCS (cross currency swap) and IRS (interest rate swap) with asymmetric <b>collateralization</b> were also provided. They clearly show the practical relevance of sophisticated collateral management for financial firms. The valuation and the associated issue of collateral cost under the one-way CSA (or unilateral <b>collateralization),</b> which is common when SSA (sovereign, supranational and agency) entities are involved, have been also studied. We have also discussed some generic implications of asymmetric <b>collateralization</b> for netting and resolution of information. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether and}} to what extent cystatin C was associated with angiographic coronary <b>collateralization</b> in patients with stable coronary artery disease and chronic total occlusion. Serum levels of cystatin C and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were determined in 866 patients with stable angina and angiographic total occlusion of at least one major coronary artery. The degree of collaterals supplying the distal aspect of a total occlusion from the contra-lateral vessel was graded as poor (Rentrop score of 0 or 1) or good coronary <b>collateralization</b> (Rentrop score of 2 or 3). In total, serum cystatin C was higher in patients with poor <b>collateralization</b> than in those with good <b>collateralization</b> (1. 08 ± 0. 32 mg/L vs. 0. 90 ± 0. 34 mg/L, P < 0. 001), and correlated inversely with Rentrop score (adjusted Spearmen's r = - 0. 145, P < 0. 001). The prevalence of poor coronary <b>collateralization</b> increased stepwise with increasing cystatin C quartiles (P for trend < 0. 001). After adjusting for age, gender, risk factors for coronary artery disease, GFR and hsCRP, serum cystatin C ≥ 0. 97 mg/L remained independently associated with poor <b>collateralization</b> (OR 2. 374, 95 % CI 1. 660 ~ 3. 396, P < 0. 001). The diagnostic value of cystatin C levels for detecting poor coronary <b>collateralization</b> persisted regardless of age, gender, presence or absence of diabetes, hypertension or renal dysfunction. Serum cystatin C reflects angiographic coronary <b>collateralization</b> in patients with stable coronary artery disease, and cystatin C ≥ 0. 97 mg/L indicates a great risk of poor coronary collaterals...|$|E
30|$|Fourthly, banks {{commonly}} apply a flat haircut to {{the collateral}} value. For collateral in real estate, this haircut ranges between 10 and 40  % in Germany (see, e.g., Grunert and Weber 2009; Bruhn 2009; Pfnür 2011). Hence, we apply flat haircuts to the collateral values {{to adjust the}} <b>collateralization</b> ratios and explain the recovery rate again. In comparison to the flat haircuts, we use predicted proceeds ratios to adjust {{the market value of}} real estate. We thereby obtain an adjusted <b>collateralization</b> ratio that {{can also be used to}} explain the recovery rate. Both adjustments of the <b>collateralization</b> ratios considerably increase the explanatory power of the original model, whereas the haircut models perform worse in terms of explanatory power in comparison to the models using model-adjusted <b>collateralization</b> ratios.|$|E
40|$|Interest rate swap pricing theory {{traditionally}} views swaps as portfolios of forward {{contracts with}} net swap payments discounted using LIBOR rates. Current market practices of marking-to-market and <b>collateralization</b> question this view. <b>Collateralization</b> and marking-to-market affects discounting of swap payments (through altered default characteristics) and introduces intermediate cash-flows. This paper provides {{a theory of}} swap valuation under <b>collateralization</b> and we find evidence that <b>collateralization</b> effects swap rates. Using Eurodollar futures, we find that swaps are priced above the portfolio of forwards value and below a portfolio of futures value. The effect of collateral is time varying.

40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} argued that {{competing}} banks make inefficiently frequent use of <b>collateralization</b> in situations where they are better able to evaluate a project's risk than entrepreneurs. We study the bank's choice between screening and <b>collateralization</b> in a model where banks do not have this superior screening skill. In particular, we study the effect of bank competition on this choice. We find that competing banks use collateral less often than a monopolistic bank because competition will intensify if both banks collateralize. Moreover, bank competition is welfare improving if <b>collateralization</b> is rather costly...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} economic significance and implications of <b>collateralization</b> in different financial markets, which is essentially a matter of theoretical justification and empirical verification. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework that allows for <b>collateralization</b> adhering to bankruptcy laws. As such, the model can back out differences in asset prices due to collateralized counterparty risk. This framework is very useful for pricing outstanding defaultable financial contracts. By using a unique data set, {{we are able to}} achieve a clean decomposition of prices into their credit risk factors. We find empirical evidence that counterparty risk is not overly important in credit-related spreads. Only the joint effects of <b>collateralization</b> and credit risk can sufficiently explain unsecured credit costs. This finding suggests that failure to properly account for <b>collateralization</b> may result in significant mispricing of financial contracts. We also analyze the difference between cleared and OTC markets. ...|$|E
