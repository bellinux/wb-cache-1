5|$|Although the {{population}} {{now appears to}} be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria.

Eradication of rats protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; this means that the problems can be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.|$|E

The one exception to this pattern in the first series is the chapter that appears in Shōnen Magazine Wonder, which uses the natural sign(♮). School Rumble Z uses the natural sign for every chapter. The manga volumes of School Rumble contain original bonus chapters that use no musical notation; these are normally one page in length, but the seventh volume spreads its bonus chapter over several pages with each page telling a self-contained story.|$|E
