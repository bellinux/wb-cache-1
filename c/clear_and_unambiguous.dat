5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles of fairness. English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers. Generally, the courts will grant {{judicial review of}} an administrative decision based on an individual's legitimate expectation if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers. The individual has {{to show that the}} representation was a <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>unambiguous</b> promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E
5|$|The new Order {{was again}} struck {{down by the}} Divisional Court and Court of Appeal before {{proceeding}} to the House of Lords where it was heard by Lords Hoffmann, Bingham, Rodger, Carswell and Mance between 30 June and 3 July 2008. In their judgment, issued on 22 October 2008, the Lords decided by a 3-2 majority to uphold the new Order in Council, stating that it was valid and, although judicial review actions could look at Orders in Council, the national security and foreign relations issues in the case barred them from doing so. In addition, Cook's statement had not been <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>unambiguous</b> enough to provide legitimate expectation.|$|E
5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>unambiguous</b> promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E

500|$|However, by a {{majority}} of 3 to 2, the Lords upheld the legality of the Constitutional Order, including Section 9. The majorityLords Hoffmann, Rodger and Carswellheld that BIOT was a [...] "conquered or ceded colony" [...] and therefore was subject to the prerogative powers of the Crown. They rejected the principle that there was a constitutional right to reside in one's own country, calling it [...] "extreme", and concluded that in any case no such right could not trump legislation such as an Order in Council. The phrase [...] "peace, order and good government", they thought, should be understood as referring not just to the inhabitants of BIOT but to the governance of the region. The wording was to be treated [...] "as apt to confer plenary lawmaking authority" [...] and reviewing the Order was a matter for the government and Parliament, not for the courts, since it was a political issue of national security and foreign relations. At the same time, no legitimate expectation had been created following Bancoult (No 1). The standard requirement for legitimate expectation, as decided in R v North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan, was that there must be a [...] "clear and unambiguous" [...] promise made that led to a reliance or a detriment; Robin Cook's statement after the first Bancoult case could not be described as a <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>unambiguous</b> promise of resettlement, and the requirements of reliance and detriment were not met.|$|E

2500|$|Although it is {{generally}} accepted that EU law has primacy, not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims: that is, not all EU laws have [...] "direct effect". In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that {{the provisions of the}} Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>unambiguous</b> (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not [...] "expressly" [...] confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed [...] "the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are 'directly applicable in all Member States'. Member states come under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. [...] "Regulations", held the Court of Justice, [...] "come into force solely by virtue of their publication" [...] and implementation could have the effect of [...] "jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union". On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed.|$|E
6000|$|If Mr. Sheldon's {{critics were}} unfair his {{defenders}} were, as a rule, not much better. They {{meant to be}} fair, {{but they had to}} be foolish. For example, there is the Rev. Dr. Parkhurst, whose defence was published with Mr. Harvey's attack. I shall give a single illustration of how this more celebrated than cerebrated [...] "divine" [...] is pleased to think that he thinks. He is replying to some one's application to this matter of Christ's injunction, [...] "Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth." [...] This command, he gravely says, [...] "is not against money, nor against the making of money, but against the loving it for its own sake and the dedicating of it to self-aggrandizing uses." [...] I call this a foolish utterance, because it violates the good old rule of not telling an obvious falsehood. In no word nor syllable does Christ's injunction give the least color of truth to the reverend gentleman's [...] "interpretation;" [...] that is the reverend gentleman's very own, and doubtless he feels an honest pride in it.

Moreover, they are consistent with all that we think we know of their author's life and character, for he not only lived in poverty and taught poverty as a blessing, but commanded it as a duty and a means of salvation. The probable effect of universal obedience among those who adore him as a god is not at present an urgent question. I think even so faithful a disciple as the Rev. Dr. Parkhurst has still a place to lay his head, a little of the wherewithal to be clothed, and a good deal of the power of interpretation to excuse it.|$|E
