40|$|Graduation date: 1991 It {{has become}} {{customary}} {{in electrical engineering}} to think of signal processing in terms of voltage variables {{to the exclusion of}} current variables. This tendency has resulted in voltage signal processing circuits such as voltage-controlled voltage sources (VCVS) and voltage-mode operational amplifiers. However, the VCVS operational amplifier has several limitations which prevent high performance operation. One of these limitations is that the product of the closed loop - 3 dB bandwidth and the closed loop voltage gain is approximately a constant. Thus, for a typical internally <b>compensated</b> <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier</b> the closed loop - 3 dB bandwidth decreases as the closed loop voltage gain increases. By taking advantage of a current-controlled current source (CCCS) to form a current-mode operational amplifier, this limitation can be overcome...|$|E
