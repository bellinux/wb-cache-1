25|$|City Bank of New York was {{chartered}} by New York State on June 16, 1812, with $2million of capital. Serving a {{group of}} New York merchants, the bank opened for business on September 14 of that year, and Samuel Osgood was elected as the first President of the company. The company's name was changed to The National City Bank of New York in 1865 after it joined the new U.S. national banking system, and it became the largest American bank by 1895. It became the first contributor to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1913, and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a U.S. bank in Buenos Aires, although the bank had, since the mid-19th century, been active in plantation economies, such as the Cuban sugar industry. The 1918 purchase of U.S. overseas bank International Banking Corporation helped it become the first American bank to surpass $1 billion in assets, and it became the largest commercial bank {{in the world in}} 1929. As it grew, the bank became a leading innovator in financial services, becoming the first major U.S. bank to offer compound interest on savings (1921); unsecured personal loans (1928); customer checking accounts (1936) and the negotiable <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposit</b> (1961).|$|E
2500|$|Deposit brokers, {{somewhat}} like stockbrokers, are paid a commission by the customer {{to find the}} best <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposit</b> (CD) rates and place their customers' money in those CDs. Previously, banks and thrifts could only have five percent of their deposits be brokered deposits; the race to the bottom caused this limit to be lifted. A small one-branch thrift could then attract a large number of deposits simply by offering the highest rate. To make money off this expensive money, it had to lend at even higher rates, meaning that it had to make more, riskier investments. This system was made even more damaging when certain deposit brokers instituted a scam known as [...] "linked financing". In [...] "linked financing", a deposit broker would approach a thrift and say he would steer a large amount of deposits to that thrift if the thrift would lend certain people money. The people, however, were paid a fee to apply for the loans and told to give the loan proceeds to the deposit broker.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{money market}} mutual fund {{to break the}} buck was First Multifund for Daily Income (FMDI) in 1978, liquidating and restating NAV at 94 cents per share. [...] An {{argument}} has been made that FMDI was not technically a money market fund as at the time of liquidation the average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two years. [...] However, prospective investors were informed that FMDI would invest [...] "solely in Short-Term (30-90 days) MONEY MARKET obligations." [...] Furthermore, the rule restricting which the maturities which money market funds are permitted to invest in, Rule 2-a7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, was not promulgated until 1983. Prior to the adoption of this rule, a mutual fund had to do little other than present itself as a money market fund, which FMDI did. [...] Seeking higher yield, FMDI had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities, and rising interest rates negatively impacted the value of its portfolio. [...] In order to meet increasing redemptions, the fund was forced to sell a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposit</b> at a 3% loss, triggering a restatement of its NAV and the first instance of a money market fund [...] "breaking the buck".|$|E
