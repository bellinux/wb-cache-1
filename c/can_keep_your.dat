500|$|Early on, Young {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On {{the last day of the}} season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young's career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager Gus Schmelz, [...] "He's too green to do your club much good, but I believe if I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He's not worth it now, but I'm willing to give you $1,000 ($ today) for him." [...] Schmelz replied, [...] "Cap, you <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> thousand and we'll keep the rube." ...|$|E
500|$|Released to {{positive}} reviews, with aggregated scores of 87/100 on Metacritic and 88.7% on GameRankings, some journalists considered Super Monkey Ball {{the highlight of}} the GameCube's launch lineup. The staff of Edge praised the main game as [...] "absorb" [...] due to its high level of difficulty, noting that the trial and error required to complete challenging levels forces one to learn the nuances of its [...] "reductive control system" [...] and eventually enables the player to perform seemingly impossible tasks with increasing ease: [...] "Once a level falls, the mysticism around it vanishes. It's beatable; it's an afterthought on the route to your next impossible hurdle." [...] Writing for GameSpy, Ben Turner commented on the [...] "excellent progression of difficulty" [...] engendered by three distinct difficulty modes and thoughtful stage design, expounding [...] "most levels introduce some new idea or concept to the game" [...] and [...] "every single level played adds to your skill." [...] IGN's Matt Casamassina commended the [...] "great level variation", with [...] "well created mazes and puzzles that must be completed using a combination of physics calculations, careful planning and a huge helping of patience." [...] Turner complimented the frequent introduction of incentives to keep playing such as additional continues and hidden levels, adding that a high [...] "ceiling of mastery" [...] enhanced the game's longevity through a [...] "simple but well conceived" [...] scoring system and the ability to test strategies in practice mode. Edge and Casamassina thought similarly, with the latter stating [...] "there are shortcuts that can be carved out by the crafty player, physics to be considered when navigating and more." [...] N-Sider's Tim Knowles pointed out that [...] "the latter levels in the game get extremely difficult and you will often get frustrated", while Casamassina felt [...] "it may be a little too difficult for the casual gamer." [...] However, N-Sider's Mark Medina called the learning curve [...] "perfectly spot on": [...] "Any falling off the platforms feels entirely your fault and at the same time, you always get the sense that you're just that little bit closer to that elusive goal." [...] Edge and N-Sider's Jason Nuyens and Will Stevenson agreed with this sentiment, with the latter emphasizing the addictive quality of the gameplay. On a technical note, GamePros Four-Eyed Dragon faulted the camera system, which [...] "can get out of position, making it hard to maneuver in tight spots." [...] In The Japan Times, Steven L. Kent described the game as [...] "a test of nerve" [...] requiring [...] "advanced eye–hand coordination." [...] Turner reflected on the game's ability to evoke feelings of [...] "nervous excitement", [...] "intensity", and [...] "electrifying, stomach-wrenching fear": [...] "It's a thrilling feeling to be winding down a paper-thin path with ten seconds on the clock, hoping against hope that you <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> balance for just a few more seconds and make it to the goal before time expires." [...] Edge opined that the game is [...] "defined" [...] by [...] "unrefined and angular" [...] emotions: ...|$|E

2500|$|Another way to {{understand}} {{the solution is to}} consider the two original unchosen doors together (Adams 1990; Devlin 2003, 2005; Williams 2004; Stibel et al., 2008). As Cecil Adams puts it (Adams 1990), [...] "Monty is saying in effect: you <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> one door or you can have the other two doors." [...] The [...] chance of finding the car has not been changed by the opening of one of these doors because Monty, knowing the location of the car, is certain to reveal a goat. So the player's choice after the host opens a door is no different than if the host offered the player the option to switch from the original chosen door to the set of both remaining doors. The switch in this case clearly gives the player a [...] probability of choosing the car.|$|E
2500|$|Jesus Freak Hideout's Kevin Hoskins {{said that}} the band [...] "continues to rock stages year after year. I feel like I say that with every release, which is {{impressive}} since they've been around {{for almost two decades}} now. So, what's one to expect from 'O God Help Us All?' Exactly the same Disciple as always: some solid hard rock tunes mixed with a healthy dose of ballads. Though it may not carry the lyrical depth or stellar musical creativity of other acts, it <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> head bobbing all day long." [...] Hoskins wrote that [...] "In the end, this is what Disciple is known for. Is it going to be played all over Christian rock stations? Absolutely. But will it be the most mind-blowing album you've heard this year? Definitely not. Fans of Disciple will not be disappointed, but I don't except the band to garner any new attention with this release." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 1990, {{an equally}} {{contentious}} discussion of vos Savant's article {{took place in}} Cecil Adams's column The Straight Dope (Adams 1990). Adams initially answered, incorrectly, that the chances for the two remaining doors must each be one in two. After a reader wrote in to correct the mathematics of Adams's analysis, Adams agreed that mathematically he had been wrong. [...] "You pick door #1. Now you're offered this choice: open door #1, or open door #2 and door #3. In the latter case you keep the prize if it's behind either door. You'd rather have a two-in-three shot at the prize than one-in-three, wouldn't you? If you think about it, the original problem offers you basically the same choice. Monty is saying in effect: you <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> one door or {{you can have the}} other two doors, one of which (a non-prize door) I'll open for you." [...] Adams did say the Parade version left critical constraints unstated, and without those constraints, the chances of winning by switching were not necessarily two out of three (e.g., it was not reasonable to assume the host always opens a door). Numerous readers, however, wrote in to claim that Adams had been [...] "right the first time" [...] and that the correct chances were one in two.|$|E
