The surface roughness prediction model is proposed by utilizing the response surface analysis with the Box-Behnken design. <b>The</b> effects of <b>cutting</b> parameters on <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> force and <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> temperature are investigated. <b>The</b> <b>cutting</b> force and <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> temperature are measured to help analyze the relation between the surface roughness and <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> conditions. <b>The</b> models of <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> force ratio and <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> temperature are also proposed based on the experimental data.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a predictive cutting force model in drilling of anisotropic materials. Three dimensional chip flow in drilling is {{interpreted as a}} piling up of <b>the</b> orthogonal <b>cuttings</b> in <b>the</b> planes containing <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> velocities and <b>the</b> chip flow velocities. <b>The</b> <b>cutting</b> models in <b>the</b> chip flow are determined to calculate <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> energy using <b>the</b> orthogonal <b>cutting</b> data. Then, <b>the</b> chip flow direction is determined to minimize <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> energy. <b>The</b> <b>cutting</b> force can be predicted in the determined chip flow model. <b>The</b> <b>cutting</b> force with anisotropy in the material is modeled as {{the change in the}} shear stress on the shear plane. The shear stress changes with the edge orientation angle. <b>The</b> <b>cutting</b> force prediction is verified in drilling of a titanium alloy. The anisotropic parameters are identified to minimize the model error between the measured and <b>the</b> predicted <b>cutting</b> forces. <b>The</b> periodical oscillation of <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> force is also predicted by anisotropy in the shear stress...|$|R

The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{based on}} finite element {{software}} DEFORM, {{the model of}} a large cutting depth and quasi-high speeds milling of titanium alloys is built to study <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> temperature and cutting force variation along with <b>the</b> change of <b>cutting</b> parameters. <b>The</b> simulation results show that: the location of <b>the</b> maximum <b>cutting</b> temperature appears in <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> edges of <b>the</b> tool nose circular profile. Meanwhile, due to workpiece material rebound in <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> process, <b>the</b> interface between workpiece and tool flank face occurs serious extrusion, which results in relatively high <b>cutting</b> temperature on <b>the</b> workpiece machined surface.

With the increase in the feed rate and cutting depth, cutting force increased significantly.

The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry.
