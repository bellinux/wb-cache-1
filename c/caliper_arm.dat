50|$|Density-neutron logs {{read the}} {{formation}} within about four to seven inches (178 mm) of the borehole wall. This {{is an advantage}} in resolving thin beds. It is a disadvantage when the hole is badly caved. Corrections can be made automatically if the cave {{is no more than}} a few inches deep. A <b>caliper</b> <b>arm</b> on the sonde measures the profile of the borehole and a correction is calculated and incorporated in the porosity reading. However, if the cave is much more than four inches deep, the density-neutron log is reading little more than drilling mud.|$|E
50|$|Density tools use {{gamma ray}} {{radiation}} {{to determine the}} lithology and density of the rock in the downhole environment. Modern density tools utilize a Cs-137 radioactive source to generate gamma rays which interact with the rock strata. Since higher density materials absorb gamma rays much better than lower density materials, a gamma ray detector in the wire line tool is able to accurately determine formation density by measuring the number and associated energy level of returning gamma rays that have interacted with the rock matrix. Density tools usually incorporate an extendable <b>caliper</b> <b>arm,</b> which is used both to press the radioactive source and detectors {{against the side of}} the bore and also to measure the exact width of the bore in order to remove the effect of varying bore diameter on the readings.|$|E
40|$|During Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 311 five {{boreholes}} were drilled {{across the}} accretionary prism {{of the northern}} Cascadia subduction zone. Logging-while-drilling borehole images are utilized to determine breakout orientations to define maximum horizontal compressive stress orientations. Additionally, wireline logging data at two of these sites and from Site 889 of Ocean Drilling Program Leg 146 are used to define breakouts from differences in the aperture of <b>caliper</b> <b>arms.</b> At most sites, the maximum horizontal compressive stress SHmax is margin-normal, consistent with plate convergence. Deviations from this trend reflect local structural perturbations. Our results do not constrain stress magnitudes. If the margin-normal compressional stress {{is greater than the}} vertical stress, the margin-normal SHmax direction we observe may reflect current locking of a velocity-weakening shallow megathrust and thus potential for trench-breaching, tsunamigenic rupture in a future megathrust earthquake...|$|R
30|$|Anthropometric {{methods such as}} skin fold {{thickness}} by <b>caliper</b> measurement, mid <b>arm</b> and calf circumferences {{have been}} used to assess muscle mass. However, these methods are prone to measurement error with significant interobserver variability and are not recommended for routine diagnosis of sarcopenia [30].|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} an improved rig for the dynamic calibration of skinfold calipers. The new unit is 5 % lighter and almost 60 % smaller {{than its predecessor}} (Carlyon et al., 1996, 1998) with a 9. 5 mm solid aluminium base and a quick release caliper mount providing stability to both the rig and caliper. Automation of the gap controller {{with an electric motor}} standardizes the jaw opening and closing velocity, thereby enabling hands-free operation. Frictional losses in the moving components of the rig have been reduced by replacing the main bush of the swing arm with a bearing, reducing the mass of the swing arm, adding a support wheel {{to the end of the}} swing arm, and replacing fishing swivels with a universal joint to allow for changes in the opening screw angle as the <b>caliper's</b> <b>arm</b> moves through its arc. This rig can also be adapted to different types of calipers by changing the position of the load cell, microswitches, and the caliper mount. A universal mounting bracket that can be secured to almost any table supports the rig in a vertical plane when calibrating the load cell. To demonstrate the versatility of the calibration rig, preliminary data are presented for the upscale and downscale jaw pressures of seven Harpenden and seven Slim Guide calipers. G. B. Hewitt, R. T. Withers, A. G. Brooks, G. F. Woods and L. A. Da...|$|R
5000|$|Balance Truing Caliper: This {{device was}} used in {{fashioning}} the wheels and gearwork of the clock, {{to make sure the}} wheel, particularly the balance wheel was balanced and circular. The pivots of the wheel were mounted in the <b>caliper.</b> An index <b>arm</b> was moved next to the edge and the wheel was spun to see if the edge was true.|$|R
