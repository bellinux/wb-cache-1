In the experiments, <b>circle,</b> <b>ring</b> and rectangle mild steel sheets with thickness of 0. 8 mm are taken as workpieces and the experimental results show that nonlinear prolonged surface can be obtained by curvilinear scanning and there exists the obvious difference between circular scanning and linear scanning. Afterwards, the reason of the difference mentioned above is concisely analyzed. Finally, some suggestions are presented for the future investigation...|$|E

40|$|A quasi three {{dimensional}} {{simulation of}} devices with cylindrical symmetric struc-ture is presented [...] The basic semiconductor equations have been discretized for cyl in- 1. drical coordinates ~ Taking {{advantage of the}} symmetries {{it was possible to}} adapt a recently developed · two-dimensional numerical device simulation system without loosing its features of automatic grid generation and refinement. The method is demonstrated by simulating the on-characteristic of power thyristors. We compare and discuss the convergence properties and the physical results for planar and cylindrical discreti-zation. The simulations show no significant differences in the number of iterations and grid updates. The influence of the cylindrical symmetry depends on the location of the emitter contact and results in different transfer currents. The highest values have been calculated with a <b>circle</b> <b>ring</b> emitter. ...|$|E

The unit cell of the designed structure consists of <b>circle</b> <b>ring</b> resonators {{on top of a}} thin dielectric layer backed by a metallic mesh. The investigations on the distribution of the surface current and magnetic field as well as the analysis of the equivalent circuit model reveal that the magnetic resonance response between layers induced by the reverse surface current contributes to the high quality factor band-pass property. Importantly, it is a flexible design with a tunable resonance frequency by just changing the radius of the circle rings and can also be easily extended to have the multi-band-pass property. Moreover, this simplified structure with low duty cycle and ultra-thin thickness is also a symmetric design which is insensitive to the polarization and incident angles. Therefore, such a metamaterial narrow-band-pass filter is of great importance in the practical applications such as filtering and radar stealth, and especially for the conformal structure applications in the infrared and optical window area...|$|E

50|$|In San Giorgio in Braida the new bells {{were hung}} {{in such a}} way that the new style of ringing could develop. The bells are hung for full <b>circle</b> <b>ringing</b> where each bell is swung from {{balanced}} mouth uppermost through 360 degrees to again balanced mouth uppermost. This method of ringing permits a precise control of the time that the bell sounds and hence allows music. It is not clear whether hanging the bells in this way was independently developed at San Giorgio or whether the method was imported from England where bells are also hung for full <b>circle</b> <b>ringing.</b> Local farmers who attended church services and had an aptitude for music were chosen to ring and look after maintenance of the bells of San Giorgio.
