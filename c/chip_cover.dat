40|$|Medicaid and {{the state-run}} Children’s Health Insurance Program (<b>CHIP)</b> <b>cover</b> about 42 million children, {{many of whom}} would {{not have access to}} care without public insurance. Federal law {{requires}} that this access be equivalent to that of privately insured children for covered services, and many states have implemented policies to improve longstanding disparities in primary and preventive care. Reimbursement rates are up, but significant disparities remain, especially for dental and specialty services. It is important to understand the distinct effect of provider-related barriers, because they are potentially more modifiable through health policy than patient-related ones. This Issue Brief summarizes research that directly measures the willingness of dental and medical providers to see publicly-insured children, using research assistants posing as mothers calling for an urgent appointment for their child...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to evolve {{the design of a}} CNC desktop lathe for use in a project-based class and then fabricate a prototype to confirm the functionality of the design. This iteration of the lathe effectively reduces the cost, size, weight, and complexity of the machine to make the lathe more accessible and robust for use in as a learning tool. Elements from previous lathes are integrated into the new design along with other improvements. The original 14 "x 20 " footprint is reduced to 9. 5 "x 15 " by reconfiguring the actuators and integrating the spindle motor into the headstock. Redesigning the lead screw bearing configuration reduces the part count and complexity. Hard stops are added to the lead screw flexure {{to make it easier to}} handle during assembly. A bellow <b>chip</b> <b>cover</b> is added to keep the lathe cleaner during use. by Jonathan C. Hsieh. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{main features}} of {{two groups of}} logics for biological devices, called Physarum Chips, based on the plasmodium. Let us recall that the plasmodium is a single cell with many diploid nuclei. It propagates networks by growing pseudopodia to connect scattered nutrients (pieces of food). As a result, we deal {{with a kind of}} computing. The first group of logics for Physarum Chips formalizes the plasmodium behaviour under conditions of nutrient-poor substrate. This group can be defined as standard storage modification machines. The second group of logics for Physarum <b>Chips</b> <b>covers</b> the plasmodium computing under conditions of nutrient-rich substrate. In this case the plasmodium behaves in a massively parallel manner and propagates in all possible directions. The logics of the second group are unconventional and deal with non-well-founded data such as infinite streams...|$|R
50|$|States {{are given}} {{flexibility}} in designing their CHIP eligibility requirements and policies within broad federal guidelines. Some states have received authority through waivers of statutory provisions to use <b>CHIP</b> funds to <b>cover</b> {{the parents of}} children receiving benefits from both CHIP and Medicaid, pregnant women, and other adults. <b>CHIP</b> <b>covered</b> 7.6 million children during federal fiscal year 2010, and every state has an approved plan. Despite CHIP, the number of uninsured children continued to rise, particularly among families that cannot qualify for CHIP. An October 2007 study by the Vimo Research Group found that 68.7 percent of newly uninsured children were in families whose incomes were 200 {{percent of the federal}} poverty level or higher as more employers dropped dependents or dropped coverage altogether due to annual premiums nearly doubling between 2000 and 2006. Vimo cites the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured when it says 48 percent of the newly uninsured were not eligible for any kind of public coverage, and that only those in the lowest income bracket might offset the loss of employer-sponsored coverage with increases in Medicaid and SCHIP. In FY 2008, the program faced funding shortfalls in several states.|$|R

The chip comprises an integrated direct digital synthesizer (DDS) with a 10 -bit onchip digital-to-analog converter (DAC) using an n-well single-poly triple-metal 0. 5 -µm CMOS technology. The main features of the chip include maximum clock frequency of 100 MHz at 3. 3 -V supply voltage, 32 -bit frequency tuning word resolution, 12 -bit phase tuning word resolution, and an on-chip 10 -bit DAC. The chip provides sinusoidal, ramp, saw-tooth, and random waveforms with phase and frequency modulation, and power-down function. At 100 -MHz clock frequency, the <b>chip</b> <b>covers</b> a bandwidth from dc to 35 MHz in 0. 0233 -Hz frequency steps with 190 -ns frequency switching speed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{operating}} {{power of a}} TRIGA Mark III reactor was studied using Nuclear Track Methodology (NTM). The facility has a Highly Enriched Uranium core that provides a neutron flux of around 2 x 1012 n cm- 2 s- 1 in the TO- 2 irradiation channel. The detectors consisted of a Landauer® CR- 39 (allyl diglycol polycarbonate) <b>chip</b> <b>covered</b> with a 3 mm Plexiglas® converter. After irradiation, the detectors were chemically etched in a 6. 25 M-KOH solution at 60 ± 1 °C for 6 h. Track density was determined by a custom-made Digital Image Analysis System. The results show a direct proportionality between reactor power and average nuclear track density for powers in the range 0. 1 - 7 kW. Data reproducibility and relatively low uncertainty (± 3 %) were achieved. NTM is a simple, fast and reliable technique that {{can serve as a}} complementary procedure to measure reactor {{operating power}}.

30|$|We have {{investigated}} 11, 152 SNPs for association with diabetic nephropathy in individuals with {{type 2 diabetes}} recruited in Northern Ireland. Genotyping utilised a commercial panel that has demonstrated highly accurate and reproducible results, employing strict quality control parameters. Focusing on nsSNPs is an attractive approach since less common variants that may influence the risk of disease are directly genotyped. None of the available genome-wide panels that incorporate less than a million markers are optimised to capture nsSNPs. For example, the Affymetrix 500  K <b>chip</b> <b>covers</b> only 65 % of the common nsSNPs (≥ 5 % MAF) and 24 % of the rarer variants (< 5 % MAF) present on the HNS 12 panel with an r 2  >  0.8 in the CEU population (Evans et al. 2008). The Ensembl genome browser contains 97, 571 nsSNPs (www.ensembl.org, accessed 08 / 06 / 09) with a recent report describing 133, 505 coding SNPs in the human genome (Reumers et al. 2008), although {{it should be noted}} that many of these are not validated.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{interest of}} this study is to investigate surface immobilization strategies for proteins and other biomolecules by the surface plasmon field-enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy (SPFS) technique. The recrystallization features of the S-layer proteins and the possibility of combining the S-layer lattice arrays with other functional molecules make this protein a prime candidate for supramolecular architectures. The recrystallization behavior on gold or on the secondary cell wall polymer (SCWP) was recorded by SPR. The optical thicknesses and surface densities for different protein layers were calculated. In DNA hybridization tests performed in order to discriminate different mismatches, recombinant S-layer-streptavidin fusion protein matrices showed their potential for new microarrays. Moreover, SCWPs coated gold <b>chips,</b> <b>covered</b> with a controlled and oriented assembly of S-layer fusion proteins, represent an even more sensitive fluorescence testing platform. Additionally, S-layer fusion proteins as the matrix for LHCII immobilization strongly demonstrate superiority over routine approaches, proving the possibility of utilizing them as a new strategy for biomolecular coupling. In the study of the SPFS hCG immunoassay, the biophysical and immunological characteristics of this glycoprotein hormone were presented first.
