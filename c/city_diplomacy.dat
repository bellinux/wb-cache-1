5000|$|The archaic temeton {{beneath the}} later temples clearly housed {{some form of}} [...] "Great Goddess" [...] but nothing is known of her cult. The {{literary}} accounts that describe it as [...] "Amazonian" [...] refer to the later founder-myths of Greek emigres who developed the cult and temple of Artemis Ephesia. The wealth and splendor of temple and city were taken as evidence of Artemis Ephesia's power, and were the basis for her local and international prestige: despite the successive traumas of Temple destruction, each rebuilding - a gift and honor to the goddess - brought further prosperity. Large numbers of people came to Ephesus in March and {{in the beginning of}} May to attend the main Artemis Procession. Artemis' shrines, temples and festivals (Artemisia) could be found throughout the Greek world, but Ephesian Artemis was unique. The Ephesians considered her theirs, and resented any foreign claims to her protection. Once Persia ousted and replaced their Lydian overlord Croesus, the Ephesians played down his contribution to the Temple's restoration. On the whole, the Persians dealt fairly with Ephesus, but removed some religious artifacts from Artemis' Temple to Sardis and brought Persian priests into her Ephesian cult; this was not forgiven. When Alexander conquered the Persians, his offer to finance the Temple's second rebuilding was politely but firmly refused. Ephesian Artemis lent her <b>city's</b> <b>diplomacy</b> a powerful religious edge.|$|R

50|$|The International Association of Peace Messenger Cities was {{established}} in 1988 and now administers the programme according to the statute of the Association and criteria for membership. The International Association of Peace Messenger Cities {{was established}} to recognize and encourage the role and responsibility cities have in creating a culture of peace. The IAPMC had its first meeting in Verdun France in 1988. It was formalized at a General Assembly meeting in New Haven, Connecticut, USA in 1990. Our first Statute was adopted in Marrakech, Morocco in 1991. The organization {{was born out of}} United Nations General Assembly designation as Peace Messengers based on idea that municipal authorities have profound responsibility to assume an active, creative role in establishing a Culture of Peace within their borders. Member cities of the Association meet twice a year with the aim of exchanging programmes, ideas and experience in cities around the globe. Their website, http://www.iapmc.org, is active after the General Assembly which was held in Slovenj Gradec, Slovenia. The IAPMC has been extensively involved in numerous peace campaigns, banning of anti-personnel landmines campaign, nuclear non-proliferation, human rights, and has attracted substantial public awareness in peacemaking efforts of the United Nations Organization, Economic and Social Council, Department of Public Information and other bodies. The participation at the international conferences throughout the years of IAPMC activities has been notable at prominent events such as World Social Forum, First World Conference on <b>City</b> <b>Diplomacy</b> (The Hague, 2008) etc. It {{has been one of the}} sponsors and co-organizers of Haifa International Conference for a WMD-Free Middle East in 2013. The organization is also a member of Abolition 2000 and cooperates well with similar organizations, such as Mayors for Peace.|$|E

Originally called Israel Video Blog, the site was launched on February 16, 2006 by the Consulate General of Israel in New York. In October 2006, the blog was relaunched as isRealli, with the tagline, “The New Blog of Israel.” This was the first initiative by the Israeli Consulate in New York <b>City</b> in Public <b>Diplomacy</b> 2.0. Following the success of isRealli, the Consulate launched a series of new media projects including a MySpace page, YouTube site, political blog, and Twitter press conference, which was widely reported by news media around the world. isRealli is maintained {{on a daily basis}} by the media and public affairs team at the Consulate General of Israel in New York.|$|R
2500|$|Today, a city's {{promotion}} of its cultural activities dovetails with place branding and <b>city</b> marketing, public <b>diplomacy</b> techniques used to inform development strategy; to attract businesses, investors, residents, and tourists; {{and to create}} a shared identity [...] and sense of place within the metropolitan area. Physical inscriptions, plaques, and monuments on display physically transmit a historical context for urban places. Some cities, such as Jerusalem, Mecca, and Rome have indelible religious status and for hundreds of years have attracted pilgrims. Patriotic tourists visit Agra to see the Taj Mahal, or New York City to visit Ground Zero. Elvis lovers visit Memphis to pay their respects at Graceland. Place brands (which include place satisfaction and place loyalty) have great economic value (comparable to the value of commodity brands) because of their influence on the decision-making process of people thinking about doing business in—"purchasing" [...] (the brand of)—a city.|$|R
40|$|<b>City</b> <b>diplomacy</b> {{emerged from}} {{different}} shifts within diplomacy. First of all, traditional {{state to state}} diplomacy, with professional diplomats {{as the most important}} actors, shifted to a multi leveled diplomacy in which regions and cities also play a role. Public diplomacy, in which regular citizens are the most important actors, also became increasingly popular, especially in times of war. <b>City</b> <b>diplomacy</b> is defined as the processes by which cities engage in international relations and how they represent themselves and their interests. This research focused on the friendship between the municipality of Utrecht, the Netherlands and the city of Portland Oregon, USA. There are two important dimensions within this friendship. These two dimensions are culture and economy. Cultural diplomacy is the communication between governments and foreign people. It connects people across the borders to exchange ideas and interests. Utrecht and Portland are very similar cities and both have citizens who are alternative, green and like bicycling and drinking beer. This {{is one of the reasons}} why these two cities connected. Economy and diplomacy always heavily intertwined. Both Utrecht and Portland have growing economies and benefit from trading with one another. There are many initiatives to exchange knowledge increase trade, especially within microbreweries and the ‘made movement’. What is striking about this case about Utrecht and Portland is that it shows how <b>city</b> <b>diplomacy</b> evolved from being mostly about development and supporting cities in conflict areas to connecting culturally and economically benefit from the other city. The Utrecht-Portland connection officially started in 2012 and is still developing, but already shows that city connections are very important for the city as a whole. Not only the municipality benefits from it, but also the citizens profit from the friendship...|$|E
