Muon-catalyzed fusion was a field of some interest during the 1980s as a potential energy source; however, its low energy output appears to be unavoidable (because of alpha-muon sticking losses). Jones led a research team that, in 1986, achieved 150 fusions per muon (average), releasing over 2,600 MeV of fusion energy per muon, a record which still stands.|$|E

40|$|Several evidences of {{anomalous}} nuclear reactions {{occurring in}} condensed matter {{have been observed}} in the phenomenon of electrolysis. Despite the great amount of experimental results coming from the so-called <b>Cold</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Fusion</b> research activities, the comprehension of these phenomena still remains unsatisfactory.

In the present paper, a mechanical explanation is proposed considering a new kind of nuclear reactions, the piezonuclear fissions, which are a consequence of hydrogen embrittlement of the electrodes during electrolysis. The experimental activity was conducted using a Ni-Fe anode and a Co-Cr cathode immersed in a potassium carbonate solution. Emissions of neutrons and alpha particles were measured during the experiments and the electrode compositions were analyzed {{both before and after the}} electrolysis, revealing the effects of piezonuclear fissions occurring in the host lattices. The symmetrical fission of Ni appears to be the most evident observation. Such reaction would produce two Si atoms or two Mg atoms with alpha particles and neutrons as additional fragments...|$|E

40|$|The {{interfacial}} {{properties of}} palladium electrode in sulfate solutions of different pH values {{have been investigated}} using the piezoelectric response of surface stress change induced by a potential modulation. It was found from the piezoe-lectric signals that the potential of electrocapillary maximum, Emax or potential of zero charge (pzc) {{is present in the}} poten-tial region of hydrogen absorption into Pd. The pH dependence of pzc was measured in the range from pH 0. 7 to 12. 8. Below pH 6. 0, pzc was close to the equilibrium potential of hydride formation. Above pH 6. 0, pzc was higher than that of hydride formation. The piezoelectric signals obtained in the potential region of oxide formation suggested that sign-rever-sal of surface charge takes place in the potential range of PdO monolayer formation which is similar to Pt electrode. Many studies of hydrogen absorption into palladium electrode during electrolysis have been performed so far because of its large capacity of hydrogen absorption (1). Furthermore, the interfacial studies of palladium electrode have attracted special attention in relation to <b>cold</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> which has been reported by Fleischmann etal. (2).

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{provided evidence}} of piezonuclear reactions occurring in condensed matter during electrolysis. These experiments {{were characterized by}} significant neutron and alpha particle emissions, together with appreciable variations in the chemical composition at the electrode surfaces. A mechanical reason for the so-called <b>Cold</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Fusion</b> was recently proposed by the authors. The hydrogen embrittlement due to H atoms produced by the electrolysis plays an essential role for the observed micro-cracking in the electrode host metals (Pd and Ni). Consequently, our hypothesis is that piezonuclear fission reactions may occur in correspondence to the micro-crack formation or propagation. In order to confirm the early results obtained by the Ni-Fe and Co-Cr electrodes and presented in the companion paper (Part I), electrolytic tests have been conducted using 100 % Pd at the cathode and 90 % Ni at the anode. As a result, relevant compositional changes {{and the appearance of}} elements previously absent have been observed on the Pd and Ni electrodes after the experiments, as well as significant neutron emissions. The most relevant process emerging from the experiment is the primary fission of palladium into iron and calcium. Then, secondary fissions of both the products as well as of nickel in the other electrode appear in turn producing oxygen atoms, alpha particles, and neutrons...|$|E

40|$|In the {{controversy}} in 1989 over the reported achievement of <b>cold</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion,</b> {{parts of the}} physics and chemistry communities were opposed in both a theoretic and a professional competition. Physicists saw the chemists ' announcement as an incursion into territory allocated to their own discipline and strove to restore the interdisciplinary boundaries that had previously held. The events that followed throw light on {{the manner in which}} scientists ' knowledge claims and metascientific beliefs are affected by their membership of disciplinary communities. In particular, {{the controversy}} offers evidence for a constructivist reinterpretation of the "division of nature into levels, " which is customarily held to underpin the division of science into disciplines. 1. Cognitive Sociology and Disciplinary Phenomena Phenomena arising from the division of science into separate disciplines have been extensively studied by historians and sociologists of science, in several waves. Among the earliest studies were those contributing to "interest theory, " or the sociological explanation of scientists'general behavior by appeal to their professional interests. These studies focused heavily on competition among practitioners within single disciplines. Such competition is fueled by the practitioners ' knowledge that reward is made available in only limited amount by the professional organizations that govern the discipline. It frequently centers on priority of discovery, or of announcement of discovery, because such priority has come to constitute an important determinant of the distribution of rewards within science. 1 While competition within individual disciplines received close attention from studie...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{contains a}} tally of cold fusion papers from two sources: the list maintained by Dieter Britz at Aarhus U., and the EndNote database {{used to generate}} the indexes at LENR-CANR. org. Various tallies such {{as the number of}} peer-reviewed experimental papers are presented. Purpose This report presents some background and a breakdown of the items in two databases of cold fusion papers: the Britz collection, and the LENR-CANR database. The purpose is to give the reader a sense of the scale, variety, and sources of the material available about this subject. This is also intended to give some indication of how much has been published on cold fusion, where it was published, and approximately how many positive and negative papers have been published. This paper includes the following tallies: 1. Summary statistics for the LENR-CANR database 2. Positive, peer-reviewed excess heat papers culled from both databases. 3. Papers from Britz collection. 4. Famous failed neutron studies from 1989. These had a large influence on scientific opinion and the subsequent history of the field, but many cold fusion researchers believe they were flawed and should not be given weight today. Details from these four tallies are gathered in Appendix A. They include multipage lists of journal titles, authors and the individual titles of papers referenced in the four tallies.

40|$|This book {{presents}} the relevant consequences of recently discovered and interdisciplinary phenomena triggered by local mechanical instabilities. Vibrations at the TeraHertz frequency {{are in fact}} produced at the nano-scale in solids and fluids by fracture and cavitation, respectively. They present a frequency close to that of resonance in the atomic lattices and an energy close to that of thermal neutrons. A series of fracture experiments on natural rocks demonstrate that the TeraHertz vibrations are able to induce fission reactions on medium weight elements accompanied by neutron emissions, without gamma radiation and radioactive wastes. The same phenomenon appears to have occurred in several different situations and, in particular, in the chemical evolution of Earth and Solar System, through seismicity (rocky planets) and storms (gaseous planets). It can also explain puzzles related {{to the history of}} our planet, like the ocean formation or the primordial carbon pollution, as well as scientific mysteries, like the so-called <b>cold</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> or the correct radio-carbon dating of organic materials. Very important applications to earthquake precursors, climate change, energy production, and cellular biology cannot be excluded in the future {{on the basis of the}} topics treated in the present volume.
