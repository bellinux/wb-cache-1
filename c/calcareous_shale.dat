2500|$|The Cottonwood Limestone is {{a marine}} {{limestone}} and <b>calcareous</b> <b>shale,</b> laterally persistent, bench-forming, and notably and consistently showing abundant fossils. An outstanding example of uniformity of thickness over considerable areas, the outcrop of the Cottonwood Limestone over {{a distance of}} 150 miles from Nebraska to central Kansas is nowhere less than 5.5 nor more than 6.5 feet. The notable consistency of these characteristics within its range serves {{to make it a}} distinctive marker bed. [...] Even so, there are some changes in lithologic character that can be seen from north to south.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{abundance}} of fusulinids remains a characteristic {{of the top of}} the Cottonwood through to Osage County, Oklahoma, south of Chase County, Kansas the member has lost its massive limestone characteristic and does not form the conspicuous outcrops seen farther north. [...] In Greenwood County, Kansas, the unit appears as light-gray limestone crowded with horizontal thin leaves of platy algae, attaining a maximum observed thickness of 8 feet. The Cottonwood in southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma is an interbedded limestone and <b>calcareous</b> <b>shale</b> with a very diverse, abundant, and well-preserved fossil fauna, especially brachiopods, mollusks, and ammodiscid foraminifera (shelly facies). At the southern limit of its outcrop the Cottonwood Limestone is a medium crystalline limestone with thin, shelly layers. Mollusks, Osagia, and quartz silt are common (silty Osagia facies).|$|E
60|$|After {{passing for}} a few miles over the coast {{granitic}} series, {{we come to the}} porphyritic conglomerate, with its usual characters, and with some of the beds distinctly displaying their mechanical origin. The strata, where first met with, are, as before stated, only slightly inclined; but near the Hacienda of Pluclaro, we come to an anticlinal axis, with the beds much dislocated and shifted by a great fault, of which not a trace is externally seen in the outline of the hill. I believe that this anticlinal axis can be traced northwards, into the district of Arqueros, where a conspicuous hill called Cerro Blanco, formed of a harsh, cream-coloured euritic rock, including a few crystals of reddish feldspar, and associated with some purplish claystone porphyry, seems to fall on a line of elevation. In descending from the Arqueros district, I crossed on the northern border of the valley, strata inclined eastward from the Pluclaro axis: on the porphyritic conglomerate there rested a mass, some hundred feet thick, of brown argillaceous limestone, in parts crystalline, and in parts almost composed of Hippurites Chilensis, d'Orbigny; above this came a black <b>calcareous</b> <b>shale,</b> and on it a red conglomerate. In the brown limestone, with the Hippurites, there was an impression of a Pecten and a coral, and great numbers of a large Gryphaea, very like, and, according to Professor E. Forbes, probably identical with G. Orientalis, Forbes MS.,--a cretaceous species (probably upper greensand) from Verdachellum, in Southern India. These fossils seem to occupy nearly the same position with those at the Puente del Inca,--namely, {{at the top of the}} porphyritic conglomerate, and at the base of the gypseous formation.|$|E

The grey shales have higher concentration of SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3, K 2 O, Zr, Th, U, V, Cr, La, Ce, and Y than <b>calcareous</b> <b>shales,</b> whereas <b>calcareous</b> <b>shales</b> are enriched in CaO, Mn, Sr, Ba, Cu, and Zn, which indicate that the carbonate phase minerals are higher in <b>calcareous</b> <b>shales.</b> The positive correlation of K 2 O with other elements, and abundance of Al 2 O 3, Ba, Th, and Rb suggest that these elements are primarily controlled by the dominant clay minerals. La/Sc, Th/Sc, Th/Co, Th/Cr, and Cr/Th ratios of shales were {{compared with those of}} sediments derived from felsic and basic rocks (fi ne fraction), upper continental crust (UCC) and post-Archean Australian average shale (PAAS) ratios, which reveal that these ratios are within the range of felsic rocks. The La/Sc vs. Th/Co plot also suggests the felsic nature of the source rocks. The shales show slightly light rare earthelement (LREE) enriched and fl at heavy rare earth element (HREE) patterns with negative Eu anomaly, and are similar to the granitoids from Dharwar Craton, which suggest that the Archean Dharwar Craton contributed the sediments to the Bhima basin.

60|$|In {{the valley}} basin of the Yeso, which I {{estimated}} at 7,000 {{feet above the}} level of the sea, we first reach at [F] the gypseous formation. Its thickness is very great. It consists in most parts of snow-white, hard, compact gypsum, which breaks with a saccharine fracture, having translucent edges; under the blowpipe gives out much vapour; it frequently includes nests and exceedingly thin layers of crystallised, blackish carbonate of lime. Large, irregularly shaped concretions (externally still exhibiting lines of aqueous deposition) of blackish-grey, but sometimes white, coarsely and brilliantly crystallised, hard anhydrite, abound within the common gypsum. Hillocks, formed of the hardest and purest varieties of the white gypsum, stand up above the surrounding parts, and have their surfaces cracked and marked, just like newly baked bread. There is much pale brown, soft argillaceous gypsum; and there were some intercalated green beds which I had not time to reach. I saw only one fragment of selenite or transparent gypsum, and that perhaps may have come from some subsequently formed vein. From the mineralogical characters here given, it is probable that these gypseous beds have undergone some metamorphic action. The strata are much hidden by detritus, but they appeared in most parts to be highly inclined; and in an adjoining lofty pinnacle they could be distinctly seen bending up, and becoming vertical, conformably with the underlying porphyritic conglomerate. In very many parts of the great mountain-face [F], composed of thin gypseous beds, there were innumerable masses, irregularly shaped and not like dikes, yet with well-defined edges, of an imperfectly granular, pale greenish, or yellowish-white rock, essentially composed of feldspar, with a little chlorite or hornblende, epidote, iron-pyrites, and ferruginous powder: I believe that these curious trappean masses have been injected from the not far distant mountain-mass [E] of andesite whilst still fluid, and that owing to the softness of the gypseous strata they have not acquired the ordinary forms of dikes. Subsequently to the injection of these feldspathic rocks, a great dislocation has taken place; and the much shattered gypseous strata here overlie a hillock [G], composed of vertical strata of impure limestone and of black highly <b>calcareous</b> <b>shale</b> including threads of gypsum: these rocks, as we shall presently see, belong to the upper parts of the gypseous series, and hence must here have been thrown down by a vast fault.|$|E
