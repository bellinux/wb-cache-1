The cause of this was no ill- timed delicacy {{on the part of}} the gentlemen of the press to assert their privilege of universal presence wherever a few are met together, and to commit to the public prints whatever may then and there pass of the most private nature. But very unusual and arbitrary methods were resorted to on the present occasion to prevent the reporters using a right which is generally conceded to them by almost all meetings, whether of a political or <b>commercial</b> <b>description.</b> Our own reporter, indeed, was bold enough to secrete himself under the Secretary's table, and was not discovered till the meeting was well-nigh over. We are sorry to say, he suffered much in person from fists and toes, and two or three principal pages were torn out of his note-book, which occasions his report to break off abruptly. We cannot but consider this behaviour as more particularly illiberal on the part of men who are themselves a kind of gentlemen of the press; and they ought to consider themselves as fortunate that the misused reporter has sought no other vengeance than from the tone of acidity with which he has seasoned his account of their proceedings.--Edinburgh Newspaper.] ...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study the thermal and polymorphic behavior of four different industrial lauric fats which are sold under the same <b>commercial</b> <b>description,</b> was compared (1). According to the findings the four fats were split in two groups based on the similarities found at polymorphic level. In the present paper two of these industrial lauric fats (F 1 and F 2, one from each group) were incorporated into oil -in -water emulsions. The objective {{of this study was}} to point out the differences in the crystallization and polymorphic behavior between bulk and emulsified fat. Moreover anhydrous milk fat (AMF) was used in the same way for comparison. For that purpose, the fats were investigated for their thermal and polymorphic behavior by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), both in bulk and emulsified state. The DSC and X -Ray investigations made possible the observation of the differences in the crystallization behavior and kinetics that occurred for those fats in the bulk and emulsified state. 1.

40|$|This {{illustrated}} essay {{explores the}} idea of the type specimen historically as a way of contextualising issues surrounding the production of a type specimen within the current markets. The essay’s critical contribution is to broaden the limited <b>commercial</b> <b>description</b> of specimen material typical within the field by drawing together a range of perspectives. The type specimen is interrogated not only as design object and branding exercise but also in terms of its role within academic scholarship and as a tool of craft-based discipline and trade. A functional link is made with the other lettering trades of stone-cutting and calligraphy. In 'Showing Type' I was able to explore the relationship between technology and the contemporary market, discursively outlining issues relating to {{the idea of}} the artefact within the increasingly intangible context of online product design. Located within a type specimen itself, this writing intentionally plays with traditions of design and scholarship within the commercial typographic sphere. A model for authoritative information-giving as a reinforcement of quality and worth borrowed from early twentieth century specimen examples is here reworked to explore appropriately the ideas of 'value' and 'collectability' reflected through the idiosyncratic use of a book format...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{customisation}} of {{a vehicle}} on a production line results from the assembly of several hundreds of alternative components. Bills of Material (BOM) are usually made for operational purposes (to define the list of components to be assembled on a vehicle), for planning (to anticipate component procurement needs) and for commercial needs (guide customer choice and prepare sales forecasts). In the automotive industry, the diversity of end products which results from this combinatorial process (several millions) is such as no solution proposed in the literature allows to easily list the BOMs for all these vehicles. In our paper, we describe and theorise a solution used for many years by several carmakers, which consists in introducing a <b>commercial</b> <b>description</b> of the products {{in addition to their}} common organic representation. We show that this solution is an extension of the generic and modular BOM theory, recognised to be the most advanced solutions proposed in the literature. While fully meeting commercial and production control needs, this product description paradigm has limitations when it comes to determining the Master Production Schedules (MPS) at end product level beyond the frozen horizon, as performed by several automakers. An alternative approach defining MPSs at alternative component level is proposed in the literature. However, this approach also has several drawbacks that we point out. To overcome these issues, we propose a number of possible strategic and organisational tracks of improvement...|$|E

40|$|Ericsson has {{recently}} experienced difficulties {{to meet the}} customer demand, {{which has led to}} lost market shares. This is mainly due to the long and unpredictable lead times within their supply chains. Therefore, Ericsson seeks to increase their ability to meet the customer demand by reducing the customer order lead time. A shorter lead time would imply a greater responsiveness and improved service level towards the customers. A directive from the company was to base the study on the supply chain for the customer Algeria Telecom Mobile. The purpose of the study is to give recommendations for improvements that reduce the total lead time in a supply chain perspective in order to improve the customer service level.   To be able to fulfill the purpose, four objectives were distinguished and supported with existing frameworks for analyzing supply chains. The first step was to create a current state map, which was achieved by conducting 24 interviews with people working within the supply chain. The second step was to identify potentials for lead time reduction. This was done by categorizing the supply chain parts and the problems that were gathered during the current state mapping into meaningful groups, and thereafter prioritize the categories with the greatest potential. The third step was to generate alternative solutions by conducting a second literature review based on the potentials that was identified during the prior step. The general solutions were later modified in order to fit the current supply chain. It resulted in eight Ericsson specific solutions. The fourth step was to evaluate these solutions in combination, which led to a recommended combination of solutions that provided the greatest lead time reduction. Also the requirements for implementing these solutions were presented in this step.   The recommendation for Ericsson is to rearrange their current supply chain for the studied customer and use two different supply chains; the Regional supply chain and the Alternative supply chain. The two arrangements will both be based on the implementation of a supply hub, which implies a movement of the customer order decoupling point closer to the customer. The Regional supply chain will cover the main flow and be used when the customer orders products from a product portfolio that has been agreed within the region. The Alternative supply chain will act as a complement and cover the flow of products outside the regional product portfolio.    The estimated customer order lead time for the Regional supply chain is 17 days, which is a reduction of 80 % in the normal case for the studied supply chain. The lead time for the Alternative supply chain is more difficult to estimate precisely, but it will be reduced in comparison with the current situation. Moreover, the service level towards the customer will be increased for both the Regional and the Alternative supply chain. To summarize the recommendations that are forwarded to Ericsson, they are listed below:  Implement a regional supply hub  Agree on a regional product portfolio  Implement time slots for inbound flows  Use BPO as a payment method instead of Letter of Credit  Use a CIP, DAP or DAT Incoterm  Implement a product configurator and let the customer place orders on <b>commercial</b> <b>descriptions</b> or a solution id.   Integrate processes and activities throughout the supply chain and establish a greater information exchange...|$|R
