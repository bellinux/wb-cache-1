We have developed a suite of programs that manipulates worksheets, grades worksheets, provides interactive tutorials, and stores <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>graded</b> materials and grades. The system "Uses Maple to grade Maple", having as its core a special "grader package" that exports various procedures that are used to analyze and grade Maple worksheets. We ask students to work problems written in preformatted Maple worksheets, and then to assign their answers to carefully chosen names. The values assigned to names such as ans 1, my plot and my third answer may be the output of any Maple computation. The eGrader is thus limited only by the limits of Maple itself. During the fall 2001 and spring 2002 semesters we stress-tested the system, grading over 130, 000 problems for all sections of the engineering calculus courses...|$|R

40|$|Guided {{reading is}} a {{component}} of a balancedliteracy program providing differentiated,small-group reading instruction to four to six students with similar strengths and instructional needs (Fountas & Pinnell, 1996) or to heterogeneously grouped students (Cunningham, Hall, & Sigmon, 2000). It is recommended that these groups meet at least {{three to five times}} per week for 20 to 30 minutes each session in order for students to make consistent reading gains (Fountas & Pinnell, 1996). This ap-proach to reading instruction provides teachers the opportunity to explicitly teach children the skills and comprehension strategies students need, thus facili-tating the acquisition of reading proficiency. Multiple <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>graded</b> leveled books are carefully selected and used by the teacher based on the children’s in-structional needs and interests. According to Reutzel and Cooter (2005), graded leveled books are typically categorized to include four levels of children’s reading development: early emergent, emergent, early fluency, and fluency. The language of these leveled texts devel-opmentally matches the syntax and organization of most young children’s speech. It is important that texts chosen for the guided-reading groups provide children with a reasonable challenge but also present an oppor-tunity for potential success. In implementing guide...|$|R

Then, one <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> that <b>grade</b> {{is removed from}} each remaining candidate's list <b>of</b> <b>grades,</b> and the new median is found, until there is an unambiguous winner. For instance, if candidate X's sorted ratings were ("Good", [...] "Good", [...] "Fair", [...] "Poor"), while candidate Y had ("Excellent", [...] "Fair", [...] "Fair", [...] "Fair"), the rounded medians would both be [...] "Fair". After removing one [...] "Fair" [...] from each list, the new lists are, respectively, ("Good", [...] "Good", [...] "Poor") and ("Excellent", [...] "Fair", [...] "Fair"), so X would win with a recalculated median of [...] "Good".
