2500|$|Starting in the 1930s, {{before some}} modern {{concepts}} of psychopathy were developed, [...] "sexual psychopath" [...] laws, the term referring broadly to mental illness, were introduced by some states, {{and by the}} mid-1960s {{more than half of}} the states had such laws.

2500|$|In America, Friends Asylum (1817) and the Hartford Retreat (1824) {{were among}} the first asylums within the private sector, yet public asylums were soon encouraged, with Dorothea Dix as one of its key lobbyists. The {{effectiveness}} of asylums was dependent on a collection of structural and external conditions, conditions that proponents began to recognize were unfeasible to maintain around the mid-nineteenth century. For example, with the proliferation of immigrants throughout industrialization, the original purpose of asylums as small facilities transformed into their actualized use as [...] "large, custodial institutions" [...] throughout the late 1840s. Overcrowding severely inhibited the therapeutic capacity, inciting a political reassessment period about alternatives to asylums around the 1870s. The legislative purpose of state asylums soon met the role society had funneled them toward; they primarily became institutions for <b>community</b> <b>protection,</b> with treatment secondary.|$|E

Prajesh Shrestha argues that the 2014 amendments undermine the presumption of innocence, because the protection of the community is given more weight than the presumption of innocence, and that the 'show cause' provision gives the burden of proof to the defendant, not the prosecutor and goes against the presumption of innocence, and that adding in the victim's views is unnecessary and [...] "highly prejudicial to the rights of the accused".|$|E
