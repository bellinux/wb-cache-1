5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for the chest and underwear cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back. The size of a bikini bottom <b>can</b> <b>range</b> from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E

5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and <b>can</b> <b>range</b> from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are also}} {{valuable}} sources for squid giant axons used in research in neuroscience and physiology. Unlike axons of other animals, squid axons are very large. Those of bigfin reef squids <b>can</b> <b>range</b> in diameter from 350 to 560μm (in {{contrast to the}} typical 1μm for humans). In life, these giant axons are used by the squids to coordinate escape jetting behaviour, enabling the squid to contract its muscles {{in a split second}} directly from the brain.|$|E
5|$|During {{a typical}} game {{the number of}} {{officials}} <b>can</b> <b>range</b> from one to three, depending on the league and level of play. In most games {{there are at least}} two referees: a lead official and a trail official. In NLL games there are three officials per game.|$|E
50|$|Veterinarians employ three general methods: tonometry, gonioscopy, and ophthalmoscopy. Tonometry {{measures}} the intraocular pressure with an instrument. Normal intraocular pressure in dogs <b>can</b> <b>ranges</b> from , and both eyes should be similar in pressure. Gonioscopy is a diagnostic procedure {{to examine the}} angle of the anterior chamber.

5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of {{approximately}} {{the same size as}} the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) <b>can</b> <b>range</b> from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. Only a small percentage of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E
5|$|Fly agarics {{are known}} for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount {{ingested}} per body weight, effects <b>can</b> <b>range</b> from nausea and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Hypersensitivity is {{an immune}} {{response}} that damages the body's own tissues. They {{are divided into}} four classes (Type I– IV) based on the mechanisms involved and {{the time course of}} the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms <b>can</b> <b>range</b> from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen.|$|E

5|$|In dogs, canine {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder {{can lead to}} self-inflicted injuries, for example canine lick granuloma. Captive birds are sometimes known to engage in feather-plucking, causing damage to feathers that <b>can</b> <b>range</b> from feather shredding to the removal of most or all feathers within the bird's reach, or even the mutilation of skin or muscle tissue.|$|E
5|$|Stud {{fees for}} stallions that enter {{breeding}} <b>can</b> <b>range</b> from $2,500 to $500,000 per mare in the United States, and from ₤2000 to £75,000 {{or more in}} Britain. The record stud fee to date was set in the 1980s, when the stud fee of the late Northern Dancer reached $1 million. During the 2008 Australian breeding season seven stallions stood at a stud fee of A$110,000 or more, with the highest fee in the nation at A$302,500.|$|E
5|$|The Lights {{were banned}} from photographing all of Central America except Guatemala, Ecuador, and Colombia, {{as a safety}} measure against the {{gathering}} of strategic knowledge. They {{took advantage of the}} Peruvian government's allowal to take pictures in the air by capturing the earliest photographs of the Nazca lines.

5|$|The blast {{caused by}} a sudden release of the gas {{pressure}} inside a diving cylinder makes them very dangerous if mismanaged. The greatest risk of explosion exists while filling, but cylinders have also been known to burst when overheated. The cause of failure <b>can</b> <b>range</b> from reduced wall thickness or deep pitting due to internal corrosion, neck thread failure due to incompatible valve threads, or cracking due to fatigue, sustained high stresses, or overheating effects in aluminum.|$|E
5|$|The floral tube {{is formed}} by fusion of the basal {{segments}} of the tepals (proximally connate). Its shape is from an inverted cone (obconic) to funnel-shaped (funneliform) or cylindrical, and is surmounted by the more distal corona. Floral tubes <b>can</b> <b>range</b> from long and narrow in sections Apodanthi and Jonquilla to rudimentary (N. cavanillesii).|$|E
5|$|Tolerances {{are usually}} ±0.002in (±0.05mm), but in precise {{applications}} a tolerance of ±0.0005in (±0.01mm) can be held.

The factor responsible for this distinction {{can be found in}} the syntax and empirical evidence is also provided to justify this hypothesis. Moreover, I discover two special requirements of gezi which have a lot to do with the adverb zi. ...|$|R

5|$|Vanadinite is very brittle, {{producing}} small, conchoidal fragments when fractured. Its hardness is 3–4 on the Mohs scale, {{about the}} same as a copper coin. Vanadinite is particularly heavy for a translucent mineral. It has a molar mass of 1416.27g/mole and its specific gravity <b>can</b> <b>range</b> between 6.6 and 7.2 because of impurities.|$|E
5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam <b>can</b> <b>range</b> from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E

30|$|However, {{once the}} {{attacker}} <b>can</b> observe <b>range</b> queries and range query results, they may again {{be able to}} infer the order of distinguishable ciphertexts. When {{the order of the}} ciphertexts is known, BKS knowledge can be applied to reveal confidential attribute values. Therefore, in order to protect against an attacker that <b>can</b> observe <b>range</b> queries and has BKS knowledge, an approach needs to provide access confidentiality to hide the query results. The same holds true for attackers that are able to observe modifications because a modification often implies the evaluation of a query.|$|R
