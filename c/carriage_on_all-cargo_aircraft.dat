40|$|The October 2010 {{discovery}} of two explosive devices {{being prepared for}} loading on U. S. -bound <b>all-cargo</b> <b>aircraft</b> overseas has heightened concerns over the potential use of air cargo shipments to bomb passenger and <b>all-cargo</b> <b>aircraft.</b> This incident renewed congressional interest in air cargo security. This report discusses a number of policy issues that may arise regarding air cargo security...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the air cargo demand {{is based on the}} application of a system engineering technique which includes 12 conditional factors. Firstly the intercontinental trade, the latest development of logistics and the influences of the changes in prices and the supply of air cargo transport are explained in detail. During the next step the reciprocal influence of each of the factors is discussed separately and formally interpreted. As a result a formal method to estimate the volume and the composition of the air cargo demand is developed. The description of the rudiments of the organisation of the air cargo supply includes an explanation of the principal settings of the market. Apart from the segmentation of the supply into three different levels of quality, an approach to assess the individual features of the air cargo supply is proposed. Following this the air cargo volume of all European airports is systematically analysed. First the belly volume of passenger aircraft is observed, distinguishing the intercontinental and the continental volume. Moreover the air cargo transport <b>on</b> board of <b>all-cargo</b> <b>aircraft</b> counted at European airports is analysed. From this a formal model to explain the air cargo volume of an individual airport is evolved. This is based on the premise of widely liberal terms of competition within the air cargo-market and takes into account the Western European conditions. The air cargo supply is modelled analogous to the basic conditions of the decision making process of the air cargo industry. The suitability of the model for forecating is derived from ist application at the Munich airport. For the first time it is possible to consider the full variety of all conditional factors of the air cargo volume systematically. It can thus be concluded that the supply of the air cargo industry finally determines the volume and the structure of the air cargo of an airport.

50|$|MD-11F (53 built): the Freight {{transport}} aircraft {{was the second}} variant on offer at launch in 1986 and was the last and longest (1988-2000) manufactured version. The <b>all-cargo</b> <b>aircraft</b> features the same forward port side cargo door (140 x 102 in) as the MD-11CF, a main deck volume of , a maximum payload of 200151 lb and can transport 26 pallets of the same dimensions (88 x 125 in or 96 x 125 in) as for the MD-11C and MD-11CF. The MD-11F was delivered between 1991 and 2001 to FedEx Express (22), Lufthansa Cargo (14), and other airlines with fewer aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Ager-Hanssen and Porter {{also had}} a {{controlling}} stake in the English-based freight operator Global Supply Systems (GSS). GSS was launched in 2001 as a British all-cargo carrier whose principal business was providing aircraft on long-term leases to other airlines on an ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, Insurance) basis. Global Supply Systems was joint venture with Atlas Air Worldwide. Atlas air is operating the world's largest fleet of modern Boeing 747 <b>all-cargo</b> <b>aircraft</b> and was a 49% partner in GSS. In 2007 Porter and Ager-Hanssen´s GSS signed a 5-year contract with British Airways (BA) {{which at the time}} was described as the largest-ever freighter investment made by BA with total operating costs of over $1 billion. Porter and Ager-Hanssen controlled 51% of GSS through Riverdon Ltd.|$|R

40|$|The {{benefits}} are assessed of span distributed loading concepts {{as applied to}} future commercial air cargo operations. A two phased program is used to perform this assessment. The first phase consists of selected parametric studies to define significant configuration, performance, and economic trends. The second phase consists of more detailed engineering design, analysis, and economic evaluations to define the technical and economic feasibility of a selected spanloader design. A conventional <b>all-cargo</b> <b>aircraft</b> of comparable technology and size {{is used as a}} comparator system. The technical feasibility is demonstrated of the spanloader concept with no new major technology efforts required to implement the system. However, certain high pay-off technologies such as winglets, airfoil design, and advanced structural materials and manufacturing techniques need refinement and definition prior to application. In addition, further structural design analysis could establish the techniques and criteria necessary to fully capitalize upon the high degree of structural commonality and simplicity inherent in the spanloader concept...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Company {{divested}} of its piston fleet, continued {{to expand its}} turboprop and corporate jet fleet and went into aircraft leasing business. Also, during this period, Mr. Don Wheaton, Sr. became the sole shareholder of Brooker Wheaton Aviation Ltd. During the mid-1980s, the Company began flying for various courier companies. Brooker Aviation Ltd. expanded in this market in subsequent years {{with the addition of}} Fairchild Metroliners and Cessna 208 Caravans. In July 1990, the Company acquired a contract to initially operate two Boeing 727s nationwide for FedEx Express Canada. November 1991 saw the addition of the Fokker F-27 aircraft for the FedEx Express Canada contract. Brooker Wheaton Aviation’s expertise grew substantially in the early 1990s when the Max Ward family purchased half of the company after selling Wardair. At that time the name was changed to Morningstar Express when Don Wheaton Jr. and Kim Ward joined forces. In January 2013, Bill McGoey (President) purchased 25% of the Company. The company has expanded to 14 <b>all-cargo</b> <b>aircraft</b> flying coast-to-coast in scheduled daily cargo service.|$|R
