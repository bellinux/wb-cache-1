It was named Chuqui Norte but they did not develop it, largely because the technology had not been developed, particularly SX/EW. Two smaller areas of interest were found and the overall results showed that the Chuquicamata complex of mineralised porphyries is no less than 14 km long.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to characterize the particle-size distribution and the concentrations of total mercury (HgT), methylmercury (MeHg), and other constituents in sediments trapped behind Daguerre Point Dam, a 28 -foot-high structure on the lower Yuba River in California. The results of the study will assist other agencies in evaluating potential environmen­tal impacts from mobilization of sediments if Daguerre Point Dam is modified or removed to improve the passage of anad­romous fish. Methylmercury is of particular concern owing to its toxicity and propensity to bioaccumulate. A limited amount of recent work on hydraulic and dredge tailings in other watersheds has indicated that mercury and MeHg concentra­tions may be elevated in the fine-grained fractions of placer mining debris, particularly clay and silt. Mercury associated with tailings from placer gold mines is a source of continued contamination in Sierra Nevada watersheds and downstream water bodies, including the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta and the San Francisco Bay of northern California. <b>Churn</b> <b>drilling</b> was used to recover sediments and heavy minerals at 5 -foot intervals from six locations upstream of Daguerre Point Dam. Maximum depth of penetration ranged from 17. 5 to 35 feet below land surface, resulting in 31 dis­creet drilled intervals. Drilling in permeable, unconsolidated sediments below the streambed of the Yuba River released a significant volume of water along with the sediment, which complicated the sampling and characterization effort. Over­flow of a silty fraction sampled at the drill site contained suspended sediment consisting predominantly of silt and clay, with HgT concentration ranging from 33 to 1, 100 ng/g (nanogram per gram) dry weight. A sandy fraction, collected after sieving sediment through a 2 -millimeter vibratory screen, contained from 14 to 82 percent sand and 1 to 29 percent silt plus clay, and had HgT concentrations ranging from 6. 8 to 81 ng/g dry weight. A clay-silt fraction, sampled from material remaining in suspension after the sandy fraction settled for 15 - 20 minutes, contained mercury concentrations from 23 to 370 ng/g dry weight. Concentrations of MeHg were less than the detection limit (Potential rates of mercury methylation and demeth­ylation were evaluated in seven samples using radiotracer methods. Mercury methylation (MeHg production) potentials were generally low, ranging from less than 0. 15 to about 1. 6 ng/g/d (nanogram per gram of dry sediment per day). Mercury demethylation (MeHg degradation) potentials were moderately high, ranging from 1. 0 to 2. 2 ng/g/d. The ratio of methyla­tion potential (MP) to demethylation potential (DP) ranged from less than 0. 14 to about 1. 4 (median = 0. 24, mean = 0. 44, number of samples = 7), suggesting that the potential for net production of MeHg in deep sediments is generally low. The MeHg production rates and MP/DP ratios were higher in the shallower interval in two of the three holes where two depth intervals were assessed, whereas the MeHg concentra­tions were higher in the shallower interval for all three holes. A similar spatial distribution was found for concentrations of solid-phase sulfide (measured as total reduced sulfur and likely representing iron-sulfide and iron-disulfide compounds), which were much higher in shallower samples (about 700 to about 2, 100 nanomoles per gram, dry sediment) than in deeper samples (32 to 55 nanomoles per gram, dry sediment) in these three holes. If reduced sulfur compounds are oxidized to sulfate as a consequence of sediment disturbance, the activ­ity of sulfate-reducing bacteria might be stimulated, caus­ing a short-term increase in methylation of inorganic Hg(II) (divalent mercury). The extent of increased Hg(II) -methylation would depend on the reactivity of the inorganic Hg(II) fraction associated with these sediments, which is currently unknown. The relation between HgT concentration and particle size was evaluated quantitatively using a suite of 15 samples, which were separated into 6 size fractions using screens with the following sieve sizes: 2, 000, 500, 297, 149, 60, and 30 μm (micrometer). A trend toward higher concentrations of mercury in samples having finer particles was observed. This trend is consistent with data obtained for other bulk samples (sandy, silty, and clay-silt fractions), which indicate higher concentrations of mercury associated with larger proportions of clay-size material (less than 4 μm). Heavy-mineral concentrates were prepared to evalu­ate gold concentrations and to make direct observations of elemental mercury and gold-mercury amalgam. Elemental mercury (Hg 0) was observed coating gold and gold-amalgam grains and was isolated {{with the aid of a}} stereo microscope. Using a scanning electron microscope, Hg 0 and mercury-rich gold amalgam were observed on the surfaces of individual gold grains. Spherules of liquid Hg 0 up to 6 μm in diameter were observed in association with platy, aluminosilicate min­erals and iron oxides. In addition to mercury, concentrations of several other trace elements in the fine-grained sediment trapped behind Daguerre Point Dam are of potential environmental concern. Median concentration values of arsenic, chromium, copper, and nickel from 19 sediment samples (screened to less than 0. 060 millimeter) were higher than consensus threshold effects levels for ecological toxicity, and maximum concentrations of lead, mercury, and zinc were also above the threshold effects levels...|$|E

The topic shows growing environmental concern, aiming at removing human operators, unless, possibly, for preliminary in-site set-ups. The prospected solution looks after a goal-oriented robotic rig enabled for tethered wall climbing and equipped for <b>churn</b> <b>drill,</b> boring and cast-in-situ piling. The work-cycle is fully monitored, to provide remote evidence whether tasks are performed the right way and to collect any relevant (basic geology, on-duty remarks, etc.) data, supplying full on-line (with no extra-cost) assessment of the achieved issues. The investigation avails itself of proved technologies and existing fixtures, suitable for compelling requests and dangerous work-conditions {{and is based on}} the collaboration with experts currently engaged for rocky wall consolidation and owners of several patented devices. Hereafter few hints on the overall arrangement are given, to enlighten the climbing motion sweeping out the rocky walls.

40|$|Introduction The {{purpose of}} this survey was to obtain {{information}} concerning existing wells and springs and {{the quantity and quality}} of water they yield, and to put down test holes where additional information was needed. This project was part of a statewide Works Progress Administration project known as a 2 ̆ 2 Statewide Inventory of Water Wells, 2 ̆ 2 sponsored by the [Texas] State Board of Water Engineers. The Division of Ground Water of the United States Geological Survey cooperated in the technical direction of the project and the Bureau of Industrial Chemistry of the University of Texas furnished laboratory space and equipment and supervised the chemical analyses. The analyses were made by chemists employed on Works progress Administration project 6507 - 5112 at Austin, Texas, sponsored by the State Board of Water Engineers. This release was. typed and assembled by typists and draftsmen employed on this project. The field work in Freestone County was started on January 17, 1936, and completed on June 1, 1936. This project was project 2077 of District 5 of the Works Progress Administration, Palestine, Texas. H. L. Chenault, an engineer, was project superintendent. Mr. Chenault deserves credit for his work and for the many extra hours he spent on the project. The Palestine office of the Works Progress Administration made this work possible by their constant help and cooperation. This release contains the well and spring records and well logs obtained by the project superintendent, logs of the test holes drilled by the W. P. A. labor, and the chemical analyses of water from privately owned wells and springs. Locations of all wells and springs listed are shown on the map in the back of the release. The test wells were drilled by W. P. A. labor using a soil auger, drop auger, <b>churn</b> <b>drill,</b> and a sand bucket. Samples were collected at one foot intervals by the well driller in charge of the party. The project superintendent studied these samples and compiled the logs...|$|R
