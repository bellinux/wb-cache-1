50|$|The 3-Hydroxypropionate bicycle, {{also known}} as the 3-Hydroxypropionate pathway, is a process that allows some {{bacteria}} to generate 3-Hydroxypropionate utilizing carbon dioxide. In this pathway CO2 is fixed (i.e. incorporated) by the action of two enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and propionyl-CoA carboxylase. These enzymes generate malonyl-CoA and (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, respectively. Malonyl-CoA, in a series of reactions is further split into acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate. Glyoxylate is incorporated into beta-methylmalyl-coA which is then split, again through a series of reactions to release pyruvate as well as acetate, which is used to replenish the cycle. This pathway has been demonstrated in Chloroflexus, a nonsulfur photosynthetic bacterium, however other studies suggest that 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle is utilized by several <b>chemotrophic</b> archaea.|$|E

Chemoautotrophs generally fall into several groups: methanogens, halophiles, sulfur oxidizers and reducers, nitrifiers, anammox bacteria, and thermoacidophiles.

The differentiated olfactory sensory neurons extend pioneering axons, which follow guidance cues released by the underlying mesenchyme, as well as other <b>chemotrophic</b> cues released from the telencephalon. As development of the olfactory pathway progresses, more axons innervate the olfactory bulb, which develops from the rostral-most region of telencephalon.

Some species of Thermococcus are immobile, and some species have motility, using flagella as their main source of movement. These flagella typically exist at a specific pole of the organism. This movement has been seen at room temperature or at high temperature, depending on the specific organism. In some species, these microorganisms can aggregate and form white-gray plaques, while all of these organisms dwell in temperatures from 70-<100oC, either in the presence of black smokers (hydrothermal vents), or freshwater springs, [...] amongst salt (NaCl) concentrations of 1%-3%. Species in this genus are strictly anaerobes, and most are barophiles as well as thermophiles, living in depths between 200-<1000 ft. These organisms thrive at pH levels of 5.6-7.9. Members of this genus have been found in many hydrothermal vent systems in the world, including from the seas of Japan, to off the coasts of California. Surprisingly salt (NaCl) is not a required substrate for these organisms, as one study showed Thermococcus members living in fresh hot water systems in New Zealand, however they do require a low concentration of lithium ion for growth.
