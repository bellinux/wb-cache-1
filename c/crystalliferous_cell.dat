40|$|Tropical {{hard wood}} species written at TABLE 1, mainly from East-South Asia, were {{examined}} with light microscope, {{scanning electron microscope}} and by the ashing method. Woods were maintained at the Laboratory of Wood Science, Kyushu University and used as experimental materials. Results were revealed the fundamental information of wood identification listed up in TABLE 2 and others as follows: 1) Cell inclusives founded by light microscope and electron microscope were different but these were attributable to treatment methods. 2) Ashing method was useful to examine the presence of crystal in cell and to test the chemical reaction which indicates silica or calcium salt. 3) Generally wood contained different shapes of crystal in ray parenchyma and axial parenchyma. Sometimes same tissue contained a few kinds of crystal shape. 4) The crystal presenting in parenchyma was an important key for identification of experimental woods. 5) The species belonging to the DIPTEROCARPACEAE possessed the vertical intercellular canal but in other species, they were absent. 6) Jongkong and Rengas possessed the radial intercellular canal. Rose wood and Jelutong possessed the laticifer. <b>Crystalliferous</b> <b>cell</b> did not present in Jongkong and Jelutong. 7) In Ramin, Durian, Rose Wood, Yellow Meranti and Kapur, <b>crystalliferous</b> <b>cell</b> presented in both tissues of axial parenchyma and ray parenchyma...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on a {{comparative}} study regarding shoot morphology and anatomy of two climbing rose cultivars, from the Botanic Garden of Iasi: ‘Ilse Krohn Superior’ and ‘Sympathie’. The shoot presents a thick collenchymatized cortex, which bears <b>crystalliferous</b> <b>cells</b> as macles and ursins of calcium oxalate. The foliar limb is hypostomatic in both cultivars, with bifacial-heterofacial structure. In our analysis, we evidenced a better adaptation to {{the conditions of the}} Botanic Garden in ‘Ilse Krohn Superior’ in comparison with ‘Sympathie’ which is more sensible. Nevertheless, the dimension of the mesophyll and the presence of the <b>crystalliferous</b> <b>cells</b> are indicators of the photosynthetic biologic activity and of the durability of the shoots and, in conclusion, both cultivars develop very well in their locations...|$|R
40|$|Cell wall {{development}} of chambered <b>crystalliferous</b> <b>cells</b> {{in the secondary}} phloem of Populus euramericana is described. These cells were differentiated from parenchyma strands which contacted with phloem fiber groups. A crystal was formed in a vacuole surrounded by tonoplast in each chamber. Then, the secondary wall deposition of chambered <b>crystalliferous</b> <b>cells</b> began only at the part adjacent to phloem fibers forming a protruding fringe which encircled the crystal. When the vacuole disappeared, the crystal had been surrounded by the wall substance on all sides except that away from the fiber. The wall on the crystal surface was not formed by the growth of any protrusion of the secondary wall, but formed independently by the deposition of wall substance on the crystal surface. The secondary wall development was completed after filling up {{the space between the}} crystal-surface wall and the thickened side wall adjacent to phloem fiber with newly deposited wall. The crystal-surface wall must be deposited after the tonoplast surrounding the crystal is converted into the plasma membrane多室結晶細胞は分化中の師部繊維に接する柔細胞ストランドから分化した。結晶は最初液胞中に認められた。師部繊維が二次壁の堆積を始める頃, 結晶細胞壁の師部繊維側の部分で二次壁形成が始まり, 結晶を取巻くように壁の突出部が形成された。結晶を取囲む液胞が見えなくなると, 師部繊維と反対側の面を除きすべての結晶表面に壁の堆積が起こった。しかし, この壁は結晶細胞の壁の突出部が張出してきて結晶表面を被ったものではなかった。最後に結晶表面の壁と結晶細胞の師部繊維側に堆積した二次壁との間が, 新たに堆積してきた壁物質によって埋められ, 結晶は厚い細胞壁中に取込まれた状態となる。結晶表面の壁は, 結晶を取囲んでいた液胞膜が原形質膜に置換えられた後に形成されたものと考えられる...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{investigate}} {{the structure of}} the aerial vegetative organs of 2 species and 7 varieties of Rhododendron. The anatomical features of the analyzed taxons which could be useful in determination of the unflowered plants are underlined. The histo-anatomical featured with taxonomical value are: the shape, dimension and frequency of the hairs (tector and secretor), the presence or the absence of the <b>crystalliferous</b> <b>cells,</b> the thickness of the palisade parenchyma. Between the histoanatomical features with ecological signification - the xylem vessels diameter, the vesicular cells from leaf epidermis and thick cuticle, covered by wax - could be mentioned...|$|R
40|$|Many {{species of}} Myrtaceae, {{including}} Plinia edulis (Vell.) Sobral (cambucá), have pharmacological properties {{and are used}} as hypoglycemiants and therapeutic agents against stomach problems and throat infections. Samples were collected from Tijuca Forest in Rio de Janeiro, and the morpho-anatomical data were compared with other specimens obtained from Trindade, Paraty, found in the literature. Variations in leaf anatomy were observed, and the possible causes for these effects are discussed. The plant material collected from Tijuca Forest was analyzed using scanning electron and optical microscopy. Histochemical tests were applied to identify starch, lipids, phenolic compounds and lignin. The epidermal cells exhibit straight or slightly sinuous anticlinal walls covered by a smooth cuticle with granules of wax. Simple trichomes are restricted to the midrib region, and paracytic stomata are only observed on the abaxial leaf surface. The mesophyll is dorsiventral, with conspicuous intercellular spaces in the spongy parenchyma. Intercalated columns of <b>crystalliferous</b> <b>cells</b> and subepidermal secretory cavities are observed in the single layer of palisade parenchyma. The samples obtained from Trindade, Paraty, show larger leaves, anomocytic stomata and trichomes scattered throughout the leaf surface. This plasticity might reflect leaf adaptations to environmental factors or different stages of leaf development...|$|R
40|$|Leaf {{anatomical}} {{changes of}} Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lamk seedlings grown in experimental equipment that simulated semidiurnal tides with salinities of 15 parts per thousand under greenhouse conditions were studied. Compared with the 0 h treatments, leaf thickness, palisade parenchyma thickness, spongy parenchyma thickness, palisade-spongy thickness ratio, xylem {{length of the}} vascular system and number of vessels and vessel lines under the 12 It treatments declined 31. 9 %, 59. 1 %, 21. 7 %, 47. 1 %, 48. 9 %, 67. 1 % and 51. 6 %, respectively. However, {{the upper and lower}} epidermis to leaf thickness ratio, upper and lower hypodermis to leaf thickness ratio and stomatal density of 12 h treatments showed increases of 47. 9 %, 50. 9 %, 14. 3 %, 21. 4 % and 104. 3 % over those of 0 h treatments, respectively. The cuticle to leaf thickness ratio (inundated for 0 - 6 h) decreased significantly with waterlogging duration at first and then increased. Moreover, the percentage of intercellular spaces in spongy tissue decreased from 4 to 10 h treatment and then tended to increase by nearly 20 % in the 12 h treatment. Tannin cells that were distributed in the vascular tissue, <b>crystalliferous</b> <b>cells</b> and phloem fibers were more abundant in the short-duration waterlogging treatments than in the long-duration waterlogging treatment. It was concluded that significant changes in the leaf anatomical features as a result of periods of immersion would have come at the cost of reduction of photosynthesis and water transport when waterlogging duration was longer than 2 h. These anatomical characteristics further proved that B. gymnorrhiza had a relatively low tolerance to waterlogging at the seedling stage. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The wood {{structure}} of 71 species representing 24 genera of the pantropical Lecythidaceae s. l., including the edible Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa) and the spectacular cannon-ball tree (Couroupita guianensis), was investigated using light and scanning electron microscopy. This {{study focused on}} finding phylogenetically informative characters to help elucidate any obscure evolutionary patterns within the family. The earliest diverging subfamily Napoleonaeoideae has mixed simple/scalariform vessel perforations, scalariform vessel-ray pitting, and high multiseriate rays, all features that are also present in Scytopetaloideae. The wood {{structure of}} Napoleonaea is distinct, but its supposed close relative Crateranthus strongly resembles Scytopetaloideae. The isolated position of Foetidia (Foetidioideae) can be supported by a unique type of vessel-ray pitting that is similar in shape and size to intervessel pitting (distinctly bordered,, 5 lm). The more derived Planchonioideae and Lecythidoideae share exclusively simple perforations and two types of vessel-ray pitting, but they can easily be distinguished from each other {{by the size of}} intervessel pitting, shape of body ray cells in multiseriate rays, and the type of <b>crystalliferous</b> axial parenchyma <b>cells.</b> The anatomical diversity observed is clearly correlated with differences in plant size (shrubs vs. tall trees) : the percentage of scalariform perforations, as well as vessel density, and the length of vessel elements, fibers, and multiseriate rays are negatively correlated with increasing plant size, while the reverse is true for vessel diameter. status: publishe...|$|R
