40|$|Acoustic {{resonances}} in combustion {{systems like}} <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>boilers</b> prohibit further technological advances in these systems. The {{design and construction}} is obstructed by acoustic problems because they are largely misunderstood. The flame often acts as an active element in the acoustic field, because the flame transfer function of acoustic waves has a large amplitude at low frequencies. Current models of the phase of the flame transfer function of Bunsen-type flames, based on kinematic behavior of the flame dynamics, completely miss the experimentally observed phase, unless the measured flow field {{is used in the}} model. In the current paper we analyze numerical results of the flame dynamics, flow field and flame transfer function found with a 2 D detailed numerical model of the flow and structure of the flame on a multiple-slit burner. The model is validated with experiments of the flame dynamics (using chemiluminescence), flow dynamics (using PIV) and flame transfer function (using OH luminescence for the heat release fluctuations and heated wire probe for the acoustic distortions) on exactly the same configuration. A very good agreement is found which indicates the importance of predicting all the influences of the flow on the flame and vise-versa...|$|R

The second part can be obtained from small new sources (for inhabited localities that do not have a centralized heat supply infrastructure). New indicators complement the system of indicators to be used to analyze and monitoring the level of Moldova's energy security.

40|$|The {{response}} of burner-stabilized flat flames to acoustic velocity perturbations is studied numerically and analytically. The numerical setup involves {{the set of}} one-dimensional transport equations for the low-Mach number reacting flow using a simple and a more complex reaction mechanism. The physical background of the phenomena observed numerically is explained by a simple analytical model. The model uncouples the unsteady transport equations into two parts: the first part describes the flame motion through the G-equation and the second flamelet part describes the inner flame structure and mass burning rate of the flame. The G-equation can be solved exactly {{in the case of}} a quasi-steady flame structure. The mass burning rate is assumed to be directly related to the flame temperature. Relations for the fluctuating heat release and heat loss to the burner are derived, from which the coupling between the velocity fluctuations at both sides of the flame is found. Comparison of the numerical and analytical results with earlier work of McIntosh and with primary experimental results on a lean methane/air flame shows the validity of the models. The origin of the differences encountered is discussed. The resulting transfer function for the velocity perturbation can be applied to the acoustic stability analysis of combustion systems. The most interesting application is the acoustic behaviour of <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>boilers...</b>|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of smart {{thermostats}} like Toon®, detailed information about operation and usage of <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>boilers</b> has become easily available. However, this information is not used in a systematic way by most companies including Eneco, and the wealth of information within is not available to the users. This has a few drawbacks. For instance, when a mechanic is sent to repair a broken boiler, the mechanic has {{to rely on the}} data provided by the callcenter receiving the call from the customer. This data is often missing, incomplete or incorrect. This means that no reliable information about which parts to bring and how long the repair will take is available a priori. Secondly, some malfunctions could have been easily resolved by the end-user, for instance by refilling the system with water. This research aims to provide a starting point in a systematic and automated approach in analysing the behaviour of the boiler by detecting malfunctions as they occur. To do so, a mathematical model of a house is designed. On this model an Extended Kalman Filter is built which monitors important parameters of the system in real-time. The estimated parameters can in future research be used as features in a more complete fault detection and identification scheme. The filter has successfully been tested against simulated faults, and shows promising results when applied to real data.

40|$|Energy {{use in the}} {{domestic}} sector represents {{a large portion of}} the primary energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. Highly distributed energy systems, employing various micro-generators, may be able to reduce domestic energy demand and CO 2 from this sector. Very small 'combined heat and power' (CHP) systems are one class of microgenerator that can supply heat and power to a single residential home at significantly increased efficiency and reduced carbon emissions compared with separate supply. Such systems are known as micro-CHP (mCHP) or domestic-CHP (DCHP) in the United Kingdom, and are used to replace <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>boilers</b> typically installed in houses. The relative merits of three alternative network-connected mCHP plants have been evaluated; based respectively on an internal combustion engine (IC), a Stirling engine, and a fuel cell. Each of the systems varies in terms of their power generation efficiencies, and supply differing proportions of electricity and heat. They are consequently suitable for various housing types and sizes. All these mCHP plants employ natural gas as the fuel input. The use of any of the three systems will result in lower CO 2 emissions (relative to those from the most efficient condensing boilers) -about 450 kg for every thousand hours used in the case of a Stirling engine based system installed in a reasonably well insulated home. They also lead to energy-cost savings for the consumer, up to £ 46 per MWh (a 61 % saving on conventional energy supplies) depending on house type. However, their capital costs are at present more expensive than a conventional boiler, with the fuel cell being prohibitively so. The IC and Stirling engine variants are shown to display the greatest economic and environmental benefit...|$|R
30|$|As already {{mentioned}} {{in a lot}} of instances, the [1] report estimates that around 40 % of the world’s final energy is used for residential buildings. The building sector plays a large role in the energy consumption which includes space heating or cooling, domestic hot water and electricity. Buildings with their long lifespan and huge amount of already existing buildings, makes revision in energy characteristics of a building constrained. In many countries, new buildings could be made 70 % more efficient than existing buildings [2]. According to [3], the annual rate of new building construction is always higher than the demolition rate. In contrary to the energy policies’ aims of reducing the energy consumption, the energy demand in residential sector has increased by 15 % in the last decade in UK [4]. Global energy consumption in the residential sector grows on average at 1 % per year [2]. Energy use in the buildings sector follows a trend which increases it by 88 % between 2003 and 2050, or 1.4 % per year [2]. A whopping 50 % of residential sector demand is used for space heating in IEA countries and this is expected to be around 70 % for countries such as Germany and Poland [1]. The second major energy demand for residential sector is the electricity. Electricity consumption increases at 2.5 % per year, raising its share in the buildings sector from 24 % in 2003 to estimated 40 % in 2050 [2, p. 200]. Half of all energy saving potential in the residential sector could be from space heating [2]. Water heating also accounts for about 16 % of total energy savings in the future [2]. Accordingly, the most effective energy conservation measures are the insulation of external walls (33 – 60 % energy savings), weather proofing of openings (16 – 21 %), the installation of double-glazed windows (14 – 20 %), the regular maintenance of <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>boilers</b> (10 – 12 %), and the installation of solar collectors for sanitary hot water production (50 – 80 %) [5].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{theoretical}} and experimental aspects concerning the typical bubble shape at the flow {{line of a}} standard domestic central heating system are investigated. This is done {{in support of the}} on-going research on two-phase flows in domestic central heating systems. Bubble nucleation and detachment at the primary heat exchanger wall of a domestic <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>boiler</b> results in a bubbly two-phase flow in the system pipe work. Bubbly flow results in undesired cold spots at higher points in the system, consequently diminishing system performance. An experimental analysis was done on the bubble shape at the exit of the boiler through the application of photographic techniques. The results are presented in terms of the measured bubble aspect ratios at some principal system operating conditions. The dimensionless Eotvos and bubble Reynolds number were calculated and tabulated with the measured mean diameters. The data was subsequently correlated to the bubble shape regime diagram. Results suggest that most bubbles are quasi-spherical in shape with a noticeable elongation at lower bulk fluid Reynolds numbers. ...|$|E
