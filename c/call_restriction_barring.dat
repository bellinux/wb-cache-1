40|$|Sequential {{financing}} is {{a popular}} strategy in corporate finance. However, {{depending on the type}} of financial instrument used to carry out the strategy, sequential financing can have many potential problems. This paper shows that certain types of convertibles can be deployed to resolve the problems completely. This may explain why convertibles are widely adopted to implement sequential financing in reality, especially among companies with many real options. We find that the call feature and some popular <b>call</b> <b>restrictions</b> are necessary for an efficient convertible. Indeed, almost all real-world convertibles have a call feature and <b>call</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

50|$|Musgrave Park {{is home to}} the Jagera Arts Centre {{and is one of the}} few {{remaining}} green spaces left in Brisbane's inner city. On 24 August 1998, after twenty years of legal struggles with the Queensland state government, the Musgrave Park Aboriginal Corporation (MPAC) secured a lease to build a cultural centre on portions of the park. The park holds special significance to the local indigenous population due to a past <b>restriction</b> <b>barring</b> Aborigines from crossing the park and entering the city of Brisbane. Notably, being the site of a buried bora ring, it has historically been a sacred site to the native Murri people.|$|R
50|$|In {{a similar}} manner, {{restriction}} enzymes {{are used to}} digest genomic DNA for gene analysis by Southern blot. This technique allows researchers to identify how many copies (or paralogues) of a gene {{are present in the}} genome of one individual, or how many gene mutations (polymorphisms) have occurred within a population. The latter example is <b>called</b> <b>restriction</b> fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).|$|R

A final <b>restriction</b> <b>bars</b> an individual convicted of high treason from sitting in the House of Lords until completing his or her full term of imprisonment. An exception applies, however, if the individual convicted of high treason receives a full pardon. Note that an individual serving a prison sentence for an offence other than high treason is not automatically disqualified.|$|R

50|$|Alternatively, the BAC library can be restriction-digested. Two clones {{that have}} several {{fragment}} sizes in common are inferred to overlap because they contain multiple similarly spaced restriction sites in common. This method of genomic mapping is <b>called</b> <b>restriction</b> fingerprinting because it identifies {{a set of}} restriction sites contained in each clone. Once the overlap between the clones has been found and their order relative to the genome known, a scaffold of a minimal subset of these contigs that covers the entire genome is shotgun-sequenced.|$|R

RFLP also aids in the identification of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene which is predictive of an adult-onset autosomal disorder called Huntington's disease (HD). Mutations in chromosome 4 are able to be visualized when RFLP is used in conjunction with Southern blot analysis.|$|R

5000|$|This enzymatic {{technique}} can be {{used for}} cleaving DNA molecules at specific sites, ensuring that all DNA fragments that contain a particular sequence at a particular location have the same size; furthermore, each fragment that contains the desired sequence has the sequence located at exactly the same position within the fragment.

These enzymes are <b>called</b> <b>restriction</b> endonucleases or restriction enzymes, and they are able to cleave DNA molecules at the positions at which particular short sequences of bases are present.|$|R

50|$|A {{restriction}} fragment is a DNA fragment {{resulting from the}} cutting of a DNA strand by a restriction enzyme (restriction endonucleases), a process <b>called</b> <b>restriction.</b> Each restriction enzyme is highly specific, recognising a particular short DNA sequence, or restriction site, and cutting both DNA strands at specific points within this site. Most restriction sites are palindromic, (the sequence of nucleotides is the same on both strands when read in the 5' to 3' direction), and are four to eight nucleotides long. Many cuts are made by one restriction enzyme because of the chance repetition of these sequences in a long DNA molecule, yielding a set of {{restriction fragment}}s. A particular DNA molecule will always yield {{the same set of}} restriction fragments when exposed to the same restriction enzyme. Restriction fragments can be analyzed using techniques such as gel electrophoresis or used in recombinant DNA technology.|$|R
