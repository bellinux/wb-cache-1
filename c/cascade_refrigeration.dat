40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The {{investigations}} {{focus on}} load shifting, load clipping and energy efficiency through control strategies. Load shifting {{is achieved by}} {{increasing the amount of}} work done in the Eskom non-peak period. This then results in a decrease in the Eskom peak time work load. The mine refrigeration system is modelled and verified with the data. A simulation is made from the model and the simulation is used to develop the new control strategy and new operational parameters. Predicted results are verified to be within production operational constraints. A case study was carried out to prove the effectiveness of the newly developed control strategy and operational parameters. Firstly the <b>cascade</b> mine surface <b>refrigeration</b> system is automated to allow remote viewing and control of the system from a central point. The control strategy is tested through implementation on automated mine refrigeration systems. The real-time energy management system (REMS) is set up and the communication with the SCADA is tested through observing dam level temperatures and stopping and starting refrigeration machines. The decisions the controllers make are monitored until the system is fully automated. The results of the new control system on the flows, temperatures, dam levels, thermal energy and electrical energy are validated and verified. An assessment of the case study proved that DSM can be done on <b>cascade</b> mine <b>refrigeration</b> systems. A 4. 2 MW load shift was predicted and research found an over performance of 0. 3 MW. It is clear from the results that utilising the thermal storage in <b>cascade</b> mine surface <b>refrigeration</b> systems, will allow DSM load shifting.

40|$|Olefins Plants show an {{intrinsic}} {{cost of the}} energy demand which derives from Process and Plant design. Few innovative changes have been implemented in the past decades. Such changes were mainly directed to increasing the throughput of the plant and its flexibility rather than to provide reduction on energy costs per unit of product. Looking at Olefins Plants from a different sight, i. e. the innovation of processes configuration and technologies, they offer a wide temperature interval which ranges from 800 - 850 degrees Celsius at the coils outlet to minus 125 - 130 degrees in the cold-box; pressure may rise up to 30 bar; standard process productions quote 500. 000 tons per year of ethylene. These figures put these plants in the ideal condition of being considered as an effective benchmark for all those research activities of approaching the energy efficiency problems {{by means of the}} adoption of new technologies or new process configurations. The process under study is a typical olefin plant that produces ethylene by thermal cracking of hydrocabons. This method proceeds by a free radical mechanism including initiation, propagation, and termination steps. The thermal cracking generates several valuable by-products including methane, propylene, butadiene, benzene, [...] . and also fuel oil and tar. These products are usually separated by a set of distillations at low temperature (down to about 100 K) and high pressure in order to separate the products with an acceptable purity. For low pressure plants, the low temperature is achieved in a cold box using a complex refrigeration system with three <b>cascaded</b> <b>refrigeration</b> cycles using methane, ethylene and propylene. The methane refrigeration system works between 136 K and 180 K : it is a classical system with one evaporator and one condenser. The ethylene refrigeration system operates between 172 K and 243 K: it includes three pressure levels. The propylene cycle works between 233 K and 319 K and includes 4 pressure levels. These three systems are linked to each other through their condensers: methane condenser is cooled by ethylene shich in turn is cooled by propylene and finally, cooling water is used to condense propylene. The goal {{of the study was to}} develop a method to help in identifying the process modifications required to reduce the energy consumption of the cold box and to maximize the efficiency of the integrated refrigeration system. Energy integration techniques have been used to target the minimum energy requirement of the process and to characterize the refrigeration system required. If the heat cascade and the corresponding composite curves (e. g. figure 2) give an indication of the refrigeration requirement of the process including all the possible heat recovery exchangers to be considered in the system, it does not give a proper answer to the definition of refrigeration requirement target. This is because, the energy requirement is expressed in terms of mechanical power required in the refrigeration rather than in terms of thermal energy. There was therefore a need for a tool able to target as well the optimal integration of the refrigeration system. The retrofit and the optimal integration of refrigeration systems is a complex task due to a large number of degrees of freedom. To solve such problem, the combined use of process modelling, optimisation based energy integration techniques and graphical representations appear to be a very useful tool. The goal of this paper is to illustrate the application of such tools to retrofit the cold box of an olefin plant...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{microprocessor}} performance can be improved by lowering the junction temperature. Two stage <b>cascaded</b> vapor compression <b>refrigeration</b> (VCR) is a mature, inexpensive, and reliable cooling technology that can offer chip temperatures down to ?? C. Recent studies have shown that for a power limited computer chip, there is a non-linear scaling effect that offers a 4. 3 X performance enhancement at ?? C. The heat transfer performance of a compact evaporator is often the bottleneck in sub-ambient heat removal. For this reason, the design of a deep sub-ambient compact evaporator is critical to the cooling system performance and has not been addressed in the literature. Four compact evaporator designs were investigated as feasible designs - a baseline case with no enhancement structures, micro channels, inline pin fin arrays, and alternating pin fin arrays. A parametric experimental investigation of four compact evaporator designs has been performed aiming at enhancing heat transfer. Each evaporator consists of oxygen free copper and has a footprint of 20 mm x 36 mm, with a total thickness of 3. 1 mm. The micro channel evaporator contains 13 channels that are 400 um wide by 1. 2 mm deep, and the pin fin evaporators contain approximately 80 pin fins that are 400 um wide by 1. 2 mm tall with a pitch of 800 um. Two phase convective boiling of R 508 b refrigerant was investigated in each evaporator at flow rates of 50 - 70 g/min and saturation temperatures of ??to ??C. Pressure drop and local heat transfer measurements are reported and used to explain the performance of the various evaporator geometries. The results are compared to predictions from popular macro- and micro-channel heat transfer and pressure drop correlations.

Recently, such compressors, whose maximum of discharging pressure is 5. 3 MPa, are also adopted in high temperature NH 3 heat pumps and NH 3 /CO 2 <b>cascade</b> <b>refrigeration</b> system. However, high pressure twin screw compressors are required to have large capacity, good performance and excellent stability at high operating pressure. In this paper, a semi-empirical model for open-type high pressure twin screw compressor is developed. Experimental research is conducted for identification of parameters, while validation is also made on {{the accuracy of the}} model. On the basis of theoretical and experimental research, the performance of the compressor, which includes volumetric efficiency, adiabatic efficiency, discharge temperature and lubricant oil flow rate/temperature, are illustrated. The change pattern of such features on the operating conditions, slide valve loadings and ambient features are then analyzed. Additionally, the stability test results of the high pressure twin screw compressor including the vibration and noise are also shown...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a CO 2 /NH 3 <b>cascade</b> <b>refrigeration</b> system is modeled and {{analyzed}} from exergetic, {{economic and environmental}} points of view. In the next step, multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithm method is employed to achieve the optimal design parameters of the system. The exergetic efﬁciency and the total cost rate of the system (including the capital and maintenance costs, operational cost, and social cost of CO 2 emission) {{are taken into account}} as objective functions. A set of optimal solutions is achieved and a ﬁnal optimum point is then chosen using TOPSIS decision-making method. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to study the effect of variation of the unit cost of electricity on the achieved optimal solutions. While operating at the achieved optimum design, the variation of the exergy destruction of each component and the whole system due to the change in the cooling load has also been investigated. The optimization results demonstrate that for the considered plant with cooling capacity of 50 kW, the optimum design selected from the Pareto front results in exergetic efﬁciency of 45. 89...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a performance study on a low-temperature absorption-compression <b>cascade</b> <b>refrigeration</b> system (LACRS), {{which consists of}} an absorption subsystem (AS) and a vapor compression auto-cascade subsystem (CS). In the system, low-grade heat of AS is used to subcool the CS, which can obtain cold energy at - 170 °C. A simulation study is carried out to investigate the effects of evaporating temperature and low-grade cooling capacity on system performance. The study results show that as low-grade cooling capacity from the AS is provided to the CS, high-grade cooling capacity increases, compressor power consumption decreases, and the COP of the CS therefore increases. Comparing with compression auto-cascade cycle, the largest COP improvement of LACRS is about 38 %. The model is verified by experimental data. An additional high-grade cooling capacity is obtained experimentally at - 170 °C. The study results {{presented in this paper}} not only demonstrate the excellent performance of the LACRS, but also provide important guidance to further system design, and practical application.
