5|$|Polyols, {{compounds}} containing {{more than}} one alcohol functional group, generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars. Specifically, using Benedict's reagent and Fehling's solution {{the presence of the}} sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose. Amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for <b>copper</b> <b>ions</b> exist, one involving potassium ferrocyanide, which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.|$|E

Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically {{in the treatment of}} copper toxicosis in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, potentially by inhibiting the membrane translocation process that is dependent on <b>copper</b> <b>ions.</b> This is a promising avenue for investigation of treatments for cancer, age-related macular degeneration, and other diseases that involve a pathologic proliferation of blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{typically}} use {{the color}} green as camouflage, blending {{in with the}} chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment. Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also {{be affected by the}} surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries <b>copper</b> <b>ions</b> in chelation.|$|E

Nevertheless, <b>copper</b> <b>ion</b> at higher concentrations (0.1 and 0.5 mM) decreased PPO activity (P < 0.05). The result was in accordance with Benjakul et al. ([2005]) who reported a decrease in activity of PPO from kuruma prawn with increasing concentrations of <b>copper</b> <b>ion.</b> On the other hand, PPO from white shrimp (Simpson et al. [1987]) and lobster (Opoku-Gyamfua et al. [1992]) had an increased activity with increasing concentrations of <b>copper</b> <b>ion.</b> The increase in <b>copper</b> <b>ion</b> might cause the conformational change of the enzyme by affecting the ionic interaction stabilising the structure of the enzyme (Benjakul et al. [2005]). It was noted that PPO activity from Pacific white shrimp was decreased by the higher concentration of copper acetate. In general, trypsin and <b>copper</b> <b>ion</b> have been reported to be activators of PPO from different sources. The result suggested that PPO in DEAE-Sephacel fraction was in an active state and did not require trypsin or <b>copper</b> <b>ion</b> as activators. Also, the structure or conformation of PPO from Pacific white shrimp might be different from that of PPO from other species. Therefore, activation of PPO by trypsin or <b>copper</b> <b>ion</b> depends on the species and other intrinsic factors determining the activity.|$|R

This study demonstrates that <b>copper</b> <b>ion</b> (Cu(II) or Cu(II) plus hydroxylamine (HA) to produce Cu(I)) in combination with norspermidine (Nspd) can effectively inactivate bacterial biofilms on RO membranes. The addition of Nspd inhibited the inactivation of planktonic P. aeruginosa cells by <b>copper</b> <b>ion.</b> However, with respect to the cells in biofilms (grown in CDC reactors), the use of Nspd enhanced the cell inactivation by copper ion; the addition of Nspd increased the inactivation efficacies of Cu(II) and Cu(Il) /HA against biofilm cells from 2. 4 to 3. 1 and from 1. 3 to 3. 5 (log inactivation in 1 h), respectively. Nspd disrupted extracellular polymeric substances (as evidenced by the removal of proteins and polysaccharides from biofilms), and it is believed to facilitate the penetration of <b>copper</b> <b>ion</b> into the biofilm matrix.

40|$|Copper {{toxicity}} to unicellular {{green algae}} Chlorella vulgaris {{has been investigated}} by studying its effect on various physiological processes. A concentration dependent reduction on growth rate, cell size, fluorescence activity, photosynthetic rate, nutrient utilization (NO 3 - & PO 43 -), protein synthesis and nitrate reductase activities was observed in different <b>copper</b> <b>ion</b> concentrations. A <b>copper</b> concentration of 6 ppm provoked about 50 % growth reduction (EC 50) which can be truly reflected by the induced lag period and retardation in the growth pattern and specific growth rate. Above the EC 50 concentration, normal cell division, fluorescence activity and photosynthetic rate were seriously inhibited, these seems to the most important points of copper toxicity. Nutrient utilization was also affected by the <b>copper</b> <b>ion,</b> a 50 % and 80 % reduction in nitrate ion uptake was observed at 6 ppm and 8 ppm copper concentration, respectively.

Chlorella cells were found to remove more than 35 % of the <b>copper</b> <b>ion</b> from the culture medium followed by bio-accumulation inside the cells. This <b>copper</b> <b>ion</b> accumulation ability was also dependent on the external <b>copper</b> <b>ion</b> concentration. A higher copper concentration usually resulted in a large quantity of metal adsorption. The adsorption patterns were found to followed both the classical Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms.

Under appropriate copper stress, the acid soluble thiols content in the algal cells was found to increase drastically, whereas the cellular glutathione and cysteine content decreased proportionally. This implied that phytochelatin like metal binding complex was actively bio-synthesized from glutathione and cysteine. On the other hand, the induction of metal binding complex resulted in the increase amount of acid soluble thiols. Chromatographic fractionation using gel filtration liquid chromatography, ion exchange fast protein filtration liquid chromatography, and reverse-phase high performance filtration liquid chromatography revealed the presence of the copper-binding complex with low molecular mass of about 2, 300 daltons.

25|$|Researchers have {{attributed}} copper’s {{resistance to}} biofouling, even in temperate waters, to two possible mechanisms: 1) a retarding sequence of colonization through release of antimicrobial <b>copper</b> <b>ions,</b> thereby preventing the attachment of microbial layers to marine surfaces; and, 2) separating layers that contain corrosive products and the spores of juveniles or macro-encrusting organisms.|$|E
25|$|Electrotyping is {{activated}} by electric currents that flow between anode wires {{that are also}} immersed in the solution and the wire connected to the coated mold (the cathode). For copper electrotyping, a typical aqueous electrolyte contains copper sulfate (CuSO4) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and the anode is also copper; the arrangement is illustrated in the figure. The electric current causes copper atoms to dissolve from the anode's surface and to enter the electrolyte as <b>copper</b> <b>ions</b> (Cu++ in the figure). <b>Copper</b> <b>ions</b> are {{taken up by the}} mold's conducting surface at the same rate at which copper dissolves from the anode, thus completing the electrical circuit. When the copper layer on the mold grows to the desired thickness, the electric current is stopped. The mold and its attached electrotype are removed from the solution, and the electrotype and the mold are separated. An animation of the electrotyping process was produced in 2011 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

25|$|Exchange {{interactions}} {{occur when}} the substance is not magnetically dilute and there are interactions between individual magnetic centres. One of the simplest systems to exhibit the result of exchange interactions is crystalline copper(II) acetate, Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2. As the formula indicates, it contains two copper(II) ions. The Cu2+ ions are held together by four acetate ligands, each of which binds to both <b>copper</b> <b>ions.</b> Each Cu2+ ion has a d9 electronic configuration, and so should have one unpaired electron. If there were a covalent bond between the <b>copper</b> <b>ions,</b> the electrons would pair up and the compound would be diamagnetic. Instead, there is an exchange interaction in which the spins of the unpaired electrons become partially aligned to each other. In fact two states are created, one with spins parallel {{and the other with}} spins opposed. The energy difference between the two states is so small their populations vary significantly with temperature. In consequence the magnetic moment varies with temperature in a sigmoidal pattern. The state with spins opposed has lower energy, so the interaction can be classed as antiferromagnetic in this case. It is believed that {{this is an example of}} superexchange, mediated by the oxygen and carbon atoms of the acetate ligands. Other dimers and clusters exhibit exchange behaviour.|$|E

Unlined copper is also used in the making of preserves, jams and jellies. Copper does not store ("bank") heat, and so thermal flows reverse almost immediately upon removal from heat. This allows precise control of consistency and texture while cooking sugar and pectin-thickened preparations. Alone, fruit acid would be sufficient to cause leaching of copper byproducts, but naturally occurring fruit sugars and added preserving sugars buffer copper reactivity. Unlined pans have thereby been used safely in such applications for centuries.|$|E
