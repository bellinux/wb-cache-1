25|$|Meanwhile, von Furst {{is aware}} that his wife still has strong {{feelings}} for Gibby. He sabotages the aircraft Gibby is to fly for a dangerous stunt, secretly applying acid to a <b>control</b> <b>wire,</b> not only out of jealousy, but also {{to add to the}} realism of his film with a real crash. However, unbeknownst to him, Woody decides to do the stunt in Gibby's place. Red sees von Furst tampering with the wires and alerts Gibby. Gibby takes off in another aircraft and catches up to Woody, but cannot make himself understood over the roar of their engines. The cable breaks, and Woody crashes and is killed.|$|E
500|$|Due {{to their}} low weight {{and the fact}} that they had only one <b>control</b> <b>wire</b> per leg, the puppets were unable to walk convincingly. Therefore, scenes {{involving}} movement were filmed from the waist up, with a puppeteer holding the legs below the level of the camera and using a [...] "bobbing" [...] action to simulate motion. Alternatively, dynamic shots were eliminated altogether: in an interview with New Scientist, director of photography John Read spoke of the advantages of circumventing the lack of agility so that the puppets [...] "appear, for example, to walk through doors (although the control wires make this impossible) or pick up a coffee cup (although their fingers are not in fact jointed)." [...] Live-action shots of human hands were inserted whenever scripts called for more dexterous actions to be performed.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1906, de Forest made a {{breakthrough}} when he reconfigured the control electrode, changing it {{from outside the}} glass to a zig-zag wire inside the tube, positioned in the center between the cathode [...] "filament" [...] and the anode [...] "plate" [...] electrodes. He reportedly called the zig-zag <b>control</b> <b>wire</b> a [...] "grid" [...] due to its similarity to the [...] "gridiron" [...] lines on American football playing fields. [...] Experiments conducted with his assistant, John V. L. Hogan, convinced {{him that he had}} discovered an important new radio detector, and he quickly prepared a patent application which was filed on January 29, 1907, and received U.S. patent number 879,532 on February 18, 1908. Because the grid-control Audion was the only configuration to become commercially valuable, the earlier versions were forgotten, and the term [...] "Audion" [...] later became synonymous with just the grid type. It later also became known as the triode.|$|E

50|$|The {{final report}} states the {{following}} reason of the accident:The aviation incident with An-12 aircraft registered RA-12957 occurred {{as a result}} of impact with ground caused by lost control over the aircraft due to the destruction of aileron <b>control</b> <b>wires</b> during an emergency approach for landing because of smoke in the cabin.... Aileron <b>control</b> <b>wires</b> were destroyed most probably due to significant heating of nearby steel wires and subsequent breaking under operating load.The heating may have been caused by in-flight fire of nearby power lines, which is evidence by smoke in the cabin, unexpected triggering of multiple warnings, equipment failures and failure of two engines.|$|R
50|$|The servo is {{controlled}} by three wires: ground, power, and control. The servo will move based on the pulses sent over the <b>control</b> <b>wire,</b> which set {{the angle of the}} actuator arm. The servo expects a pulse every 20 ms in order to gain correct information about the angle. The width of the servo pulse dictates the range of the servo's angular motion.|$|E
50|$|Typically {{utilized}} in architectural lighting, a current sinking control scheme uses ballast or driver provided 10v DC. The controller is reducing the returned volts to the light. If the controller returns the full 10v the light will dim to the minimum level. The light {{will be at}} full bright if no volts are returned. The current sinking scheme creates a fail safe situation. Should a <b>control</b> <b>wire</b> be cut or the controller fail, the lights will illuminate.|$|E

50|$|During this {{engagement}} with the weapon, the ARVN tankers appeared fascinated by the missile's slow and erratic flight, but through experience, they soon deployed counter measures against the weapon system. Upon launching by the enemy, ARVN crewmen would fire all their weapons towards the Sagger's firing position, which would make the gunner flinch and lose control of his missile. Although the gunner could take cover away from the launch site, the joystick <b>control</b> <b>wire</b> only allowed 15 meters of clearance. During the engagement, the ARVN eventually lost eight tanks to the 9M14M missile, but had developed tactics to defend themselves against it.|$|E

50|$|There are a {{total of}} five pins used in MHL rather than the 19 used in HDMI, namely: a {{differential}} pair for data, a bi-directional control channel (CBUS), power charging supply, and ground. This permits a much lighter cable and a much smaller connector on the mobile device, as a typical MHL source will be shared with USB 2.0 on a standard 5-pin Micro-USB receptacle. (Although MHL ports can be dedicated to MHL alone, the standard is designed to permit port sharing with the most commonly used ports.) The USB port switches from USB to MHL when it recognizes an MHL-qualified sink (i.e., TV) detected on the <b>control</b> <b>wire.</b> A typical MHL sink will be shared with HDMI on a standard 19-pin HDMI receptacle.|$|E

5000|$|In modern RC servos {{the angle}} of {{mechanical}} rotation {{is determined by the}} width of an electrical pulse that is applied to the <b>control</b> <b>wire.</b> This is a form of pulse-width modulation. The typical RC servo expects to see a pulse every 20 ms, however this can vary within a wide range that differs from servo to servo. The width of the pulse will determine how far the motor turns. For example, in many RC servos a 1.5 ms pulse will make the motor turn to the 90° position (neutral position). The low time (and the total period) can vary over a wide range, and vary from one pulse to the next, without any effect on the position of the servo motor.|$|E
50|$|Equipment {{for this}} {{override}} (NBÜ) {{is necessary in}} tunnels above 1000 m. For regional trains, UIC 541-5 is not sufficient since 2011, long distance trains must at least be equipped with UIC 541-5. The sections where not to stop are marked with yellow bars on the kilometer signs. Regional trains, except MUs, are usually equipped with NBÜ 2004, which results in a display and a break {{a few seconds later}} if the train driver doesn't respond. For DB Regio, the rules for the staff are given in Ril 494. Long distance trains are mostly equipped with system DB, which uses the UIC 558 <b>control</b> <b>wire,</b> which results in conflicts with some door control systems and is therefore not used in regional trains. In MUs, usually a special implementation is used.|$|E

50|$|Some early {{microprocessors}} (e.g. the Zilog Z80) provided special internal registers {{that could}} provide the Row-Address Strobe (RAS) to refresh dynamic memory cells, the register being incremented on each refresh cycle. This could also be accomplished by other integrated circuits already {{being used in the}} system, if these already generated cycling accesses across RAM (e.g. the Motorola 6845). In CPUs such as the Z80, the availability of a RAS refresh was a big selling-point due to its simplifying hardware design. Here, RAS refresh is signalled by a unique combination of address and <b>control</b> <b>wires</b> during operationally redundant clock cycles (T-States), i.e. during instruction decode/execution when the buses may not be required. Instead of the bus being inactive during such T-states, the refresh register would be presented on the address bus along with a combination of <b>control</b> <b>wires</b> to indicate to the refresh circuitry.|$|R

50|$|The Eryx missile uses a SACLOS {{guidance}} system, the launcher tracks a {{light source}} {{on the rear}} of the missile and compares its position with the center of the launcher's cross-hair, sending corrective signals down a trailing <b>control</b> <b>wire.</b> The missile increases resistance to jamming by having a beacon as the light source on {{the rear of the}} missile that pulsates or blinks at a special encoded rate recognized by the Eryx's tracking device located on the launch post. Unlike most wire guides antitank missiles that use SACLOS guidance, which require a complex optical tracker unit that has to zoom from a wide to narrow view in micro seconds after the missile is launched (e.g. the MILAN), the Eryx uses one charge-coupled device (CCD) matrix that operate in the IR spectrum, and two fields of view (one narrow and one large) with an automatic switch during missile flight. Again Aérospatiale also states that this unique and simplified SACLOS tracking system provides for a far more cost effective solution and enable the Eryx to be highly resistant to decoys or jamming and other enemy counter measures.|$|E
