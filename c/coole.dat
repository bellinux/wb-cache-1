25|$|Idyllic and {{pleasant}} as this concept was for those living upstairs, {{it was bad}} news for the servants, as the first and most obvious solution was to bury them. Nowhere is this more evident than at Castle <b>Coole</b> in Northern Ireland. The entire servant's quarters were put underground into cellars, lit only by windows at the bottom of grated pits. The only means of approach was through a single underground tunnel, the entrance of which was concealed by the brow of a landscaped hill some distance from the house.|$|E
25|$|On 25 March at 3:30 am Peter Petrovich Pahlen {{began to}} send out patrols {{at the request of}} Crown Prince Frederick William of Württemberg. The Allied advance was {{conducted}} in two columns. The first column on the main highway west from Vitry-le-François consisted of the Crown Prince (IV Corps) and Nikolay Raevsky (VI Corps), followed by Wrede (V Corps). The second column on more a southerly route through Montépreux was composed of the Guard and Reserves while Ignaz Gyulai (III Corps) was directed to march toward Semoine. From <b>Coole</b> Pahlen's 3,600 cavalry led the advance of the first column until his horsemen appeared before Soudé between 6:00 and 8:00 am. Meanwhile, Mortier's corps was on the march at 6:00 from Vatry toward Soudé with Nicolas-François Roussel d'Hurbal's dragoons leading the column.|$|E
25|$|After {{a lively}} debate between Belliard {{and the two}} marshals over what was the best route to {{approach}} the Marne, on 24 March the French marched through Fère-Champenoise and Vatry. Henri Catherine Balthazard Vincent moved toward Montmirail with 300 men watch for Yorck and Kleist. During the day, Mortier's cavalry scouted {{in the direction of}} Châlons and Saint-Quentin-sur-Coole, finding only a few hundred enemy cavalry in Châlons and no Allied troops near Nuisement-sur-Coole. Marmont scouted toward Maisons-en-Champagne and found no enemies. Based on these reports, the two marshals decided that Schwarzenberg was south of Saint-Dizier, maneuvering against Napoleon. Bolstered in their opinions by the day's reconnaissances, Marmont and Mortier failed to reconsider even when large numbers of campfires were observed that night beyond the <b>Coole.</b> Marmont's troops camped between Vatry and Soudé while Mortier's bivouacked farther north.|$|E
25|$|In {{some large}} houses from the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, enormous and ingenious efforts of building and design were employed to keep the staff out of sight. The service wings were often only accessed by underground tunnels as at Rockingham house and Castle <b>Coole,</b> both, in Ireland. At Mentmore Towers, where the service wing is a large block the same size as the mansion itself, the main part of the house is built on artificially raised ground allowing it to tower over the service wings which are in reality of a near similar height. The only windows to Mentmore's service wings were to an inner courtyard, thus preventing the servant's looking out on their employers, or their employers catching accidental sight of them. The outer, but blind, walls of the wings are of attractive dressed Ancaster stone adorned with niches and statuary, while the inner courtyard visible only to the servants is of common yellow brick. However the majority of the wing is hidden by dense planting.|$|E
25|$|After {{looking at}} the {{captured}} messages, Czar Alexander I of Russia at his headquarters at Sompuis concluded that the Allied armies should advance on Paris. He asked Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, Hans Karl von Diebitsch and Karl Wilhelm von Toll for their advice. Barclay wished to follow Napoleon but Toll wanted to move on Paris while sending 10,000 cavalry to hide the maneuver from Napoleon. After Diebitsch came around to Toll and Alexander's point of view, they convinced first King Frederick William III of Prussia and then Schwarzenberg of their plan. On 24 March, Schwarzenberg's army moved north toward Vitry-le-François, but new orders were issued for the following day. Wintzingerode was instructed to chase after Napoleon with his cavalry force. The VI Corps supported by the IV Corps were ordered to march west toward Fère-Champenoise with their combined cavalry in front. The Guards and Reserves were directed on the same place from Sompuis while the III Corps was to move north from Mailly-le-Camp. Vorontsov, Langeron and Sacken of Blücher's army were instructed to move west from Châlons-sur-Marne toward Étoges. By the evening of 24 March, Schwarzenberg's host was near Vitry, on the east bank of the <b>Coole</b> (Côle) River.|$|E
500|$|The neoclassical presidential mansion, the White House in Washington, was {{inspired}} by Irish Palladianism. Both Castle <b>Coole</b> and Richard Cassel's Leinster House in Dublin claim to have inspired the architect James Hoban, who designed the executive mansion, built between 1792 and 1800. Hoban, born in Callan, County Kilkenny, in 1762, studied architecture in Dublin, where Leinster House (built c. 1747) {{was one of the}} finest buildings at the time. The White House is more neoclassical than Palladian; particularly the South façade, which closely resembles James Wyatt's 1790 design for Castle <b>Coole,</b> also in Ireland. Castle <b>Coole</b> is, {{in the words of the}} architectural commentator Gervase Jackson-Stops, [...] "A culmination of the Palladian traditions, yet strictly neoclassical in its chaste ornament and noble austerity." ...|$|E
500|$|Lady Gregory, whom Shaw once {{described}} as [...] "the greatest living Irishwoman" [...] died at home aged 80 from breast cancer, and {{is buried in}} the New Cemetery in Bohermore, County Galway. The entire contents of <b>Coole</b> Park were auctioned three months after her death, {{and the house was}} demolished in 1941.|$|E
500|$|She married Sir William Henry Gregory, {{a widower}} with an estate at <b>Coole</b> Park, near Gort, on 4 March 1880 in St Matthias' Church, Dublin. Sir William, who was 35 years her elder, had just retired from his {{position}} as Governor of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), having previously served several terms as Member of Parliament for County Galway. He was a well-educated man with many literary and artistic interests, and the house at <b>Coole</b> Park housed a large library and extensive art collection, both of which Lady Gregory was eager to explore. He also had a house in London, where the couple spent {{a considerable amount of}} time, holding weekly salons frequented by many leading literary and artistic figures of the day, including Robert Browning, Lord Tennyson, John Everett Millais and Henry James. Their only child, Robert Gregory, was born in 1881. He was killed during the First World War while serving as a pilot, an event which inspired W. B. Yeats's poems [...] "An Irish Airman Foresees His Death", [...] "In Memory of Major Robert Gregory" [...] and [...] "Shepherd and Goatherd".|$|E
500|$|Lady Gregory {{is mainly}} remembered {{for her work}} behind the Irish Literary Revival. Her home at <b>Coole</b> Park in County Galway served as an {{important}} meeting place for leading Revival figures, and her early work {{as a member of}} the board of the Abbey was at least as important as her creative writings for that theatre's development. Lady Gregory's motto was taken from Aristotle: [...] "To think like a wise man, but to express oneself like the common people." ...|$|E
500|$|A trip to Inisheer in the Aran Islands in 1893 re-awoke for Lady Gregory an {{interest}} in the Irish language and in the folklore of the area in which she lived. She organised Irish lessons at the school at <b>Coole,</b> and began collecting tales from the area around her home, especially from the residents of Gort workhouse. One of the tutors she employed was Norma Borthwick, who would visit <b>Coole</b> numerous times. This activity led to the publication of a number of volumes of folk material, including A Book of Saints and Wonders (1906), The Kiltartan History Book (1909) and The Kiltartan Wonder Book (1910). She also produced a number of collections of [...] "Kiltartanese" [...] versions of Irish myths, including Cuchulain of Muirthemne (1902) and Gods and Fighting Men (1904). ("Kiltartanese" [...] is Lady Gregory's term for English with Gaelic syntax, based on the dialect spoken in Kiltartan.) In his introduction to the former, Yeats wrote [...] "I think this book is the best that has come out of Ireland in my time." [...] James Joyce was to parody this claim in the Scylla and Charybdis chapter of his novel Ulysses.|$|E
500|$|Yeats {{was close}} to Lady Gregory and her home place of <b>Coole</b> Park, Co, Galway. He would often visit and stay there {{as it was a}} central meeting place for people who {{supported}} the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem, [...] "The Wild Swans at Coole" [...] was written there, between 1916 and 1917. He collaborated with Lady Gregory on a book of Irish mythology, writing the preface. [...] "One must not expect in these stories the epic lineaments, the many incidents, woven into one great event of, let us say the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne, or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne." ...|$|E
500|$|Lady Gregory {{remained}} an active {{director of the}} theatre until ill-health led to her retirement in 1928. During this time she wrote more than 19 plays, mainly for production at the Abbey. Many of these were written in an attempted transliteration of the Hiberno-English dialect spoken around <b>Coole</b> Park that became widely known as Kiltartanese, from the nearby village of Kiltartan. Her plays had {{been among the most}} successful at the Abbey in the earlier years, but their popularity declined. Indeed, the Irish writer Oliver St. John Gogarty once wrote [...] "the perpetual presentation of her plays nearly ruined the Abbey". In addition to her plays, she wrote a two-volume study of the folklore of her native area called Visions and Beliefs in the West of Ireland in 1920. She also played the lead role in three performances of Cathleen Ni Houlihan in 1919.|$|E
500|$|When {{she retired}} from the Abbey board, Lady Gregory {{returned}} to live in Galway, although she continued to visit Dublin regularly. The house and demesne at <b>Coole</b> Park had been sold to the Irish Forestry Commission in 1927, with Lady Gregory retaining life tenancy. Her Galway home had long been {{a focal point for}} the writers associated with the Irish Literary Revival, and this continued after her retirement. On a tree in what were the grounds of the house, one can still see the carved initials of Synge, Æ, Yeats and his artist brother Jack, George Moore, Seán O'Casey, George Bernard Shaw, Katharine Tynan and Violet Martin. Yeats wrote five poems about, or set in, the house and grounds: [...] "The Wild Swans at Coole", [...] "I walked among the seven woods of Coole", [...] "In the Seven Woods", [...] "Coole Park, 1929" [...] and [...] "Coole Park and Ballylee, 1931".|$|E
500|$|During {{her time}} {{on the board of}} the Abbey, <b>Coole</b> Park {{remained}} her home; she spent her time in Dublin staying in a number of hotels. For example, at the time of the 1911 national census, she was staying in a hotel at 16 South Frederick Street. In these she dined frugally, often on food she had brought with her from home. She frequently used her hotel rooms to interview would-be Abbey dramatists and to entertain the company after opening nights of new plays. She spent many of her days working on her translations in the National Library of Ireland. She gained a reputation as being a somewhat conservative figure. For example, when Denis Johnston submitted to the Abbey his first play, Shadowdance, it was rejected by Lady Gregory and returned to the author with [...] "The Old Lady says No" [...] written on the title page. Johnston decided to rename the play, and The Old Lady Says 'No!' [...] was eventually staged by the Gate Theatre in 1928.|$|E
500|$|She {{continued}} to write prose {{during the period}} of her marriage. During the winter of 1883, whilst her husband was in Ceylon, she worked on a series of memoirs of her childhood home, with a view to publishing them under the title An Emigrant's Notebook, but this plan was abandoned. She wrote a series of pamphlets in 1887 called Over the River, in which she appealed for funds for the parish of St. Stephens in Southwark, south London. She also wrote a number of short stories in the years 1890 and 1891, although these also never appeared in print. A number of unpublished poems from this period have also survived. When Sir William Gregory died in March 1892, Lady Gregory went into mourning and returned to <b>Coole</b> Park; there she edited her husband's autobiography, which she published in 1894. She was to write later, [...] "If I had not married I should not have learned the quick enrichment of sentences that one gets in conversation; had I not been widowed I should not have found the detachment of mind, the leisure for observation necessary to give insight into character, to express and interpret it. Loneliness made me rich—'full', as Bacon says." ...|$|E

2500|$|Externally it was {{unremarkable}} (illustration, right), but the classicising domed hall {{surrounded by}} galleried aisles and apsidal ends, {{was something new}} in assembly rooms, and brought its architect immediate celebrity. The design was exhibited at the Royal Academy, private commissions followed, and {{at the age of}} 26 Wyatt found himself a fashionable domestic architect and on 27 August 1770 an Associate of the Royal Academy. His polished manners secured him friends as well as patrons among the great, and when it was rumoured {{that he was about to}} leave the country to become architect to Catherine II of Russia, a group of English noblemen is said to have offered him a retaining fee of £1,200 to remain in their service. His major neoclassical country houses include Heaton Hall near Manchester (1772), Heveningham Hall in Suffolk (circa 1788-99), [...] and Castle <b>Coole</b> in Ireland, as well as Packington Hall in Staffordshire, the home of the Levett family for generations, and Dodington Park in Gloucestershire for the Codrington family. On 15 February 1785 Wyatt was elected an Academician of the Royal Academy, his diploma work being a drawing of the Darnley Mausoleum.|$|E

6000|$|This book is, in part, a reprint of The Wild Swans at <b>Coole,</b> {{printed a}} year ago on my sister's hand-press at Dundrum, Co. Dublin. I have not, however, reprinted a play which may {{be a part of}} a book of new plays {{suggested}} by the dance plays of Japan, and I have added a number of new poems. Michael Robartes and John Aherne, whose names occur in one or other of these, are characters in some stories I wrote years ago, who have once again become a part of the phantasmagoria through which I can alone express my convictions about the world. I have the fancy that I read the name John Aherne among those of men prosecuted for making a disturbance at the first production of [...] "The Play Boy," [...] which may account for his animosity to myself.|$|E
6000|$|Certain {{woods at}} Sligo, the woods above Dooney Rock and those above the {{waterfall}} at Ben Bulben, though I shall never perhaps walk there again, are so {{deep in my}} affections that I dream about them at night; and yet the woods at <b>Coole,</b> though they do not come into my dream {{are so much more}} knitted to my thought, that when I am dead they will have, I am persuaded, my longest visit. When we are dead, according to my belief, we live our lives backward for a certain number of years, treading the paths that we have trodden, growing young again, even childish again, till some attain an innocence that is no longer a mere accident of nature, but the human intellect's crowning achievement. It was at <b>Coole</b> that the first few simple thoughts that now, grown complex, through their contact with other thoughts, explain the world, came to me from beyond my own mind. I practised meditations, and these, as I think, so affected my sleep that I began to have dreams that differed from ordinary dreams in seeming to take place amid brilliant light, and by their invariable coherence, and certain half-dreams, if I can call them so, between sleep and waking. I have noticed that such experiences come to me most often amid distraction, at some time that seems of all times the least fitting, as though it were necessary for the exterior mind to be engaged elsewhere, and it was during 1897 and 1898, when I was always just arriving from or just setting out to some political meeting, that the first dreams came. I was crossing a little stream near Inchy Wood and actually {{in the middle of a}} stride from bank to bank, when an emotion never experienced before swept down upon me. I said, [...] "That is what the devout Christian feels, that is how he surrenders his will to the will of God." [...] I felt an extreme surprise for my whole imagination was preoccupied with the pagan mythology of ancient Ireland, I was marking in red ink upon a large map, every sacred mountain. The next morning I awoke near dawn, to hear a voice saying, [...] "The love of God is infinite for every human soul because every human soul is unique, no other can satisfy the same need in God." ...|$|E

6000|$|On the sea coast at Duras, a {{few miles}} from <b>Coole,</b> an old French Count, Florimond de Bastero, lived for certain months in every year. Lady Gregory and I talked over my project of an Irish Theatre looking out upon the lawn of his house, {{watching}} a large flock of ducks that was always gathered for his arrival from Paris, {{and that would be a}} very small flock, if indeed it were a flock at all, when he set out for Rome in the autumn. I told her that I had given up my project because it was impossible to get the few pounds necessary for a start in little halls, and she promised to collect or give the money necessary. That was her first great service to the Irish intellectual movement. She reminded me the other day that when she first asked me what she could do to help our movement I suggested nothing; and, certainly, no more foresaw her genius that I foresaw that of John Synge, nor had she herself foreseen it. Our theatre had been established before she wrote or had any ambition to write, and yet her little comedies have merriment and beauty, an unusual combination, and those two volumes where the Irish heroic tales are arranged and translated in an English so simple and so noble, may do more than other books to deepen Irish imagination. They contain our ancient literature, are something better than our Mabinogion, are almost our Morte D'Arthur. It is more fitting, however, that in a book of memoirs I should speak of her personal influence, and especially as no witness is likely to arise better qualified to speak. If that influence were lacking, Ireland would be greatly impoverished, so much has been planned out in the library, or among the woods at Coole; for it was there that John Shawe Taylor found the independence from class and family that made him summon the conference between landlord and tenant, that brought land purchase, and it was there that Hugh Lane formed those Irish ambitions that led to his scattering many thousands, and gathering much ingratitude; and where, but for that conversation at Florimond de Bastero's, had been the genius of Synge? ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{poet who}} {{helped her to}} so much fame has himself a great fame {{throughout}} the west of Ireland. Some think that Raftery was half blind, and say, [...] "I saw Raftery, a dark man, but he had sight enough to see her," [...] or the like, but some think he was wholly blind, as {{he may have been}} {{at the end of his}} life. Fable makes all things perfect in their kind, and her blind people must never look on the world and the sun. I asked a man I met one day, when I was looking for a pool na mna Sidhe where women of faery have been seen, bow Raftery could have admired Mary Hynes so much f he had been altogether blind? He said, [...] "I think Raftery was altogether blind, but those that are blind have a way of seeing things, and have the power to know more, and to feel more, and to do more, and to guess more than those that have their sight, and a certain wit and a certain wisdom is given to them." [...] Everybody, indeed, will tell you that he was very wise, for was he not only blind but a poet? The weaver whose words about Mary Hynes I have already given, says, [...] "His poetry was the gift of the Almighty, for there are three things that are the gift of the Almighty--poetry and dancing and principles. That is why in the old times an ignorant man coming down from the hillside would be better behaved and have better learning than a man with education you'd meet now, for they got it from God"; and a man at <b>Coole</b> says, [...] "When he put his finger to one part of his head, everything would come to him as if it was written in a book"; and an old pensioner at Kiltartan says, [...] "He was standing under a bush one time, and he talked to it, and it answered him back in Irish. Some say it was the bush that spoke, but it must have been an enchanted voice in it, and it gave him the knowledge of all the things of the world. The bush withered up afterwards, and it is to be seen on the roadside now between this and Rahasine." [...] There is a poem of his about a bush, which I have never seen, and it may have come out of the cauldron of fable in this shape.|$|E

[...] 450 [...] Thus when with meats & drinks they had suffic'd, [...] Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind arose [...] In Adam, not to let th' occasion pass [...] Given him by this great Conference to know [...] Of things above his World, and of thir being [...] Who dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he saw [...] Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms [...] Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far [...] Exceeded human, and his wary speech [...] Thus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd. [...] 460 [...] Inhabitant with God, now know I well [...] Thy favour, in this honour done to man, [...] Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf't [...] To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, [...] Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, [...] As that more willingly thou couldst not seem [...] At Heav'ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare? [...] To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd. [...] O Adam, one Almightie is, from whom [...] All things proceed, and up to him return, [...] 470 [...] If not deprav'd from good, created all [...] Such to perfection, one first matter all, [...] Indu'd with various forms, various degrees [...] Of substance, and in things that live, of life; [...] But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure, [...] As neerer to him plac't or neerer tending [...] Each in thir several active Sphears assignd, [...] Till body up to spirit work, in bounds [...] Proportiond to each kind. So from the root [...] Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves [...] 480 [...] More aerie, last the bright consummate floure [...] Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit [...] Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd [...] To vital Spirits aspire, to animal, [...] To intellectual, give both life and sense, [...] Fansie and understanding, whence the soule [...] Reason receives, and reason is her being, [...] Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse [...] Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, [...] Differing but in degree, of kind the same. [...] 490 [...] Wonder not then, what God for you saw good [...] If I refuse not, but convert, as you, [...] To proper substance; time may come when men [...] With Angels may participate, and find [...] No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare: [...] And from these corporal nutriments perhaps [...] Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit [...] Improv'd by tract of time, and wingd ascend [...] Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice [...] Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell; [...] 500 [...] If ye be found obedient, and retain [...] Unalterably firm his love entire [...] Whose progenie you are. Mean while enjoy [...] Your fill what happiness this happie state [...] Can comprehend, incapable of more. [...] To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli'd. [...] O favourable spirit, propitious guest, [...] Well hast thou taught the way that might direct [...] Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set [...] From center to circumference, whereon [...] 510 [...] In contemplation of created things [...] By steps we may ascend to God. But say, [...] What meant that caution joind, If Ye Be Found [...] Obedient? can wee want obedience then [...] To him, or possibly his love desert [...] Who formd us from the dust, and plac'd us here [...] Full to the utmost measure of what bliss [...] Human desires can seek or apprehend? [...] To whom the Angel. Son of Heav'n and Earth, [...] Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God; [...] 520 [...] That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self, [...] That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. [...] This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd. [...] God made thee perfet, not immutable; [...] And good he made thee, but to persevere [...] He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will [...] By nature free, not over-rul'd by Fate [...] Inextricable, or strict necessity; [...] Our voluntarie service he requires, [...] Not our necessitated, such with him [...] 530 [...] Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how [...] Can hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serve [...] Willing or no, who will but what they must [...] By Destinie, and can no other choose? [...] My self and all th' Angelic Host that stand [...] In sight of God enthron'd, our happie state [...] Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; [...] On other surety none; freely we serve. [...] Because wee freely love, as in our will [...] To love or not; in this we stand or fall: [...] 540 [...] And som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n, [...] And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fall [...] From what high state of bliss into what woe! [...] To whom our great Progenitor. Thy words [...] Attentive, and with more delighted eare [...] Divine instructer, I have heard, then when [...] Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills [...] Aereal Music send: nor knew I not [...] To be both will and deed created free; [...] Yet that we never shall forget to love [...] 550 [...] Our maker, and obey him whose command [...] Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts [...] Assur'd me and still assure: though what thou tellst [...] Hath past in Heav'n, som doubt within me move, [...] But more desire to hear, if thou consent, [...] The full relation, which must needs be strange, [...] Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard; [...] And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun [...] Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins [...] His other half in the great Zone of Heav'n. [...] 560 [...] Thus Adam made request, and Raphael [...] After short pause assenting, thus began. [...] High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men, [...] Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate [...] To human sense th' invisible exploits [...] Of warring Spirits; how without remorse [...] The ruin of so many glorious once [...] And perfet while they stood; how last unfould [...] The secrets of another world, perhaps [...] Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good [...] 570 [...] This is dispenc't, and what surmounts the reach [...] Of human sense, I shall delineate so, [...] By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, [...] As may express them best, though what if Earth [...] Be but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things therein [...] Each to other like, more then on earth is thought? [...] As yet this world was not, and Chaos wilde [...] Reignd where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now rests [...] Upon her Center pois'd, when on a day [...] (For Time, though in Eternitie, appli'd [...] 580 [...] To motion, measures all things durable [...] By present, past, and future) on such day [...] As Heav'ns great Year brings forth, th' Empyreal Host [...] Of Angels by Imperial summons call'd, [...] Innumerable before th' Almighties Throne [...] Forthwith from all the ends of Heav'n appeerd [...] Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright [...] Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc'd, [...] Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare [...] Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve [...] 590 [...] Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees; [...] Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz'd [...] Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love [...] Recorded eminent. Thus when in Orbes [...] Of circuit inexpressible they stood, [...] Orb within Orb, the Father infinite, [...] By whom in bliss imbosom'd sat the Son, [...] Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whose top [...] Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. [...] Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light, [...] 600 [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand. [...] This day I have begot whom I declare [...] My onely Son, and on this holy Hill [...] Him have anointed, whom ye now behold [...] At my right hand; your Head I him appoint; [...] And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow [...] All knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord: [...] Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide [...] United as one individual Soule [...] 610 [...] For ever happie: him who disobeyes [...] Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day [...] Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls [...] Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place [...] Ordaind without redemption, without end. [...] So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his words [...] All seemd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all. [...] That day, as other solem dayes, they spent [...] In song and dance about the sacred Hill, [...] Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare [...] 620 [...] Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles [...] Resembles nearest, mazes intricate, [...] Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular [...] Then most, when most irregular they seem: [...] And in thir motions harmonie Divine [...] So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear [...] Listens delighted. Eevning approachd [...] (For we have also our Eevning and our Morn, [...] We ours for change delectable, not need) [...] Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn [...] 630 [...] Desirous, all in Circles as they stood, [...] Tables are set, and on a sudden pil'd [...] With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows: [...] In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold, [...] Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav'n. [...] They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet [...] Are fill'd, before th' all bounteous King, who showrd [...] With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy. [...] Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal'd [...] From that high mount of God, whence light & shade [...] 640 [...] Spring both, the face of brightest Heav'n had changd [...] To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there [...] In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos'd [...] All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest, [...] Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr [...] Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred, [...] (Such are the Courts of God) Th' Angelic throng [...] Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend [...] By living Streams among the Trees of Life, [...] Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard, [...] 650 [...] Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept [...] Fannd with <b>coole</b> Winds, save those who in thir course [...] Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne [...] Alternate all night long: but not so wak'd [...] Satan, so call him now, his former name [...] Is heard no more Heav'n; he of the first, [...] If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power, [...] In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught [...] With envie against the Son of God, that day [...] Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd [...] 660 [...] Messiah King anointed, could not beare [...] Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird. [...] Deep malice thence conceiving & disdain, [...] Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre [...] Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd [...] With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave [...] Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supream [...] Contemptuous, and his next subordinate [...] Awak'ning, thus to him in secret spake. [...] Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close [...] 670 [...] Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree [...] Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips [...] Of Heav'ns Almightie. Thou to me thy thoughts [...] Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart; [...] Both waking we were one; how then can now [...] Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos'd; [...] New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise [...] In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate [...] What doubtful may ensue, more in this place [...] To utter is not safe. Assemble thou [...] 680 [...] Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief; [...] Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night [...] Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste, [...] And all who under me thir Banners wave, [...] Homeward with flying march where we possess [...] The Quarters of the North, there to prepare [...] Fit entertainment to receive our King [...] The great Messiah, and his new commands, [...] Who speedily through all the Hierarchies [...] Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws. [...] 690 [...] So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd [...] Bad influence into th' unwarie brest [...] Of his Associate; hee together calls, [...] Or several one by one, the Regent Powers, [...] Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught, [...] That the most High commanding, now ere Night, [...] Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav'n, [...] The great Hierarchal Standard was to move; [...] Tells the suggested cause, and casts between [...] Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound [...] 700 [...] Or taint integritie; but all obey'd [...] The wonted signal, and superior voice [...] Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed [...] His name, and high was his degree in Heav'n; [...] His count'nance, as the Morning Starr that guides [...] The starrie flock, allur'd them, and with lyes [...] Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Host: [...] Mean while th' Eternal eye, whose sight discernes [...] Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount [...] And from within the golden Lamps that burne [...] 710 [...] Nightly before him, saw without thir light [...] Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred [...] Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes [...] Were banded to oppose his high Decree; [...] And smiling to his onely Son thus said. [...] Son, thou in whom my glory I behold [...] In full resplendence, Heir of all my might, [...] Neerly it now concernes us to be sure [...] Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms [...] We mean to hold what anciently we claim [...] 720 [...] Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe [...] Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne [...] Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North; [...] Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie [...] In battel, what our Power is, or our right. [...] Let us advise, and to this hazard draw [...] With speed what force is left, and all imploy [...] In our defence, lest unawares we lose [...] This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill. [...] To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer [...] 730 [...] Light'ning Divine, ineffable, serene, [...] Made answer. Mightie Father, thou thy foes [...] Justly hast in derision, and secure [...] Laugh'st at thir vain designes and tumults vain, [...] Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate [...] Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power [...] Giv'n me to quell thir pride, and in event [...] Know whether I be dextrous to subdue [...] Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav'n. [...] So spake the Son, but Satan with his Powers [...] 740 [...] Farr was advanc't on winged speed, an Host [...] Innumerable as the Starrs of Night, [...] Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun [...] Impearls on every leaf and every flouer. [...] Regions they pass'd, the mightie Regencies [...] Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones [...] In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which [...] All thy Dominion, Adam, is no more [...] Then what this Garden is to all the Earth, [...] And all the Sea, from one entire globose [...] 750 [...] Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass'd [...] At length into the limits of the North [...] They came, and Satan to his Royal seat [...] High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount [...] Rais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs [...] From Diamond Quarries hew'n, & Rocks of Gold, [...] The Palace of great Lucifer, (so call [...] That Structure in the Dialect of men [...] Interpreted) which not long after, hee [...] Affecting all equality with God, [...] 760 [...] In imitation of that Mount whereon [...] Messiah was declar'd in sight of Heav'n, [...] The Mountain of the Congregation call'd; [...] For thither he assembl'd all his Train, [...] Pretending so commanded to consult [...] About the great reception of thir King, [...] Thither to come, and with calumnious Art [...] Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears. [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers, [...] If these magnific Titles yet remain [...] 770 [...] Not meerly titular, since by Decree [...] Another now hath to himself ingross't [...] All Power, and us eclipst under the name [...] Of King anointed, for whom all this haste [...] Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here, [...] This onely to consult how we may best [...] With what may be devis'd of honours new [...] Receive him coming to receive from us [...] Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile, [...] Too much to one, but double how endur'd, [...] 780 [...] To one and to his image now proclaim'd? [...] But what if better counsels might erect [...] Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke? [...] Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend [...] The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust [...] To know ye right, or if ye know your selves [...] Natives and Sons of Heav'n possest before [...] By none, and if not equal all, yet free, [...] Equally free; for Orders and Degrees [...] Jarr not with liberty, but well consist. [...] 790 [...] Who can in reason then or right assume [...] Monarchie over such as live by right [...] His equals, if in power and splendor less, [...] In freedome equal? or can introduce [...] Law and Edict on us, who without law [...] Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord, [...] And look for adoration to th' abuse [...] Of those Imperial Titles which assert [...] Our being ordain'd to govern, not to serve? [...] Thus farr his bold discourse without controule [...] 800 [...] Had audience, when among the Seraphim [...] Abdiel, then whom none with more zeale ador'd [...] The Deitie, and divine commands obei'd, [...] Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe [...] The current of his fury thus oppos'd. [...] O argument blasphemous, false and proud! [...] Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav'n [...] Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate [...] In place thy self so high above thy Peeres. [...] Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne [...] 810 [...] The just Decree of God, pronounc't and sworn, [...] That to his only Son by right endu'd [...] With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav'n [...] Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due [...] Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist [...] Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free, [...] And equal over equals to let Reigne, [...] One over all with unsucceeded power. [...] Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute [...] With him the points of libertie, who made [...] 820 [...] Thee what thou art, & formd the Pow'rs of Heav'n [...] Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib'd thir being? [...] Yet by experience taught we know how good, [...] And of our good, and of our dignitie [...] How provident he is, how farr from thought [...] To make us less, bent rather to exalt [...] Our happie state under one Head more neer [...] United. But to grant it thee unjust, [...] That equal over equals Monarch Reigne: [...] Thy self though great & glorious dost thou count, [...] 830 [...] Or all Angelic Nature joind in one, [...] Equal to him begotten Son, by whom [...] As by his Word the mighty Father made [...] All things, ev'n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav'n [...] By him created in thir bright degrees, [...] Crownd them with Glory, & to thir Glory nam'd [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers [...] Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur'd, [...] But more illustrious made, since he the Head [...] One of our number thus reduc't becomes, [...] 840 [...] His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done [...] Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage, [...] And tempt not these; but hast'n to appease [...] Th' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son, [...] While Pardon may be found in time besought. [...] So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale [...] None seconded, as out of season judg'd, [...] Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'd [...] Th' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd. [...] That we were formd then saist thou? & the work [...] 850 [...] Of secondarie hands, by task transferd [...] From Father to his Son? strange point and new! [...] Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw [...] When this creation was? rememberst thou [...] Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being? [...] We know no time when we were not as now; [...] Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais'd [...] By our own quick'ning power, when fatal course [...] Had circl'd his full Orbe, the birth mature [...] Of this our native Heav'n, Ethereal Sons. [...] 860 [...] Our puissance is our own, our own right hand [...] Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try [...] Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold [...] Whether by supplication we intend [...] Address, and to begirt th' Almighty Throne [...] Beseeching or besieging. This report, [...] These tidings carrie to th' anointed King; [...] And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. [...] He said, and as the sound of waters deep [...] Hoarce murmur echo'd to his words applause [...] 870 [...] Through the infinite Host, nor less for that [...] The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone [...] Encompass'd round with foes, thus answerd bold. [...] O alienate from God, O spirit accurst, [...] Forsak'n of all good; I see thy fall [...] Determind, and thy hapless crew involv'd [...] In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred [...] Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth [...] No more be troubl'd how to quit the yoke [...] Of Gods Messiah; those indulgent Laws [...] 880 [...] Will not be now voutsaf't, other Decrees [...] Against thee are gon forth without recall; [...] That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject [...] Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake [...] Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise, [...] Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly [...] These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth [...] Impendent, raging into sudden flame [...] Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel [...] His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire. [...] 890 [...] Then who created thee lamenting learne, [...] When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know. [...] So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found, [...] Among the faithless, faithful only hee; [...] Among innumerable false, unmov'd, [...] Unshak'n, unseduc'd, unterrifi'd [...] His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale; [...] Nor number, nor example with him wrought [...] To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind [...] Though single. From amidst them forth he passd, [...] 900 [...] Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind [...] Superior, nor of violence fear'd aught; [...] And with retorted scorn his back he turn'd [...] On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom'd.|$|E
6000|$|O For that warning voice, {{which he}} who saw [...] Th' Apocalyps, heard cry in Heaven aloud, [...] Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, [...] Came furious down to be reveng'd on men, [...] Wo To The Inhabitants On Earth! that now, [...] While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd [...] The coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd [...] Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now [...] Satan, now first inflam'd with rage, came down, [...] The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind, [...] 10 [...] To wreck on {{innocent}} frail man his loss [...] Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell: [...] Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold, [...] Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, [...] Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth [...] Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, [...] And like a devillish Engine back recoiles [...] Upon himself; horror and doubt distract [...] His troubl'd thoughts, {{and from the}} bottom stirr [...] The Hell within him, for within him Hell [...] 20 [...] He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell [...] One step no more then from himself can fly [...] By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair [...] That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie [...] Of what he was, what is, and what must be [...] Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.

[...] O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd, [...] Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God [...] Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs [...] Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call, [...] But with no friendly voice, and add thy name [...] O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams [...] That bring to my remembrance from what state [...] I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare; [...] Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down [...] 40 [...] Warring in Heav'n against Heav'ns matchless King: [...] Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return [...] From me, whom he created what I was [...] In that bright eminence, and with his good [...] Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. [...] What could be less then to afford him praise, [...] The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, [...] How due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me, [...] And wrought but malice; lifted up so high [...] I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher [...] 50 [...] Would set me highest, {{and in a moment}} quit [...] The debt immense of endless gratitude, [...] So burthensome, still paying, still to ow; [...] Forgetful what from him I still receivd, [...] And understood not that a grateful mind [...] By owing owes not, but still pays, at once [...] Indebted and dischargd; what burden then?

[...] 70 [...] Nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will [...] Chose freely what it now so justly rues. [...] Me miserable! which way shall I flie [...] Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? [...] Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell; [...] And in the lowest deep a lower deep [...] Still threatning to devour me opens wide, [...] To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n.

[...] 80 [...] None left but by submission; and that word [...] Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame [...] Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd [...] With other promises and other vaunts [...] Then to submit, boasting I could subdue [...] Th' Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know [...] How dearly I abide that boast so vaine, [...] Under what torments inwardly I groane; [...] While they adore me on the Throne of Hell, [...] With Diadem and Scepter high advanc'd [...] 90 [...] The lower still I fall, onely Supream [...] In miserie; such joy Ambition findes. [...] But say I could repent and could obtaine [...] By Act of Grace my former state; how soon [...] Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay [...] What feign'd submission swore: ease would recant [...] Vows made in pain, as violent and void. [...] For never can true reconcilement grow [...] Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep: [...] Which would but lead me to a worse relapse [...] 100 [...] And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare [...] Short intermission bought with double smart. [...] This knows my punisher; therefore as farr [...] From granting hee, as I from begging peace: [...] All hope excluded thus, behold in stead [...] Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight, [...] Mankind created, and for him this World. [...] So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear, [...] Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost; [...] Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least [...] 110 [...] Divided Empire with Heav'ns King I hold [...] By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; [...] As Man ere long, and this new World shall know. [...] Thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face [...] Thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair, [...] Which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid [...] Him counterfet, if any eye beheld. [...] For heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule [...] Are ever cleer. Whereof hee soon aware, [...] Each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme, [...] 120 [...] Artificer of fraud; and was the first [...] That practisd falshood under saintly shew, [...] Deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge: [...] Yet not anough had practisd to deceive [...] Uriel once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down [...] The way he went, and on th' Assyrian mount [...] Saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall [...] Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce [...] He markd and mad demeanour, then alone, [...] As he suppos'd, all unobserv'd, unseen. [...] 130 [...] So on he fares, and to the border comes [...] Of Eden, where delicious Paradise, [...] Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green, [...] As with a rural mound the champain head [...] Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides [...] With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, [...] Access deni'd; and over head up grew [...] Insuperable highth of loftiest shade, [...] Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm, [...] A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend [...] 140 [...] Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre [...] Of stateliest view. Yet higher then thir tops [...] The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung: [...] Which to our general Sire gave prospect large [...] Into his neather Empire neighbouring round. [...] And higher then that Wall a circling row [...] Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit, [...] Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue [...] Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: [...] On which the Sun more glad impress'd his beams [...] 150 [...] Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow, [...] When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd [...] That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire [...] Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires [...] Vernal delight and joy, able to drive [...] All sadness but despair: now gentle gales [...] Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense [...] Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole [...] Those balmie spoiles. As when to them who saile [...] Beyond the Cape Of Hope, and now are past [...] 160 [...] Mozambic, off at Sea North-East windes blow [...] Sabean Odours from the spicie shoare [...] Of Arabie the blest, with such delay [...] Well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a League [...] Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles. [...] So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend [...] Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd [...] Then Asmodeus with the fishie fume, [...] That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse [...] Of Tobits Son, and with a vengeance sent [...] 170 [...] From Media post to Aegypt, there fast bound. [...] Now to th' ascent of that steep savage Hill [...] Satan had journied on, pensive and slow; [...] But further way found none, so thick entwin'd, [...] As one continu'd brake, the undergrowth [...] Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext [...] All path of Man or Beast that past that way: [...] One Gate there onely was, and that look'd East [...] On th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw [...] Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, [...] 180 [...] At one slight bound high overleap'd all bound [...] Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within [...] Lights on his feet. As when a prowling Wolfe, [...] Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, [...] Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve [...] In hurdl'd Cotes amid the field secure, [...] Leaps o're the fence with ease into the Fould: [...] Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash [...] Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores, [...] Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, [...] 190 [...] In at the window climbes, or o're the tiles; [...] So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould: [...] So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe. [...] Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life, [...] The middle Tree and highest there that grew, [...] Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life [...] Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death [...] To them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought [...] Of that life-giving Plant, but only us'd [...] For prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge [...] 200 [...] Of immortalitie. So little knows [...] Any, but God alone, to value right [...] The good before him, but perverts best things [...] To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. [...] Beneath him with new wonder now he views [...] To all delight of human sense expos'd [...] In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more, [...] A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise [...] Of God the Garden was, by him in the East [...] Of Eden planted; Eden stretchd her Line [...] 210 [...] From Auran Eastward to the Royal Towrs [...] Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian Kings, [...] Or where the Sons of Eden long before [...] Dwelt in Telassar: in this pleasant soile [...] His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind; [...] Out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow [...] All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; [...] And all amid them stood the Tree of Life, [...] High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit [...] Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life [...] 220 [...] Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by, [...] Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill. [...] Southward through Eden went a River large, [...] Nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill [...] Pass'd underneath ingulft, for God had thrown [...] That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais'd [...] Upon the rapid current, which through veins [...] Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn, [...] Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill [...] Waterd the Garden; thence united fell [...] 230 [...] Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood, [...] Which from his darksom passage now appeers, [...] And now divided into four main Streams, [...] Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme [...] And Country whereof here needs no account, [...] But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, [...] How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks, [...] Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold, [...] With mazie error under pendant shades [...] Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed [...] 240 [...] Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art [...] In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon [...] Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine, [...] Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote [...] The open field, and where the unpierc't shade [...] Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place, [...] A happy rural seat of various view; [...] Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme, [...] Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde [...] Hung amiable, Hesperian Fables true, [...] 250 [...] If true, here onely, and of delicious taste: [...] Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks [...] Grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd, [...] Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap [...] Of som irriguous Valley spread her store, [...] Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose: [...] Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves [...] Of <b>coole</b> recess, o're which the mantling Vine [...] Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps [...] Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall [...] 260 [...] Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake, [...] That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd, [...] Her chrystall mirror holds, unite thir streams. [...] The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, [...] Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune [...] The trembling leaves, while Universal Pan [...] Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance [...] Led on th' Eternal Spring. Not that faire field [...] Of Enna, where Proserpin gathring flours [...] Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie Dis [...] 270 [...] Was gatherd, which cost Ceres all that pain [...] To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove [...] Of Daphne by Orontes, and th' inspir'd [...] Castalian Spring might with this Paradise [...] Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian Ile [...] Girt with the River Triton, where old Cham, [...] Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove, [...] Hid Amalthea and her Florid Son [...] Young Bacchus from his Stepdame Rhea's eye; [...] Nor where Abassin Kings thir issue Guard, [...] 280 [...] Mount Amara, though this by som suppos'd [...] True Paradise under the Ethiop Line [...] By Nilus head, enclos'd with shining Rock, [...] A whole dayes journey high, but wide remote [...] From this Assyrian Garden, where the Fiend [...] Saw undelighted all delight, all kind [...] Of living Creatures new to sight and strange: [...] Two of far nobler shape erect and tall, [...] Godlike erect, with native Honour clad [...] In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all, [...] 290 [...] And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine [...] The image of thir glorious Maker shon, [...] Truth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure, [...] Severe, but in true filial freedom plac't; [...] Whence true autoritie in men; though both [...] Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; [...] For contemplation hee and valour formd, [...] For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace, [...] Hee for God only, shee for God in him: [...] His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar'd [...] 300 [...] Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks [...] Round from his parted forelock manly hung [...] Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: [...] Shee as a vail down to the slender waste [...] Her unadorned golden tresses wore [...] Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd [...] As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd [...] Subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway, [...] And by her yeilded, by him best receivd, [...] Yeilded with coy submission, modest pride, [...] 310 [...] And sweet reluctant amorous delay. [...] Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald, [...] Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame [...] Of natures works, honor dishonorable, [...] Sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind [...] With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, [...] And banisht from mans life his happiest life, [...] Simplicitie and spotless innocence. [...] So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight [...] Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill: [...] 320 [...] So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair [...] That ever since in loves imbraces met, [...] Adam the goodliest man of men since borne [...] His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters Eve. [...] Under a tuft of shade that on a green [...] Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side [...] They sat them down, and after no more toil [...] Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic'd [...] To recommend <b>coole</b> Zephyr, and made ease [...] More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite [...] 330 [...] More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell, [...] Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes [...] Yeilded them, side-long as they sat recline [...] On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours: [...] The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde [...] Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; [...] Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles [...] Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems [...] Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League, [...] Alone as they. About them frisking playd [...] 340 [...] All Beasts of th' Earth, since wilde, and of all chase [...] In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den; [...] Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw [...] Dandl'd the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards [...] Gambold before them, th' unwieldy Elephant [...] To make them mirth us'd all his might, and wreathd [...] His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly [...] Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine [...] His breaded train, and of his fatal guile [...] Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass [...] 350 [...] Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat, [...] Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun [...] Declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer [...] To th' Ocean Iles, and in th' ascending Scale [...] Of Heav'n the Starrs that usher Evening rose: [...] When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood, [...] Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad. [...] O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold, [...] Into our room of bliss thus high advanc't [...] Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, [...] 360 [...] Not Spirits, yet to heav'nly Spirits bright [...] Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue [...] With wonder, and could love, so lively shines [...] In them Divine resemblance, and such grace [...] The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd. [...] Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh [...] Your change approaches, when all these delights [...] Will vanish and deliver ye to woe, [...] More woe, the more your taste is now of joy; [...] Happie, but for so happie ill secur'd [...] 370 [...] Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav'n [...] Ill fenc't for Heav'n to keep out such a foe [...] As now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe [...] To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne [...] Though I unpittied: League with you I seek, [...] And mutual amitie so streight, so close, [...] That I with you must dwell, or you with me [...] Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please [...] Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such [...] Accept your Makers work; he gave it me, [...] 380 [...] Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfould, [...] To entertain you two, her widest Gates, [...] And send forth all her Kings; there will be room, [...] Not like these narrow limits, to receive [...] Your numerous ofspring; if no better place, [...] Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge [...] On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd. [...] And should I at your harmless innocence [...] Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just, [...] Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg'd, [...] 390 [...] By conquering this new World, compels me now [...] To do what else though damnd I should abhorre. [...] So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie, [...] The Tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds. [...] Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree [...] Down he alights among the sportful Herd [...] Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one, [...] Now other, as thir shape servd best his end [...] Neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd [...] To mark what of thir state he more might learn [...] 400 [...] By word or action markt: about them round [...] A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare, [...] Then as a Tiger, who by chance hath spi'd [...] In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play, [...] Strait couches close, then rising changes oft [...] His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground [...] Whence rushing he might surest seise them both [...] Grip't in each paw: when Adam first of men [...] To first of women Eve thus moving speech, [...] Turnd him all eare to heare new utterance flow. [...] 410 [...] Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes, [...] Dearer thy self then all; needs must the Power [...] That made us, and for us this ample World [...] Be infinitly good, and of his good [...] As liberal and free as infinite, [...] That rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here [...] In all this happiness, who at his hand [...] Have nothing merited, nor can performe [...] Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires [...] From us no other service then to keep [...] 420 [...] This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees [...] In Paradise that beare delicious fruit [...] So various, not to taste that onely Tree [...] Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life, [...] So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is, [...] Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst [...] God hath pronounc't it death to taste that Tree, [...] The only sign of our obedience left [...] Among so many signes of power and rule [...] Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv'n [...] 430 [...] Over all other Creatures that possesse [...] Earth, Aire, and Sea. Then let us not think hard [...] One easie prohibition, who enjoy [...] Free leave so large to all things else, and choice [...] Unlimited of manifold delights: [...] But let us ever praise him, and extoll [...] His bountie, following our delightful task [...] To prune these growing Plants, & tend these Flours, [...] Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. [...] To whom thus Eve repli'd. O thou for whom [...] 440 [...] And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh, [...] And without whom am to no end, my Guide [...] And Head, what thou hast said is just and right. [...] For wee to him indeed all praises owe, [...] And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy [...] So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee [...] Preeminent by so much odds, while thou [...] Like consort to thy self canst no where find. [...] That day I oft remember, when from sleep [...] I first awak't, and found my self repos'd [...] 450 [...] Under a shade on flours, much wondring where [...] And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. [...] Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound [...] Of waters issu'd from a Cave and spread [...] Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov'd [...] Pure as th' expanse of Heav'n; I thither went [...] With unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe [...] On the green bank, to look into the cleer [...] Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie. [...] As I bent down to look, just opposite, [...] 460 [...] A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd [...] Bending to look on me, I started back, [...] It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd, [...] Pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks [...] Of sympathie and love, there I had fixt [...] Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire, [...] Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest, [...] What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self, [...] With thee it came and goes: but follow me, [...] And I will bring thee where no shadow staies [...] 470 [...] Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee [...] Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy [...] Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare [...] Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd [...] Mother of human Race: what could I doe, [...] But follow strait, invisibly thus led? [...] Till I espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall, [...] Under a Platan, yet methought less faire, [...] Less winning soft, less amiablie milde, [...] Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd, [...] 480 [...] Thou following cryd'st aloud, Return fair Eve, [...] Whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art, [...] His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent [...] Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart [...] Substantial Life, to have thee by my side [...] Henceforth an individual solace dear; [...] Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim [...] My other half: with that thy gentle hand [...] Seisd mine, I yeilded, and from that time see [...] How beauty is excelld by manly grace [...] 490 [...] And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. [...] So spake our general Mother, and with eyes [...] Of conjugal attraction unreprov'd, [...] And meek surrender, half imbracing leand [...] On our first Father, half her swelling Breast [...] Naked met his under the flowing Gold [...] Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight [...] Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms [...] Smil'd with superior Love, as Jupiter [...] On Juno smiles, when he impregns the Clouds [...] 500 [...] That shed May Flowers; and press'd her Matron lip [...] With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd [...] For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne [...] Ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind. [...] Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two [...] Imparadis't in one anothers arms [...] The happier Eden, shall enjoy thir fill [...] Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust, [...] Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, [...] Among our other torments not the least, [...] 510 [...] Still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines; [...] Yet let me not forget what I have gain'd [...] From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: [...] One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call'd, [...] Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd'n? [...] Suspicious, reasonless. Why should thir Lord [...] Envie them that? can it be sin to know, [...] Can it be death? and do they onely stand [...] By Ignorance, is that thir happie state, [...] The proof of thir obedience and thir faith? [...] 520 [...] O fair foundation laid whereon to build [...] Thir ruine! Hence I will excite thir minds [...] With more desire to know, and to reject [...] Envious commands, invented with designe [...] To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt [...] Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such, [...] They taste and die: what likelier can ensue? [...] But first with narrow search I must walk round [...] This Garden, and no corner leave unspi'd; [...] A chance but chance may lead where I may meet [...] 530 [...] Some wandring Spirit of Heav'n, by Fountain side, [...] Or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw [...] What further would be learnt. Live while ye may, [...] Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return, [...] Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. [...] So saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd, [...] But with sly circumspection, and began [...] Through wood, through waste, o're hil, o're dale his roam. [...] Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav'n [...] With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun [...] 540 [...] Slowly descended, and with right aspect [...] Against the eastern Gate of Paradise [...] Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock [...] Of Alablaster, pil'd up to the Clouds, [...] Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent [...] Accessible from Earth, one entrance high; [...] The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung [...] Still as it rose, impossible to climbe. [...] Betwixt these rockie Pillars Gabriel sat [...] Chief of th' Angelic Guards, awaiting night; [...] 550 [...] About him exercis'd Heroic Games [...] Th' unarmed Youth of Heav'n, but nigh at hand [...] Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares [...] Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold. [...] Thither came Uriel, gliding through the Eeven [...] On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr [...] In Autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd [...] Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner [...] From what point of his Compass to beware [...] Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. [...] 560 [...] Gabriel, to thee thy cours by Lot hath giv'n [...] Charge and strict watch that to this happie place [...] No evil thing approach or enter in; [...] This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare [...] A Spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know [...] More of th' Almighties works, and chiefly Man [...] Gods latest Image: I describ'd his way [...] Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate; [...] But in the Mount that lies from Eden North, [...] Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks [...] 570 [...] Alien from Heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd: [...] Mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade [...] Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew [...] I fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise [...] New troubles; him thy care must be to find. [...] To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd: [...] Uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight, [...] Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst, [...] See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass [...] The vigilance here plac't, but such as come [...] 580 [...] Well known from Heav'n; and since Meridian hour [...] No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort, [...] So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds [...] On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude [...] Spiritual substance with corporeal barr. [...] But if within the circuit of these walks [...] In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom [...] Thou telst, by morrow dawning I shall know. [...] So promis'd hee, and Uriel to his charge [...] Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd [...] 590 [...] Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall'n [...] Beneath th' Azores; whither the prime Orb, [...] Incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd [...] Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth [...] By shorter flight to th' East, had left him there [...] Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold [...] The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend: [...] Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray [...] Had in her sober Liverie all things clad; [...] Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird, [...] 600 [...] They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests [...] Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale; [...] She all night long her amorous descant sung; [...] Silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the Firmament [...] With living Saphirs: Hesperus that led [...] The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon [...] Rising in clouded Majestie, at length [...] Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light, [...] And o're the dark her Silver Mantle threw. [...] When Adam thus to Eve: Fair Consort, th' hour [...] 610 [...] Of night, and all things now retir'd to rest [...] Mind us of like repose, since God hath set [...] Labour and rest, as day and night to men [...] Successive, and the timely dew of sleep [...] Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines [...] Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long [...] Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest; [...] Man hath his daily work of body or mind [...] Appointed, which declares his Dignitie, [...] And the regard of Heav'n on all his waies; [...] 620 [...] While other Animals unactive range, [...] And of thir doings God takes no account. [...] Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East [...] With first approach of light, we must be ris'n, [...] And at our pleasant labour, to reform [...] Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green, [...] Our walks at noon, with branches overgrown, [...] That mock our scant manuring, and require [...] More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth: [...] Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms, [...] 630 [...] That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth, [...] Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; [...] Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest. [...] To whom thus Eve with perfet beauty adornd. [...] My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst [...] Unargu'd I obey; so God ordains, [...] God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more [...] Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise. [...] With thee conversing I forget all time, [...] All seasons and thir change, all please alike. [...] 640 [...] Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, [...] With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun [...] When first on this delightful Land he spreads [...] His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour, [...] Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth [...] After soft showers; and sweet the coming on [...] Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night [...] With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon, [...] And these the Gemms of Heav'n, her starrie train: [...] But neither breath of Morn when she ascends [...] 650 [...] With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun [...] On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure, [...] Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, [...] Nor grateful Evening mild, nor silent Night [...] With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon, [...] Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet. [...] But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom [...] This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? [...] To whom our general Ancestor repli'd. [...] Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht Eve, [...] 660 [...] Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth, [...] By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land [...] In order, though to Nations yet unborn, [...] Ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise; [...] Least total darkness should by Night regaine [...] Her old possession, and extinguish life [...] In Nature and all things, which these soft fires [...] Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate [...] Of various influence foment and warme, [...] Temper or nourish, or in part shed down [...] 670 [...] Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow [...] On Earth, made hereby apter to receive [...] Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray. [...] These then, though unbeheld in deep of night, [...] Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, [...] That heav'n would want spectators, God want praise; [...] Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth [...] Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep: [...] All these with ceasless praise his works behold [...] Both day and night: how often from the steep [...] 680 [...] Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard [...] Celestial voices to the midnight air, [...] Sole, or responsive each to others note [...] Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands [...] While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk [...] With Heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds [...] In full harmonic number joind, thir songs [...] Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. [...] Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd [...] On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place [...] 690 [...] Chos'n by the sovran Planter, when he fram'd [...] All things to mans delightful use; the roofe [...] Of thickest covert was inwoven shade [...] Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew [...] Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side [...] Acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub [...] Fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, [...] Iris all hues, Roses, and Gessamin [...] Rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought [...] Mosaic; underfoot the Violet, [...] 700 [...] Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay [...] Broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone [...] Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here [...] Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none; [...] Such was thir awe of man. In shadier Bower [...] More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, [...] Pan or Silvanus never slept, nor Nymph, [...] Nor Faunus haunted. Here in close recess [...] With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs [...] Espoused Eve deckt first her Nuptial Bed, [...] 710 [...] And heav'nly Quires the Hymenaean sung, [...] What day the genial Angel to our Sire [...] Brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd, [...] More lovely then Pandora, whom the Gods [...] Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like [...] In sad event, when to the unwiser Son [...] Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnar'd [...] Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd [...] On him who had stole Joves authentic fire. [...] Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv'd, both stood, [...] 720 [...] Both turnd, and under op'n Skie ador'd [...] The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth & Heav'n [...] Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe [...] And starrie Pole: Thou also mad'st the Night, [...] Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day, [...] Which we in our appointed work imployd [...] Have finisht happie in our mutual help [...] And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss [...] Ordain'd by thee, and this delicious place [...] For us too large, where thy abundance wants [...] 730 [...] Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. [...] But thou hast promis'd from us two a Race [...] To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll [...] Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, [...] And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. [...] This said unanimous, and other Rites [...] Observing none, but adoration pure [...] Which God likes best, into thir inmost bower [...] Handed they went; and eas'd the putting off [...] These troublesom disguises which wee wear, [...] 740 [...] Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene [...] Adam from his fair Spouse, nor Eve the Rites [...] Mysterious of connubial Love refus'd: [...] Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk [...] Of puritie and place and innocence, [...] Defaming as impure what God declares [...] Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all. [...] Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain [...] But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man? [...] Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source [...] 750 [...] Of human ofspring, sole proprietie, [...] In Paradise of all things common else. [...] By thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men [...] Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee [...] Founded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure, [...] Relations dear, and all the Charities [...] Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known. [...] Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, [...] Or think thee unbefitting holiest place, [...] Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets, [...] 760 [...] Whose Bed is undefil'd and chast pronounc't, [...] Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us'd. [...] Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights [...] His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings, [...] Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile [...] Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, [...] Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours [...] Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal, [...] Or Serenate, which the starv'd Lover sings [...] To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. [...] 770 [...] These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept, [...] And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof [...] Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair'd. Sleep on, [...] Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek [...] No happier state, and know to know no more. [...] Now had night measur'd with her shaddowie Cone [...] Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault, [...] And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim [...] Forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd [...] To thir night watches in warlike Parade, [...] 780 [...] When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. [...] Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the South [...] With strictest watch; these other wheel the North, [...] Our circuit meets full West. As flame they part [...] Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear. [...] From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld [...] That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. [...] Ithuriel and Zephon, with wingd speed [...] Search through this Garden, leav unsearcht no nook, [...] But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge, [...] 790 [...] Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme. [...] This Eevning from the Sun's decline arriv'd [...] Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen [...] Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd [...] The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: [...] Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. [...] So saying, on he led his radiant Files, [...] Daz'ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct [...] In search of whom they sought: him there they found [...] Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of Eve; [...] 800 [...] Assaying by his Devilish art to reach [...] The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge [...] Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams, [...] Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint [...] Th' animal Spirits that from pure blood arise [...] Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise [...] At least distemperd, discontented thoughts, [...] Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires [...] Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride. [...] Him thus intent Ithuriel with his Spear [...] 810 [...] Touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure [...] Touch of Celestial temper, but returns [...] Of force to its own likeness: up he starts [...] Discoverd and surpriz'd. As when a spark [...] Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid [...] Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store [...] Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine [...] With sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the Aire: [...] So started up in his own shape the Fiend. [...] Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz'd [...] 820 [...] So sudden to behold the grieslie King; [...] Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. [...] Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg'd to Hell [...] Com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd, [...] Why satst thou like an enemie in waite [...] Here watching at the head of these that sleep? [...] Know ye not then said Satan, filld with scorn, [...] Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate [...] For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; [...] Not to know mee argues your selves unknown, [...] 830 [...] The lowest of your throng; or if ye know, [...] Why ask ye, and superfluous begin [...] Your message, like to end as much in vain? [...] To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. [...] Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, [...] Or undiminisht brightness, to be known [...] As when thou stoodst in Heav'n upright and pure; [...] That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good, [...] Departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now [...] Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. [...] 840 [...] But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account [...] To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep [...] This place inviolable, and these from harm. [...] So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke [...] Severe in youthful beautie, added grace [...] Invincible: abasht the Devil stood, [...] And felt how awful goodness is, and saw [...] Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd [...] His loss; but chiefly to find here observd [...] His lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd [...] 850 [...] Undaunted. If I must contend, said he, [...] Best with the best, the Sender not the sent, [...] Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, [...] Or less be lost. Thy fear, said Zephon bold, [...] Will save us trial what the least can doe [...] Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. [...] The Fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage; [...] But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on, [...] Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie [...] He held it vain; awe from above had quelld [...] 860 [...] His heart, not else dismai'd. Now drew they nigh [...] The western point, where those half-rounding guards [...] Just met, & closing stood in squadron joind [...] Awaiting next command. To whom thir Chief [...] Gabriel from the Front thus calld aloud. [...] O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet [...] Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne [...] Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade, [...] And with them comes a third of Regal port, [...] But faded splendor wan; who by his gate [...] 870 [...] And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, [...] Not likely to part hence without contest; [...] Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. [...] He scarce had ended, when those two approachd [...] And brief related whom they brought, wher found, [...] How busied, in what form and posture coucht. [...] To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. [...] Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescrib'd [...] To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge [...] Of others, who approve not to transgress [...] 880 [...] By thy example, but have power and right [...] To question thy bold entrance on this place; [...] Imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those [...] Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss? [...] To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow. [...] Gabriel, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise, [...] And such I held thee; but this question askt [...] Puts me in doubt. Lives ther who loves his pain? [...] Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, [...] Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, [...] 890 [...] And boldly venture to whatever place [...] Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change [...] Torment with ease, & soonest recompence [...] Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; [...] To thee no reason; who knowst only good, [...] But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object [...] His will who bound us? let him surer barr [...] His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay [...] In that dark durance: thus much what was askt. [...] The rest is true, they found me where they say; [...] 900 [...] But that implies not violence or harme. [...] Thus hee in scorn. The warlike Angel mov'd, [...] Disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd. [...] O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise, [...] Since Satan fell, whom follie overthrew, [...] And now returns him from his prison scap't, [...] Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise [...] Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither [...] Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib'd; [...] So wise he judges it to fly from pain [...] 910 [...] However, and to scape his punishment. [...] So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, [...] Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight [...] Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, [...] Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain [...] Can equal anger infinite provok't. [...] But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee [...] Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them [...] Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they [...] Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief, [...] 920 [...] The first in flight from pain, had'st thou alleg'd [...] To thy deserted host this cause of flight, [...] Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. [...] To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern. [...] Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, [...] Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood [...] Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide [...] The blasting volied Thunder made all speed [...] And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear. [...] But still thy words at random, as before, [...] 930 [...] Argue thy inexperience what behooves [...] From hard assaies and ill successes past [...] A faithful Leader, not to hazard all [...] Through wayes of danger by himself untri'd. [...] I therefore, I alone first undertook [...] To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie [...] This new created World, whereof in Hell [...] Fame is not silent, here in hope to find [...] Better abode, and my afflicted Powers [...] To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire; [...] 940 [...] Though for possession put to try once more [...] What thou and thy gay Legions dare against; [...] Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord [...] High up in Heav'n, with songs to hymne his Throne, [...] And practis'd distances to cringe, not fight. [...] To whom the warriour Angel soon repli'd. [...] To say and strait unsay, pretending first [...] Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie, [...] Argues no Leader, but a lyar trac't, [...] Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name, [...] 950 [...] O sacred name of faithfulness profan'd! [...] Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? [...] Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head; [...] Was this your discipline and faith ingag'd, [...] Your military obedience, to dissolve [...] Allegeance to th' acknowledg'd Power supream? [...] And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem [...] Patron of liberty, who more then thou [...] Once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd [...] Heav'ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope [...] 960 [...] To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? [...] But mark what I arreede thee now, avant; [...] Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre [...] Within these hallowd limits thou appeer, [...] Back to th' infernal pit I drag thee chaind, [...] And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne [...] The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. [...] So threatn'd hee, but Satan to no threats [...] Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd. [...] Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines, [...] 970 [...] Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then [...] Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel [...] From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King [...] Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers, [...] Us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels [...] In progress through the rode of Heav'n Star-pav'd. [...] While thus he spake, th' Angelic Squadron bright [...] Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes [...] Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round [...] With ported Spears, as thick as when a field [...] 980 [...] Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends [...] Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind [...] Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands [...] Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves [...] Prove chaff. On th' other side Satan allarm'd [...] Collecting all his might dilated stood, [...] Like Teneriff or Atlas unremov'd: [...] His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest [...] Sat horror Plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe [...] What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds [...] 990 [...] Might have ensu'd, nor onely Paradise [...] In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope [...] Of Heav'n perhaps, or all the Elements [...] At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne [...] With violence of this conflict, had not soon [...] Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid fray [...] Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen [...] Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion signe, [...] Wherein all things created first he weighd, [...] The pendulous round Earth with ballanc't Aire [...] 1000 [...] In counterpoise, now ponders all events, [...] Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights [...] The sequel each of parting and of fight; [...] The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; [...] Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. [...] Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, [...] Neither our own but giv'n; what follie then [...] To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more [...] Then Heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now [...] To trample thee as mire: for proof look up, [...] 1010 [...] And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign [...] Where thou art weigh'd, & shown how light, how weak, [...] If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew [...] His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled [...] Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.|$|E

[...] Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods [...] 90 [...] Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd. [...] Now was the Sun in Western cadence low [...] From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour [...] To fan the Earth now wak'd, and usher in [...] The Eevning <b>coole</b> when he from wrauth more <b>coole</b> [...] Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both [...] To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard [...] Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes [...] Brought to thir Ears, while day declin'd, they heard [...] And from his presence hid themselves among [...] 100 [...] The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God [...] Approaching, thus to Adam call'd aloud. [...] Where art thou Adam, wont with joy to meet [...] My coming seen far off? I miss thee here, [...] Not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude, [...] Where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught: [...] Or come I less conspicuous, or what change [...] Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth. [...] He came, and with him Eve, more loth, though first [...] To offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd; [...] 110 [...] Love was not in thir looks, either to God [...] Or to each other, but apparent guilt, [...] And shame, and perturbation, and despaire, [...] Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile. [...] Whence Adam faultring long, thus answer'd brief. [...] I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice [...] Affraid, being naked, hid my self. To whom [...] The gracious Judge without revile repli'd. [...] My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd, [...] But still rejoyc't, how is it now become [...] 120 [...] So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who [...] Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree [...] Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? [...] To whom thus Adam sore beset repli'd. [...] O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand [...] Before my Judge, either to undergoe [...] My self the total Crime, or to accuse [...] My other self, the partner of my life; [...] Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines, [...] I should conceal, and not expose to blame [...] 130 [...] By my complaint; but strict necessitie [...] Subdues me, and calamitous constraint, [...] Least on my head both sin and punishment, [...] However insupportable, be all [...] Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou [...] Wouldst easily detect what I conceale. [...] This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help, [...] And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good, [...] So fit, so acceptable, so Divine, [...] That from her hand I could suspect no ill, [...] 140 [...] And what she did, whatever in it self, [...] Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed; [...] Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate. [...] To whom the sovran Presence thus repli'd. [...] Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey [...] Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, [...] Superior, or but equal, that to her [...] Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place [...] Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, [...] And for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd [...] 150 [...] Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd [...] She was indeed, and lovely to attract [...] Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts [...] Were such as under Government well seem'd, [...] Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part [...] And person, had'st thou known thy self aright. [...] So having said, he thus to Eve in few: [...] Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done? [...] To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelm'd, [...] Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge [...] 160 [...] Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd. [...] The Serpent me beguil'd and I did eate. [...] Which when the Lord God heard, without delay [...] To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd [...] Serpent though brute, unable to transferre [...] The Guilt on him who made him instrument [...] Of mischief, and polluted from the end [...] Of his Creation; justly then accurst, [...] As vitiated in Nature: more to know [...] Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew) [...] 170 [...] Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last [...] To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd, [...] Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best: [...] And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. [...] Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst [...] Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field; [...] Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe, [...] And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life. [...] Between Thee and the Woman I will put [...] Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed; [...] 180 [...] Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. [...] So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd [...] When Jesus son of Mary second Eve, [...] Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n, [...] Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave [...] Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht [...] In open shew, and with ascention bright [...] Captivity led captive through the Aire, [...] The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt, [...] Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; [...] 190 [...] Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, [...] And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd. [...] Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie [...] By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring [...] In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will [...] Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. [...] On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc'd. [...] Because thou hast heark'nd {{to the voice of}} thy Wife, [...] And eaten of the Tree concerning which [...] I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, [...] 200 [...] Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow [...] Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; [...] Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth [...] Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field, [...] In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread, [...] Till thou return unto the ground, for thou [...] Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, [...] For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. [...] So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, [...] And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day [...] 210 [...] Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood [...] Before him naked to the aire, that now [...] Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin [...] Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume, [...] As when he wash'd his servants feet, so now [...] As Father of his Familie he clad [...] Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, [...] Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid; [...] And thought not much to cloath his Enemies: [...] Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins [...] 220 [...] Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more [...] Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness, [...] Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight. [...] To him with swift ascent he up returnd, [...] Into his blissful bosom reassum'd [...] In glory as of old, to him appeas'd [...] All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man [...] Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. [...] Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth, [...] Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, [...] 230 [...] In counterview within the Gates, that now [...] Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame [...] Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass'd through, [...] Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. [...] O Son, why sit we here each other viewing [...] Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives [...] In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides [...] For us his ofspring deare? It cannot be [...] But that success attends him; if mishap, [...] Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n [...] 240 [...] By his Avenger, since no place like this [...] Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. [...] Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, [...] Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large [...] Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on, [...] Or sympathie, or som connatural force [...] Powerful at greatest distance to unite [...] With secret amity things of like kinde [...] By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade [...] Inseparable must with mee along: [...] 250 [...] For Death from Sin no power can separate. [...] But least the difficultie of passing back [...] Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe [...] Impassable, impervious, let us try [...] Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine [...] Not unagreeable, to found a path [...] Over this Maine from Hell to that new World [...] Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument [...] Of merit high to all th' infernal Host, [...] Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, [...] 260 [...] Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. [...] Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn [...] By this new felt attraction and instinct. [...] Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon. [...] Goe whither Fate and inclination strong [...] Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre [...] The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw [...] Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste [...] The savour of Death from all things there that live: [...] Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest [...] 270 [...] Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. [...] So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell [...] Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock [...] Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, [...] Against the day of Battel, to a Field, [...] Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd [...] With sent of living Carcasses design'd [...] For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. [...] So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd [...] His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, [...] 280 [...] Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr. [...] Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste [...] Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark [...] Flew divers, & with Power (thir Power was great) [...] Hovering upon the Waters; what they met [...] Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea [...] Tost up and down, together crowded drove [...] From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. [...] As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse [...] Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive [...] 290 [...] Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way [...] Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich [...] Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle [...] Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, [...] As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm [...] As Delos floating once; the rest his look [...] Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move, [...] And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate, [...] Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach [...] They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on [...] 300 [...] Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge [...] Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall [...] Immoveable of this now fenceless world [...] Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, [...] Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell. [...] So, if great things to small may be compar'd, [...] Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke, [...] From Susa his Memnonian Palace high [...] Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont [...] Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn'd, [...] 310 [...] And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves. [...] Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art [...] Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock [...] Over the vext Abyss, following the track [...] Of Satan, to the selfsame place where hee [...] First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe [...] From out of Chaos to the outside bare [...] Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant [...] And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made [...] And durable; and now in little space [...] 320 [...] The Confines met of Empyrean Heav'n [...] And of this World, and on the left hand Hell [...] With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes [...] In sight, to each of these three places led. [...] And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd, [...] To Paradise first tending, when behold [...] Satan in likeness of an Angel bright [...] Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing [...] His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose: [...] Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear [...] 330 [...] Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise. [...] Hee, after Eve seduc't, unminded slunk [...] Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape [...] To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act [...] By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded [...] Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought [...] Vain covertures; but when he saw descend [...] The Son of God to judge them, terrifi'd [...] Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun [...] The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth [...] 340 [...] Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd [...] By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire [...] Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, [...] Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood [...] Not instant, but of future time. With joy [...] And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd, [...] And at the brink of Chaos, neer the foot [...] Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't [...] Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear. [...] Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight [...] 350 [...] Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd. [...] Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire [...] Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. [...] O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, [...] Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own, [...] Thou art thir Author and prime Architect: [...] For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd, [...] My Heart, which by a secret harmonie [...] Still moves with thine, joyn'd in connexion sweet, [...] That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks [...] 360 [...] Now also evidence, but straight I felt [...] Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt [...] That I must after thee with this thy Son; [...] Such fatal consequence unites us three: [...] Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, [...] Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure [...] Detain from following thy illustrious track. [...] Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd [...] Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow'rd [...] To fortifie thus farr, and overlay [...] 370 [...] With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. [...] Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won [...] What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd [...] With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd [...] Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, [...] There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, [...] As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World [...] Retiring, by his own doom alienated, [...] And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide [...] Of all things, parted by th' Empyreal bounds, [...] 380 [...] His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, [...] Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne. [...] Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad. [...] Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both, [...] High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race [...] Of Satan (for I glorie in the name, [...] Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King) [...] Amply have merited of me, of all [...] Th' Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore [...] Triumphal with triumphal act have met, [...] 390 [...] Mine with this glorious Work, & made one Realm [...] Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent [...] Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I [...] Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease [...] To my associate Powers, them to acquaint [...] With these successes, and with them rejoyce, [...] You two this way, among those numerous Orbs [...] All yours, right down to Paradise descend; [...] There dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth [...] Dominion exercise and in the Aire, [...] 400 [...] Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd, [...] Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. [...] My Substitutes I send ye, and Create [...] Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might [...] Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now [...] My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, [...] Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit. [...] If your joynt power prevaile, th' affaires of Hell [...] No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. [...] So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed [...] 410 [...] Thir course through thickest Constellations held [...] Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, [...] And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips [...] Then sufferd. Th' other way Satan went down [...] The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side [...] Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd, [...] And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, [...] That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate, [...] Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass'd, [...] And all about found desolate; for those [...] 420 [...] Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, [...] Flown to the upper World; the rest were all [...] Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls [...] Of Pandemonium, Citie and proud seate [...] Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld, [...] Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond. [...] There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand [...] In Council sate, sollicitous what chance [...] Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee [...] Departing gave command, and they observ'd. [...] 430 [...] As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe [...] By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines [...] Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes [...] Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond [...] The Realme of Aladule, in his retreate [...] To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late [...] Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell [...] Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch [...] Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting [...] Each hour their great adventurer from the search [...] 440 [...] Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, [...] In shew plebeian Angel militant [...] Of lowest order, past; and from the dore [...] Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible [...] Ascended his high Throne, which under state [...] Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end [...] Was plac't in regal lustre. Down a while [...] He sate, and round about him saw unseen: [...] At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head [...] And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad [...] 450 [...] With what permissive glory since his fall [...] Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd [...] At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng [...] Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld, [...] Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime: [...] Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers, [...] Rais'd from thir dark Divan, and with like joy [...] Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand [...] Silence, and with these words attention won. [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] 460 [...] For in possession such, not onely of right, [...] I call ye and declare ye now, returnd [...] Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth [...] Triumphant out of this infernal Pit [...] Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, [...] And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, [...] As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven [...] Little inferiour, by my adventure hard [...] With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell [...] What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine [...] 470 [...] Voyag'd the unreal, vast, unbounded deep [...] Of horrible confusion, over which [...] By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd [...] To expedite your glorious march; but I [...] Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride [...] Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb [...] Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, [...] That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd [...] My journey strange, with clamorous uproare [...] Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found [...] 480 [...] The new created World, which fame in Heav'n [...] Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful [...] Of absolute perfection, therein Man [...] Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile [...] Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd [...] From his Creator, and the more to increase [...] Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat [...] Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up [...] Both his beloved Man and all his World, [...] To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, [...] 490 [...] Without our hazard, labour or allarme, [...] To range in, and to dwell, and over Man [...] To rule, as over all he should have rul'd. [...] True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather [...] Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape [...] Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, [...] Is enmity, which he will put between [...] Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; [...] His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: [...] A World who would not purchase with a bruise, [...] 500 [...] Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account [...] Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods, [...] But up and enter now into full bliss. [...] So having said, a while he stood, expecting [...] Thir universal shout and high applause [...] To fill his eare, when contrary he hears [...] On all sides, from innumerable tongues [...] A dismal universal hiss, the sound [...] Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long [...] Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; [...] 510 [...] His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, [...] His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining [...] Each other, till supplanted down he fell [...] A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, [...] Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power [...] Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, [...] According to his doom: he would have spoke, [...] But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue [...] To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd [...] Alike, to Serpents all as accessories [...] 520 [...] To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din [...] Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now [...] With complicated monsters, head and taile, [...] Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, [...] Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, [...] And Dipsas (Not so thick swarm'd once the Soil [...] Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle [...] Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, [...] Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun [...] Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, [...] 530 [...] Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem'd [...] Above the rest still to retain; they all [...] Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field, [...] Where all yet left of that revolted Rout [...] Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, [...] Sublime with expectation when to see [...] In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; [...] They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd [...] Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, [...] And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, [...] 540 [...] They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, [...] Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, [...] And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form [...] Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, [...] As in thir crime. Thus was th' applause they meant, [...] Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame [...] Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood [...] A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, [...] His will who reigns above, to aggravate [...] Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that [...] 550 [...] Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve [...] Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange [...] Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining [...] For one forbidden Tree a multitude [...] Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; [...] Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, [...] Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, [...] But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees [...] Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks [...] That curld Megaera: greedily they pluck'd [...] 560 [...] The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew [...] Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam'd; [...] This more delusive, not the touch, but taste [...] Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay [...] Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit [...] Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste [...] With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, [...] Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, [...] With hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws [...] With foot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell [...] 570 [...] Into the same illusion, not as Man [...] Whom they triumph'd once lapst. Thus were they plagu'd [...] And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, [...] Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, [...] Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo [...] This annual humbling certain number'd days, [...] To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't. [...] However some tradition they dispers'd [...] Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, [...] And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld [...] 580 [...] Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- [...] Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule [...] Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv'n [...] And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. [...] Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair [...] Too soon arriv'd, Sin there in power before, [...] Once actual, now in body, and to dwell [...] Habitual habitant; behind her Death [...] Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet [...] On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. [...] 590 [...] Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death, [...] What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd [...] With travail difficult, not better farr [...] Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, [...] Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? [...] Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon. [...] To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, [...] Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, [...] There best, where most with ravin I may meet; [...] Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems [...] 600 [...] To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. [...] To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd. [...] Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours [...] Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, [...] No homely morsels, and whatever thing [...] The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd, [...] Till I in Man residing through the Race, [...] His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, [...] And season him thy last and sweetest prey. [...] This said, they both betook them several wayes, [...] 610 [...] Both to destroy, or unimmortal make [...] All kinds, and for destruction to mature [...] Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing, [...] From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, [...] To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. [...] See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance [...] To waste and havoc yonder World, which I [...] So fair and good created, and had still [...] Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man [...] Let in these wastful Furies, who impute [...] 620 [...] Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell [...] And his Adherents, that with so much ease [...] I suffer them to enter and possess [...] A place so heav'nly, and conniving seem [...] To gratifie my scornful Enemies, [...] That laugh, as if transported with some fit [...] Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, [...] At random yeilded up to their misrule; [...] And know not that I call'd and drew them thither [...] My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth [...] 630 [...] Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed [...] On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst [...] With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling [...] Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, [...] Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last [...] Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell [...] For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. [...] Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure [...] To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: [...] Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes. [...] 640 [...] Hee ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud [...] Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas, [...] Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, [...] Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; [...] Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, [...] Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom [...] New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, [...] Or down from Heav'n descend. Such was thir song, [...] While the Creator calling forth by name [...] His mightie Angels gave them several charge, [...] 650 [...] As sorted best with present things. The Sun [...] Had first his precept so to move, so shine, [...] As might affect the Earth with cold and heat [...] Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call [...] Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring [...] Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone [...] Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five [...] Thir planetarie motions and aspects [...] In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite, [...] Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne [...] 660 [...] In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt [...] Thir influence malignant when to showre, [...] Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, [...] Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set [...] Thir corners, when with bluster to confound [...] Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle [...] With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. [...] Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse [...] The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more [...] From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd [...] 670 [...] Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun [...] Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode [...] Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav'n [...] Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins [...] Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine [...] By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, [...] As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change [...] Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring [...] Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours, [...] Equal in Days and Nights, except to those [...] 680 [...] Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day [...] Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun [...] To recompence his distance, in thir sight [...] Had rounded still th' Horizon, and not known [...] Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow [...] From cold Estotiland, and South as farr [...] Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit [...] The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn'd [...] His course intended; else how had the World [...] Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, [...] 690 [...] Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? [...] These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd [...] Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, [...] Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, [...] Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North [...] Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar [...] Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice [...] And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, [...] Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud [...] And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn; [...] 700 [...] With adverse blast up-turns them from the South [...] Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds [...] From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce [...] Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes [...] Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise, [...] Sirocco, and Libecchio. Thus began [...] Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first [...] Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational, [...] Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie: [...] Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle, [...] 710 [...] And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, [...] Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe [...] Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim [...] Glar'd on him passing: these were from without [...] The growing miseries, which Adam saw [...] Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, [...] To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, [...] And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost, [...] Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. [...] O miserable of happie! is this the end [...] 720 [...] Of this new glorious World, and mee so late [...] The Glory of that Glory, who now becom [...] Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face [...] Of God, whom to behold was then my highth [...] Of happiness: yet well, if here would end [...] The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare [...] My own deservings; but this will not serve; [...] All that I eate or drink, or shall beget, [...] Is propagated curse. O voice once heard [...] Delightfully, Encrease And Multiply, [...] 730 [...] Now death to heare! for what can I encrease [...] Or multiplie, but curses on my head? [...] Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling [...] The evil on him brought by me, will curse [...] My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, [...] For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks [...] Shall be the execration; so besides [...] Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee [...] Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, [...] On mee as on thir natural center light [...] 740 [...] Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes [...] Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! [...] Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay [...] To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee [...] From darkness to promote me, or here place [...] In this delicious Garden? as my Will [...] Concurd not to my being, it were but right [...] And equal to reduce me to my dust, [...] Desirous to resigne, and render back [...] All I receav'd, unable to performe [...] 750 [...] Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold [...] The good I sought not. To the loss of that, [...] Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added [...] The sense of endless woes? inexplicable [...] Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, [...] I thus contest; then should have been refusd [...] Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd: [...] Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, [...] Then cavil the conditions? and though God [...] Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son [...] 760 [...] Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort, [...] Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: [...] Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee [...] That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, [...] But Natural necessity begot. [...] God made thee of choice his own, and of his own [...] To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, [...] Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. [...] Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, [...] That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: [...] 770 [...] O welcom hour whenever! why delayes [...] His hand to execute what his Decree [...] Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, [...] Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out [...] To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet [...] Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth [...] Insensible, how glad would lay me down [...] As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest [...] And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more [...] Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse [...] 780 [...] To mee and to my ofspring would torment me [...] With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt [...] Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, [...] Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man [...] Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish [...] With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, [...] Or in some other dismal place, who knows [...] But I shall die a living Death? O thought [...] Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath [...] Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life [...] 790 [...] And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. [...] All of me then shall die: let this appease [...] The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. [...] For though the Lord of all be infinite, [...] Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, [...] But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise [...] Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? [...] Can he make deathless Death? that were to make [...] Strange contradiction, which to God himself [...] Impossible is held, as Argument [...] 800 [...] Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, [...] For angers sake, finite to infinite [...] In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour [...] Satisfi'd never; that were to extend [...] His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, [...] By which all Causes else according still [...] To the reception of thir matter act, [...] Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare. But say [...] That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd, [...] Bereaving sense, but endless miserie [...] 810 [...] From this day onward, which I feel begun [...] Both in me, and without me, and so last [...] To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear [...] Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution [...] On my defensless head; both Death and I [...] Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, [...] Nor I on my part single, in mee all [...] Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie [...] That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able [...] To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! [...] 820 [...] So disinherited how would ye bless [...] Me now your Curse! Ah, why should all mankind [...] For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd, [...] If guiltless? But from mee what can proceed, [...] But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd, [...] Not to do onely, but to will the same [...] With me? how can they acquitted stand [...] In sight of God? Him after all Disputes [...] Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain [...] And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still [...] 830 [...] But to my own conviction: first and last [...] On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring [...] Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; [...] So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support [...] That burden heavier then the Earth to bear, [...] Then all the world much heavier, though divided [...] With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir'st, [...] And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope [...] Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable [...] Beyond all past example and future, [...] 840 [...] To Satan onely like both crime and doom. [...] O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears [...] And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which [...] I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! [...] Thus Adam to himself lamented loud [...] Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell, [...] Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air [...] Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, [...] Which to his evil Conscience represented [...] All things with double terror: On the ground [...] 850 [...] Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft [...] Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd [...] Of tardie execution, since denounc't [...] The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, [...] Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke [...] To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, [...] Justice Divine not hast'n to be just? [...] But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine [...] Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. [...] O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, [...] 860 [...] With other echo farr I taught your Shades [...] To answer, and resound farr other Song. [...] Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld, [...] Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, [...] Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: [...] But her with stern regard he thus repell'd. [...] Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best [...] Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false [...] And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, [...] Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew [...] 870 [...] Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee [...] Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended [...] To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee [...] I had persisted happie, had not thy pride [...] And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, [...] Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd [...] Not to be trusted, longing to be seen [...] Though by the Devil himself, him overweening [...] To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting [...] Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee, [...] 880 [...] To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise, [...] Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, [...] And understood not all was but a shew [...] Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib [...] Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, [...] More to the part sinister from me drawn, [...] Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie [...] To my just number found. O why did God, [...] Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n [...] With Spirits Masculine, create at last [...] 890 [...] This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect [...] Of Nature, and not fill the World at once [...] With Men as Angels without Feminine, [...] Or find some other way to generate [...] Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, [...] And more that shall befall, innumerable [...] Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, [...] And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either [...] He never shall find out fit Mate, but such [...] As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, [...] 900 [...] Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain [...] Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind [...] By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld [...] By Parents, or his happiest choice too late [...] Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound [...] To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: [...] Which infinite calamitie shall cause [...] To humane life, and houshold peace confound. [...] He added not, and from her turn'd, but Eve [...] Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing, [...] 910 [...] And tresses all disorderd, at his feet [...] Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught [...] His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. [...] Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav'n [...] What love sincere, and reverence in my heart [...] I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, [...] Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant [...] I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, [...] Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, [...] Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, [...] 920 [...] My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, [...] Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? [...] While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, [...] Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, [...] As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie [...] Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us, [...] That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not [...] Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n, [...] On me already lost, mee then thy self [...] More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou [...] 930 [...] Against God onely, I against God and thee, [...] And to the place of judgement will return, [...] There with my cries importune Heaven, that all [...] The sentence from thy head remov'd may light [...] On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, [...] Mee mee onely just object of his ire. [...] She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, [...] Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault [...] Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in Adam wraught [...] Commiseration; soon his heart relented [...] 940 [...] Towards her, his life so late and sole delight, [...] Now at his feet submissive in distress, [...] Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, [...] His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide; [...] As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost, [...] And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. [...] Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, [...] So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st [...] The punishment all on thy self; alas, [...] Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine [...] 950 [...] His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, [...] And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers [...] Could alter high Decrees, I to that place [...] Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, [...] That on my head all might be visited, [...] Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n, [...] To me committed and by me expos'd. [...] But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame [...] Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive [...] In offices of Love, how we may light'n [...] 960 [...] Each others burden in our share of woe; [...] Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see, [...] Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill, [...] A long days dying to augment our paine, [...] And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd. [...] To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli'd. [...] Adam, by sad experiment I know [...] How little weight my words with thee can finde, [...] Found so erroneous, thence by just event [...] Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, [...] 970 [...] Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place [...] Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine [...] Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart, [...] Living or dying from thee I will not hide [...] What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n, [...] Tending to som relief of our extremes, [...] Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, [...] As in our evils, and of easier choice. [...] If care of our descent perplex us most, [...] Which must be born to certain woe, devourd [...] 980 [...] By Death at last, and miserable it is [...] To be to others cause of misery, [...] Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring [...] Into this cursed World a woful Race, [...] That after wretched Life must be at last [...] Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power [...] It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent [...] The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. [...] Childless thou art, Childless remaine: [...] So Death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two [...] 990 [...] Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw. [...] But if thou judge it hard and difficult, [...] Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain [...] From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet, [...] And with desire to languish without hope, [...] Before the present object languishing [...] With like desire, which would be miserie [...] And torment less then none of what we dread, [...] Then both our selves and Seed at once to free [...] From what we fear for both, let us make short, [...] 1000 [...] Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply [...] With our own hands his Office on our selves; [...] Why stand we longer shivering under feares, [...] That shew no end but Death, and have the power, [...] Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing, [...] Destruction with destruction to destroy. [...] She ended heer, or vehement despaire [...] Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts [...] Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale. [...] But Adam with such counsel nothing sway'd, [...] 1010 [...] To better hopes his more attentive minde [...] Labouring had rais'd, and thus to Eve repli'd. [...] Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems [...] To argue in thee somthing more sublime [...] And excellent then what thy minde contemnes; [...] But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes [...] That excellence thought in thee, and implies, [...] Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret [...] For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd. [...] Or if thou covet death, as utmost end [...] 1020 [...] Of miserie, so thinking to evade [...] The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God [...] Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so [...] To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death [...] So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine [...] We are by doom to pay; rather such acts [...] Of contumacie will provoke the highest [...] To make death in us live: Then let us seek [...] Som safer resolution, which methinks [...] I have in view, calling to minde with heed [...] 1030 [...] Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise [...] The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless [...] Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe [...] Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd [...] Against us this deceit: to crush his head [...] Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost [...] By death brought on our selves, or childless days [...] Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe [...] Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee [...] Instead shall double ours upon our heads. [...] 1040 [...] No more be mention'd then of violence [...] Against our selves, and wilful barrenness, [...] That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely [...] Rancor and pride, impatience and despite, [...] Reluctance against God and his just yoke [...] Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild [...] And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd [...] Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected [...] Immediate dissolution, which we thought [...] Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee [...] 1050 [...] Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold, [...] And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy, [...] Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope [...] Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne [...] My bread; what harm? Idleness had bin worse; [...] My labour will sustain me; and least Cold [...] Or Heat should injure us, his timely care [...] Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands [...] Cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd; [...] How much more, if we pray him, will his ear [...] 1060 [...] Be open, and his heart to pitie incline, [...] And teach us further by what means to shun [...] Th' inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow, [...] Which now the Skie with various Face begins [...] To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds [...] Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks [...] Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek [...] Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish [...] Our Limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal Starr [...] Leave cold the Night, how we his gather'd beams [...] 1070 [...] Reflected, may with matter sere foment, [...] Or by collision of two bodies grinde [...] The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds [...] Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock [...] Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down [...] Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine, [...] And sends a comfortable heat from farr, [...] Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use, [...] And what may else be remedie or cure [...] To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, [...] 1080 [...] Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace [...] Beseeching him, so as we need not fear [...] To pass commodiously this life, sustain'd [...] By him with many comforts, till we end [...] In dust, our final rest and native home. [...] What better can we do, then to the place [...] Repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall [...] Before him reverent, and there confess [...] Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears [...] Watering the ground, and with our sighs the Air [...] 1090 [...] Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign [...] Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek. [...] Undoubtedly he will relent and turn [...] From his displeasure; in whose look serene, [...] When angry most he seem'd and most severe, [...] What else but favor, grace, and mercie shon? [...] So spake our Father penitent, nor Eve [...] Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place [...] Repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell [...] Before him reverent, and both confess'd [...] 1100 [...] Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears [...] Watering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air [...] Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign [...] Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.|$|E
