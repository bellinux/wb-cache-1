5|$|The <b>capacitor</b> is a {{development}} of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance. The unit of capacitance is the farad, named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol F: one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A <b>capacitor</b> connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the <b>capacitor</b> fills, eventually falling to zero. A <b>capacitor</b> will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.|$|E
5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a <b>capacitor,</b> hence {{mechanical component}}s are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E

25|$|Electrolytic <b>capacitors</b> {{for special}} {{applications}} include motor start <b>capacitors,</b> flashlight <b>capacitors</b> and audio frequency <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Individual photons can be {{detected}} by several methods. The classic photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. Semiconductor charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic <b>capacitor</b> that can {{be detected}}. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of conductivity of the gas.|$|E
5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial <b>capacitor</b> banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E
5|$|Resonance was noticed {{early on}} in {{experiments}} with the Leyden jar, invented in 1746. The Leyden jar stores electricity due to its capacitance, and is, in fact, an early form of <b>capacitor.</b> When a Leyden jar is discharged by allowing a spark to jump between the electrodes, the discharge is oscillatory. This was not suspected until 1826, when Felix Savary in France, and later (1842) Joseph Henry in the US noted that a steel needle placed close to the discharge does not always magnetise in the same direction. They both independently drew the conclusion {{that there was a}} transient oscillation dying with time.|$|E
25|$|Some ceramic <b>capacitors</b> {{of special}} shapes and styles {{are used as}} <b>capacitors</b> for special applications, {{including}} RFI/EMI suppression <b>capacitors</b> for connection to supply mains, also known as safety <b>capacitors,</b> X2Y® and three-terminal <b>capacitors</b> for bypassing and decoupling applications, feed-through <b>capacitors</b> for noise suppression by low-pass filters and ceramic power <b>capacitors</b> for transmitters and HF applications.|$|R
25|$|Film <b>capacitors,</b> {{plastic film}} <b>capacitors,</b> film {{dielectric}} <b>capacitors,</b> or polymer film <b>capacitors,</b> generically called “film caps” {{as well as}} power film <b>capacitors,</b> are electrical <b>capacitors</b> with an insulating plastic film as the dielectric, sometimes combined with paper as carrier of the electrodes.|$|R
25|$|For simple higher-frequency filter circuits, or in voltage {{regulator}} or voltage doubler circuits, low-cost metallized polyester film <b>capacitors</b> provide long-term stability, and can replace more-expensive tantalum <b>capacitors.</b> Because <b>capacitors</b> pass AC signals but block DC, film <b>capacitors</b> with their high insulation resistance and low self-inductance are well-suited as signal coupling <b>capacitors</b> for higher frequencies. For similar reasons, film <b>capacitors</b> {{are widely used}} as decoupling <b>capacitors</b> to suppress noise or transients.|$|R
5|$|The coil of the {{transducer}} adds some inductance on {{the electrical}} {{side of the}} filter. It is common practice to add a <b>capacitor</b> in parallel with the coil so that an additional resonator is formed which {{can be incorporated into}} the filter design. While this will not improve performance to the extent that an additional mechanical resonator would, there is some benefit and the coil has to be there in any case.|$|E
5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (<b>capacitor</b> or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.|$|E
5|$|TransÉnergie uses series {{compensation}} {{to alter the}} way electricity behaves in power transmission lines, which improves the electricity transmission efficiency. This reduces the need to construct new power lines and increases the amount of electric power sent to population centres. Series compensation is based on <b>capacitor</b> technology. To maintain its transmission system performance, TransÉnergie sets aside funds for research and application of new technologies. In addition to power transmission technology, Hydro-Québec plans to offer high-speed internet over its transmission lines within a few years; the utility started testing internet over its lines in January 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{overlapping}} {{categories of}} film and power <b>capacitors</b> are visible when they are applied as snubber <b>capacitors</b> in the growing market for high power electronics with IGBT’s and thyristors. Although the power <b>capacitors</b> use polypropylene film, like the smaller snubber film <b>capacitors,</b> they belong {{to the family of}} power <b>capacitors,</b> and are called “damping” <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
25|$|Ceramic <b>capacitors</b> {{of special}} shapes and styles {{are used as}} <b>capacitors</b> for RFI/EMI suppression, as {{feed-through}} <b>capacitors</b> and in larger dimensions as power <b>capacitors</b> for transmitters.|$|R

5|$|Planning of the ZX Spectrum+ {{started in}} June 1984, {{and it was}} {{released}} in October the same year. This 48KB Spectrum (development code-name TB) introduced a new QL-style case with an injection-moulded keyboard and a reset button that was basically a switch that shorted across the CPU reset <b>capacitor.</b> Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48KB model. It was possible {{to change the system}} boards between the original case and the Spectrum+ case. It retailed for £179.95. A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was available. Early on, the machine outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more usual 5–6% for the older model.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and <b>capacitor</b> elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E
25|$|Comparing the {{capacitors}} {{from the}} table with a supercapacitor, the highest energy density <b>capacitor</b> family. For this, the <b>capacitor</b> 25nbsp& F/2.3nbsp&V in dimensions D × H = 16nbsp&mm × 26nbsp&mm from Maxwell HC Series, compared with the electrolytic <b>capacitor</b> of approximately equal size in the table. This supercapacitor has roughly 5000 times higher capacitance than the 4700/10 electrolytic <b>capacitor</b> but ¼ of the voltage and has about 66,000nbsp&mWs (0.018nbsp&Wh) stored electrical energy, approximately 100 times higher energy density (40 to 280 times) than the electrolytic <b>capacitor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{dissipation}} factor of PP film <b>capacitors</b> {{is smaller than}} that of other film <b>capacitors.</b> Due to the low and very stable {{dissipation factor}} over a wide temperature and frequency range, even at very high frequencies, and their high dielectric strength of 650nbsp&V/µm, PP film <b>capacitors</b> {{can be used in}} metallized and in film/foil versions as <b>capacitors</b> for pulse applications, such as CRT-scan deflection circuits, or as so-called [...] "snubber" [...] <b>capacitors,</b> or in IGBT applications. In addition, polypropylene film <b>capacitors</b> are used in AC power applications, such as motor run <b>capacitors</b> or PFC <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Run <b>capacitors</b> are {{designed}} for continuous duty while the motor is powered, which is why electrolytic <b>capacitors</b> are avoided, and low-loss polymer <b>capacitors</b> are used. Run <b>capacitors</b> are mostly polypropylene film <b>capacitors</b> and are energized the entire time the motor is running. Run <b>capacitors</b> are rated {{in a range of}} 1.5 to 100 µF, with voltage classifications of 370 V or 440 V.|$|R

Class 2 ceramic <b>capacitors</b> have an Rins &ge; 4,000 MΩ for <b>capacitors</b> with CR &le; 25 nF or &tau;s &ge; 100 s for <b>capacitors</b> with CR > 25 nF.|$|R
25|$|Cost of a PPS film <b>capacitor</b> {{is usually}} higher {{compared}} to a PP film <b>capacitor.</b>|$|E
25|$|In general, a <b>capacitor</b> {{is seen as}} {{a storage}} {{component}} for electric energy. But this is only one <b>capacitor</b> function. A <b>capacitor</b> can also act as an AC resistor. In many cases the <b>capacitor</b> is used as a decoupling <b>capacitor</b> to filter or bypass undesired biased AC frequencies to the ground. Other applications use capacitors for capacitive coupling of AC signals; the dielectric is used only for blocking DC. For such applications the AC resistance {{is as important as the}} capacitance value.|$|E
25|$|In most CFLs the {{filaments}} {{are connected}} in series, {{with a small}} <b>capacitor</b> between them. The discharge, once lit, is in parallel to the <b>capacitor</b> and presents a lower-resistance path, effectively shorting the <b>capacitor</b> out.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dissipation}} factor of PP film <b>capacitors</b> {{is smaller than}} that of other film <b>capacitors.</b> Due to the low and very stable {{dissipation factor}} over a wide temperature and frequency range, even at very high frequencies, and their high dielectric strength of 650 V/µm, PP film <b>capacitors</b> {{can be used in}} metallized and in film/foil versions as <b>capacitors</b> for pulse applications, such as CRT-scan deflection circuits, or as so-called [...] "snubber" [...] <b>capacitors,</b> or in IGBT applications.

25|$|Film power <b>capacitors</b> mostly use {{polypropylene}} film as the dielectric. Other types include metallized paper <b>capacitors</b> (MP <b>capacitors)</b> and mixed dielectric film <b>capacitors</b> with polypropylene dielectrics. MP <b>capacitors</b> serve for cost applications and as field-free carrier electrodes (soggy foil <b>capacitors)</b> for high AC or high current pulse loads. Windings can {{be filled with}} an insulating oil or with epoxy resin to reduce air bubbles, thereby preventing short circuits.|$|R
25|$|Most power <b>capacitors,</b> {{the largest}} <b>capacitors</b> made, {{generally}} use polypropylene film as the dielectric.

25|$|By {{replacing}} each inductor with a <b>capacitor</b> {{and each}} <b>capacitor</b> with an inductor, a high-pass Butterworth filter is obtained.|$|E
25|$|In {{the reverse}} microphonic effect, the varying {{electric}} field between the <b>capacitor</b> plates exerts a physical force, moving {{them as a}} speaker. High current impulse loads or high ripple currents can generate audible acoustic sound coming from the <b>capacitor,</b> but discharges the <b>capacitor</b> and stresses the dielectric.|$|E
25|$|A <b>capacitor</b> can possess spring-like {{qualities in}} an {{oscillator}} circuit.
