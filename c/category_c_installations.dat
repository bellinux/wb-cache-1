Introduction Our aim is to compare two well known completions: the coequalizer completion C coeq of a small <b>category</b> <b>C</b> with finite sums (see [P]) and the exact completion of a small <b>category</b> <b>C</b> with weak finite limits (see [CV]). For a <b>category</b> <b>C</b> with finite sums and weak finite limits, C ex is always a full subcategory of C coeq. We characterize when the two completions are equivalent - {{it turns out that}} this corresponds to a finiteness condition expressed in terms of reflexive and symmetric graphs in C. 1. Two completions For a small <b>category</b> <b>C</b> with finite sums, the coequalizer completion of <b>C</b> is a <b>category</b> <b>C</b> coeq with finite colimits together with a finite sums preserving functor G C : C ! C coeq such that, for any finite sums preserving functor F : C !X into a finitely cocomplete category, there is a unique finite colimits preserving functor F : C [...] ...|$|R
