In 2013, however, {{researchers}} {{reported that the}} bees had used synthetics, including caulk, to seal the cells. [...] <b>Compositional</b> <b>analysis</b> of these materials revealed calcium, titanium, and iron. [...] They resembled polyurethane-based sealants typically used in building construction. [...] It {{is not uncommon for}} insects to live inside found objects made of plastic. [...] However, these findings are the first known of insects actually building nests with plastic. [...] With help from citizen scientists in Toronto, over 200 nest boxes were placed throughout the city. [...] Scanning electron microscopy, x-ray microanalysis, and infrared microscopy were employed in identification of polymeric specimens. [...] Researchers suggest the bees' behavior may be an example of adaptive behavior. Since some of the bees were free of parasites, these novel and possibly more robust methods of nest building may offer additional protection. [...] Incorporation of plastic into the walls and sealants of the cell nests appeared to provide some protection against brood parasite invasion. [...] However, use of these more readily available synthetic materials, in an urban setting, may be incidental. [...] In fact, exposure of brood to polyurethane and polyethylene based plastics could be detrimental, as the Canadian team noted, since diffusion of moisture could be inhibited. [...] Some of the brood specimens were heavily affected by mold growth. [...] Additionally, synthetic materials in the nest might hinder the bees ability to move and breath. [...] Toxin exposures and other effects of urbanization are well documented contributors towards pollinator decline in general.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Mandarin Chinese is {{characterized}} by being a tonal language; the pitch (or F 0) of its utterances carries considerable linguistic information.

40|$|Introduction One of {{the body}} fluids often used in {{metabolomics}} studies is urine. The concentrations of metabolites in urine are affected by hydration status of an individual, resulting in dilution differences. This requires therefore normalization of the data to correct for such differences. Two normalization techniques are commonly applied to urine samples prior to their further statistical analysis. First, AUC normalization aims to normalize a group of signals with peaks by standardizing the area under the curve (AUC) within a sample to the median, mean or any other proper representation {{of the amount of}} dilution. The second approach uses specific end-product metabolites such as creatinine and all intensities within a sample are expressed relative to the creatinine intensity. Objectives Another way of looking at urine metabolomics data is by realizing that the ratios between peak intensities are the information-carrying features. This opens up possibilities to use another class of data analysis techniques designed to deal with such ratios: <b>compositional</b> data <b>analysis.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop PARAFAC modeling of three-way urine metabolomics data in the context of <b>compositional</b> data <b>analysis</b> and compare this with standard normalization techniques. Methods In the <b>compositional</b> data <b>analysis</b> approach, special coordinate systems are defined to deal with the ratio problem. In essence, it comes down to using other distance measures than the Euclidian Distance that is used in the conventional analysis of metabolomic data. Results We illustrate using this type of approach in combination with three-way methods (i. e. PARAFAC) of a longitudinal urine metabolomics study and two simulations. In both cases, the advantage of the compositional approach is established in terms of improved interpretability of the scores and loadings of the PARAFAC model. Conclusion For urine metabolomics studies, we advocate the use of <b>compositional</b> data <b>analysis</b> approaches. They are easy to use, well established and proof to give reliable results...|$|R
