In this paper we show that strategies from hyperbolic nu-merics can lead to a significant quality gain in computational results.

Switching the roles of known and unknown with respect to image data and displacement field, we use the aris-ing hyperbolic <b>colour</b> <b>equation</b> as a basis for a refined nu-merical approach. For its discretisation, we propose to use one-sided differences in the correct direction identified via a smooth predictor solution. The one-sided differences that are first-order accurate are blended with higher-order central schemes. Thereby the blending mechanism interpolates be-tween the following two situations: The one-sided method is employed at image edges which often coincide with edges in the displacement field. In smooth image parts the higher-order scheme is used. We apply our new scheme to several prototypes of variational models for optic flow and stere...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} kiln drying of radiata pine with a primary focus on the change in wood colour that occurs during this process. The energy {{efficiency}} of the drying process has also been examined using computer modelling. The aim of this work was to develop guidelines for commercial wood dryers who wish to produce high quality appearance grade timber in a competitive commercial environment. The colour change in radiata pine wood during kiln drying is mainly caused by sap compounds accumulating at the wood surface and reacting to form coloured compounds. The initial research involved drying experiments designed to determine the relationship between this colour change and the kiln schedule and also measure the accumulation of colour forming compounds. The kinetics of the colour change reaction were also measured using two methods, one in-vitro and the other using small samples of wood. From these experiments a <b>colour</b> change <b>equation</b> was developed that predicts the rate of colour formation based on the drying conditions and this was incorporated into a kiln stack model along with an energy efficiency model. The combined model was used to simulate the drying process to find schedules optimised for energy use and wood quality. The model was also used to simulate the energy efficiency of different humidity control configurations for wood drying kilns. A kiln micro-sensor system was also developed for use in kiln diagnostics and control with the particular aim of identifying areas in wood drying kilns with adverse drying conditions. The recommendation to kiln operators wishing to reduce colour change is to not exceed 70 ? and to use lower relative humidity schedules with a wet bulb depression of 15 - 20 ?. Operating at lower humidity can increase the energy used by the kiln so it is also recommended that kiln designers incorporate heat recovery into the humidity control mechanisms of the kiln...|$|R

The extract was purified by washing with saturated NaHCO³ and KOH solutions. One half of the crude neutral fraction was fractionated with Girard's "T" reagent. The Zimmermann reaction was performed both in the ketonic and in the crude neutral extracts, using alcoholic 2. 5 N KOH and a 60 minutes period for the colour development in the dark. Optical density measuments were made in a grating Coleman Universal Spectrophotometer at 420 mµ and 520 mµ; for the crude neutral fraction a <b>colour</b> correction <b>equation</b> was applied. The aliquot fraction used for colorimety was adjusted for keeping optical density measurements within the range 0. 2 to 0. 7.

At the 0. 05 probability level there is a significant difference among castrated and normal group means (Fischer's "t" test.) when were used the data obtained from the ketonic fractions; in spite of the use of a colour correction applied for inespecific chromogens, the same results could not be obtained with the crude neutral fractions, Since Girard's reagent fractionation is generaly accepted as the best method for correcting the inespecific chromogen interference in the determination of the 17 -ketosteroids by the Zimmermann reaction, we emphasize the value of the results obtained with the ketonic fractions. From these results it appears, as occurs in others mammals, that castrated horses show a lower level of urinary 17 -ketosteroids excretion than the normal horses. The significance of the horse testis contribution for the neutral urinary steroid metabolites is discussed. Since horse urine has a low androgenic activity, the fractionation of the neutral 17 -ketosteroids must be studied more accurately...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Nearly all {{flat panel}} video display {{monitors}} have luminance and colour variations as {{the angle of}} view varies from the monitor’s perpendicular. The new MicrotileTM displays developed by Christie Digital are no exception to this general finding. A review of any book on colour science will {{show that there is}} substantial amount of literature on just noticeable colour differences within various colour spaces. Despite the wealth of data on the topic, there is no general consensus across different industries as to which colour space and <b>colour</b> difference <b>equations</b> are appropriate. Several factors like the background colour, object size, texture of the stimulus are different for different studies; these factors make it very difficult to determine precisely the effect of viewing angle on the perception of coloured images on the Microtiles display based on previous research. Hence, the objective of this thesis was to quantify the measured colour shifts of a Microtile display at different viewing angles, in steps of perceptible thresholds and to evaluate the acceptability of distortions at different viewing angles for complex scenes. Methods A preliminary experiment was setup to study the behaviour of Microtile display primaries as a function of viewing angle. The aim was to measure the shift in hue and luminance of the three primaries at different eccentricities (from 0 o to 40 o). The measured trend was used to simulate Microtile shifts on complex images for the rating task. 	In {{the first part of the}} perceptibility experiment, three reference colours were picked and 12 vectors heading towards the blue-yellow region of the L*a*b* colour space (pertaining to the colour shifts noticed with the Microtile displays). A uniform reference colour was presented in three of the four quadrants on the CRT monitor and one quadrant changed colour in the direction of the sampled vector. An adaptive, four alternate forced choice procedure was employed to determine thresholds for each of the 3 reference colours. The adaptive technique used was a ZEST paradigm. In the second part of the perceptibility experiment, eighteen directions were sampled around each reference colour. 	The rating task was based on simulating the measured attenuations of the Microtile primaries on complex scenes. Subjects rated the images both in terms of acceptability/unacceptability and as percentage image degradation. The simulation was presented on three static complex images, car, landscape and portrait. A total of 60 subjects participated in the study, 20 subjects for each experiment. All subjects were between the age group of 15 to 35 years of age and underwent battery of colour vision tests before being included in the study. All subjects included had average to superior colour discrimination as categorized using the FM- 100 Hue discrimination test. Results Study 1 : The preliminary study on Microtile display characteristics as a function of viewing angle showed that all the three primaries decreased in luminance with change in viewing angle. The red primary decreased at a faster rate compared to the other two primaries. The trend presents as a decrease in luminance with the hue shifting towards the blue-green region of the CIE 1974 L*a*b* space. 	Study 2 : Results from both the first and second parts of the perceptibility experiment showed that the vectors sampled in different directions approximated to ellipsoids in the L*a*b* colour space. This finding was consistent with the colour discrimination literature. Vectors on the equi-luminance plane were significantly longer than the vectors on the non equi-Luminance plane. Results showed that the average perceptibility thresholds in the non equi-luminance direction were lower than 1 ∆ELab¬¬¬¬. 	Study 3 : Results from the rating experiments showed that irrespective of the complexities in the images, distortions greater than five times thresholds were less than 50 % acceptable and were rated to be at least 30 % degraded. This corresponds to a viewing angle greater than 10 o for a Microtile display. The relationship between the stimulus (ΔE) and subjective Image degradation judgements followed a linear relationship, with the portrait and landscape having similar functions, whereas the car was rated more degraded at lower ΔEs and less degraded at higher ΔEs compared with the other two scenes. Conclusion Perceptibility thresholds for different reference colours showed that the conventionally used calibration precision of 1 ΔELab is a lenient criterion. Perceptibility thresholds are at least 25 % less for the Microtile display reference condition. From the results of the rating data a distortion greater than five times thresholds is less than 50 % acceptable and appears to be at least 30 % degraded for static complex images. However, the image quality judgments appear to be related to scene context, which requires further study...|$|R

H 577 P ITC 2015 Luoxxv, 211 leaves :color illustrations; 30 cmCommercial spectrophotometers {{and current}} {{state-of-the-art}} digital camera imaging systems {{are unable to}} measure the spectral reflectance of yarn dyed fabrics, the former can only measure the average reflectance of an area and the latter can only measure the tristimulus values derived from the camera's RGB responses. Multispectral imaging systems, on the other hand, {{have the potential to}} measure the reflectance of a multi-colour object, such as yarn dyed fabrics, since they can record both of the spectral and spatial information of a sample. In this thesis, colour measurement of yarn dyed fabrics based on the multispectral imaging technique is studied. The major factor restraining multispectral imaging systems from application in textile is the difficulty of correlation the measurement results of a yarn dyed fabric to the true colours of the yarns. The spectral response of multispectral imaging systems to yarn dyed fabrics is dramatically affected by irregular 3 D shapes of yarns, inter-reflection between neighbouring yarns, and interstices between weft and warp yarns. In this thesis, a novel reflection model is first proposed to estimate the interaction between light and a yarn dyed fabric surface. Surface texture, illumination occlusion and inter-reflection are taken into account. The reflection model is then verified by reducing the influence of texture on spectrophotometric colour. Derived from the proposed reflection model, reflectance and tristimulus values of yarn dyed fabrics with different texture structures are linear. The linear relationship in the reflectance space can be used to estimate a theoretical reflectance which discounts the influence of texture. Experimental results show that the impact of texture on colour for yarn dyed fabric samples in four colour centres and twenty-one texture structures can be reduced by 79 %, 55 %, 71 % and 57 %, respectively. Based on the proposed reflection model, multispectral imaging colour measurement of yarn dyed fabrics are achieved through a series of image processing techniques, namely, colour region segmentation, solid-colour and multi-colour region detection, and weft and warp yarn segmentation. Firstly, a yarn dyed fabric image is partitioned into dominant colour regions by a Gaussian model. The Gaussian model is used to reconstruct the CIELAB colour histograms of dominant colour regions from those of yarns. A hierarchical segmentation structure is then devised to obtain dominant colour regions by combining histogram segmentation results in three colour channels. Experimental results shows the proposed approach has excellent performance for dominant colour region segmentation with high computational efficiency. Secondly, a dominant colour region is detected as solid-colour or multi-colour by CIExyY histogram distributions. Derived from the proposed reflection model, the CIExyY histogram of a multi-colour yarn dyed fabric accords with a combination of two Gaussian distributions, whereas for that of a solid-colour yarn dyed fabric, it correlated to one Gaussian distribution. Experiments on real yarn dyed fabric samples demonstrate that solid-colour and multi-colour yarn dyed fabric regions can be distinguished in terms of CIExyY histogram distribution. Finally, a multi-colour yarn dyed fabric is segmented to weft and warp yarns by a modified K-means clustering method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can segment weft and warp yarns in yarn dyed fabric images, with both high segmentation accuracy and fast processing speed. In addition, the proposed reflection model can be utilized to accomplish multispectral imaging colour measurement of single yarns. Single yarns are the elemental weaving components of yarn dyed fabrics and have much simpler structures. The multispectral imaging colour of a single yarn is not affected by surface texture and inter-reflection. The colour measurement of single yarns is achieved by two steps. Firstly, a single yarn is segmented from backgrounds by an image difference method. Secondly, the reflectance of a single yarn can be specified by different weighting methods. Experimental results show that multispectral imaging colour measurement of single yarns can achieve a repeatability of 0. 1185 CMC(2 : 1) units and a spatial reproducibility of 0. 2827 CMC(2 : 1) units. Experimental results also show that single yarns measured by multispectral imaging systems can accomplish the similar colour matching results as solid-colour yarn dyed fabrics measured by spectrophotometers. Finally, an optical-based approach is proposed to explore the relation between the multispectral imaging colour of a single yarn and the spectrophotometric colour of the corresponding yarn card. A <b>colour</b> mapping <b>equation</b> between the single yarn and corresponding yarn card can be then found by the simplex optimal method. Experimental results show that colour difference between single yarns and corresponding yarn cards reduces from 2. 97 to 1. 20 CMC(2 : 1) units for 50 pairs of training samples and from 3. 09 to 1. 37 CMC(2 : 1) units for 50 pairs of testing samples.

40|$|The {{quality of}} fruit and {{vegetables}} {{is very important to}} producers, retailers and consumers. The consumer decides, based on the observed quality of the product, whether or not to buy the product. Next to the flavour and the texture of the fruit, also the appearance is a critical quality parameter. Nowadays, inspection of this appearance is achieved through visual inspection, although it is subjective, not very precise and prone to human errors. Therefore, an automation of this quality inspection would be beneficial. A promising technique for this automation is hyperspectral imaging, enabling the measurement of spectral information in all the pixels in an image. Although many researchers have demonstrated the added value of hyperspectral imaging for quality inspection of agrofood products, this technology was still rarely used in the agrofood industry at the start of this PhD research. One of the reasons was the acquisition time of spectral hypercubes which was typically high. However, this acquisition speed is considerably improved by companies like IMEC, that recently developed hyperspectral cameras with a high acquisition speed. The main reason was the large added v needed to build calibration models and the limited added value to justify the price. Therefore, in this PhD research, the focus was on improving the flexibility of hyperspectral imaging and, as the colour and colour distribution of fruit or vegetables is an important parameter to determine its quality and ripeness, on the development of a method to determine the colour of tomatoes in every pixel. In this way, a fast and contact-free method could be obtained. These concepts were elaborated for vine tomatoes, which were used as a model case containing different challenges, as they have a curved and very glossy surface and vine tomatoes consist of different components, which can vary in quality considerably. First, a semi-supervised algorithm was developed to segment hyperspectral images. It consists of three steps. First, several unsupervised algorithms are tested to split a spectral hypercube in a predefined number of comparable classes. By an operator, based on a visual inspection of the segmentation, the best split is determined. Based on this selection, from each class, a number of pixels is selected using a selection algorithm, which are used as input to develop a supervised segmentation model. This supervised model is used to segment newly measured spectral hypercubes of the same cultivar. Spectra of badly segmented spectral hypercubes are then used to augment the training set and to obtain a more robust model. After training with 10 new spectral hypercubes, the best result was achieved using a Partial Least Squares – Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), using a first derivative preprocessing. Applied on 5 additional spectral hypercubes, an overall accuracy on pixel level of 96. 95 % for vine tomatoes and 98. 52 % for table grapes was achieved. After the initial segmentation of spectral hypercubes in its present classes, the quality {{of fruit and}} vegetables can be determined. Another important quality parameter of vine tomatoes is the ripeness. Ripeness of tomatoes is linked to the colour, as during ripening the concentration of chlorophyll decreases while the concentration of lycopene increases, which results in a colour change from green to red. To measure the average colour and the variability present in each tomato, the colour of each pixel in the segmented tomatoes was determined. Therefore, two different methods are compared. The first method is by using the calculations developed by CIE to determine the L*a*b*-values. This method was suited for flat, matte samples, {{but in the case of}} vine tomatoes, which are curved and very glossy, the results were not accurate. Therefore, a databased method is presented. This method was suited to determine the hue-angle (R² = 0. 95), the a*-value (R² = 0. 93) and the L*-value (R² = 0. 86) accurately. However, the disadvantage of this method is that it can only be used to determine the colour of comparable tomatoes. Next, it was investigated if the colour of a batch of tomatoes during storage could be predicted based on a measurement shortly after harvest. First, a model was built to describe the variability of a batch of tomatoes during storage. Therefore, mixed effects modelling was used. To describe the colour evolution accurately, 2 random effects were needed. As an analytical solution in this case is very difficult, a data-driven approach was developed. By using the algorithm to determine the hue of tomatoes, the hue in every pixel of the tomato in the image could be accurately determined. Next, a distribution was fitted over all the results of each tomato. The mean and skewness of this distribution was determined and used, together with the time after harvest and the time at which the colour should be known, as input in a multiple linear regression. This made it possible to predict the hue of tomatoes at a certain moment in the near future, until 10 days after harvest, with an R² of more than 0. 80 and a RMSE of less than 9 °. High quality products need to be free of defects. As a large variability in surface defects can occur, training a method to detect all possible defects is very difficult. Therefore, an algorithm was developed to detect defects on tomatoes by training a model to know good quality tomatoes. Defects are detected as outlying from this good quality. Resulting from an analysis of the spectra of the different tomatoes, the wavelength range between 700 nm and 985 nm was selected and an area-normalization was used as preprocessing. Then, the preprocessed spectra of each individual tomato was used as input of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), so defective areas could be detected based on a combination of Hotelling’s T²-values and Q-residuals, evaluated by comparing a local difference against a threshold value. After optimisation of this threshold, the algorithm is able to detect puncture damage, but the detection of bruises and cutting damage is more difficult. It could be observed that specular reflections had a large influence on the detection result. By using a cross-polarized hyperspectral setup, it was possible to reduce this effect, reducing the numbers of false-positive detections. The algorithms described above are an important step towards a more easy, intuitive application of hyperspectral imaging. To improve the results achieved by the defect detection algorithm, the initial segmentation should be optimised. It is important that the number of misclassifications resulting from the semi-supervised segmentation algorithm is as low as possible, as these are an important source of misclassifications during the defect detection. Next, methods which are able to account for the curvature of the products and the presence of specular reflections should be developed, as they lead to low accuracies achieved when measuring the <b>colour</b> using the <b>equations</b> described by CIE. A possible solution that should be investigated, is the application of the cross-polarised illumination to reduce the effect of specular reflections on the colour calculations. To ensure that the developed algorithms are robust, they should also be tested on different products, like grapes or cranberries. nrpages: 126 status: publishe...|$|R
