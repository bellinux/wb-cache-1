The study used both qualitative and quantitative approaches to a population of NSSF with sample size of 104 respondents. Questionnaires and Interviews, have been used as data collection tools, data analysis was done through a special programme known as SPSS. Findings revealed that the major aim of social security funds is to help members to live a better life while he/she is working and after retirement. Social Security Funds can be threatened by members’ loss of jobs as these social funds depend much on members’ contribution to fulfill their operations, when members lose their jobs automatically the contribution <b>collection</b> <b>performance</b> of NSSF must drop. Closure of businesses in the country leads NSSF members to lose jobs. It is recommended that the board and other stakeholders should ensure better management of the pension funds so that adequate returns are obtained on the monies received and invested by the fund.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand of air filters with a high <b>collection</b> <b>performance,</b> i. e., high collection efficiency and low pressure drop, for the application to indoor air cleaning. Air filters consisting of nanofibers have attracted great interests since {{they may have a}} low pressure drop because of slip flow effect and high collection efficiency due to interception. Although various nanofiber filters are available on the market, their <b>collection</b> <b>performance</b> is not as high as expected by the conventional filtration theory because non-uniform packing of fibers plays a significant role. In the present work, the <b>collection</b> <b>performance</b> of nanofiber (780 nm) and microfiber (11. 2 µm) mixed filters with various mixing fractions was studied in order to maximize the quality factor of filter, qF, as a function of mixing fraction of nanofibers. The <b>collection</b> <b>performance</b> of mixed fiber filters was predicted by using theoretical equations reported by Bao et al. (1998) for bimodal distribution of fibers. As a result, {{it was found that the}} mixed fiber filters had a uniform fiber packing compared to laminated filters and that the collection efficiency was well predicted by introducing the inhomogeneity factor calculated for the filter consisting of two distinct fiber sizes. Furthermore, we found that the mixed fiber filter with the nanofiber mixing fraction of 5 % in mass had the highest quality factor. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research...|$|E

However, as the numbers of threads and processing cores are scaled up, many applications do not achieve the desired level of performance improvement. In this paper, we explore two factors, lock contention and garbage <b>collection</b> <b>performance</b> that can affect scalability of Java applications. Our initial result reveals two new observations. First, applications that are highly scalable may experience more instances of lock contention than those experienced by applications that are less scalable.

40|$|Researchers {{have devoted}} decades towards {{improving}} garbage <b>collection</b> <b>performance.</b> A key question is: what opportunity remains for performance improvement? Because the perceived performance disadvantage of garbage collection {{is often cited}} {{as a barrier to}} its adoption, we propose using explicit memory management as the touchstone for evaluating garbage <b>collection</b> <b>performance.</b> ^ Unfortunately, programmers using garbage-collected languages do not specify when to deallocate memory, precluding a direct comparison with explicit memory management. We observe that we can simulate the effect of explicit memory management by profiling applications and generating object reachability information and lifetimes to serve as zero-cost oracles to guide explicit memory reclamation. We call this approach oracular memory management. However, existing methods of generating exact object reachability are prohibitively expensive. We first present the object reachability time algorithm, which we call Merlin. We show how Merlin runs in time proportional to the running time of the application and can be performed either on-line or off-line. We then present empirical results showing that Merlin requires orders of magnitude less time than brute force trace generation. ^ We next present simulation results from experiments with the oracular memory manager. These results show that when memory is plentiful, garbage <b>collection</b> <b>performance</b> is competitive with explicit memory management, occasionally increasing program throughput by 10...|$|E
40|$|Even minimal {{improvements}} in particle collection efficiency of electrostatic precipitators significantly reduce dust emission from fossil-fuelled power stations and reduce pollution. Yet current designs {{rely on the}} Deutsch collection theory, which was developed for tubular precipitators and {{has been applied to}} wire-plate precipitators {{on the assumption that the}} inter-electrode electric fields at the same discharge distance in both were similar. Differences in geometry and associated collector electric fields and current density non-uniformity have not been taken into account, although the collector electric field and current density of the wire-plate precipitator are not uniform. And observations show that precipitated dust patterns and the distribution of collector current density are interrelated. Investigations revealed a simple square law relationship between the collector electric field and the collector current density in the space charge dominated coronas. Applying this relationship to the Deutsch collection theory led to a current-density-based collection formula that takes into account the non-uniform collector current density distribution. The current-density-based collection formula is then used to assess the impact of collector current density on collection efficiency, the results closely following published measurements. Applying the current-density-based collection formula to estimate the dust accumulation shows that most of the dust accumulates at collector locations facing the corona wires. The effect of the non-uniform precipitated dust layer on <b>collection</b> <b>performance</b> is assessed using the distributed corona impedance - the ratio of the inter-electrode voltage and the non-uniform collector current. Re-distribution of the collector current profile as dust builds up is also compatible with published measurements. Finally this is applied to optimize the wire-plate precipitator <b>collection</b> <b>performance.</b> This shows that optimal <b>collection</b> <b>performance</b> is obtained with the wire-wire spacing less than the wire-plate distance, once again confirming published experimental results. This is the first analytical approach to show better <b>collection</b> <b>performance</b> can be achieved at the ratio of wire-wire spacing/wire-plate distance not equal to unity, which has been the standard industry practice since 1960...|$|E

The previous identified slot scan-based tag collection algorithm is optimized in situations where all the tags store the fixed size of data, so it could not result in a good performance improvement with tags having the variable size of data. The improved tag collection algorithm proposed in this paper first collects the slot size information required for the data transmission from each tag via the identified slot scan phase, and then performs the tag collection phase using the information, which resolves {{the problem of the}} previous identified slot scan-based tag collection algorithm.

40|$|Performance {{measurement}} {{has gained}} significant importance around the world. Many governments are adopting performance measurement {{as a part}} of reform efforts. Despite the widespread practitioner attention, academic studies are inconclusive about the impact of performance measurement in the public sector. Moreover, while studies have examined what factors influence the adoption of performance measures and its impact, they have paid relatively less attention to the use of different types of performance measures. To fill this gap, this study examines: (1) what types of performance measures are collected by US local governments and; (2) how organizational, technical, and external factors influence the <b>collection</b> of <b>performance</b> measurement. Leveraging survey data, we conduct cluster analysis and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to study factors that impact the <b>collection</b> of <b>performance</b> measures.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedCurrently, Naval Security Group (NSG) personnel lack an automated system for evaluating Signals-of-Interest (SOI) <b>collection</b> <b>performance</b> of NSG sites. The performance evaluation technique (PET), developed by {{faculty and students}} of the Naval Postgraduate School, is intended to meet this need. A means for automating the PET has been developed under this thesis research. This "MATLAB Automated PET System" (MAPS) is described in this thesis and compared with the previous manual PET and a semi-automated version based on GRAFTOOL software. MAPS, based on the high-level language, MATLAB, utilizes measured signal and noise levels and system gains and losses to evaluate site performance in terms of percent of SOI lost. This information is critical to managers and operators of the various NSG collection sites located throughout the world. It permits managers to assess operator performance, evaluate the impact of encroachments {{in the vicinity of}} the site, determine the utility of proposed interference mitigation actions, recognize the effect of natural phenomena (such as solar storms) on the SOI collection capability, and predict future SOI <b>collection</b> <b>performance.</b> The manual, semi-automated, and automated PET systems were compared in the areas of cost, speed, ease-of-operation, and accuracy of the performance estimation.
