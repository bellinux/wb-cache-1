40|$|To {{determine}} {{the safety and}} complications of chest <b>tube</b> <b>clamping,</b> a retrospective chart review was conducted at Baylor University Medical Center's level I trauma center. The records of 243 patients with pneumothoraces, hemothoraces, or a combination were identified and analyzed; 134 patients underwent clamping according to the care path, and 109 did not. The demographic characteristics of age, gender, and mechanism of injury were similar in both groups, as was the frequency of pneumothoraces, hemothoraces, and combined hemo/pneumothoraces. Subsequent radiographs showing recurrence or patient symptoms were noted in 13 patients (9. 7 %), requiring unclamping. Nine patients (6. 7 %) who had passed the clamping trial prior to removal required reinsertion of a chest tube due to recurrent pneumothoraces. One clamped patient required urgent insertion of a second thoracostomy tube due to occlusive thrombus within the residing chest tube. No deaths were documented {{as a result of}} the care path or of clamping. Overall, the <b>clamped</b> chest <b>tube</b> allows for more definitive assessment of persistent occult air leaks based on a 6 -hour chest radiograph and avoidance of premature removal and did not appear to have any adverse effects on patient safety. Further refinements of the clamping procedure may be needed, as some patients still required reinsertion despite an absence of pneumothorax after a 6 -hour clamping trial. Given these data, a prospective study with clamping is warranted to evaluate whether or not such a system can increase the speed with which chest tubes are removed and decrease the length of stay while maintaining patient safety...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMany {{thin-walled}} cylindrical shells {{are used}} in structural applications in which the dominant loading condition is global bending. Key examples include chimneys, wind turbine support towers, pipelines, horizontal tanks, tubular piles and silos. The buckling behaviour of these structures in bending is complex due to the coupling between cross-section ovalisation and local bifurcation buckling. Analytical treatments of this problem have a history going back almost a century and still constitute an active and challenging research area. This paper investigates in detail the effect of cylinder length on the nonlinear elastic buckling behaviour of <b>clamped</b> cylindrical <b>tubes</b> under global bending, covering a very wide range of lengths.

40|$|Introduction: In some cases, {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax may require surgery, but in poor risk patients, pleurodesis {{may be a}} reasonable choice. Pleurodedis with autologous blood necessitates the clampage of the chest tube for a period. Excess air leakage from the chest tube may avoid the clampage. A simple technique without <b>clamping</b> the chest <b>tube</b> during pleurodesis is described which we used in patients with persistent air leak. Material and Method: The study comprised 11 patients diagnosed with {{spontaneous pneumothorax}} who were treated by autologous blood patch pleurodesis without <b>clamping</b> the chest <b>tube.</b> Pleurodesis was performed at the bedside by giving 50 ml autologous blood into the pleural cavity. The tube was lifted up to form a loop, {{in order to prevent}} the blood from draining into the bottle. Cessation of air leak at the end of 72 hours was accepted as complete response, whereas a marked decrease in air leakage was accepted as partial response to the procedure. Results: The mean age and age range of 10 male and 1 female patients were 55. 6 + 15. 7 and 29 - 75, consecutively. Complete response was obtained in 6 patients (% 54. 5), partial in 4 (% 36. 4). Air drainage continued without any change in 1 patient. Complications were empyema (1 patient) and intrathoracic coagulum (1 patient). Conclusion: The aforementioned loop technique facilitates the execution of autologous blood patch pleurodesis, particularly in patients with an excessive air leak. In our opinion, it is a reliable technique both for preventing air leakage and achieving pleurodesis in selective patients unsuitable for surgery...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} an esophageal doppler device to non-invasively detect experimental pseudo-electromechanical dissociation (pseudo-EMD). DESIGN Prospective, controlled, laboratory investigation using an asphyxial canine cardiac arrest model and a newly-developed esophageal flat-flow probe doppler unit. INTERVENTIONS Mongrel dogs (20) were instrumented for hemodynamic monitoring. The esophageal doppler probe {{was placed in the}} distal esophagus of each animal. Electromechanical dissociation (EMD) was induced by <b>clamping</b> the endotracheal <b>tube.</b> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A period of pseudo-EMD was defined as the time where cardiac contractility was present, measured by a micromanometer tipped thoracic aortic catheter, without concurrent femoral pulses by palpation. The pseudo-EMD period could be produced consistently in all 20 animals. The characteristic doppler flow sounds were easily heard using the esophageal device in all animals. The time from endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>clamping</b> until loss of femoral pulses was 622 +/- 96 s; until loss of radial artery doppler signals was 616 +/- 92 s; until loss of esophageal doppler signals was 728 +/- 88 s; and until loss of aortic fluctuations by thoracic aortic catheter was 728 +/- 82 s. The times to loss of esophageal doppler sounds and loss of aortic fluctuations were not significantly different. However, they were significantly longer than the time to loss of femoral pulses (P < 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS The canine asphyxial EMD model can be used for short experimental studies of pseudo-EMD. Pseudo-EMD can be consistently and non-invasively detected with this esophageal doppler device. The device is as reliable as a micromanometer tipped aortic arch catheter in detecting pseudo-EMD. The doppler device could potentially be useful in improving recognition of near cardiac arrest in pre-hospital and emergency department settings.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Veno-arterial extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (V-A ECMO) is a life-saving {{procedure in}} patients with both respiratory and cardiac failure. Bleeding complications are common since patients must be maintained on anticoagulation. Massive hemoptysis is a rare complication of ECMO; however, it may result in death if not managed thoughtfully and expeditiously.

The management of and the outcomes in these patients were studied. Massive hemoptysis was defined as an inability to control bleeding (3 ̆e 300 mL/day) from the endotracheal tube with conventional maneuvers, such as bronchoscopy with cold saline lavage, diluted epinephrine lavage and selective lung isolation. All of these episodes necessitated disconnecting the ventilator tubing and <b>clamping</b> the endotracheal <b>tube,</b> causing full airway tamponade.
