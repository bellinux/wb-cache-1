Adjacent to this large <b>cargo</b> <b>door</b> is an exit door {{used by the}} pilots. All other emergency exits are omitted, and cabin windows and passenger amenities are not available. The main deck cargo hold has a smooth fiberglass lining, and a fixed rigid barrier with a sliding access door serves as a restraint wall next to the flight deck. Both lower holds can be equipped with a telescoping baggage system to load custom-fitted cargo modules. When equipped for extended-range transatlantic operations, UPS's 757-200PFs feature an upgraded auxiliary power unit, additional cargo bay fire suppression equipment, enhanced avionics, and an optional supplemental fuel tank in the aft lower hold. Total production for the 757-200PF totaled 80 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, All Nippon Airways took {{delivery}} of the first 767-300BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter), a modified passenger-to-freighter model. The conversion work was performed in Singapore by ST Aerospace Services, the first supplier to offer a 767-300BCF program, and involved {{the addition of a}} main deck <b>cargo</b> <b>door,</b> strengthened main deck floor, and additional freight monitoring and safety equipment. Since then, Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, and Wagner Aeronautical have also offered passenger-to-freighter conversion programs for 767-300 series aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The 757-200M, a {{convertible}} version {{capable of carrying}} cargo and passengers on its main deck, entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in 1988. Also known as the 757-200 Combi, the type retains the passenger windows and cabin doors of the 757-200, while adding a forward port-side <b>cargo</b> <b>door</b> {{in the manner of}} the 757-200PF. Kathmandu-based Royal Nepal Airlines, later renamed Nepal Airlines, included the convertible model as part of an order for two 757s in 1986.|$|E
5|$|The 767-200 ceased {{production}} in the late 1980s, superseded by the extended-range 767-200ER. Some early 767-200s were subsequently upgraded to extended-range specification. In 1998, Boeing began offering 767-200 conversions to 767-200SF (Special Freighter) specification for cargo use, and Israel Aerospace Industries has been licensed to perform cargo conversions since 2005. The conversion process entails the installation of a side <b>cargo</b> <b>door,</b> strengthened main deck floor, and added freight monitoring and safety equipment. The 767-200SF was positioned {{as a replacement for}} Douglas DC-8 freighters.|$|E
5|$|Royal New Zealand Air Force 757 Combi – the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) {{operates}} two 757s {{converted to}} 757-200M standard by ST Aerospace Services for delivering equipment, medical evacuation, troop movements, and VIP transport. A <b>cargo</b> <b>door,</b> upgraded auxiliary power unit, enhanced communications systems, and retractable airstairs are fitted. The two aircraft, which replaced two 727-100QCs, have carried the Prime Minister of New Zealand, {{as well as}} flown to the ice-covered Pegasus Field near New Zealand's Scott Base in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with the}} {{delivery}} of the F-28s and 737s, all planes were named after Norwegian kings. The last three F-27s were also given such names. During the 1970s, Braathens SAFE took delivery of eleven 737s, supplementing the four F-28s. The third delivered, LN-SUA, had a <b>cargo</b> <b>door</b> on the side, making it ideal for cargo flights. The three planes delivered in 1979 had extended range tanks making direct flights to the Canary Islands possible. In 1979, the company started looking into possible replacements for their fleet, considering larger aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The combi model, the 747-200M, {{could carry}} freight {{in the rear}} section of the main deck via a side <b>cargo</b> <b>door.</b> A {{removable}} partition on the main deck separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front. The -200M could carry up to 238 passengers in a three-class configuration with cargo carried on the main deck. The model was {{also known as the}} 747-200 Combi. As on the -100, a stretched upper deck (SUD) modification was later offered. A total of 10 converted 747-200s were operated by KLM. Union des Transports Aériens (UTA) also had two aircraft converted.|$|E
5|$|The 757-200SF, a {{conversion}} of passenger 757-200s for cargo use, entered service with DHL Aviation in 2001. Modifications by Boeing Wichita in Kansas included {{the removal of}} passenger amenities, main deck structural reinforcement, and the installation of a 757-200PF forward fuselage section with a port-side <b>cargo</b> <b>door.</b> The forward two entry doors are retained, resulting in a main deck cargo capacity of 14 pallets, which is one less than the 757-200PF. Environmental controls can be fitted for animal cargo, and rear exits and window pairs are retained on some aircraft. Besides Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, Precision Conversions, and ST Aerospace Services have also handled 757-200SF conversions. In September 2006, FedEx Express announced a US$2.6billion plan to acquire over 80 converted 757 freighters to replace its 727 fleet.|$|E
