40|$|June 1, 2016 Gustav Papanek {{was born}} 1926 in Vienna, Austria, {{where he lived}} with his parents and with his younger brother in Antaeusgasse 41 in Hietzing, the 13 th {{district}} of Vienna. Gustav's mother was a physician in her father's private hospital, the Fango Heilanstalt, on Lazarettgasse 20. Gustav's father Ernst {{was a member of the}} Vienna city council and a functionary in Austria’s socialist party, leading the "Sozialistische Arbeiterjugend". Gustav attended school at Maroltingergasse. He grew up without any creed and became interested in socialist ideologies at a very young age. In February 1934 during the Austrian civil war, his father, like other socialists in high position, had to leave Austria and moved to Czechoslovakia. Gustav continued to live with his mother and his brother in Vienna, seeing his father only during vacations and being spied on by members of the Christian Social party. After March 1938, Gustav Papanek, being declared Jewish according to the Nuremberg Laws, was transferred to the school in Wasagasse. His father obtained visas for France through his close connection to the French prime minister Leon Blum. The family left Austria by train in May 1938 and settled in a suburb of Paris. In the first year, Gustav and his brother attended the private American McJanett school before switching to a French public school. His mother worked as a children’s doctor, and his father took on a job, running children's homes in the same suburb. During his time in Paris, Gustav Papanek joined the Austrian Socialist Youth Group. With the occupation of France, the family moved to Marseille to obtain so-called emergency rescue visas <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States. The family then went via Spain to Lisbon, where they took the Greek ship "Nea Hellas" to New York. The Papaneks arrived in New York in August 1940 and moved to the Upper West Side. Gustav Papanek passed the region's exams at the age of 15 and eventually started working as a farm laborer in upstate New York. He then attended Cornell University for agriculture, before joining the army at the age of 18. He was part of the de-Nazification team in Munich, mainly identifying Nazis on NS photographs. He graduated in 1947 and earned his Ph. D. at Harvard with the assistance of the G. I. Bill. Gustav Papanek became <b>the</b> American <b>chief</b> <b>economist</b> <b>for</b> Asia at <b>the</b> age of 26. His department was abolished under the McCarthy Era.
