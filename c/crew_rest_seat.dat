5|$|In 2003, Boeing {{introduced}} overhead <b>crew</b> <b>rests</b> as {{an option}} on the 777. Located above the main cabin and connected via staircases, the forward flight <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> contains two <b>seats</b> and two bunks, while the aft cabin <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> features multiple bunks. The Signature Interior has since been adapted for other Boeing wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, including 737NG, 747-400, 757-300, and newer 767 models, including all 767-400ER models. The 747-8 and 767-400ER have also adopted the larger, more rounded windows of the original 777.|$|R
5000|$|Available seat miles (ASM) or Available seat {{kilometres}} (ASK) [...] is {{a measure}} of an airline flight's passenger carrying capacity. It is equal to the number of seats available multiplied by the number of miles or kilometres flown. An available seat mile is the fundamental unit of production for a passenger-carrying airline. A unit in this case is one seat, available for sale, flown one mile. For example, an aircraft with 300 seats available for sale flying 1,000 statute miles would generate 300,000 ASMs for that particular flight. That the seats are available for sale is critical. An aircraft that had 300 seats but which was limited (for regulatory or technical reasons) to selling only 250 of them on a particular flight of 1,000 miles would generate 250,000 ASMs on that flight, not 300,000. Similarly, if passenger seats on a particular flight are dedicated to <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> purposes, such <b>seats</b> would not be included in the calculation of ASMs for that flight.|$|R

5000|$|The Federal Aviation Administration defines {{three classes}} of <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> facilities, the types {{required}} to be available depend {{on the number of}} crew and the duration of the flight.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to examine tooth {{preparations}} made by general dental practitioners (GDPs) for occlusal and cingulum <b>rest</b> <b>seats</b> for cobalt-chromium removable partial dentures (RPDs). Master casts and prescribed denture designs for cobalt-chromium RPDs produced by a commercial dental laboratory from impressions made by 45 GDPs across Wales were evaluated {{over a period of}} 5 months. Rest seats and associated interocclusal clearances were assessed using pre-determined criteria. A total of 68 casts were examined. Of these, 33 did not have <b>rest</b> <b>seats</b> included in their prescription. Of the remaining 35 casts, 81 rests had been prescribed of which only 24 (30 %) had signs of tooth preparations for these <b>rest</b> <b>seats.</b> Using pre-determined criteria, 60 % of <b>rest</b> <b>seats</b> were under-prepared in the mesio-distal plane and 30 % were over-prepared in the bucco-lingual plane. In 17 cases where natural teeth opposed the <b>rest</b> <b>seat,</b> the mean interocclusal clearance was 1. 5 mm (range 0. 6 - 3. 5 mm) with 6 of the 17 rests (35 %) being less than the recommended thickness. In total, 18 of the 24 rests prepared did not meet the criteria, and 11 of the 21 rests prescribed had no obvious preparation and insufficient occlusal clearance. Where prescribed, the majority of rests did not meet the identified criteria. The <b>rest</b> <b>seat</b> preparations varied greatly in all planes including the interocclusal clearance. Further emphasis should be given to aspects of denture design in undergraduate and continuing education programmes for dentists...|$|R

40|$|Magister Chirurgiae Dentium - MChDA well {{designed}} metal-based removable partial denture (MBRPD) is a cost-effective and a conservative method of rehabilitating a partially edentulous mouth. The MBRPD {{demands that the}} abbutment tooth provides support and/or retention while the abutment tooth, in turn, expects the MBRPD to transmit the forces axially and to be passive when fully seated. For vertical forces to be transmitted axially, occlusal <b>rest</b> <b>seats</b> {{have to be prepared}} on the abutment teeth to receive a cast metal rest of the MBRPD. The  objective {{of this study was to}} compare occlusal <b>rest</b> <b>seat</b> preparations for metal-based removable partial dentures (MBPRD) prepared by dental students at the UWC Oral Health centres, to the corresponding cast metal rests and to determine action taken in response to discovered discrepancies between the <b>rest</b> <b>seat</b> preparation depth and the cast metal occlusal rset thickness.

40|$|PURPOSE: Adequate {{preparation}} of abutment teeth for removable partial denture (RPD) <b>rest</b> <b>seats</b> allows appropriate masticatory force transmission, retention, {{and stability of}} supporting structures. It follows that careful preparation will be important for the longevity of the rehabilitation. The present study aimed to clinically evaluate <b>rest</b> <b>seats</b> and undercut areas of abutment teeth in RPD wearers after 2 years of use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 193 occlusal, incisal, and cingulum <b>rest</b> <b>seats</b> were evaluated in terms of shape, rest adaptation, wear, caries, fractures, and surface type (enamel, composite resin, or amalgam). Two hundred and fourteen undercut areas were evaluated in terms of surface type (enamel or restoration) and integrity. This study {{was approved by the}} Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, resolution 196 / 1996, protocol number 11 / 05. RESULTS: Intact preparations accounted for 92. 2 % of the total. Application of the Pearson test (p= 0. 289) found no statistically significant differences among the materials on which the <b>rest</b> <b>seats</b> were prepared. For the undercut areas, 20. 7 % of those obtained on restorative material were nonintact. In addition, Fisher's exact test showed a statistically significant difference (p= 0. 001) in surface type; enamel surfaces were shown to be 14 times more stable than restored surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The {{results of this study suggest}} that <b>rest</b> <b>seats</b> are stable, regardless of the material on which they are prepared. Retentive areas were shown to be more stable when they were located in enamel...|$|R

In this configuration, the central aisle in business and economy classes is quite narrow. A first class compartment is optionally sited aft of forward entry door or just forward of midships entry door, with an economy compartment further forward in the latter case.
