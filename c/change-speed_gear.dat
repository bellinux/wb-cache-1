5000|$|The {{main clutch}} is multiple-disc type with metal to metal {{friction}} surfaces running in oil. The <b>change-speed</b> <b>gear</b> is designed on [...] "Mercedes" [...] lines using ball-bearings {{and it provides}} four forward speeds. Each shaft has three bearings. The sliding portion of the mechanism is enclosed. There is no joint that can leak.|$|E

50|$|All cyclecars {{were to have}} {{clutches}} and <b>change-speed</b> <b>gears.</b> This requirement {{could be}} fulfilled by even the simplest devices such as provision for slipping the belt on the pulley {{to act as a}} clutch, and varying of the pulley diameter to change the gear ratio.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} now {{supported}} at just three not four points using special rubber insulation to control noise and vibration. Rover's—as it was promoted— Easy-free gear change {{was a new}} 4-speed gearbox with constant mesh double-helical gears for 2nd and 3rd and a freewheel device with its control beside the driver. A further convenience was an optional extra power-controlled or automatic clutch. A Startix automatic engine starter was fitted. Startix was activated when the ignition was switched on and, in addition, operated automatically if the engine stalled. The new <b>change-speed</b> system meant <b>gears</b> might be changed after a slight easing of the accelerator without using the clutch yet making no noise. A knob on the instrument panel switched of the freewheel and returned the gearbox to orthodox. The half-elliptic spring on both axles are controlled by hydraulic shock-absorbers. The freewheel was to remain a feature of Rovers for more than 20 years.|$|R
