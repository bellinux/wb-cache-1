40|$|The <b>city</b> <b>manager’s</b> role in {{policy-making}} {{has long}} been recognized in the public administration literature. However, it remains unclear why <b>city</b> <b>managers</b> participate in policy-making at differ-ent levels.

The present study considers multiple dimensions of political leadership and advances a more comprehensive theoretical framework. It then undertakes an empirical examination, using survey data collected from <b>city</b> <b>managers</b> in Georgia. The results uncover more complicated configurations of political dynamics in local government than described by either the substitution or the collaboration model...|$|R
