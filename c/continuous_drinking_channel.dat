40|$|Guaranteeing a {{safe and}} <b>continuous</b> <b>drinking</b> water supply {{for the city of}} Cali, Colombia, has become a concern for the water company of Cali, the {{environmental}} authorities, universities, and entities involved in the water resource. The progressive deterioration of the city’s water sources has led to a search for future water sources and/or technologies in order to ensure high water quality standards at minimal costs. This paper describes a variety of problems occurring in the current water supply system in Cali and gives a description of the alternatives that have been considered to solve these problems in the past decades. Multi-criteria analysis was applied to assess alternatives for safe drinking supplies, demonstrating their suitability during the decision-making process when constraints arise due to political, community and institutional interests. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The Temptation and Restraint Inventory (TRI) is {{commonly}} used to measure drinking restraint in relation to problem drinking behavior. However, as yet the TRI has not been validated in a clinical group with alcohol dependence. Method: Male (n = 111) and female (n = 57) inpatients with DSM-IV diagnosed alcohol dependence completed the TRI and measures of problem drinking severity, including the Alcohol Dependence Scale and the quantity, frequency and week total of alcohol consumed. Results: The {{factor structure of the}} TRI was replicated in the alcohol dependent sample. Cognitive Emotional Preoccupation (CEP), one of the two higher order factors of the TRI, demonstrated sound predictive power toward all dependence severity indices. The other higher order factor, Cognitive Behavioral Control (CBC), was related to frequency of drinking. There was limited support for the CEP/CBC interactional model of drinking restraint. Conclusions: Although the construct validity of the TRI was sound, the measure appears more useful in understanding the development, maintenance and severity of alcohol-related problems in nondependent drinkers. The TRI may show promise in detecting either <b>continuous</b> <b>drinking</b> or heavy episodic type dependent drinkers...|$|R

Information on arsenic poisoning of {{the primary source of}} drinking water-tube wells-is used to ascertain arsenic exposure. The findings show an unambiguously negative and statistically significant correlation between mathematics score and arsenicosis at home, net of exposure at school. Split-sample analysis reveals that the effect is only specific to boys; for girls, the effect is negative but insignificant. Similar correlations are found for cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes such as subjective well-being, that is, a self-reported measure of life satisfaction (also a direct proxy for health status) of students and their performance in primary-standard mathematics. These correlations remain robust to controlling for school-level exposure.

40|$|Abstract — Aim: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} if there were differences in drinking patterns in patients with alcohol dependence (AD), with or without cirrhosis. Methods: We examined three groups in regard to differences in drinking patterns. We collected information from 50 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (AC), 50 patients with AD, and 40 patients with non-alcoholic cirrhosis (NAC). We used the structured interview Lifetime Drinking History (LDH) to measure the alcohol consumed. Information regarding the total lifetime alcohol intake (LAI), drinking days (DD), drinks per drinking day (DDD), their beverage preferences, and their binge consumption was collected during interviews. Results: Women drank less than men. Women with AC reported 9, 198 drinks as binge drinking compared to 25, 890 drinks for women with AD without liver cirrhosis (P < 0. 05), Women with AC reported 14, 009 drinks of alcohol consumed during their lifetime compared to 45, 658 drinks consumed by men with AC (P < 0. 0001). Women with AD had drunk 5. 8 DDD, and men had 8. 5 DDD (P < 0. 05). Both women and men with AC had significantly fewer DDD compared to men and women with AD without cirrhosis, 4. 4 drinks for women (P = 0. 046) and 6. 2 for men (P = 0. 048) with AC.

40|$|Abstract Objectives Surface electromyographic (sEMG) {{studies were}} {{performed}} on 40 adult patients following extraction of lower third and second molars to research the approach and limitations of sEMG evaluation of their odynophagia complaints. Methods Parameters evaluated during swallowing and drinking include the timing, number of swallows per 100 cc of water, and range (amplitude) of EMG activity of m. masseter, infrahyoid and submental-submandibular group. The above mentioned variables (mean + standard deviation) were measured for the group of dental patients (n = 40) and control group of healthy adults (n = 40). Results The duration of swallows and drinking in all tests showed increase in dental patients' group, in which this tendency is statistically significant. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between male and female adults' duration and amplitude of muscle activity during <b>continuous</b> <b>drinking</b> in both groups (p = 0. 05). The mean of electric activity (in μV) of m. masseter was significantly lower in the dental patients' group in comparison with control group. The electric activity of submental-submandimular and infrahyoid muscle groups was the same in both groups. Conclusion Surface EMG of swallowing is a simple and reliable noninvasive method for evaluation of odynophagia/dysphagia complaints following dental extraction with low level of discomfort of the examination. The surface EMG studies prove that dysphagia following dental extraction and molar surgery has oral origin, does not affect pharingeal segment and submental-submandibular muscle group. This type of dysphagia has clear EMG signs: increased duration of single swallow, longer drinking time, low range of electric activity of m. masseter, normal range of activity of submental-submandibular muscle group, and the "dry swalow" aftereffect. The data can be used for evaluation of complaints and symptoms, as well as for comparison purposes in pre- and postoperative stages and in EMG monitoring during treatment of post-surgical oral cavity discomfort and dysphagia. </p...|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Alcohol {{and cocaine}} are {{commonly}} co-abused drugs, and those meeting criteria for both cocaine {{and alcohol use}} disorders experience more severe behavioral and health consequences than those with a single disorder. Chronic alcohol (ethanol) drinking increased the reinforcing and dopamine (DA) neuronal stimulating effects of ethanol within mesolimbic regions of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) of alcohol-preferring (P) rats. The objectives of the current study were to determine if chronic <b>continuous</b> ethanol <b>drinking</b> produced: (1) alterations in the sensitivity of the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) to the reinforcing effects of cocaine, (2) changes in the magnitude and time course of the local stimulating effects of cocaine on posterior ventral tegmental area (pVTA) DA neurons, and (3) a persistence of alterations in the stimulating effects of cocaine after a period of protracted abstinence. Female P rats received continuous, free-choice access to water and 15 % v/v ethanol for at least 10 wk (continuous ethanol-drinking; CE) or access to water alone (ethanol-naïve; N). A third group of rats received the same period of ethanol access followed by 30 d of protracted abstinence from ethanol (ethanol-abstinent; Ab). CE and Ab rats consumed, on average, 6 - 7 g/kg/d of ethanol. Animals with a single cannula aimed at the AcbSh responded for injections of cocaine into the AcbSh during four initial operant sessions. Cocaine was not present in the self-infused solution for the subsequent three sessions, and cocaine access was restored during one final session. Animals with dual ipsilateral cannulae aimed at the AcbSh and the pVTA were injected with pulsed microinfusions of cocaine into the pVTA while DA content was collected for analysis through a microdialysis probe inserted into the AcbSh. During the initial four sessions, neither CE nor N rats self-infused artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) or 0. 1 mM cocaine into the AcbSh. CE, but not N, rats self-administered 0. 5 mM cocaine into the AcbSh, whereas both groups self-infused concentrations of 1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0, or 8. 0 mM cocaine. When cocaine access was restored in Session 8, CE rats responded more on the active lever and obtained more infusions of 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, or 4. 0 mM cocaine compared to N rats. Microinjection of aCSF into the pVTA did not alter AcbSh DA levels in N, CE, or Ab rats. Microinjections of 0. 25 mM cocaine into the pVTA did not significantly alter AcbSh DA levels in N animals, moderately increased DA levels in CE rats, and greatly increased DA levels in Ab rats. Microinjections of 0. 5 mM cocaine into the pVTA modestly increased AcbSh DA levels in N animals, robustly increased DA levels in CE rats, and did not significantly alter DA levels in Ab rats. Microinjections of 1. 0 or 2. 0 mM cocaine into the pVTA modestly increased AcbSh DA levels in N animals but decreased DA levels in CE and Ab rats. Overall, long-term <b>continuous</b> ethanol <b>drinking</b> by P rats enhanced both the reinforcing effects of cocaine within the AcbSh and the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of cocaine on pVTA DA neurons. Alterations in the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of cocaine on pVTA DA neurons were not only enduring, but also enhanced, following a period of protracted abstinence from ethanol exposure. Translationally, prevention of chronic and excessive alcohol intake in populations with a genetic risk for substance abuse may reduce the likelihood of subsequent cocaine use...|$|R
40|$|Brain {{development}} in mammals is long lasting. It begins early during embryonic growth and is finalized in early adulthood. This progression represents a delicate choreography of molecular, cellular and physiological processes initiated {{and directed by}} the fetal genotype in close interaction with environment. Not surprisingly, most aberrations in brain functioning including mental retardation are attributed to either gene(s), or environment or {{the interaction of the}} two. The ensuing complexity has made the assessment of this choreography, ever challenging. A model to assess this complexity has used a mouse model (C 57 BL/ 6 J or B 6) that is subjected to prenatal alcohol exposure. The resulting pups show learning and memory deficits similar to patients with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which is associated with life-long changes in gene expression. Interestingly, this change in gene expression underlies epigenetic processes including DNA methylation and miRNAs. This paradigm is applicable to ethanol exposure at different developmental times (binge at trimesters 1, 2 and 3 as well as <b>continuous</b> preference <b>drinking</b> (70 %) of 10 % alcohol by B 6 females during pregnancy). The exposure leads to life-long changes in neural epigenetic marks, gene expression, and a variety of defects in neurodevelopment and CNS function. We argue that this cascade may be reversed postnatally via drugs, chemicals and environment including maternal care. Such conclusions are supported by two sets of results. First, antipsychotic drugs that are used to treat mental disability including psychosis function via changes in DNA methylation, a major epigenetic mark.

40|$|High and low ethanol-drinking rodents show similar {{preferences}} for sweet solutions. Studies {{have suggested that}} sweet preference may be a reliable predictor of ethanol consumption in all rodents and, furthermore, that the sweet-ethanol relationship is mediated by a common biological mechanism. The present thesis investigated the role of taste preferences in ethanol intake in rats, {{to determine whether the}} relationship between ethanol and sweet intake was universal. Bitter and bittersweet solution intake were also compared with ethanol, based on research that rats find unflavoured ethanol to have a sweet and bitter taste. Fluid intake correlations among rat strains were examined following manipulation of the gabaergic, dopaminergic or opioidergic systems in order to reveal a common neural system mediating ethanol, sweet or bitter solution intake. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that saccharin and ethanol intake were not related in four rat strains. However, ethanol intake was related to saccharin-quinine intake in those strains. Experiment 3 demonstrated that intake of dilute quinine differentiated Fawn-Hooded, Lewis and Wistar rats in a similar manner to ethanol intake, suggesting that taste {{preferences for}} bitter solutions, and not sweet solutions, were a more reliable predictor of ethanol intake. Neither the GABA A agonist THIP, the dopamine D 2 /D 3 antagonist raclopride nor the opioidergic antagonist naltrexone succeeded in altering ethanol, saccharin and quinine intake in a consistent manner in Experiment 4. Naltrexone was shown to have no effect on the intake of five flavoured fluids during <b>continuous</b> access <b>drinking,</b> but did attenuate all but quinine intake during limited access drinking. It was unclear whether the effects achieved during limited access were due to a change in palatability or some nonspecific drug effect (e. g., attenuation of locomotor activity). Overall, the findings from the current experiments challenged the notion that sweet solution preference is associated with ethanol intake in all rats, and that the opioid system is mediating this relationship. Results showed that while fluid intake interrelationships varied among the four strains tested, ethanol intake was most closely associated with the intake of a bitter and a sweet-bitter solution. In addition, the fluid intake relationships {{did not appear to be}} mediated by the gabaergic, dopaminergic or opioidergic systems...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 In higher vertebrates, normal {{digestion}} and absorption by the {{gastrointestinal tract}} {{are dependent on}} the orderly and controlled transit of intraluminal contents. A relationship between fluid passage through the gut and absorption from the gut {{has yet to be}} examined in fish. In marine teleosts, the osmolality and ion concentration of the ingested seawater (SW) must be lowered before water absorption is initiated. By assuming that these processes are related to fluid transit, it is likely that alterations in these processes {{as well as in the}} water-electrolyte balance (WEB) of the animal would result with changes in the transit of intraluminal fluid. I hypothesized that marine teleosts regulate gut motility to achieve essential water absorption and thereby maintain the WEB. To test this, the gut of a marine teleost, the buffalo sculpin (Enophrys bison G.), was challenged in situ with forced <b>drinking</b> (<b>continuous</b> perfusion) at rates above and below that of the measured drinking rate (DR). Initially, the sensitivity of the WEB of the sculpin to preparatory manipulations that were essential for testing the above proposal was determined. The WEB was monitored before, during and after manipulation that included handling, containment, benzocaine-induced anesthesia, arterial and esophageal cannulation and serial sampling of blood. To monitor the WEB, indicators of the osmotic status and the intravascular volume were measured. Within one to three hours after surgery, a hyper-osmotic hemodilution resulted from an influx of hyper-osmotic fluid. Blood volume increased about 18...|$|R
40|$|The CD 26 -associated enzymatic {{activity}} of dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP 4) {{as well as}} the recruitment of CD 26 + T cells increase under allergic airway inflammation. Furthermore, genetic deficiency of CD 26 /DPP 4 exerts protective effects in experimental asthma. Therefore, CD 26 /DPP 4 might represent a novel therapeutic target in asthma. To study the effects of pharmacological inhibition of DPP 4 on allergic airway inflammation the DPP 4 -inhibitor isoleucine thiazolidide was tested using different doses at different time points (at sensitization, immediately before and simultaneously with the allergen challenge, as well as continuously via drinking water), and different routes (intraperitoneal, oral, and by inhalation). Allergic-like airway inflammation was induced in Fischer 344 rats (Charles River) sensitized against ovalbumin (OVA) using OVA aerosols. Intraperitoneal application of the DPP 4 inhibitor showed effects neither at sensitization nor at challenge, whereas a <b>continuous</b> application via <b>drinking</b> water using high doses of the inhibitor led to an aggravation of the histomorphological signs of airway inflammation. In contrast, aerosolization of the DPP 4 inhibitor simultaneously with the allergen significantly reduced airway hyperresponsiveness and ameliorated histopathological signs compared to controls. In addition, this treatment resulted in increased mRNA levels of surfactant proteins, suggesting an involvement of DPP 4 inhibitors in surfactant metabolism in OVA-challenged rats. Continuous systemic inhibition of DPP 4 via the oral route aggravates allergic airway inflammation. In contrast, topical inhibition of DPP 4 exerts potential protective effects, and further research in humans is needed...|$|R
50|$|A casual {{glance at}} the {{repertoire}} of pottery is enough to bring home the conspicuous absence of dishes. It is therefore not unlikely that besides the dough, much of the food was in liquid or semi liquid form. The quantities are also significant inasmuch as they enable us to infer the probable use of each pottery form. Thus, the coarse red/gray ware basins and jars and the handmade jars were probably used for storage purposes. The painted ware bowls, concave and convex sided, could have served as the table ware and the spouted ones for <b>drinking</b> water. The <b>channel</b> spouted bowls {{may have been used}} as milk bowls and the high and short necked jars for storing water. From the number of eating bowls, {{it appears to be a}} rather large family, perhaps six to eight persons, young and old together. Even today this is the average size of a family in an Indian village. This information helps for calculating the population of Inamgaon in the Late Jorwe phase. The area occupied by the people during this phase is large enough for about 200 to 250 huts, and, if presume an average family unit of five to six persons, the population of Inamgaon in the first quarter of the first millennium B.C. would have been from about a thousand to twelve hundred. This is quite sizable. In fact, Inamgaon may have been one of the most populous settlements of the culture.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of hyperglycaemia and {{its association with}} socioeconomic factors have been well studied in developed countries, however, {{little is known about}} them in transforming rural China. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in 4 rural communities of Deqing County located in East China in 2006 - 07, including 4, 506 subjects aged 18 to 64 years. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was measured. Subjects were considered to have impaired fasting glucose (IFG) if FPG was in the range from 5. 6 to 6. 9 mmol/L and to have diabetes mellitus (DM) if FG was 7. 0 mmol/L or above. Results The crude prevalences of IFG and DM were 5. 4 % and 2. 2 %, respectively. The average ratio of IFG/DM was 2. 5, and tended to be higher for those under the age of 35 years than older subjects. After adjustment for covariates including age (continuous), sex, BMI (<b>continuous),</b> smoking, alcohol <b>drinking,</b> and regular leisure physical activity, subjects in the high household income group had a significantly higher risk of IFG compared with the medium household income group (OR: 1. 74, 95 % CI: 1. 11 - 2. 72) and no significant difference in IFG was observed between the low and medium household income groups. Education and farmer occupation were not significantly associated with IFG. Conclusions High household income was significantly associated with an increased risk of IFG. A high ratio of IFG/DM suggests a high risk of diabetes in foreseeable future in the Chinese transforming rural communities. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cadmium (Cd) {{present in}} the air, {{drinking}} water and food {{has the potential to}} affect the health of peo-ple, mainly those who live in highly industrialized regions. Cd affects placental function, may cross the placental barrier and directly modify fetal development. It is also excreted into milk. The body is particularly susceptible to Cd exposure during perinatal period. The effect on rat oral epithelium (floor of the mouth) after <b>continuous</b> expo-sure to <b>drinking</b> water containing low levels of Cd during lactation was studied. Female rats were supplied with ad libitum drinking water containing 300 mg/l of CdCl 2 throughout the whole lactation period. Control animals received a similar volume of water without Cd. Lactating rats (21 day-old) were killed by lethal dose of anesthetic. The heads were retrieved, fixed in “alfac ” solution (alcohol, acetic acid and formaldehyde) for 24 h, serially sec-tioned in frontal plane, {{at the level of the}} first molars. The 6 µm sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Nuclear epithelium parameters were estimated, as well as cytoplasm and cell volume, nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, numeric and surface densities, and epithelial thickness. Mean body weight was 34. 86 g for the control group and 18. 56 g for the Cd-treated group. Histologically, the floor of the mouth epithelium was thinner in the treated group, with smaller and more numerous cells. In this experiment, Cd induced epithelial hypotrophy, indicating a direct action in oral mucosa cells, besides retarded development of the pups.

40|$|Background: Various {{scales are}} {{available}} today to assess individuals’ health literacy (hl). Based on scores from those scales, some studies found positive correlations between health literacy and healthy behaviors. However, {{very little is}} known about how much (more) health literacy does it take {{to make a difference in}} individuals’ health behaviors. Methods: We analyzed data from the Swiss Federal Survey of Adolescents (YASS) 2010 - 2011 to study the associations between young Swiss men’s hl scores and their physical act ivity, smoking, binge drinking, and energy drink use (n= 9516). We used the “Health literacy among young adults scale” (scores ranging range 0 - 37). Linear regression analysis was applied to explore the association between continuous hl scores and <b>continuous</b> smoking or <b>drinking</b> scores. Logistic regression analysis was used to predict the likelihood of engaging in health behaviors by health literacy score quartiles. Analysis were conducted separately for three educational classes. Results: Coefficients for continuous effects were small (r=- 0. 2 for number of cigarettes per day; r= - 0. 04 for number of drinks per binge drinking). Health literacy sum score quartiles showed substantial associations: across all educational classes the odds of being physically active (OR= 2. 86, p< 0. 001), being a non-smoker (1. 51, p< 0. 001) and not consuming energy drinks regularly (OR= 1. 49, p< 0. 001) were increased among persons in the highest health literacy score quartile compared to those in the lowest. Moreover, effect sizes varied substantially across educational classes. Conclusion: We found no meaningful differences in small point variations of health literacy for health behaviors among young Swiss men. However, bigger differences in health literacy scores were associated with particular health behaviors and these associations may be particularly meaningful in some educational groups...|$|R
