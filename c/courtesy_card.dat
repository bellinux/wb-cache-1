The Jackal becomes Martin — complete with French identity card and war wounded <b>card</b> <b>courtesy</b> of a Belgian forger — by dyeing his hair grey and cutting it badly, swallowing a couple of pieces of cordite to make himself sick and affect a pale complexion, and folding his leg back and binding it with a webbing strap to mimic an amputated leg.|$|R

It was a similar story in his second season as he only played in the World Games (lost 3-0 to Lü Haotian in the first round) and the Six-red World Championship (failed to advance beyond the group stage).|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} half of 2006 she won the third ITF tournament of her career in Hull and reached the semifinals of another ITF, this one in Tenerife, as a {{qualifier}} before losing to Andrea Hlaváčková. In the run-up to Wimbledon 2006, South played two WTA tournaments <b>courtesy</b> of wild <b>cards.</b> She lost {{in the first round of}} the DFS Classic in Birmingham (tier III) to fellow wild card Sarah Borwell in three sets, and also lost in the first round of qualifying for the tier II tournament in Eastbourne. In June, South played for the first time in the Wimbledon main draw as a wild card and reached the second round by beating number 11 seed Francesca Schiavone in the first round. She lost to Shenay Perry in the second round. South's win over world number 14 Schiavone was a career-first top-20 victory, and the best win in terms of ranking for a British player since Sam Smith beat number 7 Conchita Martínez at Wimbledon in 1998. After Wimbledon, South won another ITF tournament, reached three semifinals and two more quarterfinals. She participated in the qualifying tournament for the US Open in September but did not progress further than the first round. Her year-end ranking was world number 176.|$|R
