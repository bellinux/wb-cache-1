While this is a reasonable approach for financial markets, such approach may have ignore some important information in the property market. We examine price-volume relation in Hong Kong property market using transaction based repeat-sales index and volume of different types of transactions. Our study distinguishes itself from others in several ways. Firstly, we have analysed the impacts of three different types of transactions (normal transactions, pre-sale transactions and <b>confirmor</b> transactions) on the transaction prices. Secondly, both the first and second moment effects of volume on prices are examined. Thirdly, we have also tested for structural breaks in the price volume relationships. Our data show that total transaction volume leads price, which is consistent with the search model. We found that pre-sale transactions depress spot market returns while <b>confirmor</b> transactions do the opposite; and that <b>confirmor</b> transactions stabilise property prices while pre-sales transactions increases price volatility. We propose that developerís pricing strategies have {{played an important role in}} explaining the effects of presale transaction on the first and second moment of property prices. Developers under-price their unfinished units as a means of promoting sales of their unsold units. Thus, presale transactions have an negative impact on property price returns. However, the extent of under pricing varies across different developers and phases of pre-sale, therefore as the volume of presale transaction increases, the volatility of property prices also increases. <b>Confirmor</b> transactions are speculative forward contract transactions and are priced in the market like other completed units. The stabilising effects of <b>confirmor</b> transactions are consistent with results in finance literature that transactions in the futures market stabilise spot market prices. The positive impact of <b>confirmor</b> transactions on property price returns is due to the incomplete nature of the property market ñ impossibility of short selling. Speculators can only speculate up but not down. We have found structural breaks in the relationships between transaction volume and property prices during the period of Asian Financial Crisis (AFC). The AFC has introduced unexpected exchange rate risks and increased the volatility interest rates. However, the above results are not materially affected by replacing structural break dummy variable with interest rate. The nature of the structural breaks remains an area for further studies...|$|E

During off season itsurvives in the soil, on weeds and in crop residues. A 6 months study was {{conducted}} in controlledconditions (microcosms of natural soil, 17 °C, 80 %WHC) to test whether the presence of DON inthe wheat crop residues gives advantages to F. graminearum to survive and develop a primaryinoculum during the decomposition process. This study was carried out {{in the presence of the}} wholesoil biota (i. e. fungi, bacteria, protozoa, nematodes and earthworms). Both F. graminearum and thebiota were monitored during the decomposition process. The wheat crop residues were placed onthe soil surface or incorporated into the natural soil. This experiment was conducted with (1 mgDON/kg soil-straw mixture) and without DON. This study suggested that the mycotoxins provideda competitive advantage to F. graminearum and were deleterious towards the fungal communityand the nematodes but not towards the bacteria or the earthworms. However, all the results were notstatistically significant. The use of molecular tools as well as the forthcoming quantification ofDON in the residues during 24 weeks of observation will provide the clarification and may <b>confirmor</b> not the trends we observed...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{training}} must involve overload, {{but also}} must avoid {{the combination of}} excessive overload plus inadequate recovery. Athletes can experience short-term performance decrement, without severe psychological, or lasting other negative symptoms. This Functional Overreaching (FOR) will eventually lead to an improvement in performance after recovery. When athletes do not sufficiently respect the balance between training and recovery, Non-Functional Overreaching (NFOR) can occur. The distinction between NFOR and the Overtraining Syndrome (OTS) is very difficult and {{will depend on the}} clinical outcome and exclusion diagnosis. The athlete will often show the same clinical, hormonal and other signs and symptoms. A keyword in the recognition of OTS might be prolonged maladaptation not only of the athlete, but also of several biological, neurochemical, and hormonal regulation mechanisms. It is generally thought that symptoms of OTS, such as fatigue, performance decline and mood disturbances, are more severe than those of NFOR. However, there is no scientific evidence to either <b>confirmor</b> refute this suggestion. One approach to understanding the aetiology of OTS involves the exclusion of organic diseases or infections and factors such as dietary caloric restriction (negative energy balance) and insufficient carbohydrate and/or protein intake, iron deficiency, magnesium deficiency, allergies, etc., together with identification of initiating events or triggers. In this paper, we provide the recent status of possible markers for the detection of OTS. Currently several markers (hormones, performance tests, psychological tests, biochemical and immune markers) are used, but none of them meets all criteria to make its use generally accepted...|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of why different events have occurred has always been in human being&# 39;s mind and challenged his curiosity. The question word "why" is used {{to ask about the}} cause of a phenomenon,and if man was not aware of the law of causality and did not confirm that every phenomenon needed a cause, he could not imagine any questions with "why". About this law and its related subjects such as compatibility between cause and effect, many schools and theories have emerged, among which, the schools of Tafká¿k(Segregation) and MulÄá¹¢adrÄare of special importance. The proponents of Tafká¿k believe in the segregation of philosophical – theosophical instructions and religious contents. They reject many of the principles of philosophy by referring to Quran and Hadiths and conclude that philosophy is in contradiction with Quranic teachings. The school of MulÄá¹¢adrÄ however, has a comprehensive view and incudes as its principles all teachings gained from wisdom, texts, theosophy and reasoning. One of the controversial issues discussed by both schools is the subject of compatibility between cause and effect. It is obvious that every effect does not stem from any cause and even there is not always causal relation between concurrent and subsequent phenomena, rather the causality exists only between specific beings. In other words, there must be specialcongruencybetween cause and effect which is referred to as compatibility between cause and effect. Since cause is what brings about the existence of effect and gives it reality, then it itself should possess the existence which it gives to the effect. When one object lacks something, it cannot give it to the other. Because by giving existence to the effect, the existence of cause will not be negated, it becomes clear that cause possesses the existence in a perfect way so that the existence of effect is regarded as a beam of light radiated from cause. The scholars of the school of Tafká¿khowever, believe that compatibility between cause and effect may lead to some clearly rejected consequences such as rejection of monotheism, oxymoron and …. As a result they refuse this law. In this study, the subject of compatibility between cause and effect according to the schools of Tafká¿k and MulÄá¹¢adrÄhas been compared. First, the influence of compatibility between cause and effect on God&# 39;s cognition in both schools has been discussed, then the bases and reasons for which these schools either <b>confirmor</b> reject the idea of compatibility have been introduced and compared with Quranic and traditional proofs. In the end, two principles of "Indivisible Reality" and "The object causing something cannot devoid of it" will be offered as two proofs necessitating compatibility...|$|E
