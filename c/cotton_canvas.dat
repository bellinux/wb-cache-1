25|$|Vegans may avoid {{clothing}} that incorporates silk, wool (including lambswool, shearling, cashmere, angora, mohair, {{and a number}} of other fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, or leather, snakeskin, or any other kind of skin or animal product. Most leather clothing is made from cow skins. Vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry. Vegans may wear clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials, such as hemp, linen, <b>cotton,</b> <b>canvas,</b> polyester, synthetic leather (pleather), rubber, or vinyl. Leather alternatives can come from materials, such as cork, piña(from pineapples), and mushroom leather.|$|E
25|$|Joan Miró {{was one of}} {{the first}} and most {{successful}} stain painters. Although staining in oil was considered dangerous to <b>cotton</b> <b>canvas</b> in the long run, Miró's example during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s was an inspiration and an influence on the younger generation. One of the reasons for the success of the Color Field movement was the technique of staining. Artists would mix and dilute their paint in buckets or coffee cans making a fluid liquid and then they would pour it into raw unprimed canvas, generally cotton duck. The paint could also be brushed on or rolled on or thrown on or poured on or sprayed on, and would spread into the fabric of the canvas. Generally artists would draw shapes and areas as they stained. Many different artists employed staining as the technique of choice to use in making their paintings. James Brooks, Jackson Pollock, Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Paul Jenkins and dozens of other painters found that pouring and staining opened the door to innovations and revolutionary methods of drawing and expressing meaning in new ways. The number of artists who stained in the 1960s greatly increased with the availability of acrylic paint. Staining acrylic paint into the fabric of cotton duck canvas was more benign and less damaging to the fabric of the canvas than the use of oil paint.|$|E
2500|$|DNC paratroopers wore {{dark blue}} {{fatigues}} (other sources {{described it as}} black), whose cut followed closely that of the US Army OG-107 jungle utilities, to distinguish them {{from the rest of}} the Royal Lao Armed Forces (FAR). [...] Service headgear consisted on a badgeless black beret worn American-style, pulled to the right – in contrast to the FAR, where berets were still being worn pulled to the left in typical French fashion – reflecting the influence of the training cadres received from the Thai PARU in 1962; in the field, the beret was often replaced by a US M-1C jump helmet. Regulation footwear were the calf-length French M1950 or M1950/53 TAP (French: Bottes de saut modéle 1950 et 1950/53) black leather jump-boot models and the US Army M-1962 [...] "McNamara" [...] black leather combat boots. Web gear was a mix of US M-1945 and M-1956 Load-Carrying Equipments (LBE), respectively in khaki and Olive Green <b>cotton</b> <b>canvas</b> and standard issue in the FAR.|$|E

60|$|Materials for Tenting.--Light canvas {{is usually}} employed, and is, to {{all intents and}} purposes, waterproof. Silk, of equal {{strength}} with the canvas, is very far lighter: its only disadvantage is its expense. Calico, or <b>cotton</b> <b>canvas,</b> is very generally used for small tents. Leather and felt are warm, but exceedingly heavy; and would only be used in very inclement climates, or where canvas could not be met with. Light matting {{is not to be}} despised: it is warm and pretty durable, and makes excellent awning or covering to a frame-work.|$|E
60|$|The tents of the Indian native regiments are large, oblong tents, {{with two}} poles, holding thirty men each. They are {{manufactured}} {{at the government}} prison at Jubbalpore, and are made of thick <b>cotton</b> <b>canvas,</b> lined with red or blue cotton. In the daytime they open right along one side, {{the wall of the}} tent being propped outward, with two slight poles, so as to form a sort of veranda, and shade the inside of the tent while admitting the air. At night-time, in the cool season, this flap is let down and the tent closed. In front of the tents the muskets of the men inside are piled.|$|E
60|$|Our {{ship had}} two masts, if masts {{they can be}} called c which were great {{moveable}} triangles. If in an ordinary ship you replace the shrouds and backstay by strong timbers, and take away the mast altogether, you have the arrangement adopted on board a prau. Above my cabin, and resting on cross-beams attached to the masts, was a wilderness of yards and spars, mostly formed of bamboo. The mainyard, an immense affair nearly a hundred feet long, was formed of many pieces of wood and bamboo bound together with rattans in an ingenious manner. The sail carried by this was of an oblong shape, and was hung out of the centre, {{so that when the}} short end was hauled down on deck the long end mounted high in the air, making up for the lowness of the mast itself. The foresail was of the same shape, but smaller. Both these were of matting, and, with two jibs and a fore and aft sail astern of <b>cotton</b> <b>canvas,</b> completed our rig.|$|E

50|$|The term 'windcheater' is {{also used}} to {{describe}} a retail item used on the beach and camping to prevent wind from disturbing social enjoyment. Normally made from <b>cotton,</b> nylon, <b>canvas</b> and recycled sails, windbreaks tend to have three or more panels, held in place with poles that slide into pockets sewn into the panel. The poles are then hammered into the ground and a windbreak is formed.|$|R

50|$|In army parlance, a gaiter covers leg and bootlacing; a legging covers {{only the}} leg. In RAF parlance, gaiter {{includes}} legging. The American Army during World War I and World War II had leggings, which were gaiters. Above the knee spatterdashes were <b>cotton</b> or <b>canvas,</b> as were many gaiters of varying lengths thereafter. Leather gaiters were rare in military, though sometimes a calf-length cotton gaiter had leather kneecaps added. Leggings, however, were very often made of leather, but also canvas.|$|R
5000|$|Fences called [...] "windbreaks" [...] {{are also}} used.

The poles are then hammered {{into the ground and}} a windbreak is formed. Windbreaks or [...] "wind fences" [...] are used to reduce wind speeds over erodible areas such as open fields, industrial stockpiles, and dusty industrial operations. As erosion is proportional to wind speed cubed a reduction of wind speed of 1/2 (for example) will reduce erosion by over 80%.|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of this lightweight rucksack led to an informal inquiry by officers of the infantry community as {{to the possibility of}} reducing the weight of the M-1956 Load-Carrying Equipment (LCE). As a result of this interest, the army produced a set of LCE in 1962, substituting available nylon materials for the <b>cotton</b> <b>canvas</b> duck. This set of nylon load-carrying equipment weighed slightly more than 3 lb as opposed to 5 lb for the <b>cotton</b> <b>canvas</b> duck items. These two items, the lightweight rucksack and the set of nylon LCE, formed the basis for that portion of the LINCLOE Quantitative Material Requirement dealing with load-carrying equipment. Annex A to the Quantitative Material Requirement set a goal of 3.3 lb for the individual load-carrying equipment and 3 lb for the rucksack. Officials decided that the design of the new load-carrying equipment would follow that of the standard load-carrying equipment with material changes from <b>cotton</b> <b>canvas</b> duck to nylon duck and replacement of the brass and steel hardware with aluminum or plastic items.|$|E

25|$|The third flag {{carried by}} the Third Arkansas is an Army of Northern Virginia Battle Flag pattern made of bunting and <b>cotton</b> with <b>canvas</b> lead, 47 inches × 46 inches. Glenn Dedmondt {{identifies}} the flag as a 3rd bunting issue flag made by the Richmond Depot. The flag was issued to the unit on September 20, 1863, {{on the field of}} Chickamauga, and was probably carried until approximately 1 January 1865. Private Spencer Young, who was wounded carrying the flag in the Battle of the Wilderness, saved the flag and carried it back to the state. It remained in his custody until donated to the Old State House Museum, Little Rock in the 1920s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{best known}} {{products}} of Tilley Endurables are their hats, they {{are referred to}} as [...] "iconic", and [...] "legendary." [...] The hats are made of <b>cotton</b> duck <b>canvas,</b> and include a brim that snaps up. As the hats were originally made for sailing, they include holes to allow air to pass through, to prevent them from blowing off. Tilley hats also float. Tilley customers often write stories on the Tilley website, explaining strange experiences they have had with the hats. One such story (and shown as part of an advertisement) includes a hat being eaten by an elephant, and defecated out later that week entirely intact. Tilley hats are guaranteed for life, and will be replaced at no charge should the hat wear out. They are also replaced at 50% of the cost if they are lost or stolen.|$|R

50|$|Folding kayaks are direct {{descendants}} of the skin-on-frame boats used by the Inuit and Greenlandic peoples. Modern folding kayaks are constructed from a wooden or aluminum frame over which is placed a synthetic skin made of polyester, <b>cotton</b> <b>canvas,</b> polyurethane, or Hypalon. They are more expensive than inflatable kayaks, but {{have the advantage of}} greater stiffness and consequently better seaworthiness.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} types of room dividers such as cubicle partitions, pipe and drape screens, shoji screens, and walls. Room dividers can be made from many materials, including wood, fabric, plexiglass, framed <b>cotton</b> <b>canvas,</b> pleated fabric or mirrors. Plants, shelves or railings might also be used as dividers. Portable room dividers have folded wall panels supported on wheels.|$|E
50|$|Tents {{are often}} used in {{humanitarian}} emergencies, such as war, earthquakes and fire. The primary choice of tents in humanitarian emergencies are canvas tents, because a <b>cotton</b> <b>canvas</b> tent allows functional breathability while serving the purpose of temporary shelter. Tents distributed by organisations such as UNHCR are made by various manufacturers, depending on the region where the tents are deployed, as well as depending on the purpose.|$|E
5000|$|The {{painting}} was made using acrylic Liquitex {{on a white}} <b>cotton</b> duck <b>canvas,</b> with no underdrawing. Hockney uses a limited palette - cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, raw sienna, burnt sienna, raw umber, Hooker's green, Naples yellow and titanium white - applied either mixed together or as tints. Apart from the splash, the {{painting was}} finished very evenly and flat with a paint roller, {{in two or three}} layers, with the few details - tree, grass, chair, reflections - overpainted. The central splash was heavily worked over a period of about two weeks using a variety of small brushes. A wide border and central narrow stripe at the pool's edge are left unpainted. The border creates an effect like a Polaroid photograph. The painting has been viewed as a critical link in Hockney's ruminations on time between his earlier Picture Emphasising Stillness and his later [...] "joiners" [...] portraits, created by collaging many photographs of the same subject taken over a period of hours.|$|R
50|$|The United States Army {{entered the}} {{conflict}} in Southeast Asia with the <b>canvas</b> and <b>cotton</b> duck M-1956 Load-Carrying Equipment (LCE). Developed in the early 1950s, the LCE was designed for use with all small arms then in service with the Army. Deficiencies with the LCE were immediately realized once fielded in the tropical climates of Vietnam. <b>Canvas,</b> <b>cotton</b> duck and webbing, even when treated to prevent mildew, is still affected by it, along with dry rot due to constant wetting and drying. Cotton also absorbed {{a great deal of}} water, adding to its weight, and was slow drying; it also withstood abrasion poorly.|$|R
