50|$|The two {{variable}} frequency oscillators track {{each other at}} frequencies 100 kHz apart. The output of a 0.5-250 MHz oscillator, F1, is fed into a bridge. When the impedance network to be measured is connected one arm across the bridge, the equivalent parallel resistance and <b>reactance</b> (<b>capacitive</b> or inductive) unbalances the bridge and the resulting voltage is fed to the mixer. The output of the 0.6-250.1 MHz oscillator F2, tracking 100 kHz above F1,is also fed to the mixer. This results in a 100 kHz difference frequency proportional in level to the bridge unbalance. The difference frequency signal is amplified by a filter amplifier combination and is applied to a null meter. When the bridge resistive and reactive controls are nulled, their respective dials accurately indicate the parallel impedance components of the network under test.|$|R

Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal resistive load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.|$|R

Sorption and desorption behaviors of the solvents were determined by simultaneous registration of the impedance (Z) and the resistive (R, resistance) and <b>capacitive</b> (X, <b>reactance)</b> components of the Z under different potential bias and alternating current (ac) frequencies. The sensor responses were discussed considering the polar/non-polar and polarizability properties of the polymers and solvents.

The results supported that the dipolarity-polarizability properties of solvents have also a critical role on sensor response at low ac frequencies. The more polarizable solvents gave higher sensor responses at lower ac frequencies. The equilibrium response of the PSDA based sensor was correlated with the dielectric constant of the solvents. The values of Z and R of PSDA film under saturated solvent vapors at 1 kHz ac frequency were linearly correlated (R 2 was 0. 955, 0. 993 and 0. 957 for Z, R and X, respectively, in semi-logarithmic scale) with the values of the dielectric constants of the solvents, except water. A similar correlation (R 2 = 0. 996) was obtained by using the R values of the PSDA film at 100 kHz ac frequency. In the case of PSDA-b-PEG polymer film, it was also possible to establish an almost linear correlation (R 2 = 0. 943) between the R at 100 kHz ac frequency and the values of the dielectric constants of the solvents, except acetone and water.
