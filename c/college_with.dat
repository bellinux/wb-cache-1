Through my analysis of the admissions policies of twelve women’s colleges, I divide the colleges into four categories: <b>colleges</b> <b>with</b> self-identification policies, <b>colleges</b> <b>with</b> consistent identification policies, <b>colleges</b> <b>with</b> legal and/or medical policies, and <b>colleges</b> <b>with</b> no specific admissions policies...|$|R
