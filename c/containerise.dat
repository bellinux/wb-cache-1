40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the need for}} legal uniformity in the current field of international <b>containerised</b> multimodal transport, focusing on two parameters: a) the recognition of international <b>containerised</b> transport as a uniform and single transport process, entitled to its own legal framework and b) the reconsideration of {{the legal status of}} operators of transport terminals so as to bring their liability under a legal framework for international <b>containerised</b> transport. Thus, it {{examines the}} particularities of containerisation providing a general overview of the innovations it brought to the global distribution of cargo; discusses its interaction with international multimodal transport placing emphasis on the key role of terminal operators; looks at the legal framework of international <b>containerised</b> multimodal transport indicating that although it is a heavily integrated transport field, yet its legal framework remains disproportionately disharmonised; and finally examines the fragile legal status of terminal operators in international <b>containerised</b> transport to conclude that the regulation of terminal operators' liability should be fall within an overall effort to establish harmonised liability rules applicable throughout the entire international <b>containerised</b> transport.

50|$|Indian Railway's {{strategic}} {{initiative to}} <b>containerise</b> cargo transport put India on the intermodal freight transport map {{for the first}} time in 1966. Given India's size (almost 3000 km from North to South and East to West), rail transport is often a cheaper option for all cargo over medium and long distances, especially if the cost of inter-modal transfers can be reduced. Seeing that containerised multi-modal door-to-door transport provided a solution to this problem, in 1966 Indian Railways entered the market for moving door-to-door domestic cargo in special DSO containers.|$|E

40|$|In {{the effort}} to explore the {{subsurface}} of terrestrial bodies, we seek to obtain better samples from ever greater depths. Many organisations are working towards technologies that can achieve this goal whilst ensuring compatibility with the likely requirements of planetary landers in terms of mass, power, and dimensions. The Ultrasonic Planetary Core Drill (UPCD) was an FP 7 funded project which aimed to develop such a planetary sub-surface sample acquisition system, developing the required drill hardware and testing it in a Mars analogue environment in Antarctica. The objective was to reach 30 cm and <b>containerise</b> the samples using the least possible power, while operating at low weight-on-bit.

40|$|Most of {{the newly}} {{emerging}} states {{in the third world}} have been keen to establish their own merchant fleets since the political independence from the Western colonial powers. Some of them have sought for certain financial aid from the industrial countries in order to reinforce their national flag carriers. In the case of Sri Lanka, the Ceylon Shipping Corporation which was set up as a public enterprise in 1971, purchased eight second-hand cargo ships (85, 965 ton) at about 4. 8 billion yen and managed to transfer handsome profit to the state treasury annually from the inception of business. After the general election of 1977, the new government embarked along with her open economic policy on an ambitious project to <b>containerise</b> Colombo Harbour and replace the aged merchant fleet with highly modernised one. Then Japanese government pledged to support this project and offered concessional loans to both the Sri Lanka Port Authority and the Ceylon Shipping Corporation in spite of the prolonged recession in the global shipping market. For the latter project, the credit of 5. 8 billion yen with the interest of 3. 25 % for 30 years instalments (grace period of 10 years) was provided through the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund to the CSC to acquire only three multi-purpose vessels in 1981 although the Ministry of Trade and Shipping of Sri Lanka had requested the financial assistance to buy an entire fleetof 12 brand new ships. International tenders were called in 1981. With the rising cost of ships, however, it was possible to award orders for the building of two vessels (10, 000 ton cargo ship to carry 278 containers and 3, 000 ton cargo ship to carry 101 containers). Almost at the same time, the CSC placed the orders with a South Korean ship-builder for four vessels (two 9, 000 ton cargo ships to carry 440 containers each and two 3, 000 ton cargo ships to carry 175 containers each) at more reasonable cost of 8. 4 billion yen, and also to an Argentina ship-builder for three 10, 600 ton cargo ships to carry 537 containers each at the cost of 10. 1 billion yen. The terms of loan were 10 years instalments with 6 % interest for the Korean ships, and 12 years instalments with 7. 5 % interest for the Argentina ships. The author of this paper carried out a socio-economic survey in Tokyo and Colombo in 1986, and examined the economic rationale of the above vessels built by Japanese shipyards in comparison with the Korean vessels. Since the year of delivery (1982) of the new ships from Korea and Japan in place of the ageing conventional freighters, the CSC has successively experienced huge financial losses which have been heavy burdens upon the consecutive national budgets of Sri Lanka. The repayment of the interest and principals of the ship loans is the major contributory factor to the losses of the CSC, and the more serious financial difficulties will be envisaged in the trends of the appreciation of Japanese Yen vis-a-vsi the devaluation of Sri Lankan rupee. In the concluding remarks, the author proposes to reconsider such narrow economic justification of foreign aid as strict cost-benefit analysis, internal rate of returns and so on. After conducting field observations and document examinations in the wake of modernised fleets of the CSC, the article suggests the need to formulate more relevant criteria for the future economic cooperation projects with the third world nations...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is supported by}} the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Education Research Grant. Cloud computing providers have recently begun offering container instances, which provide an efficient route to application deployment within a lightweight, isolated and well-defined execution environment. Cloud providers currently offer Container Service Platforms (CSPs), which support the flexible orchestration of <b>containerised</b> applications. Existing CSP frameworks do not offer any form of intelligent resource scheduling: applications are usually scheduled individually,rather than taking a holistic view of all registered applications and available resources in the cloud. This can result in increased execution times for applications, resource wastage through underutilized container-instances, and a {{reduction in the number of}} applications that can be deployed, given the available resources. This paper presents a cloud-based Container Management Service(CMS) framework, which offers increased deployment density, scalability and resource efficiency for <b>containerised</b> applications. CMS extends the state-of-the-art by providing additional functionalities for orchestrating <b>containerised</b> applications by joint optimisation of sets of <b>containerised</b> applications and resource pool on the cloud. We evaluate CMS on a cloud-based CSP i. e., Amazon EC 2 Container Management Service (ECS) and conducted extensive experiments using sets of CPU and Memory intensive <b>containerised</b> applications against the direct deployment strategy of Amazon ECS. The results show that CMS achieves up to 25 % higher cluster utilisation and up to 2. 5 times faster execution times. Postprin...|$|R
