40|$|It {{is under}} debate whether {{healthcare}} {{costs related to}} death and in life years gained (LysG) due to life saving interventions {{should be included in}} economic evaluations. We estimated the impact of including these costs on cost-effectiveness of cancer screening. We obtained health insurance, home care, nursing homes, and mortality data for 2. 1 million inhabitants in the Netherlands in 1998 – 1999. Costs related to death were approximated by the healthcare <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> the last year of life (LastYL), by cause and age of death. <b>Costs</b> <b>in</b> LYsG were estimated by calculating the healthcare <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> any life year. We calculated the change in cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) if unrelated healthcare <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> the LastYL or in LYsG would be included. <b>Costs</b> <b>in</b> the LastYL were on average 33 % higher for persons dying from cancer than from any cause. Including <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> LysG increased the CER by € 4040 in women, and by € 4100 in men. Of these, € 660 in women, and € 890 <b>in</b> men, were <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> the LastYL. Including unrelated healthcare <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> the LastYL or in LYsG will change the comparative cost-effectiveness of healthcare programmes. The CERs of cancer screening programmes will clearly increase, with approximately € 4000.

5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except {{as one of a}} series of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E
