25|$|The pack is {{designed}} to prevent catastrophic cell failures from propagating to adjacent cells (thermal runaway), even when the cooling system is off. Coolant is pumped continuously through the ESS both when the car is running and when the car is turned off if the pack retains more than a 90% charge. The <b>coolant</b> <b>pump</b> draws 146 watts.

25|$|Two aluminium-alloy {{castings}} {{joined together}} on the horizontal centreline. The upper portion bears the wheelcase, cylinder blocks {{and part of the}} housing for the airscrew reduction gear; and carries the crankshaft main bearings (split mild-steel shells lined with lead–bronze alloy). The lower half forms an oil sump and carries the main pressure oil pump, supercharger change-speed operating pump and two scavenge pumps. It also houses the main <b>coolant</b> <b>pump</b> which is driven through the same gear-train as the oil pumps.|$|E

50|$|The S5G had primary <b>coolant</b> <b>pumps,</b> {{but they}} were only needed for very high speeds. And since the reactor core was {{designed}} with very smooth paths for the <b>coolant,</b> the <b>coolant</b> <b>pumps</b> were smaller and quieter than the ones used by the competing S5W core. They were also fewer in number. In most cases the submarine could be operated without using <b>coolant</b> <b>pumps</b> at all. The quiet design resulted in a larger hull diameter but required larger primary coolant piping than the competing S5W reactor. Due to the larger size, the S5G was not used in subsequent attack submarines, but was a precursor to the S8G reactor design used in the larger s.|$|R

5000|$|Diesel-electric {{submarines}} have a stealth {{advantage over}} their nuclear counterparts. Nuclear submarines generate noise from <b>coolant</b> <b>pumps</b> and turbo-machinery needed {{to operate the}} reactor, even at low power levels. Some nuclear submarines such as the American [...] can operate with their reactor <b>coolant</b> <b>pumps</b> secured, making them quieter than electric subs. A conventional submarine operating on batteries is almost completely silent, the only noise coming from the shaft bearings, propeller, and flow noise around the hull, all of which stops when the sub hovers in mid-water to listen, leaving only the noise from crew activity. Commercial submarines usually rely only on batteries, since they operate {{in conjunction with a}} mother ship.|$|R
