5|$|As {{with the}} k-type section, the image {{impedance}} of the m-type low-pass section is purely real below the cut-off frequency and purely imaginary above it. From the chart it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> in the passband the closest impedance match to a constant pure resistance termination occurs at approximately m = 0.6.|$|E
5|$|In Iberia, {{the western}} Mediterranean and {{northwest}} Africa, the common starling may {{be confused with}} the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour. At close range it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> the latter has longer throat feathers, a fact particularly noticeable when it sings.|$|E

5|$|The {{first known}} case of orbital {{resonance}} in exoplanets {{has been noted}} between Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c. The two planets, whose orbits correspond in a roughly 1:2 ratio, maintain the orbit of the other by gravitational tug. Kepler-9b's orbit grows, on average, four minutes longer every orbital period. Eventually, this trend will reverse and increase. Over time, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> the planets' orbits oscillate slightly {{above and below the}} 1:2 ratio. Alycia Weinberger of the Carnegie Institution has stated that the Kepler-9 gas giants probably formed further away from the star than they are, and the appearance of the orbital resonance phenomenon may help explain the history of their inward migration.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters can be viewed as special cases of the resonator expression with {{one or the other of}} the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter. In this way it, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it.|$|E
30|$|The {{recognition}} performance increase sharply at {{the very}} beginning because the filter can get more high-frequency variations of the information in the image. As increasing the filter size, the recognition performance tends to decrease. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> 11 <b>is</b> the best value for the filter size.|$|R

5|$|Given these {{properties}} of DNA damage and mutation, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> DNA damage {{is a special}} problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand {{at the expense of}} neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Megalosaurus is poorly known. The {{discovered}} skull elements are generally rather large {{in relation to}} the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that Megalosaurus had an uncommonly large head. The praemaxilla is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the maxilla was short. In the depression around the antorbital fenestra to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> is probably homologous to the fenestra maxillaris. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty denticula per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13–14/13–14. The jugal bone is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an air sac in the nasal bone. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate autapomorphy.|$|E
