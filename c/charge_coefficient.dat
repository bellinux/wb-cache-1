40|$|The {{impedance}} of the Au, O 2 (g) / yttria stabilized zirconia interface {{has been}} measured as {{function of the}} overpotential, temperature and oxygen partial pressure. At large cathodic overpotentials (η + 0. 1 V) inductive effects are observed in the impedance diagram at low frequencies. Those inductive effects result from a charge transfer mechanism where a stepwise transfer of electrons towards adsorbed oxygen species occurs. A model analysis shows that the inductive effects at cathodic overpotentials appear when the fraction of coverage {{of one of the}} intermediates increases with more negative cathodic overpotentials.
