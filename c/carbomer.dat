40|$|BACKGROUND: The dry eye sindrome {{refers to}} a group of {{disorders}} of the tear film due to reduced tear production or excessive tear evaporation that is associated with symptoms of ocular discomfort and may cause disease of the ocular surface. Dry eye syndrome varies in severity, duration and etiology. The cornerstone of dry eye syndrome therapies includes the intraocular gel or ophthalmic solutions instillation, reaching correct artificial lubrication. Molecules that can produce a stable lubricating film are the <b>carbomers.</b> METHODS: In the first step of our work we reviewed the data from literature reporting about carbomers’ characteristics in respect to other lacrimal substitutes. Then, a pharmacoeconomical analysis has been performed on ophtalmic gels derived from <b>carbomers</b> 974 P and PVA. RESULTS: Dry eye sindrome, if not adequately treated, determines a deterioration of the patient’s quality of life, other than high secondary costs. CONCLUSION: The high therapeutical index of <b>carbomers</b> 974 P and PVA-based gels, in addition to the their limited cost (totally free for Sjögren patients in Italy), suggests that this product is characterized by one of the best benefits-to-costs ratios in the treatment of dry eye sindrome...|$|R

This master thesis studies rheological behaviour of the polyesters of glycolic acid and lactic acid branched with tripentaerythritol and plasticized with triacetin. The theoretical part summarizes basic rheological facts, mentions main type of the viscometers and deals with {{importance of the}} rheological testing in the drug formulation. There are described properties and application of polyesters, polycarbophil and <b>carbomers</b> in the pharmaceutical technology. Plasticized polyesters with various concentrations of triacetin were prepared (20 %, 30 %, 40 %), their viscosity was measured by Brookfield viscometer at 37 and 50 řC. To compare, viscosity of the aqueous dispersion of polycarbophil, <b>carbomers</b> and acacia gum was measured too. Flow behaviour was evaluated by the viscosity curves.

50|$|Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA or <b>Carbomer)</b> is {{generic name}} for {{synthetic}} {{high molecular weight}} polymers of acrylic acid. They may be homopolymers of acrylic acid, crosslinked with an allyl ether pentaerythritol, allyl ether of sucrose or allyl ether of propylene. In a water solution at neutral pH, PAA is an anionic polymer, i.e. many of the side chains of PAA will lose their protons and acquire a negative charge. This makes PAAs polyelectrolytes, {{with the ability to}} absorb and retain water and swell to many times their original volume. Dry PAAs are found in the market as white and fluffy powders. <b>Carbomer</b> codes (910, 934, 940, 941 and 934P) are an indication of molecular weight and the specific components of the polymer. For many applications PAAs are used in form of alkali metal or ammonium salts, e.g. sodium polyacrylate.|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{conducted}} for Orion Corporation. The {{aim of this}} thesis was to examine, whether the viscosity of aqueous gels can be modelled from their Raman spectra with multivariate analysis. Previously the method's applicability for viscosity modelling of mineral oils and kerosene, for example, has been studied and the method's suitability for concentration modelling has been established. In a previous study done for Orion Corporation the suitability of the method for viscosity modelling of gels was discovered. The main objectives of this thesis were to confirm {{the results of the}} previous study and to discover the factors affecting the applicability of the method on different materials. Seven gelling agents used in pharmaceutical industry were examined: potato starch, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, two <b>carbomers,</b> polyvinylpyrrolidone and a blend containing polyacrylamide. Sample sets were prepared from the gelling agents and water and their viscosities were measured with a rotational rheometer. Four of the materials were suitable for Raman measurements with the selected instrumentation. The Raman spectra of hydroxypropylcellulose, the two <b>carbomers,</b> and polyvinylpyrrolidone, were recorded. Partial Least Squares regression (PLSR) models used for predicting viscosities of unknown samples were constructed based on the Raman spectra. The <b>carbomers</b> were well suitable for viscosity modelling, and their PLSR models predicted the viscosities of unknown samples accurately. The PLSR model of hydroxypropylcellulose resulted in great variation in the predicted viscosity values, and the model could not be considered reliable. A PLSR model could not be constructed from polyvinylpyrrolidone and therefore its viscosity values could not be predicted. It was confirmed in this study that the Raman spectroscopic method combined with multivariate analysis can be used for modelling of the viscosity of aqueous gels. No direct causal connection could be established between the material properties and modelling results, however. The most important factors affecting the applicability of the method were the appearance and concentrations of the gels samples. In the future, more comprehensive sample sets with lesser variation between the samples should be studied. More complex materials and the effect of measuring systems of Raman spectra and viscosity should be studied...|$|R

40|$|Mucoadhesion {{is where}} two surfaces, {{one of which}} is a mucous membrane, adhere to each other. This has been of {{interest}} in the pharmaceutical sciences in order to enhance localised drug delivery, or to deliver ‘difficult’ molecules (proteins and oligonucleotides) into the systemic circulation. Mucoadhesive materials are hydrophilic macromolecules containing numerous hydrogen bond forming groups, the <b>carbomers</b> and chitosans being two well-known examples. The mechanism by which mucoadhesion takes place has been said to have two stages, the contact (wetting) stage followed by the consolidation stage (the establishment of the adhesive interactions). The relative importance of each stage will depend on the individual application. For example, adsorption is a key stage if the dosage form cannot be applied directly to the mucosa of interest, while consolidation is important if the formulation is exposed to significant dislodging stresses. Adhesive joint failure will inevitably occur as a result of overhydration of a dosage form, or as a result of epithelia or mucus turnover. New mucoadhesive materials with optimal adhesive properties are now being developed, and these should enhance the potential applications of this technology...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{formulate}} an optimized gastric floating {{drug delivery}} system (GFDDS) containing glipizide with <b>carbomers</b> and cellulosic polymers. Method: Central composite design (CCD) was employed in formulating the GFDDS using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose K 4 M (HPMC K 4 M) (A) and Carbopol 934 P (CP 934 P) (B), as independent variables. Floating lag time (FLT), total floating time (TFT) and time required to release 50 % of the drug (T 50) were selected as dependent variables. The dissolution data obtained were fitted to various release models and the floating profiles of the formulations analyzed. Results: HPMC K 4 M loading clearly enhanced floating properties while CP 934 P showed negative effect on floating properties but was helpful in controlling drug release.

The mucoadhesive will stay in place until dislodged, which can arise from either overhydration of a dosage form, epithelial cell or mucus turnover, the application of force that overcomes the adhesive properties of the formulation or a combination of these.

40|$|Nanoemulsion {{is one of}} the {{alternative}} nano-lipid delivery systems of lipophilic active ingredients into the human skin in pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. Palm vitamin E extract is a natural lipophilic active that contains a-, β-,δ-, γ-tocotrienols and a-tocopherol. Palm vitamin E has the potency as an antioxidant for delaying the skin ageing process in cosmetic application, although the skin absorption of palm vitamin E in conventional formulations is considered low. The high lipophilicity of palm vitamin E isomers causes the limitation in the skin permeation. The skin penetration can be enhanced by the loading of palm vitamin E extract in an oil phase of a nanolipid-delivery system such as nanoemulsion. Therefore, the potency of nanoemulsion loaded with palm vitamin E extract was studied. Palm vitamin E extract was loaded in two nanoemulsions prepared by two different techniques and then incorporated into polymeric hydrogels. The skin absorption and pharmacokinetics of vitamin E isomers loaded in nanoemulsion hydrogels were investigated. Liquid chromatography assay method of a-, δ-, γ-tocotrienols and a-tocopherol in various samples of the different stages of this study was successfully validated and revalidated. Nanoemulsion formulations were developed firstly by the formation of lyotropic phase system as a pro-nanoemulsion (nanophase gel) by heat mixing, and secondly by using self nano-emulsifying technique by cold mixing. Two oils were used in the nanoemulsion formulation development; palm oil was formulated as a nanoemulsion by using hot mixing technique and, Nigella saliva oil nanoemulsion was prepared by using cold mixing of self emulsifying system. Palm oil nanoemulsion was formulated with the aid of design experiment as semisolid hydrogel by loading <b>carbomers</b> (Carbopol 934 and 940) and then characterized by the droplet size distribution to determine the best formulation for loading with palm vitamin E extract. The effect of <b>carbomers</b> incorporated in nanoemulsion formulations on the droplet size distribution, semisolid rheology and texture was determined by using expert design experiment to select a stable formulation for permeation studies. The in vitro vitamin E isomers permeation through the polycarbonate membrane was investigated using Franz diffusion cells. The vitamin E isomers permeation through polycarbonate membrane depended on the pore size of membrane and the concentration of Carbopol 940 in nanoemulsion hydrogel formulations. The different formulation of nanoemulsion formulation has not shown any affect on the permeation profiles of vitamin E isomers. Finally, the in vivo skin penetration of a-, δ-, γ-tocotrienols and atocopherol loaded in nanoemulsion hydrogel by topical application on the hairless rat abdominal skin was investigated. The accumulative amount of vitamin E isomers in rat skin epidermis and the bioavailability of vitamin E isomers measured in the rat plasma showed that nanoemulsion hydrogels with small droplets size provided high skin absorption. 8 -tocotrienol in the form of nanoemulsion hydrogel with mean droplet size of l 00 nm was preferably absorbed through the rat skin compared to γ-, octocotrienols and a-tocopherol...|$|R

The pH of the formulations was between 6. 3 - 7. 4. The formulations were examined in terms of appearance, taste, odor, spray-ability, short-term thermal and mechanical stability, pH, viscosity and rheological behavior, particle size distribution, as well as invitro mucoadhesive strength (MS). The mucoadhesivity ratio (MR) was also calculated as follows: MR=MStest/MScontrol, using natural saliva as the control. Natural saliva showed a pseudoplastic rheological behavior, with a viscosity in the range of 12. 85 - 28. 15 cP. Hence, artificial saliva samples having viscosities within this range were selected. The rheological behavior and viscosity of the test samples as well as the natural saliva were subsequently determined. Similar to that found for the natural saliva, all the prepared formulations showed a pseudoplastic rheological behavior. Among the polymers, C 974 p had the highest viscosity (25. 97 ± 0. 11 cPp) and mucoadhesive strength (34. 84 ± 0. 21 mN/cm 2) followed by hydroxypropylmethylcellulose which had a viscosity of 25. 48 ± 0. 11 cPp and a mucoadhesive strength of 34. 03 ± 0. 24 mN/cm 2. Furthermore, the mucoadhesivity of C 974 p containing artificial saliva was 1. 186 times greater than natural saliva and 1. 387 times more than water.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the clinical effect of <b>carbomer</b> eye gel combined with polyethylene glycol eye drops {{on the treatment}} of dry eye. METHODS: Totally 120 dry eye patients(240 eyes) were randomly divided into the observation group(n = 60 cases) and the control group(n = 60 cases). Two groups were given the polyethylene glycol eye drops. On the basis of this, the observation group were given the <b>carbomer</b> eye gel. The course of treatment was 1 mo. The levels of IL- 1 β and TNF-α, eye symptom score ocular surface disease index(OSDI), break-up time(BUT), Schirmer Ⅰ test(SⅠt), corneal fluorescein staining(FL), efficacy and adverse reactions in two groups were compared. RESULTS: After treatment, the levels of IL- 1 β and TNF-α, OSDI and FL in two groups were significantly lower than those before treatment and BUT and SⅠT {{were significantly higher than}} those before treatment, showing statistically significant differences(P P χ 2 = 5. 065, P = 0. 024). There were no ocular symptoms and drug intolerance in two groups. CONCLUSION: <b>Carbomer</b> eye gel combined with polyethylene glycol eye drops has obvious curative effect on dry eye, which is better than that treated by polyethylene glycol eye drops, and this combination does not increase the adverse reactions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Carbomers {{are widely}} used in {{products}} {{for the treatment of}} dry eye; however, the polymer gel thins on addition of probes (for example, fluorescein salt) confounding the comparison of products by objective clinical tests such as spectrophotofluorimetry or scintigraphy. A novel method of radiolabelling <b>carbomer</b> gels, with minimum change to their rheology, has permitted the non-invasive evaluation of precorneal residence of the gel in volunteers using gamma scintigraphy. The technique was used to evaluate the precorneal clearance of the liquid phase and of a suspended particulate in GelTears.  METHODS—Low sodium technetium- 99 m labelled diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (99 mTc-DTPA) was used to label <b>carbomer</b> 940  gel, either adsorbed onto sterile charcoal to model an entrapped drug, or added directly to the gel to a final activity of 1  MBq per 25  µl dose. The clearance of the labelled gels was then compared with 99 mTc-DTPA labelled saline in 12  volunteers.  RESULTS—The addition of the low sodium radiopharmaceutical produced insignificant rheological changes in the gel compared with conventional 99 mTc-DTPA labelling. The residence times on the eye of the gel formulations were significantly greater than that of the saline control. At 8  minutes postdosing, the label levels retained (mean (SD)) on the ocular surface were: saline, 7 % (7 %); 99 mTc-DTPA gel, 42 % (27 %); and 99 mTc-carbon gel, 42 % (20 %) of administered dose. There was no difference observed in the precorneal distribution between 99 mTc-DTPA solution and particulate markers.  CONCLUSIONS—These data demonstrate that <b>carbomer</b> based gels significantly extend contact of solutes or suspended solids with the corneal surface. The method of labelling does not significantly change the initial viscosity and is superior to previous methods which have used sodium salts (for example, sodium fluorescein) and therefore underestimate contact time.    Keywords: <b>carbomer</b> gels; viscosity; ocular contact time; dry eye syndrom...|$|E
40|$|Equine {{influenza}} vaccines containing inactivated whole virus and <b>Carbomer</b> adjuvant stimulated higher levels and longer lasting antibody to haemagglutinin in ponies than vaccines of equivalent antigenic content containing aluminium phosphate adjuvants. Five {{months after the}} third dose of vaccine containing <b>Carbomer</b> adjuvant, ponies were protected against clinical disease induced by an aerosol of virulent influenza virus (A/equine/Newmarket/ 79, H 3 N 8). In contrast ponies which received vaccine containing aluminium phosphate adjuvant were susceptible to infection and disease. There was an inverse correlation between prechallenge levels of antibody detected by single radial haemolysis (SRH) and duration of virus excretion, pyrexia and coughing. All ponies with antibody levels equivalent to SRH zones of > or = 154 mm 2 were protected against infection and all those with levels > or = 85 mm 2 were protected from disease...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{evaluate}} the shear bond {{strength of a}} new generation of glass ionomer (Glass <b>Carbomer)</b> to enamel versus a nano-filled resin-modified glass ionomer (ketac Nano) and a conventional type after different storage periods. Materials & methodsCrowns of 36 sound and freshly extracted human permanent molars were sectioned mesiodistally into two halves. The convex buccal or lingual surface was gently ground with water cooled 200 -, 400 -, and 600 -grit silicon carbide abrasive papers successively to obtain flat enamel surfaces. The prepared specimens (n =  72) were divided into three main groups (24 each) : I (Ionofil Molar), II (Ketac Nano) III (Glass <b>Carbomer).</b> The specimens in each group were subdivided into three subgroups A, B & C according to the storage period in artificial saliva. Shear bond strength between enamel surface and the bonded material was measured using a universal testing machine at a cross head speed of 0. 5  mm/min. All the debonded interfaces were examined under both binocular stereo microscope at 40 × and SEM at 200 × to determine the mode of failure. ResultsKetac Nano recorded the highest shear bond strength values (9. 30  ±  0. 67, 12. 07  ±  0. 76, 6. 7  ±  0. 73) followed by Ionofil Molar, recording (5. 25  ±  0. 62, 7. 82  ±  1. 42, 5. 91  ±  0. 87) while the lowest values were found in Glass <b>Carbomer</b> specimens, recording (2. 17  ±  0. 63, 6. 66  ±  0. 68, 5. 72  ±  0. 79). There was a highly significant difference in shear bond strength values among the three different storage periods in all the tested materials (P <  0. 0001). A positive correlation was recorded (R =  9. 3) between the adhesive mode of failure and shear bond strength while a negative correlation was recorded (R =  4. 5) between the cohesive mode of failure and shear bond strength using Spearman's correlation test. ConclusionsStorage time was a factor which significantly influenced both shear bond strength and mode of failure especially in Glass <b>Carbomer</b> specimens...|$|E
