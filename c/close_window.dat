40|$|This {{experimental}} {{model was}} designed to assess the mouse pial microcirculation during acute and chronic, physiological and pathophysiological hemodynamic, inflammatory and metabolic conditions, using in vivo fluorescence microscopy. A closed cranial window is placed over the left parieto-occipital cortex of the mice. Local microcirculation is recorded in real time through the window using epi and fluorescence illumination, and measurements of vessels diameters and red blood cell (RBC) velocities are performed. RBC velocity is measured using real-time cross-correlation and/or fluorescent-labeled erythrocytes. Leukocyte and platelet adherence to pial vessels and assessment of perfusion and vascular leakage are made {{with the help of}} fluorescence-labeled markers such as Albumin-FITC and anti-CD 45 -TxR antibodies. Microcirculation can be repeatedly video-recorded over several days.

40|$|Lighting {{accounts}} for about 20 % of total electrical energy consumption in the United States. Using natural lighting is a cost-effective way to reduce this consumption and, at the same time, {{enhance the quality of}} the indoor environment. For several years, architects and engineers have used scale models, hand calculator programs, and sophisticated main-frame computer programs (such as LUMEN-II) to determine levels of interior daylight for different building configurations. However, none of these tools determines the annual energy savings from daylighting, information which could have an important effect on design decisions. For this reason, a daylighting simulation has been added to DOE- 2. Taken into account are such factors as window size, glass transmittance, inside surface reflectances of the space, sun-control devices such as blinds and overhangs, and the luminance distribution of the sky. Because this distribution depends on the position of the sun and the cloudiness of the sky, the calculation is made for standard clear- and overcast-sky conditions and for a series of 20 solar altitude and azimuth values covering the annual range of sun positions. The calculations are performed prior to the complete simulation, and the the resulting daylight factors are stored for later use. Analogous factors for glare are also calculated and stored. For the hourly envelope simulation, the illuminance from each window is found by interpolating the stored daylight factors (using the current-hour sun-position and cloud cover), then multiplying by the current-hour exterior horizontal illuminance. If the glare-control option has been specified, the program will automatically <b>close</b> <b>window</b> blinds or drapes to decrease glare below a pre-defined comfort level. Adding the illuminance contributions from all the windows gives the total number of footcandles at each reference point.

40|$|When {{we observe}} other people's actions, {{a network of}} temporal, parietal and frontal regions is recruited, known as action {{observation}} network (AON). This network includes areas that {{have been reported to}} be involved when we perform actions ourselves. Such findings support the view that action understanding occurs by simulating actions in our own motor system (motor theories of action understanding). Alternatively, {{it has been argued that}} actions are understood based on a perceptual analysis, with access to action knowledge stored in the conceptual system (cognitive theories of action understanding). It has been argued earlier that areas that play a crucial role for action understanding should be able to (a) distinguish between different actions, and (b) generalize across the ways in which the action is performed (e. g. Dinstein, Thomas, Behrmann, & Heeger, 2008; Oosterhof, Tipper, & Downing, 2013; Caramazza, Anzelotti, Strnad, & Lingnau, 2014). Here we argue that one additional criterion needs to be met: an area that plays a crucial role for action understanding should have access to such abstract action information early, around the time when the action is recognized. An area that has access to abstract action information after the action has been recognized is unlikely to contribute to the process of action understanding. In this thesis, I report three neuroimaging studies in which we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize the temporal dynamics of abstract representations of observed actions (Study 1 and 2), meaning that generalize across lower level dimensions, and to characterize the type of information encoded in the regions of the AON (Study 3). Specifically, in Study 1 we examined where in the brain and at which point in time it is possible to distinguish between pointing and grasping actions irrespective of the way in which they are performed (reach direction, effector) using MEG in combination with multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and source analysis. We show that regions in the left lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) have the earliest access to abstract action representations. By contrast, precentral regions, though recruited relatively early, have access to abstract action representations substantially later than left LOTC. In Study 2, we tested the temporal dynamics of the neural decoding related to the oscillatory activity induced by observation of actions performed with different effectors (hand, foot). We observed that temporal regions are able to discriminate all the presented actions before effector-related decoding within effector-specific motor regions. Finally, in Study 3 we investigated what aspect of an action is encoded within the regions of the AON. Object-directed actions induce a change of states, e. g. opening a bottle means changing its state from closed to open. It is still unclear how and in which brain regions these neural representations are encoded. Using fMRI-based multivoxel pattern decoding, we aimed at dissociating the neural representations of states and action functions. Participants observed stills of objects (e. g., window blinds) that were in either open or closed states, and videos of actions involving the same objects, i. e., open or <b>close</b> <b>window.</b> Action videos could show the object manipulation only (invisible change), or the complete action scene (visible change). This design allowed us to detect neural representations of action scenes, states and action functions independently of each other. We found different sub-regions within LOTC containing information related to object states, action functions, or both. These findings provide important information regarding the organization of action semantics in the brain and the role of LOTC in action understanding. ...|$|E

40|$|Chapter 1 : Kinematics of Motorcycles The {{kinematic}} {{study of}} motorcycles is important, especially {{in relation to}} its effects on the dynamic behavior of motorcycles. Therefore, in this chapter, {{in addition to the}} kinematic study, some simple examples of the dynamics behavior of motorcycles are reported in order to show how kinematic peculiarities influence the directional stability and maneuverability of motorcycles. Chapter 2 : Motorcycle Tires The tire is one of the motorcycle's most important components. Its fundamental characteristic is its deformability, which allows contact between the wheel and the road to be maintained even when small obstacles are found. In addition to improving the comfort of the ride, the tire improves adherence, an important characteristic both for the transfer to the ground of large driving and braking forces, and for the generation of lateral forces. The performance of a motorcycle is a largely influenced by the characteristics of its tires. in order to understand their importance, one must consider that control of the vehicle's equilibrium and motion occurs through the generation of longitudinal and lateral forces that correspond with the contact patches of the tires with the road plane. The forces originate as a result of action taken by the rider through the steering mechanism, the accelerator and the braking system. <b>close</b> <b>window</b> Chapter 3 : Rectilinear Motion of Motorcycles The behavior of motorcycles during rectilinear motion depends on the longitudinal forces exchanged between the tires and the road, the aerodynamic forces originating during this motion, and the slope of the road plane. The study of rectilinear motion highlights certain dynamic aspects that are also important for safety, such as the motorcycle's behavior during braking with a possible forward overturning, and in acceleration, with possible wheeling. Chapter 4 : Steady Turning During steady turning motion the motorcycle can have neutral, under or oversteering behavior. To maintain equilibrium the rider applies a torque to the handlebars that can be zero, positive, in the same direction of the handlebar rotation, or negative, i. e., applied in the direction opposite to the rotation of the handlebar. These characteristics are important and concur to define the sensation of the motorcycle's handling. Chapter 5 : In-Plane Dynamics A motorcycle without suspension moving over irregular ground presents difficulties in steering because of the loss of wheel grip on the road plane, and because of rider discomfort. Small bumps on the ground are easily absorbed by the tires, but for adequate absorption of larger bumps, the motorcycle needs appropriate suspension. A motorcycle with suspension, from a dynamics point of view, can be considered as a rigid body connected to the wheels with elastic systems (front and rear suspension). The rigid body constitutes the sprung mass (chassis, engine, steering head, rider), while the masses attached to the wheels are called unsprung masses. Suspension had to satisfy the following three purposes: * to allow the wheels to follow the profile of the road without transmitting excessive vibration to the rider. This purpose concerns rider comfort, that is the isolation of the sprung mass from the vibration generated by the interaction of the wheels with road irregularities; * to ensure wheel grip on the road plane in order to transmit the required driving and braking forces; * to ensure the desired trim of the vehicle under various operating conditions (accelerated motion, braking, entering and leaving turns). The degree of required comfort varies according {{to the use of the}} vehicle. For example, in racing vehicles, comfort is less important than the motorcycle's capacity to keep the wheels in contact with the ground and to assume the desired trim. However, in other vehicles the suspension is expected to serve other purposes. For example, in cross-country vehicles the suspension serves to isolate the sprung mass from continuous impact generated by the vehicle jumps. For this reason, suspension in cross-country vehicles has greater wheel travel than in touring vehicles, and more so than in racing vehicles. As to the trim, it much be stressed that it depends on the stiffness of the suspension. The load can be quite variable in motorcycles (one or two passengers, possibly with baggage); and further, load transfer between the front and rear wheel occurs in both acceleration and braking. Chapter 6 : Motorcycle Trim In the previous chapters, the forces operating on the motorcycle were calculated: resistant forces, driving force and dynamic loads on the wheels, in different conditions of both stationary and non stationary motion, in acceleration and in braking. In this chapter, variations in the trim taken by the motorcycle in various driving conditions will be studied instead, and the importance covered by the chain force will be highlighted. The term vehicle trim implies the geometric configuration that the motorcycle takes in different conditions in steady-unsteady motions, in acceleration and in braking. As shown below, the motorcycle's trim depends on the stiffness characteristics of the front and rear wheel suspension, on the forces operating on the motorcycle, and on the inclination angle of the chain and the swinging arm.   Chapter 7 : Motorcycle Vibration Modes and Stability As everyone knows, the front and/or rear end of a motorcycle in motion can start to oscillate around the steering axis, especially if the wheels are unbalanced. This phenomenon is easy to observe experimentally, for example by gradually slowing down the motorcycle from a fairly high speed. Oscillations can be observed at certain speed if the front wheel is, statically or dynamically, out of balance. They reach their maximum amplitude and then decrease as speed decreases until they disappear completely. Rear-end oscillations can be observed when traveling over a transversal bump or by exciting the rear frame with an impulsive movement of the trunk. Front end oscillations exhibit their greatest amplitude at a higher speed than rear-end oscillations do. At a low speed it can also be easily observed that the motorcycle tends to fall over sideways, regardless of what the rider does. These experimental observations of motorcycle dynamics who that there are three major modes: * capsize, a non oscillation mode used and controlled by the rider; * weave, an oscillation of the entire motorcycle, but mainly the rear end; * wobble, an oscillation of the front end around the steering axis which does not involve the rear end in any significant way. In this chapter, firstly we will study these modes using simplified models and later on the in-plane and out of plane modes will be studies by means of an eleven degree of freedom models. Chapter 8 : Motorcycles Maneuverability and Handling A motorcycle's dynamic properties are described using terms like maneuverability, handling and stability. Maneuverability and handling describe the motorcycle's ability to execute complicated maneuvers, and how difficult it is for the rider to perform them. Stability, on the other hand, means a motorcycle's ability to maintain equilibrium in response to outside disturbances like an uneven road surface or gusts of wind...|$|E
