40|$|Two-dimensional {{electron}} gases {{with strong}} spin-orbit <b>coupling</b> <b>covered</b> by a superconducting layer offer a flexible and potentially scalable platform for Majorana networks. We predict Majorana bound states (MBSs) to appear for experimentally achievable parameters and realistic gate potentials in two designs: either underneath a narrow stripe of a superconducting layer (S-stripes) or where a narrow stripe {{has been removed}} from a uniform layer (N-stripes). The coupling of the MBSs can be tuned for both types in a wide range (10 μeV) using gates placed adjacent to the stripes. For both types, we numerically compute the local density of states for two parallel Majorana-stripe ends as well as Majorana trijunctions formed in a tuning-fork geometry. The MBS coupling between parallel Majorana stripes can be suppressed below 1 neV for potential barriers in the meV range for separations of about 200 nm. We further show that the MBS couplings in a trijunction can be gate-controlled in a range similar to the intra-stripe coupling while maintaining a sizable gap to the excited states (tens of μeV). Altogether, this suggests that braiding can carried out on a time scale of 10 - 100 ns...|$|R

2500|$|HMBC detects heteronuclear {{correlations}} over longer {{ranges of}} about 24 bonds. [...] The difficulty of detecting multiple-bond correlations {{is that the}} HSQC and HMQC sequences contain a specific delay time between pulses which allows detection only of a range around a specific coupling constant. [...] This {{is not a problem}} for the single-bond methods since the coupling constants tend to lie in a narrow range, but multiple-bond <b>coupling</b> constants <b>cover</b> a much wider range and cannot all be captured in a single HSQC or HMQC experiment.|$|R
