40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{designed to}} measure the concentrations of submicron <b>contact</b> <b>ice</b> nuclei is described. Here, natural forces transfer nuclei to supercooled sample drops suspended in an aerosol stream.

A figure is included showing the ice nucleus concentrations as a function of temperature and assumed aerosol radius. For a 0. 01 micron radius, the average is 1 /liter at - 15 C and 3 /liter at - 18 C.

A one-dimensional numerical model simulation indicated that precipitation particle temperatures were sensitive to environmental temperature and relative humidity {{and close to the}} wet-bulb temperature. The simulation demonstrated that completely melted snowflakes could refreeze by evaporative cooling. Moreover, initial freezing could be explained by <b>contact</b> <b>ice</b> nucleation {{at the height of the}} minimum wet-bulb temperature. Observations using a 2 D video distrometer (2 DVD) indicated that ice pellets exhibited two modes of fall velocities at surface temperatures near 0 degrees C during the same time period: slow falling and fast falling. The slow-falling ice pellets exhibited a velocity similar to the average terminal velocity of hail, whereas the velocities of the fast-falling ice pellets were closer to those of raindrops. Surface roundness and fracturing characteristics of ice pellets suggest that slow-falling ice pellets froze rapidly and uniformly in a relatively cold dry layer with a wet-bulb temperature near - 4 degrees C. In contrast, the fast-falling ice pellets exhibited the properties of ice particles with a wet smooth surface, suggesting that they froze slowly in a relatively warm layer by <b>contacting</b> <b>ice</b> crystals or splinters generated by preceding slow-falling ice pellets...|$|R

Friction coefficients were extraordinarily low and were proportional to {{the ratio of the}} tangential sliding rate and the normal crushing rate.

40|$|Once meltwater {{reaches the}} base of a snowpack it can {{infiltrate}} the underlying stratum, runoff, or refreeze and form a basal ice layer. Basal ice formation is most common early in melt over saturated or very cold frozen soils. Meltwater becomes enriched in ion concentrations compared to the parent snow due to ion fractionation during thaw and percolation through the snowpack. If ion exclusion occurs during basal ice formation, further enrichment of runoff water ion concentrations can occur. The influence of basal ice formation on runoff water chemistry was examined by comparing ion concentrations in runoff water that had sustained basal <b>ice</b> <b>contact,</b> to meltwater before basal <b>ice</b> <b>contact.</b> A series of experiments, involving melting a snowpack in a large insulated box over a cold impermeable substrate in a temperature-controlled room, were carried out. A cooling system at the chemically inert base ensured frozen conditions during snowmelt. Meltwater samples were collected throughout melt from within the snowpack using an extraction tube, and runoff water was collected at the base. All samples were analyzed for major anions and cations. Results showed that formation of basal ice layers enriched the runoff water compared to meltwater before basal <b>ice</b> <b>contact.</b> Ion concentrations in basal <b>ice</b> <b>contact</b> runoff water were up to sixteen times greater than those in no-contact meltwater; however, on average, basal <b>ice</b> <b>contact</b> runoff water showed 1. 5 times the ion concentrations of the no-contact meltwater. The implications are that basal ice formation will act to strongly alter both meltwater ion pathway and concentration. When no basal ice is present, enhanced infiltration of meltwater ion load can cause relatively dilute runoff water. When basal ice is present all meltwater runs off and further ion concentration enrichment occurs...|$|R

40|$|Ice {{load and}} {{pressure}} data from the 1994 CCGS Louis St-Laurent trip through the Arctic were reanalyzed using a different method than {{was used for the}} original report. The impact events that were chosen for re-analysis spanned a variety of ship speeds, ice thicknesses and concentrations. For any given impact event all sub-panel segments (cells) of the strain-gauged hull panel for which a signal registered above the deemed noise level were considered to be subjected to ice load. Consequently all of the <b>ice</b> <b>contact</b> area, and associated ice load, was taken into account regardless of whether the <b>ice</b> <b>contact</b> consisted of a single area or multiple non-contiguous areas on the impacted panel. The data from a total of 51 randomly selected events covering a range of <b>ice</b> <b>contact</b> areas from 1. 4 m 2 to 16. 8 m 2 were initially analyzed to yield {{load and pressure}} distribution at the time of peak load for each event. Then further analysis was conducted to identify well-behaved events where the loaded areas were more contained on the panel and less concentrated at its edges. The effects of using this selection strategy are shown. For the data from the well-behaved events the pressure-area relationship was essentially flat with an average value 0. 49 MPa over the stated range of contact area. Another set of 12 impact events were also analyzed, for which the full time-series of pressure on each of the 30 cells that comprise the panel were available from the original reduction of data. An analysis of load and contact area from these events demonstrated the effect of having oversized cells on ice impact panels, that leads to overestimates of <b>ice</b> <b>contact</b> area and underestimates of average pressure. The analysis suggested that the best estimates of actual <b>ice</b> <b>contact</b> area and average pressure, though still not fully accurate, are obtained when the contact area is the greatest, i. e. usually at peak load.
