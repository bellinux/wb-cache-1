5000|$|In digital typography, kerning {{is usually}} applied to letter pairs {{as a number}} by which the default <b>character</b> <b>spacing</b> should be {{increased}} or decreased: a positive value for an increase, a negative value for a decrease. The number is expressed in font units, one unit being a certain fraction of an em (one em is the type size currently used). Different fonts may use different units, but common values are 1000 and 2048 units/em. Thus, for 1000 units/em, a kerning value of 15 means an increase in <b>character</b> <b>spacing</b> by 0.015 of the current type size.

PS for Hebrew, however, is asymmetric towards left as it is read right to left. In the present study we examined asymmetry in PS for a group of Indian students reading English. Using a moving window paradigm, we found that the extent of asymmetry was four <b>character</b> <b>spaces</b> to the left of fixation as has been reported for native readers of English. Thus, the study supports the view that PS for reading a language does not vary across cultures. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this note}} we {{construct}} Swiss cheeses X such that R(X) is non-regular but such that R(X) has no non-trivial Jensen measures. We also construct a non-regular uniform algebra with compact, metrizable <b>character</b> <b>space</b> such that every {{point of the}} <b>character</b> <b>space</b> is a peak point. In [Co] Cole gave a counterexample to the peak point conjecture by constructing a non-trivial uniform algebra A with compact, metrizable <b>character</b> <b>space</b> ΦA such that every point of ΦA is a peak point for A. This uniform algebra was obtained from an example of McKissick [M] by a process of repeatedly adjoining square roots. Because McKissick’s algebra is regular, so is this first example constructed by Cole (see [F 2] and [Ka]). This leads to the following question: Let A be a uniform algebra with compact, metrizable <b>character</b> <b>space</b> ΦA such that every point of ΦA is a peak point for A. Must A be regular? In this note we construct {{an example of a}} Swiss cheese X for which the uniform algebra R(X) is non-regular, but such that R(X) has no non-trivial Jensen measures. We then apply Cole’s construction to this example to produce an example of a non-regular uniform algebra with compact, metrizable <b>character</b> <b>space</b> such that every point of the <b>character</b> <b>space</b> is a peak point. We begin by recalling some standard facts about Jensen measures. Notation For a commutative Banach algebra A, we denote by ΦA the <b>character</b> <b>space</b> of A. Now suppose that A is a uniform algebra on a compact space X. For x ∈ X, let Mx and Jx be the ideals of functions in A vanishing at x, and in a neighbourhood of x, respectively. Definition 1 Let A be a uniform algebra on a compact space X, and let φ ∈ ΦA. Then a Jensen measure for φ is a regular, Borel probability measure µ on X such that, for all f ∈ A, log |φ(f) | ≤ log |f(x) |dµ(x) (where log(0) is defined to be −∞). X Let x ∈ X. We say that x is a point of continuity for A if there is no point y of X {x satisfying Mx ⊇ Jy. It is standard (see, for example, [G, p. 33]) that every φ ∈ ΦA has a Jensen measure supported on X, and that each such measure represents φ, i. e., for all f ∈ A, φ(f) ...|$|R

This research focused on character recognition by developing a system capable to recognise images of printed Balinese traditional character, which has a distinct feature of having perceptually similar characters, where each others are often differentiated only by a small stroke or a curve. The system itself took several processes to recognise a character. First, the image containing Balinese characters is preprocessed. Afterwards, two object features are extracted from the image: Direction and Binary Object Area. Both features then tested for similarity using Euclidean distance with the same features already obtained from the control images. From 573 characters tested to the system, 559 are recognized as characters and 526 are correctly recognized as the right character, which yields an overall accuracy of 91. 8 %.

40|$|This {{creative}} project investigates {{a method}} for translating a run-length encoded data file of letterforms into bit mapped images. Each letterform is broken (cracked) into primitive strokes. Each primitive stroke is represented by equally spaced runlength spline points within a 72 unit counting system. The strokes are ordered from left to right, allowing a direct scan-line conversion using an on-off character fill. Most commercial letterforms are stored in an outline format. Outline letterfomrs must be converted to vector edges, and then quick sorted into two dimensional arrays of edges for scan-line conversion (no overlapping outlines are allowed). The author's method stores primitives in a left to right ordered format that eliminates the sorting routine. In order to display the letterforms as a body of text, an interpreted description language was developed. The language command structure {{is embedded in the}} text file and interpreted at run time. The language controlls the sizing and placement of letterforms at five levels. The page attributes controlls the placement of page margins, column margins, windows, headers, footers, etc. The Paragraph attributes controlles first word indents, paragraph indents, widow lines, etc. The line attributes controlles the text line length, inter word and <b>character</b> <b>spacing,</b> line leading, additional line indents, type of line justification and hyphenation, etc. No attributes were established at the word level.

40|$|We give {{a survey}} of the known {{connections}} between regularity conditions and amenability conditions in the setting of uniform algebras. For a uniform algebra $A$ we consider the set, $A_{lc}$, of functions in $A$ which are locally constant on a (varying) dense open subset of the <b>character</b> <b>space</b> of $A$. We show that, for a separable uniform algebra $A$, if $A$ has bounded relative units at every point of a dense subset of the <b>character</b> <b>space</b> of $A$, then $A_{lc}$ is dense in $A$. We construct a separable, essential, regular uniform algebra $A$ on its <b>character</b> <b>space</b> $X$ such that every point of $X$ is a peak point for $A$, $A$ has bounded relative units at every point of a dense open subset of $X$ and yet $A$ is not weakly amenable.

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the effects of visual {{impairment}} on reading. We used psychophysical methods to study reading by 16 low-vision observers. Reading rates were measured for text scanned across the face of a TV monitor while varying parameters that are likely to be important in low vision: angular character size, number of characters in the field, number of dots composing each character, contrast polarity (white-on-black vs black-on-white text), and <b>character</b> <b>spacing.</b> Despite diverse pathologies and degrees of vision loss in our sample, several major generalizations emerged. There is a wide variation in peak reading rates among low-vision observers, but 64 % of the variance can be accounted for by two major distinctions: intact central fields vs central-field loss and cloudy vs clear ocular media. Peak reading rates for observers with central-field loss were very low (median 25 words/minute), while peak reading rates for observers with intact central fields were at least 90 words/minute (median 130 words/minute). Most low-vision readers require magnification to obtain characters of optimal size. Sloan M acuity was a better predictor of optimal character size than Snellen acuity, accounting for 72 % of the variance. Low-vision reading is similar to normal reading in several respects. For example, both show the same dependence on the number of characters in the field. Our results provide estimates of the best reading performance to be expected from low-vision observers with characteristic forms of vision loss, and the stimulus parameters necessary for optimal performance. These results will be useful in the development of clinical tests of low vision, and in the design of low-vision reading aids...|$|E
40|$|Kommunikation via text har en stor roll i IT-åldern; SMS, mail och sociala medier är bara några exempel på nya kommunikationsformer. All textbaserad kommunikation lider dock av en gemensam svaghet, att det är svårt att förmedla icke-verbala {{signaler}} med ord. Ingen teknik för att förmedla sådana signaler grafiskt i text har slagit igenom på bred front. I denna uppsats föreslås uttrycksfull typografi, som en lösning på problemet. Uttrycksfull typografi betecknar här textpresentation med variation av typsnitt, storlek, teckenavstånd, deformeringar, rörelse, färg, piktogram. Denna nya teknik testades på personer som fick läsa texter i form av Facebookinlägg med ambivalent känslomässigt innehåll. Tolv texter formaterades med uttrycksfull typografi som skulle förtydliga meddelandet och jämfördes med samma tolv texter utan den uttrycksfulla typografin. Resultatet visade att majoriteten av formateringarna förmedlade icke-verbala uttryck betydligt bättre än de oformaterade texterna. Uttrycksfull typografi bedöms ha stor potential att förbättra redan existerande medier. Communication through text has {{an important}} role in the information age. SMS, email, and social media are but a few examples of new forms of communication. All text-based communication suffers from the difficulty of expressing non-verbal cues using words.

The phrase expressive typography is used to denote a presentation method of text with variation of font, size, <b>character</b> <b>spacing,</b> deformation, movement, colour and pictograms. This new technology was tested on people who were asked to read ambiguous texts in the form of Facebook posts. Twelve texts were formatted with expressive typography meant to clarify the intended message. Their results were compared to the same twelve texts without any expressive typography. The results showed that a majority of the formated texts were notably more effective at expressing non-verbal cues than their unformatted counterparts. Expressive typography is deemed to have great potential as an enhancement for already existing forms of media...|$|E

Evolutionary biologists debate {{the impact of}} external restrictions imposed by ecology, and intrinsic constraints imposed by development and genetics, on {{the rate at which}} morphological innovations are gained. These issues are particularly interesting for groups such as tetrapods, which evolved novel body plans relative to their piscine ancestors and which also invaded new ecosystems following terrestrialization. Prior studies have addressed these issues by looking at either ranges of morphological variation or rates of character change. Here, we address a related but distinct issue: the numbers of characters that freely vary within a clade. We modify techniques similar to those used by ecologists to infer species richnesses to estimate the number of potentially varying characters given the distributions of changes implied by a model phylogeny. Our results suggest both increasing constraints/restrictions and episodes of ‘character release’ (i. e. increasing the number of potentially varying characters). In particular, we show that stem lissamphibians had a restricted <b>character</b> <b>space</b> relative to that of stem amniotes, and that stem amniotes both had restrictions on some parts of <b>character</b> <b>space</b> but also invaded new <b>character</b> <b>space</b> that had been unavailable to stem tetrapods...|$|R
