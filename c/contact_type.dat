50|$|By definition, a level set of <b>contact</b> <b>type</b> admits {{a contact}} form {{obtained}} by contracting the Hamiltonian vector field into the symplectic form. In this case, the Hamiltonian flow is a Reeb vector field {{on that level}} set. It {{is a fact that}} any contact manifold (M,α) can be embedded into a canonical symplectic manifold, called the symplectization of M, such that M is a <b>contact</b> <b>type</b> level set (of a canonically defined Hamiltonian) and the Reeb vector field is a Hamiltonian flow. That is, any contact manifold can be made to satisfy the requirements of the Weinstein conjecture. Since, as is trivial to show, any orbit of a Hamiltonian flow is contained in a level set, the Weinstein conjecture is a statement about contact manifolds.|$|E

In this cross-sectional study, we explored the direct and indirect <b>contact</b> <b>types</b> and frequencies that exist between cattle farms within a region, focusing on potential routes of pathogen transmission. The owners/managers of 56 farms located in a 10 km by 10 km study area in north-west England were administered an interview-based questionnaire between June and September 2005. Information was obtained relating to <b>contact</b> <b>types</b> and frequencies, including those involving animal movements, equipment sharing between farms and any contractors or companies visiting the farms. The data was explored using hierarchical cluster analysis and network analysis. There was considerable variation between farms arising from different <b>contact</b> <b>types.</b> Some networks exhibited great connectivity, incorporating approximately 90...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of a granular sample {{can depend on}} the way the packing was prepared. However, the variables which store this information are often unknown. Here we present an X-ray tomography study of tetrahedra packings prepared with three different tapping strengths. Our main result is that the relative contribution of the three different <b>contact</b> <b>types</b> possible between tetrahedra [...] face-to-face (F 2 F), edge-to-face (E 2 F), and point contacts [...] is one variable which stores the preparation history. We show this by preparing pairs of packings that differ either in their bulk volume fraction ϕ_global or in their number of mechanical constraints per particle C, where C is determined from all three <b>contact</b> <b>types</b> which each fix a different amount of constraints. For the pairs with the same ϕ_global the number of E 2 F and point contacts varies with preparation, while the number of F 2 F contacts stays constant. For the iso-constraint packings the relative contribution of all three <b>contact</b> <b>types</b> stays the same. We then perform a local analysis of the contact distribution by grouping the particles together according to their individual volume fraction ϕ_local computed from a Voronoi tessellation. We find that the probability distribution of ϕ_local depends only on ϕ_global, not on C. The number of F 2 F and E 2 F contacts increases in all experiments with ϕ_local; the number of point contacts, while always being the largest, decreases with ϕ_local. However, only the number of F 2 F contacts can be described by an universal function of ϕ_local. This behavior differs from spheres and ellipsoids and posses a significant constraint for any mean-field approach to tetrahedra packings. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

5000|$|The {{conjecture}} was {{formulated in}} 1978 by Alan Weinstein. [...] In several cases, {{the existence of}} a periodic orbit was known. For instance, Rabinowitz showed that on star-shaped level sets of a Hamiltonian function on a symplectic manifold, there were always periodic orbits (Weinstein independently proved the special case of convex level sets). [...] Weinstein observed that the hypotheses of several such existence theorems could be subsumed in the condition that the level set be of <b>contact</b> <b>type.</b> (Weinstein's original conjecture included the condition that the first de Rham cohomology group of the level set is trivial; this hypothesis turned out to be unnecessary).|$|E
5000|$|The diagram (right) shows one of {{the most}} common single tube reflex {{circuits}} from the early 1920s. It functioned as a TRF receiver with one stage of RF and one stage of audio amplification. The radio frequency (RF) signal from the antenna passes through the bandpass filter C1, L1, L2, C2 and is applied to the grid of the directly heated triode, V1. The capacitor C6 bypasses the RF signal around the audio transformer winding T2 which would block it. The amplified signal from the plate of the tube is applied to the RF transformer L3, L4 while C3 bypasses the RF signal around the headphone coils. The tuned secondary L4, C5 which is tuned to the input frequency, serves as a second bandpass filter as well as blocking the audio signal in the plate circuit from getting to the detector. Its output is rectified by semiconductor diode D, which was a carborundum point <b>contact</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
50|$|Non <b>contact</b> <b>type</b> TPS {{work on the}} {{principle}} of Hall effect or Inductive sensors, or magnetoresistive technologies, wherein generally the magnet or inductive loop is the dynamic part which is mounted on the butterfly valve throttle spindle/shaft gear and the sensor & signal processing circuit board is mounted within the ETC gear box cover and is stationary. When the magnet/inductive loop mounted on the spindle which is rotated from the lower mechanical stop to WOT, there is a change in the magnetic field for the sensor. The change in the magnetic field is sensed by the sensor and the voltage generated is given as the input to the ECU. Normally a two pole rare earth magnet is used for the TPS due to their high Curie temperatures required in the under-hood vehicle environment. The magnet may be of diametrical type, ring type, rectangular or segment type. The magnet is defined to have a certain magnetic field that does not vary significantly with time or temperature.In case of failure of the TPS operation the CHECK ENGINE light remains illuminated even if there is no problem or error in the ECU. It cannot be corrected by clearing ECU errors by running diagnostic software. In order to rectify the malfunction the TPS needs {{to be replaced by a}} new one.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} how cancer patients in Norway use primary care out-of-hours (OOH) services and describe different <b>contact</b> <b>types</b> and procedures. Design: A retrospective cross-sectional registry study using a billing registry data source. Setting: Norwegian primary care OOH services in 2014. Subjects: All patients’ contacts in OOH services in 2014. Cancer patients {{were identified by}} ICPC- 2 diagnosis. Main outcome measures: Frequency of cancer patients’ contacts with OOH services, <b>contact</b> <b>types,</b> diagnoses, procedures, and socio-demographic characteristics. Results: In total, 5752 cancer patients had 20, 220 contacts (1 % of all) in OOH services. Half of the contacts were cancer related. Cancer in the digestive (22. 9 %) and respiratory (18. 0 %) systems were most frequent; and infection/fever (21. 8 %) and pain (13. 6 %) most frequent additional diagnoses. A total of 4170 patients {{had at least one}} cancer-related direct contact; of these, 64. 5 % had only one contact during the year. Cancer patients had more home visits and more physicians’ contact with municipal nursing services than other patients, but fewer consultations (p <  0. 001). Patients in the least central municipalities had significantly more contacts than more central municipalities (p <  0. 001). Conclusion: There was no indication of overuse of OOH services by cancer patients in Norway, which could indicate good quality of cancer care in general. </p...|$|R
