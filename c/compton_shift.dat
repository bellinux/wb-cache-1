40|$|The {{present report}} is a {{continuation}} of the work reported previously. The main purpose of the research is to test the correctness of the assumption that the initial velocities of electrons in the scattering body cause the observed breadth of the <b>Compton</b> <b>shifted</b> line. In the previous paper the natural breadths of the Compton line were observed for different angles of scattering and the breadth was found to obey the functional dependence on scattering angle predicted by DuMond on the assumption that electron velocities cause the breadth. According to DuMond's theory the breadth should also be nearly proportional to the primary wave-length. This point is tested in the present paper. Exposures of about one thousand hours each were made with characteristic K radiation from molybdenum, silver and tungsten target tubes. In each case the radiation was scattered from a graphite scatterer at a very well defined large scattering angle of 156 °, the multicrystal spectrograph being used to analyze the scattered radiation. Reproductions of the photographic spectrograms are shown and also microphotometer curves of the spectra. The breadth of the Compton line is found to diminish with shorter primary wave-lengths in complete accord with the predictions of DuMond's theory. Unless some other cause can be found to explain the observed behavior of the breadth the results of this paper and the above mentioned previous paper constitute a complete vindication of this theory and of its basic assumption that the initial velocities of the electrons in the scatterer cause the breadth of the <b>Compton</b> <b>shifted</b> line. If this is correct, then these experiments constitute direct experimental evidence of the dynamic nature of atoms. The <b>Compton</b> <b>shifted</b> line can indeed be thought of as broadened by the Doppler effect of the motion of the scattering electrons. A simplified form of the theory of modified scattering by initially moving electrons is presented to supplement and clarify the more elaborate and exact theory of the previous paper. We call {{attention to the fact that}} the theory and experimental results are in no way discordant with wave mechanics or the uncertainty principle but we believe that to translate the present exposition into the language of wave mechanics would tend to obscure rather than clarify the picture. The results of this work are so clearly defined that the reality of the much narrower Compton lines obtained recently by several investigators seems, in our opinion, to be very doubtful...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Traditional {{textbook}} {{explanations of}} the Compton effect treat the photon electron interaction as a particle collision. This explanation is a pedagogical disaster, implying that sometimes interactions are particle-like whereas quantum mechanics always demands that they be wave-like; a photon wavefunction evolves according to a wave equation until its collapse at measurement. If this is so why then does the classical radiation wave equation fail to predict the Compton effect? We address these issues and propose a clearer explanation. Traditional quantum mechanics textbook present the Compton effect as proof that the photon is a particle that carries momentum. The correct value of the <b>Compton</b> <b>shift</b> to longer wavelength is derived by applying relativistic two-body kinematics with the photon and electron treated as particles. This traditional explanation states wavelenght shift occurs from ”individual photons scattering elastically off individual electrons ” [2].

40|$|Abstract. 2014 ECOSS (Electron Compton Scattering on Solids) is a {{powerful}} method {{in order to obtain}} the momentum density distribution of conduction electrons. Apart from the Bragg-Compton channel coupling which produces a strong and often irregular background, the main problem in ECOSS has been the low count rate at scattering angles where the impulse approximation is valid. Simula-tions showed that the Gatan 666 PEELS should be capable of producing spectra of sufficient accuracy within a dwell time of some 100 s, when dark current and flat field corrections are applied. Prelimi-nary experiments with Al prove that Compton spectra measured on a Gatan 666 attached to a Philips CM 30 compare well with predicted ones. Extraction of the momentum anisotropy on an unprece-dented momentum scale of 0. 04 a. u. (i. e. ~ 0. 07 Å- 1) appears feasible. 1. ECOSS. Electron-Compton scattering on solids (ECOSS) is inelastic scattering of fast electrons under a large scattering angle. As is the case in photon Compton experiments, the scattered particle loses energy (<b>Compton</b> <b>shift),</b> the energy loss for fixed angle being dependent on the initial momentum of the scatterer which is a core- or valence electron of the solid.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} was to test the correctness of the assumption that the initial velocities of electrons in the scattering body cause the observed breadth of the <b>Compton</b> <b>shifted</b> line. The test consists in observing the natural breadths of the Compton line for different scattering angles and primary wave-lengths and comparing these with the functional dependence of breadth on scattering angle and primary wave-length deduced theoretically {{on the basis of the}} assumption under test. It is shown in this paper that if electron velocities are the cause of the breadth then this breadth should increase with the scattering angle according to the approximate formula Δλ=Kcos 1 / 2 θ where Δλ is the breadth, θ the scattering angle and K a constant depending on the primary wave-length and the scattering substance. For the same scattering angle and substance the breadth should be proportional to the primary wave-length. The experimental test was made with the multicrystal spectrograph of fifty units herein briefly described. Three scattering angles were used, 63 ½°, 90 °, 156 °, the inhomogeneity in each case being less than one degree. The spurious breadth due to this inhomogeneity is negligible compared to the observed breadths. Three very clear cut spectrograms are reproduced representing MoK radiation scattered from graphite together with microphotometer curves taken from them. The increase of shifted line breadth with scattering angle is clearly visible and compares favorably with the theoretical prediction. The increase of line breadth with increasing primary wave-length comparing the breadths of shifted α 1 and shifted β 1 lines seems just detectable. The unshifted lines are very sharp, the α doublet being clearly resolved. Incidentally the cause of the heavy background so frequently observed on Compton effect spectrograms has been found to be non-selective scattering at the crystals and a great reduction of background and improvement in contrast has been effected by the use of baffles to diminish this effect. The observed <b>shift</b> of the <b>Compton</b> line supports Compton's formula δλ=(h/mc) (1 -cosθ) where h/mc= 24. 2 X. U. The shifted line breadths are greater than those reported by Gingrich and Bearden and possibly Ross but seem to be in general accord with previous breadths obtained at this laboratory and with those of H. M. Sharp and of F. L. Nutting. The reason for these discrepancies is unknown. The possibility of double or higher multiplicities of scattering is being investigated.

40|$|The first-principles {{periodic}} {{linear combination}} of atomic orbitals method {{within the framework}} of density functional theory implemented in the CRYSTAL 06 code has been applied to explore effect of pressure on the Compton profiles and autocorrelation functions of MgO. Calculations are performed for the B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4, B 8 _ 1 and h-MgO polymorphs of MgO to compute lattice constants and bulk moduli. The isothermal enthalpy calculations predict that B 4 to B 8 _ 1, h-MgO to B 8 _ 1, B 3 to B 2, B 4 to B 2 and h-MgO to B 2 transitions take place at 2, 9, 37, 42 and 64 GPa respectively. The high pressure transitions B 8 _ 1 to B 2 and B 1 to B 2 are found to occur at 340 and 410 GPa respectively. The pressure dependent changes are observed largely in the valence electrons Compton profiles whereas core profiles are almost independent of the pressure in all MgO polymorphs. Increase in pressure results in broadening of the valence Compton profiles. The principal maxima in the second derivative of <b>Compton</b> profiles <b>shifts</b> towards high momentum side in all structures.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to show that {{scattered}} radiation in the backward direction can be used as an additional source of material-specific information about a sample measured simultaneously to a primary method in the fOlWard direction, e. g. X-ray diffraction imaging. Many applications for material and structural discrimination employing X-ray scattering and absorption collimate the emitted radiation in a defined direction. Scattered radiation into other directions often remains disregarded or is shielded. The major physical effects characterising the backward-scattered spectra are, besides attenuation, <b>Compton</b> <b>shift</b> and material-specific Doppler broadening of the photon spectrum in the sample. The shape of a Compton-broadened peak can reveal information about the electron momentum of an element or, even to some extent, of a chemical compound. Since most applications utilises polychromatic X-ray sources the focus of this work was the analysis of Compton scattered characteristic anode peaks from sample materials. The multiplet structure of these characteristic peaks superimposed to a broad Bremsstrahlung spectrum is challenging for peak-shape analysis. The initial part of this work was the design and characterisation of an experimental set-up for measuring energy-resolved Compton scattered spectra of sample materials. Subsequently different calculation models were developed for describing the broadening of the characteristic lines of the anode material. These models were adapted to the specific experimental conditions. Essentially, two types of methods were considered. The first calculation procedure evaluated scattered spectra based on tabulated materialspecific Compton profiles. The second model was a phenomenological approach. It fitted a function consisting of Gaussian curves above a linearly approximated background to the curvature of the 2 nd derivative of the Compton spectrum. These models were experimentally validated on Compton profiles of a variety of sample materials containing period 2 and period 3 elements. It was proven that in principle comparing measured spectra with calculated spectra provides high material differentiation capabilities, but for most molecules tabulated Compton profiles are not available and the independent atom approximation causes deviations. The phenomenological method employed extracted Gaussian curve fit-parameters to distinguish measured materials quantitatively. Most of the samples could be distinguished from each other based on their profile structure. A principal component analysis of corrected spectra provided an alternative approach and showed capabilities to separate scatter-spectra of different materials. In principle, more sample-specific information valuable for material separation could be extracted as compared to a simple integration method of backscattered radiation.

40|$|Nayakshin & Kazanas (2002) have {{considered}} the time-dependent illumination of an accretion disc in Active Galactic Nuclei, in the lamppost model. We extend their study to the flare model, which postulates {{the release of a}} large X-ray flux above a small region of the accretion disc. A fundamental difference with the lamppost model is that the region of the disc below the flare is not illuminated before the onset of the flare. A few test models show that the spectrum which follows immediately the increase in continuum flux should display the characteristics of a highly illuminated but dense gas, i. e. very intense X-ray emission lines and ionization edges in the soft X-ray range. The behaviour of the iron line is different {{in the case of a}} "moderate" and a "strong" flare: for a moderate flare, the spectrum displays a neutral component of the Fe Kα line at 6. 4 keV, gradually leading to more highly ionized lines. For a strong flare, the lines are already emitted by FeXXV (around 6. 7 keV) after the onset, and have an equivalent width of several hundreds of eV. We find that the observed correlations between R, Γ, and the X-ray flux, are well accounted by a combination of flares having not achieved pressure equilibrium, strongly suggesting that the observed spectrum is dominated by regions in non-pressure equilibrium, typical of the onset of the flares. Finally a flare being confined to a small region of the disc, the spectral lines should be narrow (except for a weak <b>Compton</b> broadening), Doppler <b>shifted,</b> and moving.
