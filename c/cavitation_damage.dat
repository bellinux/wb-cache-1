2500|$|Cavitation is {{an event}} {{that can lead to}} MHV failure. While this has been a {{relatively}} rare occurrence, in 1988 the Edwards-Duramedics bileaflet had 46 reported failures in 20,000 implants related to <b>cavitation</b> <b>damage.</b> Since then, manufacturers have made cavitation testing {{an essential part of the}} design verification process. [...] Cavitation is the rapid formation of vaporous microbubbles in the fluid due to a local drop of pressure below the vaporization pressure at a given temperature. When conditions for cavitation are present bubbles will form and at the time of pressure recovery they will collapse or implode. This event will cause pressure or thermal shockwaves and fluid microjets which can damage a surface. These thermodynamic conditions are known to be the cause of MHV related erosion.|$|E
2500|$|The AAIB {{issued a}} further {{bulletin}} on 12 May 2008 which {{confirmed that the}} investigation continued to focus on fuel delivery. It stated that [...] "The reduction in thrust on both engines {{was the result of}} a reduced fuel flow and all engine parameters after the thrust reduction were consistent with this." [...] The report confirmed that the fuel was of good quality and had a freezing point below the coldest temperatures encountered, appearing to rule out fuel freezing as a cause. As in the aforementioned February bulletin, the report noted <b>cavitation</b> <b>damage</b> to the high-pressure fuel pumps of both engines, indicative of abnormally low pressure at the pump inlets. After ruling out fuel freezing or contamination, the investigation then focused on what caused the low pressure at the pump inlets. [...] "Restrictions in the fuel system between the aircraft fuel tanks and each of the engine HP pumps, resulting in reduced fuel flows, is suspected." [...] The fuel delivery system was being investigated at Boeing, and the engines at manufacturer Rolls Royce in Derby.|$|E

The three-phase system is described by the compressible Euler equations supplemented by the stiffened gas law for both fluids, a non-conservative evolution equation for the gas fraction characterizing the liquid-gas interface and the elastodynamical equations for a linear-elastic solid. The fluid model and the solid model are coupled by transition conditions at the fluid-structure interface. The fluid equations are discretized according to Saurel and Abgrall and for the elastodynamical equations a finite volume discretization is applied.

50|$|Cavitation can be {{a problem}} with high power applications, {{resulting}} in damage to propellers or turbines, as well as noise and loss of power. Cavitation occurs when negative pressure causes bubbles (cavities) to form in a liquid, which then promptly and violently collapse.

50|$|When {{water flows}} over a dam spillway, the {{irregularities}} on the spillway surface will cause small areas of flow separation in a high-speed flow, and, in these regions, the pressure will be lowered. If the flow velocities are high enough the pressure may fall to below the local vapor {{pressure of the}} water and vapor bubbles will form. When these are carried downstream into a high pressure region the bubbles collapse giving rise to high pressures and possible <b>cavitation</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E

Just as a garden hose nozzle is used to increase the velocity of water, a {{pressure washer}} creates high pressure and velocity. The pump cannot draw more water from the pipe to which the washer is connected than that source can provide: the water supply must be adequate for the machine connected to it, as water starvation leads to <b>cavitation</b> <b>damage</b> of the pump elements.|$|E

40|$|Major <b>cavitation</b> <b>damages</b> can seriously {{endanger the}} {{stability}} of hydraulic structures, in worst case lead to dam failure. To remedy the effect of cavitation on spillway chutes the most common method today is aeration of the flow. Aerators introduce air to the bottom layers of the flow, enough to prevent damages {{to occur in the}} concrete lining. The design of an aerator system is of a complex manner due to the many involving parameters such as the channel slope, ramp angle, Froude number, flow velocity. In this report the susceptibility of the Höljes Dam to cavitate has been outlined with the result that this would occur at an extreme and most unlikely situation and remedial measures have been proposed. The design of an aerator system has been proposed as the result from theoretical research. A physical hydraulic model to assess the efficiency of a proposed aerator design is highly recommended.

50|$|While wider tracheids with robust walls make it {{possible}} to achieve higher water transport pressures, this increases the problem of cavitation. Cavitation occurs when a bubble of air forms within a vessel, breaking the bonds between chains of water molecules and preventing them from pulling more water up with their cohesive tension. A tracheid, once cavitated, cannot have its embolism removed and return to service (except in a few advanced angiosperms that have developed a mechanism of doing so). Therefore, it is well worth plants' while to avoid cavitation occurring. For this reason, pits in tracheid walls have very small diameters, to prevent air entering and allowing bubbles to nucleate. Freeze-thaw cycles are a major cause of <b>cavitation.</b> <b>Damage</b> to a tracheid's wall almost inevitably leads to air leaking in and cavitation, hence the importance of many tracheids working in parallel.|$|E

50|$|In the Colorado River floods of 1983, Glen Canyon Dam {{exhibited}} poorly {{designed and}} cavitating spillways, strong structural vibrations {{and as a}} result, an inability to bypass enough floodwater {{in the event of}} a major flood. After the 1983 flood, however, the spillways were redesigned with air slots to reduce or eliminate the <b>cavitation</b> <b>damage</b> seen in the 1983 flood. These spillway revisions were tested successfully in 1984. This revision basically eliminates the possibility of the dam being undermined via erosion of the spillways, and reduces the danger of the dam being overtopped - the only reason the lake rose as high as it did was due to the flashboards placed atop the closed spillway gates. If the reservoir rises over the dam crest it would overtop the dam and gradually erode it. This would be dangerous not only because the dam power plant is located at its base, but because the dam is built within porous, erosion-prone Navajo Sandstone; an overtopping would likely lead to erosion of the dam abutments and a subsequent failure. In 1990, the Bureau of Reclamation prepared a study for a Glen Canyon Dam failure, predicting that the resulting flood would scour the bottom few hundred feet of the Grand Canyon, overtop Hoover Dam, and cause severe damage all along the lower Colorado River.|$|E
40|$|Recently it {{has become}} more common in the {{construction}} of large dams to reuse diversion tunnels as flood discharge tunnels in the final structure. These tunnels handle large flows with the characteristics of open channel flow. When such large hydrological forces act upon a structure there are several problems to be expected. One of these is the occurrence of cavitation, which could have potential hazardous erosion as a consequence. Cavitation is the formation and collapse of bubbles that create a shockwave strong enough to erode the underlying material. The Baihetan dam {{is one of the largest}} hydro power projects in China at present. It has three discharge tunnels that all run the risk of developing <b>cavitation</b> <b>damages.</b> By modelling one of the tunnels using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) it is possible to investigate where in the tunnel structure cavitation is likely to occur. This degree project assesses the risk of cavitation erosion in the Baihetan tunnel using the static pressure distribution, the velocity distribution and modern cavitation theory. Several modifications of the tunnel – including alterations in the gradient and construction parameters – are simulated in order to investigate if changes in the design can mitigate the cavitation problem. None of the analysed modifications completely eliminate the problem and aeration is recommended to counteract the problem.
