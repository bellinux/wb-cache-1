25|$|If {{production}} and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008, proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150 years.

According to James Hansen the single most important action needed to tackle the <b>climate</b> <b>crisis</b> is to reduce CO2 emissions from coal. Indonesia and Australia exported together 57.1% of the world coal export in 2011. China, Japan, South Korea, India and Taiwan had 65% share of all the world coal import in 2011.|$|E

There they met with local activists and gathered mud and dirt from mountains that had been exploded in the area, which they brought back to New York City and used in several direct actions targeting the ATM lobbies of Chase Bank, at the time the world's largest financier of mountaintop removal.|$|E

First, it is about replacing fossil fuels with biofuels and replacing non-degradable products with bio-degradable ones. Second, the bioeconomy could boost the productivity and product development within agriculture, fisheries, forestry and the chemical industry.

500|$|In [...] "extensive exit polling" [...] of An Inconvenient Truth in [...] "conservative {{suburban}} markets like Plano and Irvine (Orange County), {{as well as}} Dallas and Long Island", 92 percent rated [...] "Truth" [...] highly and 87 {{percent of}} the respondents said they'd recommend the film to a friend. University of Washington professor Michele Poff argued that Gore was successful in communicating to conservative-leaning audiences by framing the <b>climate</b> <b>crisis</b> as apolitical. [...] "Gore’s and the environment’s identification with the Democratic Party posed a significant challenge to reaching Republicans and conservatives, as well as those disgruntled with politics in general," [...] Poff wrote. [...] "To appeal to such individuals, Gore framed the matter as distinctly apolitical — as an issue both outside politics and one that was crucial regardless of one’s ideological leanings. These explicit attempts to frame the issue as apolitical take on further gravitas when we consider how Gore infused the film with reflections of conservative values. Indeed, Gore reached deeply into the value structure of American conservatives to highlight ideals that suggested his cause was not liberal, but rather was beyond politics, beyond ideology." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 2008 primaries, Gore {{remained}} neutral {{toward all}} of the candidates which led to speculation that he {{would come out of}} a brokered 2008 Democratic National Convention as a [...] "compromise candidate" [...] if the party decided it could not nominate one. Gore responded by stating that these events would not take place because a candidate would be nominated through the primary process. Senator Ted Kennedy had urged Gore to endorse Senator Barack Obama though Gore declined. When Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president on June 3, 2008, speculation began that Gore might be tapped for the vice presidency. On June 16, 2008, one week after Hillary Clinton had suspended her campaign, Gore endorsed Obama in a speech given in Detroit, Michigan which renewed speculation of an Obama-Gore ticket. Gore stated, however, that he was not interested in being Vice President again. On the timing and nature of Gore's endorsement, some argued that Gore waited because {{he did not want to}} repeat his calamitous early endorsement of Howard Dean during the 2004 Presidential Election. On the final night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, shortly before Obama delivered his acceptance address, Gore gave a speech offering his full support. Such support led to new speculation after Obama was elected President during the 2008 Presidential election that Gore would be named a member of the Obama administration. This speculation was enhanced by a meeting held between Obama, Gore, and Joe Biden in Chicago on December 9, 2008. However, Democratic officials and Gore's spokeswoman stated that during the meeting the only subject under discussion was the <b>climate</b> <b>crisis,</b> and Gore would not be joining the Obama administration. On December 19, 2008, Gore described Obama's environmental administrative choices of Carol Browner, Steven Chu, and Lisa Jackson as [...] "an exceptional team to lead the fight against the climate crisis." ...|$|E

40|$|Amidst {{multiple}} reinforcing {{social and}} ecological crises dominant development agencies are discursively shifting {{the place and}} role of agriculture from the periphery {{to the center of}} the development agenda. While development discourse is touting the role of smallholder agriculture in supporting development processes and multifunctional agriculture to meet sustainability objectives, the different framings of problems and solutions between the World Development Report 2008 (World Bank 2008) and the International Assessment of Agriculture Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD 2008) are exposing contradictions and tensions within dominant development discourse. This thesis explores the ways in which the reframing of agriculture as a response to food, energy, and <b>climate</b> <b>crises</b> is being constituted within and external to development discourses, and the potentials for an alternative development. I argue that we are, indeed, in a moment of transition in which the epistemic tensions within development discourse are providing space for a radical shift in how agriculture is conceptualized (and practiced) vis-a-vis food, energy, and <b>climate</b> <b>crises,</b> providing an opportunity for social movements advocating food and fuel sovereignty to flourish within the interstices of the competing visions of agriculture in development discourse. In conclusion, I explore how the discursive and political interventions of the food sovereignty movement, in a moment of declining confidence in agro-industrial food and energy systems, is reformulating the original agrarian question and establishing food sovereignty as the basis for development alternatives. In this transitional moment agrarian social movements are reclaiming the political subjectivity of peasant agriculture grounded on the social and ecological benefits of peasant agrecological practices and knowledges...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change is}} a {{phenomenon}} that affects different facets of human livelihood. However, the general public does not easily comprehend it. This study {{was inspired by the}} realization that climate change is not just an ecological entity but that social processes have a crucial role to play in responding to the <b>climate</b> change <b>crisis.</b> Community perception is critical because it determines response to the crisis. Social capital has been identified as key in creating a framework for understanding community dynamics. In the Mara River Basin in Kenya, a fragile environment that supports a large population in Western Kenya, social capital has been analyzed by this study and linked to community perception of the <b>climate</b> change <b>crisis</b> within the basin.
