40|$|Objective To combine {{insights}} from service users with long-term conditions (LTCs) {{to assist the}} development of a <b>community</b> <b>referral</b> intervention designed to promote engagement and improve access to health-relevant resources. Background Social deprivation and reduced access to resources have been causally linked with social isolation and the ability to manage LTCs. Participation in meaningful activity has been associated with positive health benefits, and strategies to promote access to community activities have shown some potential to improve outcomes for people with LTCs. This suggests the need to develop an engagement and referral intervention in partnership with service users and community groups as part of mainstream self-care support. Method A series of focus groups and interviews with members of community groups in Greater Manchester designed as an iterative and collaborative approach to elicit the role of personal and community networks that support long-term condition management (LTCM) to develop a <b>community</b> <b>referral</b> tool. Results Participants reported a broad range of resources relevant to LTCM that often went beyond the usual concerns associated with self-care. This helped to inform a tool (PLANS) to tailor access to types of community-based resources which can support LTCM. Conclusions Understanding the everyday challenges of living with a LTC highlighted the importance of connecting and engaging with localized support for people. In response to this, we developed an intervention (PLANS) which tailors access to local resources based on personal preferences, needs and acceptability to encourage service users to engage with sustainable health choices...|$|E

40|$|The Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) {{program is}} a home visitation program that targets low income parents expecting their first child. With the nurse {{delivering}} services, the {{program is designed to}} facilitate positive changes that improve health outcomes for the woman and her baby. Despite successful program implementation in mostly urban communities across the United States, obstacles exist to implement Nurse Family Partnership in rural communities. The purpose of this practice inquiry was to collaborate with Pima County Health Department and Nurse Family Partnership to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the Nurse Family Partnership program in Pima County rural communities. As part of this practice inquiry collaboration, the first aim completed a community assessment of Arivaca to identify rural community strengths and potential barriers to implementation and thus serve as an implementation prototype for Pima County Health Department. Descriptive statistics were utilized from the Arizona Department of Health Services Arizona Vital Statistics, U. S. Census Bureau, and Arizona Department of Health Services needs assessment data sets to assess population characteristics and the Nurse Family Partnership eligible population in Arivaca. Additionally, a windshield survey was conducted to assess <b>community</b> <b>referral</b> capacity and/or program champions, existing public/community health programs or services linkages, and issues due to rurality such as transportation challenges and driving time/distances. The second practice inquiry aim developed an implementation plan, including an evaluation component, alongside Pima County Health Department that expands Nurse Family Partnership into additional rural communities in Pima County. The Nurse Family Partnership implementation plan template was utilized to identify community need and population characteristics, Pima County Health Department mission and culture, organization capacity, nursing practice and support, community linkages, sustainability, and financing and fiscal policy support. Descriptive statistics were utilized from the Arizona Department of Health Services Arizona Vital Statistics, U. S. Census Bureau, and Arizona Department of Health Services needs assessment data sets to describe a community profile to complete the Nurse Family Partnership implementation plan template. This practice inquiry demonstrated that completion of a windshield survey and review of descriptive data sets in the proposed service areas helps to identify <b>community</b> <b>referral</b> capacity and/or program champions, existing public/community health programs or services linkages, and issues due to rurality. This process {{can be used as a}} prototype for Pima County Health Department prior to implementation in the entire proposed service area...|$|E
40|$|Summary: One-third or more {{of persons}} {{presenting}} to Emergency Rooms (ER) /Accident and Emergency departments in psychiatric emergencies report experiencing suicidal ideations. A critical task for hospital-based practitioners is to assess the lethality of the situation {{to determine whether the}} person should be hospitalized. Practitioners often employ standardized assessment instruments to assist in determining the suicidal risk factors, yet such measures often fail to recognize or consider the following: 1) the relative importance of the therapeutic process in creating meaningful therapeutic change; 2) the quality of the therapeutic encounter in the ER; and 3) follow-through with the <b>community</b> <b>referral</b> process. Findings: This article proposes the use of the actual ER encounter between client and practitioner to work with suicidal risk factors that are amenable to immediate therapeutic change. Using a therapy approach that can positively impact a client’s level of hopelessness and allow for the assessment of suicide risk can work to ensure that an appropriate hospitalization disposition is reached. Application: This article details how the use of solution-focused therapy provides one avenue for assessing suicide risk and how the therapeutic intervention, which has not been subjected to the scrutiny of empirical research, can serve as an opportunity for increasing hope...|$|E

40|$|Differentiation {{of serious}} {{bacterial}} infection (SBI) from self-limiting viral illness in febrile infants younger {{than three months}} is a significant challenge for clinicians. We aimed to assess the risk factors for SBI in febrile infants. Data were obtained from 221 infants younger than three months who visited a single <b>community</b> <b>referral</b> hospital for fever and underwent a complete sepsis workup between August 2003 and July 2006. The causes of fever were febrile illness without a documented cause (FISDC, 65 %), urinary tract infection (UTI, 12 %), aseptic meningitis (12 %), bacteremia (4 %), bacterial meningitis (2 %). Cerebrospinal fluid enterovirus polymerase chain reaction was positive in 28 % of FISDC and 48 % of aseptic meningitis cases. When UTI was excluded, the risk factors for SBI were 1) C-reactive protein (CRP) level of ≥ 1. 87 mg/dL and 2) fevers of ≥ 38. 9 ℃. The specificity and negative predictive values of risk factors 1) and 2) for the diagnosis of SBI were 94 % and 95 %, respectively. We concluded that enteroviral infection may be {{a major cause of}} febrile episodes in infants younger than three months. If UTI could be excluded, the presence of CRP levels ≥ 1. 87 mg/dL and fevers of ≥ 38. 9 ℃ can be used as criteria to rule out SBI in these infants...|$|E
40|$|Better known {{models of}} social {{prescribing}} include: ‘Arts on Prescription’; ‘Books on Prescription’; ‘Education on Prescription’; ‘Exercise on Prescription’ and ‘Volunteering’. Lesser known <b>community</b> <b>referral</b> models include ‘Green Gyms’ (activities and exercise {{in a natural}} environment) and other ‘Healthy Living Initiatives’; ‘Computerised Cognitive Behavioural Therapy’ (online self-help reading often facilitated); ‘Supported Referral’ (any scheme supported by a facilitator); ‘Social Enterprise Schemes’ (disadvantaged people employed in the workplace); ‘Supported Employment’ (an advisor supporting employee in work); ‘Time banks’ (volunteered time used as currency); and ‘Information Prescriptions’ (‘signposting’ to available services within communities often via websites). The term ‘prescribing’ potentially connects us up with a medical model of care; there are plusses and minuses to this link which need to be considered. An alternative term might be ‘referral’ which broadens the process to people outside of medics. There are several components of social prescribing. These include the programme or activity itself (e. g. group singing for people with dementia); what the scheme hopes to achieve (health, wellbeing and/ or social outcomes need to be stipulated); how the scheme fits in with a care pathway, local health and social priorities and public health and/or health care policy objectives. Rationale: Social prescribing in the UK has been brought about by decentralisation of  healthcare decision making from national to local government, {{an emphasis on the}} notion that prevention is sometimes more attainable than cure, and the organisation of multi-agency and more holistic approaches to healthcare...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the development and}} evaluation of an mHealth intervention for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) referral from drugstores to health facilities in Mwanza Tanzania. SRH {{is an important factor}} for human development. Over the last 2 decades, provision and accessibility to SRH services has benefited from international and national health promotion interventions. In developing countries, use of close to community providers (CTC providers), such as village health workers, has been a key component of health promotion. This has been especially true in Tanzania where up to 70 % of formal primary health care facilities lack health staff. CTC providers have been promoted through international initiatives such as the World Health Organization’s (WHO) task-shifting initiative. WHO’s recognition of CTC providers ranges from cadres at the grassroots level such as village health workers and drugstores to formal auxiliary providers based in health facilities, such as medical aides and nurses. In Tanzania, drugstores provide a range of SRH services ranging from simple advice on how to use a condom to complex prescriptions of antibiotics for STI treatment. Evidence has shown that drugstores – though more likely to have health-related training than any other informal CTC providers – lack skills necessary for provision of SRH services. This may contribute to poor SRH outcomes, such as increase in prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) /human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antibiotic resistance. Accessing SRH services at the formal health facility level is key to improving these outcomes. To create SRH service linkages and integration between drugstores and health facilities in Mwanza, Tanzania, an intervention that pioneered an mHealth SRH referral from drugstores to health facilities was designed and implemented for 18 months from September 2012 to February 2014. Referral between these two SRH providers using mHealth tools had not been attempted before. The intervention provided an electronic platform accessible to 52 drugstores and 18 health facilities in two districts of Mwanza region. Through a toll-free number and password, drugstores referred patients with SRH conditions to health facilities using the text-messaging feature on their mobile phones. From the platform’s in-built data collection tool, SRH uptake data demonstrated that 38 % of patients referred from drugstores accessed HIV, STIs, family planning and maternal health services at the health facility level. A follow-up randomised household survey found that 72 % of the participants would accept such type of referral in future, and among those who had ever visited drugstores for SRH services, 15 % had heard about the intervention. At the end of the intervention, drugstores and health facilities confirmed that it was beneficial to their SRH service provision and {{that they would like to}} continue implementing it. In conclusion, this text messaging intervention pioneered <b>community</b> <b>referral</b> from drugstores to health facilities for SRH treatment by using mobile phones which appeared to be acceptable and effective in Mwanza Tanzania.

Methods: Service evaluation of teleophthalmology consultation based on spectral domain optical coherence tomography images acquired by the community optometrist and transmitted to hospital eye services. Results: Fifty patients with suspected macular conditions were managed via telemedicine consultation over 1 year. Responses were provided by hospital eye service-based ophthalmologists to the community optometrist or patient within {{the next day in}} 48 cases (96 %) and in 34 (68 %) patients on the same day. In the consensus opinion of the optometrist and ophthalmologist, 33 (66 %) patients required further &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; medical examination and were triaged on clinical urgency. Seventeen cases (34 %) were managed in the community and are a potential cost improvement. Specialty trainees were supervised in telemedicine consultations.

40|$|Objectives Young {{people in}} Tanzania {{are known to}} access {{reproductive}} health services {{from a range of}} close-to-community providers outside formal health settings such as drug stores, village AIDS committees, traditional healers and traditional birth attendants (TBAs). However, questions remain about the quality of services such agents provide. This study investigated their capacity to provide adolescent reproductive health (ARH) services and explored their readiness and ability to integrate with the mainstream health sector through <b>community</b> <b>referral</b> interventions. Methods Thirty-five focus group discussions exploring close-to-community provider experiences and attitudes to ARH service provision were carried out in two districts in Northern Tanzania. Discussions were conducted in Kiswahili, digitally recorded, verbatim-transcribed, translated and back-translated from Swahili to English. A thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo 9. Results The major close-to-community cadres providing reproductive health services were drug stores, traditional healers, TBAs and village health workers. They reported being the first port of call for adolescents seeking reproductive health services, but their knowledge of ARH needs was poor. They had negative attitudes to, and lacked the necessary resources for, the provision of such services for adolescents. Some were particularly unwilling to provide condom services and were prejudiced against adolescents using them. There was poor integration between the close-to-community providers and the formal health sector, further limiting their ability to provide adequate services. Conclusions Although close-to-community providers are considered a key resource in the community, most have limited capacity to provide ARH services. Without capacity-building investments such as training and cooperation with the mainstream health sector, their contribution to positive reproductive health outcomes is limited, or could indeed lead to adverse outcomes...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{effectiveness}} of depression treatment in {{racial and ethnic}} minority women. REVIEW METHODS: Inclusion criteria: 1) the study examined treatment of depression among racial and ethnic minority women age > 17, 2) data analysis was separated by race and ethnicity, and 3) {{the study was conducted}} in the United States. Interventions considered were: psychotropic medications, psychotherapy (including cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal therapy and any type of psychotherapy adapted for minority populations) and any type of psychotherapy combined with case management or a religious focus. Individual and group psychotherapy were eligible. Each study was critically reviewed to identify treatment effectiveness specific to racial and ethnic minority women. RESULTS: Ten published studies met the inclusion criteria (racial and ethnic minority participants n = 2, 136). Seven of these were randomized clinical trials, one was a retrospective cohort study, one was a case series, and the remaining one had an indeterminate study design. Participants' age ranged from 18 - 74 years, with a higher proportion > 40 years. Most were low income. Differences in treatment responses between African-American, Latino and white women were found. Adapted models of care, including quality improvement and collaborative care, were found to be more effective than usual care and <b>community</b> <b>referral</b> in treating depression. Although medication and psychotherapy were both effective in treating depression, low-income women generally needed case management to address other social issues.
