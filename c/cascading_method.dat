40|$|Partial {{differential}} equation (PDE) models {{are commonly used}} to model complex dynamic systems in applied sciences such as biology and finance. The forms of these PDE models are usually proposed by experts based on their prior {{knowledge and understanding of}} the dynamic system. Parameters in PDE models often have interesting scientific interpretations, but their values are often unknown and need to be estimated from the measurements of the dynamic system in the presence of measurement errors. Most PDEs used in practice have no analytic solutions, and can only be solved with numerical methods. Currently, methods for estimating PDE parameters require repeatedly solving PDEs numerically under thousands of candidate parameter values, and thus the computational load is high. In this article, we propose two methods to estimate parameters in PDE models: a parameter <b>cascading</b> <b>method</b> and a Bayesian approach. In both methods, the underlying dynamic process modeled with the PDE model is represented via basis function expansion. For the parameter <b>cascading</b> <b>method,</b> we develop two nested levels of optimization to estimate the PDE parameters. For the Bayesian method, we develop a joint model for data and the PDE and develop a novel hierarchical model allowing us to employ Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to make posterior inference. Simulation studies show that the Bayesian method and parameter <b>cascading</b> <b>method</b> are comparable, and both outperform other available methods in terms of estimation accuracy. The two methods are demonstrated by estimating parameters in a PDE model from long-range infrared light detection and ranging data.

Container handling and crane deployment are two major yard operations that can impact the performance of a whole container terminal. This thesis establishes an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to combine container handling and yard crane deployment for Rubber Tired Gantry Cranes (RTG). Using real world data, we test the ILP for two different yard sizes. We find the resulting ILPs difficult to solve directly. In order to decrease the computation time, we apply a <b>cascade</b> <b>method</b> that solves the problem as a sequence of restricted subproblems.

40|$|Inverse {{problems}} have gained popularity in statistical research recently. This dissertation {{consists of two}} statistical inverse problems: a Bayesian approach to detection of small low emission sources on a large random background, and parameter estimation methods for partial differential equation (PDE) models. Source detection problem arises, for instance, in some homeland security applications. We {{address the problem of}} detecting presence and location of a small low emission source inside an object, when the background noise dominates. The goal is to reach the signal-to-noise ratio levels on the order of 10 ^- 3. We develop a Bayesian approach to this problem in two-dimension. The method allows inference not only about the existence of the source, but also about its location. We derive Bayes factors for model selection and estimation of location based on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. A simulation study shows that with sufficiently high total emission level, our method can effectively locate the source. Differential equation (DE) models are widely used to model dynamic processes in many fields. The forward problem of solving equations for given parameters that define the DEs has been extensively studied in the past. However, the inverse problem of estimating parameters based on observed state variables is relatively sparse in the statistical literature, and this is especially the case for PDE models. We propose two joint modeling schemes to solve for constant parameters in PDEs: a parameter <b>cascading</b> <b>method</b> and a Bayesian treatment. In both methods, the unknown functions are expressed via basis function expansion. For the parameter <b>cascading</b> <b>method,</b> we develop the algorithm to estimate the parameters and derive a sandwich estimator of the covariance matrix. For the Bayesian method, we develop the joint model for data and the PDE, and describe how the Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is employed to make posterior inference.

The three approaches are illustrated using simulated examples and compared via simulation studies. Simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform the two-stage method...|$|E

40|$|Quite {{a number}} of {{coordination}} methods have been proposed for the distributed optimal design of large-scale systems consisting of {{a number of}} interacting subsystems. Several coordination methods are known to have numerical convergence difficulties that can be explained theoretically. The methods for which convergence proofs are available have mostly been developed for so called quasi-separable problems (i. e. problems with individual subsystems coupled only through a set of linking variables, not through constraints and/or objectives). In this paper we present a new coordination approach for MDO problems with linking variables as well as coupling objectives and constraints. Two formulation variants are presented offering a large degree of freedom in tailoring the coordination algorithm to the design problem at hand. The first, centralized variant introduces a master problem to coordinate coupling of the subsystems. The second, distributed variant coordinates coupling directly between subsystems. Our coordination approach employs an augmented Lagrangian penalty relaxation in combination with a block coordinate descent method. The proposed coordination algorithms can be shown to converge to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of the original problem by using existing convergence results. We illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach by showing that the Analytical Target <b>Cascading</b> <b>method</b> of [18] and theaugmented Lagrangian method for quasi-separable problems of [20] are subclasses of the proposed formulations...|$|E

It is based on the outcomes of the study performed by the University of Calgary and financed by the European 6 th Framework Programme for Research and Development as part of the research project PROGENY. The existing MCAR literature is reviewed and eight possible variations of the general MCAR processing scheme are identified based on two possible options for the mathematical model of the float solution, two options for the estimation technique used for the float solution, and finally two possible options for the ambiguity resolution process. The two most promising methods, geometry-based filtered cascading and geometry-based filtered LAMBDA, are analysed in detail for two simulated users modelled after polar orbiting LEOs through an extensive covariance simulation. Both the proposed Galileo constellation and Galileo used in conjunction with the GPS constellation are tested and results are presented in terms of probabilities of correct ambiguity resolution and float and fixed solution baseline accuracies.

Such knowledge offers interesting insights into behavioral usage patterns and often can help to better support a user. However, most existing query log studies focus on search sessions only (consecutive queries {{for the same}} need) and ignore multitasking behavior (interleaved information needs) as well as hierarchies of short-term search goals in multiple sessions that form a long-term search task such as vacation planning. To better understand the dialog between user and search engine we distinguish between (1) physical search sessions, characterized by the time gap between queries, (2) logical search sessions, characterized by consecutive queries for the same information need within a physical session, and (3) search missions, characterized by logical sessions, multitasking behavior, and hierarchical goals.
