2500|$|In {{this mode}} the radio wave propagates by {{interacting}} with the <b>conductive</b> <b>surface</b> of the Earth. The wave [...] "clings" [...] {{to the surface and}} thus follows the curvature of the Earth. [...] Ground waves propagate in vertical polarization so vertical antennas (monopoles) are required. [...] Since the ground is not a perfect electrical conductor, ground waves are attenuated as they follow the Earth’s surface. [...] Attenuation is proportional to the frequency making this mode mainly useful for LF and VLF frequencies (see also Earth-ionosphere waveguide).|$|E
2500|$|The quarter-wave {{monopole}} antenna is a single-element antenna fed at one end, that behaves as a dipole antenna. It is formed by a conductor [...] in length, fed {{in the lower}} end, which is near a <b>conductive</b> <b>surface</b> which works as a reflector (see effect of ground) and {{is an example of}} a Marconi antenna. The current in the reflected image has the same direction and phase as the current in the real antenna. The quarter-wave conductor and its image together form a half-wave dipole that radiates only in the upper half of space.|$|E

This way, by causing the hand palm to bear on the raised side portions allows to discharge a large part of the weight of the arm on the <b>conductive</b> <b>surfaces</b> substantially without any muscle tension and without any movement, which would affect the contact surface during the acquisition, and substantially without any noise associated thereto, so that a filtering passband can be chosen that has a lower limit value lower than in the prior art devices, which allows preserving a large part of the information content of the electrocardiographic signal...|$|R

2500|$|A static {{dissipative}} mat that {{rests on a}} <b>conductive</b> <b>surface</b> (commonly the case in military facilities) are typically made of 3 layers (3-ply) with {{static dissipative}} vinyl layers surrounding a conductive substrate which is electrically attached to ground (earth). For commercial uses, static dissipative rubber mats are traditionally used that are made of 2 layers (2-ply) with a tough solder resistant top static dissipative layer that makes them last longer than the vinyl mats, and a conductive rubber bottom. Conductive mats are made of carbon and used only on floors {{for the purpose of}} drawing static electricity to ground as quickly as possible. Normally conductive mats are made with cushioning for standing and are referred to as [...] "anti-fatigue" [...] mats.|$|E
2500|$|Type of document: [...] {{as noted}} above, an EDD {{works well with}} a single sheet of paper up to a legal-sized sheet. However, if there are {{concerns}} about biological or chemical contamination, due to {{the condition of the}} questioned document, it is possible to use a second sheet of clean paper, e.g. copier paper, known to be free of indentations as a barrier between the platen and questioned document. Books and other multipage items can also be examined in some instances but these require additional preparation. [...] Ideally, individual pages should be removed from such items but this is not always possible.

2500|$|In a QDSC, a {{mesoporous}} {{layer of}} titanium dioxide nanoparticles forms {{the backbone of}} the cell, much like in a DSSC.

The electrical circuit is then completed {{through the use of a}} liquid or solid redox couple. The efficiency of QDSCs has increased to over 5% shown for both liquid-junction and solid state cells. In an effort to decrease production costs, the Prashant Kamat research group demonstrated a solar paint made with [...] and CdSe that can be applied using a one-step method to any <b>conductive</b> <b>surface</b> with efficiencies over 1%. However, the absorption of quantum dots (QDs) in QDSCs is weak at room temperature. The plasmonic nanoparticles can be utilized to address the weak absorption of QDs (e.g., nanostars). Adding an external infrared pumping sources to excite intraband and interband transition of QDs is another solution.|$|E

50|$|Test and {{supporting}} equipment configurations {{to be used}} within anechoic chambers must expose as few metallic (<b>conductive)</b> <b>surfaces</b> as possible, as these risk causing unwanted reflections.

40|$|Abstract. Silvered {{polyimide}} {{films have}} been prepared by alkali hydroxylation of polyimide film surface and incorporation of silver ions through subsequent ion exchange. Thermal curing had not only re-cycloimidized the poly(amic acid) into polyimide, but also reduced silver ions into silver atoms and near-atomic silver clusters, which diffused and aggregated to give reflective and <b>conductive</b> <b>surfaces</b> without addition of reducing agents. By this method, silvered polyimide films can be easily fabricated with double excellent reflective (reflectivity> 97 %) and <b>conductive</b> <b>surfaces</b> (surface resistance: 0. 02 Ω/sq), outstanding metal-polymer adhesion, high mechanical properties, and controllable thickness of silver layers at modest cost. As the side-to-side near-surface microstructure difference in the laboratory made samples and commercial PI films, the thickness of alkali induced hydrolysis, loading of silver ions and forming of silver layers at {{the two sides of}} the polyimide films were also discussed here. Films were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results show that continuous silver layers were formed on the polyimide films...|$|R

5000|$|A topological {{insulator}} is {{a material}} with non-trivial topological order that behaves as an insulator in its interior but whose surface contains conducting states, meaning that electrons can only move along {{the surface of}} the material.
