40|$|Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine, <b>cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine,</b> 3 -nitro- 1, 2, 4 -triazole- 5 -one and hexanitrostilbene were {{effectively}} {{reduced in}} size in an ultrasound cavitation field. It {{was found that}} the topology and morphology of the crystalline materials had a decisive influence on the effectiveness of the size reduction process. The higher the frequency of defect sites on the crystalline surface, the more effective was the size reduction of particles through ultrasound induced shear forces. Varying the intensity of the ultrasound energy had no significant influence on the degree of size reduction obtained. Because size reduction occurred in the region around the sonotrode, the size reduction effectiveness and size distribution achievable are especially dependant on the process design...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} and compatibility between diaminoazofuraz (DAAzF) and some energetic materials are studied by using pressure {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) method. The energetic materials include <b>cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine</b> (HMX), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), nitrocellulose (NC), nitroglycerine (NG), 125 / 100 –NC/NG mixture (NC + NG), N-nitrodihydroxyethylaminedinitrate (DINA), aluminum powder (Al), and 3, 4 -dinitrofurzanfuroxan (DNTF). The results show that there are obvious interactions between DAAzF and DNTF, DINA, HMX or RDX, while weak interactions between DAAzF and NC, NG, NC + NG or Al. According to the evaluated standard of compatibility, the binary systems of DAAzF with NC, NG, NC + NG and Al are compatible, the binary system of it with RDX is slightly sensitive, the binary systems of it with HMX and DINA are sensitive, and the binary system of it with DNTF is hazardous...|$|E
30|$|To {{improve the}} safety of {{ammonium}} nitrate explosives, the melamine urea-formaldehyde resin (MUF resin) was selected for the preparation of three typical nitramine explosives (<b>cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine,</b> HMX; cryclo-trimethylenetrinitramine, RDX; and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane, CL- 20) based green polymer-bonded explosives (GPBXs) via interfacial polymerization. Meanwhile, the corresponding composite particles prepared by physical mixing and drying bath methods were studied and compared. The particle morphology, crystal structure, thermal stability, and safety performance of the resultant composite particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and impact sensitivity test, respectively. SEM results showed that MUF was successfully coated {{on the surface of}} the three explosives, and different composite particles prepared by the same method have their own unique characteristics. Such effect is attributed to the resin’s ability to isolate and buffer external stimuli. It is obvious that the interfacial polymerization is an effective desensitization technique to prepare core-shell composite particles for explosives.|$|E
40|$|A seeding {{strategy}} {{was developed in}} the preparation of <b>cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine</b> (HMX) explosive micro-particles by solvent-antisolvent method, to control their polymorphs from dangerous gamma (γ) type to the desired and standard beta (β) form with the size distribution of < 10. 0  μm, by using a low concentration of β-HMX fine particles as micro-seed in the antisolvent medium. All products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and dynamic light scattering particle size analyzer. In the next step, the effective factors on the sizes and morphologies of micro-particles in the presence and absence of two soft templates of poly (ethylene glycol) - 400 (PEG- 400) polymer and coconut fatty acid diethanolamide (lauramide) surfactant were investigated. The results of experiments showed that using of water-soluble PEG- 400 in the low antisolvent temperatures leads to the production of very spherical particles. Also non-ionic surfactant of lauramide, direct the crystal growth to needle-like structures. The advantages of this method are its capability for the simple production of β-HMX micro-particles in the large scale production process, with the various crystal structures and particles size distributions...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors report on {{continuing}} work involving {{a series of}} deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) experiments in which they study the piston-initiated DDT of heavily confined granular <b>cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine</b> (HMX). These experiments were designed to he useful in model development and evaluation. A main focus of these experiments {{is the effect of}} density on the DDT event. Particle size distribution and morphology are carefully characterized. In this paper they present recent surface area analysis. Earlier studies demonstrated extensive fracturing and agglomeration in samples at densities as low as 75 % TMD as evidenced by dramatic decreases in particle size distribution due to mild stimulus. This is qualitatively confirmed with SEM images and quantitatively studied with gas absorption surface area analysis. Also, in this paper they present initial results using a microwave interferometer technique. Dynamic calibration of the technique was performed, a 35 GHz signal is used to increase resolution, and the system has been designed to be inexpensive for repeated experiments. The distance to where deformation of the inner wall begins for various densities is reported. This result is compared with the microwave interferometer measurements...|$|E
30|$|For decades, {{conventional}} “trialdehyde” binders {{have been}} the focus of research for scholars at home and abroad. With the comprehensive performance continuously improving, relevant reports on their applications have begun to appear in the field of energetic materials. In 2015, Yang et al. [16] used 3 % melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin monomer to coat CL- 20, HMX, and RDX. The as-prepared particles had a compact and uniform MF resin coating layer, and their thermal stability and safety properties are greatly improved. This article has similarities with that report because we have also found that melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin is more suitable as an explosive binder material, compared with melamine-formaldehyde resin. MF resin has excellent performance; however, it is brittle and costly. The {{most important thing is that}} the MF resin product cannot be stored for a long time. If it is used as a coating material to fabricate energetic composite particles with a core-shell structure, it is likely to cause impaired properties of the particles. Li et al [17] prepared <b>cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine</b> at thermoplastic polyester-ether elastomer (HMX @ TPEE) energetic microspheres with particle size distribution ranging from 50 to 200 [*]μm via an emulsion solvent evaporation (ESV) method, and the resultant particles had lower sensitivity and higher thermal stability. In this paper, an improved drying bath method was proposed, and the polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) with excellent comprehensive performance were prepared by using melamine urea-formaldehyde resin (MUF resin) as the shell material and three different explosives as the core material. Wang et al. [18] obtained 30 -nm cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine/nitrocellulose (HMX/NC) nanocomposites with good comprehensive property by an improved sol-gel-supercritical method. It can be seen that the choice of binder has a great influence on the morphology, particle size, and performance of the resultant PBXs.|$|E
