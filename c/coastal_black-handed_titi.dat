50|$|The <b>coastal</b> <b>black-handed</b> <b>titi</b> (Callicebus melanochir) is {{a species}} of titi, a type of New World monkey, endemic to Brazil.|$|E
50|$|Protected flora include Aechmea gustavoi, Baptistonia truncata, Begonia itaguassuensis, Brachionidium restrepioides, Canistrum camacaense, Canistrum montanum, Davilla macrocarpa, Euterpe edulis, Heteropterys bullata, Hiraea bullata, Hirtella santosii, Houlletia brocklehurstiana, Huberia carvalhoi, Inga grazielae, Licania belemii, Octomeria geraensis, Paralychnophora bicolor, Portea nana, Solanum bahianum, Solanum restingae and Trichopilia santoslimae.Protected mammals include maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus), <b>coastal</b> <b>black-handed</b> <b>titi</b> (Callicebus melanochir), golden-bellied {{capuchin}} (Sapajus xanthosternos), golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas), bristle-spined rat (Chaetomys subspinosus) and cougar (Puma concolor).|$|E

50|$|The {{collared}} titi is {{not considered}} to be endangered, but where there are many colonists this primate tends to disappear, due to deforestation. The species is commonly hunted and eaten by indigenous peoples or used as bait for hunting larger carnivores or for fishing; however, where there is plenty of forest meat the species is found commonly close to Indian settlements. The species is classified Least Concern (formerly LR) in the IUCN Red List. Actually the Colombian <b>black-handed</b> <b>titi</b> may be slightly endangered due to its presence in a zone of heavy colonization, but presently it is classified LC with the other subspecies. Fortunately the Colombian <b>black-handed</b> <b>titi</b> is found in La Paya National Park in Colombia, although the park itself is very vulnerable to surrounding colonization. The Lucifer titi is protected in Colombia by Amacayacu National Park and Cahuinarí National Park, while the black titi may be protected in Chiribiquete National Park and El Tuparro National Park and in the two biological preserves Nukak and Puinawai. Actually a clarification of the taxonomic status of many populations is needed to be able to monitor their conservation state.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the 1980s the Callicebus genus was revised {{from the}} Hershkovitz concept of three species to {{thirteen}} neotropical species, with the collared titi, Callicebus torquatus, having four subspecies. In 2001 Colin Groves elevated one of the subspecies, the Colombian <b>black-handed</b> <b>titi,</b> C. t. medemi, to Callicebus medemi and a year later Van Roosmalen et al. elevated the remaining subspecies to species. These last changes were made with few arguments to support the changes and were apparently influenced by the increasing use of the so-called phylogenetic species concept of Cracraft, which seeks to define species as the [...] "smallest diagnosable cluster of individual organisms within which there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent." [...] This might work given enough information, which is usually not the case. The recent discovery of a diploid number of 16 for the black titi, Callicebus lugens, in Brazil certainly suggests that (with the previously known 2n=20 of another, unidentified population of C. torquatus) {{there are at least two}} species in this complex. But whether the Lucifer titi, Callicebus lucifer, or the Colombian <b>black-handed</b> <b>titi,</b> Callicebus medemi, are good species from this complex is in doubt. They are probably subspecies of Callicebus torquatus. Nevertheless, in this treatment C. torquatus is used in the sense of Hershkovitz (1990) until the systematics of this species complex becomes clearer.|$|R
5000|$|... 175 {{bird species}} have been identified, {{including}} 27 that are endemic and six that are threatened.They include red-billed curassow (Crax blumenbachii), red-browed amazon (Amazona rhodocorytha) and ochre-marked parakeet (Pyrrhura cruentata).9 species of small mammals have been recorded and 30 species of medium or large mammals. These include golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas), golden-bellied capuchin (Sapajus xanthosternos), cougar (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and <b>coastal</b> <b>black-handed</b> <b>titi</b> (Callicebus melanochir).At least 45 species of endemic amphibians with limited distribution have been identified, including Hylomantis áspera,Eleutherodactylus bilineatus, Cycloramphus migueli and Hyla sibilata.|$|E
