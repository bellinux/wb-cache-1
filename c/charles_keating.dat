The school's swimming team went on to win many state titles. St. Xavier named the Keating Natatorium after the brothers' father, and inducted <b>Charles</b> <b>Keating</b> into its initial Athletic Hall of Fame class in 1985. The University of Cincinnati's 2006 athletic building is named the Keating Aquatic Center, in honor of William Keating, and donations from the Keating family used to construct it. <b>Charles</b> <b>Keating</b> funded Cincinnati's Marlins swim club; six swimmers on the 1980 Summer Olympics squad were from its roster, including future Olympic champion Mary T.

5|$|In April 1986, Cindy and {{her father}} {{invested}} $359,100 in a shopping center project with Phoenix banker <b>Charles</b> <b>Keating.</b> This, combined with {{her role as a}} bookkeeper who later had difficulty finding receipts for family trips on Keating's jet, caused complications for her husband during the Keating Five scandal, when he was being examined for his role regarding oversight of Keating's bank.|$|E
5|$|The Keating Five scandal was {{prompted}} by the activities of one particular savings and loan: Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, California. Lincoln's chairman was <b>Charles</b> <b>Keating,</b> who ultimately served {{five years in prison}} for his corrupt mismanagement of Lincoln. In the four years after Keating's American Continental Corporation (ACC) had purchased Lincoln in 1984, Lincoln's assets had increased from $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion.|$|E

5|$|In April 1999, {{on the eve}} of the retrial of {{the federal}} case, Keating entered a plea agreement. He {{admitted}} to having committed four counts of wire and bankruptcy fraud by extracting nearly $1 million from American Continental Corp. while already anticipating the collapse that happened weeks later. The federal prosecutors dropped all other charges against him and his son, <b>Charles</b> <b>Keating</b> III. He was sentenced to time served.|$|E
5|$|Keating reaped {{benefits}} from the move to Arizona, a wide-open territory in both a physical and business sense that allowed someone a fresh start. He turned the now-renamed American Continental Corporation around, adding various operations and divisions in a structure somewhat reminiscent of American Financial. As chairman and controlling stockholder, Keating relied heavily upon family members, employing his son and four of his sons-in-law in prominent positions. <b>Charles</b> <b>Keating</b> III had a fast career rise within the company.|$|E
5|$|Keating {{left his}} law {{practice}} in 1972 and formally joined American Financial Corporation, by now a $1 billion enterprise, as executive vice president. Keating became Lindner's {{person in charge}} of firing employees from newly acquired companies. Within business circles Keating gained a reputation for aggressiveness and arrogance. He took on an operational involvement in The Cincinnati Enquirer, the town's only morning newspaper. He interfered in editorial decisions, such as adding coverage to high school sports that he or Lindner's sons were involved in. The paper was then sold to a group including his brother, William, {{who had been a}} Republican congressman from Ohio's 1st congressional district in the early 1970s. <b>Charles</b> <b>Keating</b> was involved in American Financial's 1974 sale of Bantam Books, and its decision that year not to enter the investment banking field.|$|E

25|$|On 3 May, at 7:30am, 125 ISIL militants {{with more}} than 20 {{vehicles}} attacked a Peshmerga position, {{near the town of}} Tel Skuf, 28–30km north of Mosul, where a dozen U.S. troops acting as advisors were visiting. American and Peshmerga forces fought back but the militants broke into the position using three truck bombs followed by bulldozers which cleared the wreckage away. The Peshmerga and U.S. forces called for a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) which responded and joined the battle, helping the advisors and other personnel to withdraw. 11 to 13 U.S. aircraft; F-15s F-16s, A-10s, B-52s and two drones carried out 31 airstrikes, which destroyed two more truck bombs, and together the coalition forces repelled the attack. The battle continued for another 12 hours, in total; 58 militants were killed, three mortars and 20 of their vehicles were destroyed, Peshmerga forces captured at least three US-made Humvees that ISIL had itself captured from the Iraqi military in 2014. Special Warfare Operator 1st Class <b>Charles</b> <b>Keating</b> IV; a U.S. Navy SEAL who was part of the QRF, was struck by direct ISIL small arms fire at 9:32am, he was medevaced to a medical facility in Erbil where he later died of his wound, making him the third American serviceman to be killed in combat during Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq. 10 Peshmerga fighters were also killed and a further 30 wounded, two U.S. medevac helicopters were also damaged by small arms fire. The Islamic State attack was part of their counter-offensive on multiple fronts overnight to obtain new ground. Near Tel Skuf, ISIL covertly assembled their forces and attacked before 6am into Kurdish territory, destroying a Peshmerga checkpoint on the way to Tel Skuf. Iraqi military sources said that special forces had foiled an attack by five suicide bombers in the village of Khirbirdan, and Peshmerga forces repelled an Islamic State assault on Wardak. Coalition aircraft carried out seven airstrikes near Mosul, hitting six groups of ISIL fighters as well as two vehicles, three weapons caches, a mortar system and other targets. U.S. Army Colonel Steve Warren labeled the offensive {{as one of the most}} complex battlefield operations launched by ISIL since December 2015.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, he {{presided over}} the trial of {{financier}} <b>Charles</b> H. <b>Keating</b> Jr. Keating's ensuing ten-year sentence was later overturned on appeal because Ito had neglected to instruct the jury to determine whether Keating intended to defraud investors.

25|$|On November 17, 1989, the Senate Ethics Committee {{investigation}} began of the Keating Five, Alan Cranston (D–CA), Dennis DeConcini (D–AZ), John Glenn (D–OH), John McCain (R–AZ), and Donald W.

500|$|To {{say that}} <b>Charles</b> <b>Keating</b> {{is a complex}} man seems a gross understatement. Some see him as an {{aggressive}} man who got desperate when {{the real estate market}} bottomed out and crossed the line between [...] "business as usual" [...] and fraud. Others see him as a con artist who finally got caught, a hyprocrite who masked his greed with phony piety.|$|E

The association of his name with the scandal made Republicans hopeful that he could be defeated in the 1992 campaign, but Glenn defeated lieutenant governor Mike DeWine to retain his seat.|$|E
500|$|Having {{moved to}} Phoenix in March 1981, McCain {{went to work}} for Hensley & Co., his new {{father-in-law}} Jim Hensley's large Anheuser-Busch beer distributorship, as Vice President of Public Relations.

[...] In carrying out his job, he was able to gain political support among the local business community, meeting powerful figures such as banker <b>Charles</b> <b>Keating,</b> Jr., real estate developer Fife Symington III, newspaper publisher Darrow [...] "Duke" [...] Tully, and locally-well-known auto dealer Lou Grubb, all the while looking for an electoral opportunity.|$|E

500|$|By November 1989, the {{estimated}} cost of the overall {{savings and loan crisis}} had reached $500 billion, and the media's coverage often highlighted Keating's role as part of what became a feeding frenzy.
