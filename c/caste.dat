5|$|In {{stories of}} higher <b>caste</b> Hindus (especially Brahmins), Nandanar is a Brahmin or God himself somehow {{trapped in the}} body of an {{untouchable}} and whose true form is revealed by the fire trial.

5|$|Most {{information}} on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The Hindu <b>caste</b> system was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each <b>caste</b> represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set {{the rules and regulations}} that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. Untouchability was part of the <b>caste</b> system and these communities were represented by leaders (Kaivadadavaru). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The <b>caste</b> system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the <b>caste</b> system, Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect. With {{the exception of a few}} who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as Molla and Kanakadasa) and their works (including those of Vemana and Sarvajna) is an indication of the degree of social fluidity in the society.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{felt that}} {{a small number of}} cunning people created <b>caste</b> distinctions to {{dominate}} over society, so he emphasised that individuals must first develop self-respect and learn to analyse propositions rationally. According to Periyar, a self-respecting rationalist would readily realise that <b>caste</b> system had been stifling self-respect and therefore he or she would strive {{to get rid of this}} menace.|$|E

5|$|By the 9th century, kings {{from all}} the four <b>castes</b> had {{occupied}} the highest seat in the monarchical system in Hindu India. Admitting Kshatriyas to Vedic schools along with Brahmins was customary, but {{the children of the}} Vaishya and Shudra <b>castes</b> were not allowed. Landownership by people of all <b>castes</b> is recorded in inscriptions Intercaste marriages in the higher <b>castes</b> were only between highly placed Kshatriya girls and Brahmin boys, but was relatively frequent among other <b>castes.</b> Intercaste functions were rare and dining together between people of various <b>castes</b> was avoided.|$|R
5|$|Protoss {{society is}} shown in the {{background}} of the series to have been tribal with a strong warrior culture, until a planet-wide civil war allowed a mystic, Khas, to access a natural psionic link shared by all Protoss. Khas' discovery and teachings, labelled the Khala, are then used as a base for a new caste-based society. The Judicator <b>caste</b> forms the Conclave, the ruling body of the Khalai Protoss. The Templar <b>caste</b> constitutes the military, and the Khalai <b>caste</b> includes all other Protoss. The player controls a Templar character in the Protoss campaigns of all the video games to date. Khalai Protoss society is depicted as collectivism, being stubbornly conservative while maintaining the warrior culture and honor values of the tribal system.|$|E
5|$|Ravalomanana's family origins are Merina, the island's {{largest and}} most {{politically}} prominent ethnic group. The Ravalomanana family tomb is outside the historic walls of the village, a placement that would typically indicate the family's origins lie with the hova (commoners' <b>caste),</b> rather than the andriana — the traditional ruling <b>caste</b> among the Merina that continues to exert considerable influence over political affairs in modern Madagascar. His later entry into the political sphere has made the question of his <b>caste</b> background one of popular interest and ongoing debate among the Malagasy public and press. Biographer Vivier (2007) maintains that the Ravalomanana family is andriana in origin.|$|E
5|$|The Deshasthas are {{historically}} an endogamous and monogamous {{community for}} whom marriages take place by negotiation. The Mangalsutra is {{the symbol of}} marriage for the woman.

50|$|Upon {{independence}} from Britain, the Indian Constitution listed 1,108 <b>castes</b> {{across the country}} as Scheduled <b>Castes</b> in 1950, for positive discrimination. The Untouchable communities are sometimes called Scheduled <b>Castes,</b> Dalit or Harijan in contemporary literature. In 2001, Dalits were 16.2% of India's population.

5|$|The Mangalorean Catholics {{constituted}} {{a small community}} widely scattered across the South Canara district. Rather than being a closely knit and united group, the Goan Catholic immigrants and their progeny did not associate with the native Catholics on account of <b>caste,</b> origin, and language, and even among themselves were strongly divided by <b>caste.</b> The Hindus, including the indigenous Brahmins (mostly belonging to the Shivalli, Havyaka, and Kota sub-groups) and Bunts did not associate with the Catholics and would not admit them into their houses on account of their religion. However, a close contact was kept by the Catholics with the Hindus of the same <b>caste</b> who were refugees from Goa. Catholics would invite their Hindu cousins to festivities such as birth celebrations, weddings, and funeral feasts. The Hindus accepted such invitations. Unlike his Hindu counterpart, a high-caste Mangalorean Catholic did not consider himself polluted upon physical contact {{with a member of}} the lower <b>caste,</b> but members of different castes did not fraternise or invite each other home for dinner.|$|E
5|$|The <b>caste</b> {{structure}} of the majority Sinhalese has also accommodated Hindu immigrants from South India since the 13th century CE.

5|$|Worker {{termites}} {{undertake the}} most labour within the colony, {{being responsible for}} foraging, food storage, and brood and nest maintenance. Workers are tasked with the digestion of cellulose in food and are thus the most likely <b>caste</b> {{to be found in}} infested wood. The process of worker termites feeding other nestmates is known as trophallaxis. Trophallaxis is an effective nutritional tactic to convert and recycle nitrogenous components. It frees the parents from feeding all but the first generation of offspring, allowing for the group to grow much larger and ensuring that the necessary gut symbionts are transferred from one generation to another. Some termite species do not have a true worker <b>caste,</b> instead relying on nymphs that perform the same work without differentiating as a separate <b>caste.</b>|$|E
50|$|According to Ramaswamy, Sali weavers {{were always}} part of right hand <b>castes</b> while Devanga and Kaikkolar {{were part of}} left hand <b>castes.</b> But in Kerala, Sali or Chaliyans {{themselves}} divided into both right hand and left hand <b>castes.</b>|$|R

It was also unclear as to which <b>castes</b> constituted each faction. Some <b>castes</b> considered to be left-handed in some areas were regarded as right-handed in others and vice versa. Roughly speaking,the Valangai or right-handed faction was made up of <b>castes</b> with an agricultural basis while the Idangai was made of metal workers, weavers, etc. i.e. <b>castes</b> involved in manufacturing.|$|R

5|$|By {{virtue of}} a Hindu belief that {{killing of a}} brahmin (Bramhatya) was a sin, capital {{punishment}} was not applicable to them. Upper <b>caste</b> kshatriyas (satkshatriya) were also exempt from capital punishment due to their higher position in the <b>caste</b> system. Severe crimes committed were punishable by the severing of a foot or hand. Contemporary literary sources reveal up to ten castes in the Hindu <b>caste</b> system; three among kshatriya, three among brahmin, two among vaishya and two among shudras. Family laws permitted a wife or daughter or surviving relatives of a deceased person to claim properties such as his home, land, grain, money etc. {{if there were no}} male heirs. If no claimants to the property existed, the state took possession of these properties as Dharmadeya (charitable asset). Intercaste marriage, child marriage, marriage of a boy to maternal uncles daughter, Svayamvara marriage (where the bride garlands her choice of a groom from among many aspirants) were all in vogue. Memorials containing hero stones (virkal) were erected for fallen heroes and the concerned family received monetary aid for maintenance of the memorial.|$|E
5|$|Chronicles mention more castes {{than the}} four {{commonly}} known castes in the Hindu social system, some {{as many as}} seven castes. One traveller's account mentions sixteen castes including the four basic castes of Brahmins, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Sudras. The Zakaya or Lahud <b>caste</b> consisted of communities specialising in dance and acrobatics. People in the professions of sailing, hunting, weaving, cobblery, basket making and fishing belonged to specific castes or subcastes. The Antyajas <b>caste</b> provided many menial services to the wealthy. Brahmins enjoyed the highest status in Rashtrakuta society; only those Kshatriyas in the Sat-Kshatriya sub-caste (noble Kshatriyas) were higher in status.|$|E

The table below illustrate some alternate terms for <b>castes</b> mirroring the Somali Madhiban in other ethnic groups that share this region with the Somali people.
