50|$|An early disk {{cartridge}} {{was a single}} hard disk platter encased in a protective plastic shell. When the removable cartridge was inserted into the <b>cartridge</b> <b>drive</b> peripheral device, the read/write heads of the drive could access the magnetic data storage surface of the platter through holes in the shell. The {{disk cartridge}} was a direct evolution from the disk pack drive, or the early hard drive. As the storage density improved, even a single platter would provide a useful amount of data storage space, with the benefit being easier to handle than a removable disk pack. An example of a <b>cartridge</b> <b>drive</b> is the IBM 2310, used on the IBM 1130. Disk cartridges were made obsolete by floppy disks.|$|E

5000|$|The IBM 2310 Removable <b>Cartridge</b> <b>Drive</b> was {{announced}} in 1964 with the IBM 1800, and then in 1965 with the IBM 1130; it likely first shipped with the 1130 in late 1965. It could store 512,000 16-bit words (1,024,000 bytes) per side on an IBM 2315 cartridge. A single 14 in oxide-coated aluminum disk spun in a plastic shell with openings for the read/write arm and two heads.|$|E
40|$|Within the {{established}} low cost structure of Data <b>Cartridge</b> <b>drive</b> technology, {{it is possible}} to achieve nearly 1 terrabyte (10 (exp 12)) of data capacity and more than 1 Gbit/sec (greater than 100 Mbytes/sec) transfer rates. The desirability to place this capability within a single cartridge will be determined by the market. The 3. 5 in. or smaller form factor may suffice to serve both the current Data Cartridge market and a high performance segment. In any case, Data Cartridge Technology provides a strong sustainable technology growth path in the 21 st century...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Document Image Understanding {{encompasses}} the technology {{required to make}} paper documents equivalent to other computer exchange media like floppies, tapes, and cdroms. The physical reader of the paper document is the scanner just like the physical reader of the floppy is the floppy drive and the physical reader of the tape cartridge is the tape <b>cartridge</b> <b>drive,</b> and the physical reader of the cdrom is the cdrom drive. But document image understanding can involve more than just reading the character strings on a paper document and putting them in a format of our favorite word processing system. For documents have on them information just like floppies have information. But the information on a floppy is relatively simple. Its structure is typically just a set of files. But paper documents {{have a much more}} complicated structure. For example a business letter has a sender's address, a receiver's address, a date, an opening salutation, a body, a closing, and a signatu...|$|E

50|$|Most older {{samplers}} use SCSI as {{the protocol}} for getting sample data {{in and out}} of the machine. SCSI interfaces were either standard on the sampler or offered as an option. SCSI provides the ability to move large quantities of data {{in and out of}} a sampler in reasonable times. Hard drives, CDROM drives, Zip <b>drives</b> and removable <b>cartridge</b> <b>drives</b> such as Syquest and Iomega Jaz drives are the most popular SCSI devices used with samplers. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, with hard drives being the fastest devices. Modern (after 2000) samplers use solid-state memory cards (such as compact Flash or SmartMedia) for sample storage and transfer.|$|R
40|$|Many of {{the recent}} {{improvements}} in the capacity of data cartridge systems have been achieved {{through the use of}} narrower tracks, higher linear densities and continuous servo tracking with multi-channel heads. These changes have produced new tribological problems at the head/tape interface. It is crucial that the tribology of such systems is understood and this will continue since increasing storage capacities and faster transfer rates are constantly being sought. Chemical changes in the surface of single and dual layer MP tape have been correlated to signal performance. An accelerated tape tester, consisting of a custom made cycler ("loop tester"), was used to ascertain if results could be produced that were representative of a real tape drive system. A second set of experiments used a modified tape drive (Georgens cycler), which allowed the effects of the tape transport system on the tape surface to be studied. To isolate any effects on the tape surface due to the head/tape interface, read/write heads were not fitted to the cycler. Two further sets of experiments were conducted which included a head in the tape path. This allowed the effects of the head/tape interface on the physical and chemical properties of the head and tape surfaces to be investigated. It was during the final set of experiments that the effect on the head/tape interface, of an energised MR element, was investigated. The effect of operating each cycler at extreme relative humidity and temperature was investigated through the use of an environmental chamber. Extensive use was made of surface specific analytical techniques such as XPS, AFM, AES, and SEM to study the physical and chemical changes that occur at the head/tape interface. Results showed that cycling improved the signal performance of all the tapes tested. The data <b>cartridge</b> <b>drive</b> belt had an effect on the chemical properties of the tape surface on which it was in contact. Also binder degradation occurred for each tape and appeared to be greater at higher humidity. Lubricant was generally seen to migrate to the tape surface with cycling. Any surface changes likely to affect signal output occurred at the head surface rather than the tape...|$|E
5000|$|A {{peripheral}} from Sinclair Research for its ZX Spectrum home computer, the ZX Interface 1 {{was launched}} in 1983. Originally intended as a local area network interface for use in school classrooms, it was revised before launch to also act as the controller for up to eight ZX Microdrive high-speed tape-loop <b>cartridge</b> <b>drives.</b> It also included a DE-9 RS-232 interface capable of operating at up to 19.2 kbit/s [...] - [...] a rare instance of Sinclair using an industry-standard connector. At hardware level it was mainly a voltage adapter, the serial protocol being implemented in software by bit-banging. This led to problems when receiving data, but not when transmitting.|$|R

50|$|The Steyr M {{series of}} pistols employs the {{mechanically}} locked Browning short recoil {{method of operation}} with a linkless, vertically dropping barrel. The cold-hammer-forged conventional rifled barrel is locked to the slide {{by means of a}} single rectangular lug around the barrel chamber that recesses into the ejection port in the slide. When fired, the recoil impulse from the ignited <b>cartridge</b> <b>drives</b> the barrel and slide back, locked together until the bullet leaves the barrel and pressures drop to a safe level. A locking block integrated into the frame then engages a lug {{at the base of the}} chamber and drives the barrel downward, separating it from the slide and terminating any further rearward movement while the slide continues back in a straight line.|$|R
5000|$|From 1958 onwards, the {{so-called}} [...] "direct-acting" [...] tools have been quickly replaced by [...] "indirect-acting" [...] tools. In the former type, the combustion gases from a blank powder <b>cartridge</b> directly <b>drive</b> the fastener {{into the base}} material. The nail can reach velocities of hundreds of meters per second making it a highly dangerous projectile.|$|R
50|$|Later {{documentation}} {{shows that}} a 13- or 19-inch color display was available. The color frame buffer had a resolution of 640×512 pixels, with 640×480 displayed on the monitor. The board could display 256 colors from a palette of 16 million. ½-inch 9-track reel-to-reel tape drives and QIC-02 ¼-inch <b>cartridge</b> tape <b>drives</b> were also added to the offering.|$|R

50|$|Programming of this {{minicomputer}} was via assembler language. It was {{not object}} code compatible with anything else {{and so had}} limited tool support. Imlac eventually added a self-hosted Fortran compiler (using an interpreter?) with hour-long compiles due to the cramped memory. Some PDS models had an optional IBM 2310 <b>cartridge</b> disk <b>drive</b> or 8-inch floppy drive. These ran a rudimentary disk OS supporting program overlays. The disks were dropped from later products.|$|R

50|$|The I/O systems {{underwent}} huge {{changes during}} the PDP-8 era. Early PDP-8 models used a front panel interface, a paper-tape reader and a teletype printer with an optional paper-tape punch. Over time I/O {{systems such as}} magnetic tape, RS-232 and current loop dumb terminals, punched card readers, and fixed-head disks were added. Toward {{the end of the}} PDP-8 era, floppy disks and moving-head <b>cartridge</b> disk <b>drives</b> were popular I/O devices. Modern enthusiasts have created standard PC style IDE hard disk adapters for real and simulated PDP-8 computers.|$|R
40|$|Spectrum. The QL, {{based on}} the Motorola 68008 microprocessor, was aimed at the {{hobbyist}} and small business markets, but failed to achieve commercial success. Description The QL was originally conceived in 1981 under the code-name ZX 83, as a portable computer for business users, with a built-in ultra-thin flat-screen CRT display (similar to the later TV 80 pocket TV), printer and modem. As development progressed, and ZX 83 became ZX 84, it eventually {{became clear that the}} portability features were over-ambitious and the specification was reduced to a conventional desktop configuration. 1 2 It was designed to be more powerful than the IBM Personal Computer, and comparable to Apple's Macintosh. 3 Based on a Motorola 68008 processor clocked at 7. 5 MHz, the QL included 128 kB of RAM (officially expandable to 640 kB) and could be connected to a monitor or TV for display. 4 Two built-in ZX Microdrive tape-loop <b>cartridge</b> <b>drives</b> provided mass storage, in place of the more expensive floppy disk drives found on similar systems of the era. Microdrives had been introduced for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum in July 1983, although the QL used a different logical tape format. Interfaces included an expansion slot, ROM cartridg...|$|R
50|$|The HP2644A {{introduced}} 3M mini <b>cartridge</b> tape <b>drives</b> {{which could}} be used to upload or download data, as opposed to slow paper tapes of the time. Another later model used floppy disks, and supported drawing forms etch-a-sketch style and would compute intersections. Also notable was the use of paper labeled function keys on the upper left. These would always get lost, so users would scroll lock the top 2 lines of the screen and used these for labels. These were built into the next generation of terminals. The values of these keys could be programmed.|$|R
50|$|A {{prototype}} {{development of the}} 3.7-inch gun using the QF 4.5-inch naval gun Mk V barrel with a liner to give a gun using a 4.45 in size <b>cartridge</b> case to <b>drive</b> the 3.7 in shell. The barrel wear proved excessive and it was dropped in favour of the Mk VI.|$|R
50|$|With a {{malfunctioning}} <b>drive</b> or <b>cartridge,</b> the <b>drive</b> heads {{tried to}} read the Zip disk, but {{could not find a}} good Z track or hit a bad spot during a read operation. As part of the drive's retry program, the controller would quickly snap the head arm back into the drive and out again, producing a specific number of 'clicks'. This happens each time a data request fails: the drive parks the heads to calibrate them and presumably clean them. Parking and relaunching continued until the data had been read or a set number of attempts had been reached.|$|R
5000|$|The VT100 {{form factor}} left {{significant}} {{room in the}} case for expansion, and DEC used this to produce several all-in-one stand-alone minicomputer systems. The VT103 included a cardcage and 4&times;4 (8-slot) Q-Bus backplane, sufficient to configure a small LSI-11 system within the case, and supported an optional dual TU58 DECtape II block addressable <b>cartridge</b> tape <b>drive</b> [...] which behaves like a very slow disk drive. The VT180 (codenamed [...] "Robin") added a single-board microcomputer using a Zilog Z80 to run CP/M. The VT278 (DECmate) added a PDP-8 processor, allowing the terminal to run Digital's WPS-8 word processing software.|$|R
50|$|Tolerance {{rings are}} used in hard disk drives (HDD) to mount disks or bearing <b>cartridges</b> into the <b>drives.</b> The waves on their outer surface allow them to absorb excess {{vibration}} to reduce torque ripple effect and resonance to improve the HDD’s performance.

These students use portable computers (Macintosh PowerBook 170 s connected to a removable <b>cartridge</b> hard <b>drive</b> and CD-ROM drive) to do the patient workups. The PowerBook 170 contains the automated medical record entry software (IMR-E), five expert system software packages, and a program that allows the PowerBook to emulate a PC-compatible computer. With this configuration the student has a portable system that allows {{for the creation of a}} computerized medical record at the patient's bedside, along with the ability to analyze the data and generate a list of differential diagnoses...|$|R
50|$|Based on a Motorola 68008 {{processor}} clocked at 7.5 MHz, the QL included 128 kB of RAM (officially expandable to 640 kB; in practice, 896 kB) {{and could}} be connected to a monitor or TV for display. Two built-in Microdrive tape-loop <b>cartridge</b> <b>drives</b> provided mass storage, {{in place of the}} more expensive floppy disk drives found on similar systems of the era. (Microdrives had been introduced for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum in July 1983, although the QL used a different logical tape format.) Interfaces included an expansion slot, ROM cartridge socket, dual RS-232 ports, proprietary QLAN local area network ports, dual joystick ports and an external Microdrive bus. Two video modes were available, 256×256 pixels with 8 RGB colours and per-pixel flashing, or 512×256 pixels with four colours (black, red, green and white), they being allowed to be stippled in 2x2 blocks to simulate up to 256 colours (an effect which did not copy reliably on a TV, especially over an RF connection). Both screen modes used a 32 kB framebuffer in main memory. The hardware is capable of switching between two different areas of memory for the framebuffer, thus allowing double buffering. However, this would have used 64 KB of the standard machine's 128 kB of RAM and there is no support for this feature in the QL's original firmware. The alternative and much improved operating system Minerva does provide full support for the second framebuffer. When connected to a normally-adjusted TV or monitor, the QL's video output would overscan horizontally. This was reputed to have been due to the timing constants in the ZX8301 chip being optimised for the flat-screen CRT display originally intended for the QL.|$|R
50|$|The {{motherboard}} {{includes a}} 16 bit ISA slot {{connected to a}} riser card, providing a total of two 16 bit ISA slots. One of these slots is populated with an ISA card, which provides connections for sound {{at the rear of}} the machine and a connection for the Mega <b>Drive</b> <b>cartridge</b> at the front. The other slot was left free for expansion (such as the addition of a modem or Network Interface Card).|$|R
