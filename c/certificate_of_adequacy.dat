40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to expand the {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> by adding soft skills as a measure of school productivity. The singular focus on academic standards inherent in education policy has prevented scholars from seeing the concept <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> through myriad perspectives and has contributed to a resegregation of schools. Education policy includes legal, historical, and political perspectives; research inquiries must accommodate these multiple foci. This study made use of multifocal analysis to investigate the development of the concept <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> in South Carolina. Conclusions suggest an expanded definition <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> has potential for addressing school financing policy, but also for making historical, political and legal contributions to educational and economic policies aimed at repurposing schools...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study is to validate dietary diversity score (DDS) as an indicator <b>of</b> nutrient <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> diet of Indian rural children aged five to eight years. Design/methodology/approach – A cross-sectional survey among 232 children (five to eight years) was conducted using a 24 ?h recall. Food variety score (FVS) and DDSs were calculated. Probability <b>of</b> <b>adequacies</b> <b>of</b> vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron and zinc, and mean probability <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> was used to assess nutrient adequacy. To determine associations between dietary diversity and nutrient adequacy, nutrient adequacy and socio-economic status (SES), partial rank correlations were conducted. Findings – Vitamin C and iron had the lowest probability <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> (PA) while vitamin A and zinc had the highest PA. Mean probability of adequate micronutrient intake (MPA) across five micronutrients was 40 percent. Mean DDS was 6. 5 and mean FVS was 12. 2. DDS was significantly correlated (p...|$|R
