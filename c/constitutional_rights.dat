5|$|After its {{ratification}} of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865, the South Carolina legislature immediately began to legislate Black Codes.

5|$|Finally, Kirby also {{suggested}} that there was much scope for expanding {{the reach of the}} limitations on legislative and executive power imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, argued that this ought to extend to the protection of due process rights as implicit <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights,</b> {{in the absence of an}} explicit bill of rights.|$|E

In 1864, he opposed a constitutional amendment aimed at freeing the slaves.|$|E
5|$|Heffernan v. City of Paterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case in 2016 {{concerning}} the First Amendment rights of public employees.

5|$|Republicans portrayed slavery as uncivilized {{and argued}} for {{abolition}} {{as a necessary}} step in national progress. Amendment supporters also argued that the slave system had negative effects on white people. These included the lower wages resulting from competition with forced labor, as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South. Advocates said ending slavery would restore the First Amendment and other <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> violated by censorship and intimidation in slave states.|$|E

5|$|Singapore's {{political}} {{model has}} been described as a representative democracy, and Singaporeans have <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> to freedom of speech and assembly under Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. The <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> to free speech and assembly extend only to Singapore citizens. Hence, the Singapore Court of Appeal has held that non-citizens enjoy only common law free speech. Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) are then subject to Articles 14(2)(a) and (b) which allow Parliament to impose, by law, restrictions on the rights to freedom of speech and assembly. The grounds for restrictions are, for freedom of speech, Singapore's security, friendly relations with other states, public order, public morality, protecting parliamentary privilege, defamation, contempt of court and incitement to any criminal offence; and for freedom of assembly, public order only. These restrictions made it a lengthy and difficult process to obtain the licence required to address a public gathering.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm, {{officials}} in Honduras requested international assistance, which totaled $2.8billion over a several year period.

Officials enacted a widespread curfew following the storm, and for 15days temporarily restricted <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> to maintain order. There were outbreaks in various diseases, and many residents faced food and water shortages. Due to the heavy damage, the name Mitch was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming list.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that {{there exists a}} problem if a {{government}} minister simply needs to state that a national security interest {{is involved in a}} matter, upon which the rules of natural justice are immediately compromised.

5|$|A {{state may}} place {{the burden on}} the {{defendant}} has to prove incompetence by the preponderance of the evidence, but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as clear and convincing evidence.

The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|Although Morton {{was able}} to keep the state united during {{the first phase of the}} war, once {{emancipation}} became an issue in 1862, the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize control of the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of the war, and the issues of emancipation and the loss of <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights,</b> among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.|$|E

The case arose when Simon Glik, a private citizen, filmed Boston, Massachusetts, police officers making an arrest in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording the arrest, they arrested him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner.

5|$|In the 1870s, white Democrats wrested {{power back}} in the state {{legislature}} from the biracial coalition at the end of Reconstruction. In the early 20th century, the legislature passed bills to impose poll taxes, followed by white primaries; these measures effectively disfranchised most blacks, poor whites and Mexican Americans. In the 1890s, 100,000 blacks voted in the state; by 1906, only 5,000 could vote. As a result, the Democratic Party dominated Texas politics from the turn of the century, imposing racial segregation and white supremacy. It held power until after passage in the mid-1960s of national civil rights legislation enforcing <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> of all citizens.|$|E
5|$|In the storm's {{immediate}} aftermath, officials {{enacted a}} widespread curfew after reports of looting and vandalism. The government temporarily restricted <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> for 15days. Officials urged residents to restrict water and fuel use, and alcohol sales were halted. The widespread flooding and the crippled infrastructure forced officials {{to rely on}} a limited number of helicopters to operate search and rescue missions and deliver supplies. A helicopter carrying fourpeople, including Tegucigalpa mayor and potential presidential candidate César Castellanos, crashed on November1 while touring flood damage, killing everyone aboard. In some areas, residents did not receive assistance until November12, more than two weeks after Mitch's landfall. About 285,000people remained in 1,375shelters, many of them schools, by three weeks after the hurricane struck. Some sports stadiums and churches were also used as makeshift shelters. Overcrowding at shelters caused various diseases.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} it can judicially review the {{exercise}} of prosecutorial power and declare a prosecution to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power, for example, if a prosecution is brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an accused person for an offence he or she committed. A prosecution {{can also be found}} to have infringed the accused person's <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights.</b> This may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes, and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the accused persons but not the officers, as this may infringe the accused persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
