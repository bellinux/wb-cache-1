5|$|In general, common ravens {{live in a}} {{wide array}} of environments but prefer heavily {{contoured}} landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as <b>corticosterone</b> is activated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. <b>Corticosterone</b> is activated when the bird is exposed to stress, such as migrating great distances.|$|E
5|$|Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, {{can detect}} the {{changing}} levels of cortisol and <b>corticosterone</b> hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make {{their way back to}} the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels' {{response}} to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of <b>corticosterone</b> (CORT,) a hormone {{produced by the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions. Extended periods of elevated blood CORT levels may direct metabolic energy away from growth and reproduction. Thus, high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding American kestrel nests are found to increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do not typically experience a higher stress {{response to}} environmental human disturbance, suggesting that they can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near the nest.|$|E
5|$|Cortisol is {{the main}} {{glucocorticoid}} in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by <b>corticosterone</b> instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This {{is the result of}} an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Female {{elephants}} {{spend their}} entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, {{some of which are}} made up of more than ten members, including three pairs of mothers with offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal <b>corticosterone</b> ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision-makers.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} {{produces}} three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) {{produced in the}} zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The glucocorticoids cortisol and <b>corticosterone</b> are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs. The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes {{that take place in}} cortical cells. The medulla produces the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoid hormones have an {{important}} role in regulating aggressive behavior. In adult rats, acute injections of <b>corticosterone</b> promote aggressive behavior and acute reduction of <b>corticosterone</b> decreases aggression; however, a chronic reduction of <b>corticosterone</b> levels can produce abnormally aggressive behavior. In addition, glucocorticoids affect development of aggression and establishment of social hierarchies. Adult mice with low baseline levels of <b>corticosterone</b> are more likely to become dominant than are mice with high baseline <b>corticosterone</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|Although {{production}} of cortisol is inefficient enough to normalize ACTH, the 50-100-fold elevations of <b>corticosterone</b> have enough weak glucocorticoid activity to prevent glucocorticoid deficiency and adrenal crisis.|$|E
25|$|High-potassium media (which stimulates {{aldosterone}} secretion in vitro) also stimulate cortisol secretion {{from the}} fasciculata zone of canine adrenals — unlike <b>corticosterone,</b> upon which potassium has no effect.|$|E
25|$|A sodium load augments {{the intense}} {{potassium}} excretion by cortisol. <b>Corticosterone</b> {{is comparable to}} cortisol in this case. For potassium {{to move out of}} the cell, cortisol moves an equal number of sodium ions into the cell. This should make pH regulation much easier (unlike the normal potassium-deficiency situation, in which two sodium ions move in for each three potassium ions that move out—closer to the deoxycorticosterone effect).|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 2011 that a link between severe pain, neuroinflammation and alarm pheromones release in rats was found: real time RT-PCR {{analysis}} of rat brain tissues indicated that shocking the footpad of a rat increased its production of proinflammatory cytokines in deep brain structures, namely of IL-1β, heteronuclear Corticotropin-releasing hormone and c-fos mRNA expressions in both the paraventricular nucleus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and it increased stress hormone levels in plasma (<b>corticosterone).</b>|$|E
25|$|Though IL-1 {{is useful}} in combating some diseases, {{endotoxic}} bacteria have gained an advantage by forcing the hypothalamus to increase cortisol levels (forcing the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone, thus antagonizing IL-1). The suppressor cells are not affected by glucosteroid response-modifying factor, so the effective setpoint for the immune cells may be even higher than the setpoint for physiological processes (reflecting leukocyte redistribution to lymph nodes, bone marrow, and skin). Rapid administration of <b>corticosterone</b> (the endogenous type I and type II receptor agonist) or RU28362 (a specific type II receptor agonist) to adrenalectomized animals induced changes in leukocyte distribution. Natural killer cells are affected by cortisol.|$|E
25|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} is {{hyperplastic}} and overstimulated, with no impairment of the mineralocorticoid pathway. Consequently, levels of DOC, <b>corticosterone,</b> and 18-deoxycorticosterone are elevated. Although these precursors of aldosterone are weaker mineralocorticoids, the extreme elevations usually provide enough volume expansion, blood pressure elevation, and potassium depletion to suppress renin and aldosterone production. Some persons with 17α-hydroxylase deficiency develop hypertension in infancy, and nearly 90% {{do so by}} late childhood. The low-renin hypertension is often accompanied by hypokalemia due to urinary potassium wasting and metabolic alkalosis. These features of mineralocorticoid excess are the major clinical clue distinguishing the more complete 17α-hydroxylase deficiency from the 17,20-lyase deficiency, which only affects the sex steroids. Treatment with glucocorticoid suppresses ACTH, returns mineralocorticoid production toward normal, and lowers blood pressure.|$|E

However, studies show that trimmed poultry's adrenal glands weigh less, and their plasma <b>corticosterone</b> levels are lower than those found in untrimmed poultry, indicating that they are less stressed overall. A similar but separate practice, usually performed by an avian veterinarian or an experienced birdkeeper, involves clipping, filing or sanding the beaks of captive birds for health purposes—in order to correct or temporarily alleviate overgrowths or deformities and better allow the bird to go about its normal feeding and preening activities. [...] "Coping" [...] is the name for this practice amongst raptor keepers.|$|E
2500|$|Aldosterone and <b>corticosterone</b> {{share the}} first part of their biosynthetic pathways. The last parts are {{mediated}} either by the aldosterone synthase (for aldosterone) or by the 11β-hydroxylase (for <b>corticosterone).</b> These enzymes are nearly identical (they share 11β-hydroxylation and 18-hydroxylation functions), but aldosterone synthase is also able to perform an 18-oxidation.

2500|$|Cortisol is {{synthesized}} from cholesterol. Synthesis {{takes place}} in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. (The name cortisol is derived from cortex.) While the adrenal cortex also produces aldosterone (in the zona glomerulosa) and some sex hormones (in the zona reticularis), cortisol is its main secretion in humans and several other species. [...] (However, in cattle, <b>corticosterone</b> levels may approach or exceed cortisol levels.). The medulla of the adrenal gland lies under the cortex, mainly secreting the catecholamines adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) under sympathetic stimulation.|$|E
2500|$|Situated {{between the}} glomerulosa and reticularis, the zona fasciculata is {{responsible}} for producing glucocorticoids, such as 11-deoxycorticosterone, <b>corticosterone,</b> and cortisol in humans. [...] Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid under normal conditions and its actions include mobilization of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, but it does not increase under starvation conditions. [...] Additionally, cortisol enhances the activity of other hormones including glucagon and catecholamines.

2500|$|Since Harlow's {{pioneering}} work on touch research in development, recent work in rats has {{found evidence that}} touch during infancy resulted in a decrease in corticosteroid, a steroid hormone involved in stress, {{and an increase in}} glucocorticoid receptors in many regions of the brain. Schanberg and Field found that even short-term interruption of mother–pup interaction in rats markedly affected several biochemical processes in the developing pup: a reduction in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, a sensitive index of cell growth and differentiation; a reduction in growth hormone release (in all body organs, including the heart and liver, and throughout the brain, including the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem); an increase in <b>corticosterone</b> secretion; and suppressed tissue ODC responsivity to administered growth hormone. Additionally, it was found that animals who are touch-deprived have weakened immune systems. Investigators have measured a direct, positive relationship between the amount of contact and grooming an infant monkey receives during its first six months of life, and its ability to produce antibody titer (IgG and IgM) in response to an antibody challenge (tetanus) at a little over one year of age. Trying to identify a mechanism for the [...] "immunology of touch", some investigators point to modulations of arousal and associated CNS-hormonal activity. Touch deprivation may cause stress-induced activation of the pituitary–adrenal system, which, in turn, leads to increased plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Likewise, researchers suggest, regular and [...] "natural" [...] stimulation of the skin may moderate these pituitary–adrenal responses in a positive and healthful way.|$|E
50|$|With {{emotional}} memories, <b>corticosterone</b> {{is largely}} associated with fear memory recognition. Studies {{have shown that}} when fear memories are reactivated or consolidated, levels of <b>corticosterone</b> increased. The increase in <b>corticosterone</b> is linked to anxiety relief. This finding depends on the time at which the administration of <b>corticosterone</b> took place as compared to when the fear conditioning took place; <b>corticosterone</b> can either facilitate or interrupt conditioned fear. Not only does <b>corticosterone</b> have effects on emotional memories but memory recognition and consolidation as well.|$|E

50|$|<b>Corticosterone</b> both {{inhibits}} {{protein synthesis}} and degrades proteins. Birds with {{increased levels of}} <b>corticosterone</b> will have slower feather growth during their molting period and {{an extended period of}} poor flight. As a result, many birds have reduced levels of <b>corticosterone</b> when they moult so as to prevent the degradation of their new feathers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Corticosterone</b> {{has further}} {{developmental}} effects on birds. Increased levels of <b>corticosterone</b> in chicks leads to increased begging {{for food and}} aggressiveness. In the short term this leads to higher chance of obtaining food, {{but in the long}} term, increased <b>corticosterone</b> in early life compromises the birds cognitive functioning (problem solving, association of visual cue with food, etc.).|$|E
50|$|With {{respect to}} {{recognition}} {{and long term}} memories, <b>corticosterone</b> has variable effects. Studies show that the modification of certain chemical and brain processes that affect <b>corticosterone</b> levels can also impact stress effects on memory. In studies on rats, the fluctuations of <b>corticosterone</b> concentration are shown to prevent stress’ impairment of recognition memory in lower amounts. These lower levels seem {{to be linked to}} the rescue of stress-induced attenuation of CA1 long-term potentiation. When researchers looked at stress effects on LTM, they found many outcomes. In multiple studies, the formation of LTM (tested 24 h later) was found to be enhanced by <b>corticosterone</b> in some studies, while the persistence of LTM (tested at least 1 wk later) was only assisted by <b>corticosterone</b> in the late phase of memory consolidation and reconsolidation. Stress facilitates the consolidation but disrupts the reconsolidation of emotional memory. As mentioned previously, the persistence of LTM is selectively enhanced when stress and <b>corticosterone</b> are administered during the late phase after acquisition, but it is disrupted when stress and <b>corticosterone</b> are administered during the late phase after retrieval of memory. With regards to the persistence of LTM, there is a restricted time window between acquisition or retrieval where persistence is affected. These studies found that while persistence of LTM is selectively affected based on stage of memory, the formation of LTM is left intact after a certain length of time. Up to this point, studies have not agreed {{as to whether or not}} these processes are dependent on <b>corticosterone</b> or what even happens based on <b>corticosterone</b> in these processes and how memory is ultimately affected.|$|E
50|$|Lack of metabolically active {{aldosterone}} synthase {{leads to}} <b>corticosterone</b> methyl oxidase deficiency type I and II. The deficiency is characterized clinically by salt-wasting, failure to thrive, and growth retardation. The in-active proteins {{are caused by}} the autosomal recessive inheritance of defective CYP11B2 genes in which genetic mutations destroy the enzymatic activity of aldosterone synthase. Deficient aldosterone synthase activity results in impaired biosynthesis of aldosterone while <b>corticosterone</b> in the zona glomerulosa is excessively produced in both <b>corticosterone</b> methyl oxidase deficiency type I and II. The <b>corticosterone</b> methyl oxidase deficiencies both share this effect however type I causes an overall deficiency of 18-hydroxycorticosterone while type II overproduces it.|$|E

50|$|Parental {{response}} to chicks increased begging {{is to increase}} time foraging for food. This leaves the nest of chicks without protection for increased durations of time.

50|$|Studies and {{research}} {{have been done}} on Galápagos marine iguanas that can help and promote conservation efforts to preserve the endemic species. Monitoring levels of marine algae, both dimensionally and hormonally, is {{an effective way to}} predict the fitness of the marine iguana species. Exposure to tourism affects marine iguanas, and <b>corticosterone</b> levels can predict their survival during El Niño events. <b>Corticosterone</b> levels in species measure the stress that they face in their populations. Marine iguanas show higher stress-induced <b>corticosterone</b> concentrations during famine (El Niño) than feast conditions (La Niña). The levels differ between the islands, and show that survival varies throughout them during an El Niño event. The variable response of <b>corticosterone</b> is one indicator of the general public health of the populations of marine iguanas across the Galápagos Islands, which is a useful factor in the conservation of the species.|$|E
