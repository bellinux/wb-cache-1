40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the {{availability}} and productivity of manufacturing systems, process monitoring has become an important matter in modern automated plants. The traditional monitoring technologies are based on single sensors and are insufficient, especially for manufacturing processes of highly complicated and automated systems. Instead, multi-sensor based technologies are developing rapidly and are widely used for such monitoring tasks. This paper introduces a multi-sensor based process monitoring system for an existing <b>machining</b> <b>centre.</b> The system can monitor the major manufacturing process faults or abnormalities of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> and provide maintenance planning through measuring and analysing multiple sensor parameters such as power, vibration, temperature and pressure of spindle, feed axes, and hydraulic and pneumatic systems of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre.</b> The general structure of the monitoring system and {{the implementation of the}} main steps of the monitoring system development are presented in detail...|$|R

40|$|International audienceKey {{performances}} of industrial {{systems can be}} characterised by performances both related to the system itself but also the product/service it is delivering. It can be particularised in the manufacturing domain, by the performances related to the part manufactured (e. g. dimensional deviation, surface roughness) and to the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> (e. g. productivity, availability). The mastering of {{these two types of}} performances is nowadays mostly considerate separately, in the sense that current approaches lead to control product or machine performances mainly in an isolated way. Only few approaches try to take them into account jointly to permit to control {{performances of}} one thanks to the control of performances of the other and this all along the time. Thus a challenge in manufacturing {{is to be able to}} control part deviations from the mastering of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> degradation. In that way, this paper is first proposing a review on current approaches able to support these two performance considerations and then to investigate scientifically, in the frame of automotive sector, a specific approach able to control part performances directly from <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> performance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a simulation study of a typical flexible manufacturing system (FMS) that has routing flexibility. The objective in this study is to test the effectiveness of the modified dissimilarity maximization method (modified DMM) for real time FMS scheduling. modified DMM method is an improvement of the DMM method. Modified DMM method is an alternative process plan selection method developed for routing selection in real time FMS scheduling. A computer simulation model, which mimics a physical system, is used to evaluate the effect of DMM and Modified DMM rules on the system performance. The typical FMS employed in this study includes seven <b>machining</b> <b>centres,</b> a loading and unloading area, and six different part types. The part type has alternative routings because of the existence of identical <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> in the system. The DMM and Modified DMM are used for selecting an incoming part and later routing it to a <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> for its next operation. The result show that the Modified DMM outperforms DMM on system throughput in saturation case, increases utilization of the machines and increases utilization of the handling system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{impeller}} is {{the core}} of aviation engine components, the processing quality has a decisive impact on the performance of the engine. An impeller {{is also one of the}} most important basic components of centrifugal compressor. When a three-axis CNC <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> is used for producing an impeller, great difficulties, i. e. collisions between the cutting tool and the impeller, can occur. As the surface is normally twisted in design to achieve the required performance, it can cause overcut and collision problems during machining. To solve these problems, an integrated five-axis machining approach for a centrifugal impeller by <b>combining</b> related <b>machining</b> technologies is developed. As a result, Cutter Location data based on the geometry model of blade and hub of the impeller are generated. Finally, the Cutter Location data is verified through software simulation.
