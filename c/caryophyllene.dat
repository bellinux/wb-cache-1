5000|$|<b>Caryophyllene</b> {{was shown}} to be {{selective}} agonist of cannabinoid receptor type-2 (CB2) and to exert significant cannabimimetic antiinflammatory effects in mice. Antinociceptive, neuroprotective, anxiolytic and antidepressant [...] and anti-alcoholism [...] activity in in vitro studies and in rodent models have been reported. Whether this compound is able to modulate inflammatory processes in humans via the endocannabinoid system is yet unknown. However, it is found to elicit significant neuroprotection by its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities mediated by activation of the CB2 receptors in rats. <b>Caryophyllene</b> does not bind to the centrally expressed cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1) and therefore does not exert psychoactive effects. However, phytocannabinoid-terpenoid interactions that could produce synergy with respect to treatment of pain, inflammation, depression, anxiety, addiction, epilepsy, cancer, fungal and bacterial infections (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) are found. Scientific evidence have been presented for non-cannabinoid plant components as putative antidotes to intoxicating effects of THC (C21H30O2), that could increase its therapeutic index.|$|E

In addition, the wood is hard, heavy, close-grained, can take a high polish, and repels dry wood termites. Essential oils containing <b>caryophyllene,</b> cadinene, and cadinol are extracted from A. balsamifera and A. elemifera. These are used in varnishes, perfumes, medicines, cosmetics, soaps, and incense.|$|E
5000|$|Sour Diesel is {{a hybrid}} strain of Cannabis sativa. Described as [...] "a cross between {{cannabis}} and caffeine", {{it is known}} for its [...] "uplifting qualities" [...] and its pungent aromas of fuel and citrus. Samples of the strain have tested as high as 30.6% THC, and the strain is also high in the terpenes alpha-Pinene, <b>caryophyllene,</b> and humulene. In 2016 it was the fourth most popular strain in the United States, after Blue Dream, Girl Scout Cookies, and Gorilla Glue #4, {{according to a report by}} the cannabis information site Leafly.
