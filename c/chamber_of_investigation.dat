40|$|The paper {{presents}} results <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>of</b> low-temperature {{sewage sludge}} gasification {{with use of}} flue gas as a gasifying agent. Tests were conducted in a laboratory stand, equipped with a gasification reactor designed and constructed specifically for this purpose. During presented tests, gas mixture with a composition of typical flue gases {{was used as a}} gasifying agent. The measuring system ensures online measurements of syngas composition: CO, CO 2, H 2, CH 4. As a result of gasification process a syngas with combustible components has been obtained. The aim of the research was to determine the usability of sewage sludge for indirect cofiring in power boilers with the use of flue gas from the boiler as a gasifying agent and recirculating the syngas to the boiler’s combustion <b>chamber.</b> Results <b>of</b> presented <b>investigation</b> will be used as a knowledge base for industrial-scale sewage sludge gasification process. Furthermore, toxicity of solid products of the process has been determined by the use of Microtox bioassay. Before tests, solid post-gasification residues have been ground to two particle size fractions and extracted into Milli-Q water. The response of test organisms (bioluminescent Aliivibrio fischeri bacteria) in reference to a control sample (bacteria exposed to 2 % NaCl solution) was measured after 5 and 15 minutes of exposure. The obtained toxicity results proved that thermal treatment of sewage sludge by their gasification reduces their toxicity relative to water organisms...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis of unsteady motions in solid rocket motors has been conducted. A fully coupled implicit {{scheme based on}} a dual time-stepping integration algorithm has been adopted to solve the governing equations and associated boundary conditions. A narrow pressure pulse is imposed at the head end to simulate unsteady acoustic oscillations in the combustion chamber. Pressure increases when {{the front of the}} pulse reaches near the nozzle area. Self-generated oscillations with frequency of standing wave propagates upstream in the combustion <b>chamber.</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>of</b> transient response of gas-phase dynamics to traveling pressure wave and its effects on propellant combustion reveals several aspects: Combustion responses have a strong relationship with vorticity fluctuations in case of high turbulent intensity on the propellant surface. Temperature fluctuations of the propellant surface in the head end region seem to be very unstable and independent of the pressure wave. Surface temperature without turbulence effect looks more sensitive to temperature fluctuations in the primary flame zone. Stability of surface temperature is strongly related to turbulent intensity on the propellant surface...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—High-pressure xenon (HPXe) gas is a {{desirable}} radia-tion detection medium for homeland security applications {{because of its}} good inherent room-temperature energy resolution, potential for large, efficient devices, and stability over a broad temperature range. Past work in HPXe has produced large-diameter gridded ionization chambers with energy resolution at 662 keV between 3. 5 and 4 % FWHM. However, one major limitation of these detec-tors is resolution degradation due to Frisch grid microphonics. A coplanar-anode HPXe detector has been developed as an alterna-tive to gridded <b>chambers.</b> An <b>investigation</b> <b>of</b> this detector’s energy resolution is reported in this submission. A simulation package is used to investigate the contributions of important physical pro-cesses to the measured photopeak broadening. Experimental data is presented for pure Xe and Xe + 0 2 %H 2 mixtures, including an analysis of interaction location effects on the energy spectrum. Index Terms—Coplanar anodes, gas detectors, high-pressure xenon, ionization chambers, position sensing, single-polarity charge sensing. I...|$|R
