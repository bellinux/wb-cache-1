40|$|Long {{hours worked}} in the mining {{industry}} might reflect employee preferences. We analyse quantitative and qualitative data from the mining industry, and relevant literature, and find that employee preferences are for substantially shorter hours than are actually worked. This links to „interference ‟ of work in life, including through lost family time, fatigue, interference with community and sporting activities and, it appears, high labour turnover. Involuntary long hours in mining are related to 24 -hour operations and twelve hour shifts and worsened where employees lack input into the design of rosters. The findings suggest that, {{in order to promote}} „good job ‟ in the mining industry, there is both a need to revisit protections for employees against being forced to work „unreasonable‟ hours above the ostensible national standard of 38 hours per week and strong support even amongst mineworkers for a <b>ceiling</b> on <b>hours</b> worked per week...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the period}} {{after the vote}} had been won there was a decline in social {{feminism}} in the US. According to William O'Neill [...] "Adventure was now to be had, for the most part, in struggling against not social problems but social conventions. Drinking, smoking, dancing, sexual novelties, daring literature and avant-garde art now filled the vacuum created {{by the collapse of}} social feminism."However, Labor feminists continued to agitate for reform in the workplace. Labor feminists did not want to end all distinctions based on sex, only those that hurt women. For example, they felt that state laws that put in place wage floors and <b>hour</b> <b>ceilings</b> benefited women.|$|R
40|$|We study {{variations}} in housework time and leisure consumption when workers {{are subject to}} labor market work hours constraints that prevent them from working the optimal number of hours. Using data from two large nationwide longitudinal surveys, we first document that such constraints are widespread [...] about 50 percent of all households in our sample had been bound by such constraints {{in at least one}} year, highlighting the significance of studying household behaviors in labor markets under binding constraints. Our analysis reveals strong heterogeneity and asymmetry in workers' reactions to this type of market constraint that are difficult to reconcile with standard preferences and home production technology. In particular, we find that the ceilings on market work hours induce workers to increase time spent on housework, including cooking, and to reduce vacation time. In contrast, floors on market work hours do not significantly affect time spent on housework, but may boost vacation time. On net, workers constrained by <b>hours</b> <b>ceilings</b> (floors) appear to have more (less) leisure time. Meanwhile, the response to <b>hours</b> <b>ceilings</b> are more pronounced among unmarried households. We also find some evidence that the magnitude of the effects of market hours constraints increases with the persistence of these constraints. Our results are robust to a number of {{variations in}} measurement metrics, econometric specifications, sample selection criteria, and data sources. We argue that the empirical results documented in this paper can be taken as additional moments conditions against which equilibrium models with home production are calibrated.

2500|$|While some of {{the most}} {{powerful}} people in San Francisco considered the strike's denouement to be a victory for the employers, many longshoremen and seamen did not. Spontaneous strikes over grievances and workplace conditions broke out as strikers returned to their jobs, with longshoremen and teamsters supporting their demands. Employers conceded many of these battles, giving workers even more confidence in demanding that employers lighten unbearably heavy loads. Longshoremen also began dictating other terms, fining members who worked more than the <b>ceiling</b> of 120 <b>hours</b> per month, filing charges against a gang boss for [...] "slandering colored brothers" [...] and forcing employers to fire strikebreakers. Other unions went further: the Marine Firemen proposed to punish any member who bought a Hearst newspaper.|$|R
40|$|Is there a {{job quality}} problem in mining? Is {{part of this}} problem that mining {{employees}} are working involuntary long hours? If so, how extensive is this problem? What is the impact, if any, of involuntary long hours in mining on family life? And how much control do mining employees have over their working time arrangements? What are the possible policy responses? We address these questions through analysis of data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Australian Work and Life Index survey, a survey of employees in Queensland and qualitative interviews with 135 people associated with the Queensland mining industry. We find evidence of substantial involuntary long hours in mining, closely related to 24 -hour operations and twelve hour shifts, with adverse implications for the work-life balance and worsened where employees lack input into the design of rosters. The findings suggest that, {{in order to promote}} 'good jobs' in the mining industry, there is both a need to revisit protections for employees against being forced to work 'unreasonable' hours above the ostensible national standard of 38 hours per week and strong support even amongst mineworkers for a <b>ceiling</b> on <b>hours</b> worked per week.

50|$|After {{gaining the}} right to vote, the National Woman's Party {{proposed}} the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).The ERA was bitterly opposed by the social feminists who saw it as undermining many of the gains they had made {{in the treatment of}} women workers. The charge was led by labor feminists, who were the successors to Progressive Era social feminists. Labor feminists did not want to end all distinctions based on sex, only those that hurt women. For example, they felt that state laws that put in place wage floors and <b>hour</b> <b>ceilings</b> benefited women. Thus, they continued to advocate for protectionist legislation and special benefits for women. In addition to state wage laws, they sought to expand maternity leave, health coverage during childbirth, and disability and unemployment coverage for mothers. Their view was that women had different needs than men and should not be penalized for performing the function of motherhood.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the ideas of}} ?drop ceilings?, that full-time employees who switch to reduced hours thereafter face an <b>hours</b> <b>ceiling</b> such that a return to full-time employment is difficult, and of ?trap-door floors?, that full-time employees may be denied the opportunity to reduce their hours and instead face a choice between full-time employment and quitting the job. These ideas derive from the potential existence of norms around the ideal worker and motherhood. Relevant hypotheses are developed and tested using information on usual and preferred working time from the first two waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. The key findings are that women face drop ceilings significantly more often than men; that professionals and managers confront trap-door floors significantly more often than employees in other occupations; and that trap-door floor effects are generally stronger than drop ceiling effects in the data...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{report on}} doctors' views, from all {{specialty}} backgrounds, about the European Working Time Directive (EWTD) {{and its impact}} on the National Health Service (NHS), senior doctors and junior doctors. Design: All medical school graduates from 1999 to 2000 were surveyed by post and email in 2012. Setting: The UK. Methods: Among other questions, in a multipurpose survey on medical careers and career intentions, doctors were asked to respond to three statements about the EWTD on a five-point scale (from strongly agree to strongly disagree) : 'The implementation of the EWTD has benefited the NHS', 'The implementation of the EWTD has benefited senior doctors' and 'The implementation of the EWTD has benefited junior doctors'. Results: The response rate was 54. 4 % overall (4486 / 8252), 55. 8 % (2256 / 4042) of the 1999 cohort and 53 % (2230 / 4210) of the 2000 cohort. 54. 1 % (2427) of all respondents were women. Only 12 % (498 / 4136 doctors) agreed that the EWTD has benefited the NHS, 9 % (377) that it has benefited senior doctors and 31 % (1289) that it has benefited junior doctors. Doctors' views on EWTD differed significantly by specialty groups: 'craft' specialties such as surgery, requiring extensive experience in performing operations, were particularly critical. Conclusions: These cohorts have experience of working in the NHS before and after the implementation of EWTD. Their lack of support for the EWTD 4 years after its implementation should be a concern. However, it is unclear whether problems rest with the current <b>ceiling</b> on <b>hours</b> worked or with the ways in which EWTD has been implemented...|$|R
40|$|C 1 - Refereed Journal ArticleThere {{is little}} {{evidence}} about the responsiveness of doctors' labour supply to changes in pay. Given substantial increases in NHS expenditure, new national contracts for hospital doctors and general practitioners that involve increases in pay, and the gradual imposition of a <b>ceiling</b> on <b>hours</b> worked through the European Working Time Directive, knowledge {{of the size of}} labour supply elasticities is crucial in examining the effects of these major changes. This paper estimates a modified labour supply model for hospital consultants, using data from a survey of consultants in Scotland. Rigidities in wage setting within the NHS mean that the usual specification of the labour supply model is extended by the inclusion of job quality (job satisfaction) in the equation explaining the optimal number of hours worked. Generalised Method of Moments estimation is used to account for the endogeneity of both earnings and job quality. Our results confirm the importance of pay and non-pay factors on the supply of labour by consultants. The results are sensitive to the exclusion of job quality and show a slight underestimation of the uncompensated earnings elasticity (of 0. 09) without controlling for the effect of job quality, and 0. 12 when we controlled for job quality. Pay increases in the new contract for consultants will only result in small increases in hours worked. Small and non-significant elasticity estimates at higher quantiles in the distribution of hours suggest that any increases in hours worked are more likely for consultants who work part time. Those currently working above the median number of hours are much less responsive to changes in earnings. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|Pro-labor {{groups in}} Hong Kong have been campaigning for a {{standard}} working hours law in Hong Kong. This {{would require that}} employers asking their employees to work over the standard hours pay more for each extra hour worked. The standard hours {{would be the same}} across all industries and occupations. Labor representatives even walked away from the Labour Advisory Board because they said neither the government nor the employer representatives had shown willingness to contemplate legislating standard working hours across the board. I am disappointed that labor groups appear to be more interested in money than in health issues and that they are reluctant to contemplate anything other than what they put on the table. It is true Hong Kong’s working hours are rather long, and that long working hours can harm people’s health and family life. But standard working hours legislation, without a <b>ceiling</b> on the <b>hours</b> worked, will not help. Health and family life may still give way to earnings. This will defeat the purpose of the legislation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{labour market}} {{processes}} in urban India. Investigating large and persistent differentials in urban unemployment rates across the Indian states, {{we find that}} regions with higher wage push or better amenities have higher unemployment rates, controlling for labour force composition. The differentials are maintained by rural-urban migration rather than by barriers to inter-state migration. Our investigation of wage determination yields evidence of imperfect competition in the labour market which is not simply 'institutional'. Indian firms pay efficiency wages which induce sufficient productivity gains to pay for themselves. After identifying the long and short run structural processes in the labour market, we consider recent aggregate trends in India's factory sector. There was negative employment growth in the 1980 s even as output growth touched record levels. Our analysis suggests that this had {{less to do with}} wage growth, as proposed by the World Bank, and more to do with increasing work intensity, encouraged by wage incentives, improved infrastructure and increased competition. Considerable slack was inherited from the past, evidence of which flows from the wage and production function estimates. We find that increased labour utilization raises capacity utilization. This is important because Indian industry has chronically carried large excess capacity. A breakthrough in total factor productivity growth accompanied declining employment in the 1980 s and has been interpreted as the reward of deregulation in this decade. Existing studies mismeasure productivity growth by neglecting labour utilization (hours) and assuming perfectly competitive product markets. We produce new estimates at the aggregate and industry levels. A natural <b>ceiling</b> to <b>hours</b> worked moderates bad news on the employment front and good news on the productivity front. Our analyses are expected to contribute to the evaluation of current and controversial policy changes in India. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the requirements of cardinal temperatures and biological hours for germination of lentil by using different linear and nonlinear regression models. To do this, a split plot experiment based on randomized completely design with four replications was conducted in germinator. Experimental treatments were three lentil cultivars (Gacgsaran, Kimia and Bilehsovar) under seven fixed temperature regimes (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 °C). Beta, Dent-like and Segmented models were applied to evaluate the relationship between germination rate and temperature. Root mean square deviation (RMSD), coefficient of determination (R 2), coefficients of variation (CV (and linear regression coefficients (a, b) were used to detect the perfect model. Results of fitting the models indicated that the response of lentil germination to temperature is best described by a segmented function. Cardinal temperatures estimated by this model were 0. 89 to 1. 23 °C for base temperature, 23. 41 to 26. 94 °C for optimum temperature and 35. 15 to 45 °C for ceiling temperature. Significant difference in base temperature among cultivars was not observed, but cultivars had significant difference in optimum and <b>ceiling</b> temperatures. Biological <b>hour's</b> requirement for germination ranged between 25. 43 to 31. 37 hours. The quantitative information provided by this research {{can be used in}} prediction of germination of lentil cultivars...|$|R
30|$|Most important, {{but outside}} {{employment}} protection legislation, was {{the change in}} the regulation of so-called marginal part-time work in 2003, as part of the Hartz reform package. In contrast to earlier, more restrictive regulation of small part-time jobs, the 2003 reform lifted the earnings threshold to 400  EUR per month (450  EUR as of 2013), abolished the weekly working <b>hours</b> <b>ceiling</b> of 15  h and allowed for marginal part-time work as a second job. What is peculiar about marginal part-time work or Minijobs in Germany is the fact that employment in marginal part-time is not liable for income taxes and employee social insurance contributions {{while at the same time}} not providing full social protection. Hence, earnings from Minijobs can be received without a reduction of taxes and social insurance contributions. But when earning more than 450  EUR (or if combining more than one of these jobs), full taxation and a gradual phase-in into social insurance begin. Therefore, the 450  EUR threshold acts as a strong disincentive to earn or work more. This arrangement, however, is quite attractive and popular with secondary earners such as married women, people with a fully socially protected first job as well as students and pensioners. Not only the expansion of Minijobs has occurred since 2003 but also the further restructuring of some private services, such as retail trade or hotels and restaurants, where most of these jobs are concentrated. There is some evidence that regular part-time and full-time jobs have been crowded out, and employers have reaped part of the benefits on the employee side by reducing gross hourly wages (Eichhorst et al. 2012; Hohendanner and Stegmaier 2012).|$|R
