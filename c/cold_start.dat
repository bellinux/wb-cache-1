5|$|The Brazilian {{subsidiaries}} of Magneti Marelli, Delphi and Bosch {{have developed}} and announced the introduction in 2009 {{of a new}} flex engine generation that {{eliminates the need for}} the secondary gasoline tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting, and allowing flex vehicles to do a normal <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> at temperatures as low as, the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the Brazilian territory. Another improvement is the reduction of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for <b>cold</b> <b>start.</b> The Flex Start system used by the Polo was developed by Bosch.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>Start</b> is a {{military}} doctrine developed by the Indian Armed Forces {{for use in a}} possible war with Pakistan. It involves the various branches of India's military conducting offensive operations as part of unified battle groups. The <b>Cold</b> <b>Start</b> doctrine is intended to allow India's conventional forces to perform holding attacks in order to prevent a nuclear retaliation from Pakistan in case of a conflict.|$|E
25|$|After the deescalation and the {{substantial}} diplomatic mediation, the Indian government, however, learned {{the seriousness of}} the military suspension by Pakistan in the region. Adjustments and development on offensive doctrine, <b>Cold</b> <b>Start,</b> was carried out by India as an aftermath of the war.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of this doctrine represents {{a significant change in}} Indian defence planning. Exercises aimed at reducing mobilisation time and improved network-centric warfare capabilities have contributed to the {{development of}} the <b>Cold</b> <b>Start</b> doctrine. Despite the advances, this doctrine remains in the experimental stage.|$|E
25|$|As per <b>Cold</b> <b>Start</b> promulgation, {{offensive}} operations {{could begin}} within 48 hours after orders have been issued. Such a limited response time would enable Indian forces to surprise their Pakistani counterparts. Operations would involve armoured spearheads launched from forward positions in Punjab and Rajasthan.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Cold</b> <b>Start</b> {{doctrine}} {{has invited}} criticism from Pakistani media and former generals {{who claim that}} although the doctrine was designed to punish Pakistan in a limited manner without triggering nuclear retaliation, the Indian Army cannot be sure if Pakistan's leadership will, in fact, refrain from such a response.|$|E
40|$|Effects of fuel {{atomization}} on <b>cold</b> <b>starting</b> of a 4 stroke cycle {{spark ignition engine}} were investigated experimentally. Two kinds of ultrasonic fuel injectors using a micro nozzle array (MNA injectors) were applied, whose nozzle diameter d= 4 and 6 μm, respectively. A conventional port fuel injector (PFI injector) was also used for comparison. The Sauter mean diameters (SMDs) of the sprays were 15 μm (MNA, d=μm), 23 μm (MNA, d= 6 μm), and 59 μm (PFI), respectively. An air cooled, single cylinder, 4 stroke cycle, spark ignition engine was used. The first ignition cycles and the cumulative fuel amount were investigated at {{a wide range of}} the air fuel ratio. For the MNA injector (d= 4 μm), the first ignition cycle became much earlier when compared with the PFI injector. The cumulative fuel amount during <b>cold</b> <b>starting</b> reduced by about 30 %. It is shown that, by use of the MNA injector, the unburned hydrocarbon emissions during <b>cold</b> <b>starting</b> could be reduced...|$|R

500|$|Flexible-fuel {{technology}} started {{being developed}} by Brazilian engineers {{near the end of}} the 1990s. The Brazilian flexible fuel car is built with an ethanol-ready engine and one fuel tank for both fuels. The small gasoline reservoir for starting the engine with pure ethanol in cold weather, used in earlier neat ethanol vehicles, was kept to avoid start up problems in the central and southern regions, where winter temperatures normally drop below [...] An improved flex motor generation was launched in 2009 and allowed to eliminate the need for this secondary gas reservoir tank. Another improvement was the reduction of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008.

40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>starting</b> {{of diesel}} engines is {{characterized}} by inherent problems such as long cranking periods and combustion instability leading {{to an increase in}} fuel consumption and the emission of high concentrations of hydrocarbons which appear as white smoke. Accordingly, a signal indicative of combustion during <b>cold</b> <b>starting</b> and idling operation is important for combustion and emission control. The ion current signal has been considered for the feedback control of both gasoline and diesel engines. However, the ion current signal produced from the combustion of the heterogeneous charge in diesel engines is weaker compared to that produced from the combustion of the homogeneous charge in gasoline engines because of the lower combustion temperatures reached in diesel engines. Consequently, this presents a problem in the detection of the ion current signal in diesel engines, particularly during starting and idling operations. This research investigates and addresses the ion current detection problems pertaining to <b>cold</b> <b>starting</b> and idling at various speeds. Also, different approaches have been endeavored to improve the signal detection under these conditions so as to aid its application for misfire detectio...|$|R

500|$|Because the CG 150 Titan Mix {{does not}} have a {{secondary}} gas tank for a <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> like the Brazilian flex cars do, the tank must have at least 20% of gasoline to avoid start up problems at temperatures below [...] The motorcycle’s panel includes a gauge to warn the driver about the actual ethanol-gasoline mix in the storage tank. In September 2009, Honda launched a second flexible-fuel motorcycle, the on-off road NXR 150 Bros Mix. During the first eight months after its market launch the CG 150 Titan Mix sold 139,059 motorcycles, capturing a 10.6% market share, and ranking second in sales of new motorcycles in the Brazilian market by October 2009, and by year's end, both Honda flexible-fuel motorcycles sold a total of 183,375 units, representing an 11.4% market share of the Brazilian new motorcycle sales in that year.

50|$|Since {{the turn}} of the 20th century, {{internal}} combustion engines have been the power source of choice. Between 1900 and 1960, gasoline was the predominant fuel, with kerosene (the Rumely Oil Pull was the most notable of this kind) and ethanol being common alternatives. Generally, one engine could burn any of those, although <b>cold</b> <b>starting</b> was easiest on gasoline. Often, a small auxiliary fuel tank was available to hold gasoline for <b>cold</b> <b>starting</b> and warm-up, while the main fuel tank held whatever fuel was most convenient or least expensive for the particular farmer. In the United Kingdom, a gasoline-kerosene engine is known as a petrol-paraffin engine.|$|R
25|$|During the 1960 model year, {{there were}} {{revisions}} to improve lubrication {{of the two}} rear connecting rods, voltage regulator function, <b>cold</b> <b>starting</b> and idling, acceleration, and to prevent breakage of {{the front and rear}} manifold mounting studs.|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{completed}} {{a study in}} which they investigated {{the use of a}} rich combustor to aid in <b>cold</b> <b>starting</b> spark-ignition engines fueled with either neat ethanol or neat methanol. The rich combustor burns the alcohol fuel outside the engine under fuel-rich conditions to produce a combustible product stream that is fed to the engine for <b>cold</b> <b>starting.</b> The rich combustor approach significantly extends the <b>cold</b> <b>starting</b> capability of alcohol-fueled engines. A design tool was developed that simulates the operation of the combustor and couples it to an engine/vehicle model. This tool allows the user to determine the fuel requirements of the rich combustor as the vehicle executes a given driving mission. The design tool was used to design and fabricate a rich combustor for use on a 2. 8 L automotive engine. The system was tested using a unique cold room that allows the engine to be coupled to an electric dynamometer. The engine was fitted with an aftermarket engine control system that permitted the fuel flow to the rich combustor to be programmed as a function of engine speed and intake manifold pressure. Testing indicated that reliable <b>cold</b> <b>starts</b> were achieved on both neat methanol and neat ethanol at temperatures as low as {minus} 20 C. Although starts were experienced at temperatures as low as {minus} 30 C, these were erratic. They believe that an important factor at the very low temperatures is the balance between the high mechanical friction of the engine and the low energy density of the combustible mixture fed to the engine from the rich combustor...|$|R
2500|$|The Chairman {{joint chiefs}} of Pakistan {{military}} declared 2010 the [...] "Year of Training", conducting a large scale joint-military exercise named Azm-e-Nau–III which focused on offensive defence against <b>Cold</b> <b>Start.</b> The military also tested the Nasr, a nuclear-capable missile from the family of Hatf-IX missiles with a purported range of 60km, high accuracy and a shoot-and-scoot delivery system. The Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses stated {{that the development of}} the Nasr indicates that Pakistan views <b>Cold</b> <b>Start</b> with concern and that the missile was meant to deter India's implementation of the doctrine.

2500|$|Walter Ladwig has {{suggested}} that a host of factors, including terrain, the favorable deployment of Pakistani forces, {{and a lack of}} strategic surprise in the most likely conflict scenarios, will mitigate whatever mobilization advantages India may be gaining through its experimentation with <b>Cold</b> <b>Start.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Former Indian defence {{minister}} Jaswant Singh has denied {{the existence of}} the doctrine, stating, [...] "There is no <b>Cold</b> <b>Start</b> doctrine. No such thing.

50|$|The {{problem of}} <b>cold</b> <b>starting</b> {{has been greatly}} reduced since the {{introduction}} of engine starters, which are now commonplace on all modern vehicles. The higher revs {{that can be achieved}} using electric starter motors improves the chance of successful ignition.|$|R
50|$|While {{gasoline}} {{internal combustion}} engines are {{much easier to}} <b>start</b> in <b>cold</b> weather than diesel engines, they can still have <b>cold</b> weather <b>starting</b> problems under extreme conditions. For years the solution was to park the car in heated areas. In {{some parts of the}} world the oil was actually drained and heated over night and returned to the engine for <b>cold</b> <b>starts.</b> In the early 1950s the gasoline Gasifier unit was developed, where, on <b>cold</b> weather <b>starts,</b> raw gasoline was diverted to the unit where part of the fuel was burned causing the other part to become a hot vapor sent directly to the intake valve manifold. This unit was quite popular until electric engine block heaters became standard on gasoline engines sold in cold climates.|$|R
50|$|Benefits of fuel {{injection}} include smoother and more consistent transient throttle response, such as during quick throttle transitions, easier <b>cold</b> <b>starting,</b> more accurate adjustment {{to account for}} extremes of ambient temperatures and changes in air pressure, more stable idling, decreased maintenance needs, and better fuel efficiency.|$|R
2500|$|Brazilian {{flex fuel}} {{vehicles}} can operate with ethanol mixtures up to E100, which is hydrous ethanol (with up to 4% water), which causes vapor pressure to drop faster {{as compared to}} E85 vehicles. As a result, Brazilian flex vehicles are built with a small secondary gasoline reservoir located near the engine. During a <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> pure gasoline is injected to avoid starting problems at low temperatures. This provision is particularly necessary for users of Brazil's southern and central regions, where temperatures normally drop below [...] during the winter. An improved flex engine generation was launched in 2009 that {{eliminates the need for}} the secondary gas storage tank. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first Brazilian flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for <b>cold</b> <b>start.</b>|$|E
2500|$|India denies {{having a}} <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> {{strategy}}. Quoting the Indian Army chief: [...] "There is nothing called 'Cold Start'.

In the recent years, we have been improving our systems with respect to mobilization, but our basic military posture is defensive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Each {{unit was}} {{designed}} to [...] "hot" [...] start within 20 or 30 minutes. A <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> can take between three and four hours. It is a delicate operation, since moving parts must be relatively uniformly warmed to prevent damage. The success of this operation involves more than 70 steps and is controlled by a sequence monitoring system to avoid missteps. Cooling off a unit after use required precautions to prevent buckling of the main shaft.|$|E
50|$|Costs can {{be reduced}} in {{production}} engines by casting the inlet and exhaust manifolds as one unit. This also transfers further heat to the inlet {{eliminating the need for}} manifold heating and other related devices. Such an engine is overall simpler and also has improved <b>cold</b> <b>starting.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} {{available}} {{to run on}} Ethanol, which usually generates at least 10% more power than a corresponding petrol model, with a circa 25% increase to fuel consumption. It had no problems at all for <b>cold</b> <b>starts</b> and high fuel consumption unlike other early ethanol-powered engines.|$|R
50|$|Diesel engines {{make use}} of glow plugs to heat the {{combustion}} chamber prior to ignition, improving the conditions inside the engine, while certain manufacturers (such as Mazda with the RX-7 model) have incorporated a block heater, which heats the engine block prior to ignition to reduce the problem of <b>cold</b> <b>starting.</b>|$|R
