5|$|Some {{users of}} the drug {{consider}} it an entheogen and a tool to supplement practices for transcendence, including meditation and psychonautics. The intensity and duration {{of the effects of}} psilocybin are variable, depending on species or cultivar of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and set and setting, as was shown in experiments led by Timothy Leary at Harvard University in the early 1960s. Once ingested, psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin, which then acts on serotonin receptors in the brain. The mind-altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two to six hours, although to individuals under the influence of psilocybin, the effects may seem to last much longer, since the drug can distort the perception of time. Psilocybin has a low toxicity and a relatively low harm potential, and reports of lethal doses of the drug are rare. Several modern bioanalytical methods have been adapted to rapidly and accurately screen the levels of psilocybin in mushroom samples and body fluids. Since the 1990s, there has been a renewal of scientific research into the potential medical and psychological therapeutic benefits of psilocybin for treating conditions including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety, treatment-resistant depression, <b>cluster</b> <b>headaches,</b> and anxiety related to terminal cancer. Possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries, and it has been classified as a scheduled drug by many national drug laws.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the mode of}} inheritance of <b>cluster</b> <b>headache</b> in 370 families.

40|$|<b>Cluster</b> <b>headache</b> is {{the most}} severe of the primary headaches.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{study the}} {{clinical}} characteristics of <b>cluster</b> <b>headache</b> in women. <b>Cluster</b> <b>headache</b> is a disorder of men (male to female ratio 6 - 7 : 1).  METHODS—Retrospective chart review to identify all women diagnosed with <b>cluster</b> <b>headache</b> at an academic headache centre from January 1995 through July 1998.  RESULTS—Thirty {{two women and}} 69 men were identified. The mean age of onset of <b>cluster</b> <b>headache</b> was 29. 4 years in women versus 31. 3 years in men. Two peaks of onset in women (2 nd and 5 th decade) were identified compared with one in men (3 rd decade). Episodic <b>cluster</b> <b>headache</b> was present in 75 % of women and 77 % of men. Women and men had on average 3 attacks a day, but attack duration was shorter in women (67. 2 minutes v 88. 2 minutes). <b>Cluster</b> <b>headache</b> period duration (11. 1 weeks v 10 weeks) and remission periods (21. 1 months v 23. 1 months) were similar in women and men. Miosis and ptosis seemed to be less common in women (miosis 13. 3 % v 24. 6 %, ptosis 41. 9 % v 58. 1 %) whereas lacrimation and nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea were almost equally prevalent in women and men. Women had more nausea than men (62. 5 % v 43. 5 %, p= 0. 09) and significantly more vomiting (46. 9 % v 17. 4 %, p= 0. 003). Photophobia occurred in 75 % of women and 81. 2 % of men, and phonophobia occurred in 50 % of women and 47. 8 % of men.  CONCLUSIONS—The clinical characteristics of <b>cluster</b> <b>headache</b> in women {{are very similar to}} those in men. Women develop the disorder at an earlier age of onset and experience more "migrainous symptoms" with <b>cluster</b> <b>headache,</b> especially vomiting. Both men and women have frequent photophobia and phonophobia with <b>cluster</b> <b>headache</b> attacks.
