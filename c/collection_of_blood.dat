25|$|A false aneurysm, or pseudoaneurysm, is a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> leaking {{completely}} out of an artery or vein, but confined next to the vessel by the surrounding tissue.

25|$|Some {{complications}} of arachnoid cysts can occur when a cyst is damaged because of minor head trauma. Trauma {{can cause the}} fluid within a cyst to leak into other areas (e.g., subarachnoid space). Blood vessels {{on the surface of}} a cyst may tear and bleed into the cyst (intracystic hemorrhage), increasing its size. If a blood vessel bleeds on the outside of a cyst, a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> (hematoma) may result. In the cases of intracystic hemorrhage and hematoma, the individual may have symptoms of increased pressure within the cranium and signs of compression of nearby nerve (neural) tissue.|$|E

500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} and laceration are {{injuries to}} the lung tissue. Pulmonary laceration, in which lung tissue is torn or cut, differs from pulmonary contusion {{in that the}} former involves disruption of the macroscopic architecture of the lung, while the latter does not. When lacerations fill with blood, the result is pulmonary hematoma, a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> within the lung tissue. Contusion involves hemorrhage in the alveoli (tiny air-filled sacs responsible for absorbing oxygen), but a hematoma is a discrete clot of blood not interspersed with lung tissue. [...] A collapsed lung can result when the pleural cavity (the space outside the lung) accumulates blood (hemothorax) or air (pneumothorax) or both (hemopneumothorax). These conditions do not inherently involve damage to the lung tissue itself, {{but they may be}} associated with it. [...] Injuries to the chest wall are also distinct from but may be associated with lung injuries. Chest wall injuries include rib fractures and flail chest, in which multiple ribs are broken so that a segment of the ribcage is detached {{from the rest of the}} chest wall and moves independently.|$|E

2500|$|Newborn {{screening}} debuted as {{a public}} health program in the United States in the early 1960s, and has expanded to countries around the world, with different testing menus in each country. Both prenatal screening (screening before birth) and newborn screening (screening soon after birth) have improved health care. The first disorder detected by modern newborn screening programs was phenylketonuria, a metabolic condition in which the inability to degrade the essential amino acid phenylalanine can cause irreversible mental retardation unless detected early. [...] With early detection and dietary management, the negative effects of the disease can be largely eliminated. [...] Robert Guthrie developed a simple method using a bacterial inhibition assay that could detect high levels of phenylalanine in blood shortly after a baby was born. [...] Guthrie also pioneered the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> on filter paper which could be easily transported, recognizing the need for a simple system if the screening was going to be done on a large scale. [...] Newborn screening around the world is still done using similar filter paper.|$|E

5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are <b>collections</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> in {{or around}} the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with {{bleeding}} in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|R

2500|$|Initially, the Chinese {{government}} focused its preventive strategies on stopping HIV {{from entering}} the country. AIDS {{was seen as a}} consequence of contact with the West, and [...] "AIDS" [...] ( [...] , Àizībìng) was frequently punned with its Chinese heterograph, [...] "loving capitalism disease" [...] ( [...] , Àizībìng). Regulations were introduced that required foreigners who intended to stay 1 year or more and Chinese residents returning from overseas to have an HIV test. All imported blood products were banned. There were attempts to stop transmission within the country as well – e.g., laws against drug use and prostitution were strengthened and authorities were allowed to isolate HIV-positive individuals. The hazards related to uncontrolled illegal <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> and plasma were realised in 1994 after an outbreak in blood donors, and countermeasures were initiated. In {{much the same way as}} in other countries, traditional public health methods of containment and isolation of infectious disease cases proved ineffective. Containment policies occurred in the context of rapid social and economic change, in which there were increases in drug use and changing sexual mixing patterns. These early policies did little to stop transmission of HIV; in fact, they probably promoted concealment of risk activities and made identification of HIV reservoirs more difficult.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to verify the efficacy of minor modification in procedure for <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> diagnostic <b>blood</b> specimens by venipuncture from CLSI H 03 -A 6 document is able to reduce the tourniquet application time. Materials and methods: Thirty phlebotomists were invited to participate. Each phlebotomist was trained individually to perform the new venipuncture procedure that shortens the time of tourniquet release and removal. The phlebotomy training program was delivered over 8 h. After training, all phlebotomists were monitored for 20 working days, to guarantee the adoption of the correct new procedures for <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> diagnostic <b>blood</b> specimens. After this time frame the phlebotomists were evaluated to verify whether the new procedure for blood collection derived from CLSI H 03 -A 6 document was effective to improve the quality process by decrease in tourniquet application time. We compared the tourniquet application time and qualitative difference of phlebotomy procedures between laboratories before and after phlebotomy training. Results: The overall mean ± SD tourniquet application time before and after this intervention were 118 ± 1 s and 30 ± 1 s respectively. Minor modifications in procedure for blood collection were able to reduce significantly the tourniquet application time (- 88 s, P < 0. 001). Conclusions: The minor modifications in procedure for <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> diagnostic <b>blood</b> specimens by venipuncture from CLSI H 03 -A 6 document were able to reduce the tourniquet application time. Now the proposed new procedure for <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> diagnostic <b>blood</b> specimens by venipuncture could be considered usefulness and should be put into practice by all quality laboratory managers and/or phlebotomy coordinators to avoid preanalytical errors regard venous stasis and guarantee patient safety...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the course of postprandial triglycerides, as well as postprandial blood glucose, total cholesterol, total protein and hematocrit, after acute exercise in physically fit adults. Ten physically fit university students of both genders, with a mean age of 23. 2 ± 1. 9 years, were submitted to the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> postprandial <b>blood</b> samples in two situations: control and exercise.
