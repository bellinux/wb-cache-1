The innermost vestment, the zona pellucida, is a glycoprotein shell, which captures and tethers the sperm before they penetrate it.

We have compared these sperm-generated forces with the <b>calculated</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of sperm-zona bonds, and found that a motile sperm can be tethered, at least temporarily, by a single bond. Therefore, sperm can be captured by the first bond formed and tethered permanently by a few. The sperm cannot subsequently penetrate the zona unless the bonds are first eliminated.

This paper introduces a structure-dependent fit, which gives a prediction of two major mechanical properties (elastic modulus and <b>tensile</b> <b>strength)</b> of compacts consisting of two particulate components. The structure-dependent fit {{takes into account the}} properties of the individual materials, macroscopic changes in the compact structure, and, if necessary, an interfacial interaction between particles of both components. Firstly, the relationship between the solid volume fraction and mechanical properties of compacts of single materials was fitted by the percolation theory. From these fits, the mechanical properties at zero porosity and the volume fraction of particles coupled in parallel were obtained. The material characteristics were applied into the structure-dependent fit to predict the maximal values (the upper boundary) and minimal values (the lower boundary) of the mechanical property of compacts made from the blends. It has been shown that the elastic modulus of the blends can be predicted by the upper boundary of the structure-dependent fit. The <b>calculated</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> result into a relative estimation of the adhesive interfacial interaction between particles of both components.

It is observed that a small number of accurate measurements of flat tablets are sufficient for obtaining a representative calibration when the equation is forced to reduce to the Hertz solution. We made a rigorous comparison between all the proposed models by applying three equivalent optimization problems and calculating the corresponding two norms.

Firstly, the thesis focussed on the characterisation of cohesive powder behaviour during aerosolization at a sequence of air flow rates to understand the de-agglomeration behaviour. The raw materials were processed with a well characterised laboratory mechanofusion technique prior to aerosolization. The realtime particle size distributions of the aerosolized plume were obtained using Spraytec® laser diffraction from a Rotahaler® device at various air flow rates (45 - 120 L/min). The significance (p< 0. 05) was obtained from ANOVA and t-test using SPSS software. The relative de-agglomeration of the magnesium stearate coated salbutamol sulphate was much higher than the uncoated salbutamol sulphate at all air flow rates. Among the three magnesium stearate coated salbutamol sulphate powders, the salbutamol sulphate coated with 2 % (w/w; (2 % powder)) magnesium stearate showed the best de-agglomeration properties, followed by the salbutamol sulphate coated with 5 %(w/w; (5 % powder)) magnesium stearate. The salbutamol sulphate coated with 1 % (w/w; (1 % powder)) magnesium stearate was not de-agglomerated as well as the 2 % (w/w) and 5 % (w/w) powders, but still was significantly improved compared to the uncoated salbutamol sulphate. The relative de-agglomeration versus air flow rate profiles were then subsequently modelled applying a three parameters sigmoidal equation. The estimated parameters provided an approach to represent and characterise the relative de-agglomeration behaviour of each cohesive powder and defined powder micro-structures of cohesive powders. Secondly, the study was extended to investigate the difference in the de-agglomeration rate between the uncoated and coated salbutamol sulphate powders. The rate constants of de-agglomeration were calculated from the data collected from the Spraytec® laser diffraction particle sizing of the aerosol plume. The emitted fine particle mass vs. time profiles were modelled using a mono-exponential equation to estimate the rate constant of powder de-agglomeration (kd). At high air flow rates, the coated salbutamol sulphate powders generally presented with higher kd values; flow rate did not affect the rate of de-agglomeration of the uncoated salbutamol sulphate. There was no obvious evidence indicating that mechanofusion increased rates of de-agglomeration and there was no relationship between the amount of coating used in the mechanofusion process and kd value. Mechanofusion therefore appeared only to increase the extent of de-agglomeration. Large variability associated with Rotahaler® was expected due to variable capsule orientation and chaotic motion of the capsule in the unrestricting volume of the capsule chamber. Thirdly, the thesis correlated the de-agglomeration behaviour to <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> of the cohesive salbutamol sulphate powders. According to the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> equation (Kendall and Stainton, 2001 a) [equation not displayed] where ø is the packing fraction, W is the work of adhesion and dp is the diameter of the particle. The de-agglomeration of the salbutamol sulphate powders was related to the determining parameters of the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> (particle size, packing fraction and work of cohesion). When using the individual distributions of these parameters, only the work of cohesion was consistent with increased de-agglomeration. The work of cohesion profiles indicated that the coated salbutamol sulphate powders had lower energy distributions hence lower <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> than the uncoated powders. The packing fraction of the coated salbutamol sulphates were larger than the uncoated salbutamol sulphate, the low packing fraction of the uncoated powder led to a paradoxical low <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> The packing sizes were slightly reduced by mechanofusion process which was consistent with an increased <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and reduced de-agglomeration. This complex interplay meant that the overall increased de-agglomeration observed in the relative de-agglomeration profile could not be fully explained by the Kendall and Stainton Equation. The <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> can not be estimated due to the uncertainty in extrapolation of the work of cohesion. Monte Carlo simulation, necessary to determine the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> required the work of cohesion data to be extrapolated to 100 % surface coverage; however the results generated from IGC only covered less than 7 % of the surface for these salbutamol sulphate powders. The remaining 93 % surface coverage data were extrapolated using equations of best fit line, but it was recognised that this approximation caused large uncertainties and errors. Therefore the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> distributions would contain these major uncertainties and were not determined. The outcomes of this thesis provided an approach to characterise the cohesive powders, enabling a better understanding of micro-structures of the cohesive powders for inhalation and possibly provide a new methodology to screen drug powders in the future developing process. The work also provided a unique mechanistic insight into the contrasting aerosolization behaviours of the micronized drug, before and after surface modification...|$|R

In this paper, the mechanical properties of grafold, an architecture of folded graphene nanoribbon, are investigated via molecular dynamics simulations and intriguing features are discovered. In contrast to graphene, grafold is found to develop large deformations upon both tensile and compressive loading along the longitudinal direction. The tensile deformation is plastic, whereas the compressive deformation is elastic and reversible within the strain range investigated. The <b>calculated</b> Young's modulus, <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> and fracture strain are {{comparable to those of}} graphene, while the compressive strength and strain are much higher than those of graphene. The length, width, and folding number of grafold have distinctive impacts on the mechanical performance. These unique behaviors render grafold a promising material for advanced mechanical applications...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{influence}} of bubble foams on magma permeability and strength is critical to investigations of volcanic eruption mechanisms. Increasing foam porosity decreases strength, enhancing the probability of an eruption. However, higher porosities lead to larger permeabilities, which can lessen the eruption hazard. Here we measure bubble size and wall thickness distributions, as well as connectivity, and <b>calculate</b> permeabilities and <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> of basaltic foams imaged by synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy during bubble growth in hydrated basaltic melts. Rapid vesiculation produces porous foams whose fragmentation thresholds are only 5 - 6 MPa and whose permeabilities increase from approximately 1 × 10 - 10 to 1 × 10 - 9 m 2 between 10 and 14 s despite decreasing connectivity between bubbles. These results indicate that basaltic magmas are most susceptible to failure immediately upon vesiculation and at later times, perhaps only 10 's of seconds later, permeability increases may lessen the hazard of explosive, basaltic, Plinian eruptions...|$|R
40|$|The {{isothermal}} crystallization {{and mechanical}} behavior of polycaprolactone (PCL) with zinc oxide (ZnO) with oleic acid and glycerol monooleate (GMO) were studied. Theoretical melting points calculated by the Flory-Huggins and Thompson-Gibbs models were thoroughly compared with {{differential scanning calorimetry}} experimental observations. The isothermal crystallization kinetic parameters by Avrami analysis showed that crystallization was controlled by nucleation, crystal growth was spherical, and the nucleation type changed between thermal and athermal nucleation. X-ray diffraction showed that when the additives were used together both the crystal thickness {{and the degree of}} crystallinity increased. A multiple-response regression analysis was made with the ZnO, oleic acid, and GMO concentrations as variables and the crystallinity as output. Interaction parameters by the Pukanzky model were <b>calculated</b> from the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> at the yield point and indicated that the addition of oleic acid or GMO improved the interface between the ZnO particles and PCL.
