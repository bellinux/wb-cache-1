5|$|Chinese Ming style {{clothing}} was forced on Vietnamese {{people by the}} Nguyễn dynasty. The tunics and trouser clothing of the Han Chinese on the Ming and Qing tradition was worn by the Vietnamese. However, Han-Chinese clothing is assembled by several pieces of clothing including both pants and skirts called Qun (裙) or chang (裳) which {{is a part of}} Hanfu garments throughout the history of Han Chinese clothing. The Ao Dai was created when tucks which were <b>close</b> <b>fitting</b> and compact were added in the 1920s to this Chinese style. The Chinese clothing in the form of trousers and tunic were mandated by the Vietnamese Nguyen government. It was up to the 1920s in Vietnam's north area in isolated hamlets where skirts were worn. The Chinese Ming dynasty, Tang dynasty, and Han dynasty {{clothing was}} referred to be adopted by Vietnamese military and bureaucrats by the Nguyen Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát (Nguyen The Tong). Chinese clothing started influencing Vietnamese dress in the Ly dynasty. The current Ao Dai was introduced by the Nguyen Lords.|$|E

50|$|The tam, or tam cap, {{became a}} fashionable women's {{accessory}} {{from the early}} 1920s and {{was derived from the}} tam o' shanter. It followed the trends for <b>closer</b> <b>fitting</b> hats and for borrowing from men's fashion.|$|R
5000|$|In public {{swimming}} pools in France {{for reasons of}} hygiene, it is only permitted to wear <b>closer</b> <b>fitting</b> styles of swimwear. Men, for instance, must wear [...] "Speedo" [...] style bathing suits and not baggy shorts or trunks.|$|R
25|$|German women adopted hats like fashionable men's baretts {{early in}} the century; these were worn over caps or cauls (colettes) made of netted cord over a silk lining. Hats became fashionable in England as an {{alternative}} to the hood toward the 1540s. <b>Close</b> <b>fitting</b> caps of fur were worn in cold climates.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack consists of strips of either metal or plastic that mold to one's back {{to provide a}} good fit, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. Usually a complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The <b>close</b> <b>fitting</b> of the back section to the wearer's back allows the pack to be closely attached to the body, and gives a predictable movement of the load. The {{internal frame}} backpack was invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, the founder of Lowepro.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rising}} {{popularity}} of the longer coat and waistcoat, the large collected rhinegraves and overskirt were abandoned {{in favor of more}} <b>close</b> <b>fitting</b> breeches. By the late 1670s, close fitted breeches were worn with the stockings worn over them and on or above the knee, often being gartered with a garter below the knee. With the long waistcoat and stockings worn over the knee, very little of the breeches could be seen. A possible reason that the stockings were worn over the knee, was to give the impression of longer legs since the waist coat fell very low, just above the knee. The breeches tended to be of the same material as the coat. The stockings varied in color.|$|E

50|$|Highly elastic fabrics such as Lycra/Spandex {{have mostly}} {{replaced}} raw nylon backing, since the nylon by itself cannot be stretched {{and makes the}} neoprene very stiff. Incorporating Lycra into the backing permits {{a large amount of}} stretching that does not damage the suit, and allowed suits to become <b>closer</b> <b>fitting.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the descriptors, MeSH also contains some 139,000 supplementary concept records. These {{do not belong to}} the controlled vocabulary as such; instead they enlarge the thesaurus and contain links to the <b>closest</b> <b>fitting</b> descriptor to be used in a MEDLINE search. Many of these records describe chemical substances.|$|R
25|$|The head is well {{balanced}} {{in proportion to}} the size of the dog and is deeper than broad with the length of muzzle and the length of skull approximately equal. With <b>close</b> <b>fitting</b> eyelids, the eyes are set into the skull upon a slight oblique; the eyes are medium-sized, almond shaped, and colored dark brown. The ears are fleshy, moderately sized, and pendant shaped, with sufficient substance to hang close to the skull and drop the tip of the ears level with the inside corners of the mouth. The Leonberger's ears rise from halfway between the eye and the top of his skull to level with the top of his skull. Though level bites and slight anomalies not affecting the robustness of the lower jaw are common, the ideal Leonberger capably possesses a strong scissor bite with full dentition.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} Tube design, trains passing through <b>close</b> <b>fitting</b> tunnels act as pistons to create air pressure gradients between stations. This pressure difference drives ventilation between platforms {{and the surface}} exits through the passenger foot network. This system depends on adequate cross sectional area of the airspace above the passengers’ heads in the foot tunnels and escalators, where laminar airflow {{is proportional to the}} fourth power of the radius, the Hagen–Poiseuille equation. It also depends on an absence of turbulence in the tunnel headspace. In many stations the ventilation system is now ineffective because of alterations that reduce tunnel diameters and increase turbulence. An example is Green Park tube station, where false ceiling panels attached to metal frames have been installed that reduce the above-head airspace diameter by more than half in many parts. This has the effect of reducing laminar airflow by some 94%.|$|E
25|$|Chinese style {{clothing}} was forced on Vietnamese {{people by the}} Nguyễn. Trousers have been adopted by White H'mong. The trousers replaced the traditional skirts of the females of the White Hmong. The tunics and trouser clothing of the Han Chinese on the Ming tradition was worn by the Vietnamese. The Ao Dai was created when tucks which were <b>close</b> <b>fitting</b> and compact were added in the 1920s to this Chinese style. Trousers and tunics on the Chinese pattern in 1774 were ordered by the Vo Vuong Emperor to replace the sarong type Vietnamese clothing. The Chinese clothing {{in the form of}} trousers and tunic were mandated by the Vietnamese Nguyen government. It was up to the 1920s in Vietnam's north area in isolated hamlets where skirts were worn. The Chinese Ming dynasty, Tang dynasty, and Han dynasty {{clothing was}} ordered to be adopted by Vietnamese military and bureaucrats by the Nguyen Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát (Nguyen The Tong).|$|E
50|$|Early Joseon {{continued}} the women's fashion for baggy, loose clothing, {{such as those}} seen on the mural from the tomb of Bak Ik (1332-1398). However, by the 16th century, the jeogori had shortened to the waist and appears to have become <b>closer</b> <b>fitting,</b> although not to the extremes of the bell-shaped silhouette of the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} issues in {{hearing-aid}} fittings is the abnormal perception of the user’s own voice as too loud, “boomy,” or “hollow. ” This phenomenon known as the occlusion effect be reduced by large vents in the earmolds or by open-fit hearing aids. This review {{provides an overview of}} publications related to open and <b>closed</b> hearing-aid <b>fittings.</b> First, the occlusion effect and its consequences for perception while using hearing aids are described. Then, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} open compared with <b>closed</b> <b>fittings</b> and their impact on the fitting process are addressed. The advantages include less occlusion, improved own-voice perception and sound quality, and increased localization performance. The disadvantages associated with open-fit hearing aids include reduced benefits of directional microphones and noise reduction, as well as less compression and less available gain before feedback. The final part of this review addresses the need for new approaches to combine the advantages of open and <b>closed</b> hearing-aid <b>fittings...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{name was}} popularized by the 1956 movie Baby Doll, {{starring}} Carroll Baker {{in the title}} role as a 19-year-old nymphet. This {{marked the beginning of the}} enduring popularity of the style for adults. Baby Doll pajamas in the 1950s through the 1960s consisted of a top and a loose fitting short bloomer bottom with elasticized waist and legs. In the 1970s through the 1990s, the bloomer bottom was replaced by <b>closer</b> <b>fitting</b> briefs with elastic waist and legs. The most recent versions of baby doll pajamas have eliminated the elastic on the legs, the bottoms being either shorts or tap pants.|$|R
25|$|Bascinets, {{other than}} great bascinets, could be worn beneath a great helm. However, only those without face protection, {{or those with}} the <b>close</b> <b>fitting</b> bretache, could be worn in this manner. The great helm afforded {{a high degree of}} protection, but at the cost of very {{restricted}} vision and agility. The lighter types of bascinet gave less protection but allowed greater freedom of movement and better vision. The practicality of a man-at-arms being able to take off a great helm during a battle, if he wanted to continue fighting wearing just a bascinet, is unclear. By the mid 14th century the great helm was probably largely relegated to tournament use. However, Henry V of England is reputed to have worn a great helm over a bascinet at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. He was recorded as receiving a blow to the head during the battle, which damaged his helmet; the double protection afforded by wearing two helmets may have saved his life.|$|E

5000|$|Along {{with other}} {{headgear}} formerly reserved for men - including the top hat and bowler - it was popular by the 1920s, suiting the fashion for shorter hairstyles. A 1920 article in The Guardian described {{the prevalence of}} <b>closer</b> <b>fitting</b> designs based on the tam' o shanter in combination with more ornate blouses and neater hairstyles, noting: [...] "Since the majority of blouses follow Greek or quasi-Greek lines, it is natural for the hat worn with them to follow also the Greek type of headgear". The article noted that its versatility was another reason for current popularity: [...] "it can be twisted and folded into the close-fitting shapes that are so remarkably becoming...it lends itself admirably to...all kinds of embroidery or needlework stitched apparently at random over it".|$|R
50|$|The {{world of}} {{clothing}} is always changing, as new cultural influences meet technological innovations. Researchers in scientific labs have been developing prototypes for fabrics {{that can serve}} functional purposes well beyond their traditional roles, for example, clothes that can automatically adjust their temperature, repel bullets, project images, and generate electricity. Some practical advances already available to consumers are bullet-resistant garments made with kevlar and stain-resistant fabrics that are coated with chemical mixtures that reduce the absorption of liquids. New blends of Spandex cotton blends allow for form fitting and stretching of <b>closer</b> <b>fitting</b> mass produced patterns. New mesh materials allow for better breathe-ability in shoes. New insulation fibers and batting make lighter rainments that keep you warm when wet and recent advances in coatings for fabrics or down also repel water.|$|R
50|$|There {{were quite}} a number of similar styles and types of Japanese armor; the dō-maru is {{particularly}} defined by the fact that a dō-maru opens on the right side as opposed to the haramaki style which opened in the back and the ō-yoroi the cuirass of which is completely open on the right side requiring a separate plate (waidate) to cover the right side. The ō-yoroi was a heavy box like armour meant for use on horse back, it was also expensive to make. The dō-maru like the haramaki had more skirt plates (kusazuri) than an ō-yoroi and was lighter, <b>closer</b> <b>fitting</b> and less expensive to make. The dō-maru was easier to fight with on foot and eventually even higher status samurai adopted the dō-maru over the ō-yoroi.|$|R

2500|$|In 1953, Hollywood film The French Line {{was found}} {{objectionable}} under the Hays Code because of Jane Russell's [...] "breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure" [...] {{while some of}} her décollete gowns were thought [...] "...intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage." [...] But other actresses defied the then standards. For example, Gina Lollobrigida raised eyebrows with her famous low-cut dress in 1960, and other celebrities, performers and models followed suit, and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles of various depths are now common in many situations. During the 1950s, Hollywood and the fashion industry successfully promoted large cloven bustlines (and falsies). In the late 1960s, erogenous attention began to shift from the large bust to the trim lower torso, reasserting the need to diet, especially as new clothing fashions — brief, sheer, and <b>close</b> <b>fitting</b> — prohibited heavy reliance on foundation lingerie. Legs were relatively less emphasized as elements of beauty.|$|E
40|$|Most Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs) {{based on}} the Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) {{generally}} assume perfect or imperfect debugging. However, environmental factors introduce great uncertainty for SRGMs {{in the development and}} testing phase. We propose a novel NHPP model based on partial differential equation (PDE), to quantify the uncertainties associated with perfect or imperfect debugging process. We represent the environmental uncertainties collectively as a noise of arbitrary correlation. Under the new stochastic framework, one could compute the full statistical information of the debugging process, for example, its probabilistic density function (PDF). Through a number of comparisons with historical data and existing methods, such as the classic NHPP model, the proposed model exhibits a <b>closer</b> <b>fitting</b> to observation. In addition to conventional focus on the mean value of fault detection, the newly derived full statistical information could further help software developers make decisions on system maintenance and risk assessment...|$|R
