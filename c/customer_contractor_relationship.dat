Correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationship.

40|$|The {{research}} programme {{was designed to}} investigate the relationship between uses of progression planning tools and main <b>contractor</b> subcontractor collaborative <b>relationships.</b> The research was carried out within two Norwegian construction companies where collaborative progression planning tools and methodologies based on the Last Planner system of production control was used. The scope of the research was to test whether such uses could positively affect the collaborative <b>relationships</b> between the <b>contractors</b> and project participants on the construction site. Collaborative relationships in this research referred to a working climate of joint efforts to bring construction projects forward. Literature claimed that adversarial relationships caused inferior productivity levels in the industry. <b>Contractor</b> <b>relationships</b> were assumed to influence how production processes were progressing. Thus developing collaborative relationships was assumed vital {{in order to improve}} productivity levels. The DBA research was based on case-studies (observation and interviews) and an quantitative survey in the two construction companies. Current research concluded that uses of progression planning tools may influence collaborative <b>contractor</b> <b>relationships</b> provided an equal attention is paid to structural and systematic approaches to collaborative planning, as to the social and relational dimensions, such as stimulating and motivating interaction and communication among project participants. The thesis provides detailed descriptions of the process elements. The study provides in depth insight into collaborative development processes in project based production settings. The results may be valuable for researchers who aim to further advance knowledge of the importance of participant relationships in the field of construction management. The results may also be of value to construction managers who wish to emphasise the collaborative aspects of conducting projects...|$|R

Subcontracts in construction are often implemented in the spirit of adversarial relations that have traditionally characterised procurement in the industry. The paper presents an overview of construction procurement and discusses several macro factors that are influencing business activity in construction, with attendant repercussions for contractor-subcontractor relationships and construction procurement in general. It proposes a co-contracting agenda as a means of engendering the same benefits that partnering has brought to the client-principal <b>contractor</b> <b>relationship.</b> The paper argues that a co-contracting agenda will be essential for achieving the levels of productivity that will be required in the intensifying competition that the industry will face in the future...|$|R

40|$|Extract][10. 05] Dispute {{resolution}} in the workplace covers a range of conflicts, processes and regulatory frameworks. Broadly speaking, {{there are two main}} categories of conflicts affecting organisations: internal conflicts, between employees and between employees and management; and external conflicts, between the organisation and/or its representatives and outsiders such as clients, <b>customers,</b> <b>contractors</b> or regulatory bodies. This chapter will focus on the first category, conflict within the workplace. Conflict is prevalent within workplaces, and recent research has demonstrated that managing conflict is a time-consuming and costly exercise for organisations and their managers. The types of conflicts that might arise within an organisation include: conflicts between employees (based on differences in personality, work styles, goals, etc); conflicts between an employee and a manager about performance issues; and conflicts between groups of employees (perhaps represented by a union) and management about working conditions and pay. Particular types of workplace conflict might include issues of bullying and harassment, discrimination, and unfair dismissal, as well as more minor conflicts between employees around day-to-day workplace activities and personality differences...|$|R

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfillment for {{the requirements}} for the Degree of Master of Commerce (MCOM) at Strathmore UniversityThis study investigated the influence of <b>contractor</b> <b>relationships</b> on total quality management practices in context of the Kenyan construction industry. The study was guided by five specific objectives: to establish total quality management practices among contractors in the Kenyan construction industry; to analyze influence of contractor-client relationship on total quality management practices among contractors in the Kenyan construction industry; to analyze influence of contractor-subcontractor relationship on total quality management practices among contractors in the Kenyan construction industry; to analyze influence of contractor-supplier relationship on total quality management practices among contractors in the Kenyan construction industry; to examine barriers to total quality management practices among contractors in the Kenyan construction industry. The study was premised on Juran’s, Deming’s and Six Sigma theories on total quality management. This study applied a cross-sectional research design. The target population for the study is 5, 777 contractors as registered by the National Construction Association (NCA) in Nairobi County. The sample size was established at 197 contractors. The study adopted stratified random sampling procedure. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data for the study. Data analysis techniques used were central tendency (mean, standard deviations, percentages), correlation and regression analysis using SPSS Version 22. The data was presented in tables and charts and researcher’s interpretation. The findings showed that contractor-client relationships had the most significant effect on TQM practices, customer focus and management was the most practiced TQM principle and procedural barriers are a hindrance to TQM practices {{in the construction industry}} in Nairobi County. The study concludes that <b>contractor</b> <b>relationships</b> {{have a positive effect on}} TQM practices in the Kenyan construction industry. The study recommends that customer focus and management should be the focus of contractors in practicing total quality management in their work. Through collaborating and cooperating with the client during the construction process means that contractors can be able to meet the client quality requirements thus achieving total quality management...|$|R

A methodology for identification and selection of 'best practice' firms was developed and acquisition procedures within Ford Motor Company, Motorola, Hewlett Packard, and Intel were reviewed. Commonalities between acquisition initiatives within these companies were identified as follows: early supplier involvement, centralized procurement, supplier monitoring and recognition, reduced number of suppliers, global sourcing, and long term <b>contractor</b> <b>relationships.</b> These initiatives were then compared to DCMC approaches and conclusions drawn regarding differences and recommendations made to improve DCMC procedures. Recommendations included; reducing DoD's supplier base through monitoring and reward, increasing use of long term supplier relationships, allowing global sourcing of products and refocusing on customer quality.

This paper investigates contractor classification methods that link clients’ selection aspirations and contractor performance. Multivariate techniques were used to study the intrinsic link between clients’ selection preferences, i. e. project-specific criteria (PSC) and their respective levels of importance assigned (LIA), during tender evaluation for modelling contractor classification models in a data set of 68 case studies of UK construction projects. The logistic regression (LR) and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) were used. Results revealed that both techniques produced a good prediction on contractor performance and indicated that suitability of the equipment, past performance in cost and time on similar projects, <b>contractor</b> <b>relationship</b> with local authority, and contractor reputation/image are the most predominant PSC in the LR and MDA models among the 34 PSC.
