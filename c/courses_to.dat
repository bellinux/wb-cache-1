5|$|Menominee Tribe v. United States is a {{landmark}} case in Native American law, {{primarily in the}} area of reserved tribal rights. It has been used in college <b>courses</b> <b>to</b> explain tribal sovereignty rights and that tribes retain some rights even if the tribe has been terminated, as the Menominee tribe was. The decision in the case has affected subsequent legislation, such as the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, in which Congress expressly extinguished all aboriginal rights. The case has been discussed internationally, for example in Australia regarding the relevance of indigenous or aboriginal title.|$|E

She subsequently started taking further <b>courses</b> <b>to</b> advance her career. During this time the children lived with other families during the week, seeing their mother only on weekends. Concerned about her children and parenting skills, she sought help for the family from a psychiatrist at St. Justine's Hospital in 1976; the assessment concluded {{there was nothing wrong}} with the shy and withdrawn Gamil, but recommended therapy for his sister Nadia, who was challenging her authority.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop <b>courses</b> <b>to</b> time slots in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning <b>courses</b> <b>to</b> time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E
