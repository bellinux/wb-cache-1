25|$|The LM324 (released in 1972) was {{one such}} op-amp {{that came in}} a quad package (four {{separate}} op-amps in one package) and became an industry standard. In addition to packaging multiple op-amps in a single package, the 1970s also saw the birth of op-amps in hybrid packages. These op-amps were generally improved versions of existing monolithic op-amps. As the properties of monolithic op-amps improved, the more <b>complex</b> <b>hybrid</b> ICs were quickly relegated to systems that are required to have extremely long service lives or other specialty systems.|$|E
500|$|Special effects {{supervisor}} Chris Corbould {{stated the}} scenes {{had to be}} extensively planned prior to filming specially to avoid any mishaps, going {{to the point of}} building protection above steps where cars would drive. [...] A car chase scene set {{along the banks of the}} Tiber River and through the streets of Rome featured an Aston Martin DB10 and a Jaguar C-X75. The C-X75 was originally developed as a hybrid electric vehicle with four independent electric engines powered by two jet turbines, before the project was cancelled. The version used for filming was converted to use a conventional internal combustion engine, to minimise the potential for disruption from mechanical problems with the <b>complex</b> <b>hybrid</b> system. The C-X75s used for filming were developed by the engineering division of Formula One racing team Williams, who built the original C-X75 prototype for Jaguar. Remote driving pods were built above the cars so the vehicles could be driven while the cameras focused on Craig and Bautista in the steering wheel. According to chief stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell, filming the chase had the [...] "risk of skidding into the Vatican", and led to [...] "a record for smashing up cars in Spectre – seven Aston Martins in all,” with the film's car expenses estimated at £24 million ($48 million).|$|E
