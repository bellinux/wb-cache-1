40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of new photovoltaic modules relies {{not only on the}} implementation of solar cells with higher performance but also on new module concepts such as an improved light management. This can be achieved by using optimized module components, i. e. back-sheets or connectors with special optical properties. Without changing much of the module design, a single modified component can lead to a performance gain when it causes additional light to reach the active cell region. A rapid test method is proposed which allows a quantitative estimate of the performance gain achieved by replacing one component by another. The method relies on special test structures making the setup of entire modules in the first product evaluation and development phase unnecessary.

In principle, contact defects (due to production faults or thermo-mechanical fatigue) in the DC circuit of a module can be named as potential sources of arcs during the operating lifetime. This work reflects general strategies for qualifying risks at <b>cell</b> <b>connectors</b> in general and transfers them to arcing risks in PV modules. To generate technical data, 20 crystalline PV modules with soldering defects were exposed to different test sequences to reproduce similar faults such as focal overheating or even electric arcs.

40|$|Genetically encoded {{fluorescent}} antibodies are {{desirable for}} many applications in biotechnology, proteomics, microscopy, cell biology and molecular diagnostics, although efficient production of fluorescent IgGs in mammalian cells has been hampered by different and mutually incompatible secretion- and folding-requirements of antibodies and green fluorescent protein-derived fluorescent entities.

40|$|In this paper, a micromachined double lumen {{microdialysis}} probe connector for on-line, in-vivo sampling is presented. The connector {{forms an}} integral part of a double lumen type microdialysis probe and guides the flow of sample fluid (‘dialysate’) directly into a flow cell with space for integrated sensors. Basically, the connector is a sandwich construction of two, multistep KOH etched silicon wafers which, after bonding allows the easy insertion of two concentric fused silica capillaries, required to construct the probe. For the experimental evaluation of the performance, in this work, a chloride selective sensor was integrated in the flow <b>cell</b> of the <b>connector</b> to continuously measure the chloride concentration in the dialysate flow. It will be shown that by adopting micromachining techniques, the induced lag time of the measurement can easily be decreased by a factor of more than 5, as compared to a conventional probe connected to a flow-through sensor. Another benefit of the proposed direct coupling of double lumen microdialysis probes and microfluidic structures in silicon, is the fact that all critical fluidic connections, especially the probe/sensor connection, are kept inside, making the microanalysis system more rigid...|$|R

40|$|Presented on February 23, 2011 from 4 - 5 pm in room G 011 of the Molecular Science and Engineering Building. Runtime: 64 : 31 minutesWe {{will present}} {{strategies}} for the fabrication of novel electrically functional structures from particles or gels operating in water environment. In {{the first part of}} the talk we will discuss how electric fields can be used to assemble metallic or dielectric particles and live <b>cells</b> into electrical <b>connectors,</b> networks and sensor prototypes. The structures formed include microwires from metallic nanoparticles, crystals with conductive lanes, and biocomposite membranes from live cells. We will demonstrate how Janus and patchy metallodielectric spheres can be assembled in new types of colloidal crystals and gels and how the type of structures formed can be precisely controlled by the induced frequency-dependent dipolar and quadrupolar interactions. In the second part of the talk we will discuss how water-based gels doped with polyelectrolytes can be used as the core of novel diodes, memristors and photovoltaic cells operating on the conductance of the counterionic layers around the gel molecular backbone. A new class of “soft” diodes with rectifying junction formed by interfacing water-based gels doped with polyelectrolytes of opposite charge was developed. These structures were recently used as a basis of a new class of memristors, composed entirely of soft and liquid matter by interfacing the gel stacks with liquid metal electrodes. We also demonstrated a radically new concept of bio-inspired hydrogel solar cells. The matrix of these photovoltaic cells is made of ionic agarose gels doped with photosensitive organic molecules. They have open circuit voltages and current density comparable to polymer photovoltaics. Such gel-based “artificial leaves” can be flexible, inexpensive and environmentally friendly...|$|R
40|$|The {{realization}} of complex 3 D tissue cultures on a chip requires {{the implementation of}} closed circulation systems. These consist of several cell culture segments, storage chambers and micro pumps. So far the fabrication was accomplished by casting a silicone flow <b>cell</b> to a <b>connector</b> plate. This process is complicated, expensive and difficult to automate. It also limits the microfluidic system to be designed {{in a single layer}} [1 - 3]. // We developed a closed process chain to manufacture inexpensive microfluidic chips in an automated and cost effective way. The novel system is a multilayer design based on laser micro structured foils. The first step is to slice the microfluidic system design into individual layers so that each layer can be fabricated on a separate foil. The next step is the selection of the desired properties (e. g. hydrophilic, transparent …) for each foil, which depends on the functional requirements. In the third step these foils are laser processed on both sides, i. e. they are micro structured and functionalized. The final fourth step is laminating these individual foils into a multilayered system via thermal or plasma bonding. The multilayer technology is also applied to fabricate pneumatically actuated pumps and valves. For this purpose the design of these elements has to be adapted. // Microfluidic structures can be placed at different levels in the multilayer design, which results in greater functionality per chip area. Surface properties can be tailored by using foils with different properties (hydrophilic, hydrophobic) in combination with laser structuring and laser functionalization. This enables the implementation of new functions such as capillary stop valves and the selective colonialization of specific are as with cells.

40|$|In {{the earlier}} {{days of the}} Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) industry, much effort was {{dedicated}} {{to the performance of}} device speed and number of transistors per processor core in response to Gordon Moore's law. However, the attention has gradually migrated to the system-level design, such as signaling and timing conventions for efficient data transactions. This is because the system clock speed is no longer limited by CMOS device cutoff frequencies, and the system performance becomes limited by either on- or off-chip interconnects. In order to overcome such difficulties, various ideas have been proposed including pre-distortion, equalization, and multi-level signaling. However, the burden on transferring data becomes dominant in overall system design as the demands for higher computing capabilities ever increase. My research focuses on maximizing the bandwidth efficiency by exploiting RF/Wireless techniques and minimizes the interconnect complexity. I explored 3 different hypotheses. 	The first case is an on- and off-chip communication through copper wires. When a point-to-point or point-to-multi-point communication is established, the data signal experiences discontinuities through vias and connectors. Then, it affects the channel frequency response with deep notches where the signal undergoes resonances. A typical solution would equalize the channel based on the worst case notch, but the penalty is the reduced signal to noise ratio (SNR). Instead of sacrificing SNR, I accept the channel impairments and send data where there is no such notches using RF modulation on top of baseband signal. 	The second case is a short-range wireless data communication through the air. Data connectors are everywhere in our daily lives. For instance, USB connectors in computers and <b>cell</b> phones, HDMI <b>connectors</b> in monitors and TVs. The mechanical parts are not only expensive but also bulky in size. Just as in first case, the high speed signal suffers discontinuities as well. Instead of struggling with mechanical parts, the wireless interconnect utilizes the abundant free-license band at 60 GHz and provides giga-bits-per second (Gb/s) data rate with a minimum complexity and power efficiency because of its nature in short-range communication. 	The last one is a mid-range (1 meter to 10 meter) data communication through plastic cables. In an example of data server communication market, the fiber optics has been a dominant solution because of the long-distance capability and large data bandwidth. However, it requires electrical to optical, and optical to electrical conversion with a strict temperature control. Keeping the advantage of low-loss channel characteristic, modulated RF signals can propagate through plastic tubes or strips without the cost of conversion process...|$|R
