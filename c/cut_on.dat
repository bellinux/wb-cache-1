5|$|Because of {{its large}} size and {{formidable}} defenses, The Pacific electric ray seldom falls prey to other animals. There {{is a record}} of one being fed upon by a killer whale (Orcinus orca) off Santa Catalina Island. The Cooper's nutmeg (Cancellaria cooperi) is a specialized parasite of this ray, and possibly other bottom-dwelling fishes such as the Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica). The snail is attracted to the chemicals contained in the ray's surface mucus; it makes a small <b>cut</b> <b>on</b> the ventral surface of the ray and uses its proboscis to suck blood. Other known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, the fluke Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium hispidum.|$|E

5|$|Diệm's {{government}} put Ba <b>Cụt</b> <b>on</b> trial. During the proceedings, Ba Cụt theatrically {{removed his}} shirt {{so that the}} public gallery could see how many scars he had suffered while fighting the communists. This, according to him, demonstrated his devotion to Vietnamese nationalism. He challenged any other man to show as many scars. The Diệmist judge was unimpressed. Ba Cụt {{was found guilty of}} multiple murders and sentenced to death. Diệm's adviser, Colonel Edward Lansdale from the CIA, was one of many who protested against the decision. Lansdale felt that the execution would tarnish Diệm—who had proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam) and declared himself President—and antagonise Ba Cụt's followers. Ngô Đình Nhu, Diệm's younger brother and chief adviser, denied a reprieve as the army, particularly Minh, opposed any clemency. Some sections of the southern public, however, were sympathetic to Ba Cụt.|$|E

Hamhuis additionally received the CHL Defenceman of the Year Award and was named to the WHL West and CHL First All-Star Teams. He was also named Prince George's most valuable player. Hamhuis left Prince George as the club's all-time leader in assists with 123 (he was later surpassed by Blake Robson on January 28, 2003).|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Warner {{played one}} {{professional}} football {{game for the}} Syracuse Athletic Club during the first World Series of Football at Madison Square Garden.

For the tournament, Warner and the other team members earned $23 (approximately $816 in 2016), although the expected share was $300 (approximately $8,000 in 2016) per player; it was a financial failure.|$|E

5|$|Norman Dolph's {{original}} acetate {{recording of}} the Scepter Studios material contains several recordings {{that would make it}} onto the final album, though many are different mixes of those recordings and three are different takes entirely. The acetate was <b>cut</b> <b>on</b> April 25, 1966, shortly after the recording sessions. It would resurface decades later when it was bought by collector Warren Hill of Montreal, Quebec, Canada in September 2002 at a flea market in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City for $0.75. Hill put the album up for auction on eBay in November. On December 8, 2006, a winning bid for $155,401 was placed, but not honored.

The woman was found on 11 July with 13 stab wounds, including a fatal throat wound, but was believed to have died the previous day. Behan, who had been resident in Arcidosso for part of the year since 2006, was arrested after seeking treatment twice at a hospital near Arcidosso for a <b>cut</b> <b>on</b> his thigh. In an interview with The Irish Times, he claimed he had first gone to the hospital on 10 July after cutting himself in the thigh while unpacking furniture and other objects delivered from the USA. However, hospital staff had mistakenly decided he had been acting suspiciously due to his poor spoken Italian, {{and the fact that he}} had expressed annoyance at how the hospital was managed and its bad signage.|$|E

Eli initially informs Oskar that they cannot be friends.

Håkan requests that Eli stop seeing Oskar. After questioning Oskar about a <b>cut</b> <b>on</b> his cheek, Eli learns that the boy is being bullied by schoolmates and encourages him to stand up for himself.

5|$|Sometime after Lochry's Defeat, Brant and Simon Girty {{got into}} an altercation along the Ohio River. According to {{contemporary}} gossip, Girty took exception to Brant's boasting about {{the success of the}} expedition, perhaps because Girty believed his brother George deserved more credit. The two men, who were reportedly drunk, came to blows, which ended when Brant slashed Girty in the head with his sword. The wound, which took several months to heal, left a scar on Girty's forehead. When Brant returned to Detroit in October, he had a sword <b>cut</b> <b>on</b> his leg, which had become infected and initially looked as if it would result in amputation. The wound was officially reported as accidentally self-inflicted, although gossipers said that it {{was the result of the}} fight with Girty. Brant's Iroquois companions returned home, but Brant was compelled to stay in Detroit over the winter in order to recover.|$|E
5|$|The Bodyline {{controversy}} {{continued into}} the 1933 season. Bodyline tactics were used in several matches, including by the West Indian tourists in the second Test. In all first-class cricket, Hammond, no longer vice-captain of Gloucestershire, scored 3,323 runs, passing 3,000 in a season for the first time. With an average of 67.81, he topped the first-class tables for {{what would be the}} first of eight successive seasons. He also took 38 wickets. However, his highest score in three Test innings was 34. In the second Test, unsettled by Bodyline, Hammond was <b>cut</b> <b>on</b> the chin by a short ball, causing him to retire hurt. He again commented that he would quit rather than face such bowling; soon after his return, he was out. Les Ames, who played in the three-match series, won by England 2–0, believed that the West Indian pacemen worried Hammond, who showed a weakness against short, fast bowling.|$|E
