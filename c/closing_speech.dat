5|$|Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking. After his <b>closing</b> <b>speech</b> at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925, {{one which}} was an ordeal for both him and his listeners, he began to see Lionel Logue, an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised {{breathing}} exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently. Subsequently, {{he was able to}} speak with less hesitation. With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during a tour of the empire in 1927. His journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.|$|E
5|$|The {{secret was}} not kept for long, and Gordon-Cumming demanded a {{retraction}} from the Wilson family, whom he considered {{to blame for}} divulging the news. They refused, and he filed a writ for slander in February 1891. Despite {{the efforts of the}} prince's courtiers to have the matter dealt with by a military court, the case was heard in June 1891. The atmosphere at trial was described as being like a theatre, and Edward was called as a witness, the first time the heir to the throne had been compelled to appear in court since 1411. Gordon-Cumming's senior counsel, the Solicitor General Sir Edward Clarke, did not persuade any of the defendants to change their stories, but he highlighted several inaccuracies and serious discrepancies in their evidence. Despite a strong and well-regarded <b>closing</b> <b>speech</b> by Clarke on Gordon-Cumming's behalf, the judge's summing up was described as biased by some, and the jury found against the lieutenant colonel.|$|E

25|$|May 1850 Revision – in May 1850 Wagner made a third fair copy of {{the text}} (Viertschrift des Textbuches) {{in the hopes of}} having it published. Unfortunately this manuscript, which is {{presently}} in the Bayreuth Archives, is fragmentary, some of its pages having been discarded during the next revision, for which it was the source-text. Among the missing pages are the final few, so it is impossible to tell whether either of the marginal verses added to the final page of the second fair copy was incorporated into Brünnhilde's <b>closing</b> <b>speech.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{weeks of}} negotiation, a debate between Salmond and Darling was arranged. The programme, titled as , was {{broadcast}} by STV on 5 August 2014. The debate, moderated by Bernard Ponsonby, saw both politicians make opening statements and cross-examine {{each other before}} taking questions from the audience. At {{the end of the}} clash, they were both given the chance to make a <b>closing</b> <b>speech.</b> Both campaign groups claimed victory in the debate. A snap poll conducted by ICM stated Darling won the debate by 56% to 44%. In his analysis of the ICM poll, Professor John Curtice detected little movement either way {{as a result of the}} debate.|$|E
25|$|In November and December 1852, Wagner made {{extensive}} {{revisions to}} the libretti of Der junge Siegfried and Siegfried's Tod. This was partly to accommodate {{the expansion of the}} cycle and the growing significance of Wotan, the protagonist of the first two parts of the tetralogy, and partly to reflect Wagner's reading of the philosophy of Ludwig Feuerbach (see below). The changes to Der junge Siegfried were entered into the first fair copy (Reinschrift des Textbuches), while those to Siegfried's Tod were entered into the third fair copy (Viertschrift des Textbuches). In each case several pages of the fair copy were replaced with newly written ones. The principal changes to Siegfried's Tod involved the opening scene of the prologue (the Norns scene), Brünnhilde's scene with Waltraute (which had originally included all nine Valkyries), and Brünnhilde's <b>closing</b> <b>speech</b> {{at the end of the}} opera.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with developing a speech synthesis subcomponent for perception testing {{in the context of}} evaluating cochlear implants in children. We provide a detailed requirements analysis, and develop a strategy for maximally high quality <b>speech</b> synthesis using <b>Close</b> Copy <b>Speech</b> synthesis techniques with a diphone based speech synthesiser, MBROLA. The close copy concept used in this work defines close copy as a function from a pair of speech signal recording and a phonemic annotation aligned with the recording into the pronunciation specification interface of the speech synthesiser. The design procedure has three phases: Manual <b>Close</b> Copy <b>Speech</b> (MCCS) synthesis as a ?best case gold standard?, in which the function is implemented manually as a preliminary step; Automatic <b>Close</b> Copy <b>Speech</b> (ACCS) synthesis, in which the steps taken in manual transformation are emulated by software; finally, Parametric <b>Close</b> Copy <b>Speech</b> (PCCS) synthesis, in which prosodic parameters are modifiable while retaining the diphones.

25|$|Stern hosted {{his final}} show on {{terrestrial}} radio on December 16, 2005. A stage was built outside the studio for Stern, his colleagues and Wack Pack members {{to make their}} farewell speeches. In his <b>closing</b> <b>speech,</b> Stern thanked the New York City Police Department, dedicating the show to Sergeant Keith Manning, a friend {{who at the time}} was serving in Iraq. When off the air, Stern traveled to the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square on an open-top bus and met Martha Stewart, who was broadcasting on her own Sirius channel, Martha Stewart Living Radio. Stern's contract with Infinity Broadcasting expired at midnight on December 31. The show was syndicated to as many as 60 markets across the United States and Canada, and gained a peak audience of 20 million listeners. In the New York market the show was the highest-rated morning program consecutively for seven years between 1994 and 2001. Stern's successor in various East Coast affiliates, The David Lee Roth Show, attracted a market share of 1.8% in January 2006, which was down from 7.9% that Stern acquired a month previous. Stern was replaced with The Adam Carolla Show on numerous West Coast affiliates, and the still airing Rover's Morning Glory in mostly Midwestern markets.|$|E

500|$|The {{co-operation}} between monarch and Parliament {{following the}} Gunpowder Plot was atypical. Instead, {{it was the}} previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides {{for the rest of}} the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity. On 7 July 1604, James had angrily prorogued Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies. [...] "I will not thank where I feel no thanks due", he had remarked in his <b>closing</b> <b>speech.</b> [...] "...I am not of such a stock as to praise fools... You see how many things you did not well... I wish you would make use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come".|$|E
500|$|The [...] "inconvenient journalist" [...] (giornalista scomodo) – as De Mauro {{had become}} known – was kidnapped and killed because the Mafia and their backers {{wanted to know}} his sources of {{confidential}} and potentially devastating information, public prosecutor Antonio Ingroia told the court in his <b>closing</b> <b>speech</b> in March 2011. [...] "The death sentence on De Mauro was passed because of a convergence of two elements," [...] Ingroia said. Riina, Bontade and Badalamenti decided to eliminate De Mauro because {{he was about to}} go public about Mattei's 1962 murder as a result of research for Francesco Rosi's landmark movie, as well as the fact the journalist had uncovered the plans for staging the Mafia-backed far-right Borghese coup d'état, thanks to his former wartime Fascist connections.|$|E

Hagen's main resolution proposal, titled En fremtid med rot i fortiden, was passed with 94 against 50 votes. He also received support for prioritizing anti-immigration higher in the following period. In his <b>closing</b> <b>speech,</b> Hagen stated that [...] "disloyal" [...] behavior would be considered as [...] "active withdrawal" [...] from the party. From the rostrum, the [...] "band of four" [...] was even asked to withdraw by several delegates, including Bjørn Andreassen, Gustav Hareide and Frøydis Lange. Andreassen exclaimed that [...] "we don't want you", while Lange asked the band of four {{to form a new}} party called the Anarchist Party.|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the episode, Liz dreams she is giving birth to Meat Cat, a fictional cartoon mascot for [...] "cheesy blasters", her favorite cheese snacks. This episode made reference to the mascot as it was first introduced in the fourth season's premiere episode [...] "Season 4". Many television reviewers have noted that Jack's presentation {{on how to deal with}} overbearing mothers, given the acronym [...] "ASQ" [...] (Always Speak Quietly), was a reference to Baldwin's [...] "ABC" [...] (Always Be <b>Closing)</b> <b>speech</b> seen in the film Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). The night vision video that Liz shows to her writing staff, in which she is seen sleepwalking, ordering a pizza and eating large amounts of junk food, was a parody of the 2009 horror film Paranormal Activity.|$|E
500|$|During the Joint Session these eminent psychiatrists, {{motivated}} by fear, had to publicly admit that their scientific positions were erroneous {{and they also}} had to promise to conform to [...] "Pavlovian" [...] doctrines. These public declarations of obedience proved insufficient. In the <b>closing</b> <b>speech</b> Snezhnevsky, the lead author of the Session's policy report, stated that the accused psychiatrists [...] "have not disarmed themselves and continue {{to remain in the}} old anti-Pavlovian positions", thereby causing [...] "grave damage to the Soviet psychiatric research and practice". The vice president of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences accused them of [...] "diligently worshipping the dirty source of American pseudo-science". Those who articulated these accusations at the Joint Session — among them Irina Strelchuk, Vasily Banshchikov, Oleg Kerbikov, and Snezhnevsky — were distinguished by their careerist ambition and fear for their own positions. Not surprisingly, many of them were promoted and appointed to leadership posts shortly after the session.|$|E
50|$|Lehrman’s {{most recent}} book, The Political Speechwriter’s Companion (CQPress 2009), draws on almost two hundred {{examples}} taken mostly from American political speeches {{to demonstrate how}} one structure and {{what he calls the}} LAWS of political speech - language, anecdote, wit, and support - can be effective in almost any political setting. In chapters that include speeches and excerpts annotated to show how each technique works, Lehrman analyzes how to be effective, whether on the stump, on the floor, or in ceremonial speeches ranging from commencements to eulogies to keynotes. He presents an original way to <b>close</b> <b>speeches</b> that has been compared to what Alan Monroe did for the motivated sequence.|$|R
50|$|The trial lasted 54 days in court. It {{began on}} 17 September with the {{indictment}} {{and the opening}} speech for the prosecution.

On 20 September, the British Army screened a film they had made of the conditions at Belsen immediately after liberation. On 21 September, the court visited Bergen-Belsen. Evidence for the defence began on 8 October with the opening speech for the defendant Kramer who also testified. <b>Closing</b> <b>speeches</b> were made from 7-12 November, followed by the closing arguments by the prosecution on 13 November.

500|$|In 1956, McGovern sought {{elective}} office himself, {{and ran for}} the House of Representatives from South Dakota's 1st congressional district, which consisted of the counties east of the Missouri River. He faced four-term incumbent Republican Party Representative Harold O. Lovre. Aided by the voter lists he had earlier accumulated, McGovern ran a low-budget campaign, spending $12,000 while borrowing $5,000. His quiet personality appealed to voters he met, while Lovre suffered from a general unhappiness over Eisenhower administration farm policy. When polls showed McGovern gaining, Lovre's campaign implied that McGovern's support for admitting the People's Republic of China to the United Nations and his past support for Henry Wallace meant that McGovern was a Communist appeaser or sympathizer. In his <b>closing</b> <b>speech,</b> McGovern responded: [...] "I have always despised communism and every other ruthless tyranny over the mind and spirit of man." [...] McGovern staged an upset victory, gaining 116,516 votes to his opponent's 105,835, and became the first Democrat elected to Congress from South Dakota in 22 years. The McGoverns established a home in Chevy Chase, Maryland.|$|E
500|$|In his <b>closing</b> <b>speech,</b> defence counsel {{said that}} the key to the case was whether the Orsborne {{brothers}} intended to deprive the owners permanently of their vessel. The evidence, he said, was more suggestive of a [...] "joy-ride half-way round the world", than of theft or anything more sinister. Prosecuting counsel argued that if the month's joy-ride was the innocent explanation, why had it been necessary to introduce into the case the unfounded allegations of proposed insurance fraud [...] "against men whose reputations were above suspicion?". In his summing up, the judge condemned the arrangements whereby the Orsbornes were receiving money from the press for the rights to their story. This was unwarranted and undesirable: [...] "Whether the two prisoners be guilty or innocent , the property of someone else was being used by them without permission...George Orsborne clearly knew that he was acting directly against his employer's interests". The jury was out for only 35 minutes before returning guilty verdicts against both defendants. On 22 October George Orsborne was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, and James to 12 months.|$|E
500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{started its}} <b>closing</b> <b>speech</b> by {{drawing attention to}} the [...] "cool and calculating" [...] {{manner in which the}} children were killed. [...] Knight also argued that the accused could not have shared the same delusion, and only brought it up during the trial. [...] The [...] "cunning and deliberation" [...] displayed in the acts could not have been done by a deluded person. [...] Tan helped Lim because [...] "she loved [...] ", and Hoe was simply misled into helping the crimes. [...] Urging the judges to consider the ramifications of their verdict, Knight said: [...] "My Lords, to say that Lim was less than a coward who preyed on little children because they could not fight back; killed them in the hope that he would gain power or wealth and therefore did not commit murder, is to make no sense of the law of murder. [...] It would lend credence to the shroud of mystery and magic he has conjured up his practices and by which he managed to frighten, intimidate and persuade the superstitious, the weak and the gullible into participating in the most lewd and obscene acts." ...|$|E
