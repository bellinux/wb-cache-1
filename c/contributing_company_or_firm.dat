50|$|<b>Companies</b> <b>or</b> <b>firms</b> {{that tend}} to get {{involved}} with the strategy of predatory pricing often have the goal to place restrictions or a barrier for other new businesses from entering the applicable market. It is an unethical act which contradicts anti-trust law, attempting to establish within the market a monopoly by the imposing Company. Predatory pricing mainly occurs during price competitions in the market as it is an easy way to obfuscate the unethical and illegal act. Using this strategy, in the short term consumers will benefit and be satisfied with lower cost products. In the long run, firms often will not benefit as this strategy will continue to be used by other businesses to undercut competitors margins, causing an increase in competition within the field and facilitating major losses. This strategy is dangerous as it could be destructive to a firm in terms of losses and even lead to complete business failure.|$|R

30|$|There {{are also}} sector {{differences}} in gender inequality. Firstly, although the overall income gap {{between men and}} women shows a trend of steadily increasing incomes, the gender wage gap in the public sector is narrower than that in the private sector (Wang et al. 2008; Li et al. 2014). Secondly, women working in the public sector benefit more from the social security policy. China’s labor security system is still immature during the transitional period, and as a result, it has not yet been effectively implemented in the private sector, which is poorly regulated. In some private <b>firms</b> <b>or</b> <b>companies</b> (small <b>firms</b> <b>or</b> <b>companies</b> in particular), profit-driven employers might even look for ways to cut maternal leave costs for their female employees, making it difficult for these women to secure their full benefits. In short, compared to the private sector, the public sector provides better benefits for women and better protection of women’s rights.|$|R
50|$|A {{business}} (also {{known as}} an enterprise, a <b>company</b> <b>or</b> a <b>firm)</b> is an organizational entity involved {{in the provision of}} goods and services to consumers. Businesses serve as conductors of economic activity, and are prevalent in capitalist economies, where most of them are privately owned and provide goods and services allocated through a market to consumers and customers in exchange for other goods, services, money, or other forms of exchange that hold intrinsic economic value. Businesses may also be social non-profit enterprises or state-owned public enterprises operated by governments with specific social and economic objectives. A business owned by multiple private individuals may form as an incorporated <b>company</b> <b>or</b> jointly organise as a partnership. Countries have different laws that may ascribe different rights to the various business entities.|$|R

50|$|Review testing {{approach}} and documentation: Many <b>companies</b> <b>or</b> external audit <b>firms</b> mistakenly attempted to impose generic frameworks over unique transaction-level processes or across locations.

In addition, IT security controls (a subset of ITGC) and shared service controls can be placed in separate process documentation, enabling more efficient assignment of test responsibility and removing redundancy across locations. Testing the key journal entries and account reconciliations as separate efforts enables additional efficiency and focus {{to be brought to}} these critical controls.|$|R
5000|$|The {{financial}} {{relationship between}} the product <b>company</b> <b>or</b> entertainment <b>firm</b> and the reviewer is not always as obvious as a cash payment.

This privileged access to the product may lead the reviewer to do a biased review, either {{out of a sense of}} obligation, or because of a concern that the failure to produce a [...] "puff piece" [...] will lead to the loss of future preview privileges. In some cases, the potential for bias in invitation-only preview sessions is substantially heightened when the reviewers are flown in to the location for the review, given fancy hotel rooms, and provided catered food and drinks during the actual review. The most egregious cases of this situation occur when, instead of inviting the reviewers to the <b>company</b> headquarters <b>or</b> another logical venue, the company gives all-expense paid tickets to Hawaii or Mexico, and holds the preview screening of the film or the product launch there.|$|R
