The construction of perforated inertial-returning pan, which was installed in the disk <b>comminuter</b> of forage combine, has been developed. The study results have been introduced in the make of KKN- 4 corn combine. The effectiveness is the decrease of specific energy consumption of comminution during the mounting of perforated pan instead of inertial-returning pan by 15 - 20 %.

40|$|Comparative {{tests of}} 4 systems for {{harvesting}} vineyard pruning residues {{were carried out}} using 1) a square baler; 2) a round baler; 3) a <b>comminuter</b> (or shredder) with drop-down re-usable containers (big bags); 4) a <b>comminuter</b> with built-in dumping bin. All machines were light enough for towing or carrying behind compact vineyard tractors. The machines were tested in Central Italy, on 10 ha of hill vineyard, with slope gradients ranging from 20 to 35 %. The tests included forwarding the processed residue to a central storage place 3 km away. Harvesting-processing productivity ranged from 1. 1 to 1. 7 t per scheduled machine hour (SMH), including all delays. Calculated harvesting-processing costs varied between 19. 7 and 32. 3 € t- 1, but increased from 53. 0 and 105. 2 € t- 1 when forwarding the residues to a central collection point was included. The additional cost of residue management could amount to about 25 € t- 1 (50 € ha- 1 for 2 t ha- 1). The commercial viability of recovering vineyard pruning residue also depends on the eventual redistribution of the savings accrued on residue management. The studied systems offered different products: systems 1 and 2 produced bales, which are easier to store, but are not suited for the feeding of automated furnaces, unless they are further processed into chips. However, systems 3 and 4 produced chips, which {{are more difficult to}} store but can be fed to automated furnaces without any further processing. © 2009 IAgrE...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Comminuted</b> {{subtrochanteric}} fractures {{have been}} a challenge for orthopedic {{surgeons in terms of}} appropriate reduction and stable fixation. Numerous methods have been used for the fixation of <b>comminuted</b> subtrochanteric fractures among which some are accompanied with technical difficulties and complications of their own. Regarding the results of previous studies, we decided to evaluate the biological fixation method in <b>comminuted</b> subtrochanteric fractures. Methods: In this prospective study, we evaluated 20 men with <b>comminuted</b> subtrochanteric femoral fractures. The patients underwent indirect reduction with dynamic hip screw (DHS) or dynamic condylar screw (DCS) fixation within one week of injury. The patients were evaluated clinically for pain, hip and knee range of motion, leg-length discrepancy and angular and rotational deformities, in addition the radiographic assessment of the union. Results: According to Seinsheimer's classification of subtrochanteric fractures, four patients had type III, nine had type IV and seven had type V fractures. Fracture fixation was performed by DCS in eight and by DHS in 12 cases. The average time of the operations was 79. 4 (ranging from 60 - 125) minutes. Mean blood loss was 634 (ranging from 340 - 1160) milliliters. Uneventfully, union occurred in all patients with no clinical pain or dysfunction. Conclusion: Submuscular plating with either DCS or DHS is a viable option to treat <b>comminuted</b> subtrochanteric fractures. The results of this study highly suggest use of submuscular plating in the treatment of <b>comminuted</b> subtrochanteric fractures, especially in the third world countries...|$|R

40|$|<b>Comminuted</b> {{fractures}} of {{the middle}} phalanx have been well described in the horse. Choice of treatment, surgical planning and prognosis have traditionally been based upon evaluation of radiographs. However, the complex nature of <b>comminuted</b> fractures makes radiographic interpretation difficult. Computed tomography (CT) allows the production of cross-sectional images with spatial separation of structures which are superimposed on survey radiographs. This allows accurate assessment of the number and direction of fracture lines within the bone.

Buckley demonstrated that Sanders type IV fractures have poor outcomes with either operative or non-operative treatment [47]. Several proposed reasons are: in <b>comminuted</b> fractures anatomical reconstruction of the posterior articular facet is not usually possible [10]; in high-energy injuries irreversible cartilage damage occurs {{at the time of}} fracture [59]; post-traumatic arthrosis is reported as high as 71 % and the need for secondary fusion is 5.5 times higher in this subgroup [60].|$|R
