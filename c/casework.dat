25|$|The {{practice}} and profession {{of social work}} has a relatively modern and scientific origin, and is generally considered to have developed out of three strands. The first was individual <b>casework,</b> a strategy pioneered by the Charity Organization Society in the mid-19th century, which was founded by Helen Bosanquet and Octavia Hill in London, England. Most historians identify COS as the pioneering organization of the social theory {{that led to the}} emergence of social work as a professional occupation. COS had its main focus on individual <b>casework.</b> The second was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief – 'relief of paupers'. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English Poor Laws of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organization Society. The third consisted of social action – rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby alleviate poverty. This approach was developed originally by the Settlement House Movement.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{recurrence}} of fingermark dating {{issues and the}} research conducted on fingermark composition and aging, no dating methodology has yet been developed and validated. In order to further evaluate the possibility of developing dating methodologies based on the fingermark composition, this research proposed an in-depth study of the aging of target lipid parameters found in fingermark residue and exposed to different in fluence factors. The selected analytical technique was gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The effects of donor, substrate and enhancement techniques on the selected parameters were firstly evaluated. These factors were called known factors, as their value could be obtained in real <b>caseworks.</b> Using principal component analysis (PCA) and univariate exponential regression, this study highlighted {{the fact that the}} effects of these factors were larger than the aging effects, thus preventing the observation of relevant aging patterns. From a fingermark dating perspective, the specific value of these known factors should thus be included in aging models newly built for each case. Then, the effects of deposition moment, pressure, temperature and lighting were also evaluated. These factors were called unknown factors, as their specific value would never be precisely obtained in <b>caseworks.</b> Aging models should thus be particularly robust to their effects and for this reason, different chemometric tools were tested: PCA, univariate exponentialregression and partial least square regression(PLSR). While the first two models allowed observing interesting aging patterns regardless {{of the value of the}} applied influence factors, PLSR gave poorer results, as large deviations were obtained. Finally, in order to evaluate the potential of such modelling in realistic situations, blind analyses were carried out on eight test fingermarks. The age of five of them was correctly estimated using soft independent modelling of class analogy analysis (SIMCA) based on PCA classes, univariate exponential linear regression and PLSR. Furthermore, a probabilistic approach using the calculation of likelihood ratios (LR) through the construction of a Bayesian network was also tested. While the age of all test fingermarks were correctly evaluated when the storage conditions were known, the results were not significant when these conditions were unknown. Thus, this model clearly highlighted the impact of storage conditions on correct age evaluation. This research showed that reproducible aging modelling could be obtained based on fingermark residue exposed to influence factors, as well as promising age estimations. However, the proposed models are still not applicable in practice. Further studies should be conducted concerning the impact of influence factors (in particular, storage conditions) in order to precisely evaluate in which conditions significant evaluations could be obtained. Furthermore, these models should be properly validated before any application in real <b>caseworks</b> could be envisaged...|$|R

Variation was also observed between autofluorescence profiles of epidermal cell populations from a single contributor sampled on different days. This dataset suggests that red autofluorescence may be a useful marker for identifying distinct cell populations in some mixtures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to reconsider Korean judicial mediation as a part of alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) and to discuss the possible legal transition of Korean judicial mediation into private sector mediation. Similar to other states’ judicial problems, Korea has also faced overloaded case dockets, congestion of the civil process, an expensive legal process, and emotional stress on parties during the procedures. The Korean judicial authority continuously developed the Korean mediation programs, which can be categorized as court-related mediation, including court-annexed and court-connected mediations. Based on enactment of the Judicial Conciliation of Civil Disputes Act of 1990 (“JCCDA”), the Korean Supreme Court launched the Court-annexed Mediation Center (“CMC”) as a pilot program in 2009 and expanded this program in 2011 {{in order to reduce the}} overloaded <b>caseworks</b> and provide better legal services to the public.

40|$|Abstract: The dog is {{the most}} common {{domestic}} animal in human environments and in many situations a dog may be a victim, a perpetrator or a link between a suspect and a crime scene. Therefore, biological material derived from dogs may constitute evidence in forensic <b>caseworks</b> and it may be necessary or helpful to obtain genetic profiles that would aid indi-vidual identification. Currently, the assessment of the genetic diversity of breeds, population structure, inbreeding, and the development of methodologies for population assignment are important areas of research in dogs and related species such as the grey wolf. Therefore, canine short tandem repeat (STR) -based genotyping is used by a significant number of popu-lation geneticists; however, for reasons we present here, it is utilized by {{a relatively small number of}} forensic practitio-ners. An extensive bibliographic search revealed a highly fragmented canine genotyping community working under less than well defined standards. In this work, we discuss the present developments and limitations of STR-based canine geno-typing. Furthermore, we recommend that a collaborative strategy for the implementation of standardization and harmoni-zation is crucial to the development of forensic canine genotyping...|$|R
40|$|Genetic markers {{represent}} {{a very important}} tool in forensic identification <b>caseworks,</b> in family relationships {{as well as in}} criminal analysis. The discrimination power of current genetic polymorphisms is so high that the inferential process can be efficiently used even in cases where direct knowledge on the genetic data of one of the terms in comparison is lacking. However in some cases despite the use of Probabilistic Expert Systems (FINEX) it is not always possible to achieve an acceptable percentage of paternity probability. Certainly one of these cases is the request to verify the relationship between two half-siblings of different gender in the absence of data from parents. In these cases {{it is not possible to}} use important tools such as polymorphisms of sexual chromosomes, so that the only possible approach is to increase the number of autosomal STRs. Therefore the authors decided to investigate 36 pairs of halfsiblings with known relationships from different parts of Italy, using a high number of autosomal STRs. The aim of this study is to verify whether, increasing the number of autosomal STRs analyzed, the application of PES allows to achieve an acceptable value of paternity probability without availability of parents’ profiles...|$|R
40|$|Genetic markers, {{defined as}} {{variable}} regions of DNA, can be utilized for distinguishing individuals or populations. As long as markers are independent, {{it is easy}} to combine the information they provide. For nonrecombinant sequences like mtDNA, choosing the right set of markers for forensic applications can be difficult and requires careful consideration. In particular, one wants to maximize the utility of the markers. Until now, this has mainly been done by hand. We propose an algorithm that finds the most informative subset of a set of markers. The algorithm uses a depth first search combined with a branch-and-bound approach. Since the worst case complexity is exponential, we also propose some data-reduction techniques and a heuristic. We implemented the algorithm and applied it to two forensic <b>caseworks</b> using mitochondrial DNA, which resulted in marker sets with significantly improved haplotypic diversity compared to previous suggestions. Additionally, we evaluated the quality of the estimation with an artificial dataset of mtDNA. The heuristic is shown to provide extensive speedup at little cost in accuracy.
