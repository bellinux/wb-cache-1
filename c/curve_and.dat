5|$|A flow is {{a process}} in which the points of a {{mathematical}} space continuously change their locations or properties over time. More specifically, in a one-dimensional geometric flow such as the curve-shortening flow, the points undergoing the flow belong to a <b>curve,</b> <b>and</b> what changes is the shape of the curve, its embedding into the Euclidean plane determined by the locations of each of its points.|$|E

For instance, if a lemniscate (any smooth immersed curve {{with a single}} crossing, resembling a figure 8 or infinity symbol) has unequal areas in its two lobes, then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point. However, if the two lobes have equal areas, then they will remain equal throughout {{the evolution of the}} <b>curve,</b> <b>and</b> the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as the curve collapses to a singularity.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{parameterizing}} nearly arbitrary implicit plane/space <b>curves</b> <b>and</b> surfaces is introduced.

5|$|Now {{returning}} to its pre-Kensington route, NY33 follows a six-lane, divided Genesee Street past the airport {{on one side}} and numerous associated businesses such as hotels and fast food restaurants on the other. The large aerospace contractor Calspan has its headquarters here, and Westinghouse once operated a large industrial lathe plant on the airport side of the road (it was torn down when the airport was rebuilt in the late 1990s). Beyond the airport, the divider ends, the travel lanes are reduced to four and, after a short <b>curve</b> <b>and</b> minimal descent, NY33 intersects Transit Road (NY78) and enters the town of Lancaster. After this junction, the highway becomes a two-lane route once again through the small hamlet of Bowmansville, where it crosses Ellicott Creek near some rapids.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} reserve the {{advantages}} of Bézier model and improve the shape adjustability of <b>curves</b> <b>and</b> surfaces, scholars have constructed many Bézier <b>curves</b> <b>and</b> surfaces with shape parameters [11 – 18]. The common features of these <b>curves</b> <b>and</b> surfaces are as follows: (1) they inherit most of properties of Bézier <b>curves</b> <b>and</b> surfaces; (2) they all have shape parameters used to adjust the shape of these <b>curves</b> <b>and</b> surfaces handily; (3) the absence of rational fractions in their expressions makes them simpler than rational Bézier <b>and</b> NURBS <b>curves</b> <b>and</b> surfaces. Thus these <b>curves</b> <b>and</b> surfaces have extensive applications in describing complex <b>curves</b> <b>and</b> surfaces. However, the expressions of these Bézier <b>curves</b> <b>and</b> surfaces with shape parameters are polynomials; and consequently, they face the problem of smooth continuity in constructing complex <b>curves</b> <b>and</b> surfaces. Therefore, when researchers defined their <b>curves</b> <b>and</b> surfaces with shape parameters in [11 – 15], they also further studied the C 1, C 2 or G 1, G 2 continuity conditions of their proposed curves, but the continuity conditions of these surfaces have not been studied until now (note: the continuity conditions of the surfaces in [16 – 18] are also not studied). Compared with the research on smooth continuity between Bézier curves with shape parameters, the corresponding research on Bézier surfaces with shape parameters has not been extensively done and the relevant research results are relatively few. In this paper, we make some improvements to the Bézier-like surfaces in [17] and construct a kind of high-order generalized Bézier-like surfaces associated with multiple shape parameters. To improve the ability of describing complex surfaces by using the proposed surfaces, we lay emphasis {{on the study of}} G 2 continuity conditions of these surfaces.|$|R

He went on to win gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past Guillemot on the final <b>curve</b> <b>and</b> improving his personal best by over a minute, the cross country race, beating Sweden's Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams.

5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the least}} symmetric curve of constant width according to two different measures of central asymmetry, the Kovner–Besicovitch measure (ratio of area to the largest centrally symmetric shape enclosed by the <b>curve)</b> <b>and</b> the Estermann measure (ratio of area to the smallest centrally symmetric shape enclosing the curve). For the Reuleaux triangle, the two centrally symmetric shapes that determine the measures of asymmetry are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters that split its area more unevenly than any other curve of constant width. That is, the maximum ratio of areas {{on either side of}} a diameter, another measure of asymmetry, is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves of constant width.|$|E

5|$|Using {{a program}} called Blendanal, similar to the Blender {{technique}} used to verify the planets discovered by Kepler, the astronomers observing HAT-P-33 hoped to rule out false positive alternatives that could explain the planet-like signal seen in HAT-P-33's light <b>curve</b> <b>and</b> radial velocity. The use of Blendanal ruled out the possibilities that the signal was caused by that of a hierarchical triple star or a mixture between a bright star and a binary star in the background. The possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star whose secondary companion is too dim to be distinguishable from the brighter star could not be ruled out. However, the data indicated that the planet HAT-P-33b did indeed exist.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} first game of their Adams Division semi-final to the Quebec Nordiques in {{overtime}}, the Canadiens won ten overtime games en route to the title, setting an NHL record for most consecutive overtime victories in a playoff year. As with the 1986 championship, the team was led by Roy, who won his second Conn Smythe Trophy. The defining moment of the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals occurred in the second game, with less than two minutes to play and Montreal trailing the series 1–0 and the game 2–1. Attempting to gain an advantage for his team, head coach Jacques Demers called for a measurement of Los Angeles Kings forward Marty McSorley's stick. Referee Kerry Fraser determined that the blade had an illegal <b>curve,</b> <b>and</b> assessed a penalty against McSorley. Montreal scored on the power play to tie the game, and then won in overtime 3–2, to tie the series. Montreal also won Games 3 and 4 in overtime before eliminating the Kings in Game 5, 4–1. The celebration was marred by one of the worst riots in Montreal history, as fans rioted through downtown Montreal causing over $2.5million in property damage and 168 injuries.|$|E

5|$|Development of Dota 2 {{began in}} 2009 when IceFrog, the pseudonymous lead {{designer}} of the original Defense of the Ancients mod, was hired by Valve to create a modernized sequel. Dota 2 was officially released on Steam for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux-based personal computers in July 2013, following a Windows-only public beta phase that began two years prior. Despite some criticism going towards its steep learning <b>curve</b> <b>and</b> complexity, the game was praised for its rewarding gameplay, production quality, and faithfulness to its predecessor. The game initially used the original Source game engine until it was ported to Source 2 in 2015, making it the first game to use it. Since its release, Dota 2 {{has been one of}} the most played games on Steam, with over a million concurrent players at its peak. The popularity of the game has led to official merchandise being produced for it, including apparel, accessories, and toys, as well as promotional tie-ins to other games and media. The game also allows for the community to create custom game modes, maps, and hero cosmetics, which are uploaded to the Steam Workshop and curated by Valve.|$|E
5|$|For a more {{accurate}} computation of the mass-radius relationship and limiting mass of a white dwarf, one must compute the equation of state which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material. If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius {{from the center of}} the star, the system of equations consisting of the hydrostatic equation together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass., eq. (80) Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the radius becomes zero at a finite value of the mass. This is the limiting value of the mass—called the Chandrasekhar limit—at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue <b>curve)</b> <b>and</b> relativistic (green curve) models of a white dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold Fermi gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, , has been set equal to 2. Radius is measured in standard solar radii and mass in standard solar masses.|$|E

This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips <b>curve</b> <b>and</b> the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E
