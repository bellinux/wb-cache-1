5000|$|... β-Alanine is the rate-limiting {{precursor}} of <b>carnosine,</b> {{which is to}} say <b>carnosine</b> levels are limited by the amount of available β-alanine, not histidine. Supplementation with β-alanine has been shown to increase the concentration of <b>carnosine</b> in muscles, decrease fatigue in athletes and increase total muscular work done. Simply supplementing with <b>carnosine</b> is not as effective as supplementing with β-alanine alone since <b>carnosine,</b> when taken orally, is broken down during digestion to its components, histidine and β-alanine. Hence, by weight, only about 40% of the dose is available as β-alanine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carnosine</b> and {{carnitine}} {{were discovered}} by Russian chemist Vladimir Gulevich. Researchers in Britain, South Korea, Russia {{and other countries}} have shown that <b>carnosine</b> {{has a number of}} antioxidant properties that may be beneficial. <b>Carnosine</b> has been proven to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as alpha-beta unsaturated aldehydes formed from peroxidation of cell membrane fatty acids during oxidative stress. <b>Carnosine</b> is also a zwitterion, a neutral molecule with a positive and negative end.|$|E
50|$|Currently, the avian-reptilian enzyme encoded by HNMT-like gene {{is labeled}} as <b>carnosine</b> N-methyltransferase in public databases, while the {{mammalian}} methyltransferase is named <b>carnosine</b> N-methyltransferase.|$|E
50|$|N-Acetylcarnosine (NAC) is a {{naturally}} occurring compound chemically {{related to the}} dipeptide <b>carnosine.</b> The NAC molecular structure is identical to <b>carnosine</b> with the exception that it carries an additional acetyl group. The acetylation makes NAC more resistant to degradation by carnosinase, an enzyme that breaks down <b>carnosine</b> to its constituent amino acids, beta-alanine and histidine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carnosine</b> can {{increase}} the Hayflick limit in human fibroblasts, as well as appearing to reduce the telomere shortening rate. <b>Carnosine</b> is also considered as a geroprotector.|$|E
50|$|Like carnitine, <b>carnosine</b> is {{composed}} of the root word carn, meaning flesh, alluding to its prevalence in animal protein. A vegetarian (especially vegan) diet provides less <b>carnosine,</b> compared to levels found in a more typical diet including meat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carnosine</b> can chelate {{divalent}} metal ions.|$|E

50|$|The gene {{encoding}} this enzyme {{has been}} identified by Jakub Drozak an coworkers in 2010. The gene encoding the <b>Carnosine</b> synthase is ATPGD1, {{a member of the}} “ATP-grasp family” of ligases.

5000|$|Carnosinemia, {{a disease}} of excess <b>carnosine</b> due to an enzyme defect/deficiency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carnosine</b> is a {{dipeptide}} {{composed of}} beta-alanine and histidine, and {{is found in}} skeletal muscle and cells of the nervous system. This disorder results in an excess of <b>carnosine</b> in the urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood and nervous tissue. Neurological disorders associated with a deficiency of carnosinase, and the resulting carnosinemia ("carnosine in the blood") are common.|$|E

50|$|<b>Carnosine</b> {{acts as an}} antiglycating agent, {{reducing}} the rate of formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) (substances {{that can be a}} factor in the development or worsening of many degenerative diseases, such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, chronic renal failure, and Alzheimer's disease), and ultimately reducing development of atherosclerotic plaque build-up. Chronic glycolysis is speculated to accelerate aging, making <b>carnosine</b> a candidate for therapeutic potential.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carnosine</b> and {{metabolic}} derivatives of <b>carnosine,</b> including NAC, {{are found}} {{in a variety of}} tissues but particularly muscle tissue. These compounds have varying degrees of activity as free radical scavengers. NAC is particularly active against lipid peroxidation in the different parts of the lens in the eye. It is the active ingredient of eye drops used in order to prevent or treat cataracts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carnosine</b> and {{blueberry}} extract together synergistically improved {{proliferation of}} human stem cells in vitro by 83%.|$|E

50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and <b>carnosine,</b> whereas its two {{products are}} S-adenosylhomocysteine and anserine.|$|E
50|$|The 3 {{substrates}} of this enzyme are ATP, L-histidine, and beta-alanine, whereas its 3 {{products are}} ADP (previously thought to form AMP), diphosphate, and <b>carnosine.</b>|$|E
