5|$|On September 12, 1912, the new library {{opened on}} the {{property}} near Willamette University and the Oregon State Capitol, though construction on the structure was not completed, {{and much of the}} furniture had not been installed in the building. The completed structure included hardwood floors, <b>crown</b> <b>molding,</b> windows that were two-stories tall, and a fireplace. The library cost $30,000 to build, and within a year of operating had expanded to serve nearly 7,700 patrons with a collection of nearly 10,500 books. On January 4, 1920, a small fire damaged the furnace room and about 50 books at the library.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the 1883 room has been restored to its original appearance. The red oak floor is trimmed by nine inches of mop board and quarter-round, decoratively accented. The two curved and semi-circular front walls mark the two coat rooms in the original, one-room building. The rounded walls hold a chair rail and are wainscoted below the blackboards. Blackboards cover available space on the north, east, and south walls. Pressed tin extends over the ceiling and {{is used as a}} <b>crown</b> <b>molding</b> around the room on the walls from the ceiling {{to the top of the}} blackboards.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden <b>crown</b> <b>molding.</b> Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E

When the concave part is uppermost, {{it is called}} a cyma recta but if the convex portion is at the top, it is called a Cyma reversa — The <b>crowning</b> <b>molding</b> at the entablature is of the cyma form, it is called a cymatium.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} main courtroom {{is located}} on the second floor. The walls are covered with full-height paneled oak wainscot. The wainscot has a dentil-molded <b>crown</b> <b>mold.</b> The wood panel behind the judge's bench is simple with four fluted engaged pilasters and simple panels between. Most of the furnishings are original, {{with the exception of the}} jury box. The plaster ceiling is arched and of original height.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two classes}} of pieces: men and kings. Men are single pieces. Kings consist of two men of the same colour, stacked {{one on top of}} the other. The bottom piece is {{referred}} to as crowned (or kinged in the U.S.). Some sets have pieces with a <b>crown</b> <b>molded,</b> engraved or painted on one side, allowing the player to simply turn the piece over or to place the crown-side up on the crowned man, further differentiating kings from men. Pieces are often manufactured with indentations to aid stacking.|$|R

25|$|The Wynkoop House is a well-preserved {{example of}} a stone house {{that is not only}} Dutch but has stylistic touches {{distinctive}} to Ulster County as well, most notably in the gabled roof ends (elsewhere, gambrel roofs were preferred). On the outside, locally quarried limestone was used as the facing, as opposed to the cut sandstone seen in houses further south in the region. Inside, the <b>crown</b> <b>molding</b> and exposed floorboards are another regional hallmark.|$|E
500|$|Containing [...] each, the 24th and 25th floors {{were used}} as a {{penthouse}} apartment for Rodman Wanamaker, consisting of five bedrooms, six baths, and outdoor terraces. The rooms featured hardwood floors, marble fireplaces, and detailed cast-plaster <b>crown</b> <b>molding.</b> Originally the penthouse apartment was to be for Rodman Wanamaker and his wife but Wanamaker died in 1928 before the building was completed. Rodman Wanamaker's wife lived there only briefly, as {{she did not like}} the ringing bell in the tower overhead. The penthouse floors were converted to office use in 2000 by creative agency Red Tettemer + Partners. The firm Agoos/Lovera Architects modernized the basic office space on the 24th floor while preserving the ornate molding and materials that decorate the rest of the former penthouse space.|$|E

50|$|The old St. Mary's Rectory is a gable-front 2-story frame {{dwelling}} {{of three}} by three bays, built in 1849 and enlarged to twice its size in 1856, and located in Aquasco, Prince George's County, Maryland. The structure is significant for its architecture {{and for its}} association {{with the history of}} St. Paul's Parish and the community of Aquasco. The rectory is an excellent example of a vernacular building with Greek Revival and Italianate stylistic elements. The floor plan exemplifies a style typical of the dwellings of successful landowners and merchants on the mid 19th century in Prince George's County. Original Greek Revival style elements include the front gable entrance facade, <b>crown</b> <b>molded</b> returned cornice, porch detail, interior stair detail, door and window surrounds, and the parlor mantel. Italianate elements include the heavy bracketing of the exterior cornice and the tripartite window in the north gable end.|$|R

2500|$|During the Truman White House {{reconstruction}} {{that began}} in 1949, the East Room {{was found to be}} in very poor condition. Previous renovations had seriously damaged the interior walls. In one [...] section of wall, no fewer than five doors had been cut through the masonry, severely weakening it. Paneling, windows, and furnishings were dismantled, numbered, and stored. Although great care was taken in removing the plasterwork, {{there was no way to}} avoid cracking it during removal. Molds were made from the originals, and new plasterwork installed. Even so, architect Lorenzo Winslow simplified many of the designs before they were cast, allegedly to make them look less Renaissance Revival and more [...] "American". Less care was taken in removing the woodwork, some of which was damaged when pried loose. Other pieces were too brittle to be reused, and what could be reused had to be restored (often by removing many layers of paint). But by late 1951, with the White House renovation months behind, costs soaring, and President Truman demanding that the work be sped up, workers found it easier to machine new pieces than restore old wood. All of the paneling for the East Room was condemned as unfit for reuse, whether it was actually unusable or not, and replaced with new wood. (Although some of the East Room woodwork would be chopped up for souvenirs, most of it was used as landfill at Fort Myer in Arlington County, Virginia.) The new panelling was also simpler and had considerably less presence, and was covered in a somewhat lighter color than the 1902 paint. A simpler <b>crown</b> <b>molding</b> and ceiling medallions were also installed. The Herter pilasters and Piccirilli marble panels were either lost or too damaged to be reused during removal, and their fate remains unclear. To cut costs, the replacement entablature was made of a composite glue and sawdust mixture pressed into forms rather than carved from wood. While the feeling was similar, the robust architectural effect was diminished. Red marble mantels were installed, and the remaining Venetian window in the room was narrowed to help create the [...] "American" [...] feel. (The 1902 mantels were given away.) The East Room's chandeliers were rewired and cleaned. The size of the large chandeliers was reduced by several inches, assuming their correct size ( [...] wide and [...] high). They were also outfitted with softer internal illumination, and the chains holding the chandeliers shortened. The East Room also had a new parquet floor in a style taken from a design at the Palace of Fontainebleau, and silk curtains over the windows.|$|E

50|$|The main, {{original}} courtroom {{is located}} {{in the center of the}} 2nd floor. A wood panel wainscot to 4-foot height encircles the room. The wainscot is ornamented with fluted columns at 2-foot intervals, thus the wainscot mirrors the fluted pilasters of the walls and matches the original courtroom furniture. The north and south walls are accented with fluted plaster engaged pilasters. The plaster <b>crown</b> <b>mold</b> is in the form of a band with blue rectangular fields highlighted with gold. Above each pilaster the blue rectangle is larger and contains a scroll design; between the pilasters the rectangles are smaller and have a sheaf design. Perhaps the most striking feature of the courtroom is the mural behind the rostrum. The mural, painted by artist Xavier Gonzales, is Belgian linen on canvas using zinc white, earth and cadmium colors. The setting is characteristic of the environment of Huntsville and includes five figures symbolizing different phases of society. The figures represent youth, scientific agriculture, work, artistic endeavors and motherhood. The mural was commissioned by the Section of Painting and Sculpture and was installed October 27, 1937.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{test the}} {{strength}} to failure and fracture mode of three indirect composite materials directly applied onto Ti- 6 Al- 4 V implant abutments vs cemented standard porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) crowns. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four locking taper abutments were randomly allocated to four groups and were cleaned in ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min. After drying under ambient conditions, the abutments were grit blasted and a custom 4 -cusp molar <b>crown</b> <b>mold</b> was utilized to produce identical crowns (n = 16 per group) of Tescera (Bisco), Ceramage (Shofu), and Diamond Crown (DRM) according to the manufacturer`s instructions. The porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns were fabricated by conventional means involving the construction and a wax pattern and casting of a metallic coping followed by sintering of increasing layers of porcelain. All crowns were loaded to failure by an indenter placed {{at one of the}} cusp tips at a 1 mm/min rate. Subsequently, fracture analysis was performed by means of stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. One-way ANOVA at 95 % level of significance was utilized for statistical analysis. Results: The single load to failure (+/- SD) results were: Tescera (1130 +/- 239 N), Ceramage (1099 +/- 257 N), Diamond Crown (1155 +/- 284 N), and PFM (1081 +/- 243 N). Stereomicroscopy analysis showed two distinct failure modes, where the loaded cusp failed either with or without abutment/metallic coping exposure. SEM analysis of the fractures showed multiple crack propagation towards the cervical region of the crown below a region of plastic deformation at the indenter contact region. Conclusion: The three indirect composites and PFM systems fractured at loads higher than those typically associated with normal occlusal function. Although each material had a different composition and handling technique, {{no significant differences were found}} concerning their single load to fracture resistance among composite systems and PFM...|$|R
50|$|The Lexington federal {{building}} has two ornamental, oval-shaped entry lobbies at {{the southeast and}} southwest entries. The southeast entry lobby houses the grand staircase, and the southwest lobby the passenger elevators. These oval lobbies originally opened onto the public lobby and, by extension, to the postal lobby of the first floor. The current postal lobby was sealed-off via aluminum doors and the finishes have been completely altered from the original appearance. The southwest (main) entry lobby is an oval-shaped space. The rounded walls are clad with full height polished St. Genevieve Golden Vein marble. The floors are buff terrazzo with brass divider strips and a Westfield Green marble border and base. The panel ceilings are painted plaster with a painted plaster cornice ornamented with a triglyph motif. The elevators are set back in the marble and the original elevator doors are decorative bronze with cast bronze panels featuring an urn motif in the center. The decorative lintels feature egg and dart, dentil and scroll patterns with a modified keystone directly over the elevator doors. The southeast oval-shaped entry lobby contains the main staircase of the building. The finishes of this lobby {{are the same as}} the southwest with a couple of exceptions. The main staircase curves into the lobby at the north wall. The stair treads are fine sand-rubbed Appalachian Golden Vein marble; the risers, and stair and wall stringers are polished Appalachian Golden Vein marble. The public lobby is 120' long. The floors are buff terrazzo with Westfield Green marble border and base. The walls are punctuated by a series of marble engaged pilasters supporting a polychrome <b>crown</b> <b>mold</b> band with triglyphs.

The remains of the superstructure are the most extensive of any tomb at Aphrodisias. The outer walls (e-w 11. 55 m; n-s 8. 45 m) are preserved in up to four courses of large petit apareil masonry, with the largest stones in the lower courses (H: 0. 26 - 0. 32 m, W: 0. 56 - 0. 06 m, D: 0. 38 - 0. 45 m). The eastern end preserves elements of a tetrastyle façade including: euthenteria blocks (H: 0. 30 m, L: 0. 43 - 0. 70 m, D: 0. 51 m) and stylobate blocks (H: 0. 24 m), atop which are the two central pedestals (top 0. 60 m square; shaft: 0. 55 m square) with a further step (H: 0. 24 m, D: 0. 30 m) between them. Architectural blocks atop {{the eastern end of}} the tomb include a smoothly finished Attic Ionic column base (diam. : 0. 525 m) that would fit atop the pedestals, and an architrave (L: 2. 40 m) the same length as the intercolumniation between the two pedestals. In the field boundaries nearby to the southeast are further blocks that could pertain to the structure including a monumental <b>crowning</b> <b>molded</b> block, a second architrave, a doorjamb, a fluted double capital, wall blocks with dowel holes and swallow-tail clamp cuttings, and fragments of monolithic columns. The one accessible vaulted underground chamber (n-s 6. 95 m, e-w 1. 89 m) is well preserved to the south and partially collapsed to the north, and cleared to within 2. 60 m of the vault. It is the antechamber to the primary burial chamber, and was accessed by a doorway (W: 0. 76 m) through {{the south end of the}} west wall. The main tomb chamber was reached through a central doorway (W: 0. 76 m) also in the west wall (Th: 0. 80 m); both openings have flat lintels. The regularly coursed petit appareil blocks are heavily mortared, and the mortar beds are occasionally scored. The lower half of the vault appears to be built from corbelled petit appareil blocks, while the upper half is a mass of heavily mortared rubble and radially placed flat stones. Three evenly spaced windows pierce the east wall of the antechamber. The openings (H: 0. 45 - 0. 54, W: 0. 38 - 0. 43 m, D: 1. 13 m) extend from the intrados of the vault up through a slit in the center of the rising face of the stair blocks in the east façade.
