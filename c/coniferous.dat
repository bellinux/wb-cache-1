5|$|The Scots Pine and Common Juniper are {{the only}} <b>coniferous</b> trees {{definitely}} native to Scotland with Yew a possible contender.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} H.eburneus grow on the soil, mostly in <b>coniferous</b> woods, {{thickets}} and grassy areas. The fungus prefers soil that is moist, mesic, loamy and calcareous.|$|E
5|$|Typically {{found in}} <b>coniferous</b> forests, G.clavatus is mycorrhizal, and is {{associated}} with tree species {{in a variety of}} <b>coniferous</b> genera, particularly spruces and firs. It is more common at elevations of greater than , in moist, shady areas with plenty of leaf litter. Although widespread, G.clavatus has become rare in many parts of Europe and extinct in the British Isles. It has been placed on the national Red Lists of threatened fungi in 17 European countries and is one of 33 species proposed for international conservation under the Bern Convention.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. Fruit bodies {{are found in}} wet <b>coniferous</b> and deciduous forests, where they grow singly or in small groups {{on the ground in}} litterfall or humus, or in moss. Fruiting occurs in the summer and autumn.|$|E
5|$|Antrodia serialiformis {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to A.serialis, but the latter has larger spores (6.3–8 by 2.2–3.3µm). The two can be distinguished in the field by their substrate preferences: while A.serialis usually fruits on <b>coniferous</b> wood, A.serialiformis grows strictly on old decorticated oak trunks.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pinophilus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with pine (Pinus), fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea). It {{can therefore be}} located wherever those trees grow, particularly with Scots pine in Britain, preferring the poor, acidic, and sandy soils associated with <b>coniferous</b> forests. It appears to favour Pinus, while {{the form of the}} mushroom occurring in association with Abies and Picea has been labeled Boletus pinophilus var. fuscoruber. However, it is not confined to <b>coniferous</b> trees and may also be found fruiting in deciduous forests, such as under chestnut trees. Fruiting bodies can occur singly, or in small groups throughout the summer and autumn months, although they are known to appear as early as April in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Gyroporus cyanescens, {{commonly}} known as the bluing bolete or the cornflower bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Gyroporaceae. First described from France in 1788, the species is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, and eastern North America, where it grows on the ground in <b>coniferous</b> and mixed forests.|$|E
5|$|Most nests are in trees, both {{deciduous}} and <b>coniferous.</b> Sometimes, {{they can}} be found in shrubs, vines, or on artificial constructs like buildings, or hanging flower pots. When there is no suitable elevated object, mourning doves will nest on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Most nuthatches are {{woodland}} {{birds and}} the majority are found in <b>coniferous</b> or other evergreen forests, although each species has a preference for a particular tree type. The strength of the association varies from the Corsican nuthatch, which is closely linked with Corsican pine, to the catholic habitat of the Eurasian nuthatch, which prefers deciduous or mixed woods but breeds in <b>coniferous</b> forests {{in the north of}} its extensive range. However, the two species of rock nuthatches are not strongly tied to woodlands: they breed on rocky slopes or cliffs, although both move into wooded areas when not breeding. In parts of Asia where several species occur in the same geographic region, there is often an altitudinal separation in their preferred habitats.|$|E
5|$|P.squarrosa {{is found}} in North America and Europe. The North American {{distribution}} extends north to Canada, and south to Mexico, where its appearance is restricted to <b>coniferous</b> forests. In the Netherlands, P.squarrosa {{is one of many}} mushrooms that can regularly be found fruiting on ancient timber wharves.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} subarctic willow and birch forests, and open <b>coniferous</b> woodland, often close to rivers or bogs, although pairs {{are also found}} in mountains and spruce taiga. In winter, the Siberian accentor occupies bushes and shrubs, often near streams, but may {{also be found in}} dry grassland and woods.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies grows solitary, scattered, or {{clustered}} {{together on}} soil in both <b>coniferous</b> and deciduous woods, typically {{in spring and}} summer. A preference for growing in association with coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) has been noted for Californian populations.|$|E
5|$|Tylopilus alboater is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies grow on {{the ground}} solitarily, scattered, or in groups under deciduous trees, particularly oak. Fruiting occurs in deciduous, <b>coniferous,</b> and mixed forests. Its dark color {{makes it difficult to}} notice in the field.|$|E
5|$|Although more {{abundant}} in montane and northern <b>coniferous</b> woodlands {{such as the}} Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range in northwestern North America, Gyromitra esculenta is found widely across the continent, {{as far south as}} Mexico. It is also common in Central Europe, less abundant in the east, and more in montane areas than lowlands. It has been recorded from Northern Ireland, from Uşak Province in Western Turkey, and from the vicinity of Kaş in the Antalya Province of Turkey's southern coast.|$|E
5|$|Although the Rogue Valley near Medford {{is partly}} urban, the average {{population}} {{density of the}} Rogue watershed is only about 32 people per square mile (12 per km2). Several historic bridges cross the river near the more populated areas. Many public parks, hiking trails, and campgrounds are near the river, which flows largely through forests, including national forests. Biodiversity {{in many parts of}} the basin is high; the Klamath-Siskiyou temperate <b>coniferous</b> forests, which extend into the southwestern Rogue basin, are among the four most diverse of this kind in the world.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria, {{commonly}} known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete mushroom, one of many in the genus Amanita. It is also a muscimol mushroom. Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and <b>coniferous</b> trees.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ravenelii is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms mutualistic associations with shrubs and trees. Mushrooms grow {{on the ground}} solitarily, scattered, or in groups in mixed <b>coniferous</b> and deciduous forests. Although the specific tree associations preferred by A.ravenelii are unknown, in general, Amanita from section Lepidella tend to associate with diploxylon pine (that is, pines in subgenus Pinus), oak, and hickory.|$|E
5|$|Being saprobic, P. flammans {{is found}} {{exclusively}} on dead and decaying stumps and trunks of <b>coniferous</b> trees, with fruit bodies appearing in tufts or singly, from summer to autumn. It is a fungus {{with a wide}} geographical distribution in boreal and temperate regions, and may be considered common to rare depending upon the region in which it occurs. It is found throughout Europe (from the British Isles to Russia) and North America (southern Canada and the United States). The species has also been collected in Asia, including India and China.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coniferous</b> trees such {{as black}} spruce, white spruce, and balsam fir {{dominate}} the native vegetation. The largest deciduous tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, sycamore maple is most abundant and Norway maple is common. Blue spruce, common horsechestnut, European beech and littleleaf linden {{are among the}} other non-native species grown.|$|E
5|$|Cyptotrama asprata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and grows}} on the decaying wood of deciduous and <b>coniferous</b> trees. Host species include white fir (Abies concolor), sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and other maple (Acer) species, grey alder (Alnus oblongifolia), beech (Fagus) species, spruce (Picea) species, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and other pine (Pinus) species, poplar (Populus) and oak (Quercus) species. In temperate North America, specimens are typically collected between July through September.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} soft cuticles, {{termites}} do not inhabit cool or cold habitats. There are three ecological groups of termites: dampwood, drywood and subterranean. Dampwood termites are {{found only in}} <b>coniferous</b> forests, and drywood termites are found in hardwood forests; subterranean termites live in widely diverse areas. One species in the drywood group is the West Indian drywood termite (Cryptotermes brevis), which is an invasive species in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum quadrifidum, {{commonly}} known as the rayed earthstar or four-footed earthstar, is an inedible species of mushroom belonging to the genus Geastrum, or earthstar fungi. First described scientifically by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1794, G.quadrifidum is a cosmopolitan—but not common—species of Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australasia. The fungus is a saprobe, feeding off decomposing organic matter present in the soil and litter of <b>coniferous</b> forests.|$|E
5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the <b>coniferous</b> forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, {{lodgepole}} pine, {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum fungi are mycorrhizal, and {{are usually}} found in <b>coniferous</b> and mixed woods. Favored tree hosts include members of the Fagaceae and the Pinaceae. The genus is widely {{distributed}} in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly Europe and North America, but some species are also found in tropical Asia. Harrison identified a dozen new species from North America in the 1960s. Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus recognized 16 European species in his 1975 treatment of the genus, to which H. dianthifolium has been recently added by Loizides and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum peckii is an {{inedible}} (though not toxic) fungus, and {{a member}} of the genus Hydnellum of the family Bankeraceae. It is a hydnoid species, producing spores on the surface of vertical spines or tooth-like projections that hang from the undersurface of the fruit bodies. It is found in North America, Europe, and was recently discovered in Iran (2008) and Korea (2010). Hydnellum peckii is a mycorrhizal species, and forms mutually beneficial relationships with a variety of <b>coniferous</b> trees, growing on the ground singly, scattered, or in fused masses.|$|E
5|$|In North America, it {{is found}} mainly in areas east of the Mississippi River, but similar {{mushrooms}} also occur in the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, and Texas. Its range also stretches south into Mexico. They are ecologically mycorrhizal, and habitats include hardwood forests and <b>coniferous</b> forests. The mushroom grows alone, scattered, or in groups during summer and autumn. It is primarily eastern in distribution but also reported in the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, and Texas (with an apparent association with pecan trees).|$|E
5|$|Krüper's {{nuthatch}} {{is threatened}} by urbanisation and development in and around mature <b>coniferous</b> forests, particularly in the Mediterranean coastal areas where the species was once numerous. A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and {{made it easier for}} developers to build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland loss is a growing problem for the nuthatch.|$|E
5|$|Like most earthstars, G.quadrifidum is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and spends}} most of its life cycle as thin strands of mycelium, deriving nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in the soil. The fungal fruit bodies are generally found in <b>coniferous</b> woodland, where they appear in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it was found in tropical thorn forest and pine-oak forest in the summer. In Britain, all collections {{have been made in}} beech forest on calcareous soil.|$|E
5|$|Like most routes which {{pass through}} the Canadian Shield, Highway127 travels through rock cuts and muskeg-ridden terrain {{in the midst of}} dense <b>coniferous</b> forests. There is little {{agricultural}} activity along the route. Within Maynooth, Highway127 serves nearly three times as many vehicles {{as the rest of the}} route; while a daily average of 1800 vehicles use Highway127 in Maynooth, only 650 travel the length of the route. As with other provincial highways in Ontario, Highway127 is patrolled by the OPP.|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the genus Pholiota may be mistaken for Pholiota flammans, {{especially}} Pholiota squarrosa which commonly forms large tufts {{at the base of}} deciduous as well as <b>coniferous</b> trees. P.squarrosa tends to be a less intense yellow color than P.flammans. P.adiposa is also similar, but prefers to grow on dead hardwoods; unlike P.flammans, it has gelatinous scales on the stem as well as the cap.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the network}} of National Wildlife Refuges (NWR), the Tualatin River refuge {{is one of only}} ten urban refuges in the United States. Habitats in the refuge include forested areas, wetlands, oak and pine grassland, and meadows, with mixed {{deciduous}} and <b>coniferous</b> forests common to Western Oregon. The refuge was established as an urban refuge to provide wetland, riparian, and upland habitats for a variety of migratory birds, threatened and endangered species, fish and other resident wildlife. The refuge is home to nearly 200 bird species and more than 70 other animal species.|$|E
5|$|Pholiota flammans, {{commonly}} known as the yellow pholiota, the flaming Pholiota, or the flame scalecap, is a basidiomycete agaric mushroom of the genus Pholiota. Its fruit body is golden-yellow in color throughout, while its cap and stem are covered in sharp scales. As it is a saprobic fungus, the fruit bodies typically appear in clusters on the stumps of dead <b>coniferous</b> trees. P.flammans is distributed throughout Europe, North America, and Asia in boreal and temperate regions. Its edibility has not been clarified.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe pelliculosa {{is found}} in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, where it grows on the ground in groups or {{clusters}} along trails or forest roads in <b>coniferous</b> woods. A single collection has also been reported from Finland. The mushrooms contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and baeocystin, although at relatively low concentrations. Several mushroom species that are similar in appearance to P.pelliculosa can be distinguished by subtle differences {{in the form of the}} fruit body, or by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Spokane {{is within}} the Northern/Canadian Rockies ecoregion, which {{supports}} an abundance of wildlife {{in part because of}} its varied geology and natural history. The area contains a wide range of vegetation, from densely wooded <b>coniferous</b> forests to rolling grassy hills and meadows. Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir are common in the drier and lower elevation areas throughout the region. The ponderosa pine is the official tree of the City of Spokane, which is where specimens were first collected by botanist David Douglas in 1826.|$|E
5|$|Strobilurus tenacellus is a {{saprobic}} wood-rotting fungus. It fruits singly or {{in small}} groups on fallen and often partially buried cones of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), European black pine (Pinus nigra) and sometimes spruce (Picea) in <b>coniferous</b> and mixed forests. It is found in Europe and Asia, {{where it has been}} recorded in Japan and Jordan. In Europe, the fungus usually fruits from March to June. Its occurrence is occasional.|$|E
5|$|Sutorius eximius, {{commonly}} known as the lilac-brown bolete, is a species of fungus in the family Boletaceae. This bolete produces fruit bodies that are dark purple to chocolate brown in color with a smooth cap, a finely scaly stipe, and a reddish-brown spore print. The tiny pores on the cap underside are chocolate to violet brown. It is widely distributed, having been recorded on North America, South America, and Asia, where it grows in a mycorrhizal relationship with both <b>coniferous</b> and deciduous trees.|$|E
