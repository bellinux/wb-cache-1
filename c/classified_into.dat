5|$|The empire's {{population}} was <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> white people, {{also referred to}} as Europeans, and non-white people, variously referred to as persons of colour, negros and natives. The largest ethnic grouping in the empire was Indians (including what are now Pakistanis and Bangladeshis), who were <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> a number of individual South Asian ethnic groups. The following table gives the population figures for white people and non-white, in the empire and its territories, in 1814 and 1901.|$|E

5|$|Abilities are <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> {{action and}} support categories. Action {{abilities}} consume magic points (MP) and include magic spells and special moves {{that are used}} in battle. Support abilities provide functions that remain in effect indefinitely and must be equipped with magic stones to be functional. The maximum number of these stones increases as the characters level up.|$|E
5|$|Airway {{management}} can be <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> {{closed or}} open techniques {{depending on the}} system of ventilation used. Tracheal intubation is a typical example of a closed technique as ventilation occurs using a closed circuit. Several open techniques exist, such as spontaneous ventilation, apnoeic ventilation or jet ventilation. Each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages which determine when it should be used.|$|E

All but the eponymous district category are also applied to historic districts listed on the National Register.|$|E

Selective forwarding attack {{is one of}} the harmful attacks against sensor networks and can affect the whole sensor network communication. The variety of defense approaches against selective forwarding attack is overwhelming. In this paper we have described all the existing defensive schemes according to our best knowledge against this attack along with their drawbacks, thus providing researchers {{a better understanding of the}} attack and current solution space. This paper also classifies proposed schemes according to their nature and defense. Nature of scheme <b>classifies</b> <b>into</b> Distributed and Centralized.

5|$|Psoriasis is {{classified}} as a papulosquamous disorder and is most commonly subdivided into different categories based on histological characteristics. Variants include plaque, pustular, guttate, and flexural psoriasis. Each form has a dedicated ICD-10 code. Psoriasis can also be <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> nonpustular and pustular types.|$|E
5|$|Scales also {{cover the}} head, {{parts of the}} thorax and abdomen as well as parts of the genitalia. The {{morphology}} of scales has been studied by Downey & Allyn (1975) and scales have been <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> three groups, namely hair-like, or piliform, blade-like, or lamellar and other variable forms.|$|E

5|$|According {{to their}} shared {{physical}} and chemical properties, the elements can be <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys {{with one another and}} salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than the noble gases). The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature covalent bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E
5|$|All of the high-penetrating (armor-piercing) and hollow-point {{ammunition}} {{is classified}} as category A (see above). The alternative to a hollow point ammunition was Federal EFMJ, which has been <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> the arms group A in mid 2009, effectively outlawing it. Therefore, only full metal jacket or soft-nosed semi-jacketed rounds and or just unjacketed bullets (lead only) are allowed. Generally, no ammunition with higher wounding potential is allowed.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria exhibit an {{extremely}} {{wide variety of}} metabolic types. The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy, but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications. Bacterial metabolism is <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> nutritional groups {{on the basis of}} three major criteria: the kind of energy used for growth, the source of carbon, and the electron donors used for growth. An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are the electron acceptors used for aerobic or anaerobic respiration.|$|E

5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} glucocorticoid excess. It can {{be the result of}} a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E

There are rumours that {{a small number of}} Senior Prom aircraft, configured for aerial reconnaissance, were acquired by the United States Air Force, and were used in secret missions over Eastern Europe late in the Cold War, over Iraq during Operation Desert Storm, and over North Korea; there is no official confirmation of this being the case.|$|E
5|$|Frogs and toads are broadly <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which {{includes}} four families of primitive frogs; Mesobatrachia, {{which includes}} five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and Neobatrachia, {{by far the}} largest group, which contains the remaining 24 families of modern frogs, including most common species throughout the world. The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea. This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated.|$|E
