This pedagogical technique can be utilized in the case of almost any school subject, [...] " [...] is the primary pedagogical strategy in the discourse of global competencies. Educators see it as an important method for developing the tools- technical and emotional- for success in the global society". With the aim of nurturing students' potential to be both learners and citizens, the project-based approach has been used successfully in <b>community-based</b> <b>learning,</b> for example.|$|E
40|$|This paper explores learner {{progression}} {{for participants}} in <b>community-based</b> adult <b>learning</b> (CBAL) provision in Scotland. It focuses on learners' perceptions of progression drawn from analysis of life history interviews {{carried out with}} ten adults {{who had participated in}} <b>community-based</b> adult <b>learning.</b> The analysis of data was undertaken in three stages in order to construct the meaning of progression from the learners' points of view. Progression had diverse meanings for the learners in this study, and the findings show that participation in CBAL contributed to forms of economic, educational, social and personal progression by supporting learners towards their goals. Furthermore, progression was closely connected to the learners' individual circumstances. In this paper <b>community-based</b> adult <b>learning</b> is characterised as a potential 'lifeline' that supports progression and is integral to learners' lives. This view of CBAL draws attention to the need to take account of learners' life histories as we seek to identify and support progression...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{connection}} between participation in <b>community-based</b> adult <b>learning</b> (CBAL) {{and the development of}} social capital. It is based on a life-history study of participation in <b>community-based</b> adult <b>learning</b> opportunities undertaken in two local authority areas in Scotland. A life-history approach was chosen {{in order to ensure that}} the learners' perspectives were at the heart of the research while taking account of the context in which learning took place. Two semi-structured life history interviews were carried out with each of 10 learners and data were analysed in three stages, which led to the identification of cross-cutting themes. The paper explores the learners' experiences of participating in CBAL as described by them. It confirms for CBAL what has been established previously for other types of adult learning, namely that participation can support the development of social capital for some learners. Furthermore, it is argued that other learners were able to recover decreased or lost social capital through their participation. The paper contributes to an understanding of <b>community-based</b> adult <b>learning</b> as part of the continuum of lifelong learning opportunities, as it illustrates the potential of CBAL not only to support the development of social capital, but also to help learners recover capital that might have decreased through their life circumstances...|$|R
2500|$|For many {{indigenous}} students (such as Native American children), motivation may {{be derived}} from social organization; an important factor educators should account for in addition to variations in sociolinguistics and cognition. While poor academic performance among Native American students is often attributed to low levels of motivation, Top-down classroom organization is often found to be ineffective for children of many cultures who depend on a sense of community, purpose, and competence in order to engage. Horizontally structured, <b>community-based</b> <b>learning</b> strategies often provide a more structurally supportive environment for motivating indigenous children, {{who tend to be}} driven by [...] "social/affective emphasis, harmony, holistic perspectives, expressive creativity, and nonverbal communication." [...] This drive is also traceable to a cultural tradition of community-wide expectations of participation in the activities and goals of the greater group, rather than individualized aspirations of success or triumph.|$|E

Third graders wrote letters to local community leaders to acquire resources to purchase of native plants to replace invasive species on our adjacent riparian zone. The plants were chosen by third and fifth grade students, collaboratively, so that they supported the fifth grades service project of honey bee hives that ensure sources of pollination. In 2012, Seven Generations Charter School received national recognition as an EIC Model School.|$|R
