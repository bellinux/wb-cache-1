40|$|Previous {{research}} have identified that {{the performance of}} the natural draft dry cooling tower (NDDCT) is seriously influenced by the crosswind. For different size and different shape of the cooling towers, the <b>crosswind</b> <b>effects</b> are different. In order to better compare the crosswind effect on the different size of the cooling tower, this paper developed four different NDDCT models with the horizontal arranged air-cooled heat exchanger. The heights of the towers are 20 m, 60 m, 100 m and 140 m with the same aspect ratio and same aircooled heat exchanger. The cooling performance of these four cooling towers under crosswind condition were evaluated by the 3 -D CFD models and the mechanism of the crosswind effect on the cooling tower was discussed...|$|E

Single-track mode, based on a linearized vehicle and tire model, is used. Based on a given trajectory, we drove the vehicle at low and high forward speeds and on low and high road friction surfaces for a double-lane change scenario in order to follow the desired trajectory {{as close as possible}} while rejecting the effects of wind gusts. We compared the controller based on both simple and complex bicycle models without and with the roll vehicle dynamics for different types of model predictive control manoeuvres. The simulation result showed that the model predictive control gave a better performance in terms of robustness for both forward speeds and road surface variation in autonomous path-following control.

30|$|In view of {{the above}} results, the {{question}} is how can the fuel economy of vehicles be improved? Of course, the first factor is to streamline the vehicle. This has been done by all manufacturers to the point that all new automobile profiles resemble each other. Streamlining the vehicle simply reduces the drag coefficient. Thus, the value of k 2 [*]in Equations 3 and 4 are lowered as much as possible, which maximizes a and minimizes b[*]in Equation 9 accordingly. The second factor is to control the driving environment in order to expose vehicles to lower airspeeds. This is where we introduce the concept of parallel corridors. To this end, an enormous opportunity exists on heavily traveled roads to reduce fuel consumption by significant amounts without changing the vehicle or driving habits. In addition, parallel corridors could eliminate <b>crosswind</b> <b>effects</b> as well.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional {{wind load}} effects on a tall {{building}} with X-shape are investigated based on measured synchronous surface pressures in a wind tunnel. The mean and root-mean-square storey force coefficients {{in the three}} primary directions, i. e. along-wind, crosswind and torsional wind, of the building are presented. Wind-induced response analysis {{has been carried out}} in time domain by using the step-by-step numerical integration method, and the occupant comfort performance of the practical 42 -storey building is checked against the Chinese tall building design code. In the dynamic analysis, the buildings are modelled by a lumped mass system having three degrees of freedom at each floor level, i. e. two orthogonal translations and one rotation about a vertical axis. A new resultant displacement projection method is proposed to calculate the gust response factors (GRFs) along two orthogonal coordinate directions for design purpose.

40|$|In {{thermal power}} plants using variety of heat sources, the {{redundant}} heat {{needs to be}} removed through cooling devices such as heat exchangers and cooling towers. Natural draft dry cooling towers (NDDCTs) feature no water loss and no parasitic power consumption during operation and are widely used in thermal power plants around the world, especially in arid areas. The Queensland Geothermal Energy Centre of Excellence (QGECE) is focusing on developing small- or medium-scale engineered geothermal system (EGS) geothermal and concentrated solar thermal (CST) power plants for Australia. The proposed renewable power plants {{are most likely to}} be located in arid remote areas where dry cooling is the only cost-effective option. These power plants may initially be introduced to supply remote communities away from the national grid. Such off-grid applications are expected to be relatively small reflecting the size of the demand. The aim of this Thesis project is to investigate whether natural draft dry cooling towers (NDDCTs) can be used for these small- or medium-scale renewable power plants. Crosswind is the most common factor affecting the cooling performance of natural draft cooling towers. But current NDDCT design procedures do not take the <b>crosswind</b> <b>effect</b> into account.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results obtained from the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to modelling the <b>crosswind</b> <b>effect</b> on a turbulent non-premixed flame. A pre-processor software GAMBIT was employed {{to set up the}} configuration, discretisation, and boundary conditions of the flame being investigated. The commercial software Fluent 6. 3 was used to perform the calculations of flow and mixing fields as well as combustion. Standard k-ε and eddy dissipation models were selected as solvers for the representation of the turbulence and combustion, respectively. The results of all calculations are presented in the forms of contour profiles. During the investigation, the treatment was performed by setting a constant velocity of fuel at 20 m/s with varied cross-wind velocity and by keeping the cross-wind velocity constant at 1. 1 m/s with varied fuel velocity. The results of the investigation showed that the standard k-ε turbulence model in conjunction with Eddy Dissipation Model representing the combustion was capable of producing reliable phenomena of the flow field and reactive scalars field in the turbulent non-premixed flame being investigated. Other results of the investigation showed that increasing the velocity of the crosswind, when the fuel velocity was kept constant, significantly affected the flow field, temperature and species concentrations in the flare flame. On the other hand, when the velocity of the fuel was varied at the constant crosswind velocity, the increasing velocity of the fuel gave positive impact as it enabled to counteract the <b>effect</b> of <b>crosswind</b> on the flare flam...|$|R

Jet decay rate was varied through use of cylindrical centerbodies with flat or hemispherical tips submerged in the jet nozzle at various depths below the jet exit plane. Quicker jet dynamic pressure decay, caused by the presence of a centerbody, resulted in reductions in the jet induced lift loss by as much as 45 percent relative to values for jets with no centerbody. These reductions in lift loss were observed at the larger values of crossflow velocity...|$|R

40|$|Crosswind {{effect is}} a common issue which limits the cooling {{efficiency}} of natural draft dry cooling towers (NDDCTs) of all sizes. On short NDDCTs with total heights less than 30 m, this effect might be much more significant. Following the authors 2 ̆ 7 previous numerical investigation on <b>crosswind</b> <b>effects</b> in a 15 m-tall cylindrical NDDCT, an experimental study was carried out and is presented in this paper. The study used a 1 : 12. 5 scaled cooling tower model equipped with an electric resistance heater simulating horizontally placed heat exchangers. The air velocity, temperature, and the heat input on the model were measured at different crosswind speeds in a wind tunnel. Comparisons against CFD models show good agreement between the experimental and numerical results when the similarity conditions between the CFD model and the experimental model are fully satisfied. Based on these results, the total heat transfer rate of NDDCTs was proposed to {{be a combination of}} a natural convective heat transfer term and a forced convective one. In small cooling towers, the natural convection term is comparable with the forced convection term. This explains why the correlation of the total heat transfer with the wind speed has a turnabout point below which the heat transfer decreases with increasing crosswind speed and above which it does the reverse. The turnabout point occurs when the sum of natural and forced convection terms is the minimum...|$|E
40|$|The {{safety of}} road {{vehicles}} {{on the ground in}} crosswind has been investigated for many years. One of the most important fundamentals in the safety analysis is aerodynamic characteristics of a vehicle in crosswind. The most common way to study the aerodynamic characteristics of a vehicle in crosswind is wind tunnel tests to measure the aerodynamic coefficients and/or pressure coefficients of the vehicle. Due to the complexity of wind tunnel test equipment and procedure, the features of flow field around the vehicle are seldom explored in a wind tunnel, particularly for the vehicle moving on the ground. As a complementary to wind tunnel tests, the numerical method using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be employed as an effective tool to explore the aerodynamic characteristics of as well as flow features around the vehicle. This study explores <b>crosswind</b> <b>effects</b> on a high-sided lorry on the ground with and without movement through CFD simulations together with wind tunnel tests. Firstly, the aerodynamic forces on a stationary lorry model are measured in a wind tunnel, and the results are compared with the previous measurement results. The CFD with unsteady RANS method is then employed to simulate wind flow around and wind pressures on the stationary lorry. The numerical aerodynamic forces are compared with the wind tunnel test results. Furthermore, the same CFD method is extended to investigate the moving vehicle on the ground in crosswind. The results show that the CFD results match with wind tunnel test results and the current way using aerodynamic coefficients from a stationary vehicle in crosswind is acceptable. The CFD simulation can provide more insights on flow field and pressure distribution which are difficult to be obtained by wind tunnel tests. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) has developed since its conception many years ago. UAVs have several features such as, computerised and autonomous control {{without the need}} for an on-board pilot. Therefore, there is no risk of loss of life and they are easier to maintain than manned aircraft. In addition, UAVs have an extended range/endurance capability, sometimes for several days. This makes UAVs attractive for missions that are typically "dull, dirty and dangerous". With the development of technology, the application of UAVs is becoming commonplace for both military and civil missions. Examples of this are reconnaissance, surveillance, environmental monitoring, disaster observation, etc. The School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering (SAMME) at RMIT University has designed a novel concept for a ducted-fan UAV with vertical takeoff and landing capability and the option to transition to horizontal flight. The aerodynamic analysis, preliminary and detailed design, of this ducted-fan VTOL UAV, is the first and most important step. To optimize the aerodynamic characteristics, evaluating aerodynamic coefficients and analyzing the flow patterns around the vehicle at different speeds and angles of attack is necessary. In this project, CFD {{plays an important role in}} predicting the longitudinal and lateral stability and control characteristics of a full-scale model of ducted fan VTOL UAV at both vertical and horizontal flight without any prior knowledge of existing wind tunnel or flight test data. Prior to carrying out experiments in the wind tunnel, the manufacture of ducted fan VTOL UAV was focused on. Particular attention was paid to the propulsion system as the key point. The full-scale model of UAV was produced using the Rapid Prototyping Facility at SAMME to ensure its accurate geometric shape for testing in the wind tunnel. The experiments of the full-scale UAV model with engines was conducted in RMIT&# 039;s Industrial Wind Tunnel where its aerodynamic characteristics and its properties of counter-rotating propulsion system were tested. In addition, the correlation between experimental data and CFD results was evaluated and the accuracy of the dynamic model of ducted fan VTOL UAV was improved. Flight dynamics is concerned with the motion of an aircraft due to internally or externally generated forces. The ducted fan VTOL UAV stability and control derivatives are determined and used as a basis in a flight simulation environment. This simulation showed that the vehicle is stable and controllable for a range of flight speeds. Finally, a MIMO linear control system was designed to control the vehicle in hovering and low-speed slide flight. The real-time simulation and modeling in MATLAB combined with a flight-simulator showed several animations and trajectories of UAV missions with or without <b>crosswind</b> <b>effect</b> during flight. These simulations were very helpful in determining the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle under various flight conditions...|$|R

The effects of cyclonic wind and provision of outriggers on 28 storey, 42 -storey and 57 -storey are examined in this paper and certain conclusions are made which would pave way for researchers to conduct further study in this particular area of civil engineering. The results show that plan dimensions have vital impacts on structural heights. Increase of height while keeping the plan dimensions same, leads to the reduction in the lateral rigidity.

S. Army OH- 58 A and the OH- 58 D helicopters. The effects of longitudinal strakes attached to the cross sections were studied. To obtain the aerodynamic forces acting on the cross sections, the flow incidence range on the scaled models was varied from - 45 to 90 degrees and the models were tested through a dynamic pressure range of 5 to 15 psf. The results of the OH- 58 A and the OH- 58 D configurations show a significant improvement at conditions which represent right sideward flight by reducing the adverse aerodynamic side force when the strakes are installed. These data were used to calculate a change in tail rotor power for the full scale flight vehicle and indicated approx. a 5 to 6 percent average savings in right sideward flight for the critical velocity range of 0 to 30 knots. Increases in the tail boom normal force were noted due to the strakes. The results indicate a potential for reducing the directional control and tail rotor thrust required in the critical hover and right sideward flight speed range with a calculated minimum increase to main rotor power required and an overall net improvement in power of 0. 5 percent for both the OH- 58 A and OH- 58 D...|$|R

Crosswind kite power was brought again into focus when Miles L. Loyd carefully described the mathematics and potential of crosswind kite power in 1980. In 1980 {{it was not}} possible to create an economical automatic control system to control the wings of a kite system, though passive control of crosswinding kite systems had been ancient. With the advance of computational and sensory resources fine control of the wings of a kite system became not only affordable, but cheap.

Synthetic materials suitable for the wing and tether became affordable; among those materials are UHMWPE, carbon fiber, PETE, and rip-stop nylon. A large number of people became engaged in the sports of kitesurfing, kiteboarding, kite buggying, snowkiting, and power kiting. Multiple companies and academic teams work on crosswind kite power.

40|$|The use of {{high-performance}} {{materials in}} bridges {{is leading to}} structures that {{are more susceptible to}} wind- and traffic-induced vibrations due to the reduction in the weight and the increment of the slenderness in the deck. Bridges can experience considerable vibration due to both moving vehicles and wind actions that affect the comfort of the bridge users and the driving safety. This work explored the driving safety and comfort in a very slender arch bridge under turbulent wind and vehicle actions, as well as the comfort of pedestrians. A fully coupled wind–vehicle–bridge interaction model based on the direct integration of the system of dynamics was developed. In this model, the turbulent crosswind is represented by means of aerodynamic forces acting on the vehicle and the bridge. The vehicle is modeled as a multibody system that interacts with the bridge by means of moving contacts that also simulate road-surface irregularities. A user element is presented with generality and implemented using a general-purpose finite-element software package to incorporate the aeroelastic components of the wind forces, which allows modeling and solving of the wind–vehicle–bridge interaction in the time domain without the need for using the modal superposition technique. An extensive computational analysis program is performed {{on the basis of a}} wide range of turbulent crosswind speeds. The results show that bridge vibration is significantly affected by the crosswind in terms of peak acceleration and frequency content when the crosswind intensity is significant.
