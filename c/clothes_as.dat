He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, {{oversized}} shirts, and long scarves. He also borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels that he wore on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{historically}} contentious views within Jainism {{is in part}} attributed to Mahavira and his ascetic life where he never wore any <b>clothes</b> <b>as</b> a mark of disowning everything (interpreted {{as a consequence of}} the fifth vow of Aparigraha). The disputes triggered by this teaching of Mahavira are those related to gender and whether a female mendicant (sadhvi) can achieve spiritual liberation just like a male mendicant (sadhu) through Jain ascetic practices.|$|E

5|$|Gibson {{had been}} one of 28 people aboard the first {{lifeboat}} to be launched from Titanic and was rescued about five and a half hours after leaving the ship. On returning to New York City, she co-wrote the script and played a fictionalized version of herself. The plot involves her recounting the story of the disaster to her fictional parents and fiancé, with the footage interspersed with stock footage of icebergs, Titanics sister ship Olympic and the ship's captain, Edward Smith. To add to the film's authenticity, Gibson wore the same <b>clothes</b> <b>as</b> {{on the night of the}} disaster. The filming took place in a New Jersey studio and aboard a derelict ship in New York Harbor.|$|E

5|$|At {{the village}} of Kusić in Banat, a man named Ilija Bordan was {{regarded}} to be alovit; the villagers talked {{that he had a}} tail. Whenever a thunderstorm came, his appearance changed—he fought with an ala. If the ala was overwhelming him, Ilija would lie down and sleep, and if he was overpowering her, the clouds would start to dissipate. There was a tale in the same village about an alovit man who would warn the villagers of the approach of a thunderstorm, before he took a wagon pole on his back and flew into the clouds. At {{the village of}} Sokolovac in Banat, people told of an alovit man who had four nipples. At the sight of hail clouds, he would mount his mare and disappear for several days. The latter two men would come back tired, bruised, and with torn <b>clothes.</b> <b>As</b> held in the central Serbian region of Gruža, men could become dragonlike. As such, they would suddenly disappear during thunderstorms, and fly into the dark clouds to fight against ale. They were characterized as nimble, hot-tempered, rash and very strong. At a village near Radomir in western Bulgaria, there was a dragon man who was said to have been physically crippled by an ala.|$|E
5|$|The Roman heavy cavalry now {{charged the}} German horsemen. In the ensuing mêlée, Chnodomar's stratagem paid dividends. The {{interspersed}} foot warriors wreaked havoc, {{bringing down the}} horses of the cataphracts and then killing their riders on the ground. Unnerved by these tactics, and by the injury {{of one of their}} tribuni, the cataphracts panicked and fled the field. In their headlong flight, they crashed into the Roman infantry on the right, which, however, was able to maintain formation because of the skill of the crack auxilia palatina regiments Cornuti and Brachiati posted there. The cataphracts took refuge behind the infantry lines, where it took the personal intervention of Julian himself to rally them. Zosimus claims that one regiment of cataphracts refused to return to the fight and that after the battle, they were obliged by Julian to wear female <b>clothes</b> <b>as</b> punishment. The performance {{of the rest of the}} cavalry is not described by Ammianus, but they would have been obliged to retreat with the cataphracts, though it is unclear whether they followed them to behind the infantry lines, or, more likely, halted to cover the Roman right wing. It is clear, however, that the German cavalry was unable to capitalise on their success to outflank the Roman right. Nevertheless, Chnodomar had trumped Julian's best card.|$|E

25|$|The word Digambara is a {{combination}} of two Sanskrit words: dik (दिक्) (directions) and ambara (अम्बर) (clothes), referring to those whose garments are of the element that fills the four quarters of space. Digambara monks do not wear any <b>clothes</b> <b>as</b> it is considered to be parigraha (possession), which ultimately leads to attachment. A Digambara monk has 28 mūla guņas (primary attributes). These are: five mahāvratas (supreme vows); five samitis (regulations); pañcendriya nirodha (five-fold control of the senses); Ṣadāvaśyakas (six essential duties); and seven niyamas (rules or restrictions).|$|E

25|$|It {{is also at}} {{this time}} when the concept of fashion, {{as it is known}} today, begins. Prior to this point, <b>clothes</b> <b>as</b> a means of {{self-expression}} were limited. Guild-controlled systems of production and distribution, and the sumptuary laws made clothing both hard to come by and expensive for the common people. However, by 1750 the consumer revolution brought about cheaper copies of fashionable styles, allowing members of all classes to partake in fashionable dress. Thus, fashion begins to represent an expression of individuality. The constant change in dress mirrored political and social ideals of the time.|$|E
25|$|Upon arrival, the Malay datus met the Ati {{chieftain}} Datu Marikudo and {{his wife}} Maniwantiwan.

Datu Marikudo responded to the datus' generosity by giving the Malayans the lowlands and moving to the mountains with his Ati tribe as the mountains are sacred to them. The legacy of this landing is commemorated annually in Antique during the Binirayan festival.|$|E

Another feature is {{the ability to}} install an entire game disc onto the Xbox 360's hard drive, which decreases loading times, and significantly reduces noise due to the game being read from the hard drive and not the louder disc drive (similar to the PS2 HD LOADER Feature). For most games this feature also reduces {{the amount of time spent}} reading the disc, thereby helping to extend the life-span of the optical drive mechanism.|$|E

5000|$|Fitting rooms, or [...] "dressing rooms", are {{rooms where}} people try on <b>clothes,</b> such <b>as</b> in a {{department}} store. The rooms are usually individual rooms {{in which a person}} tries on clothes to determine fit before making a purchase. People do not always use the fitting rooms to change, as to change implies to remove one set of clothes and put on another. Sometimes a person chooses to try on clothes over their <b>clothes</b> (such <b>as</b> sweaters or coats), but would still like to do this in private. Thus fitting rooms may be used for changing, or just for fitting without changing.|$|R
