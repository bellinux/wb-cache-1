50|$|A common {{example is}} {{switching}} from a manual transmission vehicle to an automatic transmission vehicle. The adaptive response series {{in a standard}} vehicle when it reaches 10 miles per hour is {{to step on the}} <b>clutch,</b> <b>shift</b> gears, and step on the accelerator. This previously adaptive response is incompatible with the proper response in an automatic transmission, confirming how prior experience can limit the ability to function efficiently in new settings.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tachometer}} (tach) {{shows how}} fast that the player's engine is turning over. A dark green line that {{starts at the}} left side of his television screen for each can and turns red at about the middle is his tach. When it turns red, the player is in the high power - but danger!- area. The player will find that he get his best speed in each gear by red-lining his tach close to the maximum [...] But watch out! If the player revs his engine too much, it will blow. So be careful. Once the player blows his engine, the race is over for him [...] The way to build maximum speed is to quickly <b>clutch</b> <b>shift</b> and accelerate through all four gears with maximum power at each gear level.|$|E
50|$|In both types, a {{particular}} gear combination {{can only be}} engaged when the two parts to engage (either gears or clutches) are at the same speed. To shift to a higher gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the engine allowed to slow down until the transmission parts for the next gear are at a proper speed to engage. The vehicle also slows while in neutral and that slows other transmission parts, so the time in neutral depends on the grade, wind, and other such factors. To shift to a lower gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the throttle is used {{to speed up the}} engine and thus the relevant transmission parts, to match speeds for engaging the next lower gear. For both upshifts and downshifts, the clutch is released (engaged) while in neutral. Some drivers use the clutch only for starting from a stop, and shifts are done without the clutch. Other drivers will depress (disengage) the <b>clutch,</b> <b>shift</b> to neutral, then engage the clutch momentarily to force transmission parts to match the engine speed, then depress the clutch again to shift to the next gear, a process called double clutching. Double clutching is easier to get smooth, as speeds that are close but not quite matched need to speed up or slow down only transmission parts, whereas with the clutch engaged to the engine, mismatched speeds are fighting the rotational inertia and power of the engine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Clutch {{shift control}} is {{critical}} for the performance and fuel economy of automotive transmission, including both automatic and hybrid transmissions. Among all {{the factors that influence}} <b>clutch</b> <b>shift</b> control, clutch fill and clutch engagement are crucial to realize a fast and smooth <b>clutch</b> <b>shift.</b> When the clutch is not engaged, the fluid held by the centrifugal force inside of the clutch chamber, which introduces additional pressure that will affect the subsequent clutch fill and engagement processes, should be released. To realize this function, a ball capsule system is introduced and mounted on the clutch chamber. When the clutch is ready to be filled for engagement, the ball capsule needs to close quickly and remain closed until the clutch is disengaged. It’s also desirable to have appropriate closing velocity for the ball capsule to minimize noise and wear. In this paper, we will model the ball capsule dynamics and reveal its intrinsic positive feedback structure, which is considered to be the key to realize a fast response, and design the optimal shape of the capsule to achieve the desired performance.

Aiming at {{the problem}} of long time power interruption and clutch master-slave friction plates wore seriously which greatly shorten the life of clutch during shifting process of AMT, a overrunning AMT without separation process of clutch when shifting is designed. This paper has analyzed structural characteristics and shift principle of overrunning AMT. Through force analysis on the jointing process of roller overrunning clutch, the mathematical model and dynamic model of transmission system are established.

40|$|Clutch fill {{control in}} clutch-to-clutch {{transmissions}} influences shift quality considerably. An oncoming clutch {{should be applied}} synchronously {{with the release of}} an offgoing clutch to shift gear smoothly; therefore, the gap between the piston and clutch plates should be eliminated when the torque capacity is near zero {{at the end of the}} clutch fill phase. Open-loop control is typically implemented for the clutch fill because of the cost of pressure sensor. Low control precision causes underfill or overfill to occur, deteriorating shift quality. In this paper, a mathematical model of an electrohydraulic <b>clutch</b> <b>shift</b> control system is presented. Special dynamic characteristic parameters for optimal clutch fill control are subsequently proposed. An automatic method for predicting initial fill control parameters is proposed to eliminate distinct discrepancies among transmissions caused by manufacturing or assembling errors. To prevent underfill and overfill, a fuzzy adaptive control method is proposed, in which clutch fill control parameters are adjusted self-adaptively and continually. Road vehicle test results proved that applying the fuzzy adaptive method ensures the consistency of shift quality even after the transmission’s status is changed...|$|E

40|$|Large civil tiltrotors {{have been}} {{identified}} to replace regional airliners over medium ranges to alleviate next-generation air traffic. Variable rotor speed for these vehicles is required for efficient high-speed operation. Two-speed drive system research has been performed to support these advanced rotorcraft applications. Experimental tests were performed on two promising two-speed transmission configurations. The offset compound gear (OCG) transmission and the dual star/idler (DSI) planetary transmission were tested in the NASA Glenn Research Center variable-speed transmission test facility. Both configurations were inline devices with concentric {{input and output shafts}} and designed to provide 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 output speed reduction ratios. Both were designed for 200 hp and 15, 000 rpm input speed and had a dry <b>shift</b> <b>clutch</b> configuration. <b>Shift</b> tests were performed on the transmissions at input speeds of 5, 000, 8, 000, 10, 000, 12, 500, and 15, 000 rpm. Both the OCG and DSI configurations successfully perform speed shifts at full rated 15, 000 rpm input speed. The transient shifting behavior of the OCG and DSI configurations were very similar. The <b>shift</b> <b>clutch</b> had more of an effect on shifting dynamics than the reduction gearing configuration itself since the same <b>shift</b> <b>clutch</b> was used in both configurations. For both OCG and DSI configurations, low-to-high speed shifts were limited in applied torque levels in order to prevent overloads on the transmission due to transient torque spikes. It is believed that the relative lack of appreciable slippage of the dry <b>shifting</b> <b>clutch</b> at operating conditions and pressure profiles tested was a major cause of the transient torque spikes. For the low-to-high speed shifts, the output speed ramp-up time slightly decreased and the peak out torque slightly increased as the clutch pressure ramp-down rate increased. This was caused by slightly less clutch slippage as the clutch pressure ramp-down rate increased...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the control {{strategy}} of shifting time involving multigroup clutches for a hydromechanical continuously variable transmission (HMCVT). The dynamic analyses of mathematical models are presented in this paper, and the simulation models are used to study the control strategy of HMCVT.

On this basis, simulation analysis and test verification of two typical conditions, which play the decisive roles for the shifting quality, are carried out. The results show that {{there are differences in}} the shifting time of the two typical conditions. In the shifting process from the negative transmission of hydromechanical ranges to the positive transmission of hydromechanical ranges, the control strategy based on the shifting time is switching the <b>clutches</b> of <b>shifting</b> mechanism firstly and then disengaging a group of clutches of planetary gear mechanism and engaging another group of the clutches of planetary gear mechanism lastly.

5000|$|In 1991 some {{drivers in}} NASCAR (notably Mark Martin) experimented with {{shifting}} gears down the mammoth 3,740 foot long frontstretch.
