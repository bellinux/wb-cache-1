40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of a new passive wireless pressure sensor, based on an electromagnetic transduction approach, is reported. The sensing element is a flexible high resistivity silicon membrane located above a coplanar quarter-wavelength resonator. The comprehensive coverage of the physical bases {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper. For the remote extraction of the applied pressure value, the passive pressure sensor is connected to a broadband horn antenna via a coaxial delay line. When interrogated by a frequency modulated continuous wave radar, the level of the backscattered signal changes versus the pressure applied to the proof body. Through this interrogation principle, the sensor provides load impedance that is reflected back to the radar reader: the measured dynamic is about 0. 8 dBm/bar.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of object-directed reaching {{in a population}} of artificial-life organisms was investigated. The capacity to discriminate between two objects emerged as organisms evolved the ability to reach. Discrimination of proximal sensory signals (i. e., by touch) evolved before discrimination of distal signals (i. e., by sight). However, organisms with the capacity to discriminate by sight were ultimately the most successful at selecting and reaching for an object which increased fitness. Organisms with both proximal and distal sensory systems evolved at an intermediate rate, due to the added computational task of integrating tactile and visual discrimination. In addition, the rate of visual discrimination evolution was modestly accelerated by providing a non-differential <b>contact</b> <b>signal.</b> 1. Introduction.

40|$|During the {{initiation}} of an antigen-specific immune response, peptide fragments originating from the antigen are presented in complex with MHC class II glycoproteins (MHCgpII) {{on the surface of}} the antigen presenting cells (APC). Antigen recognition by T lymphocyte is accompanied by the formation of the molecular structure at the interface with APC called immunological synapse (IS). During this <b>contact,</b> <b>signal</b> transduction is initiated at both, T lymphocyte and APC, sides of the IS. For a long time it was thought that the only function of MHCgpII is presentation of antigen. However, later it was found that stimulation of MHCgpII led to triggering of signals contributing to decision about the further fate of APC. MHCgpII do not have any signaling motifs in their cytoplasmatic domains, and so associated molecules are necessary for the transduction of the signals. This work focuses on B lymphocytes in which the associated molecules are Ig alfa/beta, MPYS, CD 19 and CD 20. After the stimulation of MHCgpII these proteins mediate signaling events including activation of several families of protein kinases, phospholipase C, mobilization of calcium and activation of transcriptional factors NFAT and AP- 1.

40|$|An {{oriented}} cluster perforating technology, which integrates both {{advantages of}} cluster and oriented perforating, will help solve {{a series of}} technical complexities in horizontal well drilling. For realizing its better application in oil and gas development, a series of technologies were developed including perforator self-weight eccentricity, matching of the electronic selective module codes with the surface program control, axial centralized <b>contact</b> <b>signal</b> transmission, and post-perforation intercluster sealing insulation. In this way, the following functions could be realized, such as cable-transmission horizontal well perforator self-weight orientation, dynamic signal transmission, reliable addressing & selective perforation and post-perforation intercluster sealing. The combined perforation and bridge plug or the multi-cluster perforation can be fulfilled in one trip of perforation string. As a result, the horizontal-well oriented cluster perforating technology based on cable conveying was developed. This technology was successfully applied in unconventional gas reservoir exploitation, such as shale gas and coalbed methane, with accurate orientation, reliable selective perforation and satisfactory inter-cluster sealing. The horizontal-well oriented cluster perforating technology benefits the orientation of horizontal well drilling with a definite target and direction, which provides a powerful support for the subsequent reservoir stimulation. It also promotes the fracturing fluid to sweep the principal pay zones to the maximum extent. Moreover, it is conductive {{to the formation of}} complex fracture networks in the reservoirs, making quality and efficient development of unconventional gas reservoirs possible...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} and functional link between adhesion molecules and the cytoskeletal network {{suggests that the}} cytoskeleton might mediate the transduction of cell-to-cell <b>contact</b> <b>signals,</b> which often regulate growth and differentiation in an antagonistic manner. Depolymerization of the cytoskeleton in confluent cell cultures is reportedly sufficient to initiate DNA synthesis. Here we show that depolymerization of the cytoskeleton is also sufficient to repress differentiation-specific gene expression. Glutamine synthetase is a glia-specific differentiation marker gene whose expression in the retinal tissue is regulated by glucocorticoids and is ultimately dependent on glia-neuron cell contacts. Depolymerization of the actin or microtubule network in cells of the intact retina mimics the effects of cell separation, repressing glutamine synthetase induction by a mechanism that involves induction of c-Jun and inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activity. Depolymerization of the cytoskeleton activates JNK and p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and induces c-Jun expression by a signaling pathway that depends on tyrosine kinase activity. Induction of c-Jun expression is restricted to Müller glial cells, the only cells in the tissue that express glutamine synthetase and maintain the ability to proliferate upon cell separation.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMCs) for high resolution spectroscopy. MMCs are energy dispersive particle detectors based on the calorimetric principle which are typically operated at temperatures below 100 mK. The detectors make use of a paramagnetic temperature sensor to transform the temperature rise upon the {{absorption of a particle}} in the detector into a measurable magnetic flux change in a dc-SQUID. The application of MMCs for neutrino mass measurements and their advantages with respect to other approaches are discussed. In view of this application the development of an MMC optimized for β-endpoint spectroscopy on 187 -rhenium is presented. A fully micro-fabricated X-ray detector is characterized and performs close to design values. Furthermore, a new technique to more efficiently couple rhenium absorbers mechanically and thermally to the sensor was developed and successfully tested. By employing a metallic <b>contact,</b> <b>signal</b> rise times faster than 5 μs could be observed with superconducting rhenium absorbers. In addition to the single pixel detectors, an alternative approach of reading out multiple pixels was developed in this work, too. Here, the individual absorbers have a different thermal coupling to only one temperature sensor resulting in a distribution of different pulse shapes. Straightforward position discrimination by means of rise time analysis is demonstrated for a four pixel MMC and a thermal model of the detector is provided. Unprecedented so far, an energy resolution of less than ∆E_FWHM < 5 eV for 5. 9 keV X-rays was achieved across all absorbers...|$|E
40|$|An exact {{description}} is provided of an almost spherical fluid vesicle with a fixed {{area and a}} fixed enclosed volume locally deformed by external normal forces bringing two nearby points on the surface together symmetrically. The conformal invariance of the two-dimensional bending energy is used to identify the distribution of energy {{as well as the}} stress established in the vesicle. While these states are local minima of the energy, this energy is degenerate; there is a zero mode in the energy fluctuation spectrum, associated with area and volume preserving conformal transformations, which breaks the symmetry between the two points. The volume constraint fixes the distance $S$, measured along the surface, between the two points; if it is relaxed, a second zero mode appears, reflecting the independence of the energy on $S$; in the absence of this constraint a pathway opens for the membrane to slip out of the defect. Logarithmic curvature singularities in the surface geometry at the points of <b>contact</b> <b>signal</b> the presence of external forces. The magnitude of these forces varies inversely with $S$ and so diverges as the points merge; the corresponding torques vanish in these defects. The geometry behaves near each of the singularities as a biharmonic monopole, in the region between them as a surface of constant mean curvature, and in distant regions as a biharmonic quadrupole. Comparison of the distribution of stress with the quadratic approximation in the height functions points to shortcomings of the latter representation. Radial tension is accompanied by lateral compression, both near the singularities and far away, with a crossover from tension to compression occurring in the region between them.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of HPGe detectors clearly indicates {{a trend toward}} segmented structures which are suitable for gamma-ray tracking and gamma-imaging techniques to be applied. Therefore, the effects related to these structures – cross-talk and charge sharing are of paramount importance for the detector spectroscopic properties. The charge-sharing effect has been studied mainly in the silicon detectors where it dominates sometimes over the other charge collection processes and only few studies report on HPGe detectors although {{this is an excellent}} case due to low impurity concentration, homogeneous electric field and the large sizes of the structures [1], [2]. The charge sharing effect competes with the induced charge effect and Compton scattering in segmented germanium detectors. The interplay of these effects may lead to wrong position determination of the interaction. In order to estimate the scale of the phenomenon an experimental study of the charge sharing effect on HPGe planar single-side-strip detector is carried out. The detector has a square crystal with sizes of 32 x 32 mm and thickness of 12. 5 mm. The front (segmented) side is contacted by Boron implantation and the non-segmented rear side is contacted by Li-diffusion. Accounting the 3. 5 mm guard ring and the diffusion thickness, the effective size of the crystal becomes 25 x 25 x 12 mm. The front side is segmented onto 7 strips with a width of 3. 57 mm. This side is scanned by a collimated 241 Am source along the axis transversal to the length of the strips and parallel to the front face with a step of 0. 5 mm.
