5|$|The D± signals used by low, full, {{and high}} speed are carried over a twisted pair (typically, unshielded) to reduce noise and <b>crosstalk.</b> SuperSpeed uses {{separate}} transmit and receive differential pairs, which additionally require shielding (typically, {{shielded twisted pair}} but twinax is also mentioned by the specification). Thus, to support SuperSpeed data transmission, cables contain twice as many wires and are thus larger in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The {{expression}} of genes {{is influenced by}} how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, <b>crosstalk</b> between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been {{dramatic}} changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of TAT-8 in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid {{at that time and}} today's optic fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8. This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, optic fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from <b>crosstalk</b> which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable. Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.|$|E

5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent <b>crosstalk.</b> At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{technical}} {{reason for this}} difficulty is that the frequency response of a simple filter approaches a fall of 6 dB/octave far {{from the point of}} resonance. This means that if telephone channels are squeezed in side-by-side into the frequency spectrum, there will be <b>crosstalk</b> from adjacent channels in any given channel. What is required is a much more sophisticated filter that has a flat frequency response in the required passband like a low-Q resonant circuit, but that rapidly falls in response (much faster than 6dB/octave) at the transition from passband to stopband like a high-Q resonant circuit. Obviously, these are contradictory requirements to be met with a single resonant circuit. The solution to these needs was founded in the theory of transmission lines and consequently the necessary filters did not become available until this theory was fully developed. At this early stage the idea of signal bandwidth, and hence the need for filters to match to it, was not fully understood; indeed, it was as late as 1920 before the concept of bandwidth was fully established. For early radio, the concepts of Q-factor, selectivity and tuning sufficed. This was all to change with the developing theory of transmission lines on which image filters are based, as explained in the next section.|$|E

40|$|Length-matching is an {{important}} technique to balance delays of bus signals in high-performance PCB routing. Existing routers, however, may generate dense meander segments with small distance. Signals propagating across these meander segments exhibit a speedup effect due to <b>crosstalks</b> between the segments of the same wire, thus leading to mismatch of arrival times even with the same physical wire length. In this paper, we propose a post-processing method to enlarge the width and the distance of meander segments and distribute them more evenly on the board so that the <b>crosstalks</b> can be reduced. In the proposed framework, we model the sharing combinations of available routing areas after removing dense meander segments from the initial routing, {{as well as the}} generation of relaxed meander segments and their groups in subareas. Thereafter, this model is transformed into an ILP problem and solved efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed method can extend the width and the distance of meander segments about two times even under very tight area constraints, so that the <b>crosstalks</b> and thus the speedup effect can be alleviated effectively in high-performance PCB designs.

40|$|Serine {{threonine}} protein kinases (STPK) play a {{major role}} in the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here, we examined the role of STPK pknE, using a deletion mutant DpknE in the modulation of intracellular signaling events that favor M. tuberculosis survival. Phosphorylation kinetics of MAPK (p 38 MAPK, ErkK and SAPK/JNK) was defective in DpknE compared to wild-type infected macrophages. This defective signaling dramatically delayed and reduced the phosphorylation kinetics of transcription factors ATF- 2 and c-JUN in DpknE infected macrophages. MAPK inhibitors instead of reducing the phosphorylation in DpknE infected macrophages, revealed <b>crosstalks</b> with ErkK signaling influenced by SAPK/JNK and p 38 pathways independently. Modulations in intra cellular signaling altered the expression of coreceptors CCR 5 and CXCR 4 in DpknE infected macrophages. In conclusion, pknE plays a role in MAPK <b>crosstalks</b> that enables intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis. This survival strategy also impacts HIV/TB coinfection...|$|R
