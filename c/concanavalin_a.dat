5|$|A {{circular}} permutation is {{a relationship}} between proteins whereby the proteins have a changed order of amino acids in their peptide sequence. The result is a protein structure with different connectivity, but overall similar three-dimensional (3D) shape. In 1979, the first pair of circularly permuted proteins – <b>concanavalin</b> <b>A</b> and lectin – were discovered; over 2000 such proteins are now known.|$|E

5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media {{was talking about a}} second line transformed with <b>concanavalin</b> <b>A</b> (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E

The data establish that (i) microtubule disassembly is correlated with enhanced Con A cap formation on normal human lymphocytes; (ii) T and B cells differ significantly from each other and from circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes with respect to their capping responses after exposure to colchicine; and (iii) there is an abnormal relationship of microtubule assembly to surface topography in the functionally defective SCID cells...|$|R

Using this polyclonal system, HD patients' spleen T-lymphocytes could not be shown to differ markedly from the control series.

In this respect HD and control spleen resembled peripheral blood.

40|$|During {{the acute}} phase {{response}} (APR) to tissue injury or infection, the liver {{is responsible for}} the level of mediators such as cytokines required at the site of inflammation and providing the essential components for wound healing and tissue repair. Additionally there are substantial alterations in the expression of plasma proteins of hepatic origin such as alpha- 1 -acid glycoprotein (AGP). The APR also results in alterations to the branching, sialylation and fucosylation of the oligosaccharide chains of AGP. This study investigated whether liver damage could be correlated with changes in AGP glycosylation in groups of patients with various liver diseases (alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cirrhosis). Hyperfucosylation occurred in all cases of liver disease, although the hepatitis B and C samples showed a more significant increase in comparison with the others. Additionally N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) was detected in the majority of the hepatitis C samples, which was unexpected since this monosaccharide is not a usual component of the N-linked oligosaccharide chains.

Using donor cells, whose DNA had been substituted with bromodeoxyuridine (BUdr) in sufficient amounts to increase its buoyant density, it was concluded that redistribution of label rather than cell division was responsible for this increase of labelled nuclei.

The procedure was also used to purify enzyme from kidney and placenta. The subunit Mr of liver, kidney and placenta sulphamate sulphohydrolase was assessed to be 56, 000 by using SDS/polacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The native protein Mr of enzyme from all three tissue sources was assessed by gel-permeation chromatography to be approx. 120, 000 on Sephacryl S- 300 and 100, 000 on Fractogel TSK. It is probable that the native enzyme results from dimerization of subunits. Kinetic parameters (km and kcat.) of human liver sulphamate sulphohydrolase were determined {{with a variety of}} substrates matching structural aspects of the physiological substrates in vivo, namely heparin and heparan sulphate. More structurally complex substrates, in which several aspects of the aglycone structure of the natural substrate were maintained, are turned over up to 372000 times faster than the monosaccharide substrate 2 -sulphaminoglucosamine. Aglycone structures that influence substrate binding and/or enzyme activity were penultimate-residue C- 6 carboxy and C- 2 sulphate ester groups and a post-penultimate 2 -sulphaminoglucosamine residue. The C- 4 hydroxy group of the 2 -sulphaminoglucosamine under enzymic attack is involved in binding of substrate to enzyme. The presence of C- 6 sulphate ester on the non-reducing end 2 -sulphaminoglucosamine stimulates sulphamate bond hydrolysis and substrate affinity if the adjacent monosaccharide residue is idose or 2 -sulphoidose, but strongly inhibits hydrolysis if the adjacent monosaccharide residue is iduronic acid. Sulphamate sulphohydrolase is an exoenzyme, since activity toward internal sulphamate bonds was not detected. The effect of incubation pH on enzyme activity towards the variety of substrates evaluated was complex and dependent on substrate aglycone structure. The presence of aglycone C- 2 sulphate ester and aglycone C- 6 carboxy groups and C- 6 sulphate ester groups on the 2 -sulphaminoglucosamine residue under attack considerably affect the pH response. Structurally complex substrates had two pH optima. Incubation temperature and buffer ionic strength markedly influenced pH optima and enzyme activity.
