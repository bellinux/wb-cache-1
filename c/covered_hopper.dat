25|$|For {{the first}} ten years of production, Ensign {{manufactured}} iron parts such as railroad car wheels. The company began building wooden freight cars in the early 1880s, selling {{a large portion of}} its inventory to the Chesapeake and Ohio, Southern Pacific and Central Pacific railroads, all of which were controlled by Huntington. In 1962, the Huntington ACF plant began building a revolutionary new design that quickly became the standard of the rail car industry. The car, known as the CenterFlow <b>covered</b> <b>hopper</b> car, was developed by ACF to transport huge volumes of light-weight, high-bulk commodities, such as plastic pellets. By 1992, ACF had manufactured more than 100,000 hopper cars. The sprawling ACF Industries rail car plant once had many as 1,600 employees with an annual payroll of $30 million. Now, reports indicate only four people work there – and three of them are security guards.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, the Northern Pacific Railroad {{ordered a}} number of {{modified}} <b>covered</b> <b>hopper</b> cars from American Car and Foundry for transporting perishable food in bulk. The -long [...] cars were blanketed {{with a layer of}} insulation, equipped with roof hatches for loading, and had centerflow openings along the bottom for fast discharge. A mechanical refrigeration unit was installed {{at each end of the}} car, where sheet metal ducting forced cool air into the cargo compartments.|$|E
2500|$|Even loose loads such as coal, {{grain and}} ore {{can be carried}} in a boxcar with boards over the side door openings. [...] Later grain {{transport}} would use metal reinforced cardboard which was nailed over the door and could be punctured by a grain auger for unloading. This was more common in earlier days; it was susceptible to losing much loading during the journey, and damaged the boxcar. It was also impossible to mechanically load and unload. Grain can also be transported in boxcars designed specifically for that purpose; specialized equipment and procedures are required to load and unload the cars. However grain is better transported in <b>covered</b> <b>hopper</b> cars.|$|E

The former Johnson and Johnson plant in Milltown is now used by Silverline Windows, which receives many <b>covered</b> <b>hoppers</b> of plastic pellets.

50|$|As {{the next}} decade started for the Crab Orchard & Egyptian railroad, steam-powered freight service was still {{expanding}} and the railroad purchased several different freight cars of its own {{over the next few}} years; many of these included coal <b>hoppers,</b> <b>covered</b> <b>hoppers,</b> and 25 former Ahnapee & Western boxcars, all of which were lettered for the CO&E with their classic pyramid logo.|$|R

By the railroad's tenth anniversary in 1996, DM&E owned 69 locomotives and owned or leased over 1,500 cars including over 600 <b>covered</b> <b>hoppers</b> for grain and cement shipments. In 2001, the number of locomotives owned stayed about the same, while the number of cars increased to about 5,000 with 52% of them in dedicated grain service.|$|R
50|$|TrentonWorks has {{produced}} virtually {{every type of}} railway freight car imaginable, ranging from box cars to reefers, flat cars, tank cars, to modern-day high-capacity <b>covered</b> <b>hoppers,</b> auto racks, centre-partition flat cars for lumber, as well as deep well intermodal cars. Peak production output is approximately 50 cars per week. The TrentonWorks plant is currently operating below capacity due to decreased demand for new railcars with currently employment levels at 200 workers, however peak employment has ranged beyond 1,100 workers in recent years.|$|R

Flatcars and <b>covered</b> <b>hoppers</b> have been used for this purpose, but often the pushing platform is a caboose that has had its windows covered and welded shut and permanently locked doors.

50|$|<b>Covered</b> <b>hoppers</b> in North American service {{have been}} built {{by most of the}} freight car {{manufacturers}} of the 20th century. Originally, boxcars were used for the transport of bulk materials, but these had many disadvantages. Not having been specifically designed for this, {{it was very hard to}} use any form of bulk material handling to load or unload them. Also, a large amount of product was liable to be lost, either during loading or unloading, or in transit-since the cars had to be boarded up, rather than using the doors, to enclose the products.|$|R
50|$|The Mansfield branch {{was one of}} {{the last}} branch lines in the country to still use boxcars to move wheat. This method, by the early 1980s, was {{considered}} obsolete. New <b>covered</b> <b>hoppers</b> by this time were doing all of the grain hauling and the Mansfield Branch Line was too light to carry these cars. This was because the 68-pound-per-yard (34 kg/m) rail could not handle the larger hoppers that Burlington Northern Railroad had in its inventory. This and the increase of truck transportation led to the demise of the line.|$|R

50|$|American Railcar Industries is an American {{manufacturer}} and maintainer of hopper and tanker railcars, headquartered in Saint Charles, Missouri.

50|$|A {{hopper car}} {{is a type of}} {{railroad}} freight car used to transport loose bulk commodities such as coal, ore, grain, and track ballast. Two main types of hopper car exist: <b>covered</b> <b>hopper</b> cars, which are equipped with a roof, and open hopper cars, which do not have a roof.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, ARL owns over 25,000 {{tank and}} <b>covered</b> <b>hopper</b> cars (with their two most common {{reporting}} marks being ACFX and SHPX) and serves the petroleum, chemical, food, agriculture, fertilizer and plastic pellet markets.

Officially, the UT would be on their own again. To secure some funding to continue their operations, the UT tried to gain a subsidy from the United States Railway Association, which offered assistance to shortlines and the such. Operations continued in 1976 and even into 1977, with <b>covered</b> <b>hoppers</b> being delivered to Agrico, Agway at New Egypt, and Kube-Pak (a horticultural greenhouse business) at Imlaystown.|$|R
25|$|In 2012, an {{exhibition}} {{opened at the}} Grand Palais in Paris that sought {{to shed light on}} the complexity of his masterpieces, which is an indication of the richness of Hopper's oeuvre. It was divided chronologically into two main parts: the first section <b>covered</b> <b>Hopper's</b> formative years (1900–1924), comparing his work with that of his contemporaries and art he saw in Paris, which may have influenced him. The second section looked at the art of his mature years, from the first paintings emblematic of his personal style, such as House by the Railroad (1924), to his last works.|$|R
50|$|Currently {{as of the}} end of 2009, unmarked freight cars, {{particularly}} <b>covered</b> <b>hoppers,</b> are now parked {{and being}} stored along the southbound track in Perkasie between Market Street and Park Avenue, from Park Avenue to the Old Bethlehem Pike Bridge, and so on to Meetinghouse Road in Telford. East Penn through Perkasie with ex-Conrail B23-7 3153 runs about two to three times a week passing through Perkasie to Telford during a work day, and later again passing through Perkasie while heading back up to Quakertown. Times may vary in between but an average time between 10:00am and 4:00pm during the week.|$|R
