60|$|But {{let us be}} just to our friends. A {{large part}} is also due to the industrious earth-worm, whose place in nature Darwin first taught us to {{estimate}} at its proper worth. For there is much detritus and much first-rate soil even on hills not covered by glaciers. Some of this takes its origin, it is true, from disintegration by wind or rain, but much more {{is caused by the}} earth-worm in person. That friend of humanity, so little recognized in his true light, has a habit of drawing down leaves into his subterranean nest, and there eating them up, so as to convert their remains into vegetable mould in the form of worm-casts. This mould, the most precious of soils, gets dissolved again by the rain, and carried off in solution by the streams to the sea or the lowlands, where it helps to form the future <b>cultivable</b> <b>area.</b> At the same time the earthworms secrete an acid, which acts upon the bare surface of rock beneath, and helps to disintegrate it in preparation for plant life in unfavourable places. It is probable that we owe almost more on the whole to these unknown but conscientious and industrious annelids than even to those 'mills of God' the glaciers, of which the American poet justly observes that though they grind slowly, yet they grind exceedingly small.|$|E

30|$|Flooding is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} and recurrent abiotic stress in Bangladesh due to its agro-ecological and geo-climatic features. The majority of the <b>cultivable</b> <b>areas</b> of Bangladesh are in floodplains and therefore flood-prone (Fig.  12 a) with distinct types, intensities and depth (Fig.  12 a, b). Millions of hectares of <b>cultivable</b> <b>areas</b> are in risk of either river flooding or flash floods. In addition, over 2 million hectares {{are in danger of}} tidal surges (Fig.  12 a). Over 10 % of the areas of the total flood-prone zones may experience a flooding depth over 1.8  m. The majority of the area of rabi and pre-kharif seasons are also drought-prone due to the combined effect of climatic (Fig.  11) and agro-ecological features of the pre-monsoon season (March to May). However, the severity of drought depends on the land types of particular region, their soil texture and moisture holding capacity, permeability, drainage and number of dry days etc. Apart from drought and flood, a few other constraints: salinity, alkaline and acid sulphate soils hamper rice cultivation and expansion in Bangladesh (Fig.  12 d and Additional file  3 : Figure S 3). However, although the majority of the cultivable land are non-saline, hundreds of thousands of hectares of land, particularly in the costal belt areas (Additional file 3 : Figure S 3), suffer from salinity to various extents.|$|R
40|$|At {{the request}} of the French {{ministry}} of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, a study was carried out in 2009 by Laurence Roudart on the current and future availability of cultivable land. The three databases she analysed indicates that the land area utilisable for rainfed cultivation (without need of irrigation) that is not yet being farmed is, globally, very extensive - particularly in South America and Sub-Saharan Africa. On the other hand, this particular resource seems to be scarce or even to have been exhausted in the Middle East and Asia. Global warming would probably lead to a - small - increase in cultivable land, but would reduce the <b>cultivable</b> <b>areas</b> available in developing countries, particularly in South and South-East Asia, where such land is already a scarce resource. The world's <b>cultivable</b> <b>areas</b> seem greatly to exceed what is necessary to guarantee humanity's food security. This conclusion remains true even if we assume relatively low growth In agricultural yields along the lines of a "sustainable, doubly green revolution" and exclude from cultivation all the currently protected zones and the forests. It is true even if we take into account the plausible effects of global warming. However, the sustainable exploitation of cultivable land resources requires appropriate public policies on agricultural prices, on access to land, and on research-and-development targeted at the needs and potential of poor producers.

There is most (relatively) agricultural {{population in the}} Bjelovar region (38. 5 %), whereas it has almost vanished from the Kvamer-Velebit littoral (1. 85). It is scarce in Istria (6. 5 %), in Gorski kotar (4. 6 %), on the Dalmatian coast and the islands (5. 0 %). This {{segment of the population}} is rapidly ageing: only 6. 6 % are under the age of ten, whereas there are 15. 3 % people under ten in the non-agricultural population. The sex composition is also shifted: there is a pronounced shortage of men (only 43. 8 %). Of the total agricultural population of Croatia, 62. 1 % people are active. The others are maintained. There are significant regional differences. To analyze the »vitality« of Croatian agriculture we singled out an active agricultural contingent aged between 15 and 59. The level of education in the vital agricultural population is exceedingly unfavourable. 80 % of them have no school at all or did not complette their primary education. Statistical data available was used to estimate the vitality of agriculture. Everyone younger than 15 and older than 59 was excluded. This reduced the total active agricultural contingent in Croatia by almost 30 %. Available <b>cultivable</b> <b>areas</b> are {{the second part of the}} »index of vitality«. The number of hectares per »vital« farmer shows the locality and nature of Croatia’s agricultural potentials. This certainly needs additional analyses, but even on this level the facts are very indicative: the parts of Croatia where the agricultural population is sparse have large <b>cultivable</b> <b>areas</b> per one »vital« farmer — up to 32. 1 ha in Gorski kotar or 18. 1 ha in Istria. There is least cultivable land per »vital« farmer in the Hrvatsko Zagorje (3. 3 ha) and in the Varaždin region (3. 3 ha). The agriculturally overpopulated Bjelovar region has 4. 3 ha per farmer, the Zagreb urban region 4. 8 ha, and the other regions are close to the national average (5. 6 ha). This analysis of agricultural »vitality« points to great imbalance in the distribution of fanners and land in Croatia.
