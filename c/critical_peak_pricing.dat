40|$|Peak {{demand for}} {{electricity}} in North America {{is expected to}} grow, challenging electrical utilities to supply this demand in a cost-effective, reliable manner. Therefore, there is growing interest in strategies to reduce peak demand by eliminating electricity use, or shifting it to non-peak times. This strategy is commonly called "demand response". In households, common strategies are time-varying pricing, which charge more for energy use on peak, or direct load control, which allows utilities to curtail certain loads during high demand periods. We reviewed recent North American studies of these strategies. The {{data suggest that the}} most effective strategy is a <b>critical</b> <b>peak</b> <b>price</b> (CPP) program with enabling technology to automatically curtail loads on event days. There is little evidence that this causes substantial hardship for occupants, particularly if they have input into which loads are controlled and how, and have an override option. In such cases, a peak load reduction of at least 30 % is a reasonable expectation. It might be possible to attain such load reductions without enabling technology by focusing on household types more likely to respond, and providing them with excellent support.

40|$|California {{electric}} utilities have been exploring {{the use of}} dynamic <b>critical</b> <b>peak</b> <b>prices</b> (CPP) and other demand response programs to help reduce peaks in customer electric loads. CPP is a tariff design to promote demand response. Levels of automation in DR {{can be defined as}} follows: Manual Demand Response involves a potentially labor-intensive approach such as manually turning off or changing comfort set points at each equipment switch or controller. Semi-Automated Demand Response involves a pre-programmed demand response strategy initiated by a person via centralized control system. Fully Automated Demand Response does not involve human intervention, but is initiated at a home, building, or facility through receipt of an external communications signal. The receipt of the external signal initiates pre-programmed demand response strategies. They refer to this as Auto-DR. This paper describes the development, testing, and results from automated CPP (Auto-CPP) as part of a utility project in California. The paper presents the project description and test methodology. This is followed by a discussion of Auto-DR strategies used in the field test buildings. They present a sample Auto-CPP load shape case study, and a selection of the Auto-CPP response data from September 29, 2005. If all twelve sites reached their maximum saving simultaneously, a total of approximately 2 MW of DR is available from these twelve sites that represent about two million ft{sup 2 }. The average DR was about half that value, at about 1 MW. These savings translate to about 0. 5 to 1. 0 W/ft{sup 2 } of demand reduction.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the results of a dynamic pricing {{experiment}} that compares the performance of three popular pricing programs–hourly pricing, <b>critical</b> <b>peak</b> <b>pricing,</b> and critical peak-pricing with a rebate–for a representative sample from the population of households in the District of Columbia. The sampled households differ in terms of their income levels, electricityusing appliance holdings and whether they own a smart thermostat. Using a nonparametric conditional mean estimation framework that allows for customer-specific fixed effects and hourof-sample fixed effects, I find that customers on all of the dynamic pricing programs substantially reduce their electricity consumption during high-priced periods. The hourly average treatment effects associated with each of these dynamic pricing plans are larger in absolute value for households with all-electric heating and households with smart thermostats. Low-income households have significantly larger hourly average treatment effects than higher income households on the same dynamic-pricing tariff. The results of these experiments are also used to investigate two hypotheses about differences in the customer-level demand response to the three dynamic pricing tariffs. Specifically, I find that for roughly the same marginal price during a critical peak period, <b>critical</b> <b>peak</b> <b>pricing</b> yields a larger hourly average demand reduction than <b>critical</b> <b>peak</b> <b>pricing</b> with a rebate.

40|$|California {{utilities}} {{have been}} exploring {{the use of}} critical peak prices (CPP) to help reduce needle peaks in customer end-use loads. CPP {{is a form of}} price-responsive demand response (DR). Recent experience has shown that customers have limited knowledge of how to operate their facilities in order to reduce their electricity costs under CPP (Quantum 2004). While the lack of knowledge about how to develop and implement DR control strategies is a barrier to participation in DR programs like CPP, another barrier is the lack of automation of DR systems. During 2003 and 2004, the PIER Demand Response Research Center (DRRC) conducted a series of tests of fully automated electric demand response (Auto-DR) at 18 facilities. Overall, the average of the site-specific average coincident demand reductions was 8 % from a variety of building types and facilities. Many electricity customers have suggested that automation will help them institutionalize their electric demand savings and improve their overall response and DR repeatability. This report focuses on and discusses the specific results of the Automated <b>Critical</b> <b>Peak</b> <b>Pricing</b> (Auto-CPP, a specific type of Auto-DR) tests that took place during 2005, which build on the automated demand response (Auto-DR) research conducted through PIER and the DRRC in 2003 and 2004. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the technical opportunities of automating demand response and to remove technical and market impediments to large-scale implementation of automated demand response (Auto-DR) in buildings and industry.
