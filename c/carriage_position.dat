However, {{there is still}} no clear guideline regarding where the backpack centre of gravity (CG) should be positioned. The changes of spinal curvature and repositioning error when carrying a backpack loaded at 15 % of body weight at different CG locations (anterior or posterior at T 7, T 12 or L 3) in schoolchildren were analysed. Both spinal curvature and repositioning error were found to be affected by backpack anterior-posterior position and CG level. A relatively smaller change was observed during anterior carriage with the least change when the backpack CG was positioned at T 12. The results also suggested that alternative carriage by changing the backpack position occasionally between anterior and posterior positions might help to relieve the effects of backpack on spine. However, future study is recommended to further substantiate the beneficial effects of alternative carriage on children.

Simulations were carried out {{to better understand the}} fluid–structure interactions of the unsteady, turbulent flow and the store. Mach and Reynolds numbers (based on the missile diameter) were 0. 85 and 326. 000 respectively. Spectral analysis showed few differences in the frequency content in the cavity between the store with rigid and flexible fins. However, a large effect of the store position was seen. When the store was placed inside the cavity, the noise reduction reached 7 dB close to the cavity ceiling. The closer the store to the <b>carriage</b> <b>position,</b> the more coherent and quieter was the cavity. To perform a more realistic simulation, a gap of 0. 3 % of the store diameter was introduced between the fin root and the body of the store. Store loads showed little differences between the rigid and flexible fins when the store was inside and outside the cavity. With the store at the shear layer, the flexible fins were seen to have a reduction in loads with large fluctuations in position about a mean. Fin-tip displacements of the store inside the cavity were of the range of 0. 2 % of the store diameter, and in the range of 1 – 2 % of store diameter when at the shear layer...|$|E
40|$|During {{the primary}} {{transformation}} in wood industry, logs {{are faced with}} conical rough milling cutters commonly named slabber or canter heads. Chips produced consist of raw materials for pulp paper and particleboard industries. The process efficiency of these industries partly comes from particle size distribution. However, chips formation is greatly dependent on milling conditions and material variability. Thus, this study aims at better understanding and predicting chips production in wood milling. The different mechanisms of their formation are studied through orthogonal cutting experiments at high cutting speed for beech and Douglas fir. Within these conditions, ejection of free water inside wood can be observed during fragmentation, particularly on beech. As previously seen in quasi-static experiments, chip thickness {{is proportional to the}} nominal cut thickness. Moreover, the grain orientation has a great influence on the cutting mechanisms, so as the nominal cut and the grows rings widths. This chip fragmentation study finally allows the improvement of the cutting conditions in rough milling. In order to optimize machine design as well as cutting geometry, a geometrical model of a generic slabber head is developed. This model allows the study of the effective cutting kinematics, the log-cutting edges interactions and the effective wood grain direction during cutting.

40|$|Modern {{military}} aircraft employ weapon bays for carriage and release of stores. The clearance of these stores for release from aircraft may require several flight tests {{at a range}} of conditions where the trajectories of released stores are obtained through accelerometers located on the store. Although effective, this is expensive and time consuming and only limited flight tests can be accomplished at critical conditions. Predictions made using store release analysis through wind tunnels and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{have the potential to}} reduce the number of flight tests required for store clearance. The motivation for the current work, stems from the need to investigate carriage and release of a store from a weapon bay, idealised as a rectangular cavity, through a unique blend of disciplines comprising Computational Fluid Dynamics, Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD), Computational Aero- Aeroacoustics (CAA) and High Performance Computing (HPC). Detached-Eddy Simulations (DES) of flow in clean cavities were carried out to compare two cavities of different aspect ratios for configurations with doors-off and doors-on. Both cavities had similar acoustic signatures and the addition of doors channelled the flow causing acoustic waves to propagate further away from the cavity. DES computations were carried out for a store at different positions relative to a cavity that showed that a store at <b>carriage</b> <b>position</b> pacified the cavity acoustics the most. Fin tip displacements were small for a store at <b>carriage</b> <b>position</b> and exhibited buzzing characteristics. This was similar to the case where a store was positioned at the shear layer of a cavity but with slightly larger displacements. While fin displacements were not large, the results highlighted concerns for fin fatigue life. Comparisons between rigid and elastic fins showed small differences in loads, however, aeroelastic simulations showed that where resonance of structural and cavity modes occurred, large amplitude fin oscillations were predicted. Scale-Adaptive Simulations (SAS) were validated against experimental data for clean cavities and were found to be similar to DES results and could be run at a larger time-step. The cost savings and similarities of SAS to DES encouraged its use for store release computations. Store release computations from a cavity were conducted and the variability of a stores trajectory due to the unsteady cavity flow-field was investigated. Visualisations using Q-criteria highlighted instantaneous structures that were in contact with the store fins causing the trajectory to vary for different release times. Overall, the thesis suggests the use of SAS as an affordable method for analysing store release computations from a cavity and highlights the need for a stochastic evaluation of trajectories from transonic cavities. A study comparing different signal lengths for post-processing unsteady pressure data revealed that, the minimum CFD signal length required to capture all dominant tones was around 0. 05 s. Different post-processing methods for spectral content were compared and the use of Maximum Entropy Methods (MEMs), based on Burgs Estimator, was suggested as it not only captured dominant tones but also predicted the highest Sound Pressure Levels (SPLs), that could be used to produce the maximum boundary of a given signal...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA current {{drawback}} in {{high performance}} machining is the dynamic {{behavior of the}} machine tool. The dedicated Eigenfrequencies of the machine tool structure lead to not optimal cutting parameters due to the danger of chatter. Possibilities to overcome this drawback are on one hand the unwanted variation of the cutting parameters {{and on the other}} hand the variation of the dynamic properties of the machine tool components. The variation of the dynamic properties of these components requires high efforts and expenses. An approach to easily vary the dynamic characteristic of the machine tool is a carriage made out of Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) with adequate mass shifting by filling the built in chambers with a fluid. This leads to shifted Eigenfrequencies and therefore to optimal cutting parameters without chatter. The mass ratio between the empty lightweight machine tool carriage made out of CFRP and the one filled enables a significant frequency shift. Within this paper three issues will be addressed: first the frequency shift depending on the <b>carriage's</b> <b>position</b> will be examined, the frequency shift according to the filling strategy will be shown and finally the amplitude reduction related to the external excitation will be presented...|$|R

40|$|Sediment {{transport}} studies incorporating {{radio frequency}} identification (RFID) tracers are becoming a key component in understanding sediment transport dynamics due to the data they provide on spatial and temporal variability. This technique involves inserting small glass cylindrical transponders into stones then seeding those stones in the river bed. Existing methods of using RFID tracers involve either manually sweeping the channel bed after a hydrologic event or placing a series of fixed antennas along the channel to detect when sediment containing a RFID tracer passes that point. The first method is limited {{because it does not}} correlate the hydrodynamic conditions with the movement of the sediment, while the second method is limited by spatial resolution afforded by the fixed antennas. The goal of this research is to develop a flume with the capacity to accurately measure sediment inputs, transport, and export in real time. This is accomplished by automating the sediment supply, using a sediment trap with a light table to monitor sediment leaving the flume, and implementing an RFID sediment tracking system to provide real time tracking of the movement of individual clasts over the course of an experiment. A tilting flume with sediment supply and capture systems was designed and built with an integrated RFID tracking system to enable sediment transport experiments to be conducted in the flume while continuously tracking the position of RFID tagged sediment. The RFID tracking system, located under the floor of the flume, consists of a carriage containing the antennas, tuners, multiplexing RFID readers, batteries, and rollers to enable the carriage to roll along the flanges of the beam supporting the flume. The carriage is transported back and forth the length of the flume using cogged belts and pulleys powered by a DC motor and controlled by a PLC with limit switches. The identification of RFID tags detected by the carriage is transmitted Bluetooth to a stationary computer that also receives <b>carriage</b> <b>position</b> information from a laser range finder. Validation tests were conducted with vertically oriented RFID tags to establish the detection range and accuracy of estimating RFID tag positions. When no steel cross members were present, an RFID tag could be detected up to 21 cm above the flume floor with streamwise position estimation accurate within 1 cm. When steel cross members or multiple RFID tags were present, the detection range and position estimation accuracy decreased. Further refinement to this technique could be achieve by experimenting with different antenna designs which may provide a larger detection range and by using different type of PIT tags to enable tracking of smaller sized sediment. The developed flume and tracking system will allow us to obtain new and better information about sediment transport which should improve fundamental understanding and aid in the design of channel restoration projects...|$|E

English state originates from the same root, through Old French estat, from Latin status ("manner of standing, attitude, <b>position,</b> <b>carriage,</b> manner, dress, apparel; and other senses"), from stare. In Polish and Ukrainian, [...] means [...] "state" [...] or [...] "condition", while in Serbo-Croatian it translates as [...] "apartment" [...] (a Slovenian word [...] "stanovanje" [...] means apartment or other closed space of living is an obvious derivative of stan) in its modern usage, while its original meaning was [...] "habitat". In Czech and Slovak, it means [...] "tent" [...] or, in military terms, [...] "headquarters". Also in Germanic languages, the root can be found in Stand ("place, location"), and in Stadt (German), stad/sted (Dutch/Scandinavian), stêd (West Frisian) and stead (English), all meaning either [...] "place" [...] or [...] "city". The suffix -stan is analogous to the suffix -land, present in many country and location names.|$|R
