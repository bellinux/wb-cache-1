40|$|Aim : Root {{hydraulic}} conductivity {{is one of}} the main factors that control water flow in the soil-plant system and ultimately affect crop irrigation requirements. This work sets out to estimate root <b>water</b> <b>conductivity</b> for three self-rooted or grafted table grape cultivars. Methods and results : We evaluated root <b>water</b> <b>conductivity</b> of the cultivars ‘Black Magic’, ‘Matilde’ and ‘Victoria’ grafted onto 1103 Paulsen rootstock or self-rooted. Measurements were performed on two-year-old table grapes grown in pots filled with pumice. Root <b>water</b> <b>conductivity</b> was determined by placing the pots in a pressure chamber and increasing pressures from 0. 05 to 0. 30 MPa, at intervals of 0. 05 MPa. Plant growth in terms of shoot and root dry matter was also evaluated, as well as leaf and root area. Conclusion : Root <b>water</b> <b>conductivity</b> differed according to cultivar and grafting. The ‘Victoria’ cultivar had higher root <b>water</b> <b>conductivity</b> than the other two, which differed little between them. The grafted plants showed higher root <b>water</b> <b>conductivity</b> than the self-rooted plants, except the plants of the cultivar ‘Matilde’, whose root <b>water</b> <b>conductivity</b> for the grafted and self-rooted plants was almost the same.
