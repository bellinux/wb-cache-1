40|$|Lightning {{strikes in}} January 2014 caused {{a number of}} {{significant}} bushfire events in South Australia that continued into February. Fires in and around Eden Valley, Bangor and Rockleigh provided an opportunity to conduct research into the bushfire risk perceptions, decision‐making processes and behaviour of residents across three very different fire events involving a rapid‐onset fire (Eden Valley), a long <b>campaign</b> <b>fire</b> (Bangor), and repeat fire incidents (Rockleigh). During April and May 2014, 171 residents in affected communities were interviewed and 606 South Australians participated in a complementary online (statewide) survey. Approximately one in two (49 %) survey respondents considered their residential area to have been impacted by fire, and almost one in five (17 %) indicated that they were directly impacted by the fires, and one in five (20 %) experienced fire threat without property damage. The aim of the research was to inform SA Country Fire Service about community members’ experiences of bushfires in South Australia, with particular attention to a range of research questions grouped under the three themes discussed below. The nature of the study has allowed us to provide observations and insights on each one of these themes. However, {{it should be noted that}} cause and effect relationships between the factors should not be inferred. [Summary continued in report...|$|E
