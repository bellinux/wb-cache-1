Later that year, the county proposed an extension of the freeway east to US80 and Third Street in El Cajon. In 1966, the U.S. Army's Board of Engineers supported the construction of the flood channel, to protect future development in the surrounding region from flooding; the integration of SR54 was included in the proposal.|$|E

This reach of San Juan Creek is {{underlain}} by thick alluvial deposits and is still used for farming and grazing. It is joined by Bell Canyon from the right, from several residential communities that overlook, but do not border, it. and Verdugo Canyon Creek from the left. Trampas Canyon enters from the left and Cañada Gobernadora and Cañada Chiquita enter from the right. The creek flows through residential Rancho Mission Viejo, crosses under Interstate 5, and enters a concrete flood <b>control</b> <b>channel,</b> turning south and receiving El Horno Creek on the right. It receives its largest tributary, Trabuco Creek, from the right, then flows south toward the Pacific Ocean. The creek forms a fresh water lagoon at the northern end of Doheny State Beach, which overflows into Capistrano Bay during periods of high flow.|$|E

After passing beneath the interstate, it is abruptly diverted into a trapezoidal flood <b>control</b> <b>channel,</b> with concrete levees and an earthen riverbed. The creek flows southwest, arcing gradually south, and very soon receives the underground discharge of El Horno Creek {{on the right}} bank. A few hundred yards past El Horno, San Juan Creek receives its largest tributary, Trabuco Creek, on the right bank. Trabuco Creek begins in the northeastern corner of the watershed and drains most of the watershed's north half. It flows primarily west then south-southwest, through a valley that is generally more developed {{than that of the}} mainstem. For much of its lower third, it winds alongside Interstate 5. At river mile 4 (river kilometer 6.4) it receives its major tributary, Oso Creek, on its right bank.

500|$|Although many South Pasadena {{residents}} {{opposed the}} division of the city that the parkway would bring, the city's voters elected supporters in the 1936 elections. The state, which had the power to put the road where it wished even had South Pasadena continued to oppose it, approved the route on April 4, 1936. The route used the Arroyo Seco's west bank to near Hough Street, where it crossed to the east and cut through South Pasadena to the south end of Broadway (now Arroyo Parkway) in Pasadena. Another project, the Arroyo Seco Flood <b>Control</b> <b>Channel,</b> was built by the Works Progress Administration before and during construction of the parkway to avoid damages from future floods. A number of state engineers toured East Coast roads in early 1938, including Chicago's Lake Shore Drive, full and modified cloverleaf interchanges in Massachusetts and New Jersey, and Robert Moses's parkway system in New York City. The parkway was the first road built in California under a 1939 freeway law that allowed access to be completely limited to a number of specified points. Although, in some areas, it was possible to use a standard diamond interchange, other locations required folded diamonds, or, as the engineers called them, [...] "compressed cloverleafs", where local streets often took the place of dedicated ramps, ending at the parkway with a sharp right turn required to enter or exit. The highway was designed with two 11–12foot (3.4-3.7m) lanes and one ten-foot (3.0m) shoulder in each direction, with the wider inside (passing) lanes paved in black asphalt concrete and the outside lanes paved in gray Portland cement concrete. The differently-colored lanes would encourage drivers to stay in their lanes. (By mid-1939, the state had decided to replace the shoulders with additional travel lanes for increased capacity; except on a short piece in South Pasadena, these were also paved with Portland cement. So that disabled vehicles could be safely removed from the roadway, about 50 [...] "safety bays" [...] were constructed in 1949 and 1950.) The engineers used a design speed of , superelevating curves where necessary to accomplish this. (The road is now posted at [...]) Despite the freeway design, many parkway characteristics were incorporated, such as plantings of mostly native flora alongside the road.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} theoretical {{security system}} {{is based on}} an enhancement of the resiliency against radio jamming of the PBCH by means of a spread spectrum transmission. This can be combined with scrambling of the PRB allocation of UL <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> and a distributed encryption scheme for downlink control broadcast messages. On one hand, the system protects its most vulnerable resources, downlink <b>control</b> <b>channels,</b> which are the target of DoS attacks[6]. On the other hand, MIB and SIB messages are protected so an attacker cannot learn any information on the PRB allocation for the other <b>control</b> <b>channels,</b> which are now randomly allocated in time and frequency. Only with the information encoded and encrypted in the MIB and SIB messages an attacker would be able to aim to the UL <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> with a jamming charge. Full application of such security solutions render a jamming attack to be only as effective as basic barrage jamming. Note that in jamming mitigation studies, the goal is precisely to force any sophisticated jamming attack to be just as efficient as standard jamming[17].|$|R

The [...] {{reservoir}} is formed by the [...] Santiago Dam, located at its north end. Irvine Lake provides water to Villa Park and Orange via a pipeline and flume to Peters Canyon Reservoir.

40|$|The {{potential}} of relay selection (RS) {{has been well}} appreciated. However if the <b>control</b> <b>channels,</b> conveying information on the selected relay node (RN), are unreliable, the gains of RS diminish.

Furthermore, more than one of the RNs might end up transmitting, an event that could be performance degrading. It is also likely that no RN transmits, which is very undesirable. In this paper we assume decode-and-forward and present closed form expressions for the outage probability (OP) under Rayleigh fading when two potential RNs are available and the control information related to RS is corrupted by errors. We show that when <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> are unreliable, the OP performance degrades significantly and reaches a floor as the signal-to-noise ratio of the RN-to-destination data channel grows.
