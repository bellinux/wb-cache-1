Should it attempt any other system calls, the kernel will terminate the process with SIGKILL.

40|$|Abstract—Private data {{comes in}} many forms: web browser histories, chat logs, {{sensitive}} word processor documents, net-work proxy logs, and many more. Some applications – pri-marily web browsers – now support private modes that aim to prevent sensitive information leaks. There are two {{problems with this}} application-level approach. First, there are many software engineering challenges in implementing correct and complete private modes. More fundamentally, applications cannot always tell which data is private – this {{is up to the}} user. As a result, applications that do support private modes may not implement the user’s desired policy, and many other applications that process private data do not have a private mode at all, because the developers did not consider that use case. In this paper, we present a case for private <b>computing</b> <b>mode</b> as a system service, rather than a per-application feature. We specify the threat model and the goals of the private <b>computing</b> <b>mode,</b> and argue that the applications alone cannot achieve these goals.

Under the same computer hardware condition, the antibody DNA sequences from two animals, zebrafish and mouse, were aligned using CPU-GPU hybrid mode and CPU-only mode respectively, then their performances were compared. The experimental result demonstrates that the computing speed of CPU-GPU hybrid mode on sequence alignment is up to 50 times faster than that of CPU-only mode.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a multi-user mobile edge computing (MEC) network powered by {{wireless power transfer}} (WPT), where each energy-harvesting WD follows a binary computation offloading policy, i. e., data set of a task has to be executed as a whole either locally or remotely at the MEC server via task offloading. In particular, {{we are interested in}} maximizing the (weighted) sum computation rate of all the WDs in the network by jointly optimizing the individual <b>computing</b> <b>mode</b> selection (i. e., local computing or offloading) and the system transmission time allocation (on WPT and task offloading). The major difficulty lies in the combinatorial nature of multi-user <b>computing</b> <b>mode</b> selection and its strong coupling with transmission time allocation. To tackle this problem, we first consider a decoupled optimization, where we assume that the mode selection is given and propose a simple bi-section search algorithm to obtain the conditional optimal time allocation. On top of that, a coordinate descent method is devised to optimize the mode selection. The method is simple in implementation but may suffer from high computational complexity in a large-size network. To address this problem, we further propose a joint optimization method based on the ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) decomposition technique, which enjoys much slower increase of computational complexity as the networks size increases. Extensive simulations show that both the proposed methods can efficiently achieve near-optimal performance under various network setups, and significantly outperform the other representative benchmark methods considered.
