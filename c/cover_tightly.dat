50|$|DenotingAn entity (thing, place, event) {{or class}} of {{entities}} may be denoted by giving its name, {{the class to}} which it belongs, and the function it serves. The denoting communication may also include identification of {{the parts of the}} entity, their locations, and functions. As an example, a hawser is denoted as a large rope (its class) for towing or moving a ship (its function). Denoting may also proceed to indicate parts, such as the hawser bend (used for connecting two hawsers) and a hawser clamp (a device for gripping a hawser). Entities other than objects may be denoted, such as persons, places, or events. Examples might be the U. S. Attorney General, the city of St. Louis, the 1988 baseball World Series. An enterprise of this sort is a part of many human occupations such as teaching, explaining, orienting, counseling, and giving directions. ManifestingActions involving entities as actors or objects may be arranged in a series of steps leading to a particular result. Such a series is called a process, and it is this that is the object of a manifesting enterprise. Learners must gain knowledge of the steps in the process. A manifesting enterprise consists of making a process evident to other people (e.g., students, co-workers) by indicating its stages and their sequence. Manifesting a process implies going beyond employing a simple verbal communication; it may require the use of pictures or props, as is commonly done in a demonstration. An example of manifesting a process occurs when a student can indicate the stages in the life cycle of an insect and can show how these stages vary under different environmental conditions. DiscoveringThe enterprise of discovering reveals (to observers) a previously unknown novel entity or process. Often, entities and the procedures for manipulating them are inventions. One of the most creative types of enterprise involves the capability to design or discover a novel entity or procedure. For example, to remove tight covers from jars, a learner might discover the design of an object that grips the <b>cover</b> <b>tightly,</b> making possible its unscrewing from the jar. Alternatively, a learner might discover a procedure that would cause the cover to loosen its grip on the jar by metal expansion. As another example, having knowledge of control mechanisms in mechanical systems, a learner may discover a hypothesis about biological control mechanisms which trigger phases of the life cycle of insects.|$|E

40|$|Assessment {{of erosion}} in a {{watershed}} {{is very important}} for the purpose of determining whether a watershed has been degraded and damaged or not, so it is useful for the planning of the future for the watershed areas so as to achieve sustainable land use and environmentally friendly. Study of erosion prediction and mapping erosion hazard rate (TBE), and determine the rate of erosion that can be tolerated in a variety of land units, and determining alternative land use followed by the appropriate conservation measures in order to suppress erosion as small as possible or equal to Etol (tolerable erosion) has conducted research on upstream Mangau Padang Pariaman and Agam districts. The study lasted in September 2011 until January 2012. The experiment was conducted using the survey method. Secondary data obtained from statistical data, maps and the results of previous researches. The results showed that the greatest erosion occurs in people's gardens land units with steep slopes (KrF), with a percentage of 62 % slope and slope length of 45 m. While the smallest erosion occurs in wetland units with a gentle slope (SWB), the percentage of 7 % slope and slope length of 28 m. Land units experiencing mild erosion rate is 37. 80 %, of the total study area. Then the land units suffered heavy erosion rate is as much as 20. 81 %, and further land experiencing very severe erosion hazard level is sebayak 37. 86 % of the total study area. Actual erosion rate greater than can be tolerated erosion found 4 unit of land is the garden of the people with a rather steep slope (KrD), mixed garden with a rather steep slope (KcD), and their fields with steep slopes (KrF). Furthermore, there are 8 land unit value erosion rate is less than the erosion rates that can be tolerated so that the use of the land does not need changing. Alternative use of land for every land units that have greater erosion speed of the tolerable erosion is the land units of protected forest with steep slopes (HlF), the secondary forest with steep slopes (HsF). Whereas, the land unit of rice paddy soil with relatively steep slopes (SwD), rice paddy soil with gentle slopes (SwB), scrub with relatively steep slopes (SmD), scrub with steep slopes (SmF) and farm people with mild slopes (KrB) fixed defended. Furthermore, the alternative use of the land for the unit of farm people with steep slopes (KrF) and farm people with relatively steep slopes (KrD) and a mixture of garden soil units with relatively steep slopes (KcD) is recommended for improved by adding high density mixed garden and make bench terrrace with good construction and land <b>cover</b> <b>tightly</b> coupled...|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the Spanish the {{indigenous}} settlements constructions varied in architectural techniques. Most of the base of the houses were constructed with stones glued together with clay on a flattened terrain, the walls were made using a bareke mix, miking clay, intricate sticks and hay to create solid walls. The roof had a frame of solid sticks forming a cone and <b>covered</b> <b>tightly</b> in grass or palm branches. Indigenous like the Arhuacos had developed villages in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range which interconnected their houses through a system of stone roads and steps.

30|$|Aphelenchoides besseyi was {{isolated}} from the infested seed of cultivar Halilbey and reared on a carrot culture as described by Tulek et al. (2009). Briefly, newly harvested carrots were peeled in a laminar flow hood and then surface sterilized in ethanol (95 %) for 5  min. The alcohol was evaporated by a gentle flame with the Bunsen burner, and the carrots were peeled again and cut into 1 -cm-thick segments. Three segments were placed in a 9 -cm-diameter Petri dish. A. besseyi individuals were collected from rice panicles by using a modified Baermann funnel method, and the surfaces of the nematodes were sterilized with streptomycin sulfate (0.l %) for 10  min. One surface-sterilized female was transferred onto a carrot segment in each Petri dish. The plates were <b>covered</b> <b>tightly</b> with parafilm and placed in an incubator at 22 [*]±[*] 1  °C to allow the nematodes to develop and reproduce. Four months later, a mixture of nematode stages was harvested by adding a sufficient amount of sterile water to the Petri dishes.

40|$|To {{study the}} effect of glass fiber (GF) surface {{modified}} by nano-SiO 2 on mechanical properties of GF reinforced matrix composites, vacuum-assisted mold pressing (VAMP) technology was adopted to prepare polymerized poly(cyclic butylene terephthalate) (PCBT) -based composites reinforced by GF modified by various nano-SiO 2 on the surface. The effect of GF surface modification on mechanical properties of the obtained GF/PCBT composites was investigated and the hygrothermal aging resistance of GF/PCBT composites with modified GF was further studied. The fiber pull-out test {{results show that the}} interface shear strength of GF/PCBT composites enhances by 1. 16 times after nano modification on fiber surface. With nano-SiO 2 content of 0. 5 wt%, 2 wt% (mass ratio of nano-SiO 2 to PCBT), the three-point flexural strength of GF/PCBT composites increases by 1. 5 times and 1. 67 times, flexural modulus increases by 1. 03 times and 1. 17 times, respectively. Observations by SEM show that the damaged fibers are <b>covered</b> <b>tightly</b> by PCBT resin when nano-SiO 2 content is 2 wt%, which is an indication of good bonding properties between the matrix and fibers. Under hygrothermal conditions, hydrone diffusion along the interphase region is hindered and results in the enhancement of the anti-aging performance of the modified GF/PCBT composites, due to the existence of nano-SiO 2 particles.

Cut the dough into 48 strips, (4 inch x 1/2 inch). Place 48 strips in 24 pairs, {{one on top of}} each other. Heat a wok with about 2 cups oil hot enough for deep frying. Lightly press a joined strip in the lengthwise center with a chopstick, making the impression only immediately before frying, then stretch to 8 inch. Gently lower into hot oil. Turn the strips and push them into the oil so they cook right through and brown evenly. Don’t fry too many at once as the temperature of the oil will drop, the dough will absorb more oil and become greasy. Fry until golden brown and puffy. Remove and drain on rack on paper.|$|R

30|$|The primary {{fermentation}} {{was initiated}} {{by the addition of}} the starter culture. The must was stirred every 12  h with subsequent reading of the specific gravity, pH, temperature and alcohol content for 4  days. After 4  days, the wine was racked into the secondary fermenter. The secondary fermentation was done in an air tight container in which a tube was passed into a clean bottle containing clean water. The essence was to monitor the course of fermentation. This was allowed until completion of fermentation as was evidenced by lack of the appearance of bubbles in the container usually within 3  weeks. Secondary fermentation was done for 21  days. When fermentation stopped, the wine was promptly racked off the lees ensuring minimum exposure to oxygen. After secondary fermentation, the wines were clarified. The clarification/fining were done using bentonite (a clarifying agent). Exactly 500  g of bentonite was dissolved in two litres of boiling water and stirred properly to a gel form. This was allowed to stand for 24  h. Then 150  g of the gel-like bentonite was transferred into each of the wine followed by stirring to dissolve properly. A small quantity of the mixture was collected in a clean bottle which was <b>covered</b> <b>tightly</b> and was used to monitor the process of clarification. This was done for a period of 3  months. Filtration was done after the wines had completed clarification using muslin cloth, sieve and syphon tubes sterilized by 70  % alcohol. The wines was syphoned into the sieve containing four layers of muslin cloth. The residues were removed and the filtrates were allowed to mature for a period of 6  months before other chemical analysis was carried out.|$|R
30|$|The cell {{biological}} investigations on mixed multilayers further {{reveal that}} the PEM film conformation is not sensed as a property of a homogeneous 3 D-volume phase by the cells, since a difference in cell density was observed on PGA compared to CS terminated films. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} (PLL-PGA)n–(PLL-CS)x multilayers display a bizonal structure with distinct polypeptide conformations. When the number of CS bilayers x increases the superficial, random coiled zones <b>covers</b> the <b>tightly</b> packed underlying (PLL-PGA)n. Consequently, both the content of conformation B in the film volume and the conformation of the surface exposed layers affect the cell response. When the top layers of the mixed multilayers with similar content of conformation B are composed of random coiled chains, their inherent mechanical softness negatively interferes with cell spreading and proliferation.|$|R
