40|$|International audienceObjective: To {{propose a}} method to build <b>customized</b> <b>sets</b> of MedDRA terms for the {{description}} of a medical condition. We illustrate this method with upper gastrointestinal bleedings (UGIB). Research design and methods: We created a broad list of MedDRA terms related to UGIB and defined a gold standard {{with the help of}} experts. MedDRA terms were formally described in a semantic resource named OntoADR. We report the use of two semantic queries that automatically select candidate terms for UGIB. Query 1 is a combination of two SNOMED CT concepts describing both morphology ‘Hemorrhage’ and finding site ‘Upper digestive tract structure’. Query 2 complements Query 1 by taking into account MedDRA terms associated to SNOMED CT concepts describing clinical manifestations ‘Melena’ or ‘Hematemesis’. Results: We compared terms in queries and our gold standard achieving a recall of 71. 0 % and a precision of 81. 4 % for query 1 (F 1 score 0. 76); and a recall of 96. 7 % and a precision of 77. 0 % for query 2 (F 1 score 0. 86). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of applying knowledge engineering techniques for building <b>customized</b> <b>sets</b> of MedDRA terms.

The result of the test shows that the students’ scores range between 33 and 96 words, with the mean score of 66. It means that the students’ vocabulary size ranges between 3, 300 and 9, 600 word families.

40|$|In unit {{selection}} based speech synthesizer, {{defining a}} good unit set {{is crucial to}} the speech quality. In this paper, a method of customizing the TTS base unit set with a specific speech corpus is proposed. Multi-phoneme units are boosted from the initial phoneme-sized unit. A new multi-phoneme unit is added to the inventory based upon its own frequency count and the affected frequency count of other units. As a result, a large base unit set, which contains many multi-phoneme units, is formed when the speech corpus is large. While, for a small speech corpus, only a few bi-phoneme or tri-phoneme are found. Such a scalable base unit set makes it possible to achieve better smoothness in concatenation while maintain the naturalness of prosody. Evaluation results show that, after replacing the phone-sized base unit <b>set</b> with the <b>customized</b> <b>set,</b> the search speed is improved by 5 times and 59 % preference score is obtained. 1...|$|R

40|$|Decellularized tissues, native or engineered, are {{receiving}} increasing {{interest in the}} field of regenerative medicine as scaffolds or implants for tissue and organ repair. The approach, which offers the opportunity to deliver off-the-shelf bioactive materials without immuno-matching requirements, is based on the rationale that extracellular matrix (ECM) -presented cues can be potently instructive towards regeneration. However, existing decellularization protocols typically result in damage to the source ECM and do not allow the controlled preservation of its structural, biochemical and/or biomechanical features. Here we propose the deliberate activation of programmed cell death as a method to selectively target the cellular component of a tissue and thereby to preserve the integrity of the decellularized ECM. In the case of engineered tissues, the approach could be complemented by the use of (i) an immortalized cell line, engineered to undergo apoptosis upon exposure to a chemical inducer, and (ii) a perfusion bioreactor system, supporting efficient removal of cellular material.
