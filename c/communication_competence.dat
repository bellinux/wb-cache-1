In the following study we aimed to analyse {{for the first time}} the age differences in early <b>communication</b> <b>competences</b> of Slovenian infants and toddlers. The sample included 512 infants and toddlers, aged from 8 to 30 months; their <b>communication</b> <b>competences</b> were assessed with the Communicative Development Inventory: Words and Gestures and Communicative Development Inventory: Words and Sentences (Marjanovič Umek, Fekonja Peklaj, Sočan, and Komidar, 2011). The obtained results suggest that in the period between 8 and 30 months of age there are significant age differences within different areas of <b>communication</b> <b>competences</b> (e. g. communicative and symbolic gestures, vocabulary, length and grammatical complexity of sentences). In addition, we found moderate to high positive correlations between different areas of infants&# 39; and toddlers&# 39; <b>communication</b> <b>competences.</b> The analysis of the effect of gender on the <b>communication</b> <b>competences</b> of infants and toddlers showed that girls and boys aged 8 to 16 months did not differ significantly in their communicative competences.

It focuses on MFIs’ financial performance, and on the level of subsidies received. The results show that the management skills are associated to the financial performances. The technical, organisational and <b>communication</b> <b>competences</b> of the top managers seem to play a key role among the four management dimensions analysed by the rating agency. Furthermore, the level of subsidies granted has a very limited impact on management quality.

50|$|Communication can {{be defined}} as the {{exchange}} and negotiation of information between two or more individuals through verbal and nonverbal symbols, oral and written (or visual) modes, and the production and comprehension processes of communication. According to First International Congress for the Study of Child Language, “the general hypothesis that access to social interaction is a prerequisite to normal language acquisition”. Principles of conversation include two or more people focusing on one topic. All questions in a conversation should be answered, comments should be understood or acknowledged and any form of direction should, in theory, be followed. In the case of young, undeveloped children, these conversations are expected to be basic or redundant. The role of a guardians during developing stages is to convey that conversation is meant to have a purpose, as well as teaching them to recognize the other speaker’s emotions. Communicative language is nonverbal and/or verbal, and to achieve <b>communication</b> <b>competence,</b> four components must be met. These four components of <b>communication</b> <b>competence</b> include: grammatical competence (vocabulary knowledge, rules of word sentence formation, etc.), sociolinguistic competence (appropriateness of meanings and grammatical forms in different social contexts), discourse competence (knowledge required to combine forms and meanings), and strategic competence (knowledge of verbal and nonverbal communication strategies). The attainment of communicative competence {{is an essential part of}} actual communication.|$|E
50|$|Compulsive talking {{goes beyond}} the bounds of what is {{considered}} to be a socially acceptable amount of talking. The two main factors in determining if someone is a compulsive talker are talking in a continuous manner, only stopping when the other person starts talking, and others perceiving their talking as a problem. Personality traits that have been positively linked to this compulsion include assertiveness, willingness to communicate, self-perceived <b>communication</b> <b>competence,</b> and neuroticism. Studies have shown that most people who are talkaholics are aware of the amount of talking they do, are unable to stop, and do not see it as a problem.|$|E

Universal pragmatics, a term coined by Jürgen Habermas, suggests that human conflict arises from miscommunication, so communicative competence is needed to reduce conflict. <b>Communication</b> <b>competence</b> [...] "involves {{the ability to communicate}} in such a way that: (1) the truth claim of an utterance is shared by both speaker and hearer; (2) the hearer is led to understand and accept the speaker’s intention; and (3) the speaker adapts to the hearer’s world view."

Dr. Gwen Hullman used Message Design Logic {{to help in the}} study of perceptions of <b>communication</b> <b>competence.</b> The conclusion of her research in relation to message design was that, “speakers of rhetorical regulative messages were perceived as more effective, more appropriate, and were rated as more competent.” These findings reflect the ideas O’Keefe stated in her original work in that rhetorical speakers can better align their goals with their partner's goals.|$|E
