50|$|The crew {{required}} {{to operate a}} large or super-sized luxury yacht can number from 8 members for a 120 ft yacht, to a complement of 70 for a yacht the size of Eclipse. The crew {{is made up of}} a Captain, First Mate/Officer, Chief Engineer, Engineers, Bosun, Personal Chef, Crew Chef, Deckhands and Stewardess/Stewards. Luxury yachts are maintained by crew all year round but will often scale down to a skeleton crew during the seasons that the owners are not on board and no charters are booked. Most crew members live on board and are paid a monthly salary, with most living expenses covered by the owner. Live-on-board crews do not pay rent, food, electricity or water bills. All luxury yachts have crew areas below deck, which <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crew</b> mess, crew cabins and laundry. While most crew cabins contain bunk beds, there are Captains and Chief Engineers who, on the larger yachts, have their own cabins. There are no set hours that crew members work each week. The hours depend greatly on how often the owners are on board, how often it is chartered and on what hours the Captain sets when there are no guests on board. The crew can be hired through crew agencies or websites like Find a Crew.|$|E

With the necessary allowance of about 20 tons for the service load <b>consisting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> approximately 40, stores and water ballast this meant a possible fuel and passenger load of 42 tons. Accommodation for 100 passengers and tankage for 57 hours' flight was to be provided and a sustainable cruise speed of 63 mph and maximum speed of 70 mph was called for.

5000|$|The Spacecab {{spaceplane}} design concept <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large <b>crewed</b> [...] "carrier" [...] aircraft with {{a smaller}} [...] "orbiter" [...] attached on top, {{both of which are}} derived from Ascender.

It would be capable of delivering up to 750 kg to low earth orbit, and also transporting supplies and crew to the International Space Station, an increasingly important capability following the retirement of the Space Shuttle. Spacecab {{can be thought of as}} the intermediate next step in development between Ascender and Spacebus, and like Ascender it does not require any new technology or materials and has been the subject <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1994 feasibility study confirming this claim.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} NASA's Constellation {{project is to}} create the new {{generation}} of spacecraft for human flight to the International Space Station in low-earth orbit, the lunar surface, as well as for use in future deep-space exploration. One portion of the Constellation program was the development of the Orion crew exploration vehicle (CEV) to be used in spaceflight. The Orion spacecraft <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crew</b> module, service module, space adapter and launch abort system. The crew module was designed to hold as many as six crew members. The Orion crew exploration vehicle is similar in design to the Apollo space capsules, although larger and more massive. The Flight Test Office is the responsible flight test organization for the launch abort system on the Orion crew exploration vehicle. The Flight Test Office originally proposed six tests that would demonstrate the use of the launch abort system. These flight tests were to be performed at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and were similar in nature to the Apollo Little Joe II tests performed in the 1960 s. The first flight test of the launch abort system was a pad abort (PA- 1), that took place on 6 May 2010 at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Primary flight test objectives were to demonstrate the capability of the launch abort system to propel the <b>crew</b> module <b>a</b> safe distance away from a launch vehicle during a pad abort, to demonstrate the stability and control characteristics of the vehicle, and to determine the performance of the motors contained within the launch abort system. The focus of the PA- 1 flight test was engineering development and data acquisition, not certification. In this presentation, a high level overview of the PA- 1 vehicle is given, along with <b>an</b> overview <b>of</b> the Mobile Operations Facility and information on the White Sands tracking sites for radar & optics. Several lessons learned are presented, including detailed information on the lessons learned in the development of wind placards for flight. PA- 1 flight data is shown, as well as <b>a</b> comparison <b>of</b> PA- 1 flight data to nonlinear simulation Monte Carlo data...|$|R
40|$|A logical {{next step}} after shuttle is a manned orbital service system (MOSS) <b>consisting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> two-man <b>crew</b> module mated with a {{propulsion}} module. The resulting spacecraft {{would remain in}} low Earth orbit for months or years at a time conducting civil or military satellite servicing, experimental, or applications missions while being periodically supplied and refueled by Shuttle flights from the ground. The system would accumulate experience invaluable {{to the design of}} future large and more expensive spacecraft. Key features of the vehicle are versatility and mobility. With Centaur-type propulsion and a large payload, the MOSS could leave <b>an</b> initial orbit <b>of</b> 370 km (200 nmi) altitude and inclinations up to 56 deg, make <b>a</b> plane change <b>of</b> up to + or - 14 deg, reach altitudes to 5500 km (2970 nmi), and then return the payload to the original orbit altitude and inclination. Obviously, the size of the performance envelope varies with the payload and propulsion-unit selected. The MOSS can reach orbits and perform tasks not possible with Shuttle alone or with the much larger space stations currently being proposed...|$|R

40|$|What {{will happen}} after the International Space Station’s {{operational}} lifetime ends? How could <b>a</b> future <b>crewed</b> Low Earth Orbit (LEO) platform look like with the lessons learnt from the ISS experience in mind? How could a future role share be organized and what use cases and applications could a future platform offer? What is the longterm big picture for future human LEO activities? These questions are currently under {{investigation in the}} course of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) “Post-ISS” activities. A very promising answer is proposed by the Orbital Hub concept which has been developed by DLR’s System Analysis Space Segment department in Bremen together with scientists, international space industry and recently together with international institutions using DLR’s Concurrent Engineering Facility. The concept <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small modular <b>crewed</b> part called Base Platform and a dockable, serviceable, but uncrewed experiment platform referred to as Free Flyer. One major advantage <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> scenario is the decoupling of the habitat and the payload platform leading to higher flexibility, reduced attitude and pointing restrictions as well as less security concerns. The single modules of the Orbital Hub have been designed under the premise of modularity and each with their own dedicated functionalities and responsibilities. Therefore, they could also be used as building blocks for different platform concepts together with modules from other international partners and re-used ISS parts to serve for diverse mission objectives and political requirements. In the long-term, the DLR vision is to have the Orbital Hub as <b>a</b> central node <b>of</b> <b>a</b> platform cluster building up an environment for resource sharing, exchange and collaboration in LEO, referred to as “Space City”. The present paper gives an overview about the technical design, development progress and ongoing activities around this concept including e. g. joint studies with international partners. The paper assesses the possible combinations of the Orbital Hub modules together with both existing ISS parts and spacecraft under development or planned for the future. Furthermore, it offers an outlook on the role and opportunities of the Orbital Hub or similar platforms in the context of larger LEO formations for human space-flight...|$|R
