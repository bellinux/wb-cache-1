5000|$|The {{atypical}} facial processing {{style of}} people with ASD often manifests in constrained social ability, due to decreased eye <b>contact,</b> <b>joint</b> attention, interpretation of emotional expression, and communicative skills. These deficiencies {{can be seen in}} infants as young as 9 months; specifically in terms of poor eye contact and difficulties engaging in joint attention. [...] Some experts have even used the term 'face avoidance' to describe the phenomena where infants who are later diagnosed with ASD preferentially attend to non-face objects over faces. Furthermore, some have proposed that the demonstrated impairment in children with ASD's ability to grasp emotional content of faces is not a reflection of the incapacity to process emotional information, but rather, the result of a general inattentiveness to facial expression. The constraints of these processes that are essential to the development of communicative and social-cognitive abilities are viewed to be the cause of impaired social engagement and responsivity. Furthermore, research suggests that there exists a link between decreased face processing abilities in individuals with ASD and later deficits in Theory of Mind; for example, while typically developing individuals are able to relate others' emotional expressions to their actions, individuals with ASD do not demonstrate this skill to the same extent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Solder reflow {{connection}} of semiconductor devices to substrates {{has been shown}} to be a reliable, effective, and readily automated technique. Rigid copper spheres, which remain rigid during solder reflow, have been used successfully for some time a as major element of the <b>contact</b> <b>joint.</b> However, to expand the capability of such joints to larger devices such as multiple-transistor chips in hybrid components, ductile metallic joining pads can be used on the devices instead of the copper spheres to reduce mechanical strains and permit multi-pad devices to make proper contact to module lands during reflow. This paper describes a technique that prevents these solder pads from collapsing and permits large scale production. Termed “controlled collapse,” the method is based on limiting the solderable area of the substrate lands and chip contact terminals so that surface tension in the molten pad and land solder supports the device until the joint solidifies. The result is a sturdy, testable {{connection of}} high reliability (bond strength 30 - 50 gm, pilotproduction yields exceeding 97 %, predicted failure rate-based on laboratory tests-considerably lower than that of copper ball contacts).

40|$|The {{shoulder}} (glenohumeral) joint has {{the greatest}} range of motion of all human joints; as a result, it is particularly vulnerable to dislocation and injury. The ability to accurately measure dynamic in-vivo joint kinematics in 6 -Degrees-of-Freedom (6 -DOF) (translations and rotations) and subsequently quantify articular cartilage contact patterns of that joint has been and remains a difficult biomechanics problem. As a result, {{little is known about}} normal in-vivo glenohumeral <b>joint</b> <b>contact</b> patterns or the consequences of surgery on: shoulder joint kinematics, the soft tissue anatomy around the shoulder, and glenohumeral <b>joint</b> <b>contact</b> patterns. Additionally, the effect of quantifying glenohumeral <b>joint</b> <b>contact</b> patterns by means of proximity mapping, both with and without cartilage data is unknown. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis are to (1) describe and validate a noninvasive Dual Fluoroscopic Imaging System (DFIS) to measure dynamic shoulder joint motion; (2) describe a technique to quantify in-vivo glenohumeral <b>joint</b> <b>contact</b> patterns from the measured shoulder motion; (3) quantify normal glenohumeral <b>joint</b> <b>contact</b> patterns in the young healthy adult; (4) compare glenohumeral <b>joint</b> <b>contact</b> patterns determined both with and without articular cartilage data; and (5) demonstrate that the DFIS technique can evaluate the dynamic suprascapular nerve (a soft tissue around the shoulder) anatomy in 6 -DOF in a proof of concept cadaveric model. Our results show that for the shoulder motion tested, glenohumeral <b>joint</b> <b>contact</b> was located on the anterior-inferior glenoid surface, and that the inclusion of articular cartilage data when quantifying in-vivo glenohumeral <b>joint</b> <b>contact</b> patterns has significant effects on the contact centroid location, the contact centroid range of travel, and the total contact path length. As a result, our technique offers an advantage over glenohumeral <b>joint</b> <b>contact</b> pattern measurement techniques that neglect articular cartilage data. Likewise, this technique may be more sensitive than traditional 6 -DOF joint kinematics for the assessment of overall glenohumeral joint health. Lastly, in the proof of concept cadaveric model, we demonstrated that the DFIS technique can evaluate the dynamic suprascapular nerve anatomy in 6 -DOF and that the anatomical course of the nerve may be altered by a rotator cuff tendon tear and subsequent to surgical intervention. by Daniel Frank Massimini.

At the mesoscopic level {{the interaction between the}} units is simulated by means of specific mechanical devices such as the zero thickness interface model where the contact tractions and the displacement discontinuities are the primary static and kinematic variables respectively. In many cases the joint response depends also on internal stresses and strains within the interface layer adjacent to the joint interfaces. The introduction of internal stresses and strains leads to the formulation of the interphase model, a sort of enhanced zerothickness interface. With the term interphase we shall mean a layer separated by two physical interfaces from the bulk material or a multilayer structure with varying properties and several interfaces. Adopting the interphase concept, different failure conditions can be introduced for the physical interfaces and for the joint material. In the present work the interphase constitutive laws, taking into account the joint stiffness degradation and the onset of irreversible displacements, are derived in a thermodynamically consistent manner assuming an appropriate form of the Helmholtz free energy, function of the internal and <b>contact</b> <b>joint</b> strains and of other internal variables which regulate the evolution of the non-linear phenomena.

It is question to simulate the movement of a desmodromic robot which moves in an environment represented by a 3 D surface. The robot has a mechano-hydraulic system which is able to modify the geometry of chassis in the aim of maintaining the platform always at horizontal while in movement, no matter the soil configuration (of course between some limits). The horizontalisation mechanism with the rolling train hydraulically driven presents some difficulties because of the non holonomic constraints of the wheels ([1, 2]). In order to make the application of the multipoles theory in the structomatical model must be introduce some simplifications in the <b>contact</b> <b>joint.</b> Thus, the non holonomic joints are presented like gamma active joints (with the condition of controlled rolling/skidding). This is an extension of the general principle of mechanism formation ([3]) according who any mechanical structure can be broken in genes upon an unique formula (the genetic code of the mechanism). Because of the complexity of the calculus the study of mechanism was divided in a few chapters: geometrics, structomatics, kinematics, kinetostatics and dynamics etc. The uttermost important and difficult part is the kinematical model because of the non-linearity of the equations.
