Drawing on case studies from the United States, the article suggests that the automated communications enabled by smart grid technologies significantly benefit each dimension of the energy trilemma: economic, social and environmental. However, successful smart grid implementation requires smart communication beyond technology.

40|$|In the mid- 1980 s, <b>customers</b> <b>threatened</b> {{to bypass}} local gas {{distribution}} companies {{in favor of}} other suppliers and cheaper fuels. In response, states began to reform their natural gas regulatory policies to lower delivered prices to potential bypassers. In this Article, Professor Kelly argues that the most promising means of reform is to unbundle traditional local gas utility services, that is, to make gas transportation services available to customers separately from gas retail sales services. This Article provides a thorough analysis of the unbundling policies adopted by state regulators across the nation. Through this systematic review of intrastate regulatory policies, Professor Kelly outlines the best method of maintaining open access to markets, of retaining sufficient regulatory control over local utility companies, and of maximizing competition and minimizing the adverse effects of cost-shifting and stranded investment. Professor Kelly asserts that regulatory bodies must recognize the competitive character of unbundled gas retailing service and the monopolistic nature of both unbundled gas transportation services and the services that remain bundled, {{in order to promote}} most effectively the primary goal of unbundling: prevention of uneconomic bypass by providing market-priced natural gas to end users...|$|R

Midsourcing is a modification to the trend in high technology of outsourcing jobs directly to lower cost labor markets in places like the Indian subcontinent, China, and Eastern Europe. By acting as a middle layer between the customer (usually in the U.S.) and the offshore firm, the midsourcing company offers quality control and management oversight of the offshored project, and closes gaps in translation and communication.

After the machines were recalled and repaired, Federal Electric doubled the order. They remained a customer for three years, when they began to produce their own washers.

Sears began selling two types of Upton wringer washers under the [...] "Allen" [...] brand, one for $54.75 and a deluxe model for $95. Sales grew quickly and in 1921, Sears appointed Upton as their sole supplier of washers. To avoid becoming over-reliant on Sears, Upton began marketing a washer under their own brand name.|$|R

40|$|MIng (Computer and Electronic Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{opinion of}} {{customers}} about companies {{are very important}} as this can influence a company’s profit. Companies often get customer feedback via surveys or other official methods {{in order to improve}} their services. However, some <b>customers</b> feel <b>threatened</b> when their opinions are publicly asked and thus prefer to voice their opinion on the internet where they take comfort in anonymity. This form of customer feedback is difficult to monitor as the information can be found anywhere on the internet and new information is generated at an astonishing rate. Currently there are companies such as Brandseye and Brand. Com that provide online reputation management services. These services have various shortcomings such as cost and is incapable of accessing historical data. Companies are also not allowed to purchase these software and can only use the software on a subscription basis. The design proposed in this document will be able to scan any number of user defined websites and save all the information found on the websites in a series of index files, which can be queried for occurrences of user defined keywords at any time. Additionally, the software will also be able to scan Twitter and Facebook for any number of user defined keywords and save any occurrences of the keywords to a database. After scanning the internet, the results will be passed through a similarity filter, which will filter out insignificant results as well as any duplicates that might be present. Once passed through the filter the remaining results will be analysed by a sentiment analysis tool which will determine whether the sentence in which the keyword occurs is positive or negative. The analysed results will determine the overall reputation of the keyword that was used. The proposed design has several advantages over current systems: - By using the modular design several tasks can execute at the same time without influencingeach other. For example; information can be extracted from the internet while existing resultsare being analysed. - By providing the keywords and websites that the system will use the user will have full controlover the online reputation management process. - By saving all the information contained in a website the user {{will be able to take}} historicalinformation into account to determine how the keywords reputation changes over time. Savingthe information will also allow the user to search for any keyword without rescanning theinternet.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 Customer defections {{have been}} linked to service {{encounter}} failure in the tourism, leisure and hospitality industry. This study embraces the idea of improving customer acquisition, retention and satisfaction through proactively promoting operational excellence and improved customer service strategies. Mkambati Nature Reserve is studied to evaluate its customer service levels and to lay the foundation for the development of strategies for customer service improvement. Located in rural Transkei (Eastern Cape) wild coast, the resort is trying to position itself as a world-class holiday destination. However, increasing competition and the changing needs of its <b>customers</b> are <b>threatening</b> to erode its market share. The challenge for management is how to grow its market through customer acquisition and retention. This customer service measurement survey is one of regular surveys meant to evaluate the levels of customer service at Mkambati. A research questionnaire was designed to establish the profile of the visitors, their impression of the levels of service they receive and the key attractions. The respondents were also required to give a general opinion of the service they received and any other factors of concern. The data collected has been used to test the proposition: Customers are satisfied with the level of customer service received at the game reserve, i. e. at reservations, arrival, game drives, with accommodation, at the beach, restaurant and bar, cultural village, and at departure. A literature review of customer service in the tourism, leisure and hospitality industry has been under taken. The unique features of customer service in the tourism and leisure industry emerged. These are variability, perishability, intangibility and inseparability. It also emerged that there are 10 dimensions of service quality i. e. reliability, responsiveness, competence, access, courtesy, communication, credibility, security, understanding and reliability. However, they have been reduced to the five dimensions of service quality i. e. reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy and tangibles. The SERVQUAL instrument has been used to analyse data relating to customer perceptions at Mkambati Nature Reserve. The population of the research study consists of the residents and tourists in South Africa and the respondents were selected using a simple random sampling technique. A total of 300 questionnaires were issued and 270 were returned resulting in a 90 % response rate. Mathematical and statistical data treatments have been employed to evaluate the survey results. Data has been presented using tables and graphs. The research results were analysed using the computer software, Microsoft Excel and a statistical software package: Statistica. The statements in the questionnaire have been reduced to the five dimensions of customer service. It emerged that responsiveness has the highest rating of all service dimensions, followed by reliability, assurance, empathy. The least rating was for tangibles. The mean score and standard deviation stands at 60. 3 % and 5. 9 % respectively. The results of the survey revealed that the visitors are satisfied with the level of service they receive at reservations. At arrival, game drives, beach facilities, restaurant and bar, cultural village and departure there is moderate satisfaction. With an average score of 12 points, accommodation has the least service satisfaction. Thus its performance is below the expectations of the visitors. Therefore, the general conclusion is that the customers are moderately satisfied with the levels of customer service they receive at the resort. Based on the research findings, management could develop proactive strategies to improve customer service, enhance customer acquisition and retention and reduce customer defection. There is need to focus on the measures that improve operational excellence. The measures recommended include the use of information technology, development of organisational service standards (benchmarks), generate positive emotions in the service encounter, measurement and management of customer satisfaction and service quality, prioritize accommodation improvement, process improvement, service customization, improvement of the beach facilities and employee empowerment.
