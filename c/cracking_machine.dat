40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{impinging}} velocitythat gives that maximum cracking {{efficiency of}} a vertical shaft centrifugal palm nut <b>cracking</b> <b>machine</b> was determined in this study. A nut cracking energy instrument {{which consists of}} a hammering mass falling vertically on palm nuts placed on a base {{was used to determine}} potential energy required to crack the nuts. This energy was equated to the kinetic energy required to crack the nuts in a centrifugal palm nut <b>cracking</b> <b>machine,</b> from which the average impinging velocity was determined. Experiment was carried out to generate cracking energy data for both Dura and Tenera varieties of palm nuts available in the study area. For Dura type, highest percentage of fully cracked (FC) nuts and average impinging velocity of 32. 50 m/s were obtained when the height of the hammering mass was set at 0. 15 m, 0. 25 m and 0. 30 m for nuts sorted into diameter ranges of d < 15 mm, 15 mm ≤ d ≤ 18 mm, and 18 mm ≤ d ≤ 22 mm respectively. For the Tenera type, highest percentage of fully cracked (FC) nuts and average impinging velocity of 39. 56 m/s were obtained when the height of the hammering mass was set at 0. 09 m, 0. 10 m and 0. 13 m for nuts sorted into diameter ranges of 9 mm <d < 13 mm, 13 mm ≤ d ≤ 15 mm, and 15 mm ≤ d ≤ 20 mm respectively. The overall average impinging velocity of 36 m/s was obtained for both varieties of palm nut and which was used in the design and construction of a centrifugal palm nut cracker.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thevetia seed {{contains}} about 64 percent of non-edible oil in its oily kernel and this oil {{can be used}} for various purposes such as biofuel and bio-oil; making of paints, insecticides, cosmetics, lubricants and cooling oil in electrical transformers. The cakes obtained after oil extraction are incorporated on the field as manure. In order to get quality oil kernels from the hard nuts, there is need to properly crack them; this process of cracking is still a great challenge. As result of the aforementioned problem, this work focused on the design, fabrication and performance evaluation of a thevetia nut <b>cracking</b> <b>machine.</b> The machine works based on the principle of attrition force. Some of the parts designed for were diameter of shaft (13 mm solid shaft) and length of belt (A 55), power required to operate the machine (2. 5 hp), speed of operation (9. 14 m/s) and the appropriate dimension of angle iron bar of 45 mm × 45 mm × 3 mm was used for the structural support. The fabrication was done systematically followed by the performance evaluation of the machine.

To make sure the rate of dependence hundred percent on uses of fossil fuel will reduce in human life, rubber seed oil (RSO) is seeing as good of alternative in context of biodiesel fuel. The purpose this review is to evaluate the potential of rubber seed oil as replacement or as substance that can mix with diesel fuel to increase the impact of human life. This review is focusing on the processing of production biodiesel from RSO and evaluate the beneficial of RSO. In addition, it also review the challenges on uses of RSO as biodiesel in Malaysia. The process of RSO is started where the rubber seed that collected from field needed to separate the kernels from shells using the <b>cracking</b> <b>machine</b> and produce the oil through oil extraction. During the trans-esterification process, RSO need use the acid and base/alkali catalyzed to reduce the higher FFA content and separate methyl ester from the water content using methanol. After that, the oil must pass through the filtering process to remove impurities and lastly, oil will dry through drying process before saving in the tank. The RSO actually give beneficial on environmental impact and human life because this types of biodiesel is a 'greener' energy where it is nontoxic, better quality exhaust gases, biodegradability and renewability of resources. However, application RSO as biodiesel have challenges because Malaysia facing problem to get new technology for production biodiesel diesel from RSO in large scales.

Usually, {{in order to obtain}} reliable values of stress intensity factors, it is necessary to realize three-dimensional meshes or to utilize the energy approach. An alternative, simplified and approximate approach is proposed here. It is based on the construction of simple two-dimensional models to obtain accurate values of the geometry factors of the component at the deepest point of the crack. Experimental tests show that the relation between the depth and the length of the crack on the free surface is linear. Hence it is possible to reduce the problem to two dimensions with a consequent saving of calculation time.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of the moisture content, loading velocity and compression position on the force, specific deformation, absorbed energy and required power to achieve the initial rupture of the walnut shell. Iran is the third walnut producing country in the world. Separation of walnut kernel from the shell is a very time consuming and costly task. A proper <b>cracking</b> <b>machine</b> for walnut has not yet been manufactured. It seems that the determination of mechanical properties of different walnut varieties is the pre-requisite step for this purpose. Thus, 108 local walnut samples, (a local cultivar) obtained from the seedling trees of Urmia district, with almost equal dimensions were selected. These samples were compression loaded by an Instron test machine until the shell rupture was initiated. During this experiment, rupture force, specific deformation, required energy and power for shell rupture, in 9, 21 and 27 % (w. b.) walnut moisture levels, 50, 200 and 500 mm min - 1 loading velocities and at 3 major compression directions namely, length (X), suture (Z) and width (Y), were determined. The results of this experiment indicated that, the highest force, energy and power values, required for walnut rupture, occur when the force is applied at the length direction of the fruit and the lowest of these values were required at either width or suture line. Specific deformation of walnut shell increased with increasing loading velocity, regardless of its moisture content and loading direction. Furthermore, moisture content of walnut shell increased the specific deformation for 21 % moisture, but did not cause further changes at the higher level of 27 % of moisture. However, the strain values (specific deformation) appeared to be the same at all loading position. Increasing the loading velocity, although increased the required rupture energy and power, but reduced the fracture force. Furthermore, in higher loading velocities (about 500 mm min - 1), the specific deformation increased which indicates more flexibility in walnut shell. Flexible shell may protect the fruit against fracture in the walnut cracking process...|$|E

Dates: 15 ? 16 May 2012 This {{research focuses on}} developing the entrepreneurial skills and capacities of the marginalised and disadvantaged groups (especially women and orphans) in countryside communities. It seeks to promote the development of sustainable community-based natural product enterprises and to provide guidance in developing and implementing programmes on developing entrepreneurship skills and culture at the community level by providing mechanisation technology for cracking Marula fruit nuts. The researchers seek to develop {{the concept of a}} Community-Based Enterprise (CBE), maintaining that it provides a potential strategy for sustainable local development. The research established that most people in rural areas depend on the forest and on other natural resources for their daily livelihoods. However, they generally use these resources in a subsistence mode, and hardly harness the optimum potential of the resource nor do they generate a good income and secure employment for themselves. Such a subsistence approach to using the products of natural resources is an attributed factor for the continuation of rural poverty and the degradation of the resource base. There is little incentive for these people to conserve and manage the resources. This led to the researchers? focus on the establishment of Marula natural products enterprises development as a basis for the generation of income and employment for local people, and the sustainable management of natural resources. Research has shown that the poorest communities need entrepreneurship skills to enable them to establish and develop sustainable natural product enterprises. Entrepreneurship development provides the natural resources-dependent communities with the skills and competencies necessary to address enterprise 67 challenges, and to tap into the opportunities in the long run through initiating enterprises with or without external support. Researchers have established that little work in Zimbabwe has been done to increase the rate of production in Marula nut cracking. The methodology used included conducting a survey and participatory workshops in the two zoom sites of Masendu and Chivi to establish the feasibility of using the Marula tree and fruit as the focal economic driver. The workshops provided pertinent information which will be vital in generating the Marula nut <b>cracking</b> <b>machine</b> design as a platform to fostering entrepreneurship for economic sustainability in the communities...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} study {{for evaluation of}} TOFD technique for determination of size of the embedded subcladding cracks. It extends the results presented in the previous papers (1, 2). The study was confined to simulated <b>cracks</b> (<b>machined</b> slits) underneath the cladding. Crack heights ranging from 1. 68 mm to 19. 04 mm underneath Stainless Steel, Inconel and Ferritic cladding could be sized with an accuracy of ± 0. 2 mm. Difficulty was experienced using TOFD to size cracks starting from the interface between Inconel /Stainless Steel cladding and the ferritic base i. e. (5 mm/ 6 mm below the scanning surface). However, these cracks could be well detected and sized by scanning through the cladding from the opposite surface of the blocks. Even the small cracks {{of the order of}} 1. 9 mm could be detected {{as long as they are}} not influenced by the lateral wave. Experimental errors are presented. Introduction: In case of the welded structures, embedded vertical cracks are very often encountered necessitating reliable procedure for determining their size.

40|$|Machining {{damage to}} {{structural}} ceramics is complex; a single <b>machining</b> <b>crack</b> {{consists of a}} series of continuous and overlapping semielliptical surface flaws between about 10 and 100 μm deep, as shown schematically in Fig, 1 a. The mouths of these flaws are held closed by a layer of compressive residual stresses induced by the irreversible plastic deformations and material removal occuring during machining. Beneath the compressive layer is a zone of weak tension which separates the subsurface portions of the flaw faces. These residual stress fields permit stable crack growth to about 4. 5 times the initial flaw depth prior to fracture, and are responsible for as much as a 40 % reduction in material strength.
