25|$|De Rothschild and his {{sophisticated}} Viennese {{wife were}} {{at the center of}} Parisian culture. The chef for their lavish receptions was Antonin Carême. They patronized major personalities in the arts, including Gioacchino Rossini, Frédéric Chopin, Honoré de Balzac, Eugène Delacroix, and Heinrich Heine. As an acknowledgment of the many years of patronage extended by Baron James and his wife Betty, in 1847 Chopin dedicated his Valse Op. 64, N° 2 in <b>C</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>minor</b> to their daughter Charlotte. In 1848 Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres painted Betty de Rothschild's portrait.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{large-scale}} work in five movements forming an arch shape– a central scherzo of some 800 bars is framed by two slow movements, which themselves are framed by two outer fast movements. The arch shape is completed by a slow introduction and a slow coda. The entire {{basis of the}} material for the work is outlined in the opening introduction, with the main theme having some sort of parallel with Beethoven's <b>C</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>minor</b> quartet. It is one of Simpson's more subtle and enigmatic scores, with an epilogue of almost naive, diatonic fluidity and rising scales.|$|E
500|$|In 1921, the eighteen-year-old Khachaturian {{moved to}} Moscow {{to join his}} oldest brother, Suren, who had settled in Moscow earlier and was a stage {{director}} at the Moscow Art Theatre {{by the time of}} his arrival. [...] He enrolled at the Gnessin Musical Institute in 1922, simultaneously studying biology at the Moscow University. He initially studied the cello under Sergei Bychkov and later under Andrey Borysyak. In 1925, Mikhail Gnessin started a composition class at the institute, which Khachaturian joined. He also took lessons from Reinhold Glière. In this period, he wrote his first works: the Dance Suite for violin and piano (1926) and the Poem in <b>C</b> <b>Sharp</b> <b>Minor</b> (1927). Beginning with his earliest works, Khachaturian extensively used Armenian folk music in his compositions.|$|E

500|$|In general, Sullivan {{preferred}} {{to write in}} major keys. In the Savoy operas, there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key (less than 5% of the musical numbers), and even in his serious works the major prevails. Examples of Sullivan's rare excursions into minor keys include the long E minor melody in the first movement of the Irish Symphony, [...] "Go away, madam" [...] in the Act I finale of Iolanthe (echoing Verdi and Beethoven) and the funeral march in the Act I finale of The Yeomen of the Guard. Sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect. When reproached for using consecutive fifths in Cox and Box, he replied [...] "if 5ths turn up it doesn't matter, {{so long as there}} is no offence to the ear." [...] Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan's characteristic modulation between keys, as in [...] "Expressive glances" [...] (Princess Ida), where he smoothly negotiates E major, <b>C</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>minor</b> and C major, or [...] "Then one of us will be a queen" [...] (The Gondoliers), where he writes in F major, D flat major and D minor.|$|E
500|$|The sixth nocturne, {{dedicated}} to Eugène d'Eichthal, is widely {{held to be}} one of the finest of the series. Cortot said, [...] "There are few pages in all music comparable to these." [...] Morrison calls it [...] "among the most rich and eloquent of all Fauré's piano works." [...] The pianist and writer Nancy Bricard calls it [...] "one of the most passionate and moving works in piano literature." [...] Fauré wrote it after a six-year break from composing for the piano. The piece begins with an emotional, outpouring phrase, with echoes of Fauré's song cycle [...] La bonne chanson. The second theme, at first seemingly tranquil, has what the composer Charles Koechlin calls a persistent inquietude, emphasised by the syncopated accompaniment. The initial theme returns, and is followed by a substantial development of a gentle, contemplative melody. A recapitulation of the principal theme takes the piece to its conclusion. Copland wrote that it was with this work that Fauré first fully emerged from the shadow of Chopin, and he said of the piece, [...] "The breath and dignity of the opening melody, the restless <b>C</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>minor</b> section which follows (with the peculiar syncopated harmonies so often and so well used by Fauré), the graceful fluidity of the third idea: all these elements are brought to a stormy climax in the short development section; then, after a pause, comes the return of the consoling first page." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pianist Emil Breslauer of the 19th {{century was}} the first to draw {{attention}} to the similarity of these strains with the first five bars of the sixth movement of Beethoven's <b>C</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>minor</b> quartet, op. 131, [...] "adagio quasi un poco andante".|$|E

2500|$|Fugal {{passages}} {{are also}} found in the Missa Solemnis and all movements of the Ninth Symphony, except the third one. A massive, dissonant fugue forms the finale of his String Quartet, Op. 130 (1825); the latter was later published separately as Op. 133, the Große Fuge ("Great Fugue"). However, it is the fugue that opens Beethoven's String Quartet in <b>C</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>minor,</b> Op. 131 that several commentators regard as one of the composer's greatest achievements. [...] Joseph Kerman (1966, p.330) calls it [...] "this most moving of all fugues". Sullivan (1927, p.235) hears it as [...] "the most superhuman piece of music that Beethoven has ever written." [...] Philip Radcliffe (1965, p.149) says [...] "A bare description of its formal outline can give but little idea of the extraordinary profundity of this fugue [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Author Simon Leng {{describes}} the melody of [...] "Beware of Darkness" [...] as [...] "complex and highly original". The melody of the verses incorporates a pedal {{point on the}} key of G major and moves to G sharp minor, a progression Leng claims [...] "should not work in harmonic terms", using as an analogy a count of [...] "one, two, six", but notes that somehow the melody manages to work. Music professor Wilfrid Mellers explains {{the effectiveness of this}} key shift as dramatising the [...] "beware" [...] in the lyrics. Similarly, Mellers claims that harmonic movement from the key of <b>C</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>minor</b> to D major to C major [...] "creates the 'aimless' wandering of 'each unconscious sufferer'" [...] described in the lyrics. The nearly chromatic melody of the verses contrasts with a more standard rock melody in the middle eight. The musicians on the recording include Harrison, Eric Clapton and Dave Mason on guitar, Carl Radle on bass guitar, Bobby Whitlock on piano, Gary Wright on organ and Ringo Starr on drums.|$|E
