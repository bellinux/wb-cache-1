5|$|There <b>could</b> <b>conceivably</b> {{be other}} planets {{in the system}} that do not transit the star, but they would only be {{detectable}} by the effects of their gravity on {{the motion of the}} visible planets (much as how Neptune was discovered).|$|E
5|$|The {{cloud cover}} {{is such that}} typical surface light levels are similar to a partly cloudy day on Earth, around 5000–10000 lux. The {{equivalent}} visibility is about three kilometers, but this will likely vary with the wind conditions. Little to no solar energy <b>could</b> <b>conceivably</b> be collected by solar panels on a surface probe. In fact, due to the thick, highly reflective cloud cover, the total solar energy received by {{the surface of the}} planet is less than that of the Earth.|$|E
5|$|First on the {{schedule}} were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas {{on the site of}} a derelict hotel which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with in 1977 during the filming of The Spy Who Loved Me. In the scene, Bond drives a digger toward the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger <b>could</b> <b>conceivably</b> take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.|$|E
50|$|Braunbehrens {{and other}} {{scholars}} infer that Mozart <b>could</b> not <b>conceivably</b> have opened a movement with a completely unadorned melody line, and instead improvised a suitable accompaniment {{for the left}} hand. Similar passages occur throughout the concerto.|$|R
5|$|Juan de Mariana also relates {{that the}} English Earl of Derby and Earl of Salisbury had both {{participated in the}} siege of Algeciras, and they <b>could</b> have <b>conceivably</b> {{transferred}} the knowledge {{about the effectiveness of}} cannon to England.|$|R
5000|$|After December 2006, {{with the}} merger of Boeing and Lockheed-Martin space {{operations}} into United Launch Alliance, the Atlas V program [...] "gained access" [...] to the tooling and processes for 5-meter-diameter stages, used on Delta IV. At 5-meter-diameter, a stage <b>could</b> have <b>conceivably</b> accepted dual RD-180 engines.|$|R
5|$|Pennatomys nivalis is an extinct oryzomyine rodent {{from the}} islands of Sint Eustatius, Saint Kitts, and Nevis in the Lesser Antilles. The only species in the genus Pennatomys, it is known from {{skeletal}} remains found in Amerindian archeological sites on all three islands, with dates ranging from 790–520 BCE to 900–1200 CE. No live specimens are known, but there are several historical records of rodents from Saint Kitts and Nevis that <b>could</b> <b>conceivably</b> refer to Pennatomys. The animal apparently belongs to a group within the tribe Oryzomyini that includes many other island-dwelling species.|$|E
5|$|Quadruple-doubles {{have only}} been {{possible}} since the 1973–74 season, when the NBA started recording both blocked shots and steals. It is often speculated by observers that other all-time greats, namely Oscar Robertson (all time triple-doubles leader with 181), Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and Jerry West <b>could</b> <b>conceivably</b> have had quadruple-doubles. West's biography at NBA.com claims that he once recorded an unofficial quadruple-double with 44points, 12rebounds, 10assists and 10blocks. A biography of Wilt Chamberlain claims that he also recorded an unofficial quadruple-double in Game1 of the 1967 Eastern Division Finals against the Boston Celtics, when he had 24points, 32rebounds, 13assists and 12blocks.|$|E
5|$|Strangelets {{are small}} {{fragments}} of strange matter—a hypothetical form of quark matter—that contain roughly {{equal numbers of}} up, down, and strange quarks and that are more stable than ordinary nuclei (strangelets would {{range in size from}} a few femtometers to a few meters across). If strangelets can actually exist, and if they were produced at the LHC, they <b>could</b> <b>conceivably</b> initiate a runaway fusion process in which all the nuclei in the planet would be converted to strange matter, similar to a strange star.|$|E
50|$|Fourth-century Church Father Augustine of Hippo {{taught that}} God grants those whom he chooses for {{salvation}} {{the gift of}} persevering grace, and that they <b>could</b> not <b>conceivably</b> fall away. This doctrine {{gave rise to the}} doctrine of irresistible grace (gratia irresistibilis), though the term was not used during Augustine's lifetime.|$|R
50|$|Monophony <b>could</b> also <b>conceivably</b> {{include more}} than one voice which do not sing in unison but whose pitches move in parallel, always {{maintaining}} the same interval of an octave. A pair of notes sung one or a multiple of an octave apart are almost in unison, due to octave equivalency.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{virtually}} every other form of Federation technology, Universal Translators almost never break down. Although they were clearly in widespread use during Captain Kirk’s time (inasmuch as the crew regularly communicated with species who <b>could</b> not <b>conceivably</b> have knowledge of Standard English), it is unclear where they were carried on personnel of that era.|$|R
5|$|Although M-n {{outside of}} Michigan <b>could</b> <b>conceivably</b> refer to other state, provincial, local, or {{national}} highways, local usage {{in those areas}} does not mimic the Michigan usage in most cases. In countries like the United Kingdom, M refers to motorways, analogous to freeways in the United States, whereas M-numbered designations in Michigan simply indicate state trunklines in general and may exist on any type of highway. M-numbered trunklines are designated along a variety of roads, including eight-lane freeways in urban areas, four-lane rural freeways and expressways, principal arterial highways, and two-lane highways in remote rural areas. The system also includes M-185 on Mackinac Island, a non-motorized road restricted to bicycles, horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to {{synthesize}} elements 119 and 120 push {{the limits of}} current technology, due to the decreasing cross sections of the production reactions and their probably short half-lives, expected {{to be on the}} order of microseconds. Heavier elements, beginning with element 121, would likely be too short-lived to be detected with current technology, decaying within a microsecond before reaching the detectors. Where this one-microsecond border of half-lives lies is not known, and this may allow the synthesis of elements 121 through 124, with the exact limit depending on the model chosen for predicting nuclide masses. The nuclides 296Uue, 296,299Ubn, 300Ubu, 300,303Ubb, 304Ubt, and 304Ubq, continuing up a possible narrow one-microsecond alpha-decaying corridor, <b>could</b> <b>conceivably</b> be produced in the reactions of projectiles of 50Ti, 54Cr, and 58Fe with targets of 248Cm, 249Bk, and 249Cf.|$|E
5|$|Europa has the smoothest {{surface of}} any known solid {{object in the}} Solar System. The {{apparent}} youth and smoothness of the surface {{have led to the}} hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which <b>could</b> <b>conceivably</b> harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers.|$|E
5000|$|The masterplanners {{recognised}} [...] "a {{real opportunity}} {{to create a new}} high density urban quarter over the next decade, served as it is by Acton Town underground station on the Piccadilly line and South Acton on the north London line." [...] South Acton has a high PTAL rating, meaning that density <b>could</b> be <b>conceivably</b> double from the 2000 units, to near 3500 units.|$|R
5000|$|... 1938 Hyde {{charged that}} the {{telephone}} in his office had been tapped, probably by the Police Department, and {{he asked for a}} grand jury investigation. According to a subsequent letter from Mayor Frank L. Shaw, a City Hall investigation found that [...] "Councilman Hyde's telephone has not been tapped and <b>could</b> not <b>conceivably</b> have been tapped," [...] and Shaw charged Hyde with [...] "behavior unbecoming an official of this city." ...|$|R

5|$|It has {{a smooth}} and bright surface, {{with a layer}} of water {{surrounding}} the mantle of the planet, thought to be 100 kilometers thick. The smooth surface includes a layer of ice, while the bottom of the ice is theorized to be liquid water. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which <b>could</b> <b>conceivably</b> serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity. Life may exist in Europa's under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok. Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to microbial life on Earth in the deep ocean. So far, {{there is no evidence that}} life exists on Europa, but the likely presence of liquid water has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent to its {{discovery}} at the Mikea Forest, Petter's big-footed mouse {{was also}} found as a subfossil in cave deposits at Andrahomana in far southeastern Madagascar, a find reported in 2006. There, it was found together with more abundant remains of the introduced black rat and house mouse (Mus musculus), as well as indigenous rodents such as the bastard big-footed mouse. Two Petter's big-footed mouse bones were radiocarbon dated to 790–410BCE and 150–390CE, respectively, a period when the local climate became drier and humans first appeared. Macrotarsomys species are thought to burrow in sandy ground {{and would not be}} expected to enter caves; therefore, the subfossils are probably remains of animals eaten by birds of prey. Although Petter's big-footed mouse <b>could</b> <b>conceivably</b> persist in remnant pockets of wet habitat in southeastern Madagascar, searches at two sites near Andrahomana failed to confirm its presence. It may have become locally extinct in the area because of the drying climate and competition with the black rat.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{tenure at}} the aerodrome began ominously. The same day he was granted a request to travel as an {{observer}} in a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2, disaster struck which <b>could</b> <b>conceivably</b> have ended his career. Instructed to familiarise himself with the aircraft around the airfield he examined a Caudron Type A, and proceeded {{to turn over the}} engine. The aircraft was listed as unserviceable and McCudden saw no danger in leaving the throttle fully open. Suddenly the engine started and it accelerated out of the hangar and into a Farman MF.11. McCudden watched as the propeller chewed the wing to pieces and damaged his Commanding Officer's car which had been parked nearby. He was able to reach the cockpit and switch off the ignition but not before extensive damage had been done. For this misdemeanor he was brought before Colonel Frederick Sykes, commanding the RFC Military Wing. Sykes was pleased with his overall progress, which likely saved him, but sentenced McCudden to seven days detention and a forfeiture of 14 days pay for the incident. Five years later Sykes again met McCudden—then {{at the height of his}} fame—and chaffed him on the episode, even jokingly threatening to send him a bill for the car.|$|E

50|$|A route {{put forward}} by G Remington was {{proposed}} to run from Edinburgh through Lauder, Kelso, Wooler and Morpeth to Newcastle; the line was to use the Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway, a horse-drawn line using stone block sleepers, for access to Edinburgh. A Government commission, the so-called Smith-Barlow Commission, examined this and numerous other routes, but Remington had not prepared estimates of cost for his line; it was said to require works of a most formidable character, and would cost {{so much that it}} <b>could</b> not <b>conceivably</b> pay.

50|$|The {{scene in}} which Utah jumps after Bodhi without a {{parachute}} was ranked seventh in Empire magazine's Top 10 Crazy Action Sequences. The scene was also tested by the Discovery Channel series MythBusters. It was determined that Utah and Bodhi {{would not have been}} able to free-fall for 90 seconds (as in the film), nor would they have been able to hold a conversation in mid-air.
