5000|$|For most tenants and sharecroppers the AAA {{was a major}} help. Frey and Smith concluded, [...] "To {{the extent}} that the AAA control-program has been {{responsible}} for the increased price cotton, we conclude that it has increased the amount of goods and services consumed by the cotton tenants and <b>croppers</b> area." [...] Furthermore, the landowners typically let the tenants and <b>croppers</b> use the land taken out of cotton production for their own personal use in growing food and feed crops, which further increased their standard of living. Another consequence was that the historic high levels of turnover from year to year declined sharply, as tenants and <b>croppers</b> tend to stay with the same landowner.
