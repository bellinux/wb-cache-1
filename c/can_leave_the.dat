5|$|The {{left and}} right sides of the brain appear symmetrical, but they {{function}} asymmetrically. For example, the counterpart of the left-hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right-hemisphere area controlling the left hand. There are, however, several important exceptions, involving language and spatial cognition. The left frontal lobe is dominant for language. If a key language area in the left hemisphere is damaged, it <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> victim unable to speak or understand, whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills.|$|E
5|$|Two engineersAaron and Abesupplement their day-jobs with {{entrepreneurial}} tech projects, {{working out}} of Aaron's garage. During one such research effort, involving electromagnetic reduction of objects' weight, the two men accidentally discover an 'A-to-B' time loop side-effect: objects left in the weight-reducing field exhibit temporal anomalies, proceeding normally (from time 'A,' when the field was activated, to time 'B,' when the field is powered off), then backwards (from 'B' back to 'A') in a continuously repeating sequence, such that objects <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> field in the present, or at some previous point.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Heather awakens at a shopping mall, having fallen asleep while dining at a burger joint; she had been dreaming of being trapped in a demented amusement park, forced to follow roller coaster tracks in her flight from monstrous creatures and subsequently being run down by the roller coaster. Before she <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> mall, a private detective called Douglas Cartland confronts her, claiming to have information about her birth. Heather evades him and discovers that the mall is mostly abandoned except for monsters. She encounters Claudia, who hints about Heather's fate. Heather finds herself in the Otherworld version of the mall — monster-filled and decaying — and is eventually restored back to the original shopping mall where she encounters Douglas, who confesses that Claudia had hired him to find her. Heather leaves the mall and resolves to take the subway home. Having arrived at her residence, Heather discovers that her father has been killed by a monster under the orders of Claudia, who tells her that she will be waiting for her in Silent Hill and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Before he <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> capital, Littlefinger {{offers to}} take Ned {{to the last}} person Jon Arryn spoke to before his death. It {{turns out to be}} a prostitute, Mhaegan, the mother of a baby daughter, who is another of Robert's illegitimate children. Littlefinger reveals Jon Arryn had been searching for Robert's bastards for an unknown reason. When Ned and his guards try to leave, they are ambushed by Jaime Lannister and his men, who want answers for Tyrion's arrest. Ned claims {{responsibility}} for Tyrion's arrest, which leads to a brutal fight between his and Jaime's men. In the end, Ned's guards are killed, including his captain Jory Cassel, whom Jaime stabs through the eye with a dagger. Ned duels with Jaime but is speared through the leg by one of Jaime's guards before Stark and Lannister can finish the fight on their own. Jaime knocks out the guard who interrupted the fight and decides to let Ned live but warns that he wants his brother back. Jaime storms away, leaving Ned bleeding in the dirt, where he quickly faints.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Xgrid system is designed around a job based system; the controller sends agents jobs, and the agents return the responses. The actual computation that the controller executes in an Xgrid system {{is known as a}} job. The job contains all the files required to complete the task successfully, such as the input parameters, data files, directories, executables and/or shell scripts, the files included in an Xgrid job must be able to be executed either simultaneously or asynchronously, or any benefits of running such a job on an Xgrid is lost. Once the job completes, the controller can be set to notify the client of the task's completion or failure, for example by email. The client <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> network while the tasks are running. It can also monitor the job status on demand by querying the controller, although it cannot track the ongoing progress of individual tasks.|$|E

5|$|In {{the primary}} portion of Infinity Blade, the player {{character}} travels a largely linear path through a ruined castle and fights one-on-one battles with oversized enemies. The {{path through the}} castle {{is a series of}} discreet locations where the player can pan the camera around the stationary player character to view a fully three-dimensional area. The player taps locations highlighted onscreen to trigger either a short cutscene as the player character moves to the next location, or a sword battle with an enemy. During combat, the player controls the character's sword by swiping a finger across the screen. Players can touch icons {{at the bottom of the}} screen to dodge attacks by ducking right or left, or to block attacks with a shield, which has a limited number of uses during a single battle. Players may also parry incoming attacks with an intercepting sword move that, for example, parries an attack from the left with a swipe to the left. Each of these three counters <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> enemy vulnerable to counterattack for a short period, but incorrect counters result in damage to the player character, as reflected in the health bar. When players fail in battle en route to the God King, the game resets to the location preceding the previous battle. Enemies can perform attacks that cannot be parried or blocked—such as a shield bash—that must be dodged. Players use two special abilities via icons atop the screen: the Super Attack temporarily stuns the opponent, and magic heals or attacks as indicated by drawing a given symbol. Both require time to recharge after use. When attacking, the player can swipe in any direction, and can do specific attack combinations to deal extra damage.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{previous}} installments, Desmond <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> Animus {{at almost}} any time. This allows Desmond to explore the present-day town of Monteriggioni. The player is also offered virtual training, a mini-game where the player may test their free-running or combat skills.|$|E

25|$|Cooling by {{permitted}} lines: At lower temperatures, more {{levels than}} fine structure levels can be populated via collisions. For example, collisional excitation of the n=2 level of hydrogen will release a Ly-α photon upon de-excitation. In molecular clouds, excitation of rotational lines of CO is important. Once a molecule is excited, it eventually returns {{to a lower}} energy state, emitting a photon which <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> region, cooling the cloud.|$|E
25|$|Firefighters have {{sometimes}} been assaulted {{by members of}} the public while responding to calls. These kinds of attacks can cause firefighters to fear for their safety and may cause them to not have full focus on the situation which could result in injury to their selves or the patient. Firefighter unions have begun to tell firefighters that if they fear for their safety they <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> scene.|$|E

25|$|Carbon <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> {{geosphere}} {{in several}} ways. Carbon dioxide is released during the metamorphosis of carbonate rocks {{when they are}} subducted into the earth's mantle. This carbon dioxide can be released into the atmosphere and ocean through volcanoes and hotspots. It can also be removed by humans through the direct extraction of kerogens {{in the form of}} fossil fuels. After extraction, fossil fuels are burned to release energy, thus emitting the carbon they store into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|In April 1977 {{a patient}} from Harborview Medical Center known as Maria {{claimed to have}} {{experienced}} an out-of-body experience. During her OBE she claimed to have floated outside her body {{and outside of the}} hospital. Maria would later tell her social worker Kimberly Clark that during the OBE she had observed a tennis shoe on the third floor window ledge to {{the north side of the}} building. Clark would go to the north wing of the building and by looking out of the window could see a tennis shoe on one of the ledges. Clark published the account in 1985. The story has since been used in many paranormal books as evidence a spirit <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> body.|$|E
25|$|The main {{character}} is then captured by Hootingham-Gore's forces {{and taken to}} the Goretress, a Gittish Empire prison watched over by Triumgorate member Goreham-Hogg. Using the Gittish Seal, the {{main character}} is able to bypass the Goretress' force fields and helps Sterling, the prison's foreman, to lead a rebellion against Goreham-Hogg. The two defeat Goreham-Hogg and use his key to free the prisoners of the Goretress' solitary confinement, who are actually some of the missing Celestrians that were sent to recover the fyggs. Before anyone <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> Goretress, however, Barbarus attacks, but Stella arrives with the Starflight Express and drives him away. Sterling reveals himself to be {{the captain of the}} Starflight and the three return the captured Celestrians back to the Observatory.|$|E

25|$|Each year, about 400,000 people undergo {{brain mapping}} during neurosurgery. This {{procedure}} is often required {{for people with}} tumors or epilepsy that {{do not respond to}} medication. During this procedure, electrodes are placed on the brain to precisely identify the locations of structures and functional areas. Patients may be awake during neurosurgery and asked to perform certain tasks, such as moving fingers or repeating words. This is necessary so that surgeons can remove only the desired tissue while sparing other regions, such as critical movement or language regions. Removing too much brain tissue can cause permanent damage, while removing too little tissue <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> underlying condition untreated and require additional neurosurgery. Thus, there is a strong need to improve both methods and systems to map the brain as effectively as possible.|$|E
25|$|The group {{enters the}} Matrix {{to visit the}} Oracle, a prophet who {{predicted}} {{the emergence of the}} One. She implies that Neo is not the One and warns Neo that he will soon have to choose between his life and Morpheus' life. Before they <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> Matrix, the group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so Neo {{and the rest of the}} crew can escape. However, their getaway is hindered by Cypher, a crew member who betrayed Morpheus to Agent Smith in exchange for a comfortable life within the Matrix. Cypher disconnects from the Matrix and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. He prepares to disconnect Neo and Trinity as well, but Tank, a crewman whom he had left for dead, kills him.|$|E
25|$|After viewing a question, the {{contestant}} <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> {{game with}} the money already won rather than attempting an answer. If the contestant answers a question incorrectly, then all of their winnings are lost, except that the £1,000 and £32,000 prizes are guaranteed: if a player gets a question wrong above these levels, then the prize drops to the previous guaranteed prize. Answering the £2,000 and £64,000 questions wrong does not reduce the prize money. The prizes are generally non-cumulative; that is, answering a question correctly does not result in the amount being played for being added to the amount already won, rather the amount already won is written off and replaced by a larger sum, usually twice as large. The game ends when the contestant answers a question incorrectly, decides not to answer a question, or answers all questions correctly.|$|E
