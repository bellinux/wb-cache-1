40|$|Energy {{conservation}} measures can bring important environmental and economical {{benefits to the}} most energy-intensive industry sectors such as the pulp and paper industry. The measures include among others investing in more energy efficient process equipment and improving process integration. A tool that has successfully been used in pulp and paper mills to improve process integration and achieve steam savings is pinch analysis. In this master’s thesis, a pinch analysis of {{one part of a}} thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) mill, Norske Skog Skogn, is presented. The study aimed at improving the process integration and to decrease the steam demand of the mill. Additionally, the effect of decreasing the electricity consumption was studied for two different scenarios: when certain amount of the electricity-intensive mechanical pulp is replaced with recycled paper and fillers and/or when implementing more energy efficient refining. The results showed that investing in measures that decrease the electricity consumption of the mill can lead to an insufficient production of internal steam and consequently to an increased demand of external steam to cover the deficit. Another way to cover the deficit of steam is to decrease the steam demand of the process by improving process integration. Pinch analysis was used to identify the major sources of inefficient heat exchange i. e. pinch violations in the system and to propose three retrofits that improve the heat exchanger network. Apart from these three retrofits focusing on the heat exchanger network, two additional retrofits, not connected to the heat exchanger network, were also investigated. These were preheating of certain streams and the integration of a heat pump. The major source of pinch violations is the paper machine heat recovery system, the cooling system and the district heating system. In the proposed retrofits the total <b>clean</b> <b>steam</b> consumption is decreased by improved process integration. In the first retrofit 1. 1 MW of <b>clean</b> <b>steam</b> (4 % of the total <b>clean</b> <b>steam</b> consumption) are recovered by solving pinch violations mainly associated with the district heating system. In the second and third retrofits 2. 2 - 2. 8 MW (8 %- 11 %) respectively of savings are achieved by modifying the paper machine heat recovery system and the district heating system. By investing in a reboiler with higher capacity and preheating certain streams it is possible to save 4. 6 MW (18 %) <b>clean</b> <b>steam.</b> Finally, by integrating a heat pump it is possible to reduce the <b>clean</b> <b>steam</b> consumption by 3. 5 MW (13 %). The combination of the previous retrofits makes it possible to reduce the total <b>clean</b> <b>steam</b> consumption by 8. 9 MW (34 %) ...|$|E
40|$|A heat {{exchanger}} {{process has been}} developed {{for the removal of}} H{sub 2 }S and other noncondensable gases from geothermal steam. The process utilizes a {{heat exchanger}} to condense water from geothermal steam while allowing H{sub 2 }S and other noncondensable gases to pass through in the vapor phase. The condensed water is evaporated to form a <b>clean</b> <b>steam</b> from which over 90 percent of the H{sub 2 }S and other noncondensable gases have been removed. Some of the important advantages of the heat exchanger process are shown in Table 1. The system can be located upstream of a power plant turbine which eliminates much of the potential for corrosion, as well as the requirement for removing H{sub 2 }S from water collected in the main condenser. Since almost all noncondensables are removed, much less steam is needed for air ejector operation. The heat exchanger process is simple: it has no chemical addition requirements or sludge by-products and utilizes standard equipment found in many power plant applications. The regular power plant operators and maintenance crews can easily understand and run the system with minimal attention. Capital and operating costs are competitive with those for currently available H{sub 2 }S-abatement technology, although significant economic advantages over downstream abatement processes may result due to the use of <b>clean</b> <b>steam</b> in the turbines...|$|E

40|$|The {{food and}} fine-chemical {{industry}} has {{for a long}} time been troubled by red brown to dark violet deposits in distillation columns, storage vessels and distribution systems for purified water and <b>clean</b> <b>steam.</b> Owing to the visual appearance of those deposits, the phenomena was referred as rouge. Although formation of rouge, i. e. rouging, is a commonly known phenomenon in stainless steel systems, the basic mechanism is still not fully understood. The phenomenon causes precipitation of iron as fine red-brown ferric oxide or hydroxide particles. Moreover adherent discoloration of the stainless steel surface is often observed in conjunction with the loosely adhered rouge particles. The affected systems are usually made of austenitic CrNiMo steel grade AISI 316 L, which is the standard material for pharmaceutical and food plants. Although rouging has been known for decades the amount of research on this phenomenon is still very limited. One reason for this is the fact that rouging is a difficult and elaborate task to study experimentally in laboratory and require long experimental times. On the other hand, rouge removal is required to prevent both equipment and product purity, thus it is crucial to find a cost effective de-rouging process, and to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the SS surface soon after treatment. This work is focused on the physico-chemical characterization of passive films on AISI 316 L SS mimicking rouged layers in order to get more information on the mechanism of rouging formation. We initially studied the electrochemical conditions (potential, bath composition, temperature and pH) inducing rouging on the surface of AISI 316 L. The prepared passive films were characterized by Photocurrent Spectroscopy (PCS) and by impedance measurements in order to get information on their composition and on their electronic properties. Ellipsometric measurements were also performed in order to get information on the thickness of the films.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research project is to study the impact of an innovative wort production method on flavour quality and flavour stability of lager beer. The innovation comprises 1) thick and fast mashing under anti-oxidative conditions to save time and energy; 2) high mashing-off temperature (95 &# 176;C) compared to conventional mashing-off temperature of 78 &# 176;C; 3) acidified sparging; and 4) in-line wort stripping with culinary steam and in-kettle stripping during filling of the kettle (till kettle is full) for continuously stripping of unwanted volatiles. After wort filtration and in-line stripping, no additional boiling is required. Special {{attention was paid to}} mashing-in conditions (O 2, pH, temperature), in order to prevent early oxidation. During transfer of the mash to the mash vessel, the malt aldehydes are to be stripped off as much as possible. <b>Clean</b> <b>steam</b> injectors in combination with over-sized chimneys and condensate traps and high mashing-off temperatures should facilitate the release and stripping of unwanted volatile aldehydes. Mashing-off at temperatures above 95 &# 176;C has three aims: 1. strip off unwanted volatile aldehydes; 2. partially degrade of SMM to DMS (flavour of Brussels sprouts); 3. coagulate and flocculate high molecular weight proteins. The holding time of the elevated mashing-off temperature will depend on these three items. The fastest and thickest mashing conditions were first evaluated to produce concentrated mashes in the shortest time frame. A thick mash results in smaller total volumes so that low water and reduced energy input is required during mashing. An efficient sparging will then lead to lowest volumes for boiling with highest extract content which is again beneficial in view of energy consumption and brewhouse capacity. Fine milling in combination with thinbed wort filtration resulted in highly comparable wort, beer, and ageing profiles compared to conventional coarse milling/lautertun operations. High mashing-off temperature resulted in a fast wort filtration, bright sweet wort and a low heat load (based on the TB-Index). Due to the high mashing-off and wort filtration temperature, SMM is already transformed into free DMS which evaporates partially at mashing-off. Sufficient conversion of SMM and removal of DMS is possible by in-line and in-kettle <b>clean</b> <b>steam</b> injection during filling of the combination vessel. Sparging with acidified water at high temperature minimised the extraction of extra proanthocyanidins during the sparging step ending up with comparable amounts compared to conventional wort production. High mashing-off temperature also resulted in decreased levels of haze sensitive proteins, in comparison with conventional mashing-off temperature. The use of steam to form and strip DMS however results in the formation of a low trub content, but the small protein flocks are difficult to remove. No striking differences have been found when comparing conventionally produced beers with the innovative beers. However, important differences have been observed when the beers were subjected to ageing. Due to the acidified sparging, high aldehyde contents have been found in the pitching wort upon innovative wort production. The low pH of sparging liquor seems to result in an enhanced release of imine-bound aldehydes. As apparent from analysis of pitching wort, these free aldehydes have not been efficiently stripped off (in contrast to DMS), but after fermentation, comparable levels of free aldehydes were found in the fresh beers. However, during ageing of the innovative beer, lower levels of aldehydes were found resulting in significantly lower overall ageing sensory scores. The release of aldehydes during acidified sparging, even at conventional sparge temperatures of 78 &# 176;C, is also malt dependent. In conclusion, the innovative wort production, executed in less than 3. 5 hours, results in a highly comparable fresh beer, but with an extended flavour stability compared to conventional beer production. Concentrated mashes and highest extract content due to low sparge rates will result in a decreased need of energy for wort production. The high throughput of the two vessel brewhouse with a thinbed filter will also reduce the investment cost.

While the stern of the ship was stripped down to the keels, the reconstruction of the bow required the replacement of 6.5 t of sacrificial oak timber. Once the frames were refitted, the surviving parts of the original frames were <b>steam</b> <b>cleaned</b> at 3000psi, to kill fungal spores.|$|R
40|$|This NebGuide {{provides}} information on how groundwater exists, where it exists, and how it moves. Key definitions are highlighted. Water is the life blood of every living creature on earth. Approximately 70 percent of the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface is covered with water. Through the wonders of nature, water can take on many different forms, from the water we drink, to the ice we use to chill a glass of lemonade, to the water vapor used to <b>steam</b> <b>clean</b> equipment. It {{is easy to understand}} the significance water plays in our lives, but it may be much more difficult to understand the water that exists below the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface, called groundwater...|$|R

These companies have focused on energy recycling, a process that turns waste energy (usually heat) into <b>clean</b> power and <b>steam.</b> [...] Casten has said {{his goal is to}} combat global warming in a profitable way, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs at the same time.|$|R
40|$|CIVINSThe Navy {{will need}} to upgrade the utility {{infrastructure}} of its installations in the coming years. There are several factors that they {{will need to}} take into consideration, to include energy conservation, environmental and quality of life issues. Peak shaving and load shedding are good business decisions and could be conducted in a better way than they are currently being done. Fuel cells offer a variety of options for co-generation and power management. A prudent use of the by-products of electric generation from a fuel cell could increase efficiency of the plant and provide cost savings to the user. The objective {{of this paper is to}} look at the problem of being able to peak shave without penalizing the equipment and personnel on board ships that are in port. By understanding the technologies available in fuel cells, a proper choice and proposal can be made. As Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells become commercially available, the Navy needs to consider using them as power sources for the piers. The co-generation capabilities would be used to generate <b>clean</b> shore <b>steam,</b> one of the many pier services that the ships require[URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the feasibility of geothermal resource utilization at the Puna Sugar Company cane sugar processing plant, located in Keaau, Hawaii. A proposed well site area was selected based on data from surface exploratory surveys. The liquid dominated well flow enters a binary thermal arrangement, which results in an acceptable quality steam for process use. Hydrogen sulfide in the well gases is incinerated, leaving sulfur dioxide in the waste gases. The sulfur dioxide in turn is recovered and used in the cane juice processing at the sugar factory. The <b>clean</b> geothermal <b>steam</b> from the binary system can be used directly for process requirements. It replaces steam generated by the firing of the waste fibrous product from cane sugar processing. The waste product, called bagasse, has a number of alternative uses, but an evaluation clearly indicated it should continue to be employed for steam generation. This steam, no longer required for process demands, can be directed to increased electric power generation. Revenues gained by the sale of this power to the utility, in addition to other savings developed through the utilization of geothermal energy, can offset the costs associated with hydrothermal utilization.

50|$|Traditionally, root {{vegetables}} held {{a very high}} status in First Nations food systems. Root vegetables were important for food, ceremonial and economic reasons. Some nations held a First Roots ceremony to show respect for the roots before the community went digging for their needs. Roots were dried in large quantities, traded {{from one place to}} another and were kept as a “back-up” in times of food shortage. For example, during the summer months, St'at'imc, Nlaka'pamux and Secwepemc women would dig the corms of Yellow Glacier Lily (Erythronium grandiflorum). Families would gather upwards of 2000 lbs. The corms were <b>cleaned</b> then <b>steamed</b> or pit-cooked. Large quantities of yellow glacier lily roots would be dried for later use or for trade. In addition, Camas used to be an important staple across Southern BC. Access to and the use of camas by Interior communities was made possible through trade form the peoples of what is now northern Washington. Large camas beds on southern Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands were kept free of invading plants through regular clearing and burning. Traditionally, for the Kwakwaka’wakw village of Haada, trade in {{root vegetables}} (springbank clover (Trifolium wormskioldii), silverweed and northern riceroot (Fritillaria camschatcensis) with the Nuxalk and Heiltsuk was an important part of their regional economy.|$|R
