The telephone could then be screwed directly onto the matching Bell set 26, making a true, but very heavy, telephone set, or screwed down onto the desk of a CCB (<b>coin</b> <b>collecting</b> <b>box),</b> in a Public Telephone Kiosk. In this form it was fitted with a modified dial, a more durable handset cord, and was re-numbered as the Tele. 242. There was one other variant. With modified internals and designed purely to be used in combination with a Bellset 39a or 44, this was the Tele. 248 in the guise of the Extension Plans 5 & 7. This type of telephone is often featured in British made period television dramas. Curiously, the telephone often rings despite not being fitted with any bell unit.|$|E

2500|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries <b>coin</b> <b>collecting</b> {{remained}} a {{pursuit of the}} well-to-do.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, <b>coin</b> <b>collecting</b> increased further in popularity. [...] The market for coins expanded to include not only antique coins, but foreign or otherwise exotic currency. Coin shows, trade associations, and regulatory bodies emerged during these decades.

50|$|In 1938, Whitman began {{publishing}} coin boards, used by coin collectors {{to store}} their collections. In 1942, the company published its first price guide, The Official Blue Book of U.S. Coins. This started an expanding line of books aimed at numismatists {{which would include}} hundreds of titles. The line continued as Western was sold to Mattel in 1982, then spun off and renamed Golden Books Family Entertainment. The new company sold off Whitman Coin Products and other non-kids lines to St. Martin's Press. They in turn sold off just the Whitman Coin Products line to the H.E. Harris company, another publisher specializing in <b>coin</b> <b>collecting</b> materials. H.E.
