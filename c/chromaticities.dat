25|$|Use of {{the three}} primary colors is not {{sufficient}} to reproduce all colors; only colors within the color triangle defined by the <b>chromaticities</b> of the primaries can be reproduced by additive mixing of non-negative amounts of those colors of light.|$|E
25|$|For an {{additive}} set {{of primary}} colors for human vision, as {{in a television}} or computer display screen, projector, or other emissive electronic visual displays, the usual choice is red, green, and blue (RGB), although the primaries' specific <b>chromaticities</b> can vary.|$|E
50|$|In <b>chromaticity</b> scales, {{lightness}} is factored out, leaving two dimensions. Two lights {{with the}} same spectral power distribution, but different luminance, will have identical <b>chromaticity</b> coordinates. The familiar CIE (x, y) <b>chromaticity</b> diagram is very perceptually non-uniform; small perceptual changes in <b>chromaticity</b> in greens, for example, translate into large distances, while larger perceptual differences in <b>chromaticity</b> in other colors are usually much smaller.|$|R

25|$|The diagram {{represents}} {{all of the}} <b>chromaticities</b> {{visible to}} the average person. These are shown in color and this region is called the gamut of human vision. The gamut of all visible <b>chromaticities</b> on the CIE plot is the tongue-shaped or horseshoe-shaped figure shown in color. The curved edge of the gamut is called the spectral locus and corresponds to monochromatic light (each point representing a pure hue of a single wavelength), with wavelengths listed in nanometers. The straight edge on {{the lower part of}} the gamut is called the line of purples. These colors, although they are on the border of the gamut, have no counterpart in monochromatic light. Less saturated colors appear in the interior of the figure with white at the center.|$|E

25|$|The CIE model capitalises on {{this fact}} by {{defining}} Y as luminance. Z is quasi-equal to blue stimulation, or the S cone response, and X {{is a mix}} (a linear combination) of cone response curves chosen to be nonnegative. The XYZ tristimulus values are thus analogous to, but different from, the LMS cone responses of the human eye. Defining Y as luminance has the useful result that for any given Y value, the XZ plane will contain all possible <b>chromaticities</b> at that luminance.|$|E

40|$|Phosphor-converted white {{light-emitting}} diodes (pc-white LEDs) utilize a blue LED chip converted by the phosphor to obtain white light emission. Pc-white LEDs have {{become one of}} the most popular white LEDs. The reliability concerns of pc-white LEDs involve both lumen maintenance and <b>chromaticity</b> state. However, previous research on the health of LEDs has not taken <b>chromaticity</b> state shift into consideration. Therefore, this paper investigates the <b>chromaticity</b> state shift of pc-white LEDs during an aging test using a data-driven prognostic approach. The <b>chromaticity</b> coordinates (u', v') in the CIE 1976 color space are used to define the states of <b>chromaticity.</b> The Euclidean distance measures between two different <b>chromaticity</b> states represent the <b>chromaticity</b> state shift of LED after aging. A nonlinear dual-exponential model is selected to describe the <b>chromaticity</b> state shift process. Usually, the LED industry used an extrapolating approach to project future states of LED lighting sources, which relies on the nonlinear least square method to fit the obtained data and extrapolates the fitting curve to get the future state. In this paper, a recursive nonlinear filter (an unscented Kalman filter) is used to track the future <b>chromaticity</b> state. The result shows that the unscented Kalman filter approach can improve the prognostic accuracy more compared with the conventional extrapolating approach.

25|$|In <b>chromaticity</b> diagrams, a {{line that}} has {{constant}} perceived hue must be curved, so that the Abney effect is accounted for. The <b>chromaticity</b> diagrams that have been corrected for the Abney effect are therefore excellent illustrations of the non-linear nature of the visual system. Also, the Abney effect does not disallow any and all straight lines on <b>chromaticity</b> diagrams. One may mix two monochromatic lights and not see a shift in hue, thereby suggesting a straight-line plot for the different levels of mixture would be appropriate on a <b>chromaticity</b> diagram.|$|R
50|$|A {{color space}} is a {{three-dimensional}} space; that is, a color is specified {{by a set}} of three numbers (the CIE coordinates X, Y, and Z, for example, or other values such as hue, colorfulness, and luminance) which specify the color and brightness of a particular homogeneous visual stimulus. A <b>chromaticity</b> is a color projected into a two-dimensional space that ignores brightness. For example, the standard CIE XYZ color space projects directly to the corresponding <b>chromaticity</b> space specified by the two <b>chromaticity</b> coordinates known as x and y, making the familiar <b>chromaticity</b> diagram shown in the figure. The Planckian locus, the path that the color of a black body takes as the blackbody temperature changes, is often shown in this standard <b>chromaticity</b> space.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} a novel dichromatic-based method for {{estimating}} illuminant <b>chromaticity.</b> The proposed method is essentially based on the Dichromatic Slope and Dichromatic Line Space that we introduce. Dichromatic slope is {{the slope of the}} dichromatic line that passes the image <b>chromaticity</b> of a pixel in <b>chromaticity</b> space. It is specularity-invariant and can be computed for each pixel. Accordingly, each pixel can be projected into a three-dimensional dichromatic line space defined in terms of image <b>chromaticity</b> and dichromatic slope. Reliable dichromatic lines can then be obtained by detecting local maxima in dichromatic line space. Illuminant <b>chromaticity</b> is easily estimated by finding the intersections of the resulting dichromatic lines. The proposed method has some advantages. It does not require precise color segmentation, and therefore, can deal with highly textured images. In addition, the proposed method does not suffer from nearly parallel dichromatic lines and it can estimate artificial illuminant <b>chromaticity.</b> ...|$|R
