5|$|Starting {{from the}} release of Stage 2, changes {{were made to the}} hunter classes. Every class now {{possesses}} the ability to deploy a force field, an ability once exclusive to the Trapper class. It can be used to limit the Monster's movement to a small area. The ability's <b>cooldown</b> time decreases when the hunters deal enough damage to the monster. Starting from Stage 2, the health of all hunters regenerate if they manage to avoid damage, and they no longer have to rely on the Medic class.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} five Monsters {{featured}} in Evolve. Similar to the Hunters, players need to inflict a certain amount of damage before unlocking a new Monster. The five different Monster-types also have different abilities, both offensive and defensive. Players control the Monster from a third-person perspective, and it features gameplay similar to an action game, unlike the Hunters. More abilities are given to a Monster after its evolution. Gameplay mechanics do not change much after the release of Stage 2, but monsters are made more powerful. They are given more health, stamina, armor, and skill points to unlock all abilities. <b>Cooldown</b> time abilities also shortened and recharge rate becomes significantly faster.|$|E
5|$|In Computer Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a rocket as {{it attempts to}} shoot a pair of flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire. The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. Missiles are fired one at a time, and there is a <b>cooldown</b> period between launches. The player's rocket follows Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the rocket can rotate at a constant rate without inertia. The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around the screen in tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left or right by turning their rocket.|$|E
40|$|Criteria {{substantiated}} by {{experimental and}} real-time simulation data ensure optimal utlization of liquid nitrogen injected for cooling a 0. 3 -m transonic cryogenic tunnel (TCT). Research includes simulated <b>cooldowns</b> using procedures normally employed {{by each of}} several TCT operators, simulated <b>cooldowns</b> at constant mach number, simulated <b>cooldowns</b> at various constant fan speeds and <b>cooldowns</b> at constant metal-to-gas temperature differences...|$|R

2500|$|... was {{published}} by Yehuda Simmons in 1989. It was the first persistent game world of its kind without the traditional hourly resets and points-based puzzle solving progression systems. Avalon introduced equilibrium and balance (<b>cooldowns),</b> skill-based player vs player combat and concepts such as player-run governments and player housing.|$|R
5|$|In {{terms of}} combat, the game allows players {{to create and}} {{customise}} their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four categories of fighting moves called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time. The Pressen moves are Regen (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous moves) and <b>Cooldown</b> (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen moves will {{be made available to}} the player {{over the course of the}} game: the moves enable them to do things like stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct. Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer and Junk Bolt.|$|E
5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player {{off to one side}} of the CRT display due to the limited space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a <b>cooldown</b> period.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana uses an action-based battle system {{similar to}} other entries in the Mana series: {{navigation}} and actions occur in real time within battlefields rendered to the scale of characters within it. After each battle, treasure chests are unlocked which can contain items or new familiars. During battle, the character can attack, switching forms to deliver different attacks, and dodge enemy attacks when correctly timed. During battle, assigned abilities are displayed in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. After each skill is used in battle, a <b>cooldown</b> meter is activated. The skill cannot be used again until the meter is empty. Three types of weapons are available in-game: swords, spears and bows. Each weapon, when equipped, grants a different skill and elemental attribute. The elemental attributes can be used against monsters aligned with a vulnerable element. Enemies can also be weak to attacks using certain weapons. In addition to single-player battles, raid battles allow up to eight players to participate using an online connection.|$|E
50|$|Illidan {{appears as}} a playable {{character}} in the MOBA video game Heroes of the Storm. In the game, his trait reduces his <b>cooldowns</b> by one second and heals him whenever he uses basic attacks. He also {{has the ability to}} move quickly to and jump over his foes.|$|R
50|$|Avalon: The Legend Lives was {{published}} by Yehuda Simmons in 1989. It was the first persistent game world of its kind without the traditional hourly resets and points-based puzzle solving progression systems. Avalon introduced equilibrium and balance (<b>cooldowns),</b> skill-based player vs player combat and concepts such as player-run governments and player housing.|$|R
50|$|Combat is action-based with moves {{performed}} in real-time. All combat is {{centered around the}} use of special skill sets on <b>cooldowns.</b> Players can also perform ground and aerial combos by utilizing certain skills in order to render enemies unable to retaliate but can also {{play the role of}} a healer or supporter when necessary.|$|R
5|$|There {{are three}} unique Titan classes, {{variants}} of light, medium, and heavy, with inversely related speed and armor: the all-rounder Atlas, the bulky Ogre, and the fleet-footed Stryder. The latter two chassis are unlocked upon finishing both faction campaigns and were later made unlockable by leveling up as well. Each chassis has a respective Core power that {{works on a}} <b>cooldown</b> timer: respectively, increased damage, increased shields, and unlimited dashes. Titan tactical ability options include stopping enemy ammunition in midair to throw back in their direction, emitting electrified smoke to hurt and repel pilots climbing the Titan's back, and deploying a defensive wall. Additionally, players can equip two perk kits to customize for their preferred strategy. Their primary weapons include rocket launchers, lightning cannons, and chainguns. Titans can act autonomously when put in guard and follow modes, which directs the Titan either to protect their vicinity or to tail their pilot, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume control}} of Jeremy, a sword-wielding, melee-focused character, and Alysa, who uses {{crossbows}} to deliver ranged attacks. The game {{can be played}} as a single player game, in which the player alternates between controlling Jeremy and Alysa, or as a local co-op game, in which two players play cooperatively, with one controlling each character. Blood Knights does not support online co-op. Like most hack and slash games, the control scheme is minimal. When controlling Jeremy, players can chain attacks using one button (the X button on the Xbox 360), and can use a number of special attacks that have a <b>cooldown</b> timer, including a heavy blow, a whirlwind attack, and a power that draws distant enemies to Jeremy. While controlling Alysa, the game functions as a twin-stick shooter, in which movement is controlled by one thumbstick or set of keys, and firing weapons {{is controlled by the}} other thumbstick or another set of keys. Alysa also has special attacks, including the ability to fire flaming arrows and a grenade attack. In single player gameplay, the player can switch between Jeremy and Alysa by pressing a button (the Y button on the Xbox 360). Players can transfer health, in the form of blood, between the two playable characters, healing one {{at the expense of the}} other.|$|E
25|$|Late October 2012, an {{indictment}} was handed to Hari in his holding cell, which contained nine {{criminal charges against}} Hari: eight crimes of violence and one moving violation. The moving violation relates to an incident in March 2010, when a pedestrian sustained injuries. The eight crimes of violence are: attempted manslaughter of Koen Everink (who was murdered in 2016, however without link to Badr Hari), two assaults in night club Club Air, the assault of the brother of an ex-partner in bar <b>Cooldown,</b> an assault in club Jimmy Woo, an assault of two people including a woman in July 2011, and the assault of a doorman in 2010. An investigation is on going. If convicted he could face up to four years in prison.|$|E

50|$|The {{second round}} of Closed Beta Testing began on 1 December 2013, and ended on 21 February 2014, with {{the removal of the}} beta key requirement, a {{rebalancing}} of the <b>cooldowns</b> to allow regular solo sessions throughout the day, and updates to allow single players to win the game. The developer have promised a Championship Trophy, which will be webcast, and the winner(s) will have their name engraved on the trophy as Round 1 Winners.|$|R

Each of these changes is outlined in greater detail below...|$|R
25|$|The heavy cost {{of these}} battles slowly {{exhausted}} Egypt's treasury {{and contributed to}} the gradual decline of the Egyptian Empire in Asia. The severity of these difficulties is stressed {{by the fact that the}} first known labour strike in recorded history occurred during Year 29 of Ramesses III's reign, when the food rations for the favoured and elite royal tomb-builders and artisans in the village of Set Maat her imenty Waset (now known as Deir el-Medina), could not be provisioned. Something in the air (possibly the Hekla 3 eruption) prevented much sunlight from reaching the ground and also arrested global tree growth for almost two full decades until 1140BC. The result in Egypt was a substantial increase in grain prices under the later reigns of Ramesses VI–VII, whereas the prices for fowl and slaves remained constant. Thus the <b>cooldown</b> affected Ramesses III's final years and impaired his ability to provide a constant supply of grain rations to the workmen of the Deir el-Medina community.|$|E
500|$|In Overwatch, Tracer is {{classified}} as an [...] "offense" [...] character. She is also listed as a two-star (medium) difficulty character for players. Reflecting her offensive role, she comes equipped with dual [...] "Pulse Pistols," [...] which reload quickly and deal damage rapidly at a short range. Her speed is especially noted by video game media, as she is the fastest character on the game's roster. This attribute is noted {{to be one of}} the advantages that comes with playing as her, but also an annoyance to opposing players. Her speed is supplemented through her [...] "Blink" [...] and [...] "Recall" [...] abilities—Blink, which comes with three charges, allows her to teleport a short distance in the same direction she is traveling. Using this ability may allow Tracer to [...] "zip behind an enemy in an instant for surprise attacks, or dodge completely out of the line of fire". This ability has a <b>cooldown</b> period, meaning the player has to wait for each Blink to recharge, although the <b>cooldown</b> period is relatively short. In addition, her Recall ability allows her to rewind to her position three seconds prior, as well as resetting her health and ammo. Like Blink, her Recall ability also has a <b>cooldown</b> period. Although Tracer has a speed advantage, she also has one of the lowest health pools in the game. Finally, her ultimate ability is her [...] "Pulse Bomb": a sticky that clings to the first surface or hero it hits, then detonates shortly after, dealing area of effect damage.|$|E
500|$|If players {{commit crimes}} while playing, the game's law {{enforcement}} agencies may respond as indicated by a [...] "wanted" [...] meter in the head-up display (HUD). On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum six-star level, efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive). Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The wanted meter enters a <b>cooldown</b> mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight.|$|E
50|$|The Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was {{originally}} a 2014 April Fools' Day prank that proved so popular {{it became a}} proper rotating game mode; in URF, champion abilities have no resource cost and have their <b>cooldowns</b> reduced by 80%, double the normal cap of 40% that can be attained through items. Additionally, champions have increased movement speed, faster passive gold gain, and increased attack speed. Because some champions are naturally much more powerful in this mode because of how their kit works, this mode is not seen as much because {{it is difficult to}} balance.|$|R
50|$|The {{new roles}} system {{introduced}} in Darkfall Unholy Wars requires the player {{to pick up}} a role, along with 2 schools from that specific role. One of the schools is set by the player as the primary and the other as the secondary, and each school contains 4 skills/spells, and the ultimate, the most powerful in that school.The biggest difference between the primary and secondary schools is that you can only use the ultimate from your primary school. The skills/spells available in the secondary school have full potential, but require more mana and stamina, and have increased <b>cooldowns</b> and charging times compared to the primaries.|$|R
50|$|Each Character has a {{selection}} of unique abilities which unlock within the first few levels of play. Each Character has a main attack, secondary attack, unique passive ability, and 2 extra skills which can be triggered when desired and have in built <b>cooldowns,</b> limiting their use. The Unique passive ability allows the class to utilize their class mechanics, for example the Tomb Raiser class obtains charges called 'souls' either when a set period of time has passed or when an enemy is defeated. The Tomb Raiser can store up to 3 of these charges {{at any one time}} and can expend them using their secondary attack ability to summon NPC character minions to help him in combat.|$|R
500|$|Among his advantages, {{his move}} {{combinations}} contribute to his high mobility, {{compared to other}} Overwatch playable characters. Doomfist can easily reach and neutralize enemies occupying high ground, such as snipers. He is most effective against low-mobility opponents, but susceptible to high-mobility opponents, such as Pharah, Mercy, and Sombra. Among his disadvantages, Doomfist is dependent on his abilities to escape groups of enemies, leaving the player helpless when his abilities are unavailable (on <b>cooldown).</b> Doomfist's large [...] "hitbox", or area for taking damage, disadvantages him to characters such as Reaper, Roadhog, and Ana's sleep dart.|$|E
500|$|If {{the player}} commits crimes while playing, the game's law {{enforcement}} agencies may respond as indicated by a [...] "wanted" [...] meter in the head-up display (HUD), which increases as the player commits more crimes. On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level, and the higher the level, the greater the response for law enforcement (for example, at the maximum six-star level, police helicopters and military swarm to lethally dispatch players). Law enforcement officers will continue {{to search for the}} player after they leave the wanted vicinity. The wanted meter enters a <b>cooldown</b> mode and eventually recedes when the player is hidden from the officers' line of sight.|$|E
500|$|Jobs have a {{combination}} of unique [...] "job traits", [...] "job abilities", and magic spells, giving them a specific role within group play due to their area of expertise. Job traits are passive abilities that are always in effect, while job abilities must be activated by the player in order to come into effect. They last a limited time and have a [...] "cooldown" [...] period {{before they can be}} used again. Magic spells are available to certain jobs, and in addition to a <b>cooldown</b> period, they often consume MP or some form of item in order to be cast, {{while at the same time}} requiring the user to stand still. Additionally, each job has a special one-hour ability that performs an extraordinary function.|$|E
50|$|Combat {{takes place}} when {{opposing}} forces attack each other, whether under player control or not. To prevail in battle, the player must {{make use of}} appropriate units and abilities to fit the situation. In addition to a standard attack, each squad has three special abilities; for example, sword-and-shield infantry can stun enemies with a shield bash, raise their shields to sacrifice mobility for frontal defense, and can use a brief heavy strike to unleash wide-sweeping high-damage attacks. Special abilities operate on <b>cooldowns.</b> The more the player uses a certain unit type, the more experience is gained for that unit type. Experience points {{can be used to}} upgrade the passive attributes and active abilities for those units.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the player}} earns money and points for killing monsters, they gain {{experience}} levels within the match, starting at Level 1 {{and up to}} Level 12. Level gains increase the health and mana capacity and base attack values for the player's hero, and every three levels, the player can select one of three beneficial traits to give to their hero {{for the duration of}} that match. Further, as the player's score increases, they fill an [...] "Unchained" [...] meter. Once this meter is full, the player can activate it at any time to briefly enter a powered-up state where their attacks do more damage, and regain their mana and skill <b>cooldowns</b> at a much-faster rate, making them more effective in battle.|$|R
500|$|The {{preproduction}} {{team also}} tweaked the game systems. They chose a skill system that used nanotechnology augmentation, {{unique to the}} player character, as [...] "special powers" [...] instead of [...] "die-rolls" [...] or skills that required granular management. They also built a conversation structure based on console role-playing game setups, and drafted the augmentation upgrade, inventory, and skill screens. They also designed an in-game text editor for taking notes, and [...] "reward systems" [...] for skill points, reduced weapon and tool <b>cooldowns,</b> and augmentation upgrades. Preproduction had generated 300 pages of documentation by March 1998. The document grew to 500 pages with [...] "radically different" [...] content by their April 1999 Alpha 1 deadline. Of Spector's original design document, the marketing section was the only part left unedited.|$|R
500|$|The {{gameplay}} of Galaxy Game, like Spacewar, involves two monochrome spaceships called [...] "the needle" [...] and [...] "the wedge", each {{controlled by}} a player, attempting to shoot one another while maneuvering on a two-dimensional plane in the gravity well of a star, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. The ships fire torpedoes, which are not affected by the gravitational pull of the star. The ships have a limited number of torpedoes and a limited supply of fuel, which is used when the player fires his thrusters. Torpedoes are fired one at a time, and there is a <b>cooldown</b> period between launches. The ships follow Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the ships can rotate at a constant rate without inertia.|$|E

500|$|When {{a player}} accumulates enough experience, they [...] "level up" [...] and can spend points on three active and three passive abilities, chosen from several options on {{a trio of}} skill trees.. Each ability has a <b>cooldown</b> timer, {{requiring}} players to use them strategically. Points may be switched from one skill tree to another at any time. When a player dies, their experience multiplier is reset. When Alienation story mode is completed, the player unlocks missions with bounty-like assignments and quests with special items as rewards. The player unlocks more difficult enemies, more powerful weapons, {{and the ability to}} complete difficult, procedurally-generated, levels set in the alien's space craft. Two types of [...] "keys" [...] are unlocked {{at the end of the}} game. UFO keys are used for [...] "loot runs", and ark keys are used for player-vs-player fights.|$|E
40|$|Plasma-spray {{technology}} {{is under investigation}} as a method for producing high thermal conductivity beryllium coatings for use in magnetic fusion applications. Recent investigations have focused on optimizing the plasma-spray process for depositing beryllium coatings on damaged beryllium surfaces. Of particular interest has been optimizing the processing parameters to maximize the through-thickness thermal conductivity of the beryllium coatings. Experimental results will be reported {{on the use of}} secondary H{sub 2 } gas additions to improve the melting of the beryllium powder and transferred-arc cleaning to improve the bonding between the beryllium coatings and the underlying surface. Information will also be presented on thermal fatigue tests which were done on beryllium coated ISX-B beryllium limiter tiles using 10 sec cycle times with 60 sec <b>cooldowns</b> and an International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) relevant divertor heat flux slightly in excess of 5 MW/m{sup 2 }...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{improvements}} in superconducting qubit coherence times {{have been achieved}} recently with three-dimensional microwave waveguide cavities coupled to transmon qubits. While many of the measurements in this direction have utilized superconducting aluminum cavities, other recent work has involved qubits coupled to copper cavities with coherence times approaching 0. 1 ms. The copper provides a good path for thermalizing the cavity walls and qubit chip, although the substantial cavity loss makes conventional dispersive qubit measurements challenging. We are exploring various approaches for improving the quality factor of three-dimensional copper cavities, including electropolishing and coating with superconducting layers of tin. We have characterized these cavities on multiple <b>cooldowns</b> and found the tin-plating to be robust. In addition, we have performed coherence measurements on transmon qubits in these cavities and observed promising performance.

25|$|There {{are four}} weapon classes: the Storm Bow, the Volcanic Hammer, the Spirit Knives, and the Frost Shield; each have the {{tactical}} roles {{of a long}} range attacker, slow melee attacker, fast melee attacker and a tank respectively. The active and passive abilities available for each class allow some form of customization. The weapon class and selected abilities (which also have <b>cooldowns)</b> can be changed {{before the start of}} any arena level. Each player must choose a different weapon class. Balfus can be made to interact with the environment's spiritual plane by ordering him to activate or trigger props like healing pedestals or set off a stunning blast from traps. He can travel with the characters, float in space or can be called to their location. Good positioning and communication will help the players use Balfus efficiently; the need to do this while facing waves of enemies, makes the game more challenging.|$|R
