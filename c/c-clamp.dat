2500|$|Most {{instruments}} are suspended or {{supported by a}} [...] "U" [...] shaped yoke, or 'trunnion arm' fixed {{to the sides of}} the instrument, normally near its center of gravity. On the end of such, a clamp (known as a hook-clamp, <b>C-clamp,</b> or pipe clamp—pipe referring to battens) is normally fixed, made in a [...] "C" [...] configuration with a screw to lock the instrument onto the pipe or batten from which it is typically hung. Once secured, the fixture can be panned and tilted using tension adjustment knobs on the yoke and clamp. An adjustable c-wrench, ratchet (US) or spanner (UK) is often used to assist the technician in adjusting the fixture.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal was}} to design and {{manufacture}} a matchplate {{to be used by}} the Central Washington University (CWU) Engineering Department to cast <b>C-clamps.</b> These castings are produced in the University’s foundry and would be prepared as a secondary project for the department’s basic machining course. The design produced allows the <b>C-clamps</b> to be molded in a single pour for a full class of students, which is approximately sixteen (16). The desire was to achieve a design that was functional, yet allowed room and/or means to be easily modified or repaired, if needed. This was achieved through designing the <b>C-clamps</b> in a computer based model in the program Solidworks. By using Solidworks it allowed the imprints to be repeatedly modified and improved throughout the design process. This also allows future modifications to be easily made by subsequent students. This model was then converted into imprints for the matchplate and printed via a rapid prototyping system of a 3 D printer. The results of these efforts yielded a functioning matchplate for testing. The results of the tests proved that it is capable of producing <b>C-clamps</b> effectively in enough quantity to supply the engineering department for the class projec...|$|R

Known for their dense layering and simple, yet beautiful vocal harmonies, <b>C-Clamp</b> released only two full-length albums in their career. Although they performed live infrequently, they managed to share the stage with many noteworthy bands of that era, including Braid, Castor, Dianogah, Karate and Hum.|$|E

50|$|Loads are {{attached}} to the batten in various ways. Most lighting fixtures, for example, utilize a <b>C-clamp</b> to rigidly secure the light onto the batten, in conjunction with a safety cable that is looped around the batten to prevent the light from falling should the <b>C-clamp</b> connection fail. Non-traveling curtains (e.g., borders) often employ cloth ties, similar to shoestrings, that are hand tied onto the batten.|$|E

50|$|This {{self-locking}} {{property is}} {{one reason for the}} very large use of the screw in threaded fasteners such as wood screws, sheet metal screws, studs and bolts. Tightening the fastener by turning it puts compression force on the materials or parts being fastened together, but no amount of force from the parts will cause the screw to untighten. This property is also the basis for the use of screws in screw top container lids, vises, <b>C-clamps,</b> and screw jacks. A heavy object can be raised by turning the jack shaft, but when the shaft is released it will stay at whatever height it is raised to.|$|R
5000|$|<b>C-clamps</b> or G-clamps are {{typically}} {{made of steel}} or cast iron, though smaller clamps may be made of pot metal. At {{the top of the}} [...] "C" [...] is usually a small flat edge. At the bottom is a threaded hole through which a large threaded screw protrudes. One end of this screw contains a flat edge of similar size to the one {{at the top of the}} frame, and the other end usually a small metal bar, perpendicular to the screw itself, which is used to gain leverage when tightening the clamp. When the clamp is completely closed, the flat end of the screw is in contact with the flat end on the frame. [...] When the clamp is actually used, it is very rare that this occurs. Generally some other object or objects will be contained between the top and bottom flat edges.|$|R
50|$|In stage {{lighting}} and sound a <b>c-clamp,</b> {{also referred to}} as a pipe clamp, is used to attach a larger piece of hardware, such as a lighting instrument, a speaker, or a dimmer, to a pipe or batten. Newer c-clamps tend to be constructed of aluminum, although steel is also available.|$|E
5000|$|A {{screw-on}} capo {{has some}} form of surface that presses {{against the back of}} the neck of the instrument to hold the bar in place against the strings. This back surface is held to the neck by a screw tightened to apply direct pressure. One form of this capo is effectively a rubber-covered bar built into a <b>C-clamp.</b>|$|E
50|$|The followspot yoke is an {{oversized}} replacement yoke intended to allow an ellipsoidal reflector spot {{to be installed}} into a followspot stand and {{be used as a}} small, short throw followspot. Generally these yokes allow a much wider range of tilt than a conventional yoke, and have had the hole for a <b>c-clamp</b> bolt replaced with a spigot for a spot stand.|$|E
40|$|Unstable pelvic {{fractures}} {{very frequently}} occur with haemorrhage, {{not only from}} the broken pelvis but from the presacral venous plexus and/or iliac arterial or venous branches which may cause hypotension and increases the mortality rate. Very often this type of injury is concurrent with injuries in other organ systems. The compounded nature of these injuries makes it necessary for doctors who may encounter this type of patient to be educated in the techniques to effectively stabilise and treat the patient’s complex injuries. After completing the international standard ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) primary survey to identify a haemodinamically unstable patient with pelvic fracture, we discuss adequate replenishment of lost blood volume and standards of care for such a patient. The best diagnostics are described from transport immobilisation to the placement of external fixators or <b>C-clamps.</b> Likewise indication for intervention of pelvic angiography and therapeutic embolisation are also discussed. The direct surgical hemostasis method of pelvic packing is described in detail. All presented methods are mutually complementary in today’s treatment of these patients...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of bidding boxes: the more common ones are free-standing, placed in the corners on the tabletop. The hanging variant is smaller, with two holders closer together, and {{attached}} {{to the side of}} the table using <b>C-clamps.</b> The latter has the advantage that it does not occupy space on the table, but it can hamper the players' passage to and from their seats, so it gets damaged more easily. In some tournaments an L-shaped metal bracket is slid under the tabletop corners, leaving its other end standing up. This is inserted into a slit in a free-standing bidding box, which then functions like a clamped one. Another alternative is to use side tables, so that bidding boxes as well as refreshments and other belongings can be kept off the playing table. For storage purposes, the boxes usually have either a covered compartment at the bottom to store the bidding cards or a cover which is placed over the bidding cards attaching to the box base.|$|R
5000|$|The {{drawing board}} is an {{essential}} tool. Paper will be attached and kept straight and still, so that the drawing {{can be done with}} accuracy. Generally, different kind of assistance rulers are used in drawing. The drawing board is usually mounted to a floor pedestal in which the board turns to a different position, and also its height can be adjustable. Smaller drawing boards are produced for table-top use. In the 18th and 19th centuries, drawing paper was dampened and then its edges glued to the drawing board. After drying the paper would be flat and smooth. The completed drawing was then cut free. Paper could also be secured to the drawing board with drawing pins [...] or even <b>C-clamps.</b> More recent practice is to use self-adhesive tape to secure paper to the board, including the sophisticated use of individualized adhesive dots from a dispensing roll. Some drawing boards are magnetized, allowing paper to be held down by long steel strips. Boards used for overlay drafting or animation may include registration pins or peg bars to ensure alignment of multiple layers of drawing media.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>C-clamp</b> or G-clamp {{is a type}} of clamp device {{typically}} used to hold a wood or metal workpiece, and often used in, but are not limited to, carpentry and welding. These clamps are called [...] "C" [...] clamps because of their C shaped frame, but are otherwise often called G-clamps or G-cramps because including the screw part they are shaped like an uppercase letter G.|$|E
50|$|Small {{tabletop}} tripods (sometimes called tablepods) {{are also}} available, ranging from relatively flimsy models costing less than US$20, to professional models that can {{cost up to}} US$800 and can support up to 68 kg (150 lb). They are used in situations where a full sized tripod would be too bulky to carry. An alternative is a clamp-pod, which is a ball head attached to a <b>C-clamp.</b>|$|E
50|$|C-clamps are {{commonly}} used in theatrical carpentry for the same purpose that non-theatrical carpenters employ them: for creating a quick, temporary, and non-destructive way of joining two objects together. Legs {{are commonly}} attached to platforms via <b>c-clamp</b> before they are fastened together using a more permanent method (i.e. bolts). Multi-platform assemblies are also commonly joined to one another solely with c-clamps, especially in touring situations where a set needs to be assembled and struck quickly.|$|E
5000|$|An F-clamp, {{also known}} as a bar clamp or speed clamp and a [...] "G-clamp", is a type of clamp. The name comes from its [...] "F" [...] shape. The F-clamp is similar to a <b>C-clamp</b> in use, but has a wider opening {{capacity}} (throat). This tool is used in woodworking while more permanent attachment is being made with screws or glue, or in metalworking to hold pieces together for welding or bolting.|$|E
50|$|The insert {{displays}} the cover art. The colour {{of the cover}} art has been altered: it is of a richer, brown-grey colour base, {{as opposed to the}} light blue base of the original LP release. The new cover is featured in nearly all of the album's modern representations. When the case is opened, the inside shows the photo of the band {{from the back of the}} LP version of the album. The insert unfolds to show the image of the egg in the <b>C-clamp,</b> which has a thin red border around it and credits the image to Deborah Samuel.|$|E
50|$|Most catwalks {{have several}} battens (pipes) that {{lighting}} fixtures may be attached to. Lights are usually attached by a <b>C-Clamp</b> or a hook clamp around the pipes. In {{addition to this}} primary attachment, fixtures generally have an additional safety cable attaching them to the catwalk, so that if the clamp or bolt gives way, the safety cable will catch the light. This is used because the lights are generally very expensive and heavy, but mainly to protect the audience members and performers from the possibility of fixtures falling down from the catwalks. Catwalks often include a platform for a spotlight operator to work from.|$|E
