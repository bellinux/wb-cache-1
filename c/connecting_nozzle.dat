40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown by the authors that the pre-chamber ignition technique operating with fuel-rich pre-chamber combustion strategy is a very effective means of extending the lean limit of combustion with excess air in heavy duty natural gas engines {{in order to improve}} indicated efficiency and reduce emissions. This article presents a study of the influence of pre-chamber volume and nozzle diameter on the resultant ignition characteristics. The two parameters varied are the ratio of pre-chamber volume to engine's clearance volume and the ratio of total area of <b>connecting</b> <b>nozzle</b> to the pre-chamber volume. Each parameter is varied in 3 steps hence forming a 3 by 3 test matrix. The experiments are performed on a single cylinder 2 L engine fitted with a custom made pre-chamber capable of spark ignition, fuel injection and pressure measurement. The measured main and pre-chamber pressure data is then used to perform heat release analysis to understand combustion phenomenon in pre-chamber and the ignition and combustion of fuel-lean charge in main chamber that follows. Within the span of parameter variation, it has been observed that a larger pre-chamber provides higher ignition energy which results in shortened flame development angle and combustion duration. It is also observed that at a given pre-chamber volume, nozzle diameter mainly affects the combustion duration which may be due to difference in penetration depths of pre-chamber jets. The varied parameters seemed to have minor effect on NOx emissions...|$|E
40|$|High-speed {{turbines}} {{are used}} in tipper stage liquid engines of launch vehicles and the most common ones include LH 2 and LOX turbines used in the cryogenic stages. The main constraints in the design Of turbine system for a liquid engine are thermal loads, mass flow and pressure drops in various systems ahead of the turbine inlet. The temperature of the combustion products/gases reaching the turbine blades must be well below the ruching point of the turbine blade material and the mass flow rate must be sufficient to generate the required power. Turbine call be started in two ways, by generating gases using a solid propellant-based spinner motor, and using compressed gases stored in gas bottles. The first method involves design challenges but requires less space and weight. On the other hand, second method is simple but requires more space. Because of the space and weight constraints associated with the upper stages, first method is preferred and discussed in this paper. It consists of a solid propellant-based spinner motor with a convergent-divergent nozzle, a guiding duct <b>connecting</b> <b>nozzle</b> exit, and the turbine inlet manifold {{in the form of}} a torroid with nozzle block having, 39 guiding nozzles. The combustion products generated by the spinner motor are guided to the manifold through the guiding duct. Inlet manifold acts as a reservoir and Supplies hot gases uniformly to the turbine through 39 nozzles. This study addresses the role of computational fluid dynamics in the design of turbine startup system using unstructured cell-centered AUSM+-UP-based finite volume solver with the two-equation turbulence model. The flow and the thermal characteristics of the solid motor with a convergent-divergent nozzle were Studied to evaluate the gas temperature, operating pressure, and flow velocities. The guiding duct along with the inlet manifold was analysed separately to find the drop ill temperature and pressure within the system. From the simulation results, the mass flow through each guiding nozzle, and hence, energy available Could be evaluated to ensure proper functioning of the turbine...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, various {{microfluidic}} fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) {{systems have been}} demonstrated aiming to provide a fully enclosed environment for sterile, contamination and infectious free sorting, and better downstream microfluidic integration for further analysis after sorting. The biggest challenge of μFACS systems, however, is the orders of magnitude lower sorting throughput and purity than commercial aerosol based FACS (90 % purity at 70, 000 cells/sec). To solve this problem, the key innovation {{is to find a}} faster switching mechanism. In this dissertation, the importance of the cell sorting in academic research and clinical practice will be discussed at first. Among the commercial FACS machines, the state-of-the-art performance is achieving above 90 % purity at 70 000 cells/sec. Other reported μFACS presents 1 ~ 2 order of magnitude lower in throughput. In this context, we attempt to use the phenomena of the pulsed laser induced cavitation bubble to switch particles/cells in high speed. The first version simply excited the bubble in the microfluidic channel that is running parallel to the sample channel. The bubble expansion deformed the elastic PDMS channel wall and induced fluid swing in the sample channel which carried target particle/cell flowing into the collection channel. This first trial demonstrated the fast dynamics of this switching mechanism and the strong power the cavitation bubble can affect the flow. However, the deformation of the channel wall extended over hundreds of microns in length, resulting in low post-sort purity. To overcome this, the second version designed a <b>connecting</b> <b>nozzle</b> between the sample channel and the bubble channel. During the expansion of bubble, a liquid jet was created through the nozzle to the sample channel, which limited the disturbance range to tens of microns. With 2 D hydrodynamic focusing, the pulsed laser activated cell sorter (PLACS) demonstrated performance with above 90 % post-sort purity at 3 000 particles/sec. The drop of post-sort purity at higher throughput was {{due to the lack of}} the third dimension focusing which created large time variation in cell arrival time between the detection and switching zones. Then 3 D hydrodynamic focusing that utilized multilayer PDMS with vertical vias solved the synchronization issue but also allows efficient particle switching using a smaller bubble with a smaller perturbation volume, and a shorter on-off switching cycle. As a result, the 3 D PLACS was able to sort at 23 000 cells/sec with ~ 90 % purity or at 45, 000 cells/sec with 45 % purity within a single channel. However, the large amount of diluting sheath fluid needed for tight 3 D focusing requires a high initial cell concentration in samples (> 10 7 cells/ml), which can result in cell clogging in channels, and high pressure pumps to drive fluid through microchannels at high speeds. Then inertial focusing was employed as a substitute to hydrodynamic focusing. The integrated system achieved sorting at 10 000 particles/sec with > 90 % sort purity or 6 000 cells/sec with > 80 % sort purity and used 10 times lower initial concentration cell samples than that in sheath-based PLACS. The achieved PLACS not only outperformed other μFACS but also achieved performance at a level comparable to conventional aerosol-based FACS. It is anticipated that by integrating with upstream and downstream microfluidic cell analysis functions, the developed PLACS will greatly facilitate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics...|$|E

PWSCC occurs due to the synergistic interaction of several factors including tensile weld residual stresses, a corrosion sensitive weld metal (usually Alloy 82 / 182 weld metal) and a corrosive environment. Several mechanical mitigation methods to control PWSCC have been developed in order to alter the weld residual stresses on the nozzle. These methods consist of applying a weld overlay repair (WOR), using a method called mechanical stress improvement process (MSIP), and applying an inlay to the nozzle ID, the latter of which {{is the subject of this}} paper. An inlay consists of machining the pipe ID at the region of the DMW and applying a PWSCC resistant weld material at the machined region. The PWSCC resistant material is mainly Alloy 52 / 152, which has a higher chromium content compared with Alloy 82 / 182. The inlay is a corrosion resistant material, and the proposed application thickness (after final machining) is 3 mm. Therefore, once the crack grows through the inlay, the growth in the underlying A 82 / 182 material is much faster. This leads to a complicated crack shape which is small at the nozzle ID and becomes larger in the original weld material and approaches a balloon shape.

The analysis confirms that terms involving the mean velocity may contribute to the disturbance energy equation as much as the flame forcing ('Rayleigh') term. Besides, the net effect of the non zero Mach number terms on the stability of the modes strongly depends on both the boundary conditions and the flame response.
