5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Urnula craterium allows for both an {{imperfect}} (making asexual spores, or conidia) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; as has often happened in fungal taxonomy, the imperfect form was given a different name, because {{the relationship between the}} perfect and imperfect forms of the same species was not then known. The imperfect stage of Urnula craterium is the plant pathogenic species Conoplea globosa, known to cause a <b>canker</b> disease (Strumella <b>canker)</b> of oak and several other hardwoods.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{a common}} condition characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers (aphthae) in otherwise healthy individuals. The informal term <b>canker</b> sores is also used, mainly in North America, although this may also refer to any mouth ulcer.|$|E
40|$|Fungi {{associated}} with <b>cankers</b> of Russian-olive seedlings at the Montana State Nursery, Missoula, were investigated. Phomopsis elaeagni was most often isolated from and fruiting on <b>cankers.</b> Other associated fungi were Phoma herbarum, P. eupyrena, P. chrysanthemicola, P. exigua, Alternaria alternate, Epicoccum nigrum, and Fusarium moniliforme. Because of its common occurrence on <b>cankers</b> and its reported pathogenicity on Russian-olive, P. elaeagni {{is considered the}} most likely cause of these <b>cankers.</b> Recommendations for reducing future losses from this disease are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey to}} {{determine}} distribution {{and intensity of}} <b>cankers</b> and associated damage in North Dakota windbreak plantings of Russian-olive and Siberian elm was conducted in 1972. Four hundred and thirty-five (76 percent) of 574 Russian-olive examined had <b>cankers,</b> and 552 (72 percent) of 769 Siberian elm examined had <b>cankers.</b> <b>Cankers</b> on trees in all windbreaks except one contained the secondary fungi Cytospora sp., Dothichiza sp., and Camarosporium sp. Tubercularia ulmea, the reported pathogen, was recovered from only one windbreak. Most <b>cankers</b> were on small twigs and branches. The cause of windbreak decline appears to be herbicide injury, with root pruning caused by close cultivation, and soil compaction caused by livestock exerting minor effects in localized areas. Recommendations are made to reduce windbreak decline...|$|R
30|$|Rugonectria castaneicola {{has been}} {{recorded}} on <b>cankers</b> on stems of Castanea crenata Siebold & Zuccarini (Yamamoto et al.[1957]) and {{has been shown to}} be a wound pathogen causing perennial <b>cankers</b> on stems of Abies veitchii Lindley and Acer crataegifolium Siebold & Zuccarini (Kobayashi et al. [2005]). The fungus has also been found on <b>cankered</b> stems of many broadleaf species including Quercus spp. (Hirooka et al.[2005]).|$|R
5|$|B. verticillata is {{significantly}} threatened {{by at least}} three microorganisms. Several populations have reduced or vanished from dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi), such as those at Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve and Gull Rock National Park. The honey fungus Armillaria luteobubalina has killed plants in Torndirrup National Park, and aerial <b>canker</b> (Zythiostroma) has decimated populations at Waychinicup National Park east of Albany.|$|E
5|$|The crop can be {{attacked}} by larvae of the carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae). This pest feeds {{on the outer}} layers of the root, burrowing its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger roots are spoiled. The damage done provides a point of entry for fungal rots and <b>canker.</b> The fly is attracted {{by the smell of}} bruised tissue.|$|E
5|$|A {{declared}} vulnerable species, {{it occurs}} in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and is threatened by dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial <b>canker</b> (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards. Populations take over a decade to produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty years are needed to allow the canopy seed bank to accumulate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cankers</b> {{and leaf}} spots of S. musiva are {{relatively}} easy to detect. <b>Cankers</b> appear on branches and new shoots off poplar trees, these are relatively weak spots on the tree and often break. This is how the secondary infections enter, often disguising the S. musiva origins. <b>Cankers</b> are often colored around the edges and sunken in the branch itself. The tissue will become very dry and brittle, turn dark brown/black and sometimes form a lesion on the leaf. There can be fruiting bodies found on some <b>cankers,</b> {{but it is important}} to note that thee sare only found in the disease's first year.|$|R
50|$|On twigs, {{branches}} and trunks B. obtusa can infect {{where there has}} been a winter injury or fire blight <b>cankers.</b> Slightly sunken reddish/brown spots appear on the infected areas of bark. These then enlarge to form <b>cankers,</b> which can then enlarge slightly more each year. The bark usually dies and can, after time, be pulled away from the tree. In older <b>cankers</b> the pycnidia appear on the bark.|$|R
40|$|Botryosphaeria spp. {{recently}} {{have been identified}} as important grapevine pathogens worldwide. To date, Botryosphaeria rhodina has been the only species associated with <b>cankers</b> on Vitis vinifera in California. A field survey of 166 vineyards in 21 counties was conducted {{in order to determine the}} occurrence of other Botryosphaeria spp. in California. In all, 1, 735 samples of <b>cankered</b> trunks, cordons, and spurs were collected. Botryosphaeria spp. were the most common fungi isolated from grapevine <b>cankers</b> in California. Morphological identification along with phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and a partial sequence of the beta-tubulin gene showed that at least seven Botryosphaeria spp. occur on grapevines in California: B. australis, B. dothidea, B. lutea, B. obtusa, B. parva, B. rhodina, and B. stevensii. Botryosphaeria spp. were found in grapevine <b>cankers</b> in all grape-growing regions surveyed in California, whereas incidence and distribution varied with location. Grapevine <b>cankers</b> in California have been associated mainly with Eutypa dieback. However, the frequent recovery of Botryosphaeria spp. from <b>cankers</b> in this study indicates that the role of these fungi in grapevine health needs to be more carefully considered...|$|R
5|$|The parsnip {{is usually}} cooked, {{but can also}} be eaten raw. It is high in {{vitamins}} and minerals, especially potassium. It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. It can be cultivated in deep, stone-free soils. It is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, viruses, and fungal diseases, of which <b>canker</b> is the most serious. Handling the stems and foliage can cause a skin rash if the skin is exposed to sunlight after handling.|$|E
5|$|Irene {{also caused}} severe {{agricultural}} damage in southeastern Florida totalling to $338million Floodwaters killed 30cattle at one farm, though the owners protected {{the rest of}} their 1700cattle by raising the feeding areas above the flood plain. According to an initial estimate, the flooding destroyed between 5% and 15% of fruit groves along its path. The flooding delayed the winter planting of corn and bell peppers and damaged tomato plants, forcing Miami-Dade County growers to replant damaged crops. The hurricane also damaged sugar cane, vegetables, and citrus crops, with citrus <b>canker</b> spreading after the storm passed through the area. Due to the crop damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared Broward, Collier, Miami-Dade, and Monroe Counties as disaster areas. This qualified eligible farmers for low-interest emergency loans.|$|E
5|$|Urnula craterium is {{a species}} of cup fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. It is {{parasitic}} on oak and various other hardwood species; it is also saprobic, as the fruit bodies develop on dead wood after it has fallen to the ground. Appearing in early spring, its distinctive goblet-shaped and dark-colored fruit bodies have earned it the common names devil's urn and the gray urn. The distribution of U.craterium includes eastern North America, Europe, and Asia. It produces bioactive compounds that can inhibit the growth of other fungi. The asexual (imperfect), or conidial stage of U.craterium is a plant pathogen known as Conoplea globosa, which causes a <b>canker</b> disease of oak and several other hardwood tree species.|$|E
5000|$|... "All-American intercrosses" [...] {{defines the}} {{breeding}} {{strategy of the}} ACCF; John Rush Elkins, a research chemist and professor emeritus of chemistry at Concord University, and Gary Griffin, professor of plant pathology at Virginia Tech, {{think there may be}} several different characteristics which favor blight resistance. By making intercrosses among resistant American chestnuts from many locations, they expect to improve upon the levels of blight resistance to make an American chestnut that can compete in the forest. Griffin developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically. He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the <b>cankers.</b> Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken <b>cankers</b> that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood. Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen <b>cankers</b> that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these <b>cankers.</b> The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of <b>cankers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Biological {{control of}} plant {{diseases}} generally requires release of living organisms into the environment. Cryphonectria hypoviruses function as biological control agents for the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, and hypovirus-infected C. parasitica strains {{can be used}} to treat infected trees. We used naturally occurring molecular marker polymorphisms to examine the persistence and dissemination of the three genomes of a hypovirus-infected C. parasitica strain, namely, the double-stranded RNA genome of Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 (CHV 1) and the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of its fungal host. The hypovirus-infected strain was experimentally introduced into a blight-infested chestnut coppice forest by treating 73 of 246 chestnut blight <b>cankers.</b> Two years after introduction, the hypovirus had disseminated to 36 % of the untreated <b>cankers</b> and to 35 % of the newly established <b>cankers.</b> Spread of the hypovirus was more frequent within treated sprout clusters than between sprout clusters. Mitochondrial DNA of the introduced fungus also was transferred into the resident C. parasitica population. Concomitant transfer of both the introduced hypovirus and mitochondrial DNA was detected in almost one-half of the treated <b>cankers</b> analyzed. The introduced mitochondrial DNA haplotype also was found in three resident isolates from newly established <b>cankers.</b> The nuclear genome of the introduced strain persisted in the treated <b>cankers</b> but did not spread beyond them...|$|R

5|$|Banksia verticillata {{has been}} {{declared}} vulnerable under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial <b>canker,</b> frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is spraying with phosphite, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} Walpole. Used successfully on B.brownii but as yet untrialled with B.verticillata, phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{focused his}} {{attention}} on Indians while in South Africa. He {{was not interested in}} politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a parasite, semi-barbarous, <b>canker,</b> squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.|$|E
5|$|Dying {{stands of}} B. coccinea were {{observed}} in 1989, and the fungus Cryptodiaporthe melanocraspedia isolated as the cause in 1995. The disease, a form of aerial <b>canker,</b> manifested initially as dead dry brown leaves and the tips of new growth. Plants would die from the top downwards, with larger branches affected over time. Under the outer bark, orange and brown patches of necrosis spread out from leaf nodes until they encircle the stem, which then dies. Flower spikes may be affected during flowering season. In humid spells during warm weather, white or pink spore tendrils are produced on dead wood. One affected stand monitored over three years from October 1989 to June 1992 showed a 97% mortality of plants (compared with a baseline 40%). Investigators Bryan Shearer and colleagues isolated another virulent pathogen that they identified as a species of Zythiostroma, however it appeared to invoke an immune response in the plant. This immune response, coupled {{with the fact that}} it had not been observed in the wild, led them to believe it was not a major pathogen of the species. This species has since been reclassified and named as Luteocirrhus shearii.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{mistaken for}} frost damage, the disease manifests in early spring, wilting new leaves and causing mature leaves to turn brown along the veins. Infected leaves {{typically}} shrivel and fall, {{so that by}} summer the tree is regrowing its foliage. <b>Cankers</b> form on twigs and branches near infected leaves, serving to spread the disease by spore production and also weakening the tree. Because <b>cankers</b> restrict the flow of nutrients, twigs and branches afflicted by <b>cankers</b> eventually die. Witch's broom is a symptom reflecting the cycle of twigs dying.|$|R

40|$|In July 2014, an {{outbreak}} of stem and shoot <b>cankers</b> was observed in mango experimental plots in Jeju, Korea. Initial disease symptoms were dark or reddish brown stem and shoot <b>cankers</b> on branches and leaves. Dieback symptoms followed in the areas above the lesions, progressing to development of numerous small white-brown pycnidia. The causative agent was initially identified as Phomopsis fukushii based on morphological characteristics, colony appearance, and shape of alpha and beta conidia of isolates recovered from <b>cankers.</b> Further confirmation was obtained by assessment of DNA sequences of internal transcribed spacer regions and translation elongation factor and actin genes...|$|R
50|$|The most {{striking}} symptom of infection includes <b>cankers</b> {{located on the}} main trunk, branch crotches, scaffold limbs, and older branches. A symptom called “flagging” {{can be found on}} necrotic scaffold limbs. The <b>cankers</b> are parallel to the long axis of the stem and take on an oval shape. Normally, large-scale production of amber colored gum marks the first external symptom of such <b>cankers.</b> While gum production is the typical plant response to irritation, the gum secretion of Leucostoma occurs in bulk amounts. This gum darkens as time passes, gradually leading to the drying and cracking of bark; thus exposing the blackened tissue below.|$|R
