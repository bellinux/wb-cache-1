This led to a <b>carrier</b> <b>current</b> station known as [...] "WRSM" [...] signing on in January 1948 at 600 kHz. This station, run by students and volunteers, was authorized by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and was affiliated with the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System.

40|$|This paper updates prior {{research}} on aircraft leasing and contrasts {{the findings of}} current data with prior results. Usage of leases by air carriers is a means to lessen the impact of financial obligations from fleet purchases. The study revisits two previous studies, one in 1969 and one in 1991, which is analyzed the incidence of leases by major air <b>carriers.</b> The <b>current</b> study updates these past studies to consider air <b>carriers</b> <b>current</b> usage of leases. Additionally, since operating leases are not reflected in the balance sheets of airlines, operating lease information was capitalized using a present value of future operating lease payments. Then, financial debt burden ratios were computed to determine the impact from the capitalization of lease information. The usage of operating leases increased, significantly from the first study to the 1991 study, and this trend continues. The incidence of leasing, the classification of leases as operating, {{and the percentage of}} operating leases to total fleet have all increased {{for the majority of the}} airlines reviewed. When operating lease data were capitalized, debt ratios weakened, providing further evidence of deterioration in the financial health of air carriers...|$|R

40|$|The book {{presents}} a comprehensive {{survey of the}} thermoballistic approach to charge carrier transport in semiconductors. This semi-classical approach, which the authors have developed over the past decade, bridges {{the gap between the}} opposing drift-diffusion and ballistic  models of carrier transport. While incorporating basic features of the latter two models, the physical concept underlying the thermoballistic approach constitutes a novel, unifying scheme. It is based on the introduction of "ballistic configurations" arising from a random partitioning of the length of a semiconducting sample into ballistic transport intervals. Stochastic averaging of the ballistic <b>carrier</b> <b>currents</b> over the ballistic configurations results in a position-dependent thermoballistic current, which is the key element of the thermoballistic concept and forms  the point of departure for the calculation of all relevant transport properties. In the book, the thermoballistic concept and its implementation are developed in great detail, and specific examples of interest to current research in semiconductor physics and spintronics are worked out...|$|R
