5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, prenylated {{proteins}} are proteins with covalently attached hydrophobic isoprene polymers (i.e. branched five-carbon hydrocarbon) at cysteine residues of the protein.

40|$|AbstractThe Saccharomyces cerevisiae a-mating pheromones are 12 {{amino acid}} lipopeptides whose {{secretion}} {{is dependent on}} the ABC transporter, Ste 6 p. The pheromones are synthesized as 36 and 38 amino acid precursors that terminate in a <b>CaaX</b> <b>box</b> (C is Cys, a is an aliphatic residue, and X is the C-terminal amino acid). Posttranslational processing of the a-factor precursors includes at least 5 events. C-terminal processing of the <b>CaaX</b> <b>box</b> includes farnesylation of Cys, removal of the -aaX residues, and methylation of the cysteine α-carboxyl group. The N-terminal steps involve proteolytic cleavages that remove the prosequences. In this report, we have investigated the role of posttranslational modification in the generation of functional a-factor. Wild type, mutant and chimeric forms of a-factor have been expressed in yeast and assessed for their abilities to serve as sources of functional a-factor. We have found that although modification of the <b>CaaX</b> <b>box</b> is necessary, it is not sufficient to generate bioactive a-factor. The amino terminal prosequences are also required. Deletion of these sequences reduces intracellular levels of a-factor resulting in sterility. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) -a-factor fusions undergo <b>CaaX</b> <b>box</b> processing and membrane localization, but are not substrates for the N-terminal proteases and fail to interact with Ste 6 p.

To define signalling functions of G gamma subunits (STE 18 gene product) involved in pheromone response and mating in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated and characterized dominant-negative STE 18 alleles. We obtained dominant-negative mutations that disrupt C-terminal sequences required for prenylation of G gamma precursors (<b>CAAX</b> <b>box)</b> and that affect residues in the N-terminal half of Ste 18 p. Overexpression of mutant G gamma subunits in wild-type cells blocked signal transduction; this effect was suppressed upon overexpression of G beta subunits. Mutant G gamma subunits may therefore sequester G beta subunits into nonproductive G beta gamma dimers. Because mutant G gamma subunits blocked the constitutive signal resulting from {{disruption of the}} G alpha subunit gene (GPA 1), they are defective in functions required for downstream signalling. Ste 18 p bearing a C 107 Y substitution in the <b>CAAX</b> <b>box</b> displayed reduced electrophoretic mobility, consistent with a prenylation defect. G gamma subunits carrying N-terminal substitutions had normal electrophoretic mobilities, suggesting that these proteins were prenylated.

Ubiquitination has long been demonstrated to regulate the fate of numerous cellular proteins and recently it has become apparent that many GTPases, along with their GAPs, GeFs and GDis, undergo ubiquitination leading to a variety of fates such as re-localization or degradation. in this review we focus on the recent literature demonstrating that the regulation of small GTPases by ubiquitination, either directly or indirectly, plays a considerable role in controlling their function and that targeting these modifications could be important for disease treatment...|$|E
40|$|The C-terminus {{of nuclear}} lamins (CXXM) resembles a C-terminal motif (the <b>CAAX</b> <b>box)</b> of fungal mating factors and ras-related proteins.

By peptide mapping we show that both chicken lamins A and B 2 are processed proteolytically in vivo. However, whereas the entire CXXM motif is cleaved from lamin A, at most three C-terminal amino acids are removed from lamin B 2. Following translation of cDNA-derived RNAs in reticulocyte lysates, lamin proteins specifically incorporate a derivative of [14 C]mevalonic acid (MV), i. e. the precursor of a putative isoprenoid modification. Remarkably, no MV is incorporated into lamin B 2 translated from a mutant cDNA encoding alanine instead of cysteine in the C-terminal CXXM motif. These results implicate this particular cysteine residue as the target for modification of lamin proteins by an isoprenoid MV derivative, and they indicate that isoprenylation is amenable to studies in cell-free systems. Moreover, our observations suggest that C-terminal processing of newly synthesized nuclear lamins is a multi-step process highly reminiscent of the pathway elaborated recently for ras-related proteins...|$|E

In the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, the STE 18 gene (ORF 19. 6551. 1) encodes a potential subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein; this protein contains the C-terminal <b>CAAX</b> <b>box</b> characteristic of subunits and has sequence similarity to subunits implicated in the mating pathways of a variety of fungi. Disruption of this gene was shown to cause sterility ofMTLa mating cells and to block pheromone-induced gene expression and shmoo formation; deletion of just the <b>CAAX</b> <b>box</b> residues is sufficient to inactivate Ste 18 function in the mating process. Intriguingly, ectopic ex-pression behind the strong ACT 1 promoter of either the G or the G subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein is able to suppress the mating defect caused by deletion of the G subunit and restore both pheromone-induced gene expression andmorphology changes. HeterotrimericG protein-mediated signal transduction is ubiqui-tous and regulatesmany critical processes in eukaryotic cells (for a review, see reference 1).

40|$|The {{conversion}} of mammalian prelamin A to mature lamin A proceeds through {{the removal of}} 18 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus. The initial step in this processing is the isoprenylation of a <b>CAAX</b> <b>box</b> cysteine. This proteolytic event is distinctive for prelamin A among the known prenylated mammalian proteins. Since the carboxyl terminus of prelamin A is removed during maturation, it is not obvious that this protein would undergo the two reactions subsequent to prenylation observed in other <b>CAAX</b> <b>box</b> proteins-the endoproteolytic removal of the carboxyl-terminal 3 amino acids and the subsequent methylation of the now carboxyl-terminal cysteine. To characterize the maturation of prelamin A further, we have developed a CHO-K 1 cell line that possesses a dexamethasone-inducible human prelamin A against a genetic background of high mevalonate uptake. Utilizing this cell line in association with antibodies specific to the transgenic prelamin A, {{we have been able}} to demonstrate directly in vivo that prelamin A undergoes farnesylation and carboxymethylation prior to conversion to lamin A, as is the case for other prenylated proteins. We have demonstrated previously that in the absence of isoprenylation, {{conversion of}} prelamin A to lamin A is blocked, but that unprocessed prelamin A is transported to the nucleus where it can still undergo maturation. Consistent with the implications of these prior studies, we now demonstrate the presence of both subunits of farnesyl-protein transferase in the nucleus...|$|E
40|$|Pathogenic Yersinia strains {{evade the}} innate immune {{responses}} of the host by producing effector proteins (Yersinia outer proteins [Yops]), which are directly injected into mammalian cells by a type III secretion system (TTSS). One of these effector proteins (YopT) disrupts the actin cytoskeleton of the host cell resulting in cell rounding. YopT is a cysteine protease that cleaves Rho proteins directly upstream of the post-translationally modified cysteine. Thereby, it releases the GTPases from the membrane leading to inactivation. Small GTPases are modified by isoprenylation of the cysteine of the <b>CAAX</b> <b>box,</b> cleavage of the –AAX tripeptide, and methylation of the cysteine. We have shown that isoprenylation and the endoproteolytic cleavage of the tripeptide of Rho GTPases are essential for YopT-induced cleavage, whereas carboxyl methylation is not required. In the present study, we post-translationally modified RhoA, Rac, Cdc 42, and several mutants in vitro and characterized the YopT-induced cleavage with recombinant YopT. We show that farnesylated RhoA is a preferred substrate of YopT compared with the geranylgeranylated GTPase. Geranylgeranylated RhoA, however, is the preferred substrate for YopT-catalyzed cleavage with a threefold faster turnover rate over Rac and Cdc 42. Moreover, our data indicate that {{the composition of the}} polybasic region of the GTPases defines the specificity and efficiency of the YopT-induced cleavage, and that a space between the polybasic stretch of amino acids at the C terminus and the <b>CAAX</b> <b>box</b> enhances the turnover rate of YopT-catalyzed cleavage...|$|E
40|$|Subcellular {{localization}} of Ras proteins to {{the plasma}} membrane is accomplished {{in part by}} covalent attachment of a farnesyl moiety to the conserved <b>CaaX</b> <b>box</b> cysteine. Farnesylation targets Ras to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where additional processing steps occur, resulting in translocation of Ras to the plasma membrane. The mechanism(s) by which this occurs is not well understood. In this report, we show that plasma membrane localization of Ras 2 p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{does not require the}} classical secretory pathway or a functional Golgi apparatus. However, when the classical secretory pathway is disrupted, plasma membrane localization requires Erf 2 p, a protein that resides in the ER membrane and is required for efficient palmitoylation of Ras 2 p. Deletion of ERF 2 results in a Ras 2 p steady-state localization defect that is more severe when combined with sec-ts mutants or brefeldin A treatment. The Erf 2 p-dependent localization of Ras 2 p correlates with the palmitoylation of Cys- 318. An Erf 2 p-Erf 4 p complex has recently been shown to be an ER-associated palmitoyltransferase that can palmitoylate Cys- 318 of Ras 2 p (S. Lobo, W. K. Greentree, M. E. Linder, and R. J. Deschenes, J. Biol. Chem. 277 : 41268 - 41273, 2002). Erf 2 -dependent palmitoylation as well as localization of Ras 2 p requires a region of the hypervariable domain adjacent to the <b>CaaX</b> <b>box.</b> These results provide evidence for the existence of a palmitoylation-dependent, nonclassical endomembrane trafficking system for the plasma membrane localization of Ras proteins...|$|E

Amino acid sequences unique to each MRAS protein occur adjacent to the <b>CAAX</b> <b>box,</b> consistent with the location of the hypervariable region in other ras proteins.

Gene-specific probes for two of these genes, MRAS 1 and MRAS 3, hybridized to different 1. 3 -kb mRNA transcripts. The accumulation of these transcripts depended on the developmental stage, and this pattern was different between the two MRAS genes.

These modifications are closely coupled in vivo. However, {{in vitro translation}} of mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates produces p 21 K-ras(B) proteins which are arrested in processing after farnesylation. Intracellular membranes are then required both for proteolytic removal of the AAX amino acids and methylesterification of farnesylated p 21 K-ras(B). Binding of p 21 K-ras(B) to plasma membranes in vitro can then be shown to depend critically on AAX proteolysis and methylesterification since p 21 K-ras(B) which is farnesylated, but not methylated, binds inefficiently to membranes...|$|E

The absence of the rab protein in the docking complex suggests that, in a broad sense, rab proteins participate in a reaction catalyzing SNARE complex assembly. In so doing, rab proteins could help impart an additional layer of specificity to vesicle docking. This mechanism likely involves the Secl homolog Slyl, which we identified in isolated docking complexes. We also report the identification of a novel V-SNARE (YktGp) component of the yeast ER-Golgi docking complex that has a <b>CAAX</b> <b>box</b> and is predicted to be lipid anchored. The surprising finding that docking complexes can contain many distinct species of SNARES (SedSp, Boslp, Sec 22 p, YktGp, and likely Betlp, ~ 28, and ~ 14) suggests that multimeric interactions are features of the fusion machinery, and may also improve the fidelity of vesicle targeting...|$|E

We now show that Ykt 6 is released efficiently from vacuoles during an early stage of yeast vacuole fusion. This release is dependent on the disassembly of vacuolar SNAREs (priming).

In agreement with this, we find that yeast Ykt 6 becomes palmitoylated in vitro at its C-terminal CAAX motif. Mutagenesis of the potential palmitoylation site in yeast Ykt 6 prevents stable membrane association and is lethal. On the basis of these and other findings, we speculate that Ykt 6 is released from membranes by depalmitoylation.

Surprisingly, binding and suppression of prion domain toxicity by Ydj 1 was dependent upon farnesylation of its C-terminal <b>CAAX</b> <b>box</b> and action of a zinc finger-like region. In contrast, folding of luciferase was independent of farnesylation, yet required the zinc finger-like region of Ydj 1 and a conserved hydrophobic peptide-binding pocket. Type I Hsp 40 s contain at least three different domains that work in concert to bind different protein conformers. The combined action of a farnesyl moiety and zinc finger-like region enable Type I Hsp 40 s to recognize amyloid-like substrates and prevent formation of cytotoxic protein species...|$|E
40|$|Meiotic lamin C 2 is {{the only}} A-type lamin {{expressed}} during mammalian spermatogenesis. Typical for this short lamin is the unique hexapeptide GNAEGR, which substitutes the nonhelical amino terminus {{and part of the}} α-helical rod domain present in somatic lamins. Meiotic lamin C 2 also lacks a carboxyl-terminal <b>CaaX</b> <b>box,</b> which is modified by isoprenylation and involved in nuclear envelope (NE) association of somatic isoforms. The mechanism by which lamin C 2 becomes localized in the NE is totally unknown. Here we demonstrate that the hexapeptide GNAEGR is essential for this process: (i) Its deletion resulted in a diffuse distribution of lamin C 2 within nuclei of transfected COS- 7 cells; (ii) Mutated somatic lamin C, containing the sequence GNAEGR at its amino terminus, was located at the NE. The mass spectrometric analysis of the amino terminus of lamin C 2 revealed that it is modified by myristoylation. Correspondingly, the substitution of the first glycine residue abolishes the NE association of lamin C 2. We conclude that NE association of lamin C 2 is achieved by a mechanism different from that of somatic lamins...|$|E
40|$|Phenotypically normal revertants of {{budding yeast}} cells that contain the hyperactive RAS 2 Val 19 allele often result from second-site {{mutations}} within the RAS 2 locus itself. Several such intragenic revertants harboring a suppressed RAS 2 Val 19 allele as their only RAS gene were analyzed. All such suppressors resulted from single amino acid substitutions that affected either: (i) the effector region of Ras 2, (ii) the C-terminal <b>CAAX</b> <b>box</b> of Ras 2, or (iii) residues {{known to be}} critical for GTP binding in Ras proteins. While these suppressor mutations completely suppressed the hyperactive phenotype induced by the Val 19 substitution, they did not block the ability of Ras 2 to promote growth at normal temperatures. These results suggest that in yeast, attenuation of Ras proteins can effectively block hyperactive phenotypes without completely blocking the growth-promoting function. A spontaneous intragenic mutation that restored function to an effector mutant was mapped to a 'nonessential' region of Ras proteins. Based on this genetic interaction with the effector region and the report that deletions of this region affect Ras/GAP interaction, we suggest that this region may have a functional role in Ras activation of target effectors...|$|E
