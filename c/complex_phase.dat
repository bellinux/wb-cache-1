25|$|Crystal {{structure}} {{can also}} be investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), also known as phase contrast. When using a field emission source and a specimen of uniform thickness, the images are formed {{due to differences in}} phase of electron waves, which is caused by specimen interaction. Image formation is given by the complex modulus of the incoming electron beams. As such, the image is not only dependent on the number of electrons hitting the screen, making direct interpretation of phase contrast images more complex. However this effect can be used to an advantage, as it can be manipulated to provide more information about the sample, such as in <b>complex</b> <b>phase</b> retrieval techniques.|$|E

40|$|We {{find the}} light-cone wavefunction {{representations}} of the Sivers and Boer-Mulders distribution functions. A necessary condition {{for the existence of}} these representations is that the light-cone wavefunctions have <b>complex</b> <b>phases.</b> We induce the <b>complex</b> <b>phases</b> by incorporating the final-state interactions into the light-cone wavefunctions. For the scalar and axial-vector diquark models for nucleon, we calculate explicitly the Sivers and Boer-Mulders distribution functions from the light-cone wavefunction representations. We obtain the results that the Sivers distribution function has the opposite signs with the factor 3 difference in magnitude for the two models, whereas the Boer-Mulders distribution function has the same sign and magnitude. We can understand these results from the properties of the light-cone wavefunction {{representations of the}} Sivers and Boer-Mulders distribution functions. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Artificially {{prepared}} sediments {{were used}} to assess the effects of sediment composition on inorganic Hg partitioning, speciation and bioavailability. Organic coating in sediment greatly increased the Hg partitioning and the amount of bioavailable Hg bound with the clay and the Fe and Mn oxides, but had little effect on that bound with the quartz and calcium carbonate as a result of weaker binding of humic acids and fulvic acids. The clay content increased the concentration of Hg in the sediments but inhibited the gut juice extraction due to the strong binding of Hg-organic matter (OM) complexes. Most Hg in the sediments was complexed by OM (mainly distributed in the organo-complexed phase and the strongly <b>complexed</b> <b>phase),</b> and the Hg-OM complexes (especially Hg in the strongly <b>complexed</b> <b>phase)</b> in sediments contributed much to gut juice extraction. Redistribution of Hg-OM complexes between sediments and gut juices may occur during gut juice extraction and modify Hg bioavailability and speciation in sediments. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

For off diagonal NSI elements there could be <b>complex</b> <b>phases</b> ϕ_ij which could also lead to CP violation.
