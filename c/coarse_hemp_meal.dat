40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{fractionation}} of protein from hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) meal {{according to their}} solubility of the hemp varieties - Fedora 17 and Uso 31. The content of nitrogenous substances and protein content in the <b>hemp</b> <b>meal</b> of these studied varieties ranged from 23, 6 % (Uso 31) to 31, 5 % (Fedora 17) and from 100, 1 mg. g- 1 (Uso 31) to 130, 7 mg. g- 1 respectively. The fractionation of hemp protein (Fedora 17, Uso 31) confirmed that the main hemp protein fraction is an albumin fraction, with its relative abundance - 20, 5 % of protein. As a next step, the spectra of hemp proteins were determined. The use SDS-PAGE analysis revealed albumin proteins in area of 7, 4 53, 6 kDa. In the globulin fraction was revealed by SDS-PAGE basic subunits of the major protein edestin in the area 19 - 21 kDa and acidic subunits in the area 34 kDa...|$|R
40|$|Hemp (Cannabis sativa) is a {{traditional}} oil and fiber crop. Its use is universal. Hemp seeds have been consumed in history as a nutritious food. The aim of this work is to summarize information about the nutritional quality of hemp seeds (base composition, amino acid, fibre, vitamin, specific substances content, etc.), technological quality parameters (TGW, the yield of hulled seeds), possibilities of processing and hemp seed {{products on the market}} [...] Hemp seed contains about 25 - 35 % oil that is rich in linoleic and linolenic acids, 20 - 25 % easily digestible protein, 10 - 15 % saccharides mainly as fibre, vitamins A, B 1, B 2, B 6, C and E. Basic processing techniques of hemp seeds include size separation and hulling. The yield of hulled hemp seeds can be higher as 75 %. The hemp oil for food industry is produced by cold pressing. Rests after seed oil pressing (seed cake) are suitable for production of hemp-meal. In the Czech Republic, a whole range of hemp products are sold e. g. hulled hemp seeds, chocolate with hemp seeds, yogurt with hemp seeds, <b>hemp</b> oil, <b>hemp</b> <b>meal,</b> pasta, wine, beer, spice, and others...|$|R
40|$|This {{report shows}} the {{antioxidant}} {{effects of a}} <b>hemp</b> seed <b>meal</b> protein hydrolysate (HMH) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Defatted <b>hemp</b> seed <b>meal</b> was hydrolyzed consecutively with pepsin and pancreatin to yield HMH, which was incorporated into rat feed {{as a source of}} antioxidant peptides. Young (8 -week old) SHRs were divided into three groups (8 rats/group) and fed diets that contained 0. 0 %, 0. 5 % or 1. 0 % (w/w) HMH for eight weeks; half of the rats were sacrificed for blood collection. After a 4 -week washout period, the remaining 20 -week old SHRs were fed for an additional four weeks and sacrificed for blood collection. Plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and total peroxides (TPx) levels were determined. Results showed that plasma TAC, CAT and SOD levels decreased in the older 20 -week old SHRs when compared to the young SHRs. The presence of HMH in the diets led to significant (p < 0. 05) increases in plasma SOD and CAT levels in both young and adult SHR groups; these increases were accompanied by decreases in TPx levels. The results suggest that HMH contained antioxidant peptides that reduced the rate of lipid peroxidation in SHRs with enhanced antioxidant enzyme levels and total antioxidant capacity...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{foods and}} nutraceuticals are of special importance, {{particularly}} for {{their impact on}} human health and prevention of certain chronic diseases. Consequently, the production and properties of bioactive peptides have received an increasing scientific interest over past few years. Present work intends to compare the competence of metalloendopeptidases (“Protease N” and “Protease A”) with papain for getting functional peptides from <b>hemp</b> seed <b>meal,</b> which is an obligatory waste of hemp fiber production industry. As {{a measure of the}} functional potential hemp protein hydrolysates were analyzed for their antiradical properties in DPPH system. “Protease N” modified protein hydrolysate exhibited comparatively superior radical scavenging activity in DPPH system. Overall findings represent the importance of “Protease N,” as endopeptidase in getting peptides of good antiradical properties from various protein sources...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Prior {{studies have}} been {{performed}} on cotton textile plants throughout the world. This study was planned to identify the rate of byssinosis and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) in hemp and jute workers and those who worked with both of them. Material and Methods: The study was realized in a factory which consecutively processed hemp and jute. The study enrollment included 266 people, 164 of whom were active workers and 102 were retired. A questionnaire, plain chest X-rays, physical examination and pulmonary function tests were performed. Dust levels were measured in various sections of the factory during 8 h work shifts. Endotoxin levels of various quality hemp fibers and dusts were measured. Results: The rate of byssinosis (28. 2 %) was higher among the workers that who exposed to both jute and hemp dust. The frequency of chronic bronchitis in retired workers who previously smoked was higher (20 %) as compared to currently smoking workers (17 %). High dust levels were measured {{in some parts of the}} factory (mean (M) = 2. 69 mg/m 3). Working in dense dust areas, active smoking, being older than 40 years of age, being an ex-smoker, and working in the factory for a period exceeding 15 years were significantly associated with bronchitis and emphysema development. High endotoxin levels were determined for fine hemp dust (605 EU/mg), <b>coarse</b> <b>hemp</b> dust (336 EU/mg) and poor quality hemp fibers (114 EU/mg), whereas in fresh hemp stalks the level of endotoxin was determined to be lower (0. 27 EU/mg). Conclusions: Because of high exposures to jute and hemp dusts that are associated with high byssinosis rates, personal protection and environmental hygiene is crucial to prevention of byssinosis...|$|R
40|$|Hemp (Cannabis sativa) is annual {{plant that}} {{is native to}} China and {{remained}} as important material for food, industrial  and medical purposes. As source of cannabinoids belongs to controversial, but due to its excellent nutritional profile, non-gluten protein, fat and fibre it has potential in bakery products. Addition of 5 % - 20 % of hemp press cake fine flour and fine wholemeal significantly increased dietary fibre content, but their influence on volume of laboratory baked bread was different. Reflecting actual dosage, both types of hemp press cake flour diminished bun sizes about 6 % - 33 %; volumes of bread containing hulled wholemeal were comparable to standard (mean 310 mL/ 100  g vs. 333  ml/ 100  g, respectively. Only dehulled wholemeal hemp form increased the bread specific volume (6 % - 30 %), especially as 10 % fortification (434  mL/ 100  g). Six Canadian hemp products were added as 10 % and 20 % on wheat flour base, comprising fine <b>hemp</b> flour and <b>coarse</b> <b>hemp</b> powder, dehulled whole seeds, hulled hemp seeds with sea salt as well as 50 % and 43 % hemp protein concentrates (KP 1 -KP 6, respectively). The higher level of KP 1, KP 2, KP 5 and KP 6, the lower bread specific volumes were determined (decrease about 9 % - 48 %). Soft increase in buns size caused by 10 % and 20 % KP 3 (323 and 319  ml/ 100  g vs. 296  mL/ 100  g) was insignificant. The effect of KP 4 was reversely verifiable, magnifying the parameter about 25 % and 17 %, respectively. In terms of protein content in bread, a level 11. 75 % in wheat bread has risen to approx. 14. 5 % and 18. 0 % when 10 % and 20 % of KP 3 and KP 5, respectively, was included into bread recipe. All six Canadian hemp products increased dietary fibre content in bread, mainly owing to KP 4 and both protein concentrates (up to 4 and 3 times, respectively). Incorporation of hemp flour up {{to the level of}} 10 % positively affected bread sensorial properties. <! [...] [endif] [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|A 1914 USDA report noted: Hemp is {{cultivated}} {{throughout the}} greater part of Russia, and {{it is one of the}} principal crops in the provinces of Orel, Kursk, Samara, Smolensk, Tula, Voronezh, and Poland. Two distinct types, similar to the tall fiber hemp and the short oilseed hemp of Manchuria, are cultivated, and there are doubtless many local varieties in isolated districts where there is a little interchange of seed. The crop is rather crudely cultivated, with no attempt at seed selection or improvement, and the plants are generally shorter and <b>coarser</b> than the <b>hemp</b> grown in Kentucky. The short oilseed hemp with slender stems, about 30 inches high, bearing compact clusters of seeds and maturing in 60 to 90 days, is of little value for fiber production, but the experimental plants, grown from seed imported from Russia, indicate that it may be valuable as an oil-seed crop to be harvested and thrashed in the same manner as oilseed flax.|$|R
40|$|In {{a context}} of a strong demand for {{vegetable}} oils, {{the development of new}} “green” processes is essential to provide methods that avoid the use of organic solvents, work at relatively low temperatures and preserve the quality of the final products. The supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) process meets these objectives. In this study, five <b>meals</b> (<b>hemp,</b> flax, sesame, poppy and walnut) were subjected to SFE at 45 °C and 250 bar in the presence of ethanol as co-solvent. Using this method, between 77 and 98 % of the lipids present in the meal could be extracted. Except for poppy, 50 % of the lipids present in the cake were recovered as a separate oily liquid phase. SFE was not selective toward certain types of triglycerides: the oils obtained exhibited the same fatty acid profile than the total lipid extracts from the cakes. In contrast, the composition in minor lipid components was dependent on the type of meal investigated. For example, hemp lipid extract was particularly rich in chlorophyll...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecological}} value of engineered marine structures {{can be enhanced}} by building-in additional habitat complexity. Pre-fabricated habitat units can be cheaply and easily cast from concrete into heterogeneous three-dimensional shapes and surface topographies, with proven ability to enhance biodiversity on artificial structures. The net ecological benefits of enhancement using concrete, however, may be compromised on account of its large environmental footprint and poor performance as substrate for many marine organisms. We carried out a pilot study to trial alternative cast-able ?Reefcrete? concrete mixes, with reduced environmental footprints, {{for use in the}} marine environment. We used partial replacement of Portland cement with recycled ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), and partial replacement of <b>coarse</b> aggregate with <b>hemp</b> fibres and recycled shell material. We calculated the estimated carbon footprint of each concrete blend and deployed replicate tiles in the intertidal environment for 12 months to assess their performance as substrate for marine biodiversity. The hemp and shell concrete blends had reduced carbon footprints compared to both ordinary Portland cement based concrete and the GGBS based control concrete used in this study. At the end of the experiment, the hemp and shell blends supported significantly more live cover than the standard GGBS control blend. Taxon richness, particularly of mobile fauna, was also higher on the hemp concrete than either the shell or GGBS control. Furthermore, the overall species pool recorded on the hemp concrete was much larger. Community compositions differed significantly on the hemp tiles, compared to GGBS controls. This was largely explained by higher abundances of several taxa, including canopy-forming algae, which may have facilitated other taxa. Our findings indicate that the alternative materials trialled in this study provided substrate of equal or better habitat suitability compared to ordinary GGBS based concrete. Given the growing interest in ecological engineering of marine infrastructure, we propose there would be great benefit in further development of these alternative ?Reefcrete? materials for wider applicationPeer reviewe...|$|R
