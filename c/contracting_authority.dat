2500|$|On October 16, 2007 the United States Department of Defense {{announced}} that it awarded contract N00033-08-C-5500 to Sealift Incorporated. [...] This was a $10,614,000 firm-fixed-price contract plus reimbursables for the Virginian. The ship was contracted to carry containers laden with ammunition to support {{the global war on}} terrorism and the United States Central Command. [...] The contract includes options, which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $39,814,000. [...] If options are exercised, work may continue through October 2011. [...] This contract was competitively procured via Federal Business Opportunities and the Military Sealift Command websites, with more than 200 proposals solicited and three offers received. [...] The U.S. Navy’s Military Sealift Command is the <b>contracting</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|E
60|$|Observe what monstrous {{consequences}} {{would result}} from a contrary position. A foreign enemy has entered, or a strong domestic one has arisen in the nation. In such events the circumstances may be, and often have been, such that a Parliament cannot sit. This was precisely the case in that rebellion in Ireland. It will be admitted also, that their power may be so great as {{to make it very}} prudent to treat with them, in order to save effusion of blood, perhaps to save the nation. Now could such a treaty be at all made, if your enemies, or rebels, were fully persuaded, that, in these times of confusion, there was no authority in the state which could hold out to them an inviolable pledge for their future security, but that there lurked in the Constitution a dormant, but irresistible power, who would not think itself bound by the ordinary subsisting and <b>contracting</b> <b>authority,</b> but might rescind its acts and obligations at pleasure? This would be a doctrine made to perpetuate and exasperate war; and on that principle it directly impugns the law of nations, which is built upon this principle, that war should be softened as much as possible, and that it should cease as soon as possible, between contending parties and communities. The king has a power to pardon individuals. If the king holds out his faith to a robber, to come in on a promise of pardon, of life and estate, and, in all respects, of a full indemnity, shall the Parliament say that he must nevertheless be executed, that his estate must be forfeited, or that he shall be abridged of any of the privileges which he before held as a subject? Nobody will affirm it. In such a case, the breach of faith would not only be {{on the part of the}} king who assented to such an act, but on the part of the Parliament who made it. As the king represents the whole contracting capacity of the nation, so far as his prerogative (unlimited, as I said before, by any precedent law) can extend, he acts as the national procurator on all such occasions. What is true of a robber is true of a rebel; and what is true of one robber or rebel is as true, and it is a much more important truth, of one hundred thousand.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the most {{frequent}} misconducts of <b>contracting</b> <b>authorities</b> in procurement process and also includes relating case law. However public procurement belongs to commercial law, its specific legislation makes it "sui generis". It means that public procurement in the Czech Republic is {{to a certain extent}} independent. Public procurement is also very emerging field of law. Since 1995, when the first comprehensive legislation came into force, <b>contracting</b> <b>authorities</b> had to become acquainted with 4 different legislations governing public procurement. It is already known, that in 2016 a new legislation governing public procurement will come into force.

The purpose of my thesis is to analyse the most frequent misconducts of <b>contracting</b> <b>authorities</b> in procurement process and introduce the procedure which should be govern by <b>contracting</b> <b>authorities</b> so they would proceed in accordance with the law.

50|$|The {{key to the}} {{implementation}} of Job Order Contracting during the initial development period is the fact that each of the District Engineers, organized under the Chief of Engineers, held a warrant as a contracting officer. The Directors of Engineering and Housing at the test installations were made ordering officers of the contract. This allowed the group to bypass the contracting community, an impediment at the time. This scheme did not go over well with the Assistant Secretary of the Army, John Shannon. Shannon was infuriated that the group was able to bypass the Army <b>contracting</b> <b>authority</b> and use the Corps of Engineers’ <b>contracting</b> <b>authority.</b> To illustrate how upset Shannon became: In one heated meeting, Shannon made several personal attacks against Mellon, demanding to know what his source of commission was, how he got into the Army, and why he was even in the meeting.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} {{bachelor}} paper – current legal problems in awarding public procurement contracts, being fully or partially excluded form ratione materiae of EU Public Procurement Directives – {{is related to}} actual practical concerns on effective functioning of Internal Market in field of public contracts.
