5|$|In fact, tadpoles {{developing}} in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous. Pond tadpoles {{tend to have}} deep bodies, large caudal fins and small mouths; they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation. Stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths, shallow bodies and caudal fins; they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria. They also feed on diatoms, filtered from the water through the gills, and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond, ingesting edible fragments. They have a relatively long, spiral-shaped gut {{to enable them to}} digest this diet. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles and fish. Young of the <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Osteopilus septentrionalis) can occasionally be cannibalistic, the younger tadpoles attacking a larger, more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis.|$|E
5|$|Slow-motion {{photography}} {{shows that}} the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog {{is still in the}} crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position {{for the duration of the}} jump. In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. When the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone. Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.|$|E
50|$|As {{excellent}} climbers, the <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> will typically sleep {{above ground}} during the day. During the night, they forage for insects around sources of artificial light. They will eat {{anything they can}} overpower and fits into their mouths, including snails, spiders, insects, other <b>frogs</b> (even other <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs),</b> snakes, lizards, small crustaceans, and hatchling birds in their nests. Their foraging will occasionally take them up utility poles, where they can cause short-circuits of utility switches, causing costly power outages.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> {{are sexually}} dimorphic - females {{are larger than}} males. Breeding males can be {{identified}} by their development of black nuptial pads on their thumbs, which help the males {{to hold onto the}} females during mating.|$|R

The red-footed {{tortoise}} (Chelonoidis carbonaria) is {{a species of}} tortoise found here, it somehow came from South America. Hurricanes led to over-water dispersal for the green iguanas (Iguana iguana) to colonise Anguilla. All three animals are introduced.|$|R
5|$|Frogs {{are much}} more vocal, {{especially}} during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E
50|$|In {{southern}} Florida, the <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Osteopilus septentrionalis) is an {{invasive species}} {{that has a}} similar call to the green tree frog in regards to timing and pitch. A study found that their calls compete acoustically with each other due to their similarity which limits communication space. In order {{to compete with the}} <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog,</b> green tree frogs modified their call to be shorter, louder, and more frequent so that potential mates have better chances of detecting the call.|$|E
50|$|The white-lipped tree frog (Litoria infrafrenata), {{also known}} as the giant tree frog, is the world's largest tree frog (the <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> reaches a similar maximum size). This species is native to the rainforests of Northern Queensland, New Guinea, the Bismarck Islands, and the Admiralty Islands.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> {{are known}} to inhabit a variety of habitats, {{including}} estuaries, low-density suburban development, small towns, agricultural areas, particularly ones with exotic plants, and lowland forests and swamps. Within their habitats, they {{can be found in}} damp, shady areas, particularly around shrubs and trees, by cisterns, rain barrels, and buildings.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> {{can change}} colors {{depending}} on their temperature and environment. Many individuals have darker splotches on the back, and some splotchy banding on the legs. In many individuals, the hidden surfaces of their legs are bright yellow. When the frog leaps to avoid a predator, these bright-yellow patches are visible, and may help to confuse the predator.Also, the skin on their heads is fused to the skull; if {{the head of an}} adult frog is rubbed (between the eyes), the skin does not move. This special adaptation prevents water loss, since fewer blood vessels occur in the [...] "co-ossified" [...] (fused) area. When handled, <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> secrete a toxic mucus from their skin. In humans, this can cause an allergic reaction or burning sensation to the eyes and nose, and even trigger asthma.|$|R
500|$|The {{leaves of}} Roystonea regia {{are used as}} {{roosting}} sites by Eumops floridanus, the Florida bonneted bat, and {{is used as a}} retreat for <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> (Osteopilus septentriolalis), a non-native species, in Florida. [...] In Panama (where R. regia is introduced), its trunks are used as nesting sites by yellow-crowned parrots (Amazona ochrocephala panamensis). [...] The flowers of R. regia are visited by pollen-collecting bees and are considered a good source of nectar. [...] Its pollen was also found in the stomachs of Phyllonycteris poeyi, the Cuban flower bat (a pollen-feeder) and Monophyllus redmani, Leach's single leaf bat (a nectar-feeder). [...] Artibeus jamaicensis, the Jamaican fruit bat, and Myiozetetes similis, the social flycatcher, feed on the fruit.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> ranges in {{size from}} 3 to 5.5 in in length. It is the largest tree frog in North America. It has a rough, warty skin. Its toepads are much larger than those of other tree frogs, and it often has an orange tint to its eyes. It varies in color from olive-brown or bronze to gray or grayish-white.|$|E
5000|$|One {{example of}} an animal species that has bred without limit is the <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Osteopilus septentrionalis). The <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> {{found its way to}} Florida after {{hitching}} a ride in shipping containers on trading boats and ships. As its name implies, the frog is native to Cuba. Florida's warm, rainy and humid weather is the perfect environment for the <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> to reproduce and breed. The only thing that seems to cause sharp declines in their populations are freezes, or unusually cold winters. These frogs have spread up and down the coast of Florida as well as around the central Florida area. They eat various types of insects and spiders, but are also cannibalistic and have caused the native Florida tree frog populations to decrease as they feed on them. [...] "Cuban Treefrogs are 'sit-and-wait' predators. On warm nights in Florida, it is common to encounter Cuban Treefrogs hanging on walls and windows near lighted areas as they sit and wait for insects (and native treefrogs) to be attracted to the lights. As they feed, they defecate on the windows and walls, and their fecal deposits can become unsightly over time, especially if {{there are a lot of}} frogs in the area. Furthermore, when a person enters or exits his or her home at night, Cuban Treefrogs that are waiting for an insect meal may be startled and as a result will occasionally jump onto people or into their homes through open doors.

50|$|<b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> breed year round, {{but most}} {{commonly}} {{in the wet}} season, between May and October. Optimal conditions {{are considered to be}} 81.5 F with high humidity (97.8%) and rain. They lay a partial clutch of eggs in varying size ranging from 100-1,000. The full clutch is on average a total of 3,961 and varies based on female body size. Eggs can hatch in under 30 hours and can fully develop in one month. Much like their adult counterparts, newly hatched tadpoles occur in a variety of colors and patterns. They have wide caudal fins and two rows of labial teeth on the top of their mouths and four rows on the bottom. Tadpoles survive on algae and will occasionally eat other tadpoles, and, on rare occasions, recently metamorphism juveniles. After transformation, they are between 0.55 and 0.67 in long, and their tails are entirely absorbed.|$|R
40|$|Frog jumping {{provides}} an excellent system for investigating the limits to muscle-powered accelerations. Frogs jump farther than they should, if we consider only the power their muscles are capable of producing. The mechanical power required to accelerate the body can be calculated from jump distance, or from high-speed video analysis, and the muscular power available can be determined from the well-known contractile properties of isolated frog muscle. Results from several studies indicate that these two quantities do not agree; the power transferred to the body during a maximal jump actually exceeds the power available from hindlimb muscles (Marsh and John-Alder, 1994; Peplowski and Marsh, 1997; Navas et al., 1999; Wilson et al., 2000). The discrepancy between muscle power-producing capacity and power output is dramatically illustrated if instantaneous power during the jump is calculated. In <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> (Osteopilus septentrionalis), peak instantaneous muscle powers are as much as seven times the power available from hindlimb muscles (Peplowski and Marsh, 1997). The supramaximal powers observed during jumping probably result from the rapid release of strain energy from elastic elements (Marsh, 1994, 1999). Elastic structures can operate as muscle power amplifiers {{because they are not}} bound by the constraints on shortening velocity that limit power output of muscle contractile elements (Hill, 1950 a; Alexander, 1988). Yet, how and when these elastic elements are stretche...|$|R
40|$|Muscles power movement, yet the {{conceptual}} link between muscle performance and locomotor performance is poorly developed. Frog jumping provides an ideal system {{to probe the}} relationship between muscle capacity and locomotor performance, because a jump is a single discrete event and mechanical power output is a critical determinant of jump distance. We tested the hypothesis that interspecific variation in jump performance {{could be explained by}} variability in available muscle power. We used force plate ergometry to measure power produced during jumping in <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> (Osteopilus septentrionalis), leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) and cane toads (Bufo marinus). We also measured peak isotonic power output in isolated plantaris muscles for each species. As expected, jump performance varied widely. Osteopilus septentrionalis developed peak power outputs of 1047. 0 ± 119. 7 W kg− 1 hindlimb muscle mass, about five times that of B. marinus (198. 5 ± 54. 5 W kg− 1). Values for R. pipiens were intermediate (543. 9 ± 96. 2 W kg− 1). These differences in jump power were not matched by differences in available muscle power, which were 312. 7 ± 28. 9, 321. 8 ± 48. 5 and 262. 8 ± 23. 2 W kg− 1 muscle mass for O. septentrionalis, R. pipiens and B. marinus, respectively. The lack of correlation between available muscle power and jump power suggests that non-muscular mechanisms (e. g. elastic energy storage) can obscure the link between muscle mechanical performance and locomotor performance...|$|R

Once in a new location, the frogs become an invasive species.

50|$|On the IUCN Red List the Red-Eyed Coqui is {{classified}} as Least Concerned, meaning that {{in the absence of}} any threats it is not considered to be close to extinction (2). This is partly due to the wide range of suitable habitats for the Red-Eyed Coqui’s range (2). Puerto Rico’s increasing forest habitat assists in the increase of suitable habitats for the frog (3).

40|$|Amphibians {{are declining}} at {{alarming}} rates globally. Multiple {{factors contribute to}} these declines, including chemical contaminants and emergent diseases. In recent years, agrochemical use, especially fungicide applications, has increased considerably. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} these agrochemicals leave application sites and enter wetlands via runoff and have detrimental effects on non-target organisms. For example, exposure to contaminants can have multifarious effects on amphibians, such as reducing their ability to deal with a secondary stressor, such as disease. A pathogen that is found concomitant with chemical contaminants in aquatic systems is Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Bd has decimated amphibian populations worldwide. Susceptibility to this pathogen varies across amphibian life stages, and is greater in adults than larvae. Consequently, it is important {{to examine the effects of}} simultaneous and serial Bd and agrochemical exposure throughout amphibian development. I assessed the combined effects of 3 different fungicides and Bd on two amphibian species: <b>Cuban</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and grey <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> (Hyla versicolor), both simultaneously and across life stages. To elucidate the complexities of these interactions, I conducted two experiments, one in the laboratory and another in outdoor mesocosms. Frogs were exposed to most of the possible combinations of fungicides and Bd as tadpoles and metamorphs. The presence of fungicides during the tadpole stage caused no difference in timing to metamorphosis and therefore no extension of time animals were exposed to the pathogen. Fungicides did not reduce fungal growth; in fact, tadpoles exposed simultaneously to a fungicide and Bd, regardless of the specific fungicide, had increased fungal loads compared to acetone controls. Additionally, animals exposed to both stressors simultaneously had higher mortality compared to controls or any of the stressors singly. Lastly, the fungicide had persistent effects on amphibian health by affecting susceptibility to Bd later in ontogeny. Frogs exposed to any of the three fungicides as a tadpole had higher Bd prevalence, Bd abundance, and Bd-induced mortality when challenged with Bd after metamorphosis, an average of 71 days after their last fungicide exposure. In conclusion, I found no benefits of fungicides for amphibians. In fact, results indicate both immediate and delayed negative effects of exposure to fungicides and Bd. These findings highlight the importance of studying multiple potential contributors to amphibian declines, simultaneously and sequentially, to understand net effects of stressors on amphibian performance...|$|R
