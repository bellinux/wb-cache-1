25|$|The <b>Cold</b> <b>Cathode</b> Gauge Experiment (CCGE) {{which was}} part of the ALSEP on Apollo 13 was never flown again. It was a version of the <b>Cold</b> <b>Cathode</b> Ion Gauge (CCIG) which {{featured}} on Apollo 12, Apollo 14, and Apollo 15. The CCGE was designed as a standalone version of the CCIG. On other missions, the CCIG was connected as part of the Suprathermal Ion Detector (SIDE). Because of the aborted landing, this experiment was never deployed. Other experiments included on Apollo 13's ALSEP included the Heat Flow Experiment (HFE), the Passive Seismic Experiment (PSE), and the Charged Particle Lunar Environment Experiment (CPLEE).|$|E
25|$|The many {{applications}} of X-rays immediately generated enormous interest. Workshops began making specialized versions of Crookes tubes for generating X-rays and these first-generation <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> or Crookes X-ray tubes were used until about 1920.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>cathode</b> lamps are {{generally}} less efficient than thermionic emission lamps because the cathode fall voltage is much higher. The increased fall voltage results in more power dissipation at tube ends, {{which does not}} contribute to light output. However, this is less significant with longer tubes. The increased power dissipation at tube ends also usually means <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> tubes have to be run at a lower loading than their thermionic emission equivalents. Given the higher tube voltage required anyway, these tubes can easily be made long, and even run as series strings. They are better suited for bending into special shapes for lettering and signage, and can also be instantly switched on or off.|$|E
40|$|We present here a {{new device}} capable of {{generating}} X-rays {{based on a}} novel concept of electron source: carbon nanotube-based <b>cold</b> <b>cathodes.</b> In particular, we developed lithographic-based synthesis protocols for obtaining aligned and vertically oriented carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown by CVD.

40|$|Carbon-nanotube coated non-planar <b>cold</b> <b>cathodes</b> emit {{electrons}} of {{high current}} densities at low applied electric fields.

50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>cathodes</b> {{may also}} emit {{electrons}} by photoelectric emission. These are often called photocathodes {{and are used}} in phototubes used in scientific instruments and image intensifier tubes used in night vision goggles.|$|R
25|$|However, {{there are}} also tubes that operate in <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> mode, whereby {{electrons}} are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference (voltage) between the electrodes. This {{does not mean the}} electrodes are cold (indeed, they can be very hot), but it does mean they are operating below their thermionic emission temperature. Because <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> lamps have no thermionic emission coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than hot cathode tubes. This quality makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications (such as backlights in liquid crystal displays). Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode.|$|E
25|$|The {{particle}} source. The {{design of}} the source depends on the particle that is being moved. Electrons are generated by a <b>cold</b> <b>cathode,</b> a hot cathode, a photocathode, or radio frequency (RF) ion sources. Protons are generated in an ion source, which can have many different designs. If heavier particles are to be accelerated, (e.g., uranium ions), a specialized ion source is needed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century there has been renewed {{interest}} in vacuum tubes, this time with the electron emitter formed on a flat silicon substrate, as in integrated circuit technology. This subject is now called vacuum nanoelectronics. The most common design uses a <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> in the form of a large-area field electron source (for example a field emitter array). With these devices, electrons are field-emitted from a large number of closely spaced individual emission sites.|$|E
25|$|CCFL: The LCD {{panel is}} lit either by two <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> {{fluorescent}} lamps placed at opposite {{edges of the}} display or an array of parallel CCFLs behind larger displays. A diffuser then spreads the light out evenly across the whole display. For many years, this technology had been used almost exclusively. Unlike white LEDs, most CCFLs have an even-white spectral output resulting in better color gamut for the display. However, CCFLs are less energy efficient than LEDs and require a somewhat costly inverter to convert whatever DC voltage the device uses (usually 5 or 12V) to ~1000 V needed to light a CCFL. The thickness of the inverter transformers also limits how thin the display can be made.|$|E
25|$|Low cost {{ballasts}} mostly contain only {{a simple}} oscillator and series resonant LC circuit. When turned on, the oscillator starts, and resonant current excites the LC circuit. This resonant current directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer. This principle {{is called the}} current resonant inverter circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1nbsp&kV and the lamp ignites. The process is too fast to preheat the cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors to disable instant starting and give some time to preheat the filaments.|$|E
40|$|In {{the article}} {{technologies}} used in micro and nanoelectronics there are shortly described. Attention {{is devoted to}} lithography as a basic technology. Principles of electron and ion lithography are mentioned as well as progressive ion projection lithography. Some remarks to nanotubes as means of <b>cold</b> <b>cathodes</b> for vacuum electron tubes for nanoelectronics are presented...|$|R
5000|$|With the {{development}} of the RF antenna ion source, or [...] "non-thermionic ion source," [...] the ion source has an advantage over conventional <b>cold</b> <b>cathodes</b> and hot filament ion sources. The filament continuously burns out over time with a shorter lifespan, requiring venting of the ion source to atmosphere and rebuilding of the ion source.|$|R
5000|$|Field {{electron}} emission: A strong {{electric field}} {{can be applied}} to the surface by placing an electrode with a high positive voltage near the cathode. The positively charged electrode attracts the electrons, causing some electrons to leave the cathode's surface. [...] This process is used in <b>cold</b> <b>cathodes</b> in some electron microscopes, and in microelectronics fabrication, ...|$|R
25|$|The {{filaments}} {{can burn}} out (fail) {{at the end}} of the lamp's lifetime, opening the circuit and losing the capability to heat up. Both filaments lose function as they are connected in series, with just a simple switch start circuit a broken filament will render the lamp completely useless. Filaments rarely burn out or fail open circuit unless the filament becomes depleted of emitter and the control gear is able to supply a high enough voltage across the tube to operate it in <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> mode. Some digital electronic ballasts are capable of detecting broken filaments and can still strike an arc with one or both filaments broken providing there is still sufficient emitter. A broken filament in a lamp attached to a magnetic ballast often causes both lamps to burn out or flicker.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electronic}} ignition (a <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> type) was tested in 1948 by Delco-Remy, while Lucas introduced a transistorized ignition in 1955, {{which was used}} on BRM and Coventry Climax Formula One engines in 1962. The aftermarket began offering EI that year, with both the AutoLite Electric Transistor 201 and Tung-Sol EI-4 (thyratron capacitive discharge) being available. Pontiac became the first automaker to offer an optional EI, the breakerless magnetic pulse-triggered Delcotronic, on some 1963 models; it was also available on some Corvettes. The first commercially available all solid-state (SCR) capacitive discharge ignition was manufactured by Hyland Electronics in Canada also in 1963. Ford fitted a Lucas system on the Lotus 25s entered at Indianapolis the next year, ran a fleet test in 1964, and began offering optional EI on some models in 1965. Beginning in 1958, Earl W. Meyer at Chrysler worked on EI, continuing until 1961 and resulting in use of EI on the company's NASCAR hemis in 1963 and 1964.|$|E
25|$|Following further campaigns by Greenpeace, in 2008, Apple {{became the}} first {{electronics}} manufacturer to fully eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line. In June 2007, Apple began replacing the <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro. Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale. In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs. All Apple products now have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables. All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category.|$|E
30|$|We have {{developed}} a relatively straightforward, effective, and affordable approach to achieve hierarchal 3 D structuring of the h-MWCNT-based <b>cold</b> <b>cathodes.</b> Our process {{is based on the}} optimized PECVD growth of MWCNTs onto pyramidally KOH-texturized silicon (100) substrates. By varying the aspect ratio of the Si pyramids, we were able to show the significant improvement of the FEE properties of the h-MWCNT cathodes, compared to their Si flat counterparts. In particular, our results show that the higher the AR of the Si pyramids, the lower the TF of the h-MWCNT cathodes. A TF value as low as 1.95 V/μm was achieved for the h-MWCNT cathodes with an AR value of 0.6 (a decrease of more than 40 %, compared to MWCNT forest grown on flat Si substrates). The effectiveness of our approach is also reflected by the higher enhancement factors in both low- and high-field regimes. The prospect of a relatively easy scale up of the hierarchal structuring process developed here makes this approach highly attractive for applications where low-cost and large-surface <b>cold</b> <b>cathodes</b> are needed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>cathodes</b> {{sometimes}} have a rare earth coating to enhance electron emission. Some types contain {{a source of}} beta radiation to start ionization of the gas that fills the tube. In some tubes, glow discharge around the cathode is usually minimized; instead there is a so-called positive column, filling the tube. Examples are the neon lamp and nixie tubes. Nixie tubes too are cold-cathode neon displays that are in-line, but not in-plane, display devices.|$|R

It has been found that the best emission properties are characteristic of DCFs obtained by cathode sputtering. Emission from the surface of such films occurs on the boundaries of the globules...|$|R
25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} transformer {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|E
25|$|The first {{automatic}} electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton, {{an associate of}} Thomas Edison. George Andrew Darby patented the first European electrical heat detector in 1902 in Birmingham, England. In the late 1930s Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger tried to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected that gas entering the sensor would bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit in the instrument. His device did not meet its purpose: small concentrations of gas {{had no effect on}} the sensor's conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette and was soon surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Smoke particles from his cigarette had apparently done what poison gas could not. Jaeger's experiment was one of the advances that {{paved the way for the}} modern smoke detector. In 1939 Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an ionization chamber device capable of detecting combustible gases in mines. He also invented a <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> tube that could amplify the small signal generated by the detection mechanism to a strength sufficient to activate an alarm.|$|E
25|$|Jepsen has {{described}} {{the removal of the}} filters that color the RGB subpixels as the critical design innovation in the new LCD. Instead of using subtractive color filters, the display uses a plastic diffraction grating and lenses on the rear of the LCD to illuminate each pixel. This grating pattern is stamped using the same technology used to make DVDs. The grating splits the light from the white backlight into a spectrum. The red, green and blue components are diffracted into the correct positions to illuminate the corresponding pixel with R, G or B. This innovation results in a much brighter display for a given amount of backlight illumination: while the color filters in a regular display typically absorb 85% of the light that hits them, this display absorbs little of that light. Most LCD screens at the time used <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> fluorescent lamp backlights which were fragile, difficult or impossible to repair, required a high voltage power supply, were relatively power-hungry, and accounted for 50% of the screens' cost (sometimes 60%). The LED backlight in the XO-1 is easily replaceable, rugged, and inexpensive.|$|E

500|$|Gaseous {{mercury is}} used in mercury-vapor lamps and some [...] "neon sign" [...] type {{advertising}} signs and fluorescent lamps.

It is also used in specialist medical care lamps for skin tanning and disinfection. Gaseous mercury is added to <b>cold</b> <b>cathode</b> argon-filled lamps to increase the ionization and electrical conductivity. An argon-filled lamp without mercury will have dull spots and will fail to light correctly. Lighting containing mercury can be bombarded/oven pumped only once. When added to neon filled tubes the light produced will be inconsistent red/blue spots until the initial burning-in process is completed; eventually it will light a consistent dull off-blue color.|$|E
