5|$|Cheese was {{far more}} {{important}} as a foodstuff, especially for common people, {{and it has been}} suggested that it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes. Many varieties of cheese eaten today, like Dutch Edam, Northern French Brie and Italian Parmesan, were available and well known in late medieval times. There were also whey cheeses, like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder cheeses. Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas. Butter, another important dairy product, was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in cattle production in the latter half of the Middle Ages, the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia. While most other regions used oil or lard as <b>cooking</b> <b>fats,</b> butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas. Its production also allowed for a lucrative butter export from the 12th century onward.|$|E

50|$|Fires {{involving}} <b>cooking</b> <b>fats</b> {{and oils}} (classified as class K (US) or F (Australia/Europe/Asia)) burn hotter than most flammable liquids, rendering a standard class B extinguisher ineffective. Flammable liquids have flash points under 37 degrees Celsius. Cooking oil is a combustible liquid, {{since it has}} a flash point over 37 degrees Celsius. Such fires should be extinguished with a wet chemical extinguisher. Extinguishers of this type are designed to extinguish <b>cooking</b> <b>fats</b> and oils through saponification. The extinguishing agent rapidly converts the burning substance to a non-combustible soap. This process is endothermic, meaning that it absorbs thermal energy from its surroundings, which decreases {{the temperature of the}} surroundings, further inhibiting the fire.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that intake of used <b>cooking</b> <b>fat</b> is associated with impaired endothelial function. BACKGROUNDDiets containing high levels of lipid oxidation products may accelerate atherogenesis, but the effect on endothelial function is unknown. METHODSFlow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilation and glyceryl trinitrate-induced endothelium-independent dilation of the brachial artery were investigated in 10 men. Subjects had arterial studies before and 4 h after three test meals: 1) a meal (fat 64. 4 g) rich in <b>cooking</b> <b>fat</b> that had been used for deep frying in a fast food restaurant; 2) the same meal (fat 64. 4 g) rich in unused <b>cooking</b> <b>fat,</b> and 3) a corresponding low fat meal (fat 18. 4 g) without added fat. RESULTSEndothelium-dependent dilation decreased between fasting and postprandial studies after the used fat meal (5. 9 ± 2. 3 % vs. 0. 8 ± 2. 2 %, p = 0. 0003), but there was no significant change after the unused fat meal (5. 3 ± 2. 1 % vs. 6. 0 ± 2. 5 %) or low fat meal (5. 3 ± 2. 3 % vs. 5. 4 ± 3. 3 %). There was no significant difference in endothelium-independent dilation after any of the meals. Plasma free fatty acid concentration did not change significantly during any of the meals. The level of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia was not associated with change in endothelial function. CONCLUSIONSIngestion of a meal rich in fat previously used for deep frying in a commercial fast food restaurant resulted in impaired arterial endothelial function. These findings suggest that intake of degradation products of heated fat contribute to endothelial dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|The {{content of}} fatty acids in margarines and <b>cooking</b> <b>fats</b> {{changes over time}} due to product development.

In this cross-sectional study we aimed to investigate associations of diet with EMFA. Altogether, 1, 033 randomly selected Finnish men, aged from 47 to 75 years filled in a FFQ and their EMFA composition was analyzed. Marine polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake correlated positively with erythro-cyte eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (rs = 0. 415 and rs = 0. 340, respectively, P 0. 001) and inversely with all n- 6 PUFA analyzed (P 0. 001).

40|$|Principal {{component}} analysis (PCA) {{is a popular}} method of dietary patterns analysis, but our understanding of its use to describe changes in dietary patterns over time is limited. Using a FFQ, we assessed the diets of 12, 572 nonpregnant women aged 20 - 34 y from Southampton, UK, of whom 2270 and 2649 became pregnant and provided complete dietary data in early and late pregnancy, respectively. Intakes of white bread, breakfast cereals, cakes and biscuits, processed meat, crisps, fruit and fruit juices, sweet spreads, confectionery, hot chocolate drinks, puddings, cream, milk, cheese, full-fat spread, <b>cooking</b> <b>fats</b> and salad oils, red meat, and soft drinks increased in pregnancy. Intakes of rice and pasta, liver and kidney, vegetables, nuts, diet cola, tea and coffee, boiled potatoes, and crackers decreased in pregnancy. PCA {{at each time point}} produced 2 consistent dietary patterns, labeled prudent and high-energy. At each time point in pregnancy, and for both the prudent and high-energy patterns, we derived 2 dietary pattern scores for each woman: a natural score, based on the pattern defined at that time point, and an applied score, based on the pattern defined before pregnancy. Applied scores are preferred to natural scores to characterize changes in dietary patterns over time because the scale of measurement remains constant. Using applied scores, there was a very small mean decrease in prudent diet score in pregnancy and a very small mean increase in high-energy diet score in late pregnancy, indicating little overall change in dietary patterns in pregnancy...|$|E

The association between dietary intake of BHA and BHT and stomach cancer risk was investigated in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) that started in 1986 among 120, 852 men and women aged 55 to 69 years. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire {{was used to assess}} food consumption. Information on BHA or BHT content of <b>cooking</b> <b>fats,</b> oils, mayonnaise and other creamy salad dressings and dried soups was obtained by chemical analysis, a Dutch database of food additives (ALBA) and the Dutch Compendium of Foods and Diet Products. After 6. 3 years of follow-up, complete data on BHA and BHT intake of 192 incident stomach cancer cases and 2035 subcohort members were available for case-cohort analysis. Mean intake of BHA or BHT among subcohort members was 105 and 351 μg/day, respectively. For consumption of mayonnaise and other creamy salad dressings with BHA or BHT no association with stomach cancer risk was observed. A statistically non-significant decrease in stomach cancer risk was observed with increasing BHA and BHT intake [rate ratio (RR) highest/lowest intake of BHA= 0. 57 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 25 - 1. 30] and BHT= 0. 74 (95 % CI: 0. 38 - 1. 43).

40|$|The aim was {{to analyse}} whether changes in the Healthy Food Intake Index (HFII) during {{pregnancy}} are related to gestational diabetes (GDM) risk. The 251 pregnant women participating had a pre-pregnancy BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) and/or a history of GDM. A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed during {{the first and second}} trimesters of pregnancy for assessment of GDM. A normal OGTT result at first trimester was an inclusion criterion for the study. FFQ collected at first and second trimesters served for calculating the HFII. A higher HFII score reflects higher adherence to the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) (score range 0 - 17). Statistical methods included Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test and linear and logistic regression analyses. The mean HFII at first trimester was 10. 1 (95 % CI 9. 7, 10. 4) points, and the mean change from the first to the second trimester was 0. 35 (95 % CI 0. 09, 0. 62) points. The range of the HFII changes varied from - 7 to 7. The odds for GDM decreased with higher HFII change (adjusted OR 0. 83 per one unit increase in HFII; 95 % CI 0. 69, 0. 99; P= 0. 043). In the analysis of the association between HFII-sub-indices and GDM, odds for GDM decreased with higher HFII-Fat change (fat percentage of milk and cheese, type of spread and <b>cooking</b> <b>fats)</b> but it was not significant in a fully adjusted model (P= 0. 058).
