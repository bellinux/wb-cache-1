40|$|Air quality {{evaluation}} was performed regarding atmos-pheric particles (TSP and PM 10), As, Cd, Ni and Pb in a Spanish coastal area {{for five years}} (2001 - 2005) in order to compare these values with other areas in the Mediterranean basin. The study area, Vila-real (Castellón, Spain), is highly industrialised, with businesses involved in non-metallic mineral material industries (ceramic production) and chemi-cal industries (<b>colour,</b> <b>frit</b> and enamel manufacturing) stand-ing out. The origin of the contamination {{in this area is}} both natural and anthropogenic. The natural origin is due to the re-suspension of mineral materials from the surrounding moun-tains and from the long-range transport of materials from North Africa. The anthropogenic contamination sources are the aforementioned industries as well as vehicular traffic. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the concentrations of these contaminants and elaborate a series of mathemati-cal models of them. The goal is to provide a useful instru-ment to alert the population facing possible episodes of high concentrations of atmospheric pollutants. Once the particle samples were collected in quartz fiber filters, the concen-tration levels of TSP and PM 10 were determined gravim-etrically. The chemical analysis of the filters was carried out by ICP-MS. Predictive models have been constructed by using Multiple Regression Analysis together with Time Series Models (ARIMA). The SPSS 14. 0 statistical software has been employed to analyze the obtained experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray {{fluorescence}} and scanning {{electron microscopy}} analyses were carried out on a typical Sèvres soft (frit) porcelain plate from 1781 {{in order to determine}} the chemical and mineralogical composition as well as the microstructure of its ceramic body, glaze, overglaze decoration and gilding. The body is rich in SiO₂ (73 mass%), CaO (16) and alkali oxide (8) and shows acicular wollastonite and tridymite crystals embedded in a glassy matrix consisting of SiO₂ (75), K₂O (12) and CaO (9). The 50 – 90 µm thick, transparent lead glaze (40. 9 PbO) contains 47. 6 SiO₂, 6. 5 K₂O and 3. 5 CaO and shows a 35 – 75 µm thick reaction zone (50 SiO₂, 30 PbO, 14 CaO) towards the body. The maximum thickness of the different paints is 50 µm, with 15 µm as mean thickness of the individual paint stroke. Two blue colours, for the dentil comb and the flower painting, are chemically distinct (colouring CoO in the dental rim 7, in the flower’s blue 2 mass%) and contain many As- and Pb- rich globules and dendrites. Pseudohexagonal shaped platelets of Pb–Sb–Sn triple oxide crystals, embedded in a colourless glassy matrix, generate the opacity and the colour of the yellow paints. Opaque olive green colours are created by the combination of such yellow crystals with a bluish, Cu and Co bearing glassy matrix. The opaque red overglaze enamel is a mechanical mix of yellow Pb–Sb oxide crystals with an iron- rich (16 Fe₂O₃) Pb–silica glass. Purple is very homogeneous and shows tiny drops of pure gold (max. diam. 0. 5 µm) in a glassy matrix (47 PbO, 46 SiO₂, 5 K₂O). Violet is a mechanical blend of flower’s blue and purple. The pure (99. 5 Au, 0. 5 Fe₂O₃) gilt consists of several folded gold particles. The results of this study are only broadly consistent with the archival documented 18 th century technologies. The compositional dissimilarities of the studied enamels suggest that each <b>colour</b> was independently <b>fritted.</b> Consequently, the original colour recipes written down by Hellot in 1753 must have been modified in the 30 years since then...|$|R
