5|$|Programming of Dynamic Speech Generating devices {{is usually}} done by augmentative {{communication}} specialists. Specialists {{are required to}} <b>cater</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> needs of the patients because the patients usually choose what kinds of words/ phrases they want.

Additionally, SGDs are rarely covered by health insurance companies. As a result, resources are very limited with regards to both funding and staffing. Dr. John Costello of Boston Children’s Hospital has been the driving force soliciting donations to keep these program running and well-staffed both within his hospital and in hospitals across the country.|$|E

5|$|Belle's yellow ballgown was {{inspired}} by a similar costume Hepburn had worn in the film Roman Holiday (1953). Hahn and a team of male filmmakers designed the ballgown while consuming pizza and alcohol. Originally, the marketing department ordered that Belles' dress be pink to <b>cater</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> female audience, but art director Brian McEntee convinced studio to make the dress gold in order to make her to distinguish her from other Disney Princess, specifically Aurora's from Sleeping Beauty (1950). Art director Brian McEntee suggested that Belle be the only character in her village to wear blue in order emphasize {{the fact that she is}} different and an outcast. The colors Belle wears also mimic her emotions, blue being associated with sadness and loneliness. Blue was also used to symbolize good, while Gaston's red represented evil. According to the Directory of World Cinema: American Hollywood by Lincoln Geraghty, Belle {{was inspired}} by actress Judy Garland's role as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Julie Andrews' performance as Maria von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965).|$|E
5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus uses a proprietary, {{in-house}} engine {{referred to}} as the Ready at Dawn engine, which expanded on the engine created for their previous game, Daxter (2006), to include a fluid and cloth simulator. The camera system was modified to <b>cater</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fixed cinematic camera for God of War gameplay, and the lighting system was reworked to aid in presenting realistic graphics. The game was originally designed for the PlayStation Portable's restricted 222megahertz (MHz) processor. Ready at Dawn repeatedly contacted Sony regarding increasing the clock speed of the PSP on account of the difference to the game and had developed a version of the game with higher speed. Sony released a firmware upgrade that allowed games to use the full 333MHz processor. The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects, lighting effects, and shadows as well as improved enemy intelligence. The upgrade, however, noticeably decreased battery life. After the game's completion, Game Director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles, characters, and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints.|$|E

5|$|In particular, after 1849, Wagner resented Meyerbeer's {{continuing}} {{success at}} a time when his own vision of German opera had little chance of prospering. After the May Uprising in Dresden of 1849, Wagner was for some years a political refugee facing a prison sentence or worse should he return to Saxony. During his period of living in exile he had few sources of income and little opportunity of getting his own works performed. The success of Le prophète sent Wagner over the edge, and he was also deeply envious of Meyerbeer's wealth. In reaction he published, under a pseudonym, his 1850 essay 'Jewishness in Music'. Without specifically naming Meyerbeer, he interpreted the popular success of the latter as the undermining of German music by alleged Jewish venality and willingness to <b>cater</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lowest tastes, and attributed the supposed poor quality of such 'Jewish music' to Jewish speech and song patterns, which 'though the cultured son of Jewry takes untold pains to strip them off, nevertheless they shew an impertinent obstinacy in cleaving to him'.|$|E
5|$|More {{accelerated}} {{classes were}} added, but {{the core of}} the gifted curriculum remained the individualized approaches and learning by doing that had long been central to the Avery Coonley curriculum. Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted curriculum. In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to <b>cater</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> needs of gifted preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus on nature, music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.|$|E
5|$|State Shinto {{was heavily}} {{emphasised}} in the 1930s {{as a means}} to promote Japanese nationalism and acculturalisation of Palauans to Japanese norms. A few shrines were built around Palau during the 1930s. Of particular note was the completion of the Taisha Nanyo Jinja (transliterally the Great Southern Shrine) in November 1940 at Koror, which subsequently served as the central shrine in Micronesia. Civilian participation of Shinto rituals was heavily emphasised, which focused on Japanese cultural ideals and worship of the Japanese emperor. Shinto, Zen Buddhist and Tenrikyo missions were also encouraged to establish religious missions, and the first Buddhist temple in Palau was erected in 1926, mainly to <b>cater</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spiritual needs of the Japanese settlers. Early Japanese settlers reportedly built small Shinto shrines in agricultural colonies before the civilian government actively encouraged religious missionary activities in Palau.|$|E
