50|$|Protoplasts {{are widely}} used for DNA {{transformation}} (for making genetically modified organisms), since the cell wall would otherwise block the passage of DNA into the cell. In the case of plant cells, protoplasts may be regenerated into whole plants first by growing into a group of plant cells that develops into a callus and then by regeneration of shoots (<b>caulogenesis)</b> from the callus using plant tissue culture methods. Growth of protoplasts into callus and regeneration of shoots requires the proper balance of plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium that must be customized for each species of plant. Unlike protoplasts from vascular plants, protoplasts from mosses, such as Physcomitrella patens, do not need phytohormones for regeneration, nor do they form a callus during regeneration. Instead, they regenerate directly into the filamentous protonema, mimicking a germinating moss spore.|$|E

It particularly concerns the nature of explants and the hormonal composition of the induction medium. For the explants, the hypocotyls show the best answers of <b>caulogenesis,</b> in term of yield, followed by far by the cotyledons. The roots were recalcitrant. Concerning the hormonal composition of the induction medium, they are the mediums containing 0, 1 mg. l- 1 of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and 3 mg. l- 1 (M 2) and 1 mg. l- 1 (M 1) of 6 -benzyladenine (BA) which expressed the best inductive capacities of <b>caulogenesis.</b> In the same way, the combination established between naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and kinetin (KN), both at 0, 5 mg. l- 1, led to satisfactory yield.

40|$|Se estudió la inducción caulogénica utilizando semillas maduras como explantos iniciales. Para la callogénesis se evaluaron cuatro concentraciones de BAP (0, 3, 5 y 7 mg L- 1) en los medios MS, B 5 y SP. Para la <b>caulogénesis</b> se utilizaron los callos formados en la etapa anterior, evaluando el efecto de dos concentraciones de ANA (0, 1 y 0, 5 mg L- 1), manteniendo constante el BAP (1, 0 mg L- 1) y el medio nutritivo del cual provenían. En la callogénesis los mejores resultados se obtuvieron con 7 mg L- 1 de BAP (73 %) al utilizar el medio B 5, difiriendo significativamente de MS. Para la <b>caulogénesis,</b> con el medio SP se obtuvieron los valores más altos de formación de brotes (78 %) difiriendo significativamente de los medios B 5 y MS.

40|$|<b>Caulogenesis</b> and rhizogenesis {{were studied}} in cultured explants of Begonia erythrophylla. The {{patterns}} of development {{were compared to}} each other and to explants cultured on non-organogenic media. Initially morphological and histological observations were carried out using both light and scanning electron microscopy. Shoots and roots were formed from cells of epidermal origin and were often associated with glandular hairs. Deposition of starch was correlated to organogenesis, with starch grains localized in the superficial layers of the explant, prior to the formation of meristematic regions. Once formed, meristematic regions showed high levels of enzymatic activity compared to the surrounding tissues. Media transfer experiments were conducted between root inducing medium (RIM) and shoot inducing medium (SIM), shoot inducing medium and a basal medium containing no growth regulators (BM), and RIM and BM. It was found that explants became determined for shoot production after 7 days, while they were determined for root production after 3 days on RIM before transfer to BM. Explants were found to be weakly canalized for rhizogenesis for the first 2 days after determination, thereafter they became strongly canalized. Explants were strongly canalized for <b>caulogenesis</b> once determined. Culture on BM prior to exposure to an organogenic medium resulted in the gradual loss of competence with time, but exposure for 2 days to either SIM or RIM resulted in explants becoming competent to respond to opposite inductive medium. Using one and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, both unlabelled protein and protein labelled in vivo with [35 S]-methionine were extracted from organogenic and non-organogenic explants. Silver-stained gels and fluorographs were analyzed to identify different sets of polypeptides associated with development in vitro. Overall the levels of 59 silver-stained and 29 labelled polypeptides were altered. It was shown that rhizogenesis and <b>caulogenesis</b> in petiole sections of B. erythrophylla are associated with both quantitative and qualitative changes in the expression of polypeptides. Most of these changes occur at, or after, the point of organ determination. Some of those associated with <b>caulogenesis</b> were also observed when leaf discs were cultured on SIM. Tissues of mature plants were examined for the presence of these polypeptides. The process of <b>caulogenesis</b> in petiole explants can be further divided by the use of chemical inhibitors of shoot formation. Additions of sorbitol, ribose, acetylsalicylic acid or tri-iodobenzoic acid to SIM, respectively, inhibits shoot formation without killing the explants. These inhibitors are only effective if explants are exposed prior to certain stages of development, after which they fail to inhibit shoot formation. The effects of these inhibitors on the pattern polypeptide changes associated with culture on SIM was determined...|$|E

In consequence, the aim of the experimental researches presented in this study was the innovation of in vitro multiplication at Brussels cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. oleracea var. gemmifera), from subvarieties Rosella and Sanda, by direct <b>caulogenesis</b> induced under the influence of explant type (leaf, cotyledon, epicotyl, hypocotyl and radicle) and through direct rhizogenesis induced under the influence of exogenous auxin type (NAA or IBA).

40|$|Superficial {{cell layers}} of a {{quantitative}} short-day tobacco plant (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. White Burley) were excised from {{different parts of}} the inflorescence (i. e. pedicels, branch internodes, rachises), and cultured in continuous darkness, continuous light or 8 h light/ 16 h dark daily. The flowering response in vitro of the different types of explants was investigated with respect to the effect of light on the post-evocation phases of the flowering process and explant commitment. Treatment effect was qualitatively and quantitatively influenced by explant origin. Three morphogenic features were observed: flower neoformation, <b>caulogenesis</b> and rhizogenesis (the latter on rachis explants only). Under all treatments, the highest flowering potential was shown by pedicels, while the highest vegetative potential was shown by rachises. Branch internodes showed an intermediate response, but with a tendency towards <b>caulogenesis,</b> which probably reflects their phylogenetic origin. Thus, opposite gradients of the neoformation of flowering and vegetative buds on explants were observed under all treatments. Pedicels formed new single flowers rather than inflorescences, while rachises regenerated mainly inflorescences. In darkness, flowering was limited mostly to pedicels. Vegetative bud formation was higher than floral bud regeneration in all types of explant. Continuous light enhanced the flowering response mostly in pedicel and branch internode explants. Short days enhanced flower bud formation in vitro on all types of explant. Results with respect to microsporogenesis, flower and inflorescence anomalies observed under darkness also seem to support the existence of a quantitative photoperiodic control on floral neoformation in vitro in this plant. These results suggest that in Nicotiana tabacum cv. White Burley in vivo floral induction, initiation and development are governed by the same photoperiodic requirements...|$|E

Three experiments were performed: in the first, {{we compared the}} effects of NaCl at 0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mM in factorial combination with 3, 9, and 27 mM CaCl 2. In the second, NaCl was tested at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mM with CaCl 2 at 0. 3, 1. 0, and 3. 0 mM. The third experiment was carried out with the same experimental design as the second one but replacing NaCl with Na 2 SO 4. Shoot regeneration was evaluated after 50 d of culturing: 25 in darkness and 25 in white light. In the first experiment, shoot regeneration was very poor and was observed only at the lower salt concentrations. In the second experiment, the percentages of caulogenic leaves were much higher, but decreased with increasing NaCl concentration.

Since tissues transformed with rolB gene show an increased binding capacity of auxin, the response of rolB-explants was compared with that of the wild type. Thin cell layers from floral branches were cultured in the presence of a wide range (0 - 10 mu M) of indoleacetic acid alone, under various phototreatments (continuous darkness, 8 h light/day, and 16 h light/day). Floral, vegetative and rooting responses were favoured in the transgenic explants. Flower neoformation was stimulated by long days and by exogenous auxin (1 mu M). In rolB-thin cell layers flowering also occurred in the most unfavourable culture conditions (i. e. continuous darkness combined with either hormone-free medium or 10 mu M auxin).

In the sequence Kin-BA, the production of adventitious shoots decreased and reddish-coloured nodular structures (RNS) of meristematic appearance increased with increasing duration of Kin treatment, while somatic embryo formation was optimal at 8 d. In the Kin-TDZ sequence, shoot production was initially pronounced, but it declined with increasing duration of the Kin treatment, while the number of roots, somatic embryos and RNS increased. TDZ-BA treatments induced marked shoot production, which gradually increased with increasing duration of TDZ treatment. The presence of TDZ and a long treatment duration appeared to be very important factors in inducing <b>caulogenesis.</b> Kin appeared to be effective in shoot induction but not in shoot development; the results of this work demonstrate that RNS were adventitious shoots blocked at an early developmental stage on account of insufficient cytokinin activity.

We also found that the content of Spm increased more than three folds from 21 to 35  days of rooting, compared to the control (Fig.  2 c). We speculate that increased endogenous Put and Spd content may promote root initiation and increased endogenous Spm content may induce root initiation and growth because no such a change in the levels of Put, Spd, and Spm was obtained from the control shoots. Our results indicate that altered polyamine metabolism is associated with in vitro rooting and that the changes in polyamines content during in vitro rooting could be related to in vitro root induction and formation. These results may be of value for further application of in vitro regeneration and genetic transformation in P. strobus.|$|E
40|$|A rapid clonal {{multiplication}} scheme comprising direct multiple shoot initiation and downsizing of the node with buds proliferated upon during subculture {{was developed}} for Plumbago rosea. Sixty five per cent of the nodes (~ 2. 0 cm) dissected out of young shoots from field grown plants and cultured in MS agar medium containing 3 % sucrose and 15. 4 μM BAP remained contamination free and responded at 95 % rate with callusing at basal cut end and axillary bud break in 5 days followed by the formation of 2. 41 ± 0. 14 shoots of 0. 87 ± 0. 14 cm length in 3 weeks. Though differences in frequency and number of buds formed between nodes of 1 - 5 positions from the young shoots was negligible, the shoots emanated from the youngest node were shorter (0. 92 ± 0. 19 cm) than those (2. 3 ± 0. 50 cm) of the mature 5 th node. Synergistic influence of BAP and auxins on <b>caulogenesis</b> was absent. Bud emergence in shorter (~ 0. 5 cm) nodes was delayed up to 3 weeks and extensive callus proliferation from the cut basal end overlapped the 8. 2 ± 0. 37 axillary shoots/buds formed after 7 weeks. Reduction in the size (downsized) of the 2. 0 cm node with buds to 1. 0 cm by dissecting out the basal internodal segment having the callus and subculture of them (~ 1. 0 cm) with buds {{in contact with the}} medium for 3 weeks contributed to maximum multiplication of 42. 1 ± 5. 40 shoot buds. Division of the shoot cluster and transfer of 2 - 3 shoots (0. 5 - 1. 5 cm) in a clump to MS basal liquid medium induced elongation of the shoots to 4. 1 ± 0. 18 cm in 2 weeks. Shoots of 3. 0 - 4. 2 cm length were rooted within 3 weeks at 100 % efficiency in vitro or ex vitro without hardening. In vitro rhizogenesis in presence of 0. 49 μM IBA is recommended for enhanced rooting and high yield of commercially important tuberous roots during cultivation in the field...|$|E
40|$|Agrohacterium tumefaciens strains were {{isolated}} from 11 different ecological and temporal regions Punjab, Pakistan. From these ecological and temporal regions 62 A. tumefaciens strains {{were isolated}} from 33 plants belonging to 18 different families. These strains were characterized morphologically, biochemically and physiologically. All stains belong to biotype I as they produced ketolactose from lactose. Strains Shared morphological, biochemical and physiological characters, however they exhibited minor differences in colony and cell sizes, in some biochemical and physiological characters. Optimum temperature {{for the growth}} of these strains was 28 C. Irrespective of temperature, i. e. 28 Â° or 37 Â°C, all strains showed specific affinity for pH 6. Metallic salts profiles revealed that all strains showed resistance against Ba (except Pg 1), Mn, Pb and Zn salts, while all were sensitive to Cr salt. or other metallic salts tested various responses were observed. Antibiotic resistance/ sensitivity test of the strains showed that strains have differences in the antibiotic spectrum. However most of them could tolerate ampicillin, carbenicillin and kanamycin, while some strains exhibited resistance against streptomycin and tetracycline. Host range and host specificity experiments depicted that, except MA 2, PR 1, ST 3 and Pg I, all strains have wide host range causing tumorigenesis on atleast 8 host plants (out of 15 plants) tested in the experiment. Some of the strains induced tumors on monocots plants, either on Triticum aestivum (5 strains) or Zea mays (19 strains), while four of these strains, CC 2, DE I, FV 1 and PP 1, caused tumorigenesis both on T aestivum and Z. mays. However on other monocots, Allium cepa and Oryza sativa none of the strain induced tumorigenesis. Out 62 strains 21 strains (AMI, CF 3, CD I, EI 1, EI 2, ED, Pg 2, MAS, MA 6, Ma 4, MI 2, MD, MI 4, PR" ST 3, ST 4, TCl, BPI, BP 2, MAl and MA 3) were sensitive to carbenicillin and ka 1 amycin and 17 strains (AM I, CF 3, CD 1, EI 1, EI 2, ED, Pg 2, MA 5, MA 6, Ma 4, MI 2, MI 3, MI 4, PRI, ST 3, ST 4 and TCI) were utilized in the transformation experiments by co-cultivating calluses (of Brassica oleracea L.). and out of these 17 strains 7 strains (AM 1, EI 1, EI 2, E 13, MI 2, MI 3 and MI 4), which exhibited better callus proliferation response were used in the co-cultivation experiments with explants (of Capsicum annuum L., Linum usitatissimum L, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., Medicago falcata L., Raphamus sativus L. and Spinacea oleracea L.) and expression of T-DNA was monitored on auxin free M,S, medium, while 4 strains (which were obtained from the tumors of plants growing in saline patches) could resist 1 M NaC 1 in the growth medium and with these strains transformation of B oleracea calluses was carried out via co-cultivation and expression of T-DNA genes was observed on auxin free M,S, medium supplemented with 1 M NaC 1. In callus co-cultivation experiment all strains demonstrated T-DNA transfer and expression. However 7 strains (AMI, EI 1, EI 2, EI 3, MI 2, MI 3 and MI 4) showed better callus proliferation response. Three strains AM I, EI 2 and ED gave efficient callus proliferation response accompanied by rhizogenesis and, only AM 1 co-cultivated calli exhibit, <b>caulogenesis.</b> Auxin content of transformed calluses was higher than the control calluses (calluses growing on M. S. medium supplemented with 2, 4 -D and coconut mil). Flax leaf discs transformation was carried out with 7 A. tumefaciens strains (AI, EI 1, EI 2, E 13, MI 2, MI 3 and MI 4). AMI, EI 2 and EI 3 were successful in transforming flax leaf discs co-cultivated for 2 - 3 minutes duration at 28 Â°C. The leaf discs co-cultivated with these strains exhibited rhizogenic, caulogenic and callogepic responses. Maximum variability was showed by the leaf discs co-cultivated with AMI: Auxin content of transformed leaf discs were higher than the control (fresh tissues). The transformed tissues also showed additional protein bands on the S S-P AGE. Transformation of calluses, with 17 strains (AM 1, CF 3, CD I, EI 1, EI 2, 13, Pg 2, MAS, MA 6, Ma 4, MI 2, M 13, MI 4, PRI, ST 3, ST 4 and TCI), and explants with 7 strains (AMI, EI 1, EI 2, EI 3, MI 2, MI 3 and MI 4), carried out for three different time durations (1, 3 and 10 minutes) at three different temperatures (24 Â°, 280 Â° and 37 Â°C) reflected that for maximum T-DNA transfer and expression, from these trains, requires co-cultivation for 3 minutes at 28 Â°C. The genetical analysis of salt tolerant strains, BP 1, BP 2, MAl and MA 3, revealed that salt tolerant genes were plasmid born as transformants were scored in three E. coli K 12 strains C 600, NEM 259 and TG 1 with all the strains. While transconjugants were stored with BP 1, BP 2 and MA 1 by using E. coli K 12 strain HB 101 and CSR 603 as host, both at 28 Â° and 37 Â°C. However better conjugation frequency was obtaine 4 in E. coli K 12 strain HB 101 at 28 Â°C. Plasmids pTiSH 6, pTiSH 7, pTiSH 29 and pTiSH 31 present in BP 1, BP 2, MA 1 and MA 3 respectively were successfully cured with pH (8) treatment both at 28 Â° and 37 Â°C. With the loss pf plasmid salt tolerant property of the strain was also lost, confirming that salt tolerance in these strains was encoded by plasmid. The plasmid free strains obtained at 37 Â°C lost viability, while plasmid free derivatives obtained at 28 Â°C revealed that their tumorigenic ability was lost as they were unable to form tumors on C. annuum and L. esculentum. Transformation of salt sensitive genome of B. oleracea with these four strains demonstrated that calluses proliferated on auxin free M. S. medium supplemented with 1 M NaCl, hence confirming that salt tolerance could be transferred to plant genome. The auxin content of the transformed calli was higher that control calluses (rowing on hormone supplemented M. S. medium). The transformed calli also exhibited extra proteins band...|$|E
