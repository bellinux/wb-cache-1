500|$|Jacques {{began an}} affair in 1962 with her driver, John Schofield, {{who gave her}} the {{attention}} and support that Le Mesurier did not. When Jacques decided to move Schofield into the family home, Le Mesurier moved into a separate room and tried to repair the marriage. He later commented about this period: [...] "I could have walked out, but, whatever my feelings, I loved Hattie and the <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was certain—I had to be certain—that we could repair the damage". The affair caused a downturn in his health; he collapsed on holiday in Tangier in 1963 and was hospitalised in Gibraltar. He returned to London to find the situation between his wife and her lover was unchanged, which caused a relapse.|$|E
500|$|Rado and Ragni {{brought their}} drafts {{of the show}} to {{producer}} Eric Blau who, through common friend Nat Shapiro, connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot. MacDermot had won a Grammy Award in 1961 for his composition [...] "African Waltz" [...] (recorded by Cannonball Adderley). [...] The composer's lifestyle was {{in marked contrast to}} his co-creators: [...] "I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> lived on Staten Island." [...] "I never even heard of a hippie when I met Rado and Ragni." [...] But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show. [...] "We work independently," [...] explained MacDermot in May 1968. [...] "I prefer it that way. [...] They hand me the material. [...] I set it to music." [...] MacDermot wrote the first score in three weeks, starting with the songs [...] "I Got Life", [...] "Ain't Got No", [...] "Where Do I Go" [...] and the title song. [...] He first wrote [...] "Aquarius" [...] as an unconventional art piece, but later rewrote it into an uplifting anthem.|$|E

500|$|Jacques's {{private life}} became {{complicated}} in 1963. The previous year {{she had met}} John Schofield, a cockney used-car dealer, who chauffeured her to a Leukaemia Research Fund event. The couple became romantically involved after the driver gave her the attention and support that Le Mesurier did not. When Jacques decided to move Schofield into the family home, Le Mesurier moved into a separate room. He later commented about this period: [...] "I could have walked out, but, whatever my feelings, I loved Hattie and the <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was certain—I had to be certain—that we could repair the damage". During these upheavals in her personal life, Jacques was surprised {{to be the subject}} of This Is Your Life in February 1963, when she was approached by Eamonn Andrews during rehearsal for the sixth series of Sykes and a.... Although Le Mesurier did not mention the marital situation when being questioned by Andrews, he made the comment that for Jacques [...] "the home comes first", which Merriman considered had been said [...] "rather pointedly". Despite the matrimonial upsets, Jacques and Le Mesurier both appeared in the 1963 Tony Hancock film, The Punch and Judy Man. In 1964 Le Mesurier moved out of the marital home, made a decision to protect Jacques from any negative publicity, and allowed her to bring a divorce suit on grounds of his own infidelity. [...] This ensured that the press blamed him for the break-up, casting Jacques as the victim in the matter.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Eccleston's casting as the Ninth Doctor was {{announced}} on 22 March 2004. He was the production team's first {{choice for the}} character. Other actors linked to the role included Bill Nighy, Richard E Grant, Anthony Head, Eddie Izzard, Hugh Grant and Alan Davies. Jane Tranter, BBC Controller of Drama Commissioning, stated in the announcement of his casting that casting an actor of Eccleston's reputation signalled [...] "our intention to take Doctor Who into the 21st century, as well as retaining its core traditional values– to be surprising, edgy and eccentric". Executive Producer Russell T Davies remarked that casting Eccleston [...] "raises the bar for all of us". Eccleston cited {{the quality of the}} scripts as a reason for joining the cast, stating in an interview on BBC's Breakfast programme that he was [...] "excited" [...] about working with Davies. In the press-pack for the series he states that he had emailed the writer to declare his interest in the role. Eccleston enjoyed having the chance to work on a series aimed at a different demographic than his previous work, noting that [...] "it's aimed at families, so I'm kind of acting for <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feel very lucky {{to be able to do}} that". He felt that being cast by Davies in the series was a [...] "risk" [...] because as an actor he is not known for [...] "charm or comedy" [...] and anticipated a potential backlash due to being built up as [...] "an actor of stature" [...] and the difference between his own interpretation of the character and past doctors.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of January 24, 1977, a {{commando}} unit of Spanish and Italian neo-Fascists shot dead three Communist labour-rights attorneys, a law student and a manager at their law office in downtown Madrid; four others were seriously injured. On February 16 Ibárruri asked Spanish authorities in Moscow {{to allow her to}} return to Spain. She stated that she had travelled outside the USSR many times, that her profession was a publicist and contributor to newspapers and magazines, that she was the president of the PCE and that she wanted to travel freely to her own country. On February 22 the still-illegal PCE made public its list of candidates for the general elections of June 15. Ibárruri appeared as a candidate in two electoral districts to be assured of election, one Madrid and the other Asturias; Carrillo appeared in three. Despite a climate of fear and insecurity the Spanish government legalized the PCE on April 9, but the authorities denied Ibárruri a visa. On April 27 Julian Ruiz said {{that he would not be}} at the airport to greet his estranged wife, [...] "Nevertheless she is the mother of my <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wish her health and a peaceful life.", The PCE arranged to have Ibárruri land in Madrid with or without a visa on May 13. However, on May 12 the authorities relented and provided it.|$|E
