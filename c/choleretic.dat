40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} in 2 volunteers {{to define the}} biotransformation and physiological properties of norursodeoxycholic acid (norUDCA), the C(23) (C(24) -nor) homolog of UDCA. To complement the in vivo studies, the biotransformation of norUDCA ex vivo using precision-cut human liver slices was also characterized. In the human studies, both a tracer dose given intravenously and a physiological dose (7. 9 mmol, 3. 0 g) given orally were excreted equally in bile and urine. By chromatography and mass spectrometry, the dominant biotransformation product of norUDCA in bile and urine was the C- 23 ester glucuronide. Little N-acyl amidation (with glycine or taurine) occurred. The oral dose induced a sustained bicarbonate-rich hypercholeresis, with total bile flow averaging 20 mu L/kg/min, a rate extrapolating to 2 L/d. The increased bile flow was attributed to cholehepatic shunting of norUDCA as well {{to the lack of}} micelles in bile. Phospholipid and cholesterol secretion relative to bile acid secretion decreased during secretion of norUDCA and its metabolites, presumably also because of the absence of micelles in canalicular bile. When incubated with human liver slices, norUDCA was glucuronidated, whereas UDCA was conjugated with glycine or taurine. In conclusion, in humans, norUDCA is glucuronidated rather than amidated. In humans, but not animals, there is considerable renal elimination of the C- 23 ester glucuronide, the dominant metabolite. NorUDCA ingestion induces a bicarbonaterich hypercholeresis and evokes less phospholipid and cholesterol secretion into bile than UDCA. Molecules that undergo cholehepatic shunting should be powerful <b>choleretics</b> in humans...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cynara cardunculus is {{a species}} {{native to the}} Mediterranean basin. It {{includes}} globe artichoke and cultivated cardoon {{as well as their}} progenitor wild cardoon. The species is a source of biophenols, and its leaf extracts have been widely used in herbal medicine as hepatoprotectors and <b>choleretics</b> since ancient times. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of increasing the level of salinity in the nutrient solution (1 or 30 mmol L− 1 NaCl) on biomass production, mineral composition, radical-scavenging activity, caffeoylquinic acids and flavonoids in three artichoke (‘Romolo’, ‘Violetto di Provenza’ and ‘Violetto di Romagna’) and three cultivated cardoon (‘Bianco Avorio’, ‘Bianco Gigante Inerme’ and ‘Gigante di Romagna’) cultivars grown in a floating system. RESULTS: Increased salinity in the nutrient solution decreased the leaf dry biomass and leaf number of artichoke and cultivated cardoon cultivars. Salinity reduced macro- and microelement accumulation in leaves (e. g. N, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and B) but improved their antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, chlorogenic acid, cynarin and luteolin. The cultivated cardoons, especially ‘Bianco Avorio’ and ‘Gigante di Romagna’, showed higher biomass and leaf number than those observed in artichoke genotypes. ‘Violetto di Provenza’ exhibited the highest content of chlorogenic acid, closely followed by ‘Violetto di Romagna’, whereas for cynarin content the highest values were recorded in ‘Violetto di Provenza’, ‘Bianco Avorio’ and ‘Gigante di Romagna’. The highest content of luteolin was recorded in ‘Gigante di Romagna’ and ‘Bianco Avorio’, while the highest content of apigenin was observed in ‘Gigante di Romagna’. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the floating system could be considered an effective tool to improve quality aspects through proper management of the salt concentration in the nutrient solution. They also suggest that specific cultivars should be selected to obtain the desired profile of bioactive compounds...|$|R

40|$|Mycotoxins intoxination is an {{emerging}} disorder in Belgium, due to evolution of cultural practices and harvesting weather conditions. These intoxinations {{are difficult to}} diagnose for the vet practioners, since unspecific clinical signs, {{and their impact on}} ruminant disorder remains controversial. Although legal concentrations have been established for mycotoxins in the EU, farm forages are most of the time not tested (EU 2006 / 576 /EC). In January 2015, a 500 calvings cross-bred Belgian blue cattle herd (BVDV free) referred a second (the first was directly sent to the rendering-plant) unexplained fatal case of jaundice on a 2 months-old calf to the Clinic for Ruminants of the University of Liège for necropsy. In 2013, a case of jaundice due to a Salmonella dublin hepatocholecystitis had previously diagnosed in this farm (Ronzoni et al., 2014), but so far preventions measures were implemented. Necropsy revealed generalized icterus, mild bilirubinuria, splenomegaly, but no precise etiology. On February a second 2 month old calf with jaundice is referred, lethargic, normothermic with a mild diarrhea, Calf shown generalized jaundice, anemia, elevation of leukocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes), TGO, bilirubinemia, total biliary acids and Globulins (alpha 2). He had also diminished erythrocytes and albuminemia. Copraemia, leptospirosis serology, leademia, hemoculture and pancreatic enzymes were within normal ranges, ruling out classic causes of jaundice in calf. Abdomen ultrasonography revealed a mild hyperechogenicity of the liver but no gall bladder modifications. Symptomatic treatment was based on symptoms, with fluidotherapy and <b>choleretics.</b> A third calf was referred three days after in a worst clinical condition, with also a severely modified liver enzymes, but no anemia. Three days after, this calf died and a necropsy revealed petechiae and hemorrhages in the abomasum, congestive mucosae in the distal bowel, white depot in the kidney medulla, modified urine and splenomegaly. Bile bacteriology and leptospirosis PCR was negative and liver histopathology revealed a severe histopathological liver degeneration associated with a disruption of the parenchyma and marked hyperplasia of the bile ducts compatible with chronic metabolic disorder. Meanwhile, the anemic calf recovered from anemia without any treatment after 4 days and was discharged from the Clinic for Ruminants. Considering the weird clinical patterns of these jaundice cases, and the fact that only calves from 2 to 3 months were affected, a nutritional origin as etiology was suspected. To test it, eight clinically healthy two to three months-old calves, of two different pens were sampled. TGO, GLDH, GGT or biliary acids were either modified and the values tended to increase with the age of the calves. The water was analyzed for classic toxics, and cultured for total germ content and everything were within recommended values. The calves fed with a milk replacer (30 % milk powder), and a commercial calf starter until one month of age. Then, they were given a mixed feed (containing cereal mix, cocoa, beet pulp, soja, maize), made at the farm from primary product/byproducts bought from different sources. The mix was tested for mycotoxins presence and ranged from 0. 8 to 1. 5 ppm of Desoxynivalenone (DON), and 115 - 215 ppb of Zearalenone (ZEA). The principal source of DON was maize (3. 1 to 6. 2 ppm), as for ZEA (0. 3 - 0. 6 ppm), but several compounds contained small dose of DON (0. 2 - 0. 7 ppm) for Barley feed, Tanned soja. Cacao contained 2. 7 to 5. 9 ppb of Ochratoxine (OTA). Nutritionnal recommendations were immediately given with a change in the source of maize and an addition of clay and yeast at 40 g/calf/day and hay. Since, any other hypothetic origin to this progressive hepatic intoxination was demostrated, and that the doses founded, even if barely legal in the mix, are not accounted for toxic in the EU regulation, we believe that the calves were chronically exposed to these toxins. However, some mycotoxins experts still claim that various clinical signs would be observed in ruminants, if the rumen is partially defaunated, like in our case with the lake of forage. We propose that monitoring of subclinical liver health could be a key to screen DON effects...|$|R

40|$|Cholestasis is a {{significant}} contributor to liver pathology {{and can lead to}} primary sclerosis and liver failure. Cholestatic bile acids induce apoptosis and necrosis in hepatocytes but these effects can be partially alleviated by the pharmacological application of <b>choleretic</b> bile acids. These actions of bile acids on hepatocytes require changes in the release of Ca(2 +) from intracellular stores and in Ca(2 +) entry. However, the nature of the Ca(2 +) entry pathway affected is not known. We show here using whole cell patch clamp experiments with H 4 -IIE liver cells that taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) and other <b>choleretic</b> bile acids reversibly activate an inwardly-rectifying current with characteristics similar to those of store-operated Ca(2 +) channels (SOCs), while lithocholic acid (LCA) and other cholestatic bile acids inhibit SOCs. The activation of Ca(2 +) entry was observed upon direct addition of the bile acid to the incubation medium, whereas the inhibition of SOCs required a 12 h pre-incubation. In cells loaded with fura- 2, <b>choleretic</b> bile acids activated a Gd(3 +) -inhibitable Ca(2 +) entry, while cholestatic bile acids inhibited the release of Ca(2 +) from intracellular stores and Ca(2 +) entry induced by 2, 5 -di-(tert-butyl) - 1, 4 -benzohydro-quinone (DBHQ). TDCA and LCA each caused a reversible redistribution of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM 1, the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) sensor required for the activation of Ca(2 +) release-activated Ca(2 +) channels and some other SOCs) to puncta, similar to that induced by thapsigargin. Knockdown of Stim 1 using siRNA caused substantial inhibition of Ca(2 +) -entry activated by <b>choleretic</b> bile acids.

40|$|Hydrocortisone {{sodium succinate}} (Solu-Cortef; Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Mich.) {{has been found}} to induce choleresis in unanesthetized fasting dogs fitted with Thomas {{duodenal}} cannulae for direct quantitative collection of bile. In all experiments, bile flow increased (average, 68 %) 15 - 20 min after beginning hydrocortisone by infusion in association with an equivalent increment in the output of sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. In five animals, the <b>choleretic</b> response occurred independently of, and apparently additive to, the effect of simultaneously administered sodium taurocholate. The fluid added to the bile resembled an ultrafiltrate of plasma. Erythritol clearance increased in proportion to flow, suggesting an effect at the hepatocellular rather than ductal level and probably independent, therefore, of endogenous secretin release. Hydrocortisone and its metabolites were excreted in amounts too small to induce choleresis osmotically. Simultaneous administration of sulfobromophthalein sodium blocked the <b>choleretic</b> response without preventing hydrocortisone excretion.

40|$|Ursodesoxycholic acid, {{widely used}} for the {{treatment}} of cholestatic liver disease, causes <b>choleretic,</b> anti-apoptotic and immunomodulatory effects. Here the effects on choleresis of its taurine conjugate tauroursodesoxycholate (TUDC), which is present in the enterohepatic circulation, were correlated with the activation of important elements of intracellular signal transduction in cultured rat hepatocytes and perfused rat liver. TUDC induced a time- and concentration-dependent activation of the small GTP-binding protein Ras and of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) in cultured hepatocytes. Ras activation was dependent on PI 3 -kinase activity, without the involvement of protein kinase C- and genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinases. Ras activation by TUDC was followed by an activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases extracellular-signal-regulated kinase- 1 (Erk- 1) and Erk- 2. In perfused rat liver, PI 3 -kinase inhibitors largely abolished the stimulatory effect of TUDC on taurocholate excretion, suggesting an important role for a PI 3 -kinase/Ras/Erk pathway in the <b>choleretic</b> effect of TUDC...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a new potent <b>choleretic</b> drug (Febuprol) on lipid {{composition}} and cholesterol nucleation time in gallbladder bile was studied in 8 patients with cholesterol gallstones. Nine untreated patients with cholesterol cholecystolithiasis and functioning gallbladder served as controls. Under Febuprol treatment (3 X 100 mg for 6 - 10 days) mean concentrations of total bile acids (125. 4 vs. 59. 5 mmol/l), phospholipids (46. 1 vs. 25. 6 mmol/l) and total lipids (10. 4 vs. 5. 9 g/dl) were significantly higher (p less than 0. 01) than in controls. No significant difference between both groups was calculated for the mean values of cholesterol (17. 8 vs. 13. 3 mmol/l), cholesterol saturation index (1. 5 vs. 2. 1) and cholesterol nucleation time (2. 1 vs. 2. 6 days). Our findings are compatible with a <b>choleretic</b> effect of Febuprol but no alteration of the rapid cholesterol crystallisation in gallbladder bile of patients with cholesterol gallstones was found. ...|$|E
