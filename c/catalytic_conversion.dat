25|$|While {{studying}} {{the effect of}} biodiesel on a D.P.F. {{it was found that}} though the presence of sodium and potassium carbonates aided in the <b>catalytic</b> <b>conversion</b> of ash, as the diesel particulates are catalyzed, they may congregate inside the D.P.F. and so interfere with the clearances of the filter. This may cause the filter to clog and interfere with the regeneration process. In a study on the impact of E.G.R. rates with blends of jathropa biodiesel it was shown that there was a decrease in fuel efficiency and torque output due to the use of biodiesel on a diesel engine designed with an E.G.R. system. It was found that CO and CO2 emissions increased with an increase in exhaust gas recirculation but NOx levels decreased. The opacity level of the jathropa blends was in an acceptable range, where traditional diesel was out of acceptable standards. It was shown that a decrease in Nox emissions could be obtained with an E.G.R. system. This study showed an advantage over traditional diesel within a certain operating range of the E.G.R. system.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} ammonia {{distribution}} upstream {{selective catalytic reduction}} converter on selective <b>catalytic</b> reduction <b>conversion</b> efficiency has been studied in this paper. The {{results indicate that the}} more uniform ammonia concentration distribution upstream converter is, the higher NO x reduction rate and lower NH 3 slip can be achieved. By using static mixers fixed in the pipeline upstream converter, ammonia and exhaust streams can be mixed effectively on the limitation of mixing distance for marine selective catalytic reduction system. Different kinds of static mixers could lead to different degree of mixing between ammonia and exhaust streams, which will affect selective <b>catalytic</b> reduction <b>conversion</b> efficiency directly. Then comparing with the complete mixing degrees of ammonia and exhaust streams, selective <b>catalytic</b> reduction <b>conversion</b> efficiency can be used as an evaluation index for static mixers. Based on CFD method, the effect of mixing degrees of different static mixers on selective <b>catalytic</b> reduction <b>conversion</b> efficiency can be obtained by simulating current commercial catalysts with several different kinds of static mixers such as GK mixer, SK mixer, contour mixer, star-shaped mixer. The trend of NO x reduction rate and NH x slip changing with ammonia distribution and velocity distribution before selective catalytic reduction catalyst layers can be summarized by analyzing the simulating data.
