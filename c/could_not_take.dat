5|$|In 1847 a small {{political}} crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from {{the leadership and}} highlighted Disraeli's differences with his own party. In that year's general election, Lionel de Rothschild had been returned for the City of London. As a practising Jew he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> the oath of allegiance in the prescribed Christian form, and therefore <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> his seat. Lord John Russell, the Whig leader who had succeeded Peel as Prime Minister and like Rothschild was a member for the City of London, proposed in the Commons that the oath should be amended to permit Jews to enter Parliament.|$|E

One of his real estate ventures, a condominium business, was forced to declare bankruptcy and a lawsuit ensued. During 1986, Gravel worked in partnership with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to buy losses that financially troubled Alaska Native Corporations <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> as tax deductions and sell them to large national companies looking for tax writeoffs.|$|E

Further, by his policies: women charged with major crimes should be guarded by other women to prevent sexual abuse; if a woman was widowed, her dowry should be returned; and a husband <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> on a major debt without his wife giving her consent twice.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 December 1955, during the stations' construction, {{switchgear}} exploded in the South station's substation, closing down the generators. Dunston power station <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> the extra load and it also shut down, creating a total blackout on Tyneside. Around 400,000 people were affected by the fault, including 20,000 miners trapped in over a hundred collieries. Power was fully reconnected by that evening. but the failure caused an interruption of work and services worth more than £1,000,000, {{as well as the}} loss of 300 megawatts of electricity.|$|E
5|$|As Vandygriff and his {{men began}} pulling back from the mountain, North Korean fire was falling in the platoon area from nearly all directions. The squad leaders started {{to break up the}} weapons that the platoon <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> out with them. At this time they {{discovered}} Brown was dead. Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags would be the only means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the way down.|$|E

5|$|Bridges {{and other}} key points were {{prepared}} for demolition at short notice by preparing chambers filled with explosives. A Depth Charge Crater was a site in a road (usually at a junction) prepared with buried explosives that could be detonated to instantly form a deep crater as an anti-tank obstacle. The Canadian pipe mine (later known as the McNaughton Tube after General Andrew McNaughton) was a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosives– once in place this {{could be used to}} instantly ruin a road or runway. Prepared demolitions had the advantage of being undetectable from the air—the enemy <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> any precautions against them, or plot a route of attack around them.|$|E
5|$|Béla IV died on 3 May 1270, and Ladislaus's {{father was}} crowned king two weeks later; the new monarch, however, could not {{stabilize}} his rule. Béla IV's closest advisors — Duchess Anna, and Béla IV's former palatine, Henry Kőszegi — left Hungary and sought assistance from Anna's son-in-law, King Ottokar II of Bohemia. The newly appointed Ban of Slavonia, Joachim Gutkeled, also turned against Stephen V and kidnapped Ladislaus {{in the summer}} of 1272. Gutkeled held Ladislaus in captivity in the fortress of Koprivnica in Slavonia. Historian Pál Engel suggests that Joachim Gutkeled planned to force Stephen V to divide Hungary with Ladislaus. Stephen V besieged Koprivnica, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> it. Stephen fell seriously ill and died on 6 August.|$|E
5|$|Franck's first paper there, co-authored with Edward Teller, was on {{photochemical}} processes in crystals. Hans Gaffron became his collaborator. They {{were joined by}} Pringsheim, who escaped from Belgium after the German invasion. Franck arranged a position for Pringsheim at his laboratory. Both his daughters and their families moved to the United States, {{and he was also}} able to bring out his elderly mother and aunt. He became a naturalised United States citizen on 21 July 1941, so he was not an enemy alien when the United States declared war on Germany on 11 December 1941. His daughters still were, though, so they were restricted from travelling, and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> care of their mother when she fell ill and died on 10 January 1942, although they were permitted to attend her funeral.|$|E

5|$|From 1967, a {{place in}} the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was awarded to the Football League Cup winners, but that season's winners, Queens Park Rangers, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> up their place because UEFA did not at that time allow third-tier teams to compete in the Fairs Cup. When the same {{situation}} arose two years later with Swindon Town, a two-legged match against that year's Coppa Italia winners, A.S. Roma, was organised by way of compensation. Following the popularity of that event, dubbed the Anglo-Italian League Cup, and as a way to generate income to pay players' wages during the extended close season caused by the 1970 FIFA World Cup, the first Anglo-Italian Cup was inaugurated in 1970.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of pipelaying, Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> place due to the frozen ground.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{protested that}} the British {{government}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> {{part in the}} kind of judicial enquiry Smith described, as its sovereignty could not be subject to any outside judgement and there was nothing to arbitrate anyway. Smith was again resolute: why, he queried, was Whitehall so adamant to avoid legal arbitration if its ministers were so sure they were right? He promised to drop the matter if such a panel ruled against him, but to no avail. Johnston said only that he would telegraph Whitehall to inform them that Reedman's appointment was imminent. Dupont confirmed it that afternoon, telling the Rhodesian Legislative Assembly that the mission had been accepted by Portugal.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 14 September, Hitler and his command held a conference at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin to discuss the future direction of the war. Göring was not present; he was inspecting Luftwaffe units in Belgium. Erhard Milch replaced him. Hitler praised the attacks which had caused heavy damage to the RAF and London. He blamed the failure to achieve more decisive results on the weather. Nevertheless, {{it was clear to}} Hitler that victory had still not been attained by the Luftwaffe. Under those circumstances, Operation Sea Lion <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> place. Großadmiral Erich Raeder, commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine, agreed. He argued that Sea Lion should only be carried out as a last resort regardless of gaining air superiority.|$|E
5|$|The Afghan Emir {{was warned}} by New Delhi of the {{approach}} of the expedition even while efforts were underway to intercept it in the Persian desert. After it crossed into Afghanistan, the Emir was asked to arrest the members. However, Habibullah humoured the British without obeying the Viceroy's requests. He told the Viceroy that he intended to remain neutral and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> any actions that were overtly pro-British. Indian intelligence became aware—after the expedition had already been Kabul for some time—that they carried with them highly inflammatory letters from the Kaiser and the Turkish Sultan. Through British channels, the Russians voiced their concerns about the Emir's tolerance of the German presence and their intrigues with Pro-German Afghan counsellors.|$|E
5|$|The Grenztruppen {{were closely}} watched {{to ensure that}} they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> {{advantage}} of their inside knowledge to escape across the border. Patrols, watchtowers and observation posts were always manned by two or three guards at a time. They were not allowed to go out of each other's sight in any circumstances. If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot him without hesitation or prior warning; 2,500 did escape to the West, 5,500 more were caught and imprisoned for up to five years, and a number were shot and killed or injured in the attempt.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{arrived in}} England for the 51st Ashes series in 1981. Willis, who was {{selected}} to play in all six Test matches, came into the series on a run of good county form. He had played four county matches, commencing with 5/61 against Yorkshire on 6 May, and 3/58 against Lancashire on 10 June. The first Test took place at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, on 18 June. England, batting first, were cut down for 185 all out thanks to four wickets for Terry Alderman and three a-piece for Dennis Lillee and Rodney Hogg. Only Mike Gatting passed fifty, and Willis was dismissed for a first-ball duck. Willis, however, combined with Dilley, Hendrick and Botham to reduce Australia to 179 all out, with three wickets for Willis. England <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> advantage, however, as Lillee and Alderman shared the host nation's ten wickets equally between them to leave Australia only 132 to win. Dilley took four wickets and Willis snatched Graeme Wood for eight to reach 200 Test wickets, however the tourists won the match with four wickets to spare.|$|E
5|$|Danny Baranowsky, the game's {{composer}} and who previously worked with McMillen on Super Meat Boy, was involved early {{on with the}} project shortly {{after the completion of}} the first prototype. McMillen and Baranowsky worked back and forth, with McMillen providing artwork from the game and allowing Baranowsky to develop the musical themes based on that; this would often lead to McMillen creating more art to support the music as it progressed. Baranowsky had been drawn to The Binding of Isaac as though the game puts forth a dark tone, he stated it had rather silly undertones underneath and such that one <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> it too seriously. Some of the songs were inspired by classical choral music but modified to fit the theme of the game. Other works were inspired by boss fight songs composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the Final Fantasy series. Baranowsky also had additional time after finishing the main songs for the game to craft short additional tracks that were used for special rooms like shops and secret areas.|$|E
5|$|Due to ill health, Blackburn <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> {{an active}} part in the {{campaign}}. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, while much of the campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. Republicans, who had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled charges that Republicans favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by William O'Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through gerrymandering election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.|$|E
