2500|$|When the diver {{starts to}} inhale, {{the removal of}} gas from the <b>casing</b> <b>lowers</b> the {{pressure}} inside the chamber, and the external water pressure moves the diaphragm inwards operating a lever. This lifts the valve off its seat, releasing gas into the chamber. The inter-stage gas, at about [...] over ambient pressure, expands through the valve orifice as its pressure is reduced to ambient and supplies the diver with more gas to breathe. When the diver stops inhaling the chamber fills until the external pressure is balanced, the diaphragm returns to its rest position and the lever releases the valve to be closed by the valve spring and gas flow stops.|$|R

50|$|The town of Certaldo {{is divided}} into upper and <b>lower</b> <b>parts.</b> The <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> is called Certaldo Basso, whilst the medieval upper part is called Certaldo Alto. Certaldo Alto has limited {{vehicular}} access, for use by residents only.

5000|$|Prior to 1910, a shell, made of {{dynamite}} and a sheet metal <b>casing</b> were <b>lowered</b> into a well and detonated by a blasting cap with a fuse. [...] By 1918, the practice had evolved to use blasting gelatin, {{a mixture of}} nitroglycerin, guncotton and wood pulp.|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a container for the transportation and/or storage of workpieces, said container being separable longitudinally and consisting of an upper and a <b>lower</b> <b>part.</b> The invention {{is characterized by the}} fact that two end pieces are provided with an external contour whose smallest diameter is greater than that of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>parts,</b> of which at least one part bears a marking and that the two end pieces are connected to the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> {{in such a way that}} the marking has a specific position reference in relation to the internal contour of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>parts...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{tails of}} Hemigalinae species are ringed. The toes {{and the middle}} of the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the tarsus are bald. The frenum, upper part, and sides of the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> are hairy. The orbit is imperfect.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper part}} of Japanese islands was created {{at the edge of}} Eurasian plate 180 million years ago.Then, 50 million years later, the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> was created at the {{southern}} part of Yangtze continent. The <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> then rode on Izanagi plate and moved to the upper part. These islands were incorporated and formed the Japanese islands 70 million years ago. The boundary line between the upper <b>part</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> is the MTL.|$|R
30|$|Meanwhile, {{based on}} the theory of energy dissipation, results show that upper part of tunnel {{cross-section}} has larger wave energy dispersion than the points at <b>lower</b> <b>part,</b> which means plastic damage of upper part is more serious than the <b>lower</b> <b>part.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{perforating}} cutaneous nerve {{arises from}} the sacral plexus. It pierces the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the sacrotuberous ligament, and winds around the inferior border of the gluteus maximus. It supplies the skin covering the medial and <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> of gluteus maximus.|$|R
50|$|The middle thyroid vein (vena thyreoidea media) {{collects}} {{the blood}} from the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the thyroid gland, and after being joined by some veins from the larynx and trachea, ends in the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the internal jugular vein.|$|R
5000|$|The Frenchman is {{separated}} from the underlying formations by an erosional unconformity, and depending on {{the depth of the}} erosion, the Frenchman rests on the Whitemud Formation, the Battle Formation, the Eastend Formation, or the Bearpaw Formation. [...] It is equivalent in age to the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the Scollard Formation, the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the Willow Creek Formation, and the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the Coalspur Formation in Alberta, and the Hell Creek Formation in Montana and North Dakota.|$|R

25|$|The {{upper and}} <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> {{of the square}} used to be {{separated}} by a segment of City Centre Drive. However, pedestrian safety issues and commitment to building a vibrant downtown led the city council to permanently close this segment, uniting the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> of the square.|$|R
30|$|We applied PCA on {{a subset}} of markers: in the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the face (jaw, lips, and cheeks - see Figure 1). The {{movements}} of markers on the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the face are tightly connected to the speech gestures. As this synthesis technique was designed for neutral speech (affirmative sentences) and not expressive speech, markers on {{the upper part of}} the face move very little. We retained the 12 first principal components, which explain about 94 % of the variance of the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the face.|$|R
3000|$|... (1) A highly {{conductive}} {{region that}} extends to shallow levels beneath the Jigokudani valley. This conductor {{is divided into}} a conductive upper part and a less conductive <b>lower</b> <b>part.</b> The upper part most likely represents clayey sediments containing hydrothermal acid fluids, whereas the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> is probably associated {{with the presence of}} rather resistive volcanic gases. The less permeable nature of the clay in this area means that the upper clayey sediments act as a cap that stores the magmatic gases in the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of this zone.|$|R
5000|$|The EISA bus slot is a {{two-level}} staggered pin system, {{with the}} upper part of the slot corresponding to the standard ISA bus pin layout. The additional features of the EISA bus are implemented on the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the slot connector, using thin traces inserted into the insulating gap of the upper / ISA card card edge connector. Additionally the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the bus has five keying notches, so an ISA card with unusually long traces cannot accidentally extend down into the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the slot.|$|R
5000|$|A 15th-century Mass by a {{composer}} {{known only as}} Pycard found in the Old Hall manuscript (named for the English town {{in which it was}} eventually discovered), demonstrates the high sophistication and complexity of panisorhythmic techniques. The <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> have a recurring color and talea that unite the composition. The upper parts have four different talea, one for each major section of the composition. The rhythmic relationship between upper and <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> changes as the music progresses. Each quarter note in the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> equals 4 and Â½ quarter notes in the upper parts, creating an uneven ratio of 4:9 that causes the parts to lose synchronization. The <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> then steadily contracts in a series of Pythagorean proportions (12:9:8:6) until the parts come back into alignment [...]|$|R
