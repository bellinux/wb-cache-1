40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the nutrients digestibility, backfat composition, cut-up parts and organ weights of intact and castrated finishing pigs. Forty eight Large White male pigs with initial average weight of 36. 82 ± 0. 45 kg were randomly assigned to two treatments with each treatment consisting of three replicates of eight pigs each. Twenty four of the experimental animals were castrated while the remaining twenty four were left intact. Four pigs per replicate were selected and housed in metabolic cages to determine nutrient digestibility and carcass evaluation was performed when the pigs in each experimental group attained an average weight of 70 kg in order to verify the backfat composition, cut-up parts and organ weights. The experiment was arranged in a Completely Randomised Design. Dry matter intake, excreted faeces/dry matter intake, dry matter digestibility, crude protein digestibility, nitrogen intake, absorption and retention were significantly (P< 0. 05) influenced by state of boar. Castrated boars had higher mean values in these parameters except in excreted faeces/dry matter. Intact boars had higher significant (P< 0. 05) mean values in liver (1. 98 %), kidney (0. 20 %) and heart (0. 22 %) weights in comparison with the corresponding values (1. 57, 0. 12 and 0. 12 %, respectively) recorded for castrated boars. Subcutaneous fat depth and fat free index were significantly (P< 0. 05) influenced by state of boars. Intact boar recorded better value (49. 07) for fat free index when compared to 43. 46 obtained by the <b>castrated</b> <b>boar.</b> It was concluded that state of boar had effect on nutrient digestibilities, organ weights (liver, kidney and heart weights) and backfat deposits (subcutaneous fat depth and fat free index) of finishing pigs...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the effects of synthetic ACTH (1 – 24, tetracosactid) and porcine CRH on the plasma levels of cortisol and PGF 2 α metabolite in cycling gilts (n = 3) and <b>castrated</b> <b>boars</b> (n = 3). The experiments were designed as crossover studies for each gender separately. Each animal received, during three consecutive days; 1) ACTH (Synacthen ® Depot) at a dose of 10 μg/kg body weight in 5 ml physiological saline, 2) porcine CRH at a dose 0. 6 μg/kg body weight in 5 ml physiological saline or 3) physiological saline (5 ml). The test substances were administered via an indwelling jugular cannula in randomized order according to a Latin square. The administration of ACTH to cycling gilts resulted in concomitant elevations of cortisol and PGF 2 α metabolite with peak levels reached at 70. 0 ± 10. 0 and 33. 3 ± 6. 7 min, respectively. Similarly, the administration of ACTH to <b>castrated</b> <b>boars</b> resulted in concomitant elevation of cortisol and PGF 2 α metabolite with peak levels reached at 60. 0 ± 0. 0 and 20. 0 ± 0. 0 min, respectively.

It can be concluded that administration of synthetic ACTH (tetracosactid) to pigs caused a concomitant elevation of cortisol and PGF 2 α metabolite levels in both cycling gilts as well as <b>castrated</b> <b>boars.</b> The administration of CRH to pigs resulted in an elevation of cortisol levels in both cycling gilts and <b>castrated</b> <b>boars.</b> Conversely, PGF 2 α metabolite levels were not influenced by the administration of CRH either in cycling gilts or in <b>castrated</b> <b>boars.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: This {{research}} was started because Dutch food safety employees {{had the impression}} that more overfilled joints in pigs were observed since the trend of slaughtering more <b>boars</b> instead of <b>castrates.</b> Therefore the aim of the research became: Determine if there are more affected <b>boars</b> compared to <b>castrated</b> <b>boars</b> with joint problems. However due the present Dutch situation, the research question had to be altered because not enough <b>castrated</b> <b>boars</b> were slaughtered. Therefore the {{research was}} aimed to distinguish if there was difference in affected joints between boars and gilts. Furthermore this research was organized in order to evaluate what could be the underlying reason for the joint problems. Therefore also pathology evaluations were performed on random selected affected joints. This part of the research has to be considered as a good pilot for future research. Strong suspicions for osteochondrosis are present after the examinations, but no significant conclusion can be made. A lack of enough data made it impossible to do proper statistics. Also in order to confirm the suspicion which came up during the research, further microscopically research should have been done. This trial if interpenetrated as a pilot, can give a good advice what sort of research should be performed in the future to determine the underlying reason of overfilled joints in pigs...|$|R

Dexamethasone treatment caused a decrease (p less than 0. 05) in the number of pulsatile episodes of LH secretion in both gonadectomized boars and sows resulting in a significant decrease in mean concentrations.

40|$|ABSTRACT In this thesis, {{there were}} {{assessed}} basic nutrition values of meat from different animals. Beef meat (bulls, heifers and veal), pork meat (<b>castrates,</b> <b>boars</b> and gilts), rabbit meat and chicken meat {{were included in}} the experimental part. There were moisture, lipids, proteins, ash and hydroxyproline determinated. Attention was given especially to the content of lipids and moisture. The animals were compared in terms of their type and on the basis of possible differences between sex (beef and pork meat), breed (beef and rabbit meat) or between different parts of animals` body (chicken and rabbit meat). Individual types were also compared with each other. For human nutrition it is possible to recommend veal meat, which contained the least amount of fat, MLD from rabbit meat and chicken breasts. Pork meat from young animals is comparable to chicken breast as regards the content of fat. We should also not omit beef meat in our bill of fare. Thanks to breeder technology the beef is now lower in fat {{than it used to be}} and contains valuable matters of red meat...|$|R
40|$|A {{consumer}} {{study was}} performed in four EU countries to further clarify the acceptability of meat with boar taint. In Denmark, France, Italy and Poland, a total of 476 female consumers evaluated 8 meat patties from boars with varying levels of skatole (0. 10 – 0. 40 μg/g fat tissue) and androstenone (0. 47 – 2. 00 μg/g fat tissue), in a pair-wise comparison with patties from <b>castrates.</b> <b>Boar</b> meat patties were always less preferred than the castrate meat patties, regardless {{of the level of}} androstenone and skatole. Acceptability of the boar meat patties decreased with increasing skatole level. In samples with low skatole levels, higher levels of androstenone also reduced acceptability among androstenone sensitive consumers. No clear threshold levels for androstenone and skatole could be identified. Maps presenting the reduction in preference due to increasing levels of skatole and androstenone, and corrected for the general acceptance of the meat product were developed, taking into account androstenone sensitivity. Further work is needed, covering the whole range of androstenone and skatole levels found in entire male pigs and for a wider set of meat products...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} to develop an obese porcine model induced by a high-fat diet and {{determine}} effects of obesity on gene expression in subcutaneous fat tissue in this model. A total of 20 crossbred, <b>castrated</b> <b>boars</b> (20 kg body weight) were fed a corn-soy basal diet (Se adequate, total fat 80 kg) for 180 days. Results showed that pigs fed the high fat diet showed greater (p< 0. 05) body weight (146 vs. 121 kg), back fat thickness (3. 5 vs. 2. 3 cm) and abdominal fat content (3. 5 vs. 1. 9 kg), along with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, compared with the control pigs. About 387 genes {{were found to be}} significantly up-regulated and 465 genes down-regulated (fold change = 2. 0) in the high-fat diet group compared to the control group. To further characterize the response of gene type to high-fat diet in subcutaneous fat tissue, 852 genes significantly altered in response to high-fat diet were classified into Gene Ontology (GO) slim terms. Genes involved in metabolic process, immune response, translation and cell cycle were significantly up-regulated (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Corrigendum: [URL] {{animal health}} {{constraints}} {{have been identified}} as a major limiting factor in smallholder pig production in Uganda, researchers and policy makers lack information on the relative incidence of diseases and their impacts on pig production. This study aimed to assess animal health and management practices, constraints and opportunities for intervention in smallholder pig value chains in three high poverty districts of Uganda. Semi-qualitative interview checklists through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were administered to 340 pig farmers in 35 villages in Masaka, Kamuli and Mukono districts. Quantitative data was obtained during the exercise through group consensus. Results of FGDs were further triangulated with secondary data and information obtained from key informant interviews. Findings show that pig keeping systems are dominated by tethering and scavenging in rural areas. In peri-urban and urban areas, intensive production systems are more practiced, with pigs confined in pens. The main constraints identified by farmers include high disease burden such as African swine fever (ASF) and parasites, poor housing and feeding practices, poor veterinary services, ineffective drugs and a general lack of knowledge on piggery management. According to farmers, ASF is the primary cause of pig mortality with epidemics occurring mainly during the dry season. Worms and ectoparasites namely; mange, lice and flies are endemic leading to stunted growth which reduces the market value of pigs. Diarrhoea and malnutrition are common in piglets. Ninety-three percent of farmers say they practice deworming, 37 % practice ectoparasite spraying and 77 % <b>castrate</b> their <b>boars.</b> Indigenous curative treatments include the application of human urine and concoctions of local herbs for ASF control and use of old engine oil or tobacco extracts to control ectoparasites.

Thirty hybrid male pigs (50 % Meishan x 50 % Large White) were used. Fifteen were castrated within {{the first two days}} of age and the other fifteen remained entire. At 12 weeks of age, the pigs were divided into three groups, each consisting of five <b>castrates</b> and five <b>boars.</b> Animals were fed a basic standard commercial pelleted diet for 30, 60 or 90 days and then slaughtered, so that the actual age of the pigs at slaughter was 114, 144 and 174 days respectively. Parameters considered for carcass quality were carcass weight, initial pH (pH 45) and ultimate (final) pH (pHu), and P 2 backfat thickness. For pork and pork fat qualities, the following parameters were considered: backfat firmness, slip point, sensory attributes and adipose tissue fatty acid composition. Increasing age/weight significantly increased carcass weight and P 2 backfat thickness (P< 0. 01) and had a greater influence on tenderness and juiciness than sex (P< 0. 001).

40|$|The {{research}} focussed on {{the sensory}} perception of boar odour; an odour {{problem that is}} sometimes present in the meat of entire male pigs and associated with two compounds namely skatole and androstenone. Researchers differ {{on the issue of}} the relative contributions of skatole and androstenone to the sensory perception of boar odour. The first objective of the research was to investigate the relative contribution of different concentrations of skatole and androstenone to the temporal perception of boar odour in boar fat. In South Africa, the potential for boar odour was regarded to be considerable should it be decided to discontinue the policy of <b>castrating</b> <b>boars.</b> However, the economic advantages associated with boar production on the other hand necessitated an investigation into consumer reactions to boar odour. The second objective was therefore to determine the effects of gender and ethnicity on consumer reactions to boar odour in boar fat samples with different concentrations of skatole and androstenone. Pork fat samples from 50 boars slaughtered at a commercial abattoir were analysed for skatole and androstenone concentrations and grouped within a 3 x 3 matrix representing low, medium and high levels of the odour compounds. A 10 -member sensory panel, screened and trained to recognise and quantify skatole and androstenone odour intensities, was used to verify the human perception of boar odour in these pork fat samples immediately after heating (± 65 °C) and following a cooling period of ten minutes (± 25 °C). Consumers (n = 300) including equal numbers of males and females and from three ethnic groupings, namely blacks, whites and coloureds, were used to determine the effects of gender and ethnicity on consumer reactions towards boar odour compounds. Each consumer evaluated how much they would like to eat pork or pork products that smelled like the odour of each of 7 boar fat samples (65 °C) with different combinations of known concentrations of skatole and androstenone. The consumers were recruited on two university campuses and the results can therefore not be extrapolated to the general South African population since the majority of the participants were young (18 - 35 years) and representing living standards measures (LSM) groups 6 to 8, i. e. the higher income groups. It was shown that the trained sensory panel differentiated the odour of the pork fat samples first and foremost on the basis of the presence or absence of androstenone and/or skatole odours and secondly on the character of the androstenone or skatole odour. Sensory perception of boar odour seems to have a temporal character which can be explained by differences in volatilisation (involving both odourant release and retention) of skatole and androstenone, possibly enhanced by differences in the properties of the fat matrixes of different samples. The temperature and time at which the samples were evaluated influenced both the intensity and the character of the perceived odour profiles. For samples with skatole concentrations above 0. 25 µg/g and served warm, skatole was predominant while the influence of androstenone at levels above 0. 5 µg/g and other odour components became increasingly important after samples had cooled down and skatole volatiles were less evident. The results showed that females compared to males would be less willing to consume pork and pork products with detectable levels of boar odour pertaining to both skatole and androstenone. All groups would be less willing to consume pork and pork products with detectable concentrations of skatole or skatole and androstenone in combination. An apparent liking for samples with medium levels of androstenone (0. 5 to 1. 0 µ/g) was found for some consumers, especially males, and can be partly attributed to the inability of some consumers to smell this component or a genuine liking for the odour of androstenone. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) in the sensitivity of consumers from different ethnic groups were found with white females responding more negatively than white males and blacks. However, significant ethnic group effects were confounded by gender effects. The age of individuals, socio-economic factors and gender-linked personality factors may have influenced these differences. Although it was not possible to compare responses directly with the white and black groups because the samples were not identical, it was found that a higher percentage of coloureds responded negatively to boar odour compounds. Coloured males responded particularly negatively towards samples with detectable skatole, while black males, in general, were found to be more critical than black females. It was concluded that boar odour whether due to skatole, androstenone or both compounds in combination at the levels as currently found in South Africa, will contribute to negative consumer reactions, at least for the subsection of the population represented in the study. It was predicted that the majority of these consumers would be less willing to consume pork meat exhibiting detectable levels of boar odour. It was recommended that the policy of castration be continued until such time as methods have been developed to ensure reduction in both skatole and androstenone concentration levels of boars to levels that would not be detectable even to the most discerning of consumers.

We used RNA-seq analyses to determine the differential expression of genes and miRNAs in skeletal muscle. There were 99 differentially expressed genes identified (q[*]≤[*] 0. 05). The down-regulated genes were mainly involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism, including FABP 3, RCAN, PPARGC 1 (PGC- 1 A), HK 2 and PRKAG 2. The up-regulated genes were mainly involved in skeletal muscle differentiation and proliferation, including IGF 2, PDE 7 A, CEBPD, PIK 3 R 1 and MYH 6. Moreover, 15 differentially expressed miRNAs (|log 2 FC|[*]≥[*] 1, total reads count[*]≥[*] 20, p[*]≤[*] 0. 05) were identified. Among them, miR- 136, miR- 30 e- 5 p, miR- 1, miR- 208 b, miR- 199 a, miR- 101 and miR- 29 c were up-regulated, while miR- 215, miR- 365 - 5 p, miR- 486, miR- 1271, miR- 145, miR- 99 b, miR- 191 and miR- 10 b were down-regulated in low RFI pigs.

In this study, we examined whether or not CO 2 gas is capable of inducing an acceptable anaesthetic state during which castration can be performed. The first step was to identify the most promising CO 2 /O 2 mixture. Based on the results from this first experiment, a mixture of 70 % CO 2 + 30 % O 2 was chosen for further investigation as a potential anaesthetic during the castration of young piglets. Thereby, it was established whether the duration and depth of anaesthesia were acceptable for castration where the animal has to be insensible and unconscious. Physiological effects were assessed based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, blood gas values and behavioural responses. During the induction phase, the only typical behaviour the piglets exhibited when exposed to the 70 / 30 gas mixture was heavy breathing. All piglets (n = 25) lost consciousness after approximately 30 s according to the EEG. Heart rate decreased slowly during the induction phase, a serious drop occurred when piglets lost their posture. Immediately after this drop, the heart rate neared zero or showed a very irregular pattern. Shortly after loss of posture, most animals showed a few convulsions. None of the animals showed any reaction to castration in behaviour and/or on the EEG and ECG. On average, the piglets recovered within 59 s, i. e. EEG returned to its pre-induction pattern and piglets were able to regain a standing position. After 120 s, heart rate returned to pre-induction levels. In order to explore the usage range of CO 2 concentration, 24 piglets were exposed to 60 % CO 2 + 20 % O 2 + 20 % N 2 for up to 30 s after loss of consciousness (as registered on EEG), and castrated after removal from the chamber. Sixteen of the 24 animals showed a reaction to the castration on the EEG. To establish the maximum time piglets survive in 70 % CO 2 + 30 % O 2, five piglets were placed in this mixture for 3 min. Two of them died. After that, four piglets were placed in this mixture for 2 min after unconsciousness, one died after 2 min. It was concluded from this study {{that it is possible to}} anaesthetise piglets with a mixture of 70 % CO 2 + 30 % O 2, but that there are limits to its safety in terms of CO 2 concentration and duration of exposure. Before implementation for practical use, further research is essential to assess the limits of gas concentration and exposure time...|$|R
40|$|<b>Boars</b> are {{routinely}} <b>castrated</b> to prevent <b>boar</b> taint. In the past, genetic selection against boar taint influenced the testicular steroid production and delayed {{the onset of}} puberty. In this study, we assessed with a 2 × 2 design (genotype × gender) if the MC 4 R gene, a gene linked to daily gain and a possible marker for boar taint, has negative effects on reproduction, behaviour and skin lesions in gilts and boars. During the entire rearing period, boars showed more aggression (P< 0. 001), mounting behaviour (P< 0. 001) and anogenital sniffing (P< 0. 001) compared to gilts. As a consequence, boars had more skin lesions at their anterior part (P< 0. 001) and tail (P= 0. 016). Genotype affected boar behaviour when they were 22 weeks of age: boars of the GG genotype showed more aggressive behavior compared to AA boars (P= 0. 002). In addition, at 20 weeks of age, GG boars, but not gilts, had more skin lesions on their back, anterior and caudal part than AA boars. Around that age,we observed a peak in testosterone levels in both genotypes. Gender and genotype {{had no effect on}} lameness. The attainment of puberty of the boars was estimated by the presence of spermatozoa in a preputial smear sample collected weekly, from 10 weeks of age to slaughter. Genotype did not affect age (149 ± 12 days) or weight (94 ± 16 kg) of the boars at the onset of puberty, nor testosterone level. 31 % of the GG gilts, however, had cycling ovaries at slaughter compared to 8 % of the AA gilts. In conclusion, the polymorphism in the MC 4 R did not affect reproduction characteristics in boars but may influence puberty onset in gilts. There seems to be more aggression at the age of puberty of the GG boars compared to the AA boars, but the general effect of the marker on aggression remains unclear. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{performance}} of male pigs immunized against GnRH was determined {{in relation to the}} onset of their biological response to the immunization. Pigs were immunized at 9 and 17 wk of age and were housed in a pen together with both a surgically castrated and an intact boar littermate. Feed intake was restricted to 2. 8 to 3. 2 times maintenance requirement for energy. Animals were weighed weekly and slaughtered at 108 kg BW. Depending on the time of onset of the response after immunization in terms of biological effects, immunized pigs were retrospectively grouped into two categories. One category consisted of the immunized pigs, which had undetectable or low levels of LH and testosterone at the time of booster immunization—known as "early" responding immunocastrates (E-IM, n = 8), whereas the "late" responding immunocastrates (L-IM, n = 7) had substantial LH and testosterone levels at that time. This dichotomy of the response to immunization also was reflected in testis weight, with 17 g and 40 g for E-IM and L-IM pigs, respectively. At slaughter, testis size and weight were reduced (P < 0. 001) in the immunocastrated pigs as compared to the intact boars. Androstenone concentrations in backfat of all immunocastrated pigs were undetectable. Growth performance (i. e., ADG and feed efficiency [FE, g gain/kg feed]), was better in boars and L-IM pigs than in surgical castrates and E-IM pigs (P < 0. 05). Average daily gain and FE did not differ between E-IM pigs and the surgical <b>castrates,</b> but intact <b>boars</b> performed better than L-IM (P < 0. 02). There {{were no significant differences in}} carcass quality (backfat thickness and meat percentage) between <b>boars</b> and surgical <b>castrates</b> at slaughter. However, for both characteristics L-IM pigs and intact boars performed better (P < 0. 03) than E-IM pigs. Thus, growth performance in L-IM is better than in either E-IM or surgical castrates...|$|R
40|$|Male piglets are <b>castrated</b> {{to reduce}} <b>boar</b> taint {{and also to}} reduce {{aggressive}} and sexual behaviour. However, the procedure as traditionally performed is painful and negatively affects performance. Large-scale results {{about the consequences of}} implementing alternatives on farms are lacking. We, therefore, investigated the practical applicability of the following five alternatives that can be implemented in the short term: surgical castration (1) without pain relief (CONT, control group), (2) with analgesia (MET, Metacam, 0. 2 ml, 10 to 15 min before castration), (3) with general anaesthesia (CO 2, inhalation, 100 % CO 2, 25 s, 3 l/min), (4) vaccination against boar taint (IM, two injections with Improvac) and (5) production of entire males (EM). The study consisted of the following two trials: (1) an experimental farm trial with 18 animals/treatment and (2) a large field trial on 20 farms with similar to 120 male pigs/farm per treatment and all treatments performed on each farm. Performance results as well as data on carcass traits, boar taint (hot-iron method) and testes development and weight were collected in both trials. Neither castration nor administration of analgesia or anaesthesia had an effect on daily gain of the piglets in the farrowing crates (P> 0. 05). Farmer records indicated that mortality in the farrowing crates (1. 1 %), nursery pens (1. 8 %) and fattening stable (2. 2 %) was not influenced by MET or CO 2 compared with EM, IM or CONT (P> 0. 05). No significant differences were found for daily gain (P> 0. 05) nor slaughter age (P> 0. 05). Immunocastrates and EM had a better gain-to-feed ratio (P< 0. 05) compared with the groups of barrows (CONT, MET and CO 2). Lean meat percentage was higher for EM compared with the barrows, and intermediate for IM (P< 0. 05). Carcass yield was lowest for IM (P< 0. 05). The hot-iron method indicated that boar taint was eliminated in barrows and IM compared with EM (P< 0. 001). Average prevalence of strong boar taint was 3 % for EM, but varied from 0 % to 14 % between farms. As the effect of treatment on performance as well as the level of boar taint of EM was farm dependent, farmers should be encouraged to pre-test the different alternatives {{in order to make a}} well-considered choice for the best practical and profitable alternative for their farm...|$|R
40|$|End {{of project}} reportThe studies {{presented}} in this report were conducted to investigate the effect of breed, slaughter weight, castration of male pigs and strategic feeding strategies {{on the performance of}} pigs to slaughter and on their carcass quality. The effect of breed, gender and feeding regimen on the performance of pigs and their carcass quality was examined in the first study (Section 3). From weaning to slaughter Landrace-sired pigs grew at a similar rate but had a better feed conversion efficiency compared with Duroc-sired pigs. Landrace-sired pigs also had a higher carcass lean and greater muscle depth than Duroc-sired pigs. Entire male pigs grew more efficiently, had lower lean content in their carcasses and had a reduced kill out yield when compared with gilts. The eye muscle depth was greater for gilts than entire males. Diluting the diet with grass-meal (GM) reduced growth rate, caused a deterioration in feed conversion efficiency, reduced back fat thickness, reduced eye muscle thickness and reduced kill out yield compared to the control feeding regimen of a cereal based diet. Compensatory growth was observed during a re-alimentation period following a period of diet dilution with grass-meal. However, where it did occur, in most cases it was only partial. Adding 5 % rapeseed oil instead of lard to the finisher diet increased nitrogen utilization efficiency and phosphorous utilization efficiency. The effect of gender (<b>boar,</b> <b>castrate,</b> gilt) and slaughter weight (80 to 120 kg) on pig performance, carcass quality, meat quality, and nitrogen excretion was investigated in the second study (Section 4). Boars grew faster than gilts and more efficiently than castrates or gilts. Castrates had a higher kill out yield than boars. Nitrogen excretion from castrates was similar to gilts which were both higher than that from boars. The processing value of carcasses from castrates may be higher than that of boars and gilts. In particular castrates had heavier loins and bellies than either boars or gilts. Carcasses from castrates and gilts had a higher temperature (recorded 24 hours post slaughter) than boars. However, pH 24 was not affected by gender. The intramuscular fat content of the l. dorsi in castrates was higher than that of boars or gilts, however at 1. 65 % this was well below the level (2. 0 %) above which any noticeable sensory attributes might be detected. Feed intake increased with increasing slaughter weight and feed conversion efficiency deteriorated. N excretion also increased with each increment in weight. Carcass lean content increased up to 90 kg live EOP 4939. doc 4 25 / 10 / 2005 weight then reached a plateau and declined after 110 kg live weight. Heavier carcasses yielded more product for approximately the same slaughtering cost and the associated larger muscles could make it easier to use seam butchery techniques that result in lean, well-trimmed, attractive cuts and joints. The pH 45 and pH 24 were reduced with increasing slaughter weight and drip loss increased. Heavier pigs may be more prone to the development of PSE than lighter pigs as their carcass temperature remains higher for longer than that of lighter pigs...|$|R
