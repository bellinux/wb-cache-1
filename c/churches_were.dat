5|$|Gotland {{began to}} {{gradually}} abandon Norse religion and adopt Christianity during the 11th century. While the earliest <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> wooden, construction of stone churches began during the 12th century. The church building period was fairly short; {{in the countryside}} stone <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> erected between the early 12th and mid-14th centuries, while in Visby the last <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> inaugurated during the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Burges's two finest gothic <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> also {{undertaken}} in the 1870s, the Church of Christ the Consoler, Skelton-on-Ure, and St Mary's, Studley Royal. His patron, George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon, although not as rich as Bute, was his equal in romantic medievalism and had been a friend of Bute's at Oxford, which {{may account for the}} choice of Burges as architect. Both <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> built as memorial churches for Ripon's brother-in-law, Frederick Grantham Vyner, who was murdered by Greek bandits in 1870. Vyner's mother commissioned the Church of Christ the Consoler and his sister St Mary's. Both begun in 1870, Skelton was consecrated in 1876 and Studley Royal in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Local <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> further {{organized}} into geographically defined presbyteries. A presbytery was {{a convention of}} all ministers within its jurisdiction and one ruling elder chosen by each session. Collegiate <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> entitled to be represented by two or more ruling elders {{in proportion to the}} number of its pastors. Presbyteries were responsible for examining, licensing and ordaining candidates to the ministry, as well as judging and removing ministers. They were also responsible for resolving doctrinal or disciplinary questions and also functioned as courts of appeal from sessions. An executive commission was appointed to more efficiently manage the presbytery's work, and judicial cases were referred to a judicial commission.|$|E
50|$|The present <b>church</b> <b>is</b> {{the fourth}} <b>church</b> to <b>be</b> built at this site. The first <b>church</b> <b>was</b> a stave <b>church</b> and it <b>is</b> first written about in {{historical}} records in 1306. The next <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1604 and it <b>was</b> a wooden <b>church</b> that <b>was</b> in use until 1859 {{when it was}} torn down. The third <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1860 and it <b>was</b> a cruciform <b>church</b> which <b>was</b> struck by lightning and burned down a mere three {{years after it was}} built. The fourth (and present) <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1863.|$|R
50|$|St John the Baptist <b>Church.</b> This <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1720, {{at the same}} time that the St. Nicholas <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built, {{although}} the difference between the types of architecture of the two <b>churches</b> <b>is</b> quite remarkable. Whereas the St. Nicholas <b>Church</b> <b>is</b> all wooden, the St. John <b>Church</b> <b>is</b> made out of white plastered walls with wooden supports.|$|R
5000|$|The Church of the Epiphany <b>is</b> Lauren’s oldest <b>church</b> {{building}} still operating. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed in}} 1846. [...] The First United Methodist Church represents Romanesque Revival architecture. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1897. In 1834, the First Baptist <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> originally built. The {{name of the}} original <b>church</b> <b>was</b> Laurensville Baptist <b>Church.</b> In 1850, the first sanctuary was built. In 1893, the second <b>church</b> <b>was</b> constructed. The present sanctuary was built in 1958. The First Presbyterian <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> organized on April 1, 1832, but the present <b>church</b> structure <b>was</b> built in 1891. The first preacher of the <b>church</b> <b>was</b> Samuel B. Lewers. He served the church for eighteen years. The <b>church</b> <b>is</b> built {{in the style of}} Victorian Gothic Revival architecture.|$|R
5|$|The oldest {{churches in}} the city centre, the Ascension and St Dimitri <b>churches,</b> <b>were</b> built in the 18th century, after the 1689 Great Fire. They were both renovated in the 19th century. The Church of the Ascension is {{particularly}} small it is half-buried {{in order not to}} overlook neighbouring mosques. In the 19th century, several new <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> built, including the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, which is a large three-nave building designed by Andrey Damyanov.|$|E
5|$|The stave churches {{owe their}} {{longevity}} to architectural innovations that protected these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most {{important was the}} introduction of massive sills underneath the staves (posts) {{to prevent them from}} rotting. Over the two centuries of stave church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced art and science. After the Reformation, however, no new stave <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> built. New <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old stave churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, or because they were too small to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{traces of}} the fabric of the {{original}} clas church. Most buildings in the sixth century were of wood, wattle and daub. Even <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> wooden. Although the use of stone was not unknown elsewhere in Britain at this time, it was not used in Wales (it was rare anywhere in Britain until the eleventh century). <b>Churches</b> <b>were</b> also distinguished by their comparatively small size and simplicity. They tended to be under 40 feet long, with a single tall, aisleless nave, and with a small square chancel attached. They were often oratories, rather than full churches.|$|E
50|$|This <b>church</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} <b>church</b> on this site. The first known <b>church</b> <b>was</b> a stave <b>church</b> from the 13th century. A second <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built around the}} year 1600, and the third (and present) <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1868.|$|R
50|$|The white, wooden <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1866 {{to replace the}} old Sauda <b>Church</b> which <b>was</b> located in the nearby village of Saudasjøen (the old <b>church</b> <b>was</b> torn down after this <b>church</b> <b>was</b> completed). The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built using designs by the famous church {{architect}} Hans Linstow. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> consecrated on 26 September 1866 by the parish priest P. R. Hoffgaard {{on behalf of the}} Bishop Jacob von der Lippe.|$|R
50|$|In 1670, {{the first}} Kaarli <b>Church</b> (Charles's <b>Church)</b> <b>was</b> built here, {{named after the}} Swedish king Charles XI. The wooden <b>church</b> <b>was</b> for Estonians and local Finns. That <b>church</b> <b>was</b> burned down during the Great Northern War in August 1710. The {{short-lived}} second <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in the 19th century, but was torn down when the third Kaarli <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1870.|$|R
5|$|With {{the merger}} in 1939 of the Methodist Episcopal (M.E.) and Methodist Protestant (M.P.) {{denominations}} in the U.S., Towson's Methodist Episcopal and Methodist Protestant <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> known thereafter as First Methodist Church and Second Methodist Church, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Although most residences {{were built}} {{according}} to local vernacular traditions, some manors (such as Austråt and Rosendal) exhibit the influence of Baroque architecture. Only the city of Christiania (Oslo) had a building code that prohibited wooden houses, {{and a number of}} large town houses modeled after Continental building types were constructed. Some large <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> constructed with brick walls, notably in Bergen, Christiania, Røros and Kongsberg.|$|E
5|$|Armenian <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> {{constructed}} {{during that}} period, including the St. James Monastery. The latter was last expanded in the mid-12th century. An Armenian scriptorium was in operation by the mid-fifth century. A secular community composed of merchants and artisans {{was established in}} the sixth century in the Zion Quarter, where an Armenian street existed (Ruda Armeniorum).|$|E
50|$|The first Austevoll <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} the middle ages on the small island of Sandtorv. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> torn down and moved to Austevollshella on the island of Hundvåko in the 1650s. That <b>church</b> <b>was</b> in use for over 200 years. In 1891, the <b>church</b> <b>was</b> torn down and a new church (the present <b>church)</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt on the nearby island of Huftarøy in the village of Storebø. This new <b>church</b> <b>was</b> consecrated on 22 January 1891 by the Bishop Waldemar Hvoslef.|$|R
2500|$|The present <b>church</b> <b>is</b> {{the fourth}} <b>church</b> to <b>be</b> built at this site.

50|$|A new <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built on}} the same site to replace the old <b>church.</b> This <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} in 1726 {{and it was a}} timber framed <b>church.</b> That <b>church</b> <b>was</b> used until 1888 when it too was torn down {{to make room for the}} present <b>church</b> which <b>is</b> much larger. The present <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1888 by the architects Solheim and Tengesdal. The white, wooden <b>church</b> <b>was</b> consecrated on 18 July 1888.|$|R
5|$|Brașov and its surroundings, {{including}} the city's Black Church, were severely affected. According to local chronicles, {{in the village}} of Bod, more than 50 houses and several <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> damaged or destroyed. In Feldioara, a column of water rose several meters into the air from a crack caused by the earthquake. Buildings collapsed in Sibiu, {{including the}} city's Catholic church.|$|E
5|$|Brownhills has {{had strong}} {{links with the}} Methodist faith since the 19th century. The current Silver Street Methodist church {{was built in the}} 1960s when two other <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> compulsorily {{purchased}} and demolished due to their sites being identified as prime locations for additional town centre car parking under a council redevelopment scheme.|$|E
5|$|Devotional art {{before the}} Reformation {{included}} books and images commissioned in the Netherlands. Before the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century the interiors of Scottish <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> often elaborate and colourful, with sacrament houses and monumental effigies. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll {{as a result}} of Reformation iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings.|$|E
50|$|The stave <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{demolished}} in 1710, and {{a wooden}} cruciform <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built on the}} site. This was demolished in 1858, and the present <b>church</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1859. The present <b>church</b> <b>is</b> a cruciform <b>church</b> with a tower above the main entrance.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>church</b> at Skånevik <b>was</b> {{built before}} 1340. That <b>church</b> <b>was</b> a stave <b>church,</b> and <b>was</b> in use until 1683 {{when it was}} {{demolished}} and replaced by a timber-framed church built by Olle Bysemb and Erich Fyllingsnes. In 1900 the second <b>church</b> <b>was</b> demolished after a new <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built a close by. The third <b>church</b> <b>is</b> still in use.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>church</b> <b>is</b> a {{cruciform}} basilica with {{a western}} tower. The original <b>church</b> <b>was</b> destroyed in 1467 by Burgundian troops. A new <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built and subsequently devastated by fire in 1584 during the Eighty Years' War. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> restored in 1592. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> again destroyed in 1654, {{this time by}} Lorraine troops. [...] The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt and deacon Adriaen Wuestenraed {{played a major role}} in this reconstruction. In 1695 the church and the interior were completed. The interior was executed in Baroque style.|$|R
5|$|Dissenting {{religious}} practitioners also widely {{resented the}} treatment {{they received from}} the Lutheran State Church through the Conventicle Act. Conflicts between local worshipers and the new <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> most explosive in the countryside, where dissenting pietist groups were more active, and were more directly under the eye of local law enforcement and the parish priest. Before non-Lutheran <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> granted toleration in 1809, clampdowns on illegal forms of worship and teaching often provoked whole groups of pietists to leave together, intent on forming their own spiritual communities in the new land. The largest contingent of such dissenters, 1,500 followers of Eric Jansson, left in the late 1840s and founded a community in Bishop Hill, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Sixty {{villages and}} about 40 <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> {{destroyed}} in the southwest Salmas Plain and the surrounding mountainous regions. In the zone of heaviest damage (bounded by the villages of Kohneh Shahr, Payajuk and Zaviehjuk) all the homes and {{all but one of}} the <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> destroyed. To the east of this area, the large village of Dilman reportedly had 1,100 casualties, but seismologists J. S. Tchalenko and M. Berberian questioned the reliability of this figure. In smaller villages, survivors provided an accurate count of those lost because they remembered the victims by name, but in a village of 18,000, survivors were unable to grasp the extent of the losses. Only two homes remained standing there, and the village was renamed Salmas and moved to a new location to the west.|$|E
5|$|The Safavid emperor Tahmasp I ransacked {{the monastery}} in 1534. In 1648, {{along with other}} {{buildings}} in the region, Varagavank was destroyed by an earthquake. Its restoration began immediately thereafter by monastery father Kirakos who found financial support among the wealthy merchants in Van. According to the 17th-century historian Arakel of Tabriz, four <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> restored and renovated.|$|E
50|$|There <b>are</b> four <b>churches</b> in Pleasanton. The Pleasanton United Methodist <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1899. Grace Lutheran <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> {{established in}} 1906. St. Mary's Catholic <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1909, and then {{replaced with a}} new church in 1960. Pleasanton Evangelical Free <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> established in 1982.|$|R
50|$|St Lucia's <b>Church</b> <b>is</b> a {{foundation}} of unknown age, originally built in Early English style. The old <b>church</b> <b>was</b> taken down in 1867. The new <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built upon a better site in Norman style. The vestry in the current <b>church</b> <b>was</b> re-erected from the old church.|$|R
50|$|There has <b>been</b> a <b>church</b> in Utåker {{since the}} Middle Ages. The <b>church</b> <b>is</b> first named in {{historical}} records in 1360 {{and at that}} time the <b>church</b> <b>was</b> not new. That <b>church</b> <b>was</b> a stave <b>church.</b> It <b>was</b> eventually torn down and the present white, wooden <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1882. The church seats about 200 people.|$|R
5|$|The first stone {{churches in}} Norway were Romanesque, built under the {{influence}} of Anglo-Saxon missionaries, particularly bishop Nicholas Breakspear. Later <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> influenced by Continental architecture. Examples include the churches at Ringsaker, Kviteseid, and elsewhere. Many of these churches have either been lost or rebuilt in the Gothic style, but numerous examples still exist, notably the Trondenes Churchat Trondenesin Troms.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} from Saxon times of Christian churches {{and at the}} time of the Civil War a Puritan and nonconformist presence in the town. The Unitarians were among the early dissenting congregations which eventually included Methodists, Baptists, Seventh Day Adventist and other denominations. More than forty <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> built during the Victorian era, but some have now been closed, demolished or converted to other uses.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{official}} estimate, 1,044 {{people were killed}} during the 2002 Gujarat riots790 Muslims and 254 Hindus. Another 223 people were reported missing, 2,548 were injured, 919 women were widowed and 606 children were orphaned. When people missing after the riots were declared dead after seven years, total deaths rose from 1,044 to 1,267 Unofficial estimates put the death toll closer to 5,000, with Muslims forming the majority. Police records say that 298 dargahs, 205 mosques, 17 temples and three <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> damaged during the riots.|$|E
50|$|The white, stone <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built around}} the year 1200. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> located on Veøya due to the {{importance}} of the great Romsdalsfjorden during the Viking Age. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> used for centuries until 1901 when a royal decree was handed down to discontinue its active use. The <b>church</b> continued to <b>be</b> used until 1907 when the new Veøy <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> built on the mainland. The new <b>church</b> <b>was</b> located there so that residents of the parish could more easily reach the church. The old <b>church</b> <b>is</b> now preserved as a historic site and it is no longer regularly used. The <b>church</b> <b>is</b> now jointly owned by the parish, the municipality, and the Romsdal Museum.|$|R
5000|$|The wooden <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1883 {{to serve the}} people in the Heim area since the trip to the main Hemne <b>Church</b> in Kyrksæterøra <b>was</b> long and that <b>church</b> <b>was</b> full to capacity.
