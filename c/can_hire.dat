5|$|Cullompton United Charities {{provides}} {{a number of}} charitable services to residents of Cullompton. The majority of the funds come from bequests made to the parish from the seventeenth century onwards. Thirteen separate charities were combined in 1921 and then in 1953 further amalgamation went on with the Trott's almshouses, John Lanes Charity and the Charity of George Spicer combining to form the current United Charities. There are nine local almshouses which are available to local residents {{over the age of}} 55. They also offer Alpha Piperline emergency call services for the elderly, can refund up to £100 to school leavers under 25 who have spent money equipping themselves with tools, books, vocational training or further education and offer financial help needy individuals resident in the parish to help them purchase specific items. They also own a building called Community House in the town centre, where local organisations <b>can</b> <b>hire</b> meeting rooms.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Harebrained Schemes {{announced}} that it would be producing a new Shadowrun role-playing video game, Shadowrun Returns, to be funded through Kickstarter. As a result of the Kickstarter appeal reaching a 1.5 million dollar target, Shadowrun original creator and FASA Corporation's founder Jordan Weisman {{announced that}} the game would now feature an additional storyline tying in the new game with both the SNES game and the Sega Genesis game. This extra content was initially made available only to backers, becoming generally available some time after release. The protagonist of the SNES game, Jake Armitage, is featured in Shadowrun Returns as both part of the game's main plotline and as an NPC that the player <b>can</b> <b>hire</b> to accompany them on various missions.|$|E

5|$|The game {{starts with}} a {{character}} creation screen where the player can choose items for their playable character, such as their physical appearance, race and creed. The player can choose to play {{as one of the}} eleven available classes: fighter, barbarian, paladin, ranger, wizard, druid, monk, priest, rogue, chanter and cipher. Each of them make the gameplay different; for example, the cipher can use the soul of an enemy in order to attack them, and druids can shapeshift into a beast and cast spells. The protagonist's class can also influence the number of available dialogue options. The player may adventure with up to five other characters {{out of a total of}} eight that they can pick up on their travels. These are fleshed out characters with unique personalities and appearances. Additionally, the protagonist <b>can</b> <b>hire</b> party members which the player creates in local taverns, but at a monetary cost.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, {{school fees}} for grades 1 to 10 were officially {{abolished}} but hidden costs remained. Other costs include loss of children's wages or unpaid labour for agriculture, tending livestock or housework. Whether children work depends on relative household wealth. Labour-intensive assets such as farms <b>can</b> <b>hire</b> labour if they generate sufficient profit but poorer households may need {{their children to}} help with these assets. This can relate to family size, with larger families sending their younger children to school because older children can help their parents. Attendance is reduced when children have to travel long distances to school since this increases personal risk and transport costs. There are also cultural attitudes against educating girls since education will only benefit her husband's household.|$|E
25|$|European {{constitutional}}/absolute monarchies. Liechtenstein and Monaco are constitutional monarchies {{in which}} the Prince theoretically retains many powers of an absolute monarch. In reality, he is a figurehead who is expected not to use that power. For example, the 2003 Constitution referendum which gives the Prince of Liechtenstein the power to veto any law that the Landtag (parliament) proposes and the Landtag can veto any law that the Prince tries to pass. The Prince <b>can</b> <b>hire</b> or dismiss any elective member or government employee {{from his or her}} post. However, what makes him not an absolute monarch is that the people can call for a referendum to end the monarchy's reign. When Crown Prince Alois threatened to veto a referendum to legalize abortion in 2011 (which didn't actually happen), voters were surprised because the Prince hasn't vetoed any law for over 3 decades. The Prince of Monaco has simpler powers but cannot hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post, but he can elect the minister of state, government council and judges. Both Albert II and Hans-Adam II are theoretically very powerful, but in practice even they have very limited power compared to the Islamic monarchs (see below). They also own huge tracts of land and are shareholders in many companies.|$|E

500|$|The player {{begins a}} game by {{choosing}} a character class for the protagonist. [...] The choices are warrior, knight, mage, priest, and ranger. [...] Each class has an affinity {{to a certain}} class of soldierwarriors are more apt in leading infantry, and knights, cavalry. [...] During battles, mages, rangers, and priests can also cast spells that damage foes, alter terrain, and heal friendly forces. [...] The player <b>can</b> <b>hire</b> commanders of these classes to accompany the protagonist in his quest. [...] After winning a number of battles, the player's character might receive offers of service from such commanders as well.|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} {{feature of}} the northern section of the park is a boating lake. This has been in situ since a tender to install a [...] lake with {{an island in the}} centre was accepted in August 1880. An approach to Joseph Swan to illuminate the lake received no response, but a further approach to John Hancock to design the lake edge was more successful; the lake edge today still follows Hancock's original design. Model boating has been a fixture of the lake since 1886 and the Saltwell Park Model Boat Club is the latest organisation to use the lake for this purpose. The island in the centre of the lake was in 1909 home to a bandstand, and visiting performers were required to travel by boat to the island, but the bandstand was moved to the Saltwell Grove section of the park in 1921. During the summer months, visitors <b>can</b> <b>hire</b> rowing boats and pedalos for use on the lake. The lake has long been inhabited by mallards and tufted ducks and it is also home to several other species of wildfowl, including swans, Canada and barnacle geese, coots and moorhens. Common pochard and grebe also inhabit the lake in winter after migrating from Russia and central Europe. Kingfisher are also reported to have returned to the lake after a lengthy absence.|$|E

2500|$|Danes enjoy a high {{standard}} of living and the Danish economy is characterised by extensive government welfare provisions. Like other Nordic countries, Denmark has adopted the Nordic Model, which combines free market capitalism with a comprehensive welfare state and strong worker protection. As {{a result of its}} acclaimed [...] "flexicurity" [...] model, Denmark has the most free labour market in Europe, according to the World Bank. Employers <b>can</b> <b>hire</b> and fire whenever they want (flexibility), and between jobs, unemployment compensation is very high (security). Establishing a business can be done {{in a matter of hours}} and at very low costs. No restrictions apply regarding overtime work, which allows companies to operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Denmark has a competitive corporate tax rate of 24.5% and a special time-limited tax regime for expatriates. The Danish taxation system is broad based, with a 25% value-added tax, in addition to excise taxes, income taxes and other fees. The overall level of taxation (sum of all taxes, as a percentage of GDP) is estimated to be 46% in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Some years later, at the Leveson Inquiry in February 2012, Dacre {{rejected}} {{the idea that he}} imposes his will on the paper. He commented that some issues contain opinions which [...] "make my hair go white" [...] and asserted that some journalists [...] "would resign if I told them what to write". He once suggested in general terms to a new employee, sports' columnist Des Kelly, the best way to write for readers: [...] "Make them laugh, make them cry, or make them angry". Peter Preston noted: [...] "He <b>can</b> <b>hire</b> leading voices from the Guardian or the Observer and let them say exactly what they'd have said in their old homes." [...] James Chapman, in an interview with GQ magazine defending Dacre, pointed to his newspaper's campaign to close down the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and opposition to Kenneth Clarke's proposal for secret courts. The astrologer Jonathan Cainer was first taken on for a Mail horoscope column in December 1992. Given to an unconventional dress code Dacre found objectionable, his contract had a clause insisting he wore a suit. Cainer, who spent the bulk of his career at the Mail although he [...] "never once agreed with an editorial they have published", was the highest paid journalist of his era.|$|E
2500|$|The Sheriff of the NC {{county is}} the highest ranking law {{enforcement}} officer {{in each of the}} state's 100 counties and has complete at-will power to hire and terminate personnel at his-her will and pleasure. Deputies and jailers serve a term concurrent with the sheriff, not to exceed 4 years and must be re-sworn every 4 years. Jailers are custodial officers and must complete a 160-hour jailer training course, though some are also dually trained and sworn as deputies. Deputies must complete the state mandated 600+ hour Basic Law Enforcement Training (BLET) course, or do a [...] "re-entry" [...] or reentry syllabus for former or lateral (out of state officers). Other than the reentry option, the training for deputies is the same as for police officers, and other peace officers to be certified. The sheriff however, <b>can</b> <b>hire</b> deputies and has one year to get them trained and certified. This allows a sheriff who comes in office to, if he-she chooses, to replace an entire or partial department with untrained appointees and there is then one year to get the new deputies trained and certified. Deputies are a political extension of the sheriff and have no independent statutory power and when an arrest or action is made in an official capacity, it is done {{in the name of the}} sheriff as a de facto power of attorney. This is why legally, a sheriff, unlike a police chief, can dismiss arrests and charges filed by deputies for any or no reason, and this is done frequently for political purposes, Police chiefs cannot do so, as the officers are a separate and distinct legal entity named in legislation, ...|$|E
