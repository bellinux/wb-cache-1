40|$|In large {{decentralized}} {{institutions such}} as MIT, finding information about events and activities on a campus-wide basis can be a strenuous task. This is mainly due to the ephemeral nature of events and the inability to impose a <b>centralized</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> to all event organizers and target audiences. For the purpose of advertising events, Email is the communication medium of choice. In particular, there is a wide-spread use of electronic mailing lists to publicize events and activities. These {{can be used as}} a valuable source for information mining. This dissertation will propose two mining architectures to find category-specific event announcements broadcasted on public MIT mailing lists. At the center of these mining systems is a text classifier that groups Emails based on their textual content. Classification is followed by information extraction where labeled data, such as the event date, is identified and stored along with the Email content in a searchable database. The first architecture is based on a probabilistic classification method, namely naive-Bayes while the second uses a rules-based classifier. A case implementation, FreeFood@MIT, was implemented to expose the results of these classification schemes and is used as a benchmark for recommendations. by Mario A. Harik. Thesis (M. Eng.)

ResultsThe reported annual vaccination coverage ranged from 72. 6 % to 100 %. The estimated national annual burden ranged from 0 to 30. 6 DALYs/ 100, 000. Adjusting for year, there was a significant negative relationship between coverage and burden. For a given country there was a decrease in log-transformed DALYs/ 100, 000 of 0. 025 (95 % confidence interval: − 0. 047 to − 0. 003) for every percentage increase in vaccination coverage. The largest effect of calendar time on estimated burden of measles was observed for the year 2011, the smallest was for the year 2007. ConclusionsThis study shows that the degree of success of national measles vaccination programs, when measured by the coverage obtained, is significantly associated with overall impact of measles across EU/EEA MS.

40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) faces a {{challenging}} environmental management effort, including environmental protection, environmental restoration, waste management, and decommissioning. This effort requires extensive {{sampling and analysis}} to determine the type and level of contamination and the appropriate technology for cleanup, and to verify compliance with environmental regulations. Data obtained from these sampling and analysis activities are used to support environmental management decisions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{efficient and}} decentralized monitoring of objects {{moving in a}} transportation network. Previous work in moving object monitoring has focused primarily on <b>centralized</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> like moving object databases and geographic <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> In contrast, in this paper monitoring is in-network, requiring no centralized control and allowing for substantial spatial constraints to the movement of information. The transportation network {{is assumed to be}} augmented with fixed checkpoints that can detect passing mobile objects. This assumption is motivated by many practical applications, from traffic management in vehicle ad hoc networks to habitat monitoring by tracking animal movements. In this context, this paper proposes and evaluates a family of efficient decentralized algorithms for capturing, storing and querying the movements of objects. The algorithms differ in the restrictions they make on the communication and sensing constraints to the mobile nodes and the fixed checkpoints. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated and compared with respect to their scalability (in terms of communication and space complexity), and their latency (the time between when a movement event occurs, and when all interested nodes are updated with records about that event). The conclusions identify three key principles for efficient decentralized monitoring of objects moving past checkpoints: structuring computation around neighboring checkpoints; taking advantage of mobility diffusion and separating the generation and querying of movement informatio...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MMed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. Introduction Lake Mzingazi is {{the only}} {{suitable}} source of domestic water supply for the Richards Bay community. Rapid industrialisation {{in the city of}} uMhlathuze, accompanied by an influx of people, has resulted in informal settlement occurring around the lake. The uncontrolled activities of this development threaten to pollute the water source. Previous studies in 1979 conducted by Council of Scientific & Industrial Research indicated that Lake Mzingazi water was still within acceptable limits in terms of the Department of Water Affairs & Forestry guidelines. The lake water quality was that of a Class I water resource, which is excellent for domestic use. Pollution of the lake can result from diffuse sources of pollution due to settlement of communities around it. Water purification costs could escalate thus forcing an increase in water tariffs. If pollution resulted in the lake being unable to be utilized, the Richards Bay community will be seriously affected, as it would necessitate the importing of water from distant regions. Either way, the expense of acquiring water would increase. All living organisms rely on adequate water for their survival. Worse still are human beings for their water should not only be adequate but should be of good quality to prevent health risks and even death. It is in view of these possibilities that the study was undertaken. Aim The aim of the study is to assess the extent of physical, chemical and biological pollution in Lake Mzingazi due to non-point sources and to recommend necessary protection measures that need to be implemented to prevent any negative health impact on surrounding communities. At present there are no restrictions and no protection of the lake from pollution except that no recreation is allowed into the lake at present. Methods Several objectives were set in order to focus on specific issues. One of the objectives was to inform the communities around the lake about the study. Sampling of the lake water was conducted monthly from June to November 2006 (using a boat). Pictures of areas around the lake were also taken for further analysis. At each sampling run, 36 samples were taken and delivered to a laboratory accredited by the South African National Accreditation Standards for analyses. Six sampling runs were completed. Secondary data for the period of 1998 to 2005 were obtained from uMhlathuze Municipality in order to establish pollution trends and for comparison purposes with the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry guidelines. Results The findings of the study revealed that the quality of the lake water is still within acceptable limits when compared with the Department of Water Affairs & Forestry guidelines; however, informal settlement threatens the future of the lake by encroaching into the lake banks. Discussion There is definitely a risk of pollution to Lake Mzingazi {{as long as there are}} no pollution prevention plans in place.
