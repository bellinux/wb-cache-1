5|$|<b>Cantharidin,</b> the blister-causing oil {{found in}} several {{families}} of beetles {{described by the}} vague common name Spanish fly, was accepted by the FDA in 2004 as treatment for warts and other skin problems. It was in Ancient Greece and Rome, and {{has been used as}} an aphrodisiac in some societies. Studies in cell culture and animal models have demonstrated tumour-fighting properties.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Kendrick Ford {{was convicted}} and given a multiyear prison {{sentence}} in 1954 for the unintended deaths of two women surreptitiously given candies laced with <b>cantharidin,</b> which were intended {{to act as an}} aphrodisiac.|$|E
25|$|Ingested toxins {{are rarely}} {{a cause of}} colic in the horse. Toxins that can produce colic signs include organophosphates, monensin, and <b>cantharidin.</b> Additionally, overuse of certain drugs such as NSAIDs may lead to colic signs (See Gastric {{ulceration}} and Right dorsal colitis).|$|E
25|$|The {{defensive}} chemical <b>cantharidin</b> {{for which}} the beetle is known is produced only by males; females obtain it from males during mating, as the spermatophore contains some. This may be a nuptial gift, increasing the value of mating to the female, and thus increasing the male's reproductive fitness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cantharidin</b> is dangerously toxic, {{inhibiting}} {{the enzyme}} phosphatase 2A. It causes irritation, blistering, bleeding and discomfort. These effects can escalate to erosion and bleeding of mucosa in each system, sometimes followed by severe gastro-intestinal bleeding and acute tubular necrosis and glomerular destruction, resulting in gastro-intestinal and renal dysfunction, by organ failure, and death.|$|E
25|$|Preparations from L. vesicatoria and its {{active agent}} have {{been implicated in}} both {{inadvertent}} and intentional poisonings. Froberg notes a 1954 manslaughter case where <b>cantharidin</b> was administered in a coconut-flavoured candy as an intended aphrodisiac, resulting in illness and eventual death of two women (agent identified postmortem), and in facial blistering and criminal conviction of the perpetrator.|$|E
25|$|Both {{infectious}} and non-infectious {{causes for}} colitis exist. In the adult horse, Salmonella, Clostridium difficile, and Neorickettsia risticii (the causative agent of Potomac Horse Fever) are common causes of colitis. Antibiotics, which {{may lead to}} an altered and unhealthy microbiota, sand, grain overload, and toxins such as arsenic and <b>cantharidin</b> {{can also lead to}} colitis. Unfortunately, only 20–30% of acute colitis cases are able to be definitively diagnosed. NSAIDs can cause slower-onset of colitis, usually in the right dorsal colon (see Right dorsal colitis).|$|E
25|$|The {{active agent}} has been {{estimated}} present at about 0.2-0.7mg per beetle, males producing significantly more than females. The beetle secretes the agent orally, and exudes it from its joints as a milky fluid. The potency of the insect species as a vesicant has been known since antiquity and the activity {{has been used in}} various ways. This has led to its small-scale commercial preparation and sale, in a powdered form known as cantharides (from the plural of Greek κανθαρίς, Kantharis, beetle), obtained from dried and ground beetles. The crushed powder is of yellow-brown to brown-olive color with iridescent reflections, is of disagreeable scent, and is bitter to taste. <b>Cantharidin,</b> the active agent, is a terpenoid, and is produced by some other insects, such as Epicauta immaculata.|$|E
2500|$|Spanish fly is an emerald-green beetle, Lytta vesicatoria, in the {{blister beetle}} family (Meloidae). It {{and other such}} species were used in {{preparations}} offered by traditional apothecaries, {{often referred to as}} Cantharides or Spanish fly. [...] The insect {{is the source of the}} terpenoid <b>cantharidin,</b> a toxic blistering agent once used as an aphrodisiac. The original Spanish fly aphrodisiac extract is forbidden to sell due to its negative side effects and it's replaced by a new version called Spanish fly Pro, which doesn't contain the problematic <b>Cantharidin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{have found}} <b>cantharidin</b> {{to be an}} {{effective}} and safe treatment for removing molluscum contagiosum. [...] This medication is usually well-tolerated though mild side effects such as pain or blistering are common.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cantharidin,</b> the {{principal}} active component in preparations of Spanish fly, was first isolated and named in 1810 by the French chemist Pierre Robiquet, [...] who demonstrated {{that it was}} {{the principal}} agent responsible for the aggressively blistering properties of this insect's egg coating. It was asserted at that time that it was as toxic as the most violent poisons then known, such as strychnine.|$|E
2500|$|Gullan and Cranston [...] have divided {{chemical}} defenses {{into two}} classes. Class I chemicals irritate, injure, poison, or drug individual predators. They {{can be further}} separated into immediate or delayed substances, depending {{on the amount of}} time it takes to feel their effects. Immediate substances are encountered topographically when a predator handles the insect while delayed chemicals, which are generally contained within the insect's tissues, induce vomiting and blistering. Class I chemicals include bufadienolides, <b>cantharidin,</b> cyanides, cardenolides, and alkaloids, all of which have greater effects on vertebrates than on other arthropods. In fact, the most frequently encountered defensive compounds in insects are alkaloids.|$|E
2500|$|Horses form ulcers in {{the stomach}} fairly commonly, a disease called equine gastric ulcer syndrome. [...] Risk factors include confinement, {{infrequent}} feedings, {{a high proportion of}} concentrate feeds, such as grains, excessive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and the stress of shipping and showing. [...] Gastric ulceration has also been associated with the consumption of <b>cantharidin</b> beetles in alfalfa hay which are very caustic when chewed and ingested. [...] Most ulcers are treatable with medications that inhibit the acid producing cells of the stomach. Antacids are less effective in horses than in humans, because horses produce stomach acid almost constantly, while humans produce acid mainly when eating. Dietary management is critical. [...] Bleeding ulcers leading to stomach rupture are rare.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cantharidin</b> {{has been}} used since ancient times as an aphrodisiac, {{possibly}} because its physical effects were perceived to mimic those of sexual arousal, and because it can cause priapism. The extreme toxicity of <b>cantharidin</b> makes any use as an aphrodisiac highly dangerous. [...] As a result, {{it is illegal to}} sell (or use) <b>cantharidin</b> or preparations containing it without a prescription in many countries.|$|E
50|$|Males of Berberomeloe majalis {{have higher}} level of <b>cantharidin</b> per beetle: 64.22±51.28 mg/g (dry weight) and 9.10±12.64 mg/g (d. w.). <b>Cantharidin</b> content in {{haemolymph}} is also higher in males (80.9±106.5 µg/g) than in females (20.0±41.5 µg/g).|$|E
50|$|This bird {{is often}} {{poisonous}} {{due to its}} diet of blister beetles. The poison, <b>cantharidin,</b> is held within the tissue of the fowl resulting in poisoning of those that eat the cooked goose. 10 mg of <b>cantharidin</b> can kill a human.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cantharidin</b> {{appears to}} have some effect in the topical {{treatment}} of cutaneous leishmaniasis in animal models. In addition to topical medical applications, <b>cantharidin</b> and its analogues may have activity against cancer cells.Laboratory studies with cultured tumor cells suggest that this activity {{may be the result}} of PP2A inhibition.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cantharidin</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1810 by Pierre Robiquet, a French chemist then living in Paris, from Lytta vesicatoria. Robiquet demonstrated that <b>cantharidin</b> was the actual principle {{responsible for the}} aggressively blistering {{properties of the coating}} of the eggs of that insect, and established that <b>cantharidin</b> had definite toxic properties comparable in degree to those of the most virulent poisons known in the 19th century, such as strychnine. It is an odorless and colorless solid at room temperature. It is secreted by the male blister beetle and given to the female as a copulatory gift during mating. Afterwards, the female beetle covers her eggs with it as a defense against predators.|$|E
5000|$|The elytra {{of these}} beetles are ground fine and {{occasionally}} {{used as an}} aphrodisiac or poison by the Bantu, the active principle being <b>cantharidin,</b> a terpenoid painfully irritating to mucous membranes {{such as those of}} the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts, and damaging to the kidneys. Most blister beetle species are protected by <b>cantharidin.</b> Spanish Fly or Lytta vesicatoria also belongs to the Meloidae family. The toxic nature of blister beetles was recorded {{as far back as the}} 4th century BC by Hippocrates. In the late 1700s the Marquis de Sade was charged with poisoning of participants in an orgy by the use of <b>cantharidin.</b>|$|E

Symptoms of <b>cantharidin</b> poisoning include blood in the urine, abdominal pain, and rarely prolonged erections.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cantharidin</b> is an odorless, colorless terpenoid {{secreted}} by {{many species}} of blister beetles, including broadly in genus Epicauta, genus Berberomeloe, and in species Lytta vesicatoria (Spanish fly). False blister beetles, cardinal beetles, and soldier beetles also produce <b>cantharidin.</b> Poisoning from the substance is a significant veterinary concern, especially in horses from the Epicauta species, {{but it can also}} be poisonous to humans if taken internally (where the origin is most often experimental self-exposure). Externally, <b>cantharidin</b> is a potent vesicant (blistering agent), exposure to which can cause severe chemical burns. Properly dosed and applied, the same properties have been used for effective topical medications for some conditions, such as treating patients with molluscum contagiosum infection of the skin.|$|E

5000|$|Worse {{than its}} damage to plants is its toxicity. Like other blister beetles, it {{contains}} <b>cantharidin,</b> a toxic terpenoid. This compound is a vesicant {{that causes the}} blistering of skin and mucous membranes. It is injurious to livestock that consume beetles living in hay, and {{has been known to}} cause fatalities, particularly of horses. <b>Cantharidin</b> toxicity in an animal may be called cantharidiasis. [...] The <b>cantharidin</b> content of one striped blister beetle has been reported to be about 0.31 to 1.45 milligrams in one small sample, and about 4 or 5 milligrams in general. The toxic dose of <b>cantharidin</b> in horses is about one milligram per kilogram body weight, and the ingestion of 30 to 50 beetles can be fatal. Even two to five beetles can cause horse colic, and hay containing the remnants or fluids of crushed beetles can cause symptoms when eaten. Signs of toxicity include blisters and ulcers of the mouth, pawing, stretching, diarrhea containing bits of intestinal mucosa, hypocalcaemia, and hypomagnesemia. Cattle and sheep appear to be less susceptible but can suffer some symptoms from beetle ingestion.|$|E

50|$|Merlsheimer showed {{particular}} interest in 25 gm of the nerve agent <b>cantharidin</b> that Kaiser had acquired. Although the Resistance Department of the KgU had issued doses of the poison to some of their contacts in East Germany, {{there was no evidence}} that any had been used, which meant that this line of attack could be presented to the court only in terms of what might theoretically be possible. Melsheimer explained, however, that under a best case scenario, administering doses intravenously ("bestmöglicher intravenöser Anwendung"), 25,000 people could be killed with Kaiser's <b>cantharidin.</b>|$|E
