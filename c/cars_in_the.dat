5|$|According to the U.S. Department of Energy, {{combined}} sales of plug-in hybrids and battery electric <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American market climbed more rapidly and outsold {{by more than}} double sales of hybrid-electric vehicles over their respective 24 month introductory periods. A 2016 analysis by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) found that 5 years after its introduction, sales of plug-in electric <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. continued to outsell conventional hybrids. An analysis by Scientific American found a similar trend {{at the international level}} when considering the global top selling PEVs over a 36-month introductory period. Monthly sales of the Volt, Prius PHV and Leaf performed better than the conventional Prius during their respective introductory periods, {{with the exception of the}} Mitsubishi i-MiEV, which has been outsold most of the time by the Prius HEV over their 36-month introductory periods.|$|E

5|$|At the school, the {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} {{the collapse of a}} concrete block wall. One hallway completely collapsed, trapping many students in the rubble of the hallway known as 3rd Hall. The tornado at the school was so strong that it tossed and mangled <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005, {{construction}} commenced {{on the new}} South Ferry–Whitehall Street {{station on}} the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, which is located underneath an older loop-platformed station {{of the same name}} in South Ferry, Manhattan. It is designed as an ADA-accessible, two-track terminal, which allows all ten cars of the train to platform and all doors to be opened, as opposed to only the first five <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old station.|$|E
5|$|Richmond {{returned}} to racing sprint <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States Automobile Club's (USAC) national sprint car tour in 1978. Competing in 12 races, he finished 30th in points as the series' Rookie of the Year. That year he attended Jim Russell's road racing school at Willow Springs International Motorsports Park, setting a student course record. Richmond raced in a 1978 Mini Indy car event at Phoenix International Raceway, winning the Formula Super Vee support event in a Lola T620. The win attracted sponsors and attention from major owners like Roger Penske. He also competed in USAC's Silver Crown series.|$|E

5|$|The Rockingham 500 was {{an annual}} Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) motor race {{held at the}} Rockingham Motor Speedway oval track in Corby, Northamptonshire, England, United Kingdom in 2001 and 2002. The event {{was the first major}} motor race held on an oval track {{featuring}} Champ <b>Cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom. It was created in the hope of rivalling the Formula One British Grand Prix, although CART had problems promoting the event to the public.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan of Oman ordered six Mercedes 450 limousines in 1977, {{but quickly}} {{discovered}} {{that they were not}} as safe as he had been led to believe. His ex-SAS bodyguards tested one of the <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert in July 1977, by firing at it, but a bullet hit an emergency air cylinder, which led to the petrol tank blowing up, burning the whole car. The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent.|$|E
5|$|The gorge is {{susceptible}} to flooding.

5|$|The next rung on {{the racing}} ladder on the East Coast of the United States was to race in sprint <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Racing Club (URC). Andretti {{was able to}} get a ride for {{individual}} races in the URC sprint car racing series, but was unable to secure a full-time ride. He once drove from Canada to Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania hoping to find a ride in an event, but he went empty-handed. He bypassed the series when he was offered a full-time ride in a United States Automobile Club sprint car for 1964.|$|E
5|$|The third {{practice}} on Saturday morning was interrupted {{midway through the}} session when Kimi Räikkönen crashed his Ferrari at Sainte Dévote. His team mate Sebastian Vettel set the fastest lap during the session, ahead of the Mercedes' of Rosberg and Hamilton. Hamilton reported problems with his car, believed by his race engineer {{to be caused by}} over-pressured tyres. The two Renault-powered teams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso, confirmed their strong pace by placing all four <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top ten.|$|E
5|$|Writing in {{the book}} The Films of Luc Besson, Susan Hayward, {{director}} of Film Studies at the University of Exeter, considered Le Dernier Combat and The Fifth Element to be Besson's two film's which focus {{on the theme of}} environmental damage, as waste and pollution are visible throughout both films. Capitalism was also considered to be a theme; consumer commodities were said to be signs of death, such as the abandoned <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert and the floating washing machines in a flooded abandoned factory.|$|E

5|$|By 1880 {{the railway}} had six {{locomotives}} at its disposal. No. 1–2 were Class 14 that were intended as helping {{power to get}} trains up the steep climb from Gudå to Storlien. No. 3–6 were Class 9 locomotives that would do the main haulage from Gudå into Trondheim. In 1883, NSB's other two Class 14 locomotives were transferred from the Smaalenene Line. The initial fleet consisted of 24 passenger and nine breaking cars, all from Skabo. The line featured the first bogie <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, with a single entrance {{at the end of}} each car, instead of individual doors for each compartment. There were also 37 closed freight cars, 40 lumber cars, 20 boxcars, 100 flatcars and three milk cars. At first all trains were mixed freight and passenger.|$|E
5|$|During World War I {{the track}} and rolling stock {{received}} little maintenance, {{and by the end}} of the war they were in a piteous state, while expenses had increased dramatically. The problem became a crisis after the serious fire at the Trianon depot on 30 November 1921, which destroyed 70 of the 155 trams of the CTR. Successive fare rises provided a stopgap, but with the new convention of 29 December 1923 the company announced a reorganisation of the network. A competitor had also arrived: the bus. Trams had always attracted criticism over their limited capacity, slowness and discomfort, and their encumbrance to motor <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city centre. Another accident on the Monumental line on 5 October 1925 hastened the inevitable: the trams lost their first route.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} avoid its {{dependence}} on rare-earth minerals, Toyota Motor Corporation announced in January 2011 that it is developing an alternative motor for future hybrid and electric cars that does not need rare-earth materials. Toyota engineers in Japan and the U.S. are developing an induction motor that is lighter and more efficient than the magnet-type motor used in the Prius, which uses two rare earths in its motor magnets. Other popular hybrids and plug-in electric <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market that use these rare-earth elements are the Nissan Leaf, the Chevrolet Volt and Honda Insight. For its second generation RAV4 EV due in 2012, Toyota is using an induction motor supplied by Tesla Motors that does not require rare-earth materials. The Tesla Roadster and the Tesla Model S use a similar motor.|$|E

5|$|March {{was more}} {{successful}} in selling large numbers of customer <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower formulae. Mosley organised extensive test sessions for the 1971 cars for journalists and drivers, and arranged a successful scheme for drivers to rent cars and engines for the season, rather than buying them outright. Losing money on a deal to supply Jochen Neerpasch, then motorsport manager at Ford, with a Formula Two car paid off when Neerpasch moved to BMW and offered March an exclusive deal to use BMW's Formula Two engine for the 1973 season. March cars powered by BMW engines won five of the next 11 European Formula Two championships. However, BMW also put pressure on Herd {{to concentrate on the}} Formula Two programme. As a result, he spent less time with the Formula One team, where Mosley started to act as a race engineer.|$|E
5|$|McMurray and Montoya {{continued}} to lead {{for the next}} three laps, as 14 teams were repairing their <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garage after the lap 29 crash. On lap39, Keselowski retook the lead, after having assistance from Regan Smith. Three laps later, Johnson was preparing to return to the race. On lap43, Stewart took the lead one lap before Keselowski retook it from him. On lap 45th, Bowyer became the quickest in the race with a speed of over 200mph. Two laps later, Robert Richardson, Jr. spun off the bumper of Travis Kvapil, bringing out yet the fifth caution. He sustained major damage to his car in the accident. Under caution, the leaders made pit stops, giving the first and second positions to Terry Labonte and Dave Blaney at the restart. On lap51, Kurt Busch led before Menard overtook him.|$|E
5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E
