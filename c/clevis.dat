25|$|Roberts backed {{a pickup}} truck {{up to the front}} of the Amish schoolhouse and entered the school at {{approximately}} 10:25a.m. EDT, shortly after the children had returned from recess. He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing <b>clevis</b> pin on the road. Survivors said that Roberts was mumbling his words and was not making direct eye contact. After the occupants of the classroom denied seeing a <b>clevis</b> pin, Roberts walked out to his truck and reappeared in the classroom holding a Springfield XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom from the back of his pickup. Zook and her mother, who was visiting the schoolhouse, took this opportunity to escape the school and ran toward a nearby farm to get help. Roberts saw them leave, and ordered one of the boys to stop them, threatening to shoot everyone if the women got away.|$|E
25|$|The {{second type}} of bolted joint {{transfers}} the applied load in shear of the bolt shank and relies on the shear strength of the bolt. Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental. A preload is still applied but consideration of joint flexibility is not as critical {{as in the case}} where loads are transmitted through the joint in tension. Other such shear joints do not employ a preload on the bolt as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about the bolt, but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include <b>clevis</b> linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like lock washers, thread adhesives, and lock nuts).|$|E
2500|$|Multitool knives {{often have}} more than one blade, {{including}} an assortment of knife blade edges (serrated, plain, saws) as well as a myriad of other tools such as bottle openers, corkscrews, and scissors. A large tool selection is the signature of the Swiss Army Knife. These knives are produced by Victorinox and Wenger and issued to military services and sold to the public. [...] Similar to the Swiss Army knife is the German Army knife, with two blades opening from each side and featuring hard plastic grips and aluminum liners. [...] The U.S. Military utility knife (MIL-K-818), issued by the United States Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, was made for many years by the Camillus Cutlery Company and Imperial Schrade as well as many other companies. [...] It was originally produced with carbon steel blades and brass liners (both vulnerable to corrosion), but with the onset of the Vietnam War was modified to incorporate all-stainless steel construction. [...] The current-issue U.S. military utility knife has textured stainless grips and four stainless blades/tools opening on both sides in the camper or scout pattern and has an extremely large <b>clevis</b> or bail.|$|E
60|$|When the {{visitors}} rose to go, Harding appeared. He had come, he explained, for an ox-chain <b>clevis.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "If you can't find hook or <b>clevis,</b> cut the trace," [...] he said. [...] "It can't {{burn the}} plough, and the devils {{are out of}} hand now. The fire will jump these furrows, and we've got to try again." ...|$|E
60|$|Devine drove a birch log {{behind the}} wheels {{and then ran}} to the leaders' heads and cracked his whip, while Harding called to the pole-team. For a few moments the {{battering}} hoofs churned up the sloppy trail and the wagon groaned and shook, the horses floundering and slipping without moving it. Then with a harsh creak the high wheels began to turn and they slowly struggled up the hill. Harness rattled, chain and <b>clevis</b> rang, the steam from the toiling animals rose in a thin cloud, and white smears streaked their coats as they strained at the collar. The men were red in face and panting hard, but as they fought the grade they broke into breathless shouts. Harding was sparing of the whip; {{but this was not}} a time to be weakly merciful, when the load might overpower his teams and, running back, drag them over the edge. Nor dare he stop again and subject the animals to the cruel effort of restarting. They must get up somehow before their strength gave out.|$|E
60|$|MY FRIEND: By the way, a {{fine example}} was {{presented}} on board the boat for contemplating the effect of condition upon human happiness. A gentleman had purchased twelve negroes {{in different parts of}} Kentucky, and was taking them to a farm in the South. They were chained six and six together. A small iron <b>clevis</b> was around the left wrist of each, and this fastened to the main chain by a shorter one, at a convenient distance from the others, so that the negroes were strung together precisely like so many fish upon a trotline. In this condition they were being separated forever from the scenes of their childhood, their friends, their fathers and mothers, and brothers and sisters, and many of them from their wives and children, and going into perpetual slavery where the lash of the master is proverbially more ruthless and unrelenting than any other; and yet amid all these distressing circumstances, as we would think them, they were the most cheerful and apparently happy creatures on board. One, whose offence for which he had been sold was an overfondness for his wife, played the fiddle almost continually, and the others danced, sang, cracked jokes, and played various games with cards from day to day. How true it is that 'God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,' or in other words, that he renders the worst of human conditions tolerable, while he permits the best to be nothing better than tolerable. To return to the narrative: When we reached Springfield I stayed but one day, when I started on this tedious circuit where I now am. Do you remember my going to the city, while I was in Kentucky, to have a tooth extracted, and making a failure of it? Well, that same old tooth got to paining me so much that about a week since I had it torn out, bringing with it a bit of the jawbone, the consequence of which is that my mouth is now so sore that I can neither talk nor eat.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>clevis</b> {{fastener}} is a three-piece fastener system {{consisting of}} a <b>clevis,</b> <b>clevis</b> pin, and tang. The <b>clevis</b> is a U-shaped piece that has holes {{at the end of}} the prongs to accept the <b>clevis</b> pin. The <b>clevis</b> pin is similar to a bolt, but is only partially threaded or unthreaded with a cross-hole for a split pin. The tang is a piece that fits in the space within the <b>clevis</b> and is held in place by the <b>clevis</b> pin. [...] The combination of a simple <b>clevis</b> fitted with a pin is commonly called a shackle, although a <b>clevis</b> and pin is only one of the many forms a shackle may take.|$|E
50|$|A <b>clevis</b> hanger {{consists}} of one U-shaped <b>clevis</b> {{and a second}} V-shaped <b>clevis</b> {{with a hole in}} a flattened section {{at the base of the}} V, joined together with a bolt or pin. <b>Clevis</b> hangers are used as a pipe attachment providing vertical adjustment for pipes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clevis</b> pins {{should be}} closely fitted to {{the holes in}} the <b>clevis</b> to limit wear and reduce the failure rate of either the pin or the <b>clevis.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>clevis</b> hook is a hook, with {{or without}} a snap lock, with a <b>clevis</b> and bolt or pin at the base. The <b>clevis</b> is used to fasten the hook to a bracket or chain.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A <b>clevis</b> and <b>clevis</b> pin, held {{in place}} by a split pin ...|$|E
5000|$|A bolt can {{function}} as a <b>clevis</b> pin, but a bolt {{is not intended to}} take the lateral stress that a <b>clevis</b> pin must handle. Normal bolts are manufactured to handle tension loads, whereas <b>clevis</b> pins and bolts are designed to withstand shearing forces.|$|E
50|$|A <b>clevis</b> bracket {{generally}} {{takes the}} form of a solid metal piece with a flat rectangular base, fitted with holes for bolts or machine screws, and two rounded wings in parallel forming a <b>clevis.</b> Commonly used in aircraft and cars, <b>clevis</b> brackets allow mounting of rods to flat surfaces.|$|E
50|$|As with swage {{terminals}}, swageless terminals {{are available}} {{with a variety of}} different attachment methods; fixed <b>clevis</b> forks, toggling <b>clevis</b> forks, eyes and threaded studs (for insertion in a turnbuckle barrel).|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>clevis</b> pins: {{threaded}} and unthreaded. Unthreaded <b>clevis</b> pins have a domed head {{at one end and}} a cross-hole at the other end. A cotter pin (USA usage) or split pin is used to keep the <b>clevis</b> pin in place. Threaded <b>clevis</b> pins have a partially threaded shank on one end and a formed head on the other. The formed head has a lip, which acts as a stop when threading the pin into the shackle, and a flattened tab with a cross-hole. The flattened tab allows for easy installation of the pin and the cross-hole allows the pin to be moused.|$|E
50|$|A <b>clevis</b> rod end is {{a folded}} or {{machined}} piece formed into a <b>clevis</b> and {{fitted with a}} hole at its base to which a rod is attached. In machined pieces, the hole is most often threaded.|$|E
5000|$|Bridge pin (fasteners), {{a device}} for fixing <b>clevis</b> or hitch pins.|$|E
50|$|The {{boosters}} {{were composed}} of seven individually manufactured steel segments. These were assembled in pairs by the manufacturer, and then shipped to Kennedy Space Center by rail for final assembly. The segments were fixed together using circumferential tang, <b>clevis,</b> and <b>clevis</b> pin fastening, and sealed with three O-rings (two {{prior to the}} Challenger Disaster in 1986) and heat-resistant putty.|$|E
50|$|Describing an orgy scene, {{the author}} targets the progressivism of the <b>Clevis</b> family.|$|E
50|$|Two {{distinct}} chains can {{be connected}} using a quick link, carabiner, or <b>clevis.</b>|$|E
50|$|A twin <b>clevis</b> {{is a solid}} {{piece with}} two {{clevises}} directly opposite one another, each fitted with a pin. Twin clevises are commonly used to join two lengths of chain.|$|E
50|$|More {{sophisticated}} cylinders have a {{body with}} end cover, a piston rod, and a cylinder head. At one side the bottom is, for instance, connected to a single <b>clevis,</b> whereas at the other side, the piston rod is also foreseen with a single <b>clevis.</b> The cylinder shell normally has hydraulic connections at both sides; that is, a connection at the bottom side and a connection at the cylinder head side. If oil is pushed under the piston, the piston rod is pushed out and oil that was between the piston and the cylinder head is pushed back to the oil tank.|$|E
50|$|It {{is local}} {{tradition}} that the parish stone pit at Croft, {{known as the}} <b>Clevis,</b> was originally a first-century Roman granite quarry used {{in the construction of}} the foundations and bridges of the Fosse Way.|$|E
5000|$|Split pins are {{frequently}} used to secure other fasteners, e.g. <b>clevis</b> pins, {{as well as}} being used in combination with hardboard discs as a traditional joining technique for teddy bears. A common application of this is when used to secure a castellated nut.|$|E
5000|$|In 1938, the Rev. Canon James of Newton {{invited the}} Sisters of St Clare from Newry, County Down, Northern Ireland {{to open a}} {{secondary}} day-school for girls in their new convent at The <b>Clevis</b> in Newton. The school was originally titled Sacred Heart School.|$|E
5000|$|Rigging {{comes from}} rig, {{to set up}} or prepare. Rigging is the {{equipment}} such as wire rope, turnbuckles, <b>clevis,</b> jacks used with cranes and other lifting equipment in material handling and structure relocation. Rigging systems commonly include shackles, master links and slings. Also, lifting bags in under water lifting.|$|E
50|$|Mousing (pronounced mouzing) is the {{application}} of a molly or safety wire, called mousing wire in this use, to secure a threaded <b>clevis</b> pin to a shackle. This is done by passing a couple of turns of mousing wire through the reach-hole provided for this purpose in the unthreaded end of the <b>clevis</b> pin and around the body of the shackle's hoop. Alternatively, some threaded shackles are provided with a hole through the threaded end of the pin beyond where it emerges from the threaded hole. A cotter pin or a couple of loops of mousing wire through this hole serves the same purpose and secures the shackle in a closed position. Nylon zip ties are also commonly used in applications where the shackle must be secured, but easy removal is required.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{the priest}} has full vestments (chasuble, dalmatic, <b>clevis,</b> veil {{covering}} the chalice, purse, stole, maniple), satin brocaded, with colourful ornaments, {{and with an}} undecorated cross of a landscape, from the 18th century. This is a unique set for the Department, and is also classified as an historic monument object.|$|E
5000|$|Symbolism: The {{diagonal}} {{separation of}} colors denotes a line not crossed. The <b>clevis</b> (key) symbolizes the unit's long history and knowledge {{as being a}} key to winning the battle. The crossed rifle and saber allude to the Brigade's mission during World War II as the 91st Reconnaissance Cavalry Company. The motto translates to [...] "To Win War and Peace." ...|$|E

50|$|Clevises {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{fasteners}} used in farming equipment and sailboat rigging, as well as the automotive, aircraft and construction industries. They are also widely used to attach control surfaces and other accessories to servo controls in airworthy model aircraft. As a part of a fastener, a <b>clevis</b> provides a method of allowing rotation in some axes while restricting rotation in others.|$|E
50|$|Pivot mounts —Absorb {{force on}} the {{cylinder}} centerline and let the cylinder change alignment in one plane. Common types include clevises, trunnion mounts and spherical bearings. Because these mounts allow a cylinder to pivot, they should be used with rod-end attachments that also pivot. <b>Clevis</b> mounts {{can be used in}} any orientation and are generally recommended for short strokes and small- to medium-bore cylinders.|$|E
50|$|The main {{function}} of the cap is to enclose the pressure chamber at one end. The cap {{is connected to the}} body by means of welding, threading, bolts, or tie rod. Caps also perform as cylinder mounting components flange, cap trunnion, cap <b>clevis.</b> Cap size is determined based on the bending stress. A static seal / o-ring is used in between cap and barrel (except welded construction).|$|E
50|$|It is {{a dynamic}} {{component}} i.e. is designed to withstand both tensile and compression load. strut can be provide in vertical as well as horizontal direction. V-type Strut {{can be used to}} restrict 2 degrees of freedom. It consists of stiff clamp, rigid strut, welding <b>clevis.</b> Selection depends on pipe size, load, temperature, insulation, assembly length. As it comes with hinge and clamp, no substantial frictional force comes into play.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to this need, Sister Rosemarie assembled {{a group of people}} to work with her on this project. They became the first board of directors: Bonnie Goodman, Cathy Truesdale, Jim Truesdale, <b>Clevis</b> Cabrera, Joyce Shannon, Nick Hindman, Paul Wood, Barb Williams and Willie Williams. Sister Rosemarie also met with many local leaders, Leah Krantz, from The Greater Chicago Food Depository [...] and Bernie Kleina, the Executive Director of the Hope Fair Housing Center.|$|E
