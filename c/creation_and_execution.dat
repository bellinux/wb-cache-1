500|$|From {{conception}} {{to final}} release in 2009, drummer Aaron Harris {{estimates that the}} <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> of Wavering Radiant took {{about two and a}} half years. During the writing of the record, all of Isis' members were residing permanently within Los Angeles; a situation in contrast to their previous full-length, 2006's In the Absence of Truth; band members were divided between New York and Los Angeles throughout that album's inception and creation. The entire band felt a degree of dissatisfaction with In the Absence of Truth, and Harris felt that the logistical change was beneficial to the writing process, allowing for more time: [...] "rather than feeling like we had limited time to capture something, I felt like we could take our time with the songs, and come back the next day to work on things rather than in a few weeks". The resulting sound was described by guitarist Michael Gallagher as [...] "more live [...] a little bit dirtier – almost, for lack of a better word, sloppy. But in a good way. We spent a lot of time getting all of our takes as close to perfect as we could on previous records. On this one, we went more with the vibe of the particular take in question." ...|$|E

40|$|Research in {{ubiquitous}} computing showed the possibilities and advantages of deploying personalized and adaptive services in distributed environments. However traditional service creation burdens the users with proprietary device descriptions and service programming skills. New design paradigms, such as general frameworks {{based on an}} open cooperating objects standard enable seamless environments for <b>creation,</b> deployment, <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> of services. This open, distributed, and scalable platform supports the realization of evolvable services based on arbitrary combinations of cooperative objects. This paper introduces a system, which allows the adaptable <b>creation,</b> deployment, <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> of rule-based service descriptions. Thereby, services are customizable by the user and automatically adapted to changing environments...|$|R

50|$|SDPs {{often require}} {{integration}} of IT capabilities <b>and</b> the <b>creation</b> {{of services that}} cross technology and network boundaries. SDPs available today tend to be optimized for the delivery of a service in a given technological or network domain (e.g. in telecommunications this includes: web, IMS, IPTV, Mobile TV, etc.). They typically provide environments for service control, <b>creation,</b> <b>and</b> orchestration <b>and</b> <b>execution.</b> Again in telecommunications, this can include abstractions for media control, presence/location, integration, and other low-level communications capabilities. SDPs are applicable to both consumer and business applications.|$|R

30|$|Service {{composition}} {{may happen}} offline or online, i.e., at creation or execution time. However, {{this very important}} difference is not always made clear in proposals. Agarwal et al. [10] present some approaches {{for dealing with the}} multifaceted problem of web service composition <b>and</b> <b>execution,</b> defining it as the process of creating workflows which realize the functionality of a new service and their subsequent deployment <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> in a runtime environment. Our work acknowledges the difference between service <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> service <b>execution,</b> <b>and</b> the approaches for semi-automated service creation presented here are mostly targeted to work offline, even though the actual subservices to be executed are only selected at execution time due to the late binding feature.|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{research}} is to find a continuous solution, which allows the description, the <b>creation,</b> the provisioning, <b>and</b> the <b>execution</b> of value-added telecommunication services. This work proposes a framework for an easy <b>and</b> timesaving <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> provisioning of value-added telecommunication services in Next Generation Networks. As research method, feasibility, comparative methods are used in this study. Criteria and requirements for service description, service <b>creation,</b> service <b>execution,</b> <b>and</b> service provisioning, are defined and existing technologies are compared with each other and evaluated regarding these criteria and requirements. Extensions to the selected technologies are proposed and possibilities to combine these technologies are researched. From the results of the previous steps, a framework is defined which offers a continuous solution for the description, <b>creation,</b> provisioning <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> of value-added services. In order to test the proof of concept, this framework is prototypically implemented. For a qualitative analysis of the research targets and the proof of concept, an example service is created and executed within the framework prototype. Furthermore, in order to examine the validity of the quantitative aims and objectives of this research work, a second example service is created, and its characteristics are measured and analysed. The result {{of this research is}} a novel continuous approach for the creation of value-added telecommunication services. This research introduces new possibilities for the service description, service <b>creation,</b> service provisioning, <b>and</b> service <b>execution</b> through an extension of the common telecommunication real-time execution environment JAIN SLEE. Value-added services are described by using the business process execution language BPEL. This language facilitates a simple and fast service design. The service can automatically be composed from pre-defined and pre-deployed components...|$|R
