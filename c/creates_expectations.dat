The embodied nature of virtual agents lead to specific syntactic constructs that are not unlike sublanguages: these can be used to specify the parsing component of a natural language interface. However, the most specific aspects of interacting with virtual actors consist in mapping the semantic content of users’ input to the mechanisms that support agents’ behaviours. We suggest that a generalisation of speech acts can provide principles for this integration. Both aspects are illustrated by results obtained during the development of research prototypes. ...|$|E

Accordingly, reading should be disrupted when a protagonist avoids an action with desirable consequences, but reading should not be disrupted when a protagonist takes an action with undesirable consequences.

40|$|This thesis adapts the ITPRA theory by David Huron to dance. The ImaginationTensionPredictionReactionAppraisal {{theory is}} {{designed}} to analyse listeners' emotional and physical responses to musical events, based on memory and exposure. According {{to a number of}} musical conventions, listeners <b>create</b> <b>expectations</b> about succeeding musical events. This thesis presents a number of conventions in dance through which spectators <b>create</b> <b>expectations</b> about succeeding choreographic events. Such conventions are natural laws of the body, time, space and genre. Moreover, this thesis explores ways in which musical expectations influence choreographic expectations. For example, expectations regarding melody and rhythm in music interact with expectations about direction and rhythm in dance. Although a number of researchers, such as Ivar Hagendoorn and Corinne Jola, start using neuropsychological or neurocognitive experiments in order to investigate spectators' emotional and physical responses to dance or dance in combination with music, there is still a lack of statistical information regarding these expectations. This thesis presents a number of experimental methods to gather this kind of statistical information...|$|R
40|$|A {{customary}} {{contract is}} a set of terms that is standard in a given locale for a given economic purpose. Once established, such a standard tends to perpetuate itself because it <b>creates</b> <b>expectations</b> about what is fair and appropriate in a given type of economic bargain. We propose a dynamic model of how contractual customs form endogenously. Agents are situated in a geographical or social space, and they recontract periodically based on expected returns, local properties of the contract, and its conformity with local practice. The model predicts that the most likely geographic pattern consists of "patches" where contractual terms are nearly uniform, separated by bounderies where contractual norms jump from one set of terms to another. Differences in regional customs are roughly related to average differences in economic fundamentals, but they mask the considerable amount of heterogeneity that exists within regions. We compare these predictions with contractual practice in contemporary Illionois agriculture, and find considerable support for the model's prediction...|$|E
40|$|Can ideology, as a {{widespread}} "expectation creator," impact economic decisions? In two studies we investigated {{the influence of}} the Benevolent Sexism (BS) ideology (which dictates that men should provide for passive and nurtured women) on women's economic decision-making. In Study 1, using a Dictator Game in which women decided how to share amounts of money with men, results of a Generalized Linear Mixed Model analysis show that higher endorsement of BS and contextual expectations of benevolence were associated with more very unequal offers. Similarly, in an Ultimatum Game in which women received monetary offers from men, Study 2 's Generalized Linear Mixed Model's results revealed that BS led women to reject more very unequal offers. If women's endorsement of BS ideology and expectations of benevolence prove contrary to reality, they may strike back at men. These findings show that BS ideology <b>creates</b> <b>expectations</b> that shape male-female relationships in a way that could be prejudicial to men...|$|E
40|$|We model {{how people}} {{formulate}} and evaluate goals to overcome self-control problems. People often attempt to regulate their behavior by evaluating goal-related outcomes separately (in narrow psychological accounts) rather than jointly (in a broad account). To explain this evidence, our theory of endogenous narrow or broad psychological accounts combines insights from the literatures on goals and mental accounting with models of expectations-based reference-dependent preferences. By formulating goals the individual <b>creates</b> <b>expectations</b> that induce reference points for task outcomes. These goal-induced reference points make substandard performance psychologically painful and motivate {{the individual to}} stick to his goals. How strong the commitment to goals is depends {{on the type of}} psychological account. We provide conditions when it is optimal to evaluate goals in narrow accounts. The key intuition is that broad accounts make decisions or risks in different tasks substitutes and thereby create incentives to deviate from goals. Model extensions explore the robustness of our results to different timing assumptions and goal and account revision. quasi-hyperbolic discounting, reference-dependent preferences, loss aversion, self-control, mental accounting, goals...|$|E

40|$|It is {{an unfortunate}} but {{unavoidable}} feature of even well-ordered democratic societies that governmental administrative agencies often <b>create</b> legitimate <b>expectations</b> (procedural or substantive) {{on the part}} of non-governmental agents (individual citizens, groups, businesses, organizations, institutions, and instrumentalities) but find themselves unable to fulfil those expectations for reasons of justice, the public interest, severe financial constraints, and sometimes harsh political realities. How governmental administrative agencies, operating on behalf of society, handle the creation and frustration of legitimate expectations implicates a whole host of values that we have reason to care about, including under non-ideal conditions-not least justice, fairness, autonomy, the rule of law, responsible uses of power, credible commitments, reliance interests, security of expectations, stability, democracy, parliamentary supremacy, and legitimate authority. This book develops a new theory of legitimate expectations for public administration drawing on normative arguments from political and legal theory. Brown begins by offering a new account of the legitimacy of legitimate expectations. He argues that it is the very responsibility of governmental administrative agencies for <b>creating</b> <b>expectations</b> that ought to ground legitimacy, as opposed to the justice or the legitimate authority of those agencies and expectations. He also clarifies some of the main ways in which agencies can be responsible for <b>creating</b> <b>expectations.</b> Moreover, he argues that governmental administrative agencies should be held liable for losses they directly cause by creating and then frustrating legitimate expectations {{on the part of}} non-governmental agents and, if liable, have an obligation to make adequate compensation payments in respect of those losses...|$|R

40|$|When a {{child is}} hospitalized, it is usually {{more than one person}} who needs {{attention}} – i. e. the child as well as its parents. The emergency ward environment and surgery rooms are unfamiliar and the parents feel anxious, insecure and uncertain about how to act.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate parents' experiences related to this situation. Data was collected by interviewing thirteen consecutively sampled parents. Qualitative content analysis showed that parents' previous experiences created expectations, which in turn influenced their perceptions of the present episode. Participation was perceived as an offer and/or a requirement from parents as well as from the staff. For parents, it sometimes meant an additional effort since it demanded their involvement in caring for the child/in the child’s care. They experienced that their presence could be a threat as well as an asset for the hospital staff. The parents described that the level of accessibility, participation, relief, shared responsibility and adequate information determined the level of perceived security and safety toward medicine and hospital staff. Since every caring experience <b>creates</b> <b>expectations,</b> it means that every caring contact could be seen as an investment in future security...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{argue that the}} way in which craft beer has {{positioned}} itself within the beer industry largely parallels the principles that Annalee Saxenian attributes to Silicon Valley’s success. Craft breweries style themselves as a collaborative group that is fundamentally different than their macrobrewery counterparts. Craft beer is often associated with the collaboration that happens between breweries as they function via a “we all float together” mentality. It is this set up of craft beer as a uniting brand that has allowed for the smaller breweries to be successful. This relationship is what is portrayed to the consumer, but it is more complex than that. Not everyone in the industry is friends and there is still the element of competition present, just as it is in Silicon Valley. I argue that craft beer can also attribute aspects of its success in carving out a space in the beer market – one that is actually viewed as threatening to macrobeer – by establishing itself as a meta-organization. By focusing on community and collaboration, craft beer allows for its consumers to participate in “performative branding. ” The target audience is able to create their identity with the product, which in turn creates this image of craft beer that then is reaffirmed by the individual breweries through the organizational field. The unifying label of craft beer helps to draw in consumers and establish industry practices, but it also <b>creates</b> <b>expectations</b> of difference that individual craft brews and the meta-organization do not always live up to...|$|E
