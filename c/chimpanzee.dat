40|$|Abstract. In their {{treatment}} of juveniles, <b>chimpanzees</b> show exceptional tolerance towards the behaviours of juvenile <b>chimpanzees</b> {{and go to}} great lengths to care for juvenile <b>chimpanzees.</b> This report will examine the behaviours shown by adult <b>chimpanzees</b> towards juvenile <b>chimpanzees</b> to see whether this behaviour indicates that <b>chimpanzees</b> have moral agency. The question of the report is “Does the treatment of juvenile <b>chimpanzees</b> indicate that <b>chimpanzees</b> have moral agency, understood as the ability to act in a virtuous manner, the possession of intellectual skills that allow an understanding of moral rules and the ability to accept responsibility for one’s actions and to hold others accountable for their actions?” The report will attempt to defend an affirmative answer to this question...|$|R
5|$|Hagenbeck's modern zoo {{techniques}} proved effective, and Edinburgh quickly {{gained a}} reputation for its good animal conditions. 1934 saw the births in captivity of a sea lion and beaver, and in 1936 a baby <b>chimpanzee</b> followed. A litter of wolves was born in 1938, and soon afterwards the first orangutan to be born in Britain.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{orangutan}} symbolic capability was conducted from 1973 to 1975 by zoologist Gary L. Shapiro with Aazk, a juvenile female orangutan at the Fresno City Zoo (now Chaffee Zoo) in Fresno, California. The study employed {{the techniques of}} psychologist David Premack, who used plastic tokens to teach linguistic skills to the <b>chimpanzee,</b> Sarah. Shapiro continued to examine the linguistic and learning abilities of ex-captive orangutans in Tanjung Puting National Park, in Indonesian Borneo, between 1978 and 1980.|$|E
5|$|Again {{assisted}} by convict laborers and two army sergeants, Dubois began searching along the Solo River near Trinil in August 1891. His team soon excavated a molar (Trinil 1) and a skullcap (Trinil 2). Its characteristics were a long cranium with a sagittal keel and heavy browridge. Dubois first {{gave them the}} name Anthropopithecus ("man-ape"), as the <b>chimpanzee</b> was sometimes known at the time. He chose this name because a similar tooth found in the Siwalik Hills in India in 1878 had been named Anthropopithecus, and because Dubois first assessed the cranium to have been about , closer to apes than to humans.|$|E

40|$|The {{long-term}} effects of early adverse experiences on later psychosocial functioning are well described in humans, but sparsely documented for <b>chimpanzees.</b> In our earlier studies, we investigated the effects of maternal and social deprivation on three groups of ex-laboratory <b>chimpanzees</b> who experienced either an early or later onset of long-term deprivation. Here we expand our research by adding data on subjects that came from two stable zoo groups. The groups comprised of early maternally deprived wild-caught <b>chimpanzees</b> and non-deprived zoo-born <b>chimpanzees.</b> We found that compared to zoo <b>chimpanzees,</b> ex-laboratory <b>chimpanzees</b> were more restricted regarding their association partners in the newly formed groups, but not during their second year of group-life, indicating that social stability has an important influence on the toleration of association partners close-by. Social grooming activity, however, was impaired in early long-term deprived ex-laboratory <b>chimpanzees</b> {{as well as in}} early maternally deprived zoo <b>chimpanzees</b> compared to non-deprived zoo <b>chimpanzees.</b> Thus, we conclude that early maternal loss has lifelong effects on the social integration of <b>chimpanzees</b> which becomes evident in their grooming networks. Although the retrospective nature of our study prevents a clear causal explanation, our results are of importance for understanding the development of social competence in <b>chimpanzees...</b>|$|R
40|$|Six adult female <b>chimpanzees</b> {{were shown}} video scenes of <b>chimpanzees</b> {{repeatedly}} yawning or of <b>chimpanzees</b> showing open-mouth facial expressions {{that were not}} yawns. Two out of the six females showed significantly higher frequencies of yawning in response to yawn videos; no <b>chimpanzees</b> showed the inverse. Three infant <b>chimpanzees</b> that accompanied their mothers did not yawn at all. These data are highly reminiscent of the contagious yawning effects reported for humans. Contagious yawning {{is thought to be}} based on the capacity for empathy. Contagious yawning in <b>chimpanzees</b> provides further evidence that these apes may possess advanced self-awareness and empathic abilities...|$|R
5|$|Bubbles (born April 30, 1983) is {{a common}} <b>chimpanzee,</b> known for being the {{one-time}} companion animal of American recording artist Michael Jackson, who bought the primate from a Texas research facility in the early 1980s. The animal was a frequent travel companion to the singer, whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery and, among other factors, a public perception of Jackson as eccentric. During the Bad world tour, for example, Jackson brought Bubbles with him to Japan, where they both drank tea with the mayor of Osaka.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles {{was born}} in early 1983 in an Austin, Texas {{research}} facility that bred primates for animal testing. There are conflicting reports as to how he came into Jackson's possession. Multiple reports state that Jackson had Bubbles bought for him when the <b>chimpanzee</b> was eight months old. The acquisition {{was said to have}} been supervised by Bob Dunn, then one of Hollywood's most famous suppliers and trainers of animals for films, photoshoots and advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the <b>chimpanzee</b> but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. <b>Chimpanzee</b> infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E
40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{patterns}} of genetic variation and evolutionary relationships within and between bonobos and <b>chimpanzees,</b> we sequenced 150, 000 base pairs of nuclear DNA divided among 15 autosomal regions {{as well as the}} complete mitochondrial genomes from 20 bonobos and 58 <b>chimpanzees.</b> Except for western <b>chimpanzees,</b> we found poor genetic separation of <b>chimpanzees</b> based on sample locality. In contrast, bonobos consistently cluster together but fall as a group within the variation of <b>chimpanzees</b> for many of the regions. Thus, while <b>chimpanzees</b> retain genomic variation that predates bonobo-chimpanzee speciation, extensive lineage sorting has occurred within bonobos such that much of their genome traces its ancestry back to a single common ancestor that postdates their origin as a group separate from <b>chimpanzees...</b>|$|R
50|$|Common <b>chimpanzees</b> {{have been}} known to attack humans. In Uganda, several attacks on {{children}} have happened, some of them fatal. Some of these attacks {{may be due to the}} <b>chimpanzees</b> being intoxicated (from alcohol obtained from rural brewing operations) and mistaking human children for the western red colobus, one of their favorite meals. Human interactions with <b>chimpanzees</b> may be especially dangerous if the <b>chimpanzees</b> perceive humans as potential rivals. At least six cases of <b>chimpanzees</b> snatching and eating human babies are documented.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chimpanzees</b> are {{a common}} target for poachers. In Ivory Coast, <b>chimpanzees</b> make up 1-3% of {{bushmeat}} sold in urban markets. They are also taken in pet trades despite it being illegal in many countries where they live. <b>Chimpanzees</b> are also hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas. Capturing <b>chimpanzees</b> for scientific research is still allowed in some countries, such as Guinea. People sometimes kill <b>chimpanzees</b> that threaten their crops. Chimps may also be unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals.|$|R
5|$|Even some nonhuman animals show {{a limited}} ability to add, {{particularly}} primates. In a 1995 experiment imitating Wynn's 1992 result (but using eggplants instead of dolls), rhesus macaque and cottontop tamarin monkeys performed similarly to human infants. More dramatically, after being taught {{the meanings of}} the Arabic numerals 0 through 4, one <b>chimpanzee</b> was able to compute the sum of two numerals without further training. More recently, Asian elephants have demonstrated an ability to perform basic arithmetic.|$|E
5|$|Growth of {{the liver}} stages in animal-free systems was {{achieved}} in the 1980s when pre-erythrocytic P. berghei stages were grown in wI38, a human embryonic lung cell line (cells cultured from one specimen). This was followed by their growth in human hepatoma line HepG2. Both P. falciparum and P. vivax have been grown in human liver cells; partial development of P. ovale in human liver cells was achieved; and P. malariae was grown in <b>chimpanzee</b> and monkey liver cells.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{appears to}} have {{originated}} in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects wild chimpanzees (HIV-1 descends from the SIV(cpz) endemic in the <b>chimpanzee</b> subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes). The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an Old World monkey living in litoral West Africa (from southern Senegal to western Côte d'Ivoire). New World monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.|$|E

50|$|The {{significant}} cost {{of caring}} for the approximately 1,000 <b>chimpanzees</b> housed in U.S. research facilities required the development of alternatives to standard laboratory housing for <b>chimpanzees</b> no longer active in research.

5|$|Most {{other mammals}} studied, {{including}} the pig, cow, cat, dog, bushbaby, macaque, <b>chimpanzee</b> and orangutan, {{have a single}} Mup gene. Some, however, have an expanded number: horses have three Mup genes and gray mouse lemurs have at least two. Insects, fish, amphibia, birds and marsupials appear to have disrupted synteny at the chromosomal position of the Mup gene cluster, suggesting the gene family may be specific to placental mammals. Humans are the only placental mammals found {{not to have any}} active Mup genes; instead they have a single Mup pseudogene containing a mutation that causes missplicing, rendering it dysfunctional.|$|E
5|$|Other animals, {{including}} {{whales and}} elephants have larger brains than humans. However, when the brain-to-body mass ratio is taken into account, {{the human brain}} is almost {{twice as large as}} that of a bottlenose dolphin, and three times as large as that of a <b>chimpanzee.</b> However, a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence: very small animals have high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparison}} {{has shown}} these two species diverged around 400,000years ago, more recently than was previously thought. Also, the orangutan genome {{was found to}} have evolved much more slowly than <b>chimpanzee</b> and human DNA. Previously, the species was estimated to have diverged 2.9 to 4.9mya. The researchers hope these data may help conservationists save the endangered ape, and also prove useful in further understanding of human genetic diseases.

5000|$|<b>Chimpanzees</b> {{sometimes}} select bitter {{leaves for}} chewing.

[...] Jane Goodall witnessed <b>chimpanzees</b> eating particular bushes, apparently to make themselves vomit. There are reports that <b>chimpanzees</b> swallow whole leaves of particular rough-leaved plants such as Aneilema aequinoctiale; these remove parasitic worms from their intestines.|$|R

5|$|While {{scholars}} know {{of patriarchal}} and matrifocal ancient societies, very little {{can be said}} about a society of a species, which is as remote as Australopithecus. On the basis of examples in today's <b>chimpanzee</b> and bonobo societies, Klaus Ebner introduced both patriarchal and matriarchal characters in the novel, Costello and Akshaya. Some of the female characters are very strong and self-conscious, such as Akshaya, who is so firm that even Costello s from her. While political power is controlled by the males, the social structure seems matrifocal and matrilineal, corresponding to the image of prehistoric societies exhibited by scholars.|$|E
5|$|During that time, Shapiro {{instructed}} ex-captive orangutans in {{the acquisition}} {{and use of}} signs following the techniques of psychologists R.

In the only signing study ever conducted in a great ape's natural environment, Shapiro home-reared Princess, a juvenile female, which learned nearly 40 signs (according to the criteria of sign acquisition used by psychologist Francine Patterson with Koko, the gorilla) and trained Rinnie, a free-ranging adult female orangutan, which learned nearly 30 signs over a two-year period. For his dissertation study, Shapiro examined the factors influencing sign learning by four juvenile orangutans over a 15-month period.|$|E
40|$|Obesity is a {{risk factor}} for several {{diseases}} including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the relationships of waist circumference and body weight with circulating markers of metabolic, cardiovascular, and hepatic function in <b>chimpanzees</b> (Pan troglodytes). After a 12 -h fast, blood was collected from 39 adult captive <b>chimpanzees</b> for measurement of serum glucose, BUN, creatinine, albumin, cholesterol, ALT, AST, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, triglyceride, and insulin, and waist circumference and body weight were measured. Waist circumference was positively correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glucose, insulin resistance as estimated by the homeostatic model assessment method, and albumin in female <b>chimpanzees</b> and with triglyceride in female and male <b>chimpanzees.</b> Body weight was correlated significantly with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in female <b>chimpanzees</b> and triglyceride in male <b>chimpanzees.</b> Male <b>chimpanzees</b> were heavier and had lower diastolic blood pressure, greater creatinine, albumin, AST, ALP, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin values than did female <b>chimpanzees.</b> The relationships between waist circumference and blood pressure and triglyceride are consistent with those reported in humans and other primate species. In conclusion, our study is the first work to demonstrate a relationship between waist circumference and metabolic risk factors in <b>chimpanzees.</b> Results demonstrated that waist circumference was associated with more metabolic risk factors than was body weight, particularly in female <b>chimpanzees...</b>|$|R
40|$|In humans, {{clearance}} {{of hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection {{is associated with}} genetic variation near the IL- 28 B gene and the induction of interferon-stimulated genes, like IP- 10. Also in <b>chimpanzees</b> spontaneous clearance of HCV is observed. To study whether similar correlations exist in these animals, a direct comparison of IP- 10 and IL- 28 B polymorphism between <b>chimpanzees</b> and patients was performed. All <b>chimpanzees</b> studied were monomorphic for the human IL- 28 B SNPs which are associated with spontaneous and treatment induced HCV clearance in humans. As a result, these particular SNPs cannot be used for clinical association studies in <b>chimpanzees.</b> Although these human SNPs were absent in <b>chimpanzees,</b> gene variation in this region was present however, no correlation was observed between different SNP-genotypes and HCV outcome. Strikingly, IP- 10 levels in <b>chimpanzees</b> correlated with HCV-RNA load and cGT, while such correlations were not observed in humans. The correlation between IP- 10, cGT and virus load in <b>chimpanzees</b> was not found in patients and {{may be due to}} the lack of lifestyle-related confounding factors in <b>chimpanzees.</b> Direct comparison of IP- 10 and IL- 28 B polymorphism between <b>chimpanzees</b> and patients in relation to HCV infection, illustrates that the IFN-pathways are important during HCV infection in both species.
