40|$|This paper {{analyses}} a fourteen-year {{period of}} Western Australian {{data from the}} <b>client</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> of the Department for Child Protection and Family Support. Western Australia saw a large {{increase in the number}} of children in state care similar to trends across Australia as a whole. The study shows the following trends: changes in response to 'referrals' with particular increases in the number of findings of neglect and increasing proportions of these followed swiftly by entry to care; changes in patterns of entry to care with more children under one-year-old entering; increased length of stay of children in care; and, the high incidence of Aboriginal children entering and remaining in care. The data demonstrate unequivocally that increased 'referrals' are not associated with increased substantiations of harm or 'acts of commission with dangerous intent', but that neglect assessed early in the lives of children was the major precipitant for entry to care and particularly so for Aboriginal infants.

As the scale and complexity of such delivery systems has increased, the use of computer-based information systems has become a necessity. The evolution of a <b>client</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> in a large, decentralized mental health center is reviewed in this paper to illustrate several critical issues that can be encountered {{in the application of}} computer-based technology to human services. An analysis of the center's existing information system and the development of the data forms and procedures necessary for a second-generation system to meet information needs revealed the unique data structure and analysis problems of human service delivery systems. These problems were complicated by regulatory agencies' imposition of external reporting requirements that frequently were unpredictable and inconsistent. Finally, planning and negotiations with the participation of all involved parties demonstrated that formal and informal administrative constraints and conflicting interests within human service organizations must be accommodated or a system may fail. All of these factors combine to highlight both the problems and the need for highly flexible multipurpose information systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In South Africa, {{district}} {{social service}} offices {{are often the}} first point of entry into the substance abuse treatment system. Despite this, {{little is known about}} the profile of people presenting with substance-related problems at these service points. This has a negative impact on treatment service planning. This paper begins to redress this gap through describing patterns of substance use and service needs among people using general social services in the Western Cape and comparing findings against the profile of persons attending specialist substance abuse treatment facilities in the region. Methods As part of a standard <b>client</b> <b>information</b> <b>system,</b> an electronic questionnaire was completed for each person seeking social assistance. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, the range of presenting problems, patterns of substance use, perceived consequences of substance use, as well as types of services provided were analysed for the 691 social welfare clients who reported substance use between 2007 and 2009. These data were compared against clients attending substance abuse treatment centres during the same time period. Results Findings indicate that social services offices are used as a way of accessing specialist services but are also used as a service point, especially by groups under-represented in the specialist treatment sector. Women, people from rural communities and people with alcohol-related problems are more likely to seek assistance at social service offices providing low threshold intervention services than from the specialist treatment sector. Conclusions The study provides evidence that social services are a point of entry and intervention for people from underserved communities in the Western Cape. If these low-threshold services can be supported to provide good quality services, they may be an effective and efficient way of improving access to treatment in a context of limited service availability. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} multi-method research approach for {{the systematic study}} of wicked problem domains (Rittel, 1984 [1972]), developed through an investigation of an information system (IS) within a health service organisation, BreastScreen Tasmania (BST). BST is an accredited organisation within a national screening and assessment Progam, BreastScreen Australia. The Program is a population health initiative that also provides multi-disciplinary diagnostic clinical services to individual clients/patients, measured against 176 National Accreditation Standards. The demographic change of ageing population is a crisis that threatens the sustainability of future health services and highlights a role for IS/ICT to deliver work efficiencies. Conflicting perspectives and competing models for assuring the quality and safety of health services assume a role for IS/ICT to provide data processing capabilities to support health service practices and to evaluate health service outcomes. An ‘e-health’ vision assumes that well-integrated information and standardised work practices will result in efficiency, effectiveness, safety and quality. But IS/ICT solutions often fail to accommodate the complexities of information use in health settings. This situation of competing perspectives, opposing forces and health IS/ICT failures indicates that health service delivery into the future is a wicked problem that cannot be easily defined {{and will not be}} solved by better IS design. The methodological contribution of this research is a structured process of inquiry that emphasises a human-centred perspective: patient-centred care, human centred computing and human centred research. The dissertation shows how a multi-method approach is systematically conducted, how appreciation of a problem situation for an organisation emerges and is studied over three-phases. Soft Systems Methodology was adopted as the conceptual framework for the research process. Grounded Theory Methodology provided a range of flexible strategies and lenses for qualitative data collection and analysis. A construct, ‘People, place and things’ (PPT), was developed and used as a heuristic device to sensitise the researcher to different units of analysis, techniques and lenses for structuring and modelling data, particularly drawing on Distributed Cognition, Communities of Practice and Activity Theory. Substantively, the research contributes a detailed single case of a health service delivery organisation with wicked problem properties. The investigation focused on the role and impact of a client record (electronic and paper) on two BST activities and their inter-relationships. Firstly, accrediting the delivery of its breast screening and assessment services and secondly supporting decision-making of both individual clinicians and clients/patients. More broadly, it also analysed how the IS impacted on the roles and interactions amongst the professionals working within BST. BST’s problem situation was identified as a nexus between accreditation and practice in which two forms of accreditation are in tension. These tensions are embedded in the information system supporting BST activities. BST uses a <b>client</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> to measure its performance at organisation level, which can conflict with social forms of accreditation such as professional memberships. This conflict is mirrored by the difference between population-level, evidence-oriented data and the meaning of data {{in the context of a}} specific client receiving a health service. Theoretically, the research contributes two conceptual models. Model one highlights that the nexus is embedded in the organisation’s information system and work practice design such that two forms of accreditation are in tension and must be managed. Artefacts used to measure performance construct organisation-level accreditation; individuals are accredited socially via membership. Model two highlights that the client record is fully integrated to provide data that is oriented to support three different purposes: evidence of organisation performance, supporting professional judgment and client decision-making. Boundary maintenance activities by a staff member in the role of institutional broker are required to manage the differences in meaning for each information orientation. This research has implications for the role of IS/ICT in health service delivery and accreditation, including assumptions on the benefits of information integration and work practice standardisation. IS design can readily embed principles and work processes that align with measuring standardised work by population-level data for health service quality assurance. However, the wicked problem characteristics affecting health services means that IS that prioritises population-level data-oriented accrediting models can fail to provide information to support social information interactions, including how work is measured for quality within professional memberships. In addition, providing an information system to monitor performance is important, but IS/ICT is also needed to effectively support health service practitioners and clients in making decisions and to provide feedback on individual performance. The outcomes of using this method demonstrate the value of a three phase, process inquiry approach utilising multiple methods. Socio-technical perspectives are useful for understanding wicked problem domains and the PPT-construct keeps the analysis open to a range of insights for understanding the information support provided in the context of health care delivery. Identifying social insights and social methods of measuring quality of performance of relevance to IS design is time consuming but critical to facilitate human-centred uses of information being supported by the design of technical artefacts for health service delivery contexts. IS design to support standardised work processes and that embeds non-social, quantitative forms of measuring that work is relatively straightforward. Understanding, modelling and developing IS that reflects social insights is much more complex but critical if the e-health IS are to have a positive impact on the current vision for patient-centred, safe and quality assured, effective and efficient health services into the future...|$|E

The {{primary goal}} {{of this study was}} to analyze {{completion}} rates of clients in drug and alcohol abuse treatment programs in Washington State and to assess the factors associated with treatment completion. A secondary goal was to examine the utility of a state <b>information</b> <b>system</b> as a source of evaluative data. METHODS. Analyses were conducted of 5827 client records contained in the Washington State Substance Abuse Monitoring System, representing a census of public clients discharged during the last quarter of 1990 from all state-funded alcohol and drug treatment programs in four treatment modalities. Logistic regression was performed to determine the independent predictors of treatment completion. RESULTS. Completion rates were highest for intensive inpatient alcohol treatment (75 %) and lowest for intensive outpatient drug programs (18 %). Factors associated with treatment completion included screening at a referral assessment center, education, age, ethnicity, and existence of a secondary drug problem. CONCLUSIONS. The fit between clients and treatment programs may be an important factor explaining why some clients complete treatment and others drop out.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} how the deductive power of PROLOG can bemade available across the Internet using standardized Web service technologies. This facilitates the use of PROLOG {{as a component of}} distributed information sys-tems and in many new application scenarios. Since a lot of information available on the Internet is nowadays XML based and since Web service technologies useX ML based encodings, it is both necessary and useful to be able to process XMLdocuments in P ROLOG itself. To make this possible, a new package for SWI-P ROLOG called X 2 P is introduced, making available to PROLOG many of theX ML processing facilities of the Libxml 2 library, which is a very up-to-dateand efficient implementation of most of the current X ML related standards. 1 Motivation and Overview The World Wide Web as we know it today, was initially designed as a platform forinformation sharing. The core Web technologies, i. e. H TTP, HTML, Web servers andWeb browsers, enable the exchange of information in the form of documents. Web browsers soon became standard tools and it was realized that they can also beused as universal <b>clients</b> to <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> if these <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> expose their user interface using HTML documents. Most modern <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> use sucha Web based architecture. Tools like application servers simplify the development of Web based <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> at the server side. The development and deployment of distributed <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> which integrate applications that are distributed on an Intranet or even on the Internet, is still a lotmore difficult. The need for such an (enterprise) application integration over the Web was initially generated mainly by business to business (B 2 B) applications.
