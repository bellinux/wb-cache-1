5|$|The {{full name}} of the Church is Iglesia del Dios Vivo <b>Columna</b> y Apoyo de la Verdad, La Luz del Mundo ("Church of the Living God, Column and Support of The Truth, The Light of The World") which is derived from two {{passages}} in the Bible, Matthew 5:14 and 1 Timothy 3:15.|$|E
25|$|Each {{year and}} since 1812, {{the image of}} Jesus, {{depicted}} tied to a column and beaten, called the Señor de la <b>Columna,</b> has traveled in procession between Atotonilco and San Miguel de Allende. In 1812, the image was requested due to an epidemic that was plaguing the town. Today, and each year on the Saturday prior to Holy Week, it travels to San Miguel and returns to Atotonilco on Thursday night.|$|E
25|$|The {{most useful}} books of botany, {{pharmacy}} and medicine used {{by students and}} scholars were supplemented commentaries on Dioscorides, including the works of Fuchs, Anguillara, Mattioli, Maranta, Cesalpino, Dodoens, Fabius <b>Columna,</b> Gaspard and Johann Bauhin, and De Villanueva/Servetus. In several of these versions, the annotations and comments exceed the Dioscoridean text and have much new botany. Printers were not merely printing the authentic materia medica, but hiring experts on the medical and botanical field for criticism, commentaries, that would raise the stature of the printers and the work.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} section there is a {{representation}} of Jesus {{in the house of}} Caiaphus. Seventy two judges try Jesus with Pontius Pilate on the side in the balcony. On the north side, Pilate appears again but the Jewish judges stay outside the Roman magistrate's house because they are observing Passover. The south side presents Pilate presenting Jesus and Barabbas and asking to choose who to let go. On the east side is a scene with Jesus being flogged while tied to a post. On the south wall there is a Neoclassical altarpiece of stone with gold leaf. This contains an image of Christ tied to a post and bearing the marks of being flogged. This is called the Señor de la <b>Columna.</b>|$|E
25|$|On November 18, 1955, a non-violent {{splinter}} group of nationalists calling themselves La Quinta <b>Columna</b> (The 5th Column) {{broke away from}} the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party due to not supporting the ideas and thoughts of Albizu Campos, as to a Puerto Rico relationship with Spain as its Mother country and their nationalistic love for Puerto Rico as their Motherland. The other reason for the {{splinter group}} was due to the violence {{that took place in the}} 1950s. This splinter group would later become known in 1968 as El Movimiento Indio Taino de Boriken (The Taino Indian Movement of Puerto Rico) which was primarily made up of the children of the Puerto Rican Nationalists whom would come to establish the indigenous grassroots civil rights movement in Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|Success at Mylae {{allowed the}} Romans to pursue Hannibal at Sardinia, where the Romans again {{destroyed}} {{a large part}} of the Carthaginian fleet. At this point Hannibal was arrested by his own men back in Carthage and crucified for his incompetence. As for Duilius, a <b>columna</b> rostrata, or victory column, was raised with an inscription in his honor in the Forum. The remnants of this inscription were found at Rome and are now kept in the Capitoline Museum. The inscription reports that during the Battle of Mylae Duilius captured 31 ships, sunk 13 more, and took booty of gold and silver worth at least 2,100,000 sesterces. Upon returning home Duilius received Rome’s first naval triumph, which the inscription boasts was the first triumph to include native free-born Carthaginians. Despite his success, Duilius never held another office of high command, although he became censor in 258 BC.|$|E

25|$|By 1881, {{having been}} {{exempted}} from his compulsory {{term in the}} Romanian Land Forces as the eldest son of a widow, the young man went on to study at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Letters. Taught and regarded with admiration by academic Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Șăineanu was primarily a student of etymology, stylistics and semantics (which {{formed the basis of}} his first three studies, published in 1882 and 1887). He published his first study, the 1883 Câteva specimene de etimologie populară română ("A Few Samples of Romanian Folk Etymology"), in Hasdeu's magazine <b>Columna</b> lui Traian. By then, Șăineanu had begun contributing to Anuar pentru Israeliți ("The Yearbook for Israelites"), the Hebraist magazine edited by his friends and fellow scholars Moses Gaster and Moses Schwartzfeld, which mainly published articles on Jewish history and espoused a moderate assimilationist agenda (Haskalah). Gaster also sent Șăineanu's various studies on folklore and linguistics also published in Revista pentru Istorie, Arheologie și Filologie, a review founded and led by Romanian historian Grigore Tocilescu. The direct contacts between the two scholars ended in 1885, when Gaster was expelled from Romania for protesting against the antisemitic measures condoned by the National Liberal Party cabinet of Ion Brătianu.|$|E
500|$|The Iglesia del Dios Vivo, <b>Columna</b> y Apoyo de la Verdad, La Luz del Mundo, (English: [...] "Church of the Living God, Column and Ground of the Truth, The Light of the World")or simply La Luz del Mundois a Christian {{denomination}} [...] {{with international}} headquarters in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. La Luz del Mundo (abbreviated LLDM, or sometimes The LDM) practices {{a form of}} restorationist theology centered on three leaders: founder Aarónborn EusebioJoaquín González (1896–1964), Samuel Joaquín Flores (1937–2014), and Naasón Joaquin García (born 1969). These three men are regarded by the Church as modern day Apostles of Jesus Christ and Servants of God.|$|E
500|$|In 1934, {{a temple}} {{was built in}} Sector Libertad of Guadalajara's urban zone and members were {{encouraged}} to buy homes {{in the same neighborhood}} thereby establishing a community. The temple was registered as Iglesia Cristiana Espiritual (Spiritual Christian Church) but Joaquín claimed to have received God's word in the dedication of the temple, saying that it was [...] "light of the world" [...] and that they were the Iglesia del Dios Vivo, <b>Columna</b> y Apoyo de la Verdad (Church of the Living God, Column and Ground of the Truth). The Church used the latter name to identify itself. In 1939, it moved to a new meeting place at 12 de Octubre street in San Antonio in southeast Guadalajara, forming its second small community which was populated mainly by its members. This community was an attempt to escape the hostile environment, not to create an egalitarian society.|$|E
50|$|For {{some time}} after this other {{opinions}} prevailed in the Augustinian Order.

Researcher George Porta suggests that Florescu never actually took hold of his chair, being snubbed by two successive Education Ministers: Christian Tell and Vasile Boerescu. However, his introductory lesson was published in Hasdeu's newspaper, <b>Columna</b> lui Traian, which also hosted Florescu's homage to the retiring poet Grigore Alexandrescu. During his time in Iași, Florescu, supported by physician Anastasie Fătu, also founded and operated an adult high school.|$|E
