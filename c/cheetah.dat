5|$|The king <b>cheetah</b> is {{a variety}} of <b>cheetah</b> with a rare {{mutation}} for cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark, wide stripes extending from their neck to the tail. In 1926 Major A.Cooper wrote about an animal he had shot near modern-day Harare. Describing the animal, he noted its remarkable similarity to the <b>cheetah,</b> but the body of this individual was covered with fur as thick {{as that of a}} snow leopard and the spots merged to form stripes. He suggested that it could be a cross between a leopard and a <b>cheetah.</b> After further similar animals were discovered, it was established they were similar to the <b>cheetah</b> in having non-retractable clawsa characteristic feature of the <b>cheetah.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{literature}} mentions the <b>cheetah.</b> In 1969 author Joy Adamson, of Born Free fame, wrote The Spotted Sphinx, {{a biography of}} her pet <b>cheetah</b> Pippa. Hussein, An Entertainment, a novel by Patrick O'Brian set in the British Raj period in India, illustrates the practice of royalty keeping and training cheetahs to hunt antelopes. The book How It Was with Dooms tells {{the true story of}} a family raising an orphaned <b>cheetah</b> cub named Dooms in Kenya. The 2005 film Duma was loosely based on this book.|$|E
5|$|Agonistic vocalisations: Eklund {{used this}} term as a {{reference}} to a combination of growls, moans, and hisses that is followed by spitting, a feature more conspicuous in <b>cheetah</b> than in other cats. In addition to spitting, the <b>cheetah</b> will hit the ground with its front paws.|$|E
50|$|Historically, it was {{believed}} all <b>cheetahs</b> were genetically homogenous. This changed in January 2011, when the Asiatic <b>cheetahs</b> and the Sudan <b>cheetahs</b> were revealed to be distinct even from their closest relatives from South Africa.|$|R

50|$|The <b>cheetahs</b> from Africa and Asia were {{previously}} considered as genetically identical to each other. Until DNA researches and analysis started in early 1990s {{showed that the}} South African <b>cheetahs</b> and East African <b>cheetahs</b> are indeed separate subspecies.|$|R
5|$|Being in {{the genus}} Acinonyx, the {{morphology}} of the <b>cheetah</b> differs notably {{from the big}} cats (genus Panthera). The face and the jaw are unusually shortened and the sagittal crest is poorly developed, possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed. In fact, the skull resembles that of the smaller cats. Another point of similarity to the small cats is the long and flexible spine, {{in contrast to the}} stiff and short one of other large felids. A 2001 study of felid morphology stated that the truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in the <b>cheetah</b> at a relatively younger age than other felids could be a major reason for the peculiar morphology of the <b>cheetah.</b> Interestingly, the <b>cheetah</b> appears to show convergent evolution with canids in morphology as well as behaviour. For example, the <b>cheetah</b> has a relatively long snout, long legs and deep chest, tough foot pads and blunt, semi-retractable claws; moreover, its hunting behaviour resembles that of canids. In the 2001 study, it was observed that the claws of <b>cheetah</b> have features intermediate between those of felids and the wolf. In the Puma lineage, the cheetah's skull morphology {{is similar to that of}} the pumaboth have short, wide skullswhile that of the jaguarundi is different.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cheetah</b> fossils {{found in}} the lower beds of the Olduvai Gorge site in {{northern}} Tanzania {{date back to the}} Pleistocene. The extinct species of Acinonyx are older than the <b>cheetah,</b> with the oldest known from the late Pliocene; these fossils are about three million years old. These species include Acinonyx pardinensis (Pliocene epoch), notably larger than the modern <b>cheetah,</b> and A.intermedius (mid-Pleistocene period). While the range of A.intermedius stretched from Europe to China, Apardinensis spanned over Eurasia as well as eastern and southern Africa. A variety of larger <b>cheetah</b> believed to have existed in Europe fell to extinction around half a million years ago.|$|E
5|$|South African <b>cheetah</b> (A. j. jubatus) (Schreber, 1775): Also {{called the}} Namibian <b>cheetah.</b> The {{nominate}} subspecies {{and the most}} numerous of the cheetahs. Occurs in southern African countries such as Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique and Zambia. Went extinct from Lesotho and southern Congo-Kinshasa. Introduced in the Hlane Royal National Park of Swaziland and reintroduced in the Liwonde National Park of Malawi. Separated from the Asiatic <b>cheetah</b> nearly 0.32–0.67 million years ago. In 2007 the population was roughly estimated at less than 5,000 to maximum 6,500 adult individuals. The South African <b>cheetah</b> populations are increasing in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. Once thought to be extinct for 30 years, wild cheetahs were reported to persist Iona National Park in southwestern Angola {{for the first time}} in 2010. Since 1999, they suffered a massive decline in Zimbabwe, as well as in Mozambique following the civil wars during 1980-90s. Not listed by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|Historically, South African <b>cheetahs</b> were {{widespread}} across west, {{north and}} southern {{regions of the}} country. By 1975, {{it was estimated that}} 200 individuals persisted in Mozambique. Although, the <b>cheetahs</b> lost most of their range during the Mozambican Civil War due to intense poaching on the <b>cheetahs</b> and prey base. However, recent researches and camera traps since 2004 and 2011 revealed constant presences of <b>cheetahs</b> and other healthy populations of predators and herbivorous mammals in the conservation areas of Mozambique in Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park. It is estimated that 35 <b>cheetahs</b> live in Limpopo National Park.|$|R
50|$|Both continents of Africa and Asia had 100,000 <b>cheetahs</b> in the 19th century. Sudan <b>cheetahs</b> {{were once}} {{numerous}} in north, central {{and in the}} Horn of Africa. They ranged in Egypt and Libya on northern Africa, from Somalia to Niger on northeastern and central Africa. <b>Cheetahs</b> {{are known to be}} tamed, trained and to hunt herbivorous animals. Once existed in Egypt, the Ancient Egyptians often kept the <b>cheetahs</b> and raised them as pets, and also tamed and trained them for hunting mammals. Tamed <b>cheetahs</b> were taken to open hunting fields in low-sided carts or by horseback, hooded and blindfolded, and kept on leashes. When the prey was near enough, the <b>cheetahs</b> would be released to go after it.|$|R
50|$|Prior the {{population}} decline, the South African <b>cheetahs</b> were more widespread in Zimbabwe and its population had excellent growth rate, in which over 1,500 individuals thrived. Back in 1973, {{it was estimated}} that 400 <b>cheetahs</b> lived in Zimbabwe and has increased to 470 in 1987. Afterwards in 1991, a total population of 1,391 <b>cheetahs</b> were found by the Zimbabwe Department of Parks and Wildlife Management, whilst in 1996, a population of 728 <b>cheetahs</b> lived on commercial farmlands alone. In 1999, a minimum total population of 1,520 were estimated, in which over 1 200 of these <b>cheetahs</b> lived on commercial farmlands while 320 were found in National Parks. A year later, several reports questioned whether the Zimbabwean <b>cheetahs</b> were stable or decreasing, however it was increasing at the time. However, <b>cheetahs</b> are known to be highly threatened in farmlands in which between 1999 and 2007, 80% of {{the population}} of Zimbabwean <b>cheetahs</b> living in private farmlands fell into massive decline due to human-cheetah conflict, reduced to over a thousand to less than 400 of its total population in the country as of 2007. It was known that about 100 <b>cheetahs</b> were killed by livestock farmers in Zimbabwe's lowveld per year. Following years later, there are about 150 to 170 adult <b>cheetahs</b> and the human-cheetah conflict is no longer a major threat to the species. Most of the South African <b>cheetahs</b> live in Zimbabwean protected areas today.|$|R
5|$|Tanzanian <b>cheetah</b> (A. j. raineyi syn. A. j. fearsoni) (Heller, 1913): Also {{called the}} East African <b>cheetah.</b> Found in Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, and Uganda. The total {{population}} in 2007 {{was estimated at}} 2,572 adults and independent adolescents. Significant populations occur in the Maasai Mara and the Serengeti ecoregions.|$|E
5|$|The Range Wide Conservation Program for <b>Cheetah</b> and African Wild Dogs (RWCP), {{the brainchild}} of Sarah Durant and Rosie Woodroffe (of the Zoological Society of London), was started in 2007 with the primary aim of {{ensuring}} better conservation measures for the <b>cheetah</b> and the wild dogtwo species with very low population densities. A joint initiative by the ZSL, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and the IUCN Cat Specialist Group, the program has among its major goals {{a review of the}} conservation policies adopted by the South African countries, and study and action on illegal hunting and trade of the <b>cheetah.</b> In a 2007 publication, Durant emphasised the role of land management and improvement in connectivity across the range in <b>cheetah</b> conservation, in the lack of which the populations might face severe fragmentation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cheetah</b> {{has been}} widely portrayed {{in a variety of}} artistic works. In Bacchus and Ariadne, an oil {{painting}} by the 16th-century Italian painter Titian, the chariot of the Greek god Dionysus (Bacchus) is depicted as being drawn by two cheetahs. The cheetahs in the painting were previously considered to be leopards. In 1764 English painter George Stubbs commemorated the gifting of a <b>cheetah</b> to George III by the English Governor of Madras, Sir George Pigot in his painting <b>Cheetah</b> with Two Indian Attendants and a Stag. The painting depicts a <b>cheetah,</b> hooded and collared by two Indian servants, along with a stag it was supposed to prey upon. The 1896 painting The Caress, by the 19th-century Belgian symbolist painter Fernand Khnopff, is a representation of the myth of Oedipus and the Sphinx. It portrays a creature with a woman's head and a cheetah's body (often misidentified as a leopard's).|$|E
50|$|Although, <b>cheetahs</b> {{were not}} common in South Africa. Except, as of now, the country {{contains}} the third-largest population of <b>cheetahs</b> {{after years of}} conservation actions and reintroductions into the wild. In 2016, it is estimated about 1,500 adult <b>cheetahs</b> live in the wild.|$|R
50|$|The Chicago <b>Cheetahs</b> were a {{professional}} roller hockey team based in Chicago, Illinois, United States that played in Roller Hockey International. The <b>Cheetahs</b> joined {{the league in}} 1994. The <b>Cheetahs</b> were part-owned by basketball legend George Mikan.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/magazine/06/02/mikan.9.22.94/ Former Chicago Blackhawks star Al Secord {{was part of the}} <b>Cheetahs</b> in 1994, as were future Chicago Wolves players Bobby Nardella, Jeff Rohlicek, Ed Anderson and Tim Breslin. The <b>Cheetahs</b> played at the UIC Pavilion during the 1994 Regular Season, but moved their playoff home games to the Odeum in Villa Park to save money. Co-owner Mike Ryan then moved all <b>Cheetahs</b> home contests to the Odeum in 1995. <b>Cheetahs</b> games home and away in 1994 and their playoff games in 1995 were carried on WAUR (930-AM) Radio with Les Grobstein handling the play-by-play. The franchise folded after their second season as several checks made out by Ryan bounced.|$|R
50|$|In Somalia, Tanzanian <b>cheetahs</b> feed on Soemmerring's gazelles. Historically, Speke's gazelles fell {{prey to the}} <b>cheetahs,</b> {{which were}} {{formerly}} the main prey of the Tanzanian <b>cheetahs</b> in semi-deserts and grass steppes of the Horn of Africa. However, it suffers from population decline and habitat degradation.|$|R
5|$|The <b>cheetah</b> is {{threatened}} by habitat loss through agricultural and industrial expansion; moreover, the animal apparently requires a large area to live in as indicated by its low population densities. The <b>cheetah</b> appears to be less capable than the leopard of coexisting with humans. As such, human interference can disturb the activities, such as hunting and feeding, of <b>cheetah.</b> With 76% of their range consisting of unprotected land, the <b>cheetah</b> are often targeted by farmers and pastoralists who attempt to protect their livestock. However, cheetahs typically do not prefer livestock for prey. Game hunters may also try to harm <b>cheetah</b> as these carnivores can deprive them of valuable game. Roadkill can be another threat, especially in areas where roads have been constructed near the natural habitat or protected areas. Cases of roadkill involving cheetahs have been reported from Kalmand, Tūrān, and Bafq. The threat is posed by infectious diseases is minor, given the low population densities and hence the minimal chance of infection.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the <b>cheetah.</b> Saharan <b>cheetah</b> have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and rounded, the ears are marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of the ears are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the <b>cheetah.</b> These streaks originate {{from the corner of}} the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield for the eyes against the sun's glare, a helpful feature as the <b>cheetah</b> hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|The paws of the <b>cheetah</b> are {{narrower}} {{than those}} of other felids. The slightly curved claws lack a protective sheath and are weakly retractable (semi-retractable). This is a major point of difference between the <b>cheetah</b> and the big cats, which have fully retractable claws, and a similarity to canids. Additionally, the claws of the <b>cheetah</b> are shorter as well as straighter {{than those of}} other cats. Absence of protection makes the claws blunt; however, the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} {{adverse reactions}} to oral administration {{of a combination}} of praziquantel and pyrantel embonate or pyrantel pamoate, with or without oxantel embonate, in captive <b>cheetahs</b> (Acinonyx jubatus). Design: Retrospective case series and case-control study. Animals: 16 captive <b>cheetahs</b> with signs of adverse reaction to oral administration of praziquantel and pyrantel, with or without oxantel embonate (affected group), and 27 <b>cheetahs</b> without such reactions (unaffected group), all from 3 independent facilities. Procedures: Medical records and postmortem findings for affected <b>cheetahs</b> were reviewed and compared with those of unaffected animals. Anthelmintic doses administered, age, and sex of <b>cheetahs</b> were compared between groups. Results: 3 reactions in affected <b>cheetahs</b> were fatal, whereas the remainder ranged from mild to severe. Postmortem examination failed to reveal any disease processes or conditions to explain the deaths. No differences in anthelmintic dose were identified between affected and unaffected <b>cheetahs</b> for all facilities combined, and no correlation existed between dose and reaction severity. No association with sex was detected, but affected <b>cheetahs</b> were significantly younger than unaffected <b>cheetahs.</b> This difference was not significant after controlling for facility. Conclusions and clinical relevance: <b>Cheetahs</b> were concluded to have had an adverse reaction to the praziquantel-pyrantel combination because of temporal proximity of onset of clinical signs to dose administration, similarity of signs to those reported for toxicosis in other species for these drugs, and a lack of other disease process or environmental explanatory factors. A highly cautious approach to the use of this drug combination is recommended for <b>cheetahs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Published haematologic and serum {{biochemistry}} reference intervals {{are very}} scarce for captive <b>cheetahs</b> {{and even more}} for free-ranging <b>cheetahs.</b> The current study was performed to establish reference intervals for selected serum biochemistry analytes in <b>cheetahs.</b> Baseline serum biochemistry analytes were analysed from 66 healthy Namibian <b>cheetahs.</b> Samples were collected from 30 captive <b>cheetahs</b> at the AfriCat Foundation and 36 free-ranging <b>cheetahs</b> from central Namibia. The effects of captivity-status, age, sex and haemolysis score on the tested serum analytes were investigated. The biochemistry analytes that were measured were sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride, urea and creatinine. The 90 % confidence interval of the reference limits was obtained using the non-parametric bootstrap method. Reference intervals were preferentially determined by the non-parametric method and were as follows: sodium (128 mmol/L – 166 mmol/L), potassium (3. 9 mmol/L – 5. 2 mmol/L), magnesium (0. 8 mmol/L – 1. 2 mmol/L), chloride (97 mmol/L – 130 mmol/L), urea (8. 2 mmol/L – 25. 1 mmol/L) and creatinine (88 µmol/L – 288 µmol/L). Reference intervals from the current study were compared with International Species Information System values for <b>cheetahs</b> and found to be narrower. Moreover, age, sex and haemolysis score had no {{significant effect on the}} serum analytes in this study. Separate reference intervals for captive and free-ranging <b>cheetahs</b> were also determined. Captive <b>cheetahs</b> had higher urea values, most likely due to dietary factors. This study is the first to establish reference intervals for serum biochemistry analytes in <b>cheetahs</b> according to international guidelines. These results can be used for future health and disease assessments in both captive and free-ranging <b>cheetahs...</b>|$|R
