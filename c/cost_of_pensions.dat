40|$|The New Zealand {{government}} {{provides a}} universal pension to citizens {{over the age}} of sixty-five years. The basis for this is widely understood as a ‘social contract’ between generations in which tax-payers fund income support for the older generation of the day. As demographics shift markedly towards an older population, concerns about the future <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> are apparent in New Zealand politics, media and everyday conversations. Data for this project was collected from two newspaper articles that discussed the future <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>pensions,</b> and from 233 online public responses to these articles. Rhetorical analyses of both the articles and the public responses were undertaken. The results consisted of three main findings. Firstly, accounts that emphasised intergenerational inequity generated antagonism and widened divisions between generational groups. Secondly, New Zealanders prominently constructed the state-funded pension as a return for a lifetime of economic contributions. Lastly the discussions of New Zealanders reflected a shift in understandings about the responsibility for the funding of income in retirement, with expectations that individuals should prepare financially for their own retirement apparent. These understandings around income support for older people appear incongruent with the current universal pension, and raise questions about its status. The focus on intergenerational issues may overlook other kinds of inequity in retirement. The invocation of economic contributions as the basis for pension deservingness has implications for those without a steady history of paid work...|$|E

40|$|This {{working party}} has {{considered}} the pensions {{implications of a}} prolonged period of low inflation.

40|$|It is {{excellent}} news {{that people are}} on average living so much longer than was the case 60 years ago. A man retiring at 65 in 1948, when the universal state pension {{was introduced in the}} UK, lived on average for another 12 years. Such a man retiring now will probably live for another 21 years.

Furthermore, the rapid pace of change makes the future increasingly uncertain to predict. Insurers have also encountered problems in responding to these rapid changes.

Equally, it is just as important not to overstate the possibilities, which could have serious economic consequences by tying up capital unnecessarily.

Government spending is reduced by austerity measures and lower tax income. In the private sector several groups are not welcome: migrants, personel over 50, and younsters without experience.

40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years, the extent of defined benefit {{provision}} has declined substantially in the United Kingdom. Whilst most of the {{focus has been on}} deficits relating to past benefit accrual, the increasing cost of future benefit accrual is also important. There are two reasons for this. First, the change in the cost of defined benefit accrual represents the difference in the earnings for employees with membership of a defined benefit scheme and those with membership of a defined contribution scheme. Second, the current cost of defined benefit accrual gives an indication of the cost of an adequate pension. As such, it can be compared with levels of contribution to defined contribution schemes to determine whether these are adequate. I therefore look at how the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> has changed relative to the cost of non-pensions earnings. I also look at the main components of the change in pensions cost - those relating to benefits payable, discount rates and longevi ty - to analyse their relative importance.

I also find that the current cost of accrual is significantly higher than the average level of payments to defined contribution schemes...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century more people are living into their seventies, eighties, nineties and beyond, a process {{expected}} to continue well into the next millennium. The twentieth century has achieved what people in other centuries only dreamed of: many can now expect to survive to old age in reasonably good health and can remain active and independent to the end, in contrast to the high death rate, ill health and destitution which affected all ages in the past. Yet this change is generally greeted not with triumph but with alarm. It is assumed that the longer people live, the longer they are ill and dependent, thus burdening a shrinking younger generation with the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> and health care. It is also widely believed that 'the past' saw few survivors into old age and these could be supported by their families without involving the taxpayer. In this first survey of old age throughout English history, these assumptions are challenged. Vivid pictures are given of the ways in which very large numbers of older people lived often vigorous and independent lives over many centuries. The book argues that old people have always been highly visible in English communities, and concludes that as people live longer due to the benefits of the rise in living standards, far from being 'burdens' they can be valuable contributors to their family and friends...|$|E

40|$|Municipal {{bond prices}} are {{tumbling}} and rates rising just as public borrowers face pressure to refinance deals cut during the financial crisis. At the same time, the funded status of public pension plans has declined, and {{states and localities}} {{will have to come}} up with more money to meet future benefit payments. In the private sector, numerous studies have shown that pension underfunding affects corporate bond ratings. And Moody’s just announced that it would combine unfunded pension liabilities with outstanding bonds when evaluating a state’s leverage position. These developments raise the question of how future pension commitments affect today’s borrowing costs in the public sector. The brief proceeds as follows. The first section describes the municipal bond market. The second section describes the factors that traditionally have been considered in the bond rating process. The third section summarizes what other researchers have found regarding the relationship between pension commitments and borrowing costs in the private and public sectors. The fourth section presents a model for the period 2005 - 2009 that relates borrowing costs to factors generally considered by the rating agencies, such as the state’s management, finances, economy, and debt structure. Pensions are a component of the debt structure, and the extent to which states make their Annual Required Contribution (ARC) has a statistically significant – albeit modest – impact on the cost of debt. A side finding is that the bond’s rating explains relatively little about the variation in interest cost, and the effect of pensions remains significant even including the bond’s rating in the equation. The final section concludes that while pension underfunding had only a small effect on borrowing costs in the 2005 - 2009 period when pension expenses were only 3 to 4 percent of state budgets, its impact could become more significant as the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> increases. ...|$|E

Industry-wide pension funds are significantly more efficient than company funds and other funds.
