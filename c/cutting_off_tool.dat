40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{tool life}} extension methods applied to cut-off tools made of high-speed steel. Despite the wide application of cutting tools made of sintered carbides, which {{is becoming the}} main cutting material, including the coated tools, there still remain the applications of high-speed steel cutting tools for low cutting speed machining (i. e. screw taps, reamers, broaching <b>tools,</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>tools).</b> Therefore the improving of their cutting ability {{is important to be}} researched. The paper involves the application of selected modification methods for the increasing of the tool life in operating conditions, i. e. in manufacturing of ball bearing rings from the bar raw product. Moreover, the paper introduces and evaluates the results obtained by individual methods (tool mechanical and physical modifications) finding the reasons of longer tool-lives for example by analysing the metallographic microsections of chip formation process...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: After {{investigating}} {{the operation of}} the TRT system of the blast furnace and analyzing the structure of the speedy <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> valve, the functions of the speedy <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> valve are decomposed by using the reverse fishbone diagram and function analysis. From {{the point of view of}} the system function, the problems of the speedy <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> valve are described. After the new principle solution is confirmed by effects and the function structure is improved by trimming, the solution to the problems existing in the speedy <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> valve is put forward...|$|R
