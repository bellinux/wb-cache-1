40|$|The West Coast of the South Island has a {{particular}} history distinct from other regions of New Zealand because of its physical isolation, its sparse and fragmented Maori occupation, its lack of suitability for farm settlement, and its social and economic links with Australia through nineteenth century shipping routes; many of the goldminers who first populated the region came via the Victoria goldfields and had little relationship with other South Island settlements. 	 This thesis begins with a <b>chronological</b> annotated <b>bibliography</b> of imaginative writing with the West Coast as its setting, then analyses this writing {{in terms of the}} West Coast landscape, its settlement history and its four major physical resources – pounamu, gold, coal and timber – {{and the way in which}} each has influenced the literature. It further examines the work of five West Coast writers, Jean Devanny, Peter Hooper, Keri Hulme, Jeffrey Paparoa Holman and Peter Hawes, in the context of their imaginative portrayal of the characteristics of the region. It concludes that there is a discernible perception among New Zealanders, fostered particularly by novelists and film-makers who have set their work on the Coast, that the region has iconic status and represents values and attitudes which appeal to the wider audience as distinctive. In his 1940 attempt to encourage a national literature, Monte Holcroft wrote that, “…the spirit of a country, recognisable in history and literature, is a kind of collective definition undertaken by a line of creative writers. ” New Zealand has long since developed a healthy diversity of creative literature, but it is argued in this thesis that Holcroft’s definition can now be restated in regional terms; the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand has its own spirit, is in a sense another country, and has been so defined by its creative fiction...|$|R
40|$|Since 1998 {{studies have}} shown that open access {{increases}} impact as measured by the number of citations. This <b>chronological</b> and comprehensive <b>bibliography</b> of those reports provides a way of investigating the meaning of that statement, to understand its effect, to recognise the significant factors involved, and identify the causal relationships between the respective factors. Reviews in 2010 suggest a ratio of between 5. 5 : 1 and 7 : 1 of studies showing an open access citation advantage against those that do not. The bibliography also lists the Web tools available to measure impact. It is a focused bibliography, on the relationship between impact and access. It does not attempt to cover citation impact, or other related topics such as open access, more generally, although some key papers in these areas are listed as jump-off points for wider study. Other important effects {{can be found in the}} area of research assessment. There is an occasionally updated section on the correlation between research access, impact and assessment.

40|$|ABSTRACT The closing {{moments of}} the {{brothers}} Grimm year to celebrate the 200 th anniversary of publishing the 1 st volume of Kinder- und Hausmärchen represent a perfect opportunity to honor {{the memory of the}} authors by publishing a bibliography of Slovenian translations of their fairy tales. The article gives a <b>chronological</b> <b>bibliography</b> of Slovenian monographs, articles and sound recordings that are translations or renditions of Grimm’s fairy tales. Thus, a reader enters into a 163 years period in which either collections or individual Grimm’s fairy tales were translated revealing a lot of interesting facts. The index of persons and title index at the end together with the index of original German titles help the bibliography to become a useful tool for future discoveries in the field of the folklore and fairy tales studies. </p...|$|E

It is argued that the bibliography constitutes a comprehensive resource that could strengthen and inform ongoing research in the subject field across topical issues and themes, from a religious, social science and theological perspective...|$|E
40|$|The {{figure of}} D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899 - 1981) dominates {{the history of}} British evangelicalism in the twentieth century. As perhaps the {{greatest}} non-conformist statesman of his generation, 'the Doctor' {{is best known as}} a preacher and mentor of young preachers. From the pulpit of Westminster Chapel in London and other platforms, he called the evangelical movement back to a robust reformed Christianity, with a passion for biblical conviction and Spirit-empowered revival. His impact upon evangelicalism was immense, and his legacy remains deeply influential. By building on, and engaging with, the work of earlier biographers and theologians, this valuable collection of new studies seeks to advance our understanding of Lloyd-Jones' life and legacy in a number of fresh directions. The topics covered are: the interwar Calvinist resurgence, Wales, revival, the charismatic controversy, ministerial education, fundamentalism, Barth, Rome, the Anglican secession crisis, and the Protestant past. The volume concludes with a <b>chronological</b> <b>bibliography</b> of Lloyd-Jones' writings...|$|E
40|$|Lyman Tower-Sargent, in his article"Utopian Literature in English Canada: An Annotated, <b>Chronological</b> <b>Bibliography,</b> 1852 - 1999," lists over 70 English-Canadian dystopias {{and shows}} that there exists a {{significant}} corpus of Canadian dystopian works. This thesis provides a study of two Canadian dystopias, Brown Girl in the Ring by Nalo Hopkinson and Récits de Médilhault by Anne Legault, in terms of Moylan's and Pordzik's theories, {{while at the same}} time showing how the appearance of magic within the genre is in fact serving to help these dystopian texts retain their critical power. This work first studies the evolution of the concept of dystopia as a genre, and then looks at how these two recent Canadian/Québécois dystopias further complicate and expand our understanding of the term dystopia through the incorporation of magic. Reconsidering Darko Suvin and his theories, much sited by contemporary dystopian theorists, shows the possible application of the novum and cognitive estrangement in broader terms, which would include and not exclude magic within the dystopian genre.

40|$|To {{mark the}} 30 th {{anniversary of the}} {{publication}} of the journal Migracijske i etničke teme / Migration and Ethnic Themes (up to 2000 it was issued under the title Migration Themes: a Journal for Migration and Ethic Studies), we consider it important and necessary to provide an overview in one place of the papers published in the journal from its first issue in 1985 to the last one in 2014. The most important aim of this bibliography is to introduce the scientific and professional public, especially new researchers, to the topics covered by this journal as well as to enable easier access to the journal and its more convenient use. The bibliography is selective. It includes scientific papers (the original scientific paper, preliminary communication and review paper) professional papers, conference papers, panel discussions, discussions, reviews and bibliographies, while reviews of books and periodicals (i. e. papers from the sections Books, Reviews, From Foreign Periodicals and Movie) as well as Introductions, Memories, In Memoriam and Conference Reviews (from the sections Reviews and Conferences) are not included. All the papers are available at Hrčak – Portal of Scientific Journals of Croatia. Given that all kinds of papers are not included, but primarily in order to provide its better examination and insight into published papers according to specific topics and dealing with various issues, as well as to provide easier and faster access, we have decided to make a subject bibliography, and not a chronological one. (On the occasion of the 10 th anniversary of the Migration Themes journal, the <b>chronological</b> <b>bibliography</b> prepared by Josip Kumper was published in the 3 - 4 / 1994 issue.) From the very first issue, migration and ethnicity have been the main themes represented in the journal, but the emphasis on the basic issues in previous papers, which involved external migration, internal migration, emigration and minorities/nationalities, have gradually shifted toward new phenomena and processes throughout the world such as globalization, increasing spatial mobility of people, and delocalisation and relocalisation of culture. In line with these topics, we have decided to classify the published papers into the following major thematic groups: 1. Migration, 2. Ethnicity, 3. Population, 4. Bibliographies, and 5. Other, whereby the first three groups are divided into subgroups. Taking into consideration the fact that the papers deal with various aspects of migration, ethnicity and identity, and part of them belong to two or even three basic groups at the same time, it has been impossible to assign them to only one of them. The papers whose themes are somewhat different and cannot be included in any of the mentioned groups, are classified in the group Other. The bibliography was compiled by the de visu method, that is, by checking the physical copies of the journal. Within the specific groups, the papers are listed in alphabetical order by the authors’ last names. In the case of several papers pertaining to the same author within the same subgroup, they are arranged chronologically, starting with the earliest. Each bibliographical entry contains the following information: last name, first name, title, volume, year, number and range of pages. The bibliography has an author’s index. The authors’ names in the index are linked with the number of the bibliographical entry, and are listed as they are cited in the journal so that the versions of the names or last names of the same author are placed one after the other. The papers that are classified into two or three basic groups are marked both bold and plain, with the numbers in bold denoting bibliographical records in which such papers appear for the first time and, at the same time, show the number of papers of a particular author. ...|$|E
