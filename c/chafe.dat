5|$|Bartlett {{decided to}} send a team back to {{establish}} {{the exact location of}} the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest <b>Chafe,</b> with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and <b>Chafe</b> concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. <b>Chafe</b> and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.|$|E

5|$|Two {{attempts}} were made to travel back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up extra food, but both failed, the second resulting in further losses of dogs and equipment. <b>Chafe,</b> whose feet had become gangrenous after severe frostbite, had his toes removed by second engineer Williamson, with improvised tools. McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties. They could get no nearer than , and from an examination of the distant island through binoculars could see no indications of life.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chafing</b> {{refers to}} the {{irritation}} of skin caused by repetitive friction, usually generated through skin to skin contact of multiple body parts. <b>Chafing</b> is usually contracted in the inner thighs and inner glutes; armpits and nipples can also develop <b>chafing</b> although it is less common. Severe <b>chafing</b> is known as friction burn.|$|R
5000|$|In sailing, <b>chafing</b> is {{the process}} of wear on a line or sail caused by {{constant}} rubbing against a hard, usually metallic, surface. Various methods are used to prevent <b>chafing.</b> <b>Chafing</b> of lines that rest on a choke on a boat can be prevented by putting a protecting material (sometimes as simple as a piece of old garden hose) around the line. <b>Chafing</b> of a sail rubbing against a cable can be prevented on large ships by tying around the cable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chafing</b> fuel is a fuel {{used for}} heating food, {{typically}} placed under a <b>chafing</b> dish. It is usually sold {{in a small}} canister and burned directly within that canister, {{with or without a}} wick.|$|R
5|$|Bartlett's party now {{consisted}} of eight Karluk crew members (himself, engineers John Munro and Robert Williamson, seamen Hugh Williams and Fred Maurer, fireman George Breddy, cook Robert Templeman, and <b>Chafe),</b> three scientists (McKinlay, Mamen and geologist George Malloch), John Hadley, and five Inuit (the {{family of four}} and Kataktovik). Hadley, nearing 60 years of age, {{was one of the}} few, along with Bartlett and the Inuit, with experience of travelling for distances over ice. Bartlett sent his forces out, in groups, to blaze a trail and lay down supply depots on the route to Wrangel Island, thus preparing his inexperienced party for the hazards of ice travel. When he felt they were ready for the main journey he divided them into four teams and sent the first two away on 19 February. Bartlett himself led the last two groups from the camp on 24 February, leaving a note of the party's location in a copper drum in case the camp should drift into an inhabited area. The distance to Wrangel Island was estimated at , but the journey proved to be twice that in length.|$|E

60|$|All {{the peasants}} {{have a passion}} for a high-road. They want their land opening out, opening out. They seem to hate the ancient Italian remoteness. They all {{want to be able to}} get out at a moment's notice, to get away--quick, quick. A village which is two miles off the high-road, even if it is perched like a hawk's nest on a peak, still <b>chafes</b> and <b>chafes</b> for the great road to come to it, <b>chafes</b> and <b>chafes</b> for the daily motor-bus {{connection}} with the railway.

5000|$|In a light {{form and}} heated over a spirit lamp, a <b>chafing</b> dish {{could also be}} used for cooking various dainty dishes at table - [...] of fish, cream, eggs or cheese - [...] for which silver <b>chafing</b> dishes with fine heat-insulating wooden handles were made in the late 19th century, when [...] "chafing-dish suppers" [...] became fashionable, even in {{households}} where a kitchen maid prepared all the ingredients beforehand. Specialized chafing-dish cookbooks appeared from the 1880s. A book of chafing-dish recipes printed for the silversmiths, Gorham Manufacturing Co. in New York, (2nd edition, 1894), featured a brief history of <b>chafing</b> dishes, followed by proper instruction for use, suggesting its novelty. Fannie Farmers <b>Chafing</b> Dish Possibilities was published in Boston in 1898. Modern <b>chafing</b> dishes are made of light metal or ceramic casseroles with handles, sometimes covered with a Pyrex lid. Classic uses of a chafing-dish are in preparing Welsh rarebit or cheese fondue.|$|R

25|$|Systems of evidentiality have {{received}} focused linguistic attention only relatively recently. The first major work to examine evidentiality cross-linguistically is <b>Chafe</b> & Nichols (1986). A more recent typological comparison is Aikhenvald (2004).|$|E
25|$|According to William H. <b>Chafe,</b> if {{one used}} a {{relative}} standard for measuring poverty (a standard that {{took into account}} the rising standards of living rather than an absolute dollar figure) then 18% of families were living in poverty in 1968, not 13% as officially estimated at that time.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chafing</b> {{can also}} be caused by {{improper}} or overly loose fitting clothing generating extra friction. Obesity is commonly {{thought to be the}} leading cause of thigh <b>chafing,</b> and in some cases losing body fat may help the issue, but the problem is just as noticeable in athletes with well developed quadriceps and people with tight bone structures. <b>Chafing</b> is quite prevalent among long distance athletes such as cyclists or marathon runners due to the extensive time periods during which the skin is in irritating conditions.|$|R

An athlete can easily count an average of 100 pedal strokes per minute, totaling 18,000 revolutions in three hours. Without an adequate cycling pad, continuous <b>chafing</b> can lead to rashes and perhaps even cause the skin to tear.|$|R
25|$|Unrest in {{the colony}} began to <b>chafe</b> against the aristocratic Family Compact who governed while benefiting {{economically}} from the region's resources, and who did not allow elected bodies power. This resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early Canadian nationalism. Accordingly, rebellion in favour of responsible government rose in both regions; Louis-Joseph Papineau led the Lower Canada Rebellion and William Lyon Mackenzie led the Upper Canada Rebellion.|$|E

25|$|He {{spent nine}} {{months on the}} islands, much longer than he had intended.

Half-kidnapped into staying, he became chief judge and married into the royal family of Omar I. He became embroiled in local politics and left when his strict judgments in the laissez-faire island kingdom began to <b>chafe</b> with its rulers. In the Rihla he mentions his dismay at the local women going about with no clothing above the waist, and the locals taking no notice when he complained.

500|$|In this cantata, Bach {{used the}} chorale melody {{not only in}} the opening chorale fantasia and the closing chorale, but also in the inner {{movement}}s. He built an aria theme from parts of the melody, as in movement 3, used the melody as a continuo line (movement 4), and took motifs from the melody. The musicologist Eric <b>Chafe</b> suggests that the entire cantata is also based on a [...] "design" [...] that descends tonally for the first five movements and rises again in the closing chorale, exploiting the textual theme of [...] "destruction followed by restoration".|$|E

500|$|A soprano recitative, [...] "" [...] (Alas! that {{my faith}} is yet so weak), adopts a {{modified}} version of the chorale melody as the continuo line. Gardiner notes the [...] "uncompromising" [...] way of changing the normal order: the soprano, usually singing a chorale cantus firmus (firm song) to the continuo, expresses weakness and insecurity here, marked [...] "a battuta", while the firm foundation is the chorale in the bass, to which the text of stanza three, [...] "" [...] (Therefore, I will hope in God), could be imagined. Gardiner points out a detail: the word [...] "Zeichen" [...] (sign) [...] "is given expressive, symbolic expression, a diminished seventh chord assigned to that word … formed by all three 'signs", one sharp (F-sharp), one flat (E-flat) and one natural (C). As Eric <b>Chafe</b> concludes, since St John's Gospel is known as the Book of Signs, and since the tonal plan of Bach's St John Passion appears to have been conceived as a form of play on the three musical signs (ie sharp, flat and natural key areas) this important detail in the plan of Aus tiefer Not perhaps possesses a wider significance, relating it to Bach's tonal-allegorical procedures in general.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} of Final Fantasy XIII have received mixed and positive opinions from reviewers. Ben Dutka of PSX Extreme {{said that the}} voice acting for the characters are [...] "interesting" [...] and that the cast was [...] "a competent one, even if some characters can begin to <b>chafe</b> after a while." [...] He {{also said that the}} player [...] "might grow tired of Lightning’s gruffness and Vanille’s bounciness in the early goings but they begin to show new emotions as [...] progress." [...] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish applauded the characters as [...] "the best-defined group of protagonists the series has ever seen" [...] and also praised them for their development in the story. Parish also commented that the characters [...] "worked through their differences and demons and feel like comrades" [...] during the story's development. IGN editor Ryan Clements drew a favorable comparison to the {{characters of}} Final Fantasy VI and enjoyed the characters' multi-story approach and the flashbacks in the storyline. [...] Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer said the characters were [...] "fantastic" [...] and also praised the voice acting. However, den Ouden said that in the introduction to the game, the characters [...] "lacked any kind of development for the first few hours , and the result is a confusing plotline with uninteresting characters that leaves a terrible first impression".|$|E
500|$|The ice {{surface was}} very broken up, making travel slow and difficult. At first the parties {{were able to}} travel along a track that had been marked out by the advance parties. However, recent storms had {{destroyed}} much of the trail, and in places progress was held up by breaking ice which at one point almost wrecked Bartlett's camp as his team slept. On 28 February all the parties came together {{in front of the}} first of a series of high ridges, from [...] in height, that halted their progress. These stretched east and west, blocking any route to the island. McKinlay, Hadley and <b>Chafe</b> were sent on a risky journey back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up supplies that had been left there, while the rest slowly chopped and cut a pathway through the towering ridges. When McKinlay's group returned to the main party a week later, the path forward had been advanced by only three miles (5km), but the worst of the ridges had been overcome. Hadley claimed that the ridges were worse than anything he had seen in his long years of Arctic experience. The later stages of the journey were easier, as the group travelled over steadily smoother ice, and on 12 March they reached land, a long spit of sand stretching out from the northern shores of Wrangel Island.|$|E
