Calli from the resistant and the intermediate-resistant elms exhibited growth rates and maintained viability similar to controls not exposed to culture filtrate. Stern cuttings of the susceptible lm wilted after exposure to the culture filtrate. The symptoms were similar to wilt seen with the disease. Cuttings from the resistant elm had no disease symptoms whereas, the intermediate elm had some leaf chlorosis.

The influence of the glycopeptides on the water relations of Ulmus americana seedlings was tested by placing cut stems in glycopeptide preparations. After 4 hours in 200 micrograms per milliliter toxin the stem conductance of the seedlings was reduced by 79 % and the leaf water potential was reduced by 3 bars to that at which the seedlings wilted, the stomata closed, and transpiration decreased. Decrease in stem conductance as the mode of action of the toxin was further confirmed by forcing toxin through the stem and petiole of elm and measuring the effects on stem conductance. High molecular weight dextrans were found to mimic the action of toxin on stem and petiole conductance, and their ability to do so was found to be correlated with their molecular weight. As low as 4 micrograms of toxin or dextrans were found to measurably decrease the stem and petiole conductance of elms.

40|$|Production of farnesol by Candida albicans is {{the first}} quorum- sensing system {{discovered}} in a eukaryote (29). In C. albicans, accumulated farnesol affects both dimorphism (29, 50) and biofilm formation (62). Fungal dimorphism is defined (64) as an environmentally controlled reversible interconversion of morphology, particularly yeast and mycelial morphologies. Interest in this shift derives from the dimorphic character of many fungi that are pathogenic toward plants and animals (64). Numerous chemical and environmental parameters can shift the yeast-mycelium dimorphism, including temperature, pH, glucose levels, nitrogen source, carbon dioxide levels, transition metals, chelating agents, and inoculum size or initial cell density (64). Of these, the inoculum size effect is probably the least well studied. For fungi such as <b>Ceratocystis</b> <b>ulmi</b> (28, 42) and C. albicans (29), cells develop as budding yeasts when inoculated at ≥ 106 cells per ml and as mycelia when inoculated at (Table 1). In keeping with the precedent established by homoserine lactone-based signaling in gram-negative bacteria (22), the inoculum size effect in fungi is also called quorum sensing (29) and the extracellular cell density-dependent signals are called quorumsensing molecules (QSMs). Thus, the chemical identity of the respective QSMs is of interest. Apart from C. ulmi (28) and C. albicans (29), it is a “leap of faith” on our part that the other cell density phenomena listed in Table 1 are mediated by QSMs...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{inoculum}} size effect in <b>Ceratocystis</b> <b>ulmi,</b> the dimorphic fungus that causes Dutch elm disease. In a defined glucose-proline-salts medium, cells develop as budding yeasts when inoculated at ≥ 106 spores per ml and as mycelia when inoculated at < 106 spores per ml. The inoculum size effect was not influenced by inoculum spore type, {{age of the}} spores, temperature, pH, oxygen availability, trace metals, sulfur source, phosphorous source, or the concentration of glucose or proline. Similarly, it was not influenced by added adenosine, reducing agents, methyl donors, amino sugars, fatty acids, or carbon dioxide. Instead, growing cells excreted an unknown quorum-sensing factor that caused a morphological shift from mycelia to budding yeasts. This yeast-promoting effect is abolished if it is extracted with an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate. The quorum-sensing activity acquired by the organic solvent could be added back to fresh medium in a dose-dependent fashion. The quorum-sensing activity in C. ulmi spent medium was specific for C. ulmi and {{had no effect on}} the dimorphic fungus Candida albicans or the photomorphogenic fungus Penicillium isariaeforme. In addition, farnesol, the quorum-sensing molecule produced by C. albicans, did not inhibit mycelial development of C. ulmi when present at concentrations of up to 100 μM. We conclude that the inoculum size effect is a manifestation of a quorum-sensing system that is mediated by an excreted extracellular molecule, and we suggest that quorum sensing is a general phenomenon in dimorphic fungi...|$|E
40|$|Aims: For Ophiostoma (<b>Ceratocystis)</b> <b>ulmi,</b> {{the ability}} to undergo {{morphological}} change is a crucial factor for its virulence. To {{gain an understanding of}} quorum- sensing activity in O. ulmi as it relates to yeast-mycelium dimorphism control, this study examines the effects of branched-chain amino acids as well as their fusel alcohols and fusel acids as quorum sensing molecules. Methods and Results: In a defined medium containing glucose, proline and salts, O. ulmi grew as yeasts when the culture was inoculated with a high density of spores (2 - 107 CFU ml- 1) and as mycelia when inoculated with a low spore density (4 - 105 CFU ml- 1). The cultures displaying yeast morphology secreted a quorum-sensing factor that shifted the morphology from mycelia to yeast. This quorum-sensing molecule was lipophilic and extractable by organic solvents from the spent medium. Using GC⁄MS analysis, it was determined that the major compound in the extract was 2 -methyl- 1 -butanol. A similar effect was observed when the branched-chain amino acids (fusel alcohol precursors) were used as the nitrogen source. E, E-farnesol had no effect on the morphology of O. ulmi. Conclusions: Addition of the branched-chain amino acids or one of the compounds detected in the spent medium, 2 -methyl- 1 -butanol or 4 -hydroxyphenylacetic acid, or methylvaleric acid, decreased germ tube formation by more than 50 %, thus demonstrating a quorum sensing molecule behavior in O. ulmi cultures. Significance and impact of the study: This study presents advances in the investigation of dimorphism in O. ulmi, complementing the existing scientific basis, for studying, understanding and controlling this phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Candida albicans is {{a common}} opportunistic, dimorphic human fungal pathogen. One of its {{virulence}} factors is the morphological switch between yeasts and hyphal or pseudohyphal forms, which can invade tissues and cause damage. Our studies focus on factors regulating pseudohyphae and epigenetic modifications of C. albicans. Regulating factors of pseudohyphae are aromatic alcohols and high phosphate. At low concentrations, exogenous aromatic alcohols induced pseudohyphae, as did high phosphate. For addressing the pathways involved in inducing pseudohyphae by aromatic alcohols or high phosphate, we used mutants defective in cAMP dependent PKA pathway (efg 1 /efg 1), MAP kinase pathway (cph 1 /cph 1), or both (cph 1 /cph 1 /efg 1 /efg 1). These mutants failed to produce either hyphae or pseudohyphae {{in the presence of}} aromatic alcohols; but high phosphate still stimulated pseudohyphae. Gcn 4, a transcription activator of more than 500 amino acid related genes, is turned-on in response to amino acid starvation. The accumulation of aromatic alcohols sends nitrogen starvation signals, which inhibit eIF 2 B, which in turn derepresses Gcn 4 p. High phosphate also induces pseudohyphae by derepressing Gcn 4 p, although the pathways involved are still unknown. In sum, aromatic alcohols and high phosphate induce pseudohyphae by derepressing Gcn 4. In this study we found a novel posttranslational histone modification in C. albicans, which is biotinylation. Western blot and Mass spectrometry techniques were used to find that Histones H 2 B and H 4 were biotinylated at every condition tested such as yeast vs. hyphae, aerobic growth vs. anaerobic growth, rich medium vs. defined medium. In C. albicans lysines K 8, K 11 in histone H 4 and lysines K 17, K 18, K 31 in histone H 2 B are biotin attachment sites as found using mass spectrometry. Biotin was also found to enhance the germ tube formation of C. albicans. Germ tube formation assays with biotin-starved cells as inoculum showed low percent of germ tubes (1 - 5 %). Addition of biotin to the media showed 100 % germ tubes. Biotinylation of histones were not detected from biotin-starved cells.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} parameters {{controlling the}} yeast-mycelial dimorphism in <b>Ceratocystis</b> <b>ulmi,</b> the causative agent of Dutch elm disease, have been established. The nitrogen source is critical. In a defined phosphate buffered glucose-salts liquid medium {{the presence of}} proline induces the yeast morphology whereas ammonium, arginine, or asparagine induce the mycelial state. This phenomenon is not a secondary manifestation of pH changes in the respective media {{and it can be}} achieved with either a blastospore or conidiospore inoculum. The dimorphism is, however, dependent on the inoculum size. Yeasts are only formed in the proline-containing medium, when the initial inoculum concentration is (GREATERTHEQ) 10 (2 ̆ 76) blastospores/ml. Once the blastospores produce visible buds or germ tubes they are 2 ̆ 2 committed to that mode of development, in the sense that if they are now resuspended in the medium which induces the opposite morphology, at the same cell concentration, the alternate morphology can no longer be produced. ^ The DNA synthesis in blastospores, commences concomitantly with bud initiation or germ tube initiation, and is required for development and commitment, as hydroxyurea which inhibits DNA synthesis also inhibits development. Both RNA and protein synthesis begin within one hour after inoculation. The RNA synthesis is required for development, since RNA synthesis inhibitors and the fluoro-derivatives of uracil block development. The common eukaryotic and prokaryotic protein synthesis inhibitors were without effect in C. ulmi. Paraflouro-phenylalanine blocked the morphogenesis of blastospores when added at the time of inoculation. But when added between 3 and 10 hours after inoculation, the blastospores were inhibited in proline containing medium, whereas the spores in arginine containing medium developed in the yeast phase. ^ The blastospores were resistant to cerulenin, whereas the conidiospores were sensitive to low levels of cerulenin. The cerulenin resistance in the former was correlated with lipid reserves, in the form of refractile inclusions which were absent in the latter. The cerulenin inhibition of conidiospores was reversed by saturated free fatty acids and tweens. ^ Increasing the membrane fluidity of conidiospores, in proline containing medium, by an exogeneous supply of unsaturated fatty acids in the presence of cerulenin, induces germination. Furthermore, membrane synthesis is not required for phase transition. ^ Besides dimorphism, C. ulmi exhibits a variety of morphologically distinct entities in shake cultures. In a low phosphate-glucose-ammonium-salts medium, the mycelium undergoes fragmentation in the stationary phase to yield arthrospores and chlamydospores. Chlamydospores are also formed from blastospores when ammonium chloride is added to a late log phase yeast culture. A semi-defined glucose-yeast extract medium supports the production of asexual fruiting structures called synnema. Erythromycin or inhibitory ethanol levels induce pseudohyphae in arginine-containing medium. ...|$|E
