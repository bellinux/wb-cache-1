Due to the shortage of the corresponding Itô formula, this useful method has not been popularized in stochastic partial differential equations. The aim of this work is to try to extend the Lyapunov direct method to the Itô stochastic reaction diffusion systems and to establish the corresponding Lyapunov stability theory, including stability in probablity, asymptotic stability in probability, and exponential stability in mean square. As the application of the obtained theorems, this paper addresses the stability of the Hopfield neural network and points out that the main results obtained by Holden Helge and Liao Xiaoxin et al. <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>regarded</b> as the corollaries of the theorems presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this article is}} to define the problem of vowel {{duration}} in Civili (H 12 a). It shows that the so-called Civili vowel-length desperately needs to be re-examined, because previous works on the sound system of this language hardly explain a number of phonological phenomena, such as vowel lengthening, on the basis of data at hand. Demonstrating the problem in question, the author first reviews previous works that all identify a vowel lengthening in Civili. From different analyses the complexity of the phenomenon is found out by observing differences from an analysis to another, and by regarding difficulties the different phonologists came up against. Then, the problem is also seen through the weakness of each analysis results. This eventually shows more aspects of the vowel duration issue, and leads the author to make a clear distinction between vowel length and vowel lengthening that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>regarded</b> as only vowel duration.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the global stability of solutions of an affine stochastic differential equation. The differential equation is a perturbed version of a globally stable linear autonomous equation with unique zero equilibrium where the diffusion coefficient is independent of the state. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on the rate of decay of the noise intensity for {{the solution of the}} equation to be globally asymptotically stable, stable but not asymptotically stable, and unstable, each with probability one. In the case of stable or bounded solutions, or when solutions are a. s. unstable asymptotically stable in mean square, it follows that the norm of the solution has zero liminf, by virtue of the fact that X^ 2 has zero pathwise average a. s. Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the different types of asymptotic behaviour which are more readily checked are developed.

40|$|Abstract. The {{discussion}} {{in this paper}} revolves around the notion of separation problems.

Thus, for example, the problems of classification, clustering, image seg-mentation, and discriminant analysis <b>can</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as separation problems in which one is looking for a decision boundary to be used in or-der to separate a set of data points into a number of (homogeneous) sub-sets described by different conditional densities.

On the other hand, the problems of source separation, deconvolution, and independent component analy-sis represent another subgroup of separation problems which address the task of separating algebraically mixed signals. The main idea behind the present development is to show conceptually and experimentally that both geometric and algebraic separation problems are very intimately related, since there exists a general variational approach based on which one can recover either geometrically or algebraically mixed sources, while only little needs to be modified to go from one setting to another. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The mixed variational {{formulation}} of many elliptic boundary value problems involves vector valued function spaces, like, in three dimensions, H(curl; Ω) and H(Div; Ω). Thus finite element subspaces of these function spaces are indispensable for effective finite element discretization schemes. Given a simplicial triangulation of the computational domain Ω, among others, Raviart, Thomas and Nédélec have found suitable conforming finite elements for H(Div; Ω) and H(curl; Ω). At first glance, {{it is hard}} to detect a common guiding principle behind these approaches. We take a fresh look at the construction of the finite spaces, viewing them from the angle of differential forms. This is motivated by the well-known relationships between differential forms and differential operators: div, curl and grad <b>can</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as special incarnations of the exterior derivative of a differential form. Moreover, in the realm of differential forms most concepts are basically dimension-independent. Thus, we arrive at a fairly canonical procedure to construct conforming finite element subspaces of function spaces related to differential forms. In any dimension we can give a simple characterization of the local polynomial spaces and degrees of freedom underlying the definition of the finite element spaces. With unprecedented ease we can recover the familiar H(Div; Ω) - and H(curl; Ω) -conforming finite elements, and establish the unisolvence of degrees of freedom. In addition, the use of differential forms makes it possible to establish crucial algebraic properties of the canonical interpolation operators and representation theorems in a single sweep for all kinds of spaces. 1...|$|R

This is the resource allocation paradigm considered in this thesis. Optimizing solutions to a variety of problems arising from this paradigm remains a key challenge, since these problems <b>are</b> NP-hard.

The general goal is to decide the number of facilities to open at each site and allocate the open facilities to clients so that the total cost incurred is minimized. This class of the problems extends the classical NP-hard facility location problems with additional abilities to capture various practical resource allocation scenarios. To cope with the NP-hardness of the resource allocation problems, the thesis focuses on the design and analysis of approximation algorithms.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{have studied the}} atomic {{structures}} of (111) twist boundaries and investigated {{the applicability of the}} structural unit model which has previously been established for tilt boundaries and (001) twist boundaries. The calculations were carried out using two different descriptions of interatomic forces. A pair potential for aluminium, for which the calculations were made at constant volume, and a many-body potential for gold, for which the calculations were performed at constant pressure. The atomic structures of all the boundaries studied were found to be very similar for both the descriptions of atomic interactions. This suggests that the principal features of the structure of (111) twist boundaries found in this study <b>are</b> common to <b>all</b> f. c. c. metals. At the same time it supports the conclusion that calculations employing pair potentials are fully capable of revealing the generic features of the structure of grain boundaries in metals. The results obtained here, indeed, show that structures of all the boundaries with misorientations between 0 ° and 21. 79 ° (Σ= 21) are composed of units of the ideal lattice and/or the 1 / 6 stacking fault on (111) planes, and units of the Σ= 21 boundary. Similarly, structures of boundaries with misorientations between 21. 79 ° and 27. 8 ° (Σ= 13), 27. 8 ° and 38. 21 ° (Σ= 7) and 38. 21 ° and 60 ° (Σ= 3) <b>can</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as decomposed into units of the corresponding delimiting boundaries.

Cycling is a developing mode of vacation transportation and bicycle tourism is a growing niche market in the tourism sector. It is clear that {{with the development of}} bicycle tourism, New Zealand, as the travel destination, has received many benefits, such as economic, social and environmental benefits (Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment, 2013). Many tourists engage in some sort of cycling activity while traveling around New Zealand, to explore the country and enjoy the scenic environmental surroundings. The majority of previous studies on bicycle tourism is based in European research, such as the UK and France, and only a few focus on the South Island in New Zealand. For this study, a quantitative approach was adopted to analyse the motivation of bicycle tourists in New Zealand. An anonymous questionnaire with four parts was designed to collect data then analysed to discover different motivations for bicycle tourism in New Zealand, and the convenience sampling method was used in this study. A total of one hundred and two participants were included in this research. Christmas Holiday in 2014, and Auckland Anniversary in 2015 were chosen to be the survey time for this study. The results showed that the most important ‘push’ motivation factors for bicycle tourism in New Zealand were related to adventure experiences and the great environment, while the most important ‘pull’ motivation factors for bicycle tourists <b>were</b> <b>all</b> related to safety and the trail itself.

They sustain commercial and recreational fisheries, provide flood mitigation, groundwater recharge, water supply for domestic, industrial and agricultural use, and through their natural habitat values, support a variety of wildlife. However, they have also been degraded through human modification (e. g. drained, filled-in, impounded) and catchment activities (e. g. pollution). This paradox is being addressed through a renewed commitment by the community, industry and governments to better manage these vital natural resources, such that their use is "wise" and sustainable. For example, "Waterwatch" community groups are being established throughout Australia to monitor local water quality, eco-tourism {{has become a major}} industry (e. g. the Kakadu wetlands), and both state and federal governments are developing strategies to ensure the sustainable use of wetlands. In Queensland, the government has recently released a Proposed Strategy for the Conservation and Management of Queensland's Wetlands (QDoE 1996) that will commit the state to a strategy which will: i) avoid the further loss or degradation of natural wetlands, including the biological diversity and abundance of wetland-dependent wildlife, unless overriding public interest, including necessary vector control, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> shown; ii) ensure wetland management, including appropriate wetland creation, is undertaken within the context of Integrated Catchment Management, and that use of wetlands and their products by industry and the community is ecologically sustainable; iii) develop the community awareness and appreciation of the values and benefits of wetlands, and encourage individuals to take personal responsibility for avoiding associated health risks from vectors with an aquatic stage in their lifecycle. Together with such "wise use" policies, the efforts of local government will be crucial for improved wetland management.

Even so, all too little consideration {{has been given to}} the source material that is available, especially to assess the ability of partnerships to generate company finance, whilst aspects of the demand for capital that arose from urbanisation and transport development also remains under-researched. Concentrating on textile Lancashire, this thesis researches lesser-known entrepreneurs between 1770 and 1850 from little-used primary material, studying partnerships as important suppliers of capital. This original approach demonstrates the growing importance of partnerships, particularly amongst non-family firms, exploring the sources of funding they tapped, and comparing share allocations they made. Consideration is also given to investments partnerships made in establishing related enterprises and how they coped with capital withdrawal on a partner's retirement. Investment in Lancashire's infrastructure is analysed partly in relation to the construction and improvement of turnpike roads, matters of considerable importance to manufacturers in transporting products and raw materials and which required high levels of financing. It examines the levels of finance needed for improvements, the sources from which it was drawn, and the role of businessmen in financial management of turnpike trusts. Infrastructural development is also addressed in relation to the construction of the numerous handloom weavers' cottages that were built by terminating building societies. Identifying the membership of these societies reveals that they were not self-help schemes for artisans, but rather that they offered opportunities for those with surplus income to invest in tenanted properties {{at a time when the}} skills of the handloom weaver were at a premium. This provision was vital to Lancashire's burgeoning economy, and offered subscribers an additional source of income.

That recognition came when the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act (USA) was passed in 1960 which promoted sustained management of all renewable forest resources, including the non-wood ones. Another catalyst for interest in forests as non-wood resources was the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity. These non-wood resources have been treated under different names e. g. non-wood goods and services (NWGS), non-wood benefits (Wibe 1994) that <b>can</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> synonymous to non-timber forest resources (NTFR) which is the term used in the present project. The landscape <b>can</b> <b>be</b> thought of as a hierarchically organised system (Forman and Godron 1986). In order to understand the landscape, {{and to be able to}} predict changes using this, three linkages must be known. Each landscape element is linked to the: 1) encompassing element at the next higher level; 2) nearby elements at the same scale; and 3) component elements at the next lower level. Each level in the hierarchy represents a single scale, from fine grained to coarse grained (Forman 1995). The occurrence of resources and their distributional pattern in the landscape are to a large extent scale-dependent (Turner 1989). The same <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said about processes, although processes are usually aspects of biodiversity that are less easy to observe. With processes, the time dimension should also be included since many processes occur very slowly. In order to determine the existence of processes or NTFRs, indicators are sometimes used. Indicators work as observable substitutes for the object or process of interest, the existence for which they provide evidence. Due to the described hierarchical nature of the landscape, the scale-dependency of monitoring and mapping resources, and the necessity to use indicators, there is a need to combine different data sources, i. e. field data, mapped information and when feasible remote sensing data. Usually when remote sensing data is used, it must be combined with a field sample with known geographical position. The objective of the present literature review is to provide an overview of remote sensing related methods for monitoring NTFR. Our aim is not to produce a complete review of the topic, but rather to present a sample of studies that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> regarded as good representatives of what has been achieved and reported in the scientific literature. The focus is on published studies, research and operational monitoring where remote sensing has been used for monitoring of non-timber forest resources. The whole NTFR concept is considered, in the event that we find meaningful studies, but the focus falls primarily on biodiversity monitoring. The scales used in most studies are from stand (1 ha) up to landscape (100 km by 100 km) level, and using remote sensing data sources with image elements ranging from 1 to 200 m...|$|R
