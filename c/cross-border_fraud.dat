50|$|The {{security}} breaches raised fears {{among some}} traders {{that they might}} have unknowingly purchased stolen allowances which they might later have to forfeit. The ETS experienced a previous phishing scam in 2010 which caused 13 European markets to shut down, and criminals cleared 5 million euros in another <b>cross-border</b> <b>fraud</b> in 2008 and 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Canadian and American law {{enforcement}} authorities have shown great creativity in developing and participating {{in a wide range}} of public education and prevention measures that involve <b>cross-border</b> <b>fraud.</b> For example, in Canada, the [...] "Stop Phone Fraud - It's a Trap' marketing campaign, as described above, provided public- and private-sector entities with a variety of educational materials and resources. In the United States, the National Consumers League, with a grant from the United States Department of Justice, developed a [...] "Telemarketing Fraud Education Kit" [...] for distribution to government agencies, nonprofit consumer, civic, community, and labor organizations, and schools.|$|E
40|$|The Member States of the European Union (EU) {{are missing}} billions of Euros each {{year as a}} result of <b>cross-border</b> VAT <b>fraud.</b> After its introduction, the current VAT system {{appeared}} to contain flaws and proved to be vulnerable to fraud. Tackling VAT fraud since then has become serious business within the EU. Despite the fact that there seems to come no end to new measures to combat fraud, so far though those measures seem not to be very effective. In June 2013, the European ministers again agreed on some (temporary) measures to combat fraud. Do these new measures make sense? And will they lead to an effective European approach to VAT fraud...|$|R
50|$|The {{role of the}} EPPO is to {{investigate}} and prosecute fraud against the EU budget and other crimes against the EU's financial interests including fraud concerning EU funds of over €10,000 and <b>cross-border</b> VAT <b>fraud</b> cases involving damages above €10 million. Previously only national authorities could investigate and prosecute these crimes and could not act beyond their borders. OLAF, Eurojust and Europol similarly had no ability to act. The body {{is intended to be}} decentralized, based around European Delegated Prosecutors located in each Member State. The central office will have a European Chief Prosecutor supported by 20 European Prosecutors, technical and investigatory staff. The EPPO may request a suspect's arrest, but this must be confirmed by the relevant national authority.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few weeks}} after the consent decree, three lawyers at Arnold & Porter commented on the {{disposition}} of the case on their firm's consumer-protection law blog. The FTC's investigation of BOK raises an interesting question as to whether foreign consumers will become the FTC's new Lois Lane, leaving US consumers to be the former childhood sweetheart but still close friend, Lana Lang ... While {{there is nothing in the}} FTC's mandate that requires it to exclusively protect US consumers, one could question whether this investigation was the most efficient use of the FTC's resources given that that the goods were sold into the UK market and only UK customers were targeted by the allegedly deceptive acts. The references to the Superman characters were a running gag in the post, prompted by the use of [...] "kryptonite" [...] in the defendant company's name.

40|$|From the Introduction]. This paper {{argues that}} the US Civil False Claims Act of 1986 (hereafter CFCA) could provide the European Community with a means to {{effectively}} protect the largely decentralised revenue collection and expenditure of the Community budget. It also offers {{a solution to the}} difficulty of creating an effective means of investigation and penalisation of <b>cross-border</b> <b>fraud</b> without having to create a Community criminal law or a European Public Prosecutor...|$|E

40|$|Combating {{tax evasion}} {{is part of}} the Lisbon Strategy. Tax fraud created a {{significant}} distortion in the functioning of the internal market and prevented fair competition. In its resolution of 2 th of September 2008 on a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud (2008 / 2033 (INI)) the European Parliament stressed that the Member States cannot combat <b>cross-border</b> <b>fraud</b> in isolation and called on the Commission to propose mechanisms to promote cooperation between Member States. This paper aims to analyse the main mechanisms to combat the tax evasion at the European level and, also, the changes that our country had to make in the field of legislation in order to achieve the EU standard on the fight against tax evasion...|$|E
40|$|Mr. Chairman, {{members of}} the Committee, {{thank you for the}} {{opportunity}} to testify today regarding consumer fraud and the reauthorization for the Federal Trade Commission. My name is Marc Rotenberg and I am {{the executive director of the}} Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). EPIC works with a wide range of consumer and civil liberties organizations both in the United States and around the world. I would like to begin by thanking the Committee for focusing on the issue of <b>cross-border</b> <b>fraud.</b> One of the consequences of the rapid growth of the Internet has been the dramatic expansion of both commercial opportunity online and of commercial fraud. It is clearly in the interests of businesses and consumers to ensure a stable, growing, and fair online marketplace. Fraudulent and deceptive business practices that would otherwise be prosecuted in the United States should not be beyond the reach of United States law enforcement simply because an operator sets up shop outside the country. In similar fashion, government agencies seeking to protect the interests of consumers in their jurisdictions should expect the cooperation of the Federal Trade Commission when cross-border problems emerge...|$|E
