40|$|This article {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the properties of a 27 MHz <b>current</b> <b>source</b> interstitial hyperthermia <b>system,</b> affecting temperature uniformity. Applicators can be inserted in standard flexible afterloading catheters. Maximum temperatures are measured with seven-point constantan-manganin thermocouple probes inside each applicator. Temperature can be controlled automatically using a simple control algorithm. Three-dimensional power absorption and thermal models for inhomogeneous tissues are available to optimize applicator geometry and phase configuration. Properties of the interstitial heating system have been verified both in phantom experiments and in in vivo treatments of rhabdomyosarcomas implanted in the flank of a rat. An experiment with four electrodes in one catheter proves that longitudinal control of the specific absorption rate (SAR) is feasible. Local cooling applied by cold water circulation through a catheter perpendicular to the afterloading catheter could be compensated by independent control of electrode power. Furthermore, comparison of two different phase configurations using four dual electrode applicators shows that the SAR distribution can be manipulated significantly, utilizing the phase of the electrodes. Finally, the temperature can be controlled safely and model calculations are in fair agreement with the measurements. The features of the 27 MHz <b>current</b> <b>source</b> interstitial hyperthermia <b>system</b> enable spatial temperature control at approximately 1. 5 c...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{differential}} voltage measurements {{is widely used}} in EIT instruments. Instrumentation amplifiers are always affected by common mode voltages at their input. These voltages may have different origins, being the <b>current</b> <b>sources</b> and multiplexers the ones which contribute the most. However, even considering ideal <b>current</b> <b>sources</b> and multiplexers, some amount of common mode voltage will always be present due to the measurement principle. Errors produced by common mode voltages {{are very difficult to}} calibrate because they depend on the object being measured. At low frequencies it is easy to design instrumentation amplifiers with high CMRR values, but common mode voltages are also high, mostly because of unbalances in electrode impedances. At higher frequencies common mode voltages are smaller, but the CMRR of the amplifiers also decreases. Common mode feedback (CMF) to reduce common mode voltages has been largely used in EIT systems. There is a good theoretical understanding of CMF for systems using a single <b>current</b> <b>source</b> and a demultiplexer.

40|$|AbstractThe key {{component}} in any bio-impedance measurement {{system is the}} excitation subsystem. Bio-impedance measurement can be performed by applying either current or voltage through the electrodes and then by measuring the resulting voltages or current respectively. A <b>current</b> <b>source</b> based excitation <b>system</b> can be useful for lower frequencies (i. e. up to 1 MHz). For a mammography system, many useful characteristics of the breast tissues lie above 1 MHz. The performance will degrade if a <b>current</b> <b>source</b> is used as an excitation system due to the higher output impedance and high precision requirement for an EIM system. Therefore a wideband excitation source covering higher frequencies, above 1 MHz, with an acceptable level of output impedance is required.
