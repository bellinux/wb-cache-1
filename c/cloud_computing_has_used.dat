There is virtually no prior empirical research on <b>cloud</b> <b>computing</b> in the context of accounting. Design and Methodology: the case study methodology is used, which consisted of six accounting firms.

40|$|International audienceSUMMARY <b>Cloud</b> <b>computing</b> <b>has</b> {{increasingly}} been <b>used</b> as {{a platform}} for running large business and data processing applications. Conversely, Desktop Grids have been successfully employed {{in a wide range}} of projects, because they are able to take advantage of a large number of resources provided free of charge by volunteers. A hybrid infrastructure created from the combination of Cloud and Desktop Grids infrastructures can provide a low-cost and scalable solution for Big Data analysis. Although frameworks like MapReduce have been designed to exploit commodity hardware, their ability to take advantage of a hybrid infrastructure poses significant challenges due to their large resource heterogeneity and high churn rate. In this paper is proposed BIGhybrid, a simulator for two existing classes of MapReduce runtime environments: BitDew-MapReduce designed for Desktop Grids and BlobSeer-Hadoop designed for <b>Cloud</b> <b>computing,</b> where the goal is to carry out accurate simulations of MapReduce executions in a hybrid infrastructure composed of <b>Cloud</b> <b>computing</b> and Desktop Grid resources. This work describes the principles of the simulator and describes the validation of BigHybrid with the Grid 5000 experimental platform.

40|$|As {{the recent}} advancements {{are going in}} the field of {{computer}} technologies like network devices, hardware capacities and software applications, <b>cloud</b> <b>computing</b> <b>has</b> emerged as an important paradigm that provides scalable and dynamic virtual resources to the users through the internet. Energy consumed by modern computer systems, particularly by servers in a cloud has almost reached at an unacceptable level. Also the energy consumed due to under utilization of resources accounts almost 60 % of the energy consumed at peak load. It has resulted into reduced system reliability, extremely large electricity bills and environmental concerns because of resulting carbon emission. Therefore there is a great need to optimize energy consumption. Methods like memory compression, request discrimination, task consolidation among virtual machines are developed to enhance resource utilization. Task consolidation problem has been addressed as an optimization problem in heterogeneous <b>cloud</b> <b>computing</b> environment. Task consolidation maps user service requests to appropriate resources in <b>cloud</b> <b>computing</b> environment.

40|$|<b>Cloud</b> <b>{{computing}}</b> <b>has</b> {{emerged as}} a model for hosting computing infrastructure and outsourcing management of that infrastructure. It offers the promise of simplified provisioning and management, lower costs, and access to resources that scale up and down with demand. <b>Cloud</b> <b>computing</b> <b>has</b> seen growing <b>use</b> for Web site hosting, large batch processing jobs, and similar tasks. Despite potential advantages, however, <b>cloud</b> <b>computing</b> is not much used for enterprise applications such as backup, shared file systems, and other internal systems. Many challenges need to be overcome to make cloud suitable for these applications, among them cost, performance, security, and interface mismatch. In this dissertation, I investigate how cloud infrastructure can be used for internal services in an organization, with a focus on storage applications. I show how to design systems to address the challenges of using the cloud by building two example systems. The first, Cumulus, implements file system backup to a remote cloud storage provider. With Cumulus I consider the constraints imposed by the interface to cloud storage, and how to work within those constraints to minimize the cost. The second system, BlueSky, is a shared network file server which is backed by cloud storage. BlueSky builds on ideas from Cumulus to reduce system cost. It relies on cloud storage for data durability, but provides good performance by caching data locally. I additionally study how file system maintenance tasks can be offloaded to the cloud while protecting the confidentiality and integrity of file system data. Together, these two systems demonstrate that, despite the challenges, we can bring the benefits of the cloud to enterprise storage application...|$|R
