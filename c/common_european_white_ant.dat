A new method of removing the wooden and shrub vegetation, which suffocated the life {{in and around the}} ponds of Sarkanj and Semenjača, was implemented. A mosaic of natural habitats (wet meadows-saline marshes-water [...] "mirrors") was restored. Floating plant colonies were also restored and regenerated: yellow iris, <b>common</b> duckweed, reed, <b>European</b> <b>white</b> water lily, yellow water-lily, common cattail and sedge. They soon became the nesting place for many wading birds. Some birds, absent from the area for over a century, returned. In 2017 works on revitalization of the marsh Široki Rit began, on an area of 53 ha while the Štrbac locality is scheduled to be next.|$|R

Blurb: Subterranean termites are often called 'white ants' in Australia. The <b>white</b> <b>ant</b> is a highly destructive timber pest, causing major structural timber damage to domestic and commercial buildings throughout Australia, USA, Japan and South East Asia. <b>White</b> <b>ants</b> are estimated to cause more damage to homes in Australia than fire, floods, storms and tempest combined. Recent industry surveys suggest that nearly all unprotected properties in Australia are subject to attack by <b>white</b> <b>ants.</b> <b>White</b> <b>ants</b> in Australia are known to destroy most of the wall and roof frame structural timbers of a home within 3 months of construction. Unfortunately, home insurance does 'not' cover the repair costs of damage caused by <b>white</b> <b>ant</b> infestations in homes and commercial buildings in Australia...|$|R
