500|$|... "FutureSex/LoveSound" [...] is [...] "brimming {{over with}} attitude, sharp beats and rhythm", {{according}} to Linda McGee of RTÉ.ie. The song, which {{was described as}} being [...] "suavely portentous" [...] by Pitchfork Media's Tim Finney, was cited as being a mixture between [...] "the carnal strut" [...] of Nine Inch Nails' [...] "Closer" [...] and the [...] "masochistic flutter" [...] of the Junior Boys. Finney said the song [...] "derives its charm" [...] from its [...] "lofty" [...] aspirations, [...] "like a familiar lover staging an elaborately exaggerated seduction". According to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, [...] "FutureSex/LoveSound" [...] and the other opening songs of the album are heavily influenced by David Bowie's Diamond Dogs (1974). The song sounds [...] "horny" [...] which can be seen through the lines [...] "Slide a little bit <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> little girl / Daddy’s {{on a mission to}} please." [...] The chorus of the song reminded 411mania's Mikey MiGo of Prince's [...] "New Power Generation".|$|E
500|$|Mendes had Spacey and Bening in {{mind for}} the leads from the beginning, but DreamWorks {{executives}} were unenthusiastic. The studio suggested several alternatives, including Bruce Willis, Kevin Costner, or John Travolta to play Lester, and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play Carolyn. Mendes did not want a big star [...] "weighing the film down"; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The Usual Suspects and Seven, and 1992's Glengarry Glen Ross. Spacey was surprised; he said, [...] "I usually play characters who are very quick, very manipulative and smart. [...] I usually wade in dark, sort of treacherous waters. This is a man living {{one step at a}} time, playing by his instincts. This is actually much <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> to what I am, than those other parts." [...] Mendes offered Bening the role of Carolyn without the studio's consent; although executives were upset at Mendes, by September 1998, DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Bening.|$|E
500|$|In February 1984, Genesis took a {{break in}} {{activity}} to allow each member to continue with their solo careers. Rutherford formed his group Mike + The Mechanics, Banks worked on his solo album Soundtracks, and Collins released No Jacket Required which achieved worldwide success and increased his popularity as a result. The music press took note that Collins' success as a solo artist made him more popular than Genesis. Before the release of No Jacket Required, Collins insisted {{that he would not}} leave the band. [...] "The next one to leave the band will finish it," [...] Collins told Rolling Stone magazine in May 1985. [...] "I feel happier with what we're doing now, because I feel it's <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I won't be the one." [...] Collins added, [...] "Poor old Genesis does get in the way sometimes. I still won't leave the group, but I imagine it will end by mutual consent." [...] In June, Collins spoke of the band's intention to start work on a new album that year, ending rumours to a false announcement that aired on BBC Radio 1 suggesting Genesis had split.|$|E

500|$|Momolo Mortara {{followed}} the Italian Army into Rome hoping to finally reclaim his son. According to some accounts, he {{was preceded by}} his son Riccardo, Edgardo's elder brother, who had entered the kingdom's service as an infantry officer. Riccardo Mortara fought his way to San Pietro in Vincoli and found his brother's convent room. Edgardo covered his eyes, raised his {{hand in front of}} him and shouted: [...] "Get back, Satan!" [...] When Riccardo said that he was his brother, Edgardo replied: [...] "Before you get any <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> take off that assassin's uniform." [...] Whatever the truth, what is certain is that Edgardo reacted to the capture of Rome with intense panic. He later wrote: [...] "After the Piedmontese troops entered Rome... they used their force to seize the neophyte Coen from the Collegio degli Scolopi, [...] turned toward San Pietro in Vincoli to try to kidnap me as well." [...] The Roman chief of police asked Edgardo to return to his family to appease public opinion, but he refused. He subsequently met the Italian commander, General Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora, who told him that as he was 19 years old he could do as he wished. Edgardo was smuggled out of Rome by train along with a priest on 22 October 1870, late at night and in lay clothes. He made his way north and escaped to Austria.|$|E

2500|$|Just as Lancashire's tail {{had pushed}} {{on at the}} end of their innings, so did Somerset's on the third day. Blackwell made his second century in two innings, finally {{surrendering}} on 122. The second-highest scorer was Richard Johnson with 40. Blackwell explained, [...] "I've changed a few things this year and started to bat on off stump. A lot of bowlers have been going across me because they know that I go at widish balls. The ball's now <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> if it's slanted across and I'm backing my hand-eye co-ordination to avoid being lbw." [...] The day itself was very cold, with Blackwell saying, [...] "It was absolutely perishing out there. I think play should be abandoned if it gets that cold." [...] After Somerset were dismissed for 272, six Somerset men came out to field sporting woollen hats. Bad light and rain meant the day ended at 2.07pm, with Lancashire on 33 for 1, 84 runs ahead. Whilst a Lancashire victory was not out of the question, the most likely result was the draw.|$|E

2500|$|Chamberlain deeply disliked Cheltenham, {{and felt}} lonely {{and out of}} place there. The young Chamberlain was [...] "a {{compulsive}} dreamer", {{more interested in the}} arts than in the military, and he developed a fondness for nature and a near-mystical sense of self. Chamberlain's major interests in his studies at Cheltenham were the natural sciences, especially astronomy. Chamberlain later recalled: [...] "The starlight exerted an indescribable influence on me. The stars seemed <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> more gentle, more worthy of trust, and more sympathetic – for that is the only word which describes my feelings – than any of the people around me in school. For the stars, I experienced true friendship". During his youth, Chamberlain – while not entirely rejecting at this point his liberalism – became influenced by the romantic conservative critique of the Industrial Revolution. Bemoaning the loss of [...] "Merry Old England", this view argued for a return to a highly romanticized view of a mythic, bucolic period of English history that had never existed, with the people living happily in harmony with nature on the land overseen by a benevolent, cultured elite. In this critique, the Industrial Revolution was seen as a disaster which forced people to live in dirty, overcrowded cities, doing dehumanizing work in factories while society was dominated by a philistine, greedy middle class.|$|E
