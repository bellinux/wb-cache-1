5|$|Ann Eliza Bleecker's {{pastoral}} poems exemplified a {{new style}} of American poetry, and, due to her experience of the American Revolutionary tumult, {{a new sense of}} national identity. These poems, written in the pastoral tradition, conveyed both the beauty of the colonial New York <b>countryside</b> <b>and</b> the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate depictions of the Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E
5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} <b>countryside</b> <b>and</b> more on his {{immediate}} surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to his own thoughts as he begins to emphasise what is not present in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|E
5|$|As the {{political}} winds of the Cultural Revolution shifted, Bo and his siblings were either imprisoned or {{sent to the}} <b>countryside,</b> <b>and</b> Bo Xilai was locked up for five years.

Bo Yibo was politically rehabilitated, and, in 1979, became vice premier.|$|E

5|$|As their landscapes {{have similar}} scenic qualities, AONBs may be {{compared}} to the national parks of England and Wales. AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks, the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. In contrast to national parks, which have their own authorities and legal power to prevent unsympathetic development, very few statutory duties are imposed on the local authorities within an AONB. However, further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the <b>Countryside</b> <b>and</b> Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to capture Constantinople in 717–718, the Umayyads for a time {{diverted}} their attention elsewhere, allowing the Byzantines {{to take to the}} offensive, making some gains in Armenia. From 720/721 however the Arab armies resumed their expeditions against Byzantine Anatolia, although now they were no longer aimed at conquest, but rather large-scale raids, plundering and devastating the <b>countryside</b> <b>and</b> only occasionally attacking forts or major settlements.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, an {{important}} {{year of his}} life, Escher traveled through Italy, visiting Florence, San Gimignano, Volterra, Siena, and Ravello. In the same year he traveled through Spain, visiting Madrid, Toledo, and Granada. He {{was impressed by the}} Italian <b>countryside,</b> <b>and</b> in Granada by the Moorish architecture of the fourteenth-century Alhambra. The intricate decorative designs of the Alhambra, based on geometrical symmetries featuring interlocking repetitive patterns in the coloured tiles or sculpted into the walls and ceilings, triggered his interest in the mathematics of tessellation, and became a powerful influence on his work.|$|E

5|$|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle {{has been}} {{described}} as one of Potter's most positive creations, but critics consider Lucie an artistic failure. Although Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is set in an identifiable place and time period, the tale is mythologized by reaching back to an age when household chores were performed manually and without the aid of modern mechanical inventions. The simple dwellings, rustic pathways, and stone fences enhance the tale's timeless aspect and suggest an unchanging <b>countryside</b> <b>and</b> its way of life.|$|E
