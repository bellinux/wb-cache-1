40|$|ABSTRACT The semen {{quality of}} <b>Cabot’s</b> <b>Tragopan,</b> the {{dependence}} of sperm yields on frequency of semen collection, and the duration of sperm storage in females were investigated. The results are as follows: 1) The aver-age duration of {{the period in which}} <b>Cabot’s</b> <b>Tragopan</b> can produce an ejaculate was about 70 d. The ejaculate volume ranged from 15 to 100 L. The average concentra-tion of the ejaculate was 2. 31 × 109 mL− 1. There were 11. 69 (± 0. 77) % abnormal spermatozoa per ejaculate. Three of 11 males yielded more than 50 L of semen per collection most of the time. 2) The ejaculate volumes, the concentra-tion, the total number of sperm per ejaculate, and th...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cabot's</b> <b>tragopan</b> feeds {{mostly on}} the ground, {{foraging}} for roots, shoots, buds, flowers, fruits and seeds. A favourite food is the fruit and leaves of Daphniphyllum macropodum, a small tree which is also used for roosting at night. Small invertebrates are also sometimes eaten.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the status}} of {{fragmented}} populations and predicting their fate is an increasingly important part of bird conservation. Population viability analysis (PVA) can help in this process and is widely used for assessing the extinction risk faced by threatened species and for finding the key factors affecting population status and survival prospects. From 1982 to 2004, 14 scientists studied {{the population of the}} globally threatened <b>Cabot’s</b> <b>Tragopan</b> Tragopan caboti in Wuyanling National Natural Reserve (WNNR), south-east China and collected life-history data on the population. Using VORTEX, we analysed the viability of the population in the reserve and this predicted that the population size will increase for the next 50 years and will then show a very slight decline for the next 50 years. The loss of heterozygosity is predicted to be 14 %, suggesting that the population may not be viable in the long term. Sensitivity analyses showed that nest loss is the most important factor affecting population size and the survival probability of the population, which is supported by field studies. Though the new evidence shows that <b>Cabot’s</b> <b>Tragopan</b> can build nests in spruce forest successfully, broad-leaf forest is still necessary for them for foraging, especially at some times of the year. The simulation also shows that the probability of survival {{and the size of the}} population will decrease markedly if the extent of suitable habitat is reduced even relatively slowly (such as 0. 1 % per year). Overall, we conclude that the PVA has provided very informative guidance to future management and research on <b>Cabot’s</b> <b>Tragopan</b> at Wuyanling National Nature Reserve...|$|R
25|$|The Pheasant Aviary {{is a long}} row of cages home to a large {{variety of}} bird species, {{particularly}} pheasants. Exhibited species include Elliot's pheasant, Lady Amherst's pheasant, <b>Cabot's</b> <b>tragopan,</b> blue eared-pheasant, mountain peacock-pheasant, Mérida helmeted curassow (Pauxi pauxi pauxi), Swinhoe's pheasant, eastern loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus migrans), white-throated ground-dove, Lord Derby's parakeet, Montezuma oropendola, and yellow-crested cockatoo. Across from the exhibit is a large pond for Chilean flamingos and coscoroba swans.|$|R
2500|$|Yandang Mountains are {{everywhere}} influenced by human activity; {{there is an}} extensive network of official tourist paths, clearings for fire-prevention, and unofficial paths used by the local people for collecting resources from the mountains; nevertheless, because of the steep terrain, some parts are difficult to access. Whatever wildlife survives tends to be very elusive. Notable inhabitants of Yandang Mountains include <b>Cabot's</b> <b>tragopan,</b> [...] a nationally-protected species in China. Chinese pangolin is also reported to live in Yandang Mountains.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cabot's</b> <b>tragopan</b> is {{endemic to}} {{mountain}} ranges in southeastern China {{where it is}} present in the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi and Zhejiang. Its typical habitat is subtropical evergreen forest and other forests with a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees. Its altitudinal range is 600 to 1800 m and it is also present above the treeline. Populations are fragmented as it has limited ability to disperse and seems not to move across gaps in forest cover of over 500 m.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cabot's</b> <b>tragopan</b> (Tragopan caboti) is a {{pheasant}} {{found in}} south-east China. The common and scientific names of this large bird both commemorate the ornithologist Samuel Cabot III. Other common names include the Chinese tragopan and the yellow-bellied tragopan. The population {{is divided into}} two subspecies, of which the nominate race is found in the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, and T. c. guangxiensis is confined to northeastern Guangxi and southern Hunan. The IUCN has assessed it as being a [...] "vulnerable species".|$|R
50|$|Forty-nine {{vertebrate}} {{species are}} endemic to China and three are endemic to the Wuyi Mountains. The latter are the bird David's parrotbill (Neosuthora davidiana), Pope's spiny toad (Vibrissaphora liui), and the bamboo snake Pseudoxenodon karlschmidti (family Colubridae). Other known endangered {{species in the}} area include South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), North China leopard (Panthera pardus japonensis), hairy-fronted muntjac (Muntiacus crinifrons), Sumatran serow (Capricornis sumatraensis - a goat antelope), <b>Cabot's</b> <b>tragopan</b> (Tragopan caboti), Chinese black-backed pheasant (Syrmaticus ellioti), Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus), and the golden Kaiser-i-Hind (Teinopalpus aureus - a swallowtail butterfly).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cabot's</b> <b>tragopan</b> is {{assessed}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being a [...] "vulnerable species". This is because {{it is estimated that}} there are fewer than ten thousand individuals and that the number of birds is decreasing. The main threat it faces are loss of habitat as natural forest is converted to agricultural land or plantations of conifers and bamboo. This reduces the availability of suitable nesting sites in the forks of trees, but it is hoped that the provision of artificial nesting platforms may help. The bird is present in some protected areas but these are mostly small. Illegal hunting still takes place in some areas.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{takes place}} in the spring and <b>Cabot's</b> <b>tragopan</b> has an {{elaborate}} courtship ritual. The nest is usually built off the ground in a fork in a tree and is made of grasses, mosses, feathers and leaves, but sometimes an empty nest of another bird species is used. A clutch of two to six eggs is laid and incubation is performed solely by the female. The eggs hatch in about twenty eight days and the female broods the young {{for two or three days}} after that. They then all leave the nest together, the chicks being able to fly soon after they hatch, and remain together for the winter, possibly joining with another family in a small group.|$|R
5000|$|Bordering the paddocks is a {{waterway}} running north-south {{along which}} the water bus formerly travelled, past island groups of white-faced sakis, Alaotran bamboo lemurs and howler monkeys. A variety of callitrichids, including cotton-top tamarins, were formerly housed on the Bamboo lemur Island, whilst the howler monkey and white-faced saki exhibits were formerly home to black-and-white ruffed lemurs and red ruffed lemurs. A nearby island viewable from Bats Bridge has previously held lowland anoa {{and is now}} holding Babirusia In {{the southeast corner of}} the zoo are enclosures housing an assortment of animals including bush dogs, red pandas, Southern pudu, giant anteaters, <b>Cabot's</b> <b>tragopans</b> and the wetland bird nursery. The former Cassowary exhibit next to the Anteaters will be redeveloped during 2016 for a new species ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cabot's</b> <b>tragopan</b> is a plump ground-dwelling {{bird with}} {{relatively}} short legs. The male grows to {{a length of}} about 60 cm and a weight of around 1.4 kg while the female is about 10 cm shorter and weighs around 0.9 kg. The head of the male is black with reddish-orange streaks on either side and on the neck and similar-coloured bare skin on the cheeks and around the eye. Below the beak dangle blue and orange decorative, inflatable wattles {{and there are a}} pair of fleshy blue [...] "horns" [...] over the eyes. The upper parts of the body are reddish-brown, with large buff markings and the underparts are straw-coloured. The female is altogether a less-colourful bird. The head and upper parts are reddish-brown spotted with black and marked with triangular-shaped white patches and the underparts are greyish-brown with white markings.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 A {{study of}} the phyletic {{relationships}} among five species of tragopans and an outgroup, the Blood Pheasant (Ithaginis cruentus), was conducted from 1987 to 1991. Biochemical, behavioral, and external morphologic characteristics were compared. A cladistic approach {{was used to compare}} the behavioral, biochemical, and external morphologic data collectively, as different phyletic relationships were obtained when each area of investigation was analyzed separately. Although unlike other pheasant species the genera Tragopan and Ithaginis molt their tail feathers centrifugally, study results did not indicate that these two groups were closely related. Based on a compilation of 25 characters, seven possible phylogenetic trees were generated. I rejected six of the seven trees based on current geographical distribution, morphology (size and complexity of lappet in males), behavior (wing coordination during the frontal display of male tragopans), and electrophoretic (number of unique alleles among the different species of tragopans) data. I accepted the tree that grouped Satyr and Western as closely related species and grouped Temminck's, Blyth's, and <b>Cabot's</b> <b>tragopans</b> together, with Temminck's and Cabot's being more closely related to each other than either was to Blyth's. I proposed that the prototype of tragopans probably had their origin in the eastern Himalayas. There were probably two major dispersal events; one population dispersed into central and south-east China and the Himalayas provided a corridor for the dispersal of a second population. Due to geological events in the Himalayas and China, these populations further split and eventually evolved into the extant forms...|$|R
