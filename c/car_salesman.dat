25|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} is {{the doctrine}} that prevents a party from {{acting in a}} certain way because the first party promised not to, and the second party relied on that promise and acted upon it. In English law, a promise made without consideration is generally not enforceable, and is known as a gratuitous promise. For example, a <b>car</b> <b>salesman</b> promises not to sell a car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. If however, the <b>car</b> <b>salesman</b> accepts one penny in consideration for the promise, the promise is binding and enforceable in court. Estoppel is one of the exceptions to this rule.|$|E

5000|$|The use {{of persuasion}} to achieve {{compliance}} has numerous applications in interpersonal interactions. One party can utilize persuasion techniques to elicit a preferred response from other individuals. Compliance strategies exploit psychological processes {{in order to}} prompt a desired outcome; however, they do not necessarily lead to private acceptance by the targeted individual. [...] Meaning, an individual may comply with a request without truly believing the action(s) they {{are being asked to}} complete is acceptable. Because of this, persuasion techniques are often used one-sidedly in immediate situations where one individual wishes to provoke a specific response from another individual. For example, <b>car</b> <b>salesmen</b> frequently use the lowball technique to manipulate customers' psychological functioning by convincing them to comply with a request. By initially estimating a car's price to be lower than actuality, <b>car</b> <b>salesmen</b> recognize that the customer is more likely to accept a higher price at a later time. Compliance strategies (i.e., lowball, foot-in-the-door, etc.) are relevant to numerous person-to-person interactions when persuasion is involved. [...] One individual can use such techniques to gain compliance from the other, swayed person. Other practical examples include: ...|$|R
