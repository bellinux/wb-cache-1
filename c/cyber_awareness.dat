40|$|Abstract: Technological {{advances}} {{have changed the}} manner in which ordinary citizens conduct their daily activities. Many of these activities are carried out over the Internet. These include filling tax returns, online banking, job searching and general socialising. Increased bandwidth and proliferation of mobile phones with access to Internet in South Africa imply increased access to Internet by the South African population. Such massive increased in access to Internet increases vulnerabilities to cyber crime and attacks and threatens the national security. As a result, South Africa remains one of top three countries that are targeted by phishing attacks, the other two are the US and the UK (RSA, 2011). As a response, various entities engage in <b>cyber</b> security <b>awareness</b> initiatives and trainings with the aim to create <b>cyber</b> security <b>awareness</b> (CSA) among the citizens of South Africa. In the absence of a national cyber security policy, however, these awareness initiatives and programmes are delivered through a variety of independent mechanisms. Various entities engage in <b>cyber</b> security <b>awareness</b> training each with its specific objectives and focus areas. It is argued in this paper that cyber security is complex and multi-faceted. No single solution can effectively address it. While the current means to create <b>cyber</b> security <b>awareness</b> does make impact, the fragmented and uncoordinated nature thereof have a potential to create its own dynamics. The focus of organisations to deliver on their own objectives translates to some extent into the optimisation of the behaviour of individual entities as opposed to the optimisation of the national <b>cyber</b> security <b>awareness</b> as a whole. This paper evaluates {{the extent to which the}} current <b>cyber</b> security <b>awareness</b> initiatives address the cyber security threats and risks. The assessment is based on the initiatives objectives, alignment of the programme to the cyber threats, and the target audience...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Cyber {{security}} is a GLOBAL issue. The {{rest of the world}} needs Africa to be aware and ready. Furthermore, Africa can only be aware and ready if it is internally organised and collaborates effectively {{with the rest of the}} world. The African continent consists mostly of developing countries where the needs for <b>cyber</b> security <b>awareness</b> programmes are different from developed countries. Therefore, it makes perfect sense for the continent to cooperate with respect to cyber security joint initiatives and by sharing best practice and skilled resources for <b>cyber</b> security <b>awareness</b> and response. There is currently no continental coordination of cyber security. This paper proposes a high-level African Cyber Security Policy as well as an African <b>Cyber</b> Security <b>Awareness</b> Framework to guide cyber security agencies, standards and legislation as well as specific initiatives to promote <b>cyber</b> security <b>awareness.</b> This is achieved through the analysis of a few Cyber Security Policies from developed countries (USA, UK, Estonia, Korea), identification of African countries that have such policies in place, and identification of the agencies, forums, workgroups, conferences, organisations and other initiatives that are currently dealing with ICT and cyber security policy and awareness in Africa – including ITU, Interpol, AfriNIC, ISG-Africa and country-specific organisations such a...|$|R

The NATO Modelling and Simulation Group is looking for ways to leverage Modelling and Simulation experience in research, analysis and training to assist the Cyber Defence capability. The remit of NATO Modelling and Simulation Group 117 (MSG- 117) ‘Exploiting Modelling and Simulation in support of Cyber Defence’ is to investigate and recommend those aspects of Cyber Defence that could be supported with Modelling and Simulation. To ensure as broad perspective as possible, Task Group members have been drawn from both the modelling and simulation and cyber communities. The Task Group has selected five topic areas for the work: Decision Support System; Cyber Computer Assisted Exercises (CAX) and training programs; <b>Cyber</b> <b>awareness</b> and education; a common set of definitions for Cyber Defence M&S exploitation; M&S environments, synthetic environments, standards, and processes. This paper will focus on the use of Modelling and Simulation in support of decision support, and training and education. First we will address the challenges that M&S faces in supporting these areas.

40|$|Cyberspace is {{everywhere}} in the world nowadays – all our activities are connected to the internet, devices are connected to each other and at least part of our life takes place online. Although it makes daily life easier and faster most of the time, sometimes people do not apply the level of protection in the online sphere, as they do offline. Crime takes place no matter the space, and the digital sphere has enabled a new world where crime is becoming even more common due to the easy access and anonymity. Cybercrime does not have geographical boundaries or time restrictions; instead, it is becoming easier to commit fraud online. <b>Cyber</b> <b>awareness</b> among people, such as knowledge about existing threats and their prevention in the online world is often considered the weakest link in the chain of committing a crime. Whether or not cybercrime has a direct threat on or even a connection to human security has not been discussed much. Human security in relation to cyberspace is shifting away from physical threats and towards psychological harm. This paper will search for the relationship between human security and cybersecurity through a deeper research on the subject of cyberspace and the threats that it poses to internet users. It will also analyse the level of awareness of potential cyber threats among internet users using the empirical data taken from an online survey of 220 participants and through the human security concept to explore the level of disruptions created by different threats...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{development}} has been observed in the deployment of communication technologies {{and the use of}} the Internet across the globe. Information exchange is the main aspect of use of such technologies in everyday life. Crimes associated with the misuse of information on the Internet are on the increase and are resulting in various losses. Saudi Arabia is one of the fastest developing countries in the Middle East, where the uptake of communication technologies such as the Internet and mobile technologies has risen sharply in recent years. These technologies are relatively new to the region when compared to developed countries. Therefore, the crimes associated with these technologies may be new to the people in the region. This paper investigates the <b>cyber</b> security <b>awareness</b> of the people in Saudi Arabia within different contexts. A quantitative online based survey was conducted to gather information related to <b>cyber</b> security <b>awareness</b> in Saudi Arabia. The study found that, although the participants had a good knowledge of IT, their awareness of the threats associated with cybercrime, cyber security practices, and the role of government and organisations in ensuring information safety across the Internet, is very limited. An application based model to create <b>cyber</b> security <b>awareness</b> in the region was preferred by the majority. The results indicated that, although cybercrime is on the rise, no specific approach is being followed to increase <b>cyber</b> security <b>awareness</b> in the region except for CERT regulations and online information on government websites. Additionally, Chi-Square test results (t(627) = 3. 85, p= 0. 013) indicated that Internet skills have an effect on cyber security practices from the users 2 ̆ 7 end and there is an association between skill level and the security measures being implemented by organisations in the region.

50|$|Information {{security}} awareness {{is one of}} several key principles of information security. Information {{security awareness}} seeks to understand and enhance human risk behaviors, beliefs and perceptions about information and information security while also understanding and enhancing organizational culture as a countermeasure to rapidly evolving threats.

40|$|Abstract — A {{large portion}} of the South African rural {{community}} only have intermittent access to computers and are not familiar, nor entirely comfortable, with the use of internet communication or electronic devices. The research conducted by the authors of this paper confirms that this lack of awareness, combined with the inherent dangers posed by the internet, expose local communities to cyber threats.

It has, to a large extent, had {{a positive effect on}} the way people communicate. It has also introduced new avenues for business and has offered nations an opportunity to govern online. Nevertheless, although cyberspace offers an endless list of services and opportunities, it is also accompanied by many risks. One of these risks is cybercrime. The Internet has given criminals a platform on which to grow and proliferate. As a result of the abstract nature of the Internet, it is easy for these criminals to go unpunished. Moreover, many who use the Internet are not aware of such threats; therefore they may themselves be at risk, together with businesses and governmental assets and infrastructure.

40|$|Abstract—The <b>cyber</b> {{situational}} <b>awareness</b> of {{an organization}} determines its effectiveness in responding to attacks. Mission success is highly dependent on the availability and correct operation of complex computer networks, which are vulnerable to various types of attacks. Today, situational awareness capabilities are limited in many ways, such as inaccurate and incomplete vulnerability analysis, failure to adapt to evolving networks and attacks, inability to transform raw data into cyber intelligence, and inability for handling uncertainty. We describe advanced capabilities for mission-centric <b>cyber</b> situational <b>awareness,</b> based on defense in depth, provided by the Cauldron tool. Cauldron automatically maps all paths of vulnerability through networks, by correlating, aggregating, normalizing, and fusing data {{from a variety of}} sources.
