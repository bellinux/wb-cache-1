In this regard, the Senior Advisory Group explains that “the international community has had less success in supporting and enabling the national capacities that are essential or an enduring peace.” It further contends that the United Nations’ inability to “transfer skills and knowledge to national actors…has increased the risk of relapse into conflict.” ...|$|E

The IHR aims to prevent, protect against, control, {{and respond to the}} international spread of disease and aims to cut out unnecessary interruptions to traffic and trade. To meet IHR requirements, countries need to improve capacity construction by developing, strengthening, and maintaining <b>core</b> response <b>capacities</b> for public health risk and Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). In addition, all the related <b>core</b> <b>capacity</b> requirements should be met before June 15, 2012. If not, then the deadline can be extended until 2016 upon request by countries.

In recognition of this fact, national Health Regulations in 2005 (IHR 2005) that took effect in 2007. The purpose of IHR 2005 is to en-hance global cooperation and protect populations from emerging health threats [2] by requiring participating countries to “develop <b>core</b> <b>capacities</b> for surveillance, detection, reporting and response. ” These <b>core</b> <b>capacities</b> include legislation and financing, national and international communication, preparedness, human resources, and laboratory resources.

40|$|Contrary to {{the common}} belief that more {{information}} is always better, Gigerenzer et al.

40|$|Although the {{development}} of moral competence of children is often seen as a family matter, schools {{have a major impact}} on the moral development of their students and should therefore see it as their task to nurture this. In this thesis different methods and approaches to moral education of both regular and democratic schools are compared. To this end, first a common sense and theory neutral conception of moral agency is offered and three essential <b>core</b> <b>capacities</b> for moral agency are stated, being the ability to engage in critical discussion, to sympathise, and to act for the right reasons cross-situationally. Subsequently, a summary of both school systems is provided (chapter two), followed by an analysis of how certain methods for moral education, implemented in the unique framework of each school system, could suitably enhance these three <b>core</b> <b>capacities</b> of moral agency (chapter three). While both school systems use modelling, verbal instruction, and rules and reinforcements as ways to influence the moral development of their students, democratic school’s vision on education (the role of teachers; the physical, formal and informal environment it offers; etc.) offers extra valuable support for the realisation of capacities of moral agency. Although the traditional mainstream school system has the possibility to provide all students with the same moral education, it does fall short on many aspects. But while democratic schools prioritise the moral education of their students to a greater extent, they are not able to secure {{the development}} of all three <b>core</b> <b>capacities</b> in all their students either. I will conclude by recommending small changes that each school system could implement to enhance the moral development of their students, leaving their own vision on which framework is desirable for education in general intact...|$|E
40|$|Background: As {{designated}} {{points of}} entry (PoEs) {{play a critical}} role in preventing the transmission of international public health risks, huge efforts have been invested in Taiwan to improve the <b>core</b> <b>capacities</b> specified in the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR 2005). This article reviews how Taiwan strengthened the <b>core</b> <b>capacities</b> at the Taoyuan International Airport (TIA) and the Port of Kaohsiung (PoK) by applying a new, practicable model. Design: An IHR PoE program was initiated for implementing the IHR <b>core</b> <b>capacities</b> at designated PoEs. The main methods of this program were 1) identifying the designated PoEs according to the pre-determined criteria, 2) identifying the competent authority for each health measure, 3) building a close collaborative relationship between stakeholders from the central and PoE level, 4) designing three stages of systematic assessment using the assessment tool published by the World Health Organization (WHO), and 5) undertaking action plans targeting the gaps identified by the assessments. Results: Results of the self-assessment, preliminary external assessment, and follow-up external assessment revealed a continuous progressive trend at the TIA (86, 91, and 100 %, respectively), and at the PoK (77, 97, and 99. 9 %, respectively). The results of the follow-up external assessment indicated that both these designated PoEs already conformed to the IHR requirements. These achievements were highly associated with strong collaboration, continuous empowerment, efficient resource integration, and sustained commitments. Conclusions: Considering that many countries had requested for an extension on the deadline to fulfill the IHR 2005 core capacity requirements, Taiwan's experiences can be a source of learning for countries striving to fully implement these requirements. Further, in order to broaden the scope of public health protection into promoting global security, Taiwan will keep its commitments on multisectoral cooperation, human resource capacity building, and maintaining routine and emergency capacities...|$|E
