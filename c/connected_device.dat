5|$|When ReactOS {{was awarded}} as Project of the Month on SourceForge on June 2013, a {{crowdfunding}} campaign on Kickstarter {{was announced in}} an interview with the project's coordinator, Aleksey Bragin. On 23 December 2013 the announced project was revealed as a Kickstarter campaign with the goal of US$120,000 was started. The Thorium Core Cloud Desktop dubbed cloud computing service would use ReactOS as core and could allow the use of Windows compatible applications from mobile devices (like smartphones, tablets), workstations, or any other <b>connected</b> <b>device.</b> On 21 February 2014, fundraising ended short of the target amount, with $48,965 of $120,000 raised, resulting in no transferred money.|$|E

25|$|The Foundation Profile is a Java ME <b>Connected</b> <b>Device</b> Configuration (CDC) profile. This {{profile is}} {{intended}} to be used by devices requiring a complete implementation of the Java virtual machine up to and including the entire Java Platform, Standard Edition API. Typical implementations will use some subset of that API set depending on the additional profiles supported. This specification was developed under the Java Community Process.|$|E
25|$|Java ME devices {{implement}} a profile. The most common {{of these are}} the Mobile Information Device Profile aimed at mobile devices, such as cell phones, and the Personal Profile aimed at consumer products and embedded devices like set-top boxes and PDAs. Profiles are subsets of configurations, {{of which there are}} currently two: the Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) and the <b>Connected</b> <b>Device</b> Configuration (CDC).|$|E

2500|$|Many USB decorations {{do not use}} the {{communications}} features of the USB bus, or fully comply with USB standard power discipline. This can interfere with the purposes for which the USB bus was designed, especially if the device suddenly attempts to draw the full 500mA of power nominally available. [...] The default power consumption is only 100mA, which should not impact the computer's PSU if a device is suddenly connected without identifying itself first. [...] A newly <b>connected</b> <b>device</b> is supposed to then use the USB protocol to communicate a request for more DC power, if needed.|$|E
2500|$|Google Cloud Print is a Google {{service that}} helps any {{application}} on any device to print on any printer. While the cloud provides virtually any <b>connected</b> <b>device</b> with information access, {{the task of}} [...] "developing and maintaining print subsystems for every combination of hardware and operating system—from desktops to netbooks to mobile devices—simply isn't feasible." [...] The cloud service requires installation {{of a piece of}} software called proxy, as part of the Chrome OS. The proxy registers the printer with the service, manages the print jobs, provides the printer driver functionality, and gives status alerts for each job.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} and activists {{argue that the}} IoT {{can be used to}} create new models of civic engagement if device networks can be open to user control and inter-operable platforms. Philip N. Howard, a professor and author, writes that political life in both democracies and authoritarian regimes will be shaped by the way the IoT will be used for civic engagement. For that to happen, he argues that any <b>connected</b> <b>device</b> should be able to divulge a list of the [...] "ultimate beneficiaries" [...] of its sensor data and that individual citizens should be able to add new organizations to the beneficiary list. In addition, he argues that civil society groups need to start developing their IoT strategy for making use of data and engaging with the public.|$|E

40|$|Differences in {{the thermal}} and {{electrical}} switching time constants between parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices</b> cause imbalances {{in the power}} and temperature distribution thereby reducing module robustness. In this paper, the impact of electro-thermal variations (gate and thermal resistance) between parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices</b> on module robustness is investigated for 900 V-CoolMOS and 1. 2 kV-SiC MOSFETs under clamped inductive switching (CIS) and unclamped inductive switching (UIS). Under CIS, {{the difference in the}} steady-state junction temperature (ΔTJ) and switching energy (ΔESW) between the parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices</b> for a given difference in the gate and thermal resistance (ΔRG & ΔRTH) is used as the metric for determining robustness to electrothermal variations i. e. how well the devices maintain uniform temperature in-spite of switching with different rates and thermal resistances. Under UIS conditions, the change in the maximum avalanche current/energy prior to device failure {{as a function of the}} ΔTJ and ΔRG between the parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices</b> is used as the metric. Under both CIS and UIS, SiC devices show better performance with minimal negative response to electrothermal variations between the parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices.</b> Finite element models have also been performed showing the dynamics of BJT latch-up during UIS for the different technologies...|$|R
