Despite her opposition to giving African American men {{the right to}} vote without enfranchising all women and the derogatory language she had resorted to in expressing this opposition, Stanton had no objection to interracial marriage and wrote a <b>congratulatory</b> <b>letter</b> to Frederick Douglass upon his marriage to Helen Pitts, a white woman, in 1884. Anthony, fearing public condemnation of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and wanting to keep the demand for female suffrage foremost, pleaded with Stanton not to make her letter to Douglass or support for his marriage publicly known.|$|E

He accepted, and although defeated, fought a strong campaign which won him a <b>congratulatory</b> <b>letter</b> from William Gladstone. His business affairs were proceeding less serenely; he quarrelled with his partner Douglas MacRae, and the two decided to separate. Bottomley described the [...] "Quixotic impulse" [...] that led him to let MacRae divide the assets: [...] "He was a printer, and I was a journalist—but he took the papers and left me the printing works".|$|E

[...] Among the host of her admirers few had given the popular Savoy soubrette credit for such great ability as a genuine comedy-actress, for never before had the opportunity been afforded her to display her latent talent—Jessie Bond's triumph came as a surprise to all.... So true to real life was the portrayal of Mad Margaret that Mr. Forbes Winslow, the famous authority on mental disorders, wrote a <b>congratulatory</b> <b>letter</b> to Miss Bond and inquired where she had found the model from which she had studied, and so faithfully copied the phases of insanity. No greater compliment could have been paid the actress.|$|E

As {{a result of}} his unit participating in hazardous duty, it received a <b>congratulatory</b> <b>letter</b> for bravery from General John J. Pershing, and Bell was promoted to first sergeant. After the war, Bell returned to the United States in March 1919. He returned to Penn as captain of the team in the fall and again performed erratically. The Quakers finished 1919 with a 6–2–1 record. Academically, his aversion to attending classes forced him to withdraw from Penn without a degree in early 1920. His collegiate days ended with his having been a borderline All-American, but this period of his life had proven that he [...] "possessed the qualities of a leader." ...|$|E
500|$|Recognition came late to Delius; before 1899, when he {{was already}} 37, his works were largely {{unpublished}} and unknown to the public. When the symphonic poem Paa Vidderne was performed at Monte Carlo on 25 February 1894 in a programme of works from British composers, The Musical Times listed the composers as [...] "...Balfe, Mackenzie, Oakeley, Sullivan... and one Delius, whoever he may be". The work was well received in Monte Carlo, and brought the composer a <b>congratulatory</b> <b>letter</b> from Princess Alice of Monaco, but this {{did not lead to}} demands for further performances of this or other Delius works. Some of his individual songs (he wrote more than 60) were occasionally included in vocal recitals; referring to [...] "the strange songs of Fritz Delius", The Times critic expressed regret [...] "that the powers the composer undoubtedly possesses should not be turned to better account or undergo proper development at the hands of some musician competent to train them".|$|E

500|$|In November 1970, {{the cover}} of Time {{magazine}} featured Big Bird, who had received more fan mail {{than any of the}} show's human hosts. The magazine declared, [...] "...It is not only the best children's show in TV history, {{it is one of the}} best parents' shows as well".

[...] Other reviewers predicted commercial television would be forced to improve its children's programming, something that did not substantially occur until the 1990s. [...] Sesame Street won a Peabody Award, three Emmys, and the Prix Jeunesse award in 1970.

500|$|Arismendi {{proposed}} to MacGregor that capturing {{one of the}} ports in East or West Florida, which were then Spanish colonies, might provide an excellent springboard for republican operations elsewhere in Latin America. MacGregor liked the idea and, after an abortive attempt to recruit in Haiti, sailed with Josefa to the United States to raise money and volunteers. Soon after he left in early 1817, a further <b>congratulatory</b> <b>letter</b> arrived in Margarita from Bolívar, promoting MacGregor to divisional general, awarding him the Orden de los Libertadores (Order of the Liberators), and asking {{him to return to}} Venezuela. MacGregor remained ignorant of this for two years. On 31 March 1817 in Philadelphia, MacGregor received a document from Lino de Clemente, Pedro Gual, and Martin Thompson, each of whom claimed to speak for {{one or more of the}} Latin American republics. They called themselves the [...] "deputies of free America" [...] and [...] called upon MacGregor to take possession of [...] "both the Floridas, East and West" [...] as soon as possible. Florida's proposed fate was not specified; MacGregor presumed that the Floridians would seek US annexation, as they were mostly of non-Spanish origin, and that the US would quickly comply. He thus expected at least covert support from the US government.|$|E

Much to her surprise and disappointment, however, the award has actually gone to Ron (Nick Offerman) in recognition of town projects Leslie primarily developed. Ron secretly acknowledges the award as a ridiculous mistake. However, he uses the mistake as an opportunity to tease Leslie before later recommending her as the award recipient. Ron constantly brags about the award, even commissioning a professional photographer to take his official portrait for the award ceremony. Eventually, Ron admits he is joking and attempts to recommend Leslie for the award. However, the IOW director (Maribeth Monroe) reveals that a man was strategically chosen for the first time for marketing purposes. Frustrated with the politics of the awards, Leslie and Ron plan for him to make a disparaging acceptance speech condemning the awards. However, at the ceremony itself, Ron instead publicly presents the award to Leslie, to the frustration of the IOW director and members. The next day's newspaper proclaims Ron the winner, with Leslie and Ron later deciding that the award is meaningless, anyway. The plaque is thrown into a wastebasket, where Leslie later secretly retrieves it.|$|E

500|$|Waugh joined Hertford College on a scholarship, in January 1922. He had {{received}} a <b>congratulatory</b> <b>letter</b> from Cruttwell welcoming him to the college and complimenting him on his English prose: [...] "about the best {{of any of the}} Candidates in the group". Despite this warmth, Waugh's initial impressions of his tutor were unfavourable—"not at all the kind of don for whom I had been prepared by stories of Jowett." [...] The first recorded clash between them came early in Waugh's first term; {{in a letter to his}} school friend Dudley Carew, Waugh reports that his tutor verbally abused him for a Latin mistranslation with the words [...] "Damn you, you're a scholar!" [...] The main basis for the rift that rapidly developed was Waugh's increasingly casual attitude towards his scholarship. Whereas Cruttwell saw the scholarship as a commitment to hard and devoted study, Waugh considered it a reward for his successful school studies and a passport to a life of pleasure. To the detriment of his work, Waugh involved himself in a range of university activities: the Oxford Union, the Hertford debating society, journalism and drawings for the undergraduate papers Isis and Cherwell, and a hectic social life. In his third term, he was brusquely advised by Cruttwell that he should take his studies more seriously, a warning which Waugh chose to interpret as an insult. [...] "I think it was from then on that our mutual dislike became incurable", he later wrote.|$|E
