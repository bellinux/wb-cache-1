40|$|Organic beef {{production}} in Europe {{is based on}} grazing in the summertime and feeding of minimum 60 % of roughage during the whole year. Although these recommendations were intended to improve health and welfare several aspects may cause problems in organic beef production systems. This paper gives an overview of welfare, health and product quality in organic beef production with emphasis on organic steer production based on dairy breed bull calves. A short overview of different production systems is given with emphasis on the effect on health, and welfare. Feeding aspects are discussed. Farm {{studies have shown that}} organic steer production is based on high amounts of roughages, and only small amounts of cereals are used compared to a conventional production of bulls and calves. Fattening of organic steers may result in metabolic disorders due to sudden changes in the feed ration when changing from high roughage to high <b>cereal</b> <b>content.</b> The various problems related to the production system are discussed. Farm studies indicate a good general health and welfare in organic steer production system based on subjective monthly observations. On pasture, parasite infections may be the primary factor affections health and productivity in organic beef production. Rearing of the young calves and utilization of marginal grazing areas are two major fields, which requires further attention. The effect of castration on health and welfare and the effect of castration age and method are discussed. Product quality of organic beef is affected by the production system, especially sex, grazing and exercise. Grazing and exercise that are inevitable components of the organic beef production system may affect the eating quality of organic beef due to darker meat color, risk of off-flavor, yellow fat, and a higher content of unsaturated fatty acids including CLA. The general effect on sensory attributes might be of minor importance. Feeding high amounts of roughage with contents of bioactive forages {{may be one of the}} means of improving product quality in the future...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains four essays at {{the intersection}} of econometrics and industrial organization. In all my chapters, I rely on a detailed set of supermarket scanner data on ready-to-eat cereals. In Chapter 1, I examine identification of price effects for differentiated product markets by relying on a conditional form of exogeneity that is an alternative framework to standard instrumental variables. I simulate price changes in the cereal industry arising from potential mergers between firms, one of which took place in 2008. In Chapter 2, I continue to employ conditional exogeneity to identify the effect of market price on demand for differentiated products. The analysis here departs from past studies of demand in several ways, including relaxing the prevalent assumption that observed product characteristics are exogenous. Estimates of implied price-cost margins based on the conditional exogeneity framework are far more reasonable and stable compared to estimates based on standard instrumental variables procedures. In Chapter 3, we (coauthored with Xun Lu) relax the omnipresent assumption that indirect utility takes a linear-separable parametric form in standard logit models of demand. We rely on conditional independence to structurally identify and nonparametrically estimate the average marginal effect of market price on consumer demand. We find that the effect of price on demand is monotonically increasing in price, resulting in high-priced goods having less elastic own price elasticities, and thus higher implied price-cost margins, which addresses a well-known concern in empirical industrial organization. In Chapter 4, I examine a firm's decision to raise price overtly (by increasing the dollar amount of a good) versus a hidden price change (by decreasing the contents in a good's package). I conduct a comprehensive set of empirical analyses in order {{to assess the impact of}} hidden price increases on expenditure share and profitability. During July 2007, General Mills decreased the <b>cereal</b> <b>content</b> for 20 out of 23 of their products in my sample of scanner data.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contains two}} essays in industrial organization and one {{related to the}} corporate finance literature. In Chapter 1, I investigate how consumers' feedback might affect investments in innovation and quality assurance (QA). I also focus on how innovation impacts intertemporal price discrimination. In the model, a monopolist releases a new technology embedded in a durable good. Then, I investigate the determinants of {{the introduction of a}} new generation in the second period. In the proposed framework consumers' feedback can reduce the firm's QA/R&D expenses. However, consumers usually provide feedback through complaints, causing reputation damage. I derive conditions under which the lower "quality" version of the good (first generation) will have a higher price than the improved version (second generation). Planned obsolescence causes the price schedule to be steeper than predicted by the previous literature on durable goods. The model predicts and explains Apple's experience with several products, in particular the iPhone family. In Chapter 2, Aren Megerdichian and I examine a firm's decision to raise price overtly (by increasing the dollar amount of a good) versus the adoption of hidden price change (by decreasing the contents in a good's package). We provide an oligopoly model explaining the hidden price change phenomenon, as well as a comprehensive set of empirical analyses, including demand estimation {{to assess the impact of}} hidden price increases on expenditure share and profitability. We focus on the ready-to-eat cereal industry. During July 2007, General Mills decreased the <b>cereal</b> <b>content</b> for 20 out of 23 of their products in our sample of scanner data. We find that some General Mills products gained expenditure share after the hidden price change relative to what the demand system predicts, indicating that a sufficient proportion of consumers did not notice the hidden price change. We also find that some products lost share relative to what the demand system predicts. A key finding is that consumers tend to notice hidden price changes on smaller-sized boxes of cereal, leading them to substitute to larger-sized boxes of cereal. The final chapter is a joint work with Regio Martins. Our conjecture is that regulated firms may be subject to some regulatory practices that can potentially affect the symmetry of the distribution of their future profits. If these practices are anticipated by investors in the stock market, the pattern of asymmetry in the empirical distribution of stock returns may differ among regulated and non-regulated companies. We review recently proposed asymmetry measures that are robust to the empirical features of return data and investigate whether there are any meaningful differences in the distribution of asymmetry between these two groups of companie...|$|E

40|$|This review {{describes}} {{the pattern of}} intramuscular fat accretion in cattle {{and the potential for}} its manipulation during both the pasture (or backgrounding) and intensive grain-finishing phases of development. A growth curve for the development of marbling in British and Japanese Black type breeds is discussed with the conclusion that 3 phases of development exist: (i) a period of growth up to ∼ 200 kg hot carcass weight where intramuscular fat does not increase; (ii) a period of linear development as carcass weight increases from 200 to 450 kg; and (iii) the attainment of mature body size (∼ 500 kg carcass weight depending on genotype) at which intramuscular fat content appears to reachea maximum. Data are also presented to show that the intramuscular and other fat depots develop at similar rates indicating that intramuscular fat is not a late maturing depot. Pre-finishing growth checks reduce the initial intramuscular fat at the start of finishing and this is translated into lower levels at the end of finishing. It is argued that the greatest potential for the manipulation of intramuscular fat accretion during fattening is via an increase in the net energy of the ration. Increasing net energy can be achieved by increasing the <b>cereal</b> grain <b>content</b> of the diet (grain v. grass); by feeding processed cereal grain, which allows both maximal rumen fermentation and small intestinal digestion of starch, and by increasing the lipid content of the diet. In addition it is proposed that the substrate supply or hormonal milieu can also be optimised, along with the availability of net energy to maximise fat accretion. The role of lipolysis (fat turnover) as a regulator of fat accretion is also discussed...|$|R

Sires were selected from Merino, maternal and terminal meat breeds; while the dams consisted of ∼ 80 % pure Merino and 20 % crossbred (Border Leicester × Merino) types. Lambs were generally maintained under extensive pasture conditions, but were fed grain, hay or feedlot pellets when the pasture supply was limited. Lambs were slaughtered over 3 consecutive years (2008 - 10), with 28 - 30 slaughter days per year. At 24 h post-mortem, 20 -g muscle samples (longissimus lumborum: LL) were taken for fatty acid determination. Lambs from Hamilton, Katanning and Kirby had a higher (P < 0. 001) concentration of major saturated (palmitic and stearic) and oleic acids in meat that is proposed {{to be associated with}} those lambs being fed diets higher in <b>cereal</b> grain <b>content.</b> Saturated fatty acids, except lauric acid, were lower (P < 0. 02) in lambs sired by Merino or terminal type than lambs sired by maternal type.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that disease {{resistance}} genes diverge under recurrent positive selection {{as a result of a}} molecular arms-race between hosts and pathogens. However, these studies have been conducted mainly in animals and few plant genes have been shown to evolve adaptively. The study of plant molecular adaptation for disease resistance is fundamental to our understanding of plant-microbe interactions and to the development of novel plant breeding strategies. Here, we combined information from the expression pattern of Sorghum bicolor genes and their divergence to rice in order to identify candidate disease response genes (DRGs). We used evolutionary analyses of orthologous DRG sets from grass species to identify positively selected genes and the targeted residues. Six genes showed a pattern of substitution consistent with positive selection: a thaumatin, a peroxidase and a barley mlo homolog, all known antifungal proteins; and a MADS box gene, an eIF 5 gene and a gene of unknown function: SESPY. All adaptive sites mapped to the surface of the crystal structures of peroxidase and thaumatin and several are close to the active sites. This information provides a basis for functional validation studies, the identification of accessions having variation at important residues and the rational design of DRGs. Rapid divergence through positive selection should correlate to reduced intraspecific polymorphism. Here we compare the macroevolution and intraspecific polymorphism of positively selected disease response genes and show that the patterns of polymorphism found are consistent with both selective sweeps and balancing selection. The sorghum mlo homolog and SESPY, have old, divergent alleles, while a peroxidase and a gene with a RNA binding domain have significantly reduced diversity suggesting a recent selective sweep. Finally, we show that sorghum DRGs are significantly closer to the telomere and have more exons than a control set of evenly expressed genes. The evidence from gene location; structure; macro-evolution and polymorphism of these DRGs point to the great selective pressure produced by pathogens which has driven the evolution of <b>cereal</b> genome <b>content,</b> order and function...|$|R

Methods: Nutritional information was collected through an Internet and supermarket research for N = 433 breakfast cereals (N = 380 complete data included in the analyses). Breakfast cereals were categorized according to common attributes in terms of processing and/or ingredients used. The FSA score and 5 -CNL category allocation were computed for each <b>cereal.</b> Nutrient <b>content</b> and FSA score were compared across types of cereals. Distribution within the 5 -CNL categories was assessed across types of cereals and for equivalent products. Impact of reformulation (reduction of 5 and 10 % in simple sugar, saturated fat and sodium) on the 5 -CNL category allocation was compared to original allocation with Bapkhar’s tests of homogeneity of marginal distribution. Results: Variability in nutritional quality of breakfast cereals was high, as reflected by the FSA score (range − 7 - 22 for a theoretical range of − 15 - 40) and the 5 -CNL (all five categories represented). The 5 -CNL allowed for discrimination across types of cereals, within categories of breakfast cereals and for equivalent products (at least 3 categories of the 5 -CNL represented). Reformulation scenarios allowed for significant change in 5 -CNL allocation: 5 % reduction in sugar lead to a modification of the label for 4. 21 % of products while a reduction of 10 % of sugar, saturated fat and sodium lead to a modification of the label for 19. 2 % of products. Conclusion: The 5 -CNL adequately discriminates between breakfast cereals. It would therefore be an adequate tool for consumer information on nutritional quality of foods in the French context...|$|R
40|$|Lead and cadmium {{have become}} highly toxic {{metallic}} elements. There {{is an obvious}} 5 toxicological impact of these elements on infants since their intestinal absorption is 6 significantly higher than in adults, thus it is desirable to quantify lead and cadmium levels in 7 commonly consumed infant foods. Zeeman background correction, transversely heated 8 graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry, {{was used to determine}} both the lead and 9 cadmium content of 91 Spanish infant cereals. Cereals were assessed in terms of different 10 types, cereal predominant in formulation and whether it was obtained organically or 11 conventionally. Preliminary analysis revealed a noticeably higher content of lead and 12 cadmium (median, Q 1 -Q 3) in organic cereals (n = 17, Pb: 26. 07; 21. 36 - 51. 63; Cd: 18. 52; 16. 56 - 28. 50 μg kg- 1 13) in relation to conventional ones (n = 74, Pb: 10. 78; 6. 43 - 19. 33; Cd: 7. 12; 4. 40 - 11. 77 μg kg- 1 14). Three formulations exceeded European lead maximum levels. Added 15 ingredients (milk, cocoa, fruit and honey) to the cereal base provide lead enrichment. For 16 cadmium, this pattern was observed by cereal based on cocoa, but also the raw materials 17 contributed with a dilution phenomenon, decreasing the final cadmium concentration in infant 18 cereal. Apart from several organically produced <b>cereals,</b> lead <b>content</b> showed a narrow 19 variation, where gluten-free cereals provide lower cadmium content than formulations 20 containing gluten. Dietary intakes of both elements were assessed in comparison with the 21 reference intake values proposed by the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain. 22 Organic infant cereals based on honey and cocoa supplied the highest risk intakes of lead and 23 cadmium, respectively. In accordance with the actual state of knowledge on lead and 24 cadmium toxicity and attending to the upper limits calculated from risk intake values set by 25 EFSA, it seems prudent to call for a revision of both heavy metals content regulated by EC to set a maximum guideline values for infant cereal at 55 and 45 μg kg- 1 26, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Most dry dog {{foods are}} based on cereals, but very little {{published}} information and few comparative studies {{are available on the}} nutritive value of various cereals in dogs. To determine the apparent nutrient digestibilities and feed values of five different autoclave-processed and ground cereals: oat groats, barley, wheat, corn and rice, a digestibility trial was carried out on twelve adult huskies according to a 6 x 4 cyclic changeover design. Total tract organic matter (OM), crude carbohydrate and gross energy (GE) digestibilities were higher in rice than in all the other cereals. Apparent crude protein (CP) and acid hydrolyzed fat digestibilities of rice (80 % and 94 %, respectively) were as good as for oat groats (81 % and 93 %). However, oat groats had higher OM, CP and GE digestibilities than barley, wheat and corn. The amount of digestible crude protein (118 g kg- 1 DM) was higher in oat groats than in the other <b>cereals.</b> Digestible energy <b>contents</b> (MJ kg- 1 DM) of oat groats, rice, corn, wheat and barley were 17. 1, 16. 0, 15. 7, 15. 6 and 15. 5, respectively. The quantity of excreted wet faeces increased and the percentage of dry matter (DM) in faeces decreased when oat groats, barley, wheat or corn were supplemented to the basal diet, in contrast to rice, which had the opposite effect on wet faeces excretion. Oat groats are good substitutes for rice or other cereals in dry dog foods. ...|$|R
40|$|Grain legumes, {{together}} with quinoa and amaranth (pseudocereals) {{and other crops}} are attractive candidates to satisfy the growing demand for plant protein production worldwide for food and feed. Despite their high value, many protein crops have not been adequately assessed and numerous species are underutilized. Special attention has {{to be paid to}} genetic diversity and landraces, and to the key limiting factors affecting yield, including water deficiency and other abiotic and biotic stresses, in order to obtain stable, reliable and sustainable crop production through the introduction and local adaptation of genetically improved varieties. Legumes, the main protein crops worldwide, contribute to the sustainable improvement of the environment due to their ability to fix nitrogen and their beneficial effects on the soil. They {{play a key role in}} the crop diversification and sustainable intensification of agriculture, particularly in light of new and urgent challenges, such as climate change and food security. In addition, the role of legumes in nutrition has been recognized as a relevant source of plant protein, {{together with}} other benefits for health. Chapters dealing with common bean, lupine, soybean, lentil, cowpea and Medicago are included in this book. Most contributions deal with legumes, but the significant number of papers on different aspects of quinoa gives an idea of the increasing importance of this protein crop. Pseudocereals, such as quinoa and amaranth, are good sources of proteins. Quinoa and amaranth seeds contain lysine, an essential amino acid that is limited in other grains. Nutritional evaluations of quinoa indicate that it constitutes a source of complete protein with a good balance among all of the amino acids needed for human diet, and also important minerals, vitamins, high quality oils and flavonoids. Other protein crops also included in this book are hemp, cotton and cereals (maize, wheat and rice). Although <b>cereals</b> protein <b>content</b> is not high, their seeds are largely used for human consumption. In this book are included articles dealing with all different aspects of protein crops, including nutritional value, breeding, genetic diversity, biotic and abiotic stress, cropping systems or omics, which may be considered crucial to help provide the plant proteins of the future. Overall, the participation of 169 authors in 29 chapters in this book indicates an active scientific community in the field, which appears to be an encouraging reflect of the global awareness of the need for sustainability and the promising future of proteins crops as a source of food and feed.

Despite the importance for host-microbe interactions and bacterial colonization, dietary {{responses of the}} mucosa-associated bacterial communities are less well investigated. In the present study, we characterized the mucosa-associated bacterial communities at the Pars non-glandularis of the stomach, ileum and colon, and identified shifts in these communities in response to different dietary calcium-phosphorus (Ca-P) contents (100 % versus 190 % of the Ca and P requirements) in combination with two basal diets (wheat-barley- or corn-based) in weaned pigs. Pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA genes from 93 mucosal samples yielded 447, 849 sequences, clustering into 997 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97 % similarity level. OTUs were assigned to 198 genera belonging to 14 different phyla. Correlation-based networks revealed strong interactions among OTUs at the various gastrointestinal sites. Our data describe a previously not reported high diversity and species richness at the Pars non-glandularis of the stomach in weaned pigs. Moreover, high versus adequate Ca-P content significantly promoted Lactobacillus by 14. 9 % units (1. 4 fold change) at the gastric Pars non-glandularis (P =  0. 035). Discriminant analysis revealed dynamic changes in OTU composition in response to dietary <b>cereals</b> and Ca-P <b>contents</b> at all gastrointestinal sites which were less distinguishable at higher taxonomic levels. Overall, this study revealed a distinct mucosa-associated bacterial community at the different gut sites, and a strong effect of high Ca-P diets on the gastric community, thereby markedly expanding our comprehension on mucosa-associated microbiota and their diet-related dynamics in weaned pigs...|$|R

A cross-sectional study contained 368 stratified randomly selected children aged 4 – 14 years was conducted with 24 -h retrospective questionnaire based on a pre-investigation. Food and hair samples were collected and had Se contents determined with hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry. Average hair Se content of 349. 0 ± 60. 2 ng/g in KBD-endemic counties was significantly lower than 374. 1 ± 47. 0 ng/g in non-KBD counties. It was significantly higher in the male children (365. 2 ± 52. 3 ng/g) than in the female (345. 0 ± 62. 2 ng/g, p = 0. 002) and significantly higher in the 4. 0 – 6. 9 years group (375. 2 ± 58. 9 ng/g) than the 7. 0 – 14. 0 years group (347. 0 ± 56. 1 ng/g, p < 0. 01). Gender, living area, Se intake without supplements, Se-enriched salt, oil source and protein intake were identified as significant factors of hair Se <b>contents.</b> <b>Cereals,</b> meat and milk were commonly included as significant food categories that mainly contributed to Se intake without supplement of the whole population. Balanced dietary structure without Se supplement could effectively enhance and maintain children’s Se nutrition.

40|$|In this study, some {{physical}} and chemical properties of two cultivated varieties of guinea corn (brown and white) were studied. The physical properties are pericarp, colour, kernel size, 1000 -kernel weight and moisture content. Standard laboratory procedures by Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) were followed to obtain chemical compositions such as oil, crude fibre, ash and protein from the two varieties of guinea corn. The results show that brown variety contains 5. 03 % oil, 2. 33 % crude fibre, 1. 87 % ash and 10. 80 % protein; while the white variety contains 3. 03 % oil, 1. 97 % crude fibre, 1. 99 % ash and 10. 00 % protein. Nitrogen free extracts were found to be 1. 66 % and 73. 97 % for brown and white samples, respectively. The amylose contents were 35. 00 % for brown and 21. 67 % for white. Mineral contents such as calcium, potassium and phosphorus determined showed that the brown variety contains 0. 14 % calcium, 0. 19 % potassium and 0. 16 % phosphorus while the white variety contains 0. 27 % calcium, 0. 21 % potassium and 0. 12 % phosphorus. The carbohydrate and energy values were obtained to be 72. 12 % and 374. 07 kcal/ 100 g for brown and 73. 98 % and 363. 10 kcal/ 100 g for white. From the results, even though the carbohydrate and energy values of guinea corn compare favourably well with those of other <b>cereals,</b> the mineral <b>contents</b> were lower than the previously reported values for cereals generally. Thus, in formulating animal feed or for human consumption it is recommended to mix the two varieties of guinea corn with protein rich foodstuff such as wheat or soyabean, so as to obtain the optimum dietary requirement needed by the body...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 48 - 52) This study {{focuses on}} {{an investigation of}} Saturday morning television food ads {{to determine the extent}} to which the food products advertised are high in sugar content and to examine the affect these ads have on primary grade children by determining to what extent parents actually purchase these products. Questionnaires were used as a primary tool in this study. These were distributed to children's parents at a medium sized elementary school in the eastern part of the San Fernando Valley. The study design includes a description of the television program samplings taken on Saturday morning as well as a description of the subjects to whom the questionnaires were distributed. A descriptive analysis approach was used to treat the statistics. This study reveals that the majority of the products advertised on Saturday morning television are sugared foods. Parents' reports of their children's food preferences illustrated that they chose the heavy, heavy-medium sugared food products most (1 st and 2 nd ingredients, sugar) as opposed to the food products which were low in sugar content (3 rd ingredient, sugar). In the food category of cereals parents did not yield to their childrens' requests of the heavily sugared cereals. They purchased cereals which were lowest in sugar content. This is not true of snacks and beverages, however. While children did not request the quick food items most, they still proved to be very popular with parents. A significant finding of this study is that parents did not yield to their children's requests for the high sugar <b>content</b> <b>cereals</b> the majority of the time. It appears parents place considerable emphasis on the nutrition of their children with regard to breakfast whereas they seemed to show less concern regarding the snack foods their children eat...|$|R
40|$|Screening of {{wild and}} {{cultivated}} rice in IRRI germplasm collection revealed that majority have intermediate apparent amylose content. It appears that ancient farmers selected rice based on {{texture of the}} lower amylose varieties, considering {{that the majority of}} rice consumers today prefer intermediate to soft-textured rice. Furthermore, 30 % seems to be the natural upper natural limit of amylose levels in wild-type rice. If this is the case, the rich biodiversity of rice has been subjected to the bottleneck of domestication to select for grains that have superior cooking and eating but not nutritional or satiating qualities considering that the majority of rice consumers today eat rice three times a day. On the other hand, the amylose content of available rice mutants with deficient SBEIIb or an over-expressed GBSSI also revealed amylose levels of around 35 % which is significantly lower by comparison with other high amylose <b>cereals,</b> whose amylose <b>content</b> ranges from 70 – 90 %. Hence, to produce the high amylose phenotype in rice, one might need to target different sets of enzymes or regulatory pathways. Since increasing the amylose levels in rice might mean a concomitant increase in its resistant starch content and in its levels of satiety, and a decrease in its glycemic response, developing high amylose rice by biotechnology is imperative. This type of rice will be important not only in addressing the growing obesity epidemic which now also affects the developing countries but also as a basis of novel degradable biopolymers and for further elucidating the mechanisms of starch synthesis in the cereal endosperm. In this paper, we also present the status of our research project which aims to silence the expression of SBEIIa, SBEIIb and SSIIa singly or in combination using microRNA and RNAi silencing technologies with the aim of increasing the amylose levels in rice beyond its natural limits...|$|R
40|$|Growing cereal-legume {{mixtures}} {{is associated}} with N transfer from the legume to the accompanying cereal and offers the potential for {{reducing the amount of}} N-fertiliser used in cereal grain production. Cereal crops grown in these mixtures tend to accumulate more protein in their grain. At the same time they extend their growing season. The traditional oat production system in Poland is based on covered oats grown with vetch on poor and damp soils. Our objective was to determine the grain yield and quality of a naked oat cultivar grown as a pure crop and with a spring vetch companion crop. The field experiment was conducted at the Czyrna Experimental Station from 1999 to 2002. The naked oat cv. Akt was sown either as a pure crop or with spring vetch determinate cv. Ina at two seed rates. The amount of rainfall over the experimental years varied from 737 to 1040 mm, corresponding with the multiannual average of 834 mm. The effect of graded seed rates of spring vetch on yield and gross chemical composition of naked oat grain (AOAC, 1995) and ?-glucans content (the Megazyme assay kit no 995. 16) were determined. The present results confirm earlier findings indicating that total yields of wheat and triticale grown with legume companion plants were decreased with decreasing cereal seeding rates (Pisulewska, 1997). <b>Cereal</b> grain protein <b>content</b> was increased with increasing seeding rates of legume companions. We confirmed the negative relationship between oat grain protein and fat content, while ash and ?-glucans were only little, although significantly affected. In conclusion, the relative changes in grain yield and quality of naked oat grown either as a pure crop or with a spring vetch companion plant, were similar to those observed for wheat and triticale.
