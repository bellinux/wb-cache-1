5|$|In 2003, {{evidence}} of tumors, including hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer, and osteoblastoma, {{was described in}} Edmontosaurus bones. Rothschild et al. tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, also tested positive. Although more than 10,000fossils were examined in this manner, the tumors were limited to Edmontosaurus and closely related genera. The tumors may {{have been caused by}} environmental factors or genetic propensity.|$|E

25|$|X-rays and <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) are not used, {{especially}} in the first trimester, due to the ionizing radiation, which has teratogenic effects on the foetus. No effects of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the foetus have been demonstrated, but this technique is too expensive for routine observation. Instead, obstetric ultrasonography is the imaging method of choice in the first trimester and throughout the pregnancy, because it emits no radiation, is portable, and allows for realtime imaging.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{diagnostic}} tests, such as cerebral imaging using <b>Computerized</b> <b>Tomography</b> (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and ultrasound {{are also}} useful, but not preferred to clinical assessments.

25|$|All {{people who}} present with red flags {{indicating}} a dangerous secondary headache should receive neuroimaging. The best form of neuroimaging for these headaches is controversial. Non-contrast <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) scan {{is usually the}} first step in head imaging as it is readily available in Emergency Departments and hospitals and is cheaper than MRI. Non-contrast CT is best for identifying an acute head bleed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is best for brain tumors and problems in the posterior fossa, or back of the brain. MRI is more sensitive for identifying intracranial problems, however it can pick up brain abnormalities that are not relevant to the person's headaches.|$|E
25|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} {{cell proliferation}} {{may arise from}} miR-21 interaction with MAP2K3, a tumor repressor gene. Optimal treatment for cancer involves accurately identifying patients for risk-stratified therapy. Those with a rapid response to initial treatment may benefit from truncated treatment regimens, showing the value of accurate disease response measures. Cell-free miRNA are highly stable in blood, are overexpressed in cancer and are quantifiable within the diagnostic laboratory. In classical Hodgkin lymphoma, plasma miR-21, miR-494, and miR-1973 are promising disease response biomarkers. Circulating miRNAs {{have the potential to}} assist clinical decision making and aid interpretation of positron emission tomography combined with <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography.</b> They can be performed at each consultation to assess disease response and detect relapse.|$|E
25|$|In November 2007, Homann {{took the}} skull {{to the office}} of {{anthropologist}} Jane MacLaren Walsh, in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History for examination. Walsh carried out a detailed examination of the skull using ultraviolet light, a high-powered light microscope, and <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography.</b> Homann took the skull to the museum again in 2008 so it could be filmed for a Smithsonian Networks documentary, Legend of the Crystal Skull and on this occasion Walsh was able to take two sets of silicone molds of surface tool marks for scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. The SEM micrographs revealed evidence that the crystal had been worked with a high speed, hard metal rotary tool coated with a hard abrasive such as diamond. Walsh's extensive research on artifacts from Mexico and Central America showed that pre-contact artisans carved stone by abrading the surface with stone or wooden tools and in later pre-Columbian times, copper tools, in combination with a variety of abrasive sands or pulverized stone. These examinations led Walsh {{to the conclusion that the}} skull was probably carved in the 1930s, and was most likely based on the British Museum skull which had been exhibited fairly continuously from 1898.|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mest., Imagiologia Médica, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, 2007 The {{purpose of}} this study has {{consisted}} in the analysis of the impact of Digital Technology and Teleradiology in the assistance capacity of the Imagiology Department of Hospital Padre Américo – Vale do Sousa, in the first 4 years of activity. We analysed statistically the clinical and material data of how the Department works and we assessed the results obtained from the inquiry done to the Medical and Technician staff, concerning the importance of Digital Technology and Teleradiology. In the period that we analysed, we observed that the increased use of <b>Computerized</b> <b>Tomographies</b> matched the needs of the Outpatient, Inpatient and Emergency Department. The average time of patient’s internment was reduced and the hospital transference index from the Emergency Department was greatly reduced in 2004 and in 2005. If we compare it with the Conventional System, we verify that the costs of the Digital System were due to the buying, maintenance and updating of adequate equipment, while operating costs with personal and materials were lower in percentage, if compared with the costs of assistance statistics. Most of the professionals acknowledged the advantages of the Digital System and most of them have adjusted well to the new technology and expressed themselves favourably towards Teleradiology. We can conclude that the implementation of the Digital System in the Imagiology Department lead to an improvement in its services and that Teleradiology was also an advantage (in spite of its costs), allowing the interpretation of the Neuroradiology exams and the permanent reading of the <b>Computerized</b> <b>Tomographies</b> outside the normal hospital schedule...|$|R
40|$|Neurocysticercosis is the {{infection}} of {{the central nervous system}} by the larval form of Taenia solium, the Cysticercus cellulosae. We studied 4011 <b>computerized</b> <b>tomographies</b> performed in TomoHPI Radioimaging Service, Hospital Pedro I, Campina Grande PB, Northern Brazil, since its installation on August 1993 to July 1995. 41 patients were diagnosed as having Cysticercus cerebral infestation, corresponding to an incidence of 1. 02 %. No cases were related in Campina Grande PB during 1991 according to hospitalizations under prospective payment rates. After this radioimaging service installation, we observed 1. 86 cases per month. We conclude that Campina Grande has to be included as an endemic area of neurocysticercosis, needing health service measures to cease the cycle Taenia-Cysticercus, {{the only way to get}} rid of such a serious problem...|$|R

25|$|On January 15, 2005, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Dr. Madeeha Khattab, the Dean of the School of Medicine at Cairo University, Tutankhamun was removed from the tomb and a CT scan (<b>computerized</b> <b>tomography)</b> was performed on the mummy. The scan allowed for accurate forensic reconstruction of his body and face, as well as further evidence of his cause of death. Testing showed there was no traumatic injury to the head, he had a small cleft palate that went probably unnoticed, and the elongated shape of his skull was within the normal range and appeared to be a family trait after some studies were done on mummies that were believed to have been related to Tutankhamun. Based on bone maturity and his wisdom teeth, Tutankhamun was confirmed to be 19 {{years old at the time}} of his death. The CT scan proved Tutankhamun was in good health and did not show any signs of disease that would have affected his build. Study concluded he was not murdered from traumatic head injury, but a non-violent murder could still not be ruled out. There appeared to be no indication of any long-term disease.|$|E
500|$|A {{physical}} examination, sometimes {{combined with}} a psychological examination, can determine whether {{the onset of the}} disease has begun. [...] Excessive unintentional movements of any part of the body are often the reason for seeking medical consultation. [...] If these are abrupt and have random timing and distribution, they suggest a diagnosis of HD. [...] Cognitive or behavioral symptoms are rarely the first symptoms diagnosed; they are usually only recognized in hindsight or when they develop further. [...] How far the disease has progressed can be measured using the unified Huntington's disease rating scale, which provides an overall rating system based on motor, behavioral, cognitive, and functional assessments. [...] Medical imaging, such as <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can show atrophy of the caudate nuclei early in the disease, as seen in the illustration to the right, but these changes are not, by themselves, diagnostic of HD. [...] Cerebral atrophy {{can be seen in the}} advanced stages of the disease. [...] Functional neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), can show changes in brain activity before the onset of physical symptoms, but they are experimental tools, and are not used clinically.|$|E
