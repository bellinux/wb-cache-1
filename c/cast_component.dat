40|$|The {{steadily}} {{increasing use of}} ductile cast iron and the necessity for building larger <b>cast</b> <b>components</b> present new challenges to the designers. In despite of large <b>cast</b> <b>components</b> are designed adhered to standards, unexpected failure sometime occurs. One reason is the inevitable manufacturing defects containing within the <b>cast</b> <b>components</b> that behave like cracks under cyclic loading. In addition {{the probability of a}} large defect to be situated at a critical region of the component increases with the size. Another reason is the effect of geometric discontinuities such as holes, threads and fillets, which are part unavoidable of the designs. These discontinuities that are usually called notches disturb the stress field and cause high local stress concentration. Thus dealing with these severe stress risers (defects and notches) is not an easy task. Therefore most designers resort to use very high and unnecessary safety factors.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{interacting}} complex phenomena takes {{place during the}} casting of metallic components. Here molten metal is poured into a mould cavity where it flows, cools, solidifies and then deforms in its solid state. As the metal cools, thermal gradients will promote thermal convection which will redistribute the heat around the component (usually from feeders or risers) towards the solidification front and mushy zone. Also, as the evolving solid regions of the <b>cast</b> <b>component</b> deform they will form gap at the cast-mould interface. This gap may change the rate of solidification in certain parts the casting, hence affecting {{the manner in which}} the <b>cast</b> <b>component</b> solidifies. Interaction between a <b>cast</b> <b>component</b> and its surrounding mould will also govern stress magnitudes in both the cast and mould -these may lead to defects such as cracks.

40|$|In {{structural}} optimization, we wish {{to design}} a component such that we fulfill a set of functional requirements while minimizing, for instance, the cost or weight of a component. Here {{we focus on the}} optimization of cast components in trucks. Of the functional requirements, several are related to strength issues. For a <b>cast</b> <b>component,</b> the resulting mechanical behavior depends on the casting process, and it {{must be taken into account}} that strong couplings exist between the geometry, the production process and the material properties. As a result, one is faced with a complex multidisciplinary optimization problem. In this contribution, a generic process for optimizing complex multi-physics problems is presented using a succession of more and more complex analyzes. The strategy that we propose is to use low level analyzes to scan a large number of different solutions in order to find the most viable ones. These are then further narrowed down during a chain of analyzes with successively higher level of detail, while trying not to remove good solutions. During the very latest stages of the analysis, only a few solutions are considered, and therefore, more time and resource consuming analyzes can be used in order to fully investigate the properties of the component.
