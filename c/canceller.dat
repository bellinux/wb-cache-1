CTOs are created by postal authorities to sell the stamps cheaply to stamp collectors. [...] Many Eastern European countries and others sold great numbers of CTOs to collectors in the 1950s - 1990s strictly for revenue. [...] CTOs often may be identified as the stamps still retain their original gum.

50|$|Rapid {{advances}} {{in the implementation of}} digital signal processing allowed echo <b>cancellers</b> to be made smaller and more cost-effective. In the 1990s, echo <b>cancellers</b> were implemented within voice switches for the first time (in the Northern Telecom DMS-250) rather than as standalone devices. The integration of echo cancellation directly into the switch meant that echo <b>cancellers</b> could be reliably turned on or off on a call-by-call basis, removing the need for separate trunk groups for voice and data calls. Today's telephony technology often employs echo <b>cancellers</b> in small or handheld communications devices via a software voice engine, which provides cancellation of either acoustic echo or the residual echo introduced by a far-end PSTN gateway system; such systems typically cancel echo reflections with up to 64 milliseconds delay.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at double-talk {{detection}} for {{acoustic echo}} <b>cancellers</b> enabling transmission of speech signals in stereo. Double-talk detectors {{are affected by}} the same known non-uniqueness problem as echo <b>cancellers.</b> However, echo <b>cancellers</b> are usually adapted using NLMS-like iterative algorithms. Double-talk detectors being based on pseudo-coherence employ traditional spectral estimation techniques, which involve the use of temporal windows. These windows cause a bias of the coherence between the loudspeaker channels: this bias causes the magnitude squared coherence to be smaller than one. Therefore, the non-uniqueness problem known for echo <b>cancellers</b> does not exist for the mentioned type of double-talk detectors. However, the correlation between the loudspeaker channels provoke a strong bias of the inherent estimation of the echo paths. Consequently, we propose a method to decrease the influence of inter-channel correlations on the reliability of the double-talk detector. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this contribution, we {{introduce}} a novel framework for combining approaches for acoustic echo cancellation and beamforming. Classical schemes of combination incorporate the simple concatenation of both subsystems. However, if the echo <b>cancellers</b> come first, they cannot exploit the noise reduction {{capabilities of the}} beamformer. In the other setup, a time-variant beamformer can heavily disturb the succeeding echo <b>canceller’s</b> convergence. The new approach establishes a possibility to smoothly switch between two possible target functions: the mean squared errors at the beamformer’s inputs and its output, respectively. Thus, one combined system benefits from advantages of both classical schemes. The paper contains a theoretical analysis of possible solutions for preceding echo <b>cancellers,</b> which are adapted using the beamformer output. The appropriate modification of the normalized least mean squares algorithm is derivated, too. 1...|$|R

30|$|Line {{selection}} (LS), tone selection (TS), {{and joint}} tone-line selection (JTLS) partial crosstalk <b>cancellers</b> {{have been proposed}} to reduce the online computational complexity of far-end crosstalk (FEXT) <b>cancellers</b> in digital subscriber lines (DSL). However, when the crosstalk profile changes rapidly over time, there is an additional requirement that the partial crosstalk <b>cancellers,</b> particularly the LS and JTLS schemes, should also provide a low preprocessing complexity. This {{is in contrast to}} the case for perfect crosstalk <b>cancellers.</b> In this paper, we propose two novel channel matrix inversion methods, the approximate inverse (AI) and reduced inverse (RI) schemes, which reduce the recurrent complexity of the LS and JTLS schemes. Moreover, we propose two new classes of JTLS algorithms, the subsort and Lagrange JTLS algorithms, with significantly lower computational complexity than the recently proposed optimal greedy JTLS scheme. The computational complexity analysis of our algorithms shows that they provide much lower recurrent complexities than the greedy JTLS algorithm, allowing them to work efficiently in very fast time-varying crosstalk environments. Moreover, the analytical and simulation results demonstrate that our techniques are close to the optimal solution from the crosstalk cancellation point of view. The results also reveal that partial crosstalk cancellation is more beneficial in upstream DSL, particularly for short loops.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In passive UHF RFID systems {{backscattering}} is {{used for}} tag to reader communication. This technique relies on a continuous wave signal being transmitted by the reader during the tag’s data transfer. In order to separate transmission and reception paths circulators, directional couplers or disjoint transmit and receive antennas can be used. Perfect isolation is not achievable with any of those approaches. So a leaking carrier is present at the receiver in any case. It is possible to reduce the interference from this signal by some kind of leaking carrier cancellation. Such a cancellation prevents receiver blocking and reduces the baseband hardware’s requirements, depending on the receiver concept. Usually, the narrowband properties of carrier <b>cancellers</b> are studied. This is only sufficient for conventional RFID systems, if the transmitter noise can be neglected. Broad-band RFID systems, as recently discussed in literature, also require broadband leaking carrier <b>cancellers.</b> In this paper the broadband suppression properties of carrier <b>cancellers</b> are first investigated theoretically. Further a hardware implementation is presented and characterized. Finally, measurement results are compared to the theoretical findings. I...|$|R

We derive the resulting detectors and evaluate their performance. Results show that they can achieve near-optimum performance and outperform several previously proposed multiuser detectors. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{techniques}} and algorithms for mitigating {{radio frequency interference}} (RFI) affecting radio astronomy observations. In the past radio astronomy has generally been performed in radio-quiet geographical locations and unused parts of the radio spectrum, including small protected frequency bands. The increasing use of the entire spectrum and global transmitters such as satellites are forcing the astronomy community to begin implementing active interference cancelling. The amount of harmful interference affecting observations will also increase as future instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are required to use larger bandwidths to reach up to 100 times the current sensitivity levels, and as spectral line observations require observing in bands licensed to other spectrum users. Particular {{attention is paid to}} interference cancellation algorithms which make use of reference beams. This has proven to be successful in removing interference from the contaminated astronomical data. Reference antenna <b>cancellers</b> are closely analysed, leading to filters and techniques that can offer improved RFI excision for some important applications. It is shown that pre- and post-correlation reference antenna <b>cancellers</b> give similar results, and an important aspect of the <b>cancellers</b> is the use of a second reference signal when the reference interference-to-noise ratio is low. These modified filters can theoretically offer infinite interference suppression in the voltage domain, equivalent to that of post-correlation interference <b>cancellers,</b> and their internal structure can offer an understanding of the residual RFI and added receiver noise components of a variety of reference antenna techniques. The effect of variable geometric delays is also considered and various filters are compared {{as a function of the}} geometric fringe rate...|$|R
