Happily unconscious of these mistakes, Tilly popped it into the pot, and proudly watched it bobbing about before she put the cover on and left it to its fate.|$|R

Heteronormative society {{requires}} non-heterosexuals to "come out" to be recognized, and <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> {{is often}} the most challenging experience for sexual minorities. I will discuss how non-heterosexuals {{deal with the issue}} of <b>coming</b> <b>out,</b> and how sexual minority groups play a role in relation to individuals' <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> process in the Japanese context. I conducted interviews with 24 non-heterosexuals, including people who are involved with sexual minority activities and did participant observation at three sexual minority groups. Based on my respondents' experiences, I will propose the four stages of the <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> process that describes how non-heterosexuals in Japan deal with <b>coming</b> <b>out,</b> which is distinct from the Western model of the <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> process. The study also found that "imaginary social homophobia" influences people's decisions about <b>coming</b> <b>out.</b> At the same time, continuous activities by sexual minority groups contribute to increase the awareness of non-heterosexuality in Japan...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} self-acceptance of {{and dealing with}} {{homosexual}} orientation is called <b>coming</b> <b>out.</b> The <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> {{can be defined as}} an internal psychical conflict between internalized homophobia and also newly identified or at least significantly notified own sexual orientation. It this period of time the risk of social discrimination and psychopathological phenomenons, including depressions, suicides, and drugs abuse, increases. (Weiss, 2010) In the paper, we focused on the <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> process as the risk period for drugs abuse. The paper consists of two parts, theoretical and practical. In the theoretical part, we explain the <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> term, we provide its definition and its phases, which are pre-coming <b>out,</b> the <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> itself, exploration phase, partnership phase, and integration. We search for information about <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> as the risk period in literature. Prior to the description of <b>coming</b> <b>out,</b> we have to briefly describe the current perception of homosexuality, and homophobia. The following chapter focuses on identity, its development, family identity, gender identity, and homosexual identity and its phases, which are identity confusion, identity comparison, tolerance of identity, acceptance of identity and taking pride in the identity. The relation of the <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> and drug abused is connected with the identity acceptance or denial. The last chapter of the theoretical part focuses on drugs, their classification and effects. It also focuses on drugs abuse between homosexuals in general, and on drugs abuse during <b>coming</b> <b>out.</b> In the practical part, focused on <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> perception, we used qualitative research strategy, questioning, and narrative dialogue to express the complex process of <b>coming</b> <b>out.</b> The population sample was selected using the purposive sampling together with the snowball method, the selection criteria was <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> experience and willingness to cooperate. Gathered data were analysed using a clustering method and presented in tables for clarity. The target of the paper was to describe subjective drug abuse experiences between homosexual men during their <b>coming</b> <b>out.</b> The following research question was formulated - Is the <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> the risk period for drugs abuse for homosexuals? During the evaluation of the interviews we found some topics repeating - feelings during the <b>coming</b> <b>out,</b> reasons for drugs abuse, and family. The repeating feelings are fear, sense of guilt, self-hatred, and low self-esteem. The reasons for drug abuse during <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> are gang integration, game, self-confidence increase, and the <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> realization itself. On the family level of the subjects, homosexuality tolerance is low, the subjects distrust the families and family communication is poor. The risk level of <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> period towards drugs abuse is also influenced by the social environment, which includes porn, gay bars, school, internet, and religion. We found that homosexuals using drugs during their <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> subjectively go through <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> more easy compared to the ones not using drugs. A hypothesis was formulated from this conclusion, i. e. drugs usage during <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> helps to easily undergo the <b>coming</b> <b>out.</b> This conclusion cannot be generalized, as it may be influenced by many factors, for example too selective sample - our sample didn't include subjects which didn't use drugs during their <b>coming</b> <b>out.</b> It would be interesting to figure how these people dealt with their <b>coming</b> <b>out.</b> The conclusion is opposed in the discussion section. A practical utilization of the paper is seen in better knowledge of the professional and non-professional public. Families with homosexual member can utilize it as well. The more we know, the more we are able to do, and also in a better and more effective way. The paper can be also used as the starting point for following researches, focused for example on social services provided to the homosexual minority...|$|R
