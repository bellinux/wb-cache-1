2500|$|Emperor Taizong died in 649 and was {{succeeded by}} his son and crown prince Li Zhi (as Emperor Gaozong). [...] Around the new year 667, Emperor Gaozong {{commissioned}} the chancellor Li Ji to command a major attack on Goguryeo, and Hao Chujun was made an assistant to Li Ji, a campaign during which Hao served with distinction. [...] In one particular incident, Hao, who {{was said to be}} obese, was approachinging a Goguryeo city when Goguryeo forces launched a surprise counterattack, causing much alarm for Hao's soldiers. [...] Hao, who was said to be obese, did not panick, and instead pulled out a <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down to eat his rations, while secretly ordering his elite troops to attack Goguryeo forces, defeating them. [...] His calmness impressed his troops.|$|E
60|$|Don Caesar's voice--alone with her! Paul {{gripped his}} <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> upright.|$|E
60|$|He slowly {{moved to}} a <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down, {{drooping}} his head before her.|$|E
60|$|Again fell the {{appealing}} accent, and at {{the same}} instant she left her <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> came <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> on the stool at my feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{told him}} I should not feel lonely, and I should not stir {{out of it}} till he came back. I took {{one of those little}} pine <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down, when I got tired, and looked at the people coming to worship, and the strangers with their guide-books." ...|$|R
50|$|Ms. Tarchuk has a {{long history}} of {{community}} involvement. Prior to provincial politics she <b>chaired</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> on several local health and education boards, and served as an executive member of the Alberta School Boards Association, director of Jubilee Insurance and a board member of the Alberta Educational Technology and Research Foundation.|$|R
60|$|Slowly old Jolyon got {{up out of}} his <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down at {{the table}} to eat his dinner.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Barrett, who, to do him justice, had forgotten, {{fell back}} in his <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> gazing at him, open-mouthed.|$|E
60|$|The doctor took a <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down. Thus entreated to stop, he {{had hardly}} any {{alternative}} but to do so.|$|E
60|$|The florid woman {{brought him}} a <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> down at the table, as Endicott once more began to deal.|$|R
60|$|As Yoosoof {{expressed}} no objection, {{the three}} drew their <b>chairs</b> together <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> {{down to a}} prolonged private and very interesting palaver.|$|R
6000|$|So {{they went}} to the great <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> {{themselves}} down in them, listening to the tramp of the guards outside the doorway. Here Francisco resumed his prayers, while Otter sang songs of the deeds that he had done, and more especially a very long one which he had composed upon the taking of the slave camp--"to keep his heart alive," [...] as he explained to Francisco.|$|R
60|$|He put {{his leather}} bag on a <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down {{opposite}} to his father, composed, and smiling, and humming a little tune.|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned her}} face away and would not answer. He brought another <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down beside her. [...] "My lost, forlorn, betrayed one--" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{he kissed}} Cuthbert again. Then, {{brushing}} aside {{one or two}} intellectuals {{who were in the}} way, he dragged up a <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down.|$|E
60|$|The heavy clouds {{disappeared}} {{and the sun}} came out. The sea changed from grey to blue, and Tredgold and Stobell, coming on deck after a good breakfast, arranged a couple of <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down to admire the scene. Aloft the new sails shone white in the sun, and spars and rigging creaked musically. A little spray came flying at intervals over the bows as the schooner met the seas.|$|R
6000|$|To this Heriot vouchsafed no reply. He, too, drew a <b>chair</b> forward <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> {{opposite}} his visitor, then {{he asked}} abruptly: [...] "Your name and quality?" ...|$|R
60|$|John Effingham raised {{himself in}} his <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> gazing at Paul, as one gazes who expects some {{extraordinary}} developement, though of what nature he knew not.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not lost after all, thank God," [...] said Gaff, {{with a deep}} {{prolonged}} sigh, as he led {{his wife}} to a <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down beside her.|$|E
60|$|When we had {{finished}} our dinner, Mrs. Lecks pushed back her <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> {{for a few}} moments in thought, as was her wont before saying anything of importance.|$|E
60|$|The {{fire had}} died down, so Maude shipped off her <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> {{on the black}} fur rug, with her back against Frank's knees. 'Now, dear, read away!' said she.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stobell {{suddenly}} remembered. For a {{few moments}} he stood irresolute, and then, with an extraordinary contortion of visage, dropped into his <b>chair</b> again <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> gazing blankly before him.|$|R
50|$|Hill {{has been}} on the {{advisory}} council of Book Clubs for Inmates since 2010. He has also {{been a member of the}} Council of Patrons of the Black Loyalist Heritage Society, in Birchtown Nova Scotia, since 2011. Hill is an honorary patron of Project Bookmark Canada since 2012. He is a member of PEN Canada and an active member of the Writers' Union of Canada, for which he has <b>chaired</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> on various committees and served on the National Council.|$|R
60|$|They {{took two}} straw-bottomed <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> near the {{octagonal}} water which completes with its fountain of Cupids the enchanting artificiality of the Luxembourg. The sun shone more kindly now, {{and the trees}} which framed the scene were golden and lovely. A balustrade of stone gracefully enclosed the space, and the flowers, freshly bedded, were very gay. In one corner {{they could see the}} squat, quaint towers of Saint Sulpice, {{and on the other side}} the uneven roofs of the Boulevard Saint Michel.|$|R
60|$|M. de La Tour d'Azyr, overcome, reeled {{away to a}} <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down heavily. Losing {{command of}} himself for a moment, he took his haggard face in his hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll tell you." [...] She {{pulled up}} a brown {{varnished}} <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down. In the village of Crome, it seemed, Sodom and Gomorrah {{had come to a}} second birth.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was quite}} beyond me to {{understand}} what she meant. I took a <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down by her. 'I only know what {{you said to me}} yesterday,' I answered.|$|E
60|$|They were {{punctual}} and Osborn got up {{when his}} agent {{and another man}} came in. Hayes was tall, urbane, and dressed with rather fastidious neatness; Bell was round-shouldered and shabby. He had a weather-beaten skin, gray hair, and small, cunning eyes. Osborn indicated <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down {{at the top of}} the big table. He disliked business and knew the others meant to persuade him to do something he would sooner leave alone. This would have been impossible had he not needed money.|$|R
60|$|Ruth turned {{pale and}} {{dropped into a}} <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> Mr. Swift <b>sat</b> down beside her.|$|R
60|$|At {{the first}} {{declaration}} {{the old man}} had turned round in his <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> staring at his son; but when he heard the second and more dreadful part of the story, his jaw dropped, <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> for some time the picture of an idiot.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she turned}} and walked proudly out of the room. Mrs. Shelby {{followed}} her softly, took one of her hands, drew her down into a <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down beside her.|$|E
60|$|Chloe turned, and {{was walking}} proudly {{out of the}} room. Mrs. Shelby {{followed}} her softly, and took one of her hands, drew her down into a <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down by her.|$|E
60|$|Clennam {{read this}} twice, in silence, and then tore it to pieces. Rigaud in the {{meanwhile}} stepped into a <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> himself on the back with his feet upon the seat.|$|E
60|$|Adam's {{heart beat}} so violently {{he was unable}} to speak--he could only return the {{pressure}} of his friend's hand--and Bartle, drawing up the other <b>chair,</b> came <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> in front of him, taking off his hat and his spectacles.|$|R
6000|$|A voice answered, [...] "Yes." [...] And as {{the door}} swung open, in walked, not Dr. Alec, but Charlie, who {{immediately}} {{took one of the}} hall <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> there with his hat on, rubbing his gloveless hands and blinking as if the light dazzled him, as he said in a rapid, abrupt sort of tone, [...] "I told you I'd come left the fellows keeping it up gloriously going to see the old year out, you know. But I promised never break my word and here I am. Angel in blue, did you slay your thousands?" ...|$|R
60|$|Our hearts re-echoed her words. The sun {{had burst}} through the gauzy mists which veiled it, and the whole broad Weald was washed in golden light. Sitting in our dark and {{poisonous}} atmosphere that glorious, clean, wind-swept countryside seemed a very dream of beauty. Mrs. Challenger held her hand stretched out to it in her longing. We drew up <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> in a semicircle in the window. The atmosphere was already very close. It {{seemed to me that}} the shadows of death were drawing in upon us--the last of our race. It was like an invisible curtain closing down upon every side.|$|R
