40|$|Supernova {{simulations}} to date {{have assumed}} that during core collapse electron <b>captures</b> occur dominantly <b>on</b> free protons, while <b>captures</b> <b>on</b> heavy nuclei are Pauli-blocked and are ignored. We have calculated rates for electron <b>capture</b> <b>on</b> nuclei with mass numbers A= 65 - 112 for the temperatures and densities appropriate for core collapse. We find that these rates are large enough so that, in contrast to previous assumptions, electron <b>capture</b> <b>on</b> nuclei dominates over <b>capture</b> <b>on</b> free protons. This leads to significant changes in core collapse simulations. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, REVTeX...|$|R

5|$|For December 7, Colonel John Laurens {{stated that}} “the loss of Morgan's riflemen was 27 killed and wounded”, while John Donaldson, an American cavalryman wrote that “Morgan had 44 killed & wounded & {{among them was}} Major Morris a brave & gallant officer” This {{reference}} was to Major Joseph Morris of the 1st New Jersey Regiment, so Donaldson's figure was evidently for the whole force under Morgan's command, while Laurens' figure was for the Corps of Riflemen only. Benson Lossing confirms that “twenty-seven were killed and wounded in Morgan's Corps”, while Major Morris was badly wounded and the Maryland Militia lost “16 or 17” wounded. For December 8, David Martin says that the Maryland Militia lost 20 killed or wounded and 15 prisoners. From these sources, the aggregate American loss from December 5–8 would {{appear to have been}} 16 killed or wounded and 24 <b>captured</b> <b>on</b> the 5th; 70 killed or wounded and 15 <b>captured</b> <b>on</b> the 6th; 44 killed or wounded on the 7th and 20 killed or wounded and 15 <b>captured</b> <b>on</b> the 8th. This gives 150 killed or wounded and 54 captured, for a total loss of 204 men.|$|E

40|$|Electron <b>capture</b> rates <b>on</b> neutron-rich nuclei (A> 65) were {{calculated}} within the Random Phase Approximation with partial number formalism, including allowed and forbidden transitions. The partial occupation numbers were provided {{as a function}} of temperature by Shell-Model Monte Carlo calculations, including an pairing+quadrupole interaction. <b>Capture</b> rates <b>on</b> relevent nuclei {{were calculated}} for density and temperature conditions during the core collapse of a massive star. It was found that electron <b>captures</b> <b>on</b> nuclei can compete with electron <b>captures</b> <b>on</b> free protons. Furthermore, they produce neutrinos with average energies lower than neutrinos emitted from <b>captures</b> <b>on</b> free protons, with possible consequences on the cooling of the core.

5|$|After the 1793 {{beheading}} of Louis XVI {{sparked a}} war between Britain and France (see the French Revolutionary Wars), Nova Scotia Governor John Wentworth rented Kavanagh's Island to house 600 French prisoners that had been <b>captured</b> <b>on</b> St. Pierre and Miquelon. The commander of the Halifax garrison, Brigadier General James Ogilvie, objected to the plan, and instead housed the prisoners at Cornwallis Barracks in Halifax.

5|$|After the {{successful}} defence of Wau the 3rd Division began advancing towards Salamaua in April 1943.

5|$|Allenby's {{plan was}} to avoid {{fighting}} in or near Jerusalem but to cut all road access {{to the city and}} force the Ottoman Army to evacuate it. He ordered two infantry divisions; the 52nd (Lowland) (Major General J. Hill) and the 75th Division (Major General P. C. Palin), and two mounted divisions; the Yeomanry and the Australian Mounted Divisions to begin the advance. They were to move eastwards from Latron, which had been <b>captured</b> <b>on</b> 16 November, {{in the same direction as}} the Jaffa to Jerusalem road.|$|E
5|$|Close {{encounters}} {{between the}} Sun and other stars in its birth cluster could {{have resulted in}} the capture of a planet from beyond the Solar System. Three-body interactions during these encounters can perturb the path of planets on distant orbits around another star, or free-floating planets, in a process similar to the capture of irregular satellites around the giant planets, leaving one in a stable orbit around the Sun. A planet that originated in a system with a number of Neptune-massed planets and without Jupiter-massed planets, could be scattered into a more long-lasting distant eccentric orbit, increasing its chances of capture by another star. Although this increases the odds of the Sun capturing another planet from another star, a wide variety of orbits are possible, reducing the probability of a planet being <b>captured</b> <b>on</b> an orbit like that proposed for Planet Nine to 1–2 percent. In a simulation where the capture takes place between co-planar systems a large number of other objects are also captured into orbits aligned with the planet, potentially allowing this capture scenario to be distinguished from others. The likelihood of the capture of a free-floating planet is much smaller, with only 5–10 of 10,000 simulated free-floating planets being <b>captured</b> <b>on</b> orbits similar to that proposed for Planet Nine.|$|E

5|$|For {{the killing}} of the Velvicks, the Lieutenant-Governor Frederick Irwin {{declared}} Yagan, Midgegooroo and Munday to be outlaws, offering rewards of £20 each for the capture of Midgegooroo and Munday, and a reward of £30 for Yagan's capture, dead or alive. Munday successfully appealed against his proscription. Midgegooroo, Yagan and their group immediately moved from their territory north towards the Helena Valley. On 17 May, Midgegooroo was <b>captured</b> <b>on</b> the Helena River. After a brief, informal trial, he was executed by firing squad. Yagan remained at large for over two months.|$|E
