The regions marked * were part of, or ruled by, the Kingdom of Great Britain.

According to the Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups (Thernstrom, S 1980, 'Irish,' p.528), there were 400,000 Americans of Irish birth or ancestry in 1790; half of these were descended from Ulster, and half were descended from other provinces in Ireland.

Typically, guest students <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> are issued a J-1 cultural exchange visa or an F-1 foreign student visa. Students are expected to integrate themselves into the host family, immersing themselves in the local community and surroundings.

Some programs require students to pass a standardized test for English language comprehension prior to being accepted into a program taking them to the United States. Other programs do not examine language ability. Most exchange students become fluent in the language of the host country within a few months. Some exchange programs, such as the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange, are government-funded programs.|$|E

25|$|The War Brides Act of 1945, and {{subsequent}} Alien Fiancées and Fiancés Act of 1946, allowed veterans, {{to return to}} the Philippines to bring back fiancées, wives, and children. In the years following the war, some sixteen thousand Filipinas entered the United States as war brides. That is not to say only women and children were beneficiaries of the acts for it was recorded that a lone Filipino groom immigrated during this period. These new immigrants enabled the formation of a second generation of Filipino Americans that grew the Filipino American communities, providing nuclear families. Immigration levels were impacted by the independence of the Philippines from the United States, that occurred on 4 July 1946. The quota of non-naval immigration increased slightly to 100 due to the passage of the Luce–Celler Act of 1946. Thus, Filipino American communities developed around United States Navy bases, whose impact can still be seen today. Filipino American communities were also settled near Army and Air Force bases. After World War II, until 1965, half of all Filipino immigrants to the United States were wives of U.S. servicemembers. In 1946, the Filipino Naturalization Act allowed for naturalization, and citizenship for Filipinos who had arrived before March 1943. Beginning in 1948, due to the U.S. Education Exchange Act, Filipino nurses began to immigrate to the United States, with 7,000 Filipino nurses <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in 1948.|$|E
