40|$|In {{large scale}} {{learning}} problems {{it is often}} easy to collect simple statistics of the data, but hard or impractical to store all the original data. A key question in this setting is how to construct classifiers based on such partial information. One traditional approach to {{the problem has been}} to use maximum entropy arguments to induce a complete distribution on variables from statis-tics. However, this approach essentially makes conditional independence assumptions about the distribution, and furthermore does not optimize prediction loss. Here we present a framework for discriminative learning given a set of statistics. Specifically, we address the case where all variables are discrete and we have access to various marginals. Our approach minimizes the worst <b>case</b> <b>hinge</b> loss in this case, which upper bounds the generalization error. We show that for certain sets of statistics the problem is tractable, and in the general case can be approximated using MAP LP relaxations. Empirical results show that the method is competitive with other approaches that use the same input. 1...|$|E

[...] Thomas further questioned the law ending the practice of making treaties with the tribes, noting {{that this was the}} one clear constitutional provision that provides for dealing with other sovereigns.
