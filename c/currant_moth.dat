6000|$|As it {{is among}} {{butterflies}} that instances of mimicry are most numerous and most striking, an account {{of some of the}} more prominent examples in this group will first be given. There is in South America an extensive family of these insects, the Heliconidæ, which are in many respects very remarkable. They are so abundant and characteristic in all the woody portions of the American tropics, that in almost every locality they will be seen more frequently than any other butterflies. They are distinguished by very elongate wings, body, and antennæ, and are exceedingly beautiful and varied in their colours; spots and patches of yellow, red, or pure white upon a black, blue, or brown ground, being most general. They frequent the forests chiefly, and all fly slowly and weakly; yet although they are so conspicuous, and could certainly be caught by insectivorous birds more easily than almost any other insects, their great abundance all over the wide region they inhabit shows that they are not so persecuted. It is to be especially remarked also, that they possess no adaptive colouring to protect them during repose, for the under side of their wings presents the same, or at least an equally conspicuous colouring as the upper side; and they may be observed after sunset suspended at the end of twigs and leaves where they have taken up their station for the night, fully exposed to the attacks of enemies if they have any. These beautiful insects possess, however, a strong pungent semi-aromatic or medicinal odour, which seems to pervade all the juices of their system. When the entomologist squeezes the breast of one of them between his fingers to kill it, a yellow liquid exudes which stains the skin, and the smell of which can only be got rid of by time and repeated washings. Here we have probably the cause of their immunity from attack, since {{there is a great deal}} of evidence to show that certain insects are so disgusting to birds that they will under no circumstances touch them. Mr. Stainton has observed that a brood of young turkeys greedily devoured all the worthless moths he had amassed in a night's [...] "sugaring," [...] yet one after another seized and rejected a single white moth which happened to be among them. Young pheasants and partridges which eat many kinds of caterpillars seem to have an absolute dread of that of the common <b>currant</b> <b>moth,</b> which they will never touch, and tomtits as well as other small birds appear never to eat the same species. In the case of the Heliconidæ, however, we have some direct evidence to the same effect. In the Brazilian forests there are great numbers of insectivorous birds--as jacamars, trogons, and puffbirds--which catch insects on the wing, and that they destroy many butterflies is indicated by the fact that the wings of these insects are often found on the ground where their bodies have been devoured. But among these there are no wings of Heliconidæ, while those of the large showy Nymphalidæ, which have a much swifter flight, are often met with. Again, a gentleman who had recently returned from Brazil stated at a meeting of the Entomological Society that he once observed a pair of puffbirds catching butterflies, which they brought to their nest to feed their young; yet during half an hour they never brought one of the Heliconidæ, which were flying lazily about in great numbers, and which they could have captured more easily than any others. It was this circumstance that led Mr. Belt to observe them so long, as he could not understand why the most common insects should be altogether passed by. Mr. Bates also tells us that he never saw them molested by lizards or predacious flies, which often pounce on other butterflies.|$|E
50|$|Other {{common names}} - {{particularly}} in the nonbiological literature - are dried <b>currant</b> <b>moth</b> and fig moth, which invite confusion with the close relatives C. figulilella (raisin moth) and C. calidella (dried fruit moth). C. cautella has achieved an essentially cosmopolitan distribution due to inadvertent transport with its larval food; it has, for example, been transported across Polynesia with copra shipments.|$|E
50|$|Euhyponomeutoides albithoracellus, the <b>currant</b> bud <b>moth,</b> is a moth of the Yponomeutidae family. It {{is found}} in Fennoscandia, Denmark, Germany, Poland, the Baltic region, Romania, Slovakia, Austria, Switzerland and France.|$|R
50|$|Carposina fernaldana, the <b>currant</b> fruitworm <b>moth,</b> is a moth in the Carposinidae family. It was {{described}} by August Busck in 1907. It is found in North America, where it is found from Quebec, along the Mississippi drainage, to Missouri.|$|R
50|$|The <b>currant</b> {{shoot borer}} <b>moth</b> (Lampronia capitella) is {{a species of}} moth of the Prodoxidae family. It is found in most of central, {{northern}} and eastern Europe. It {{is also found in}} North America.|$|R
40|$|After {{an absence}} of 50 years, the <b>currant</b> pug <b>moth,</b> Eupithecia assimilata Doubleday (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), has reappeared as an {{important}} pest of hops, Humulus lupulus L. (Cannabaceae), in the UK. Pheromone gland extracts from virgin female E. assimilata moths were shown to contain (3 Z, 6 Z) -cis- 9, 10 -epoxyheneicosadiene (3 Z, 6 Z-cis- 9, 10 -epoxy- 21 :H) by gas chromatography linked to mass spectrometry. (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) -heneicosatriene (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z- 21 :H) was also found as a minor component {{in one of two}} extracts. In field experiments, significant numbers of male E. assimilata moths were caught in traps baited with the (9 S, 10 R) -enantiomer of 3 Z, 6 Z-cis- 9, 10 -epoxy- 21 :H but not in those baited with the (9 R, 10 S) -enantiomer or racemic mixture. Addition of 3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z- 21 :H at the ratio present in gland extracts greatly reduced the attractiveness of the epoxydiene...|$|R
