40|$|Land-applied manures produce {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 O), a {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG). Land application can also result in ammonia (NH 3) volatilisation, leading to indirect N 2 O emissions. Here, we summarise a glasshouse {{investigation into the}} potential for vermiculite, a clay with a high cation exchange capacity, to decrease N 2 O emissions from livestock manures (beef, pig, broiler, layer), as well as urea, applied to soils. Our hypothesis is that clays adsorb ammonium, thereby suppressing NH 3 volatilisation and slowing N 2 O emission processes. We previously demonstrated the ability of clays to decrease emissions at the laboratory scale. In this glasshouse work, manure and urea application rates varied between 50 and 150 kg nitrogen (N) /ha. Clay : manure ratios ranged from 1  :  10 to 1  :  1 (dry weight basis). In the 1 -year trial, the above-mentioned N sources were incorporated with vermiculite in 1 L pots containing Sodosol and Ferrosol growing a model pasture (Pennisetum clandestinum or kikuyu grass). Gas emissions were measured periodically by placing the pots in gas-tight bags connected to real-time <b>continuous</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysers.</b> The vermiculite achieved significant (P ≤ 0. 05) and substantial decreases in N 2 O emissions across all N sources (70 % on average). We are currently testing the technology at the field scale; which is showing promising emission decreases (~ 50 %) as well as increases (~ 20 %) in dry matter yields. This technology clearly has merit as an effective GHG mitigation strategy, with potential associated agronomic benefits, although {{it needs to be}} verified by a cost–benefit analysis...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} measurement of methane (CH 4) emissions from tree stems {{in a wide range}} of ecosystems so as to determine how they contribute to the total ecosystem flux. To date, tree CH 4 fluxes are commonly measured using rigid closed chambers (static or dynamic), which often pose challenges as these are bulky and limit measurement of CH 4 fluxes to only a very narrow range of tree stem sizes and shapes. To overcome these challenges we aimed to design and test new semi-rigid stem-flux chambers (or sleeves). We compared the CH 4 permeability of the new semi-rigid chambers with that of the traditional rigid chamber approach, in the laboratory and in the field, with continuous flow or syringe injections. We found that the semi-rigid chambers had reduced gas permeability and optimal stem gas exchange surface to total chamber volume ratio (S c / V tot) better headspace mixing, especially when connected in a dynamic mode to a <b>continuous</b> flow <b>gas</b> <b>analyser.</b> Semi-rigid sleeves can easily be constructed and transported in multiple sizes, are extremely light, cheap to build and fast to deploy.

40|$|The main {{topic of}} this Master’s Thesis is the {{development}} of a multilevel sampling system for <b>gas</b> <b>analysers,</b> in which a single <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> can measure the gas composition from gasification or combustion, in three different levels in a riser of a circulating fluidized bed reactor. The two analysers used in this work were the Dx- 4000 GASMET <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> and the Siemens ULTRAMAT 23 <b>gas</b> <b>analysers.</b> The multilevel sampling system consist of three levels, which are connected to the reactor by steel pipes. There is a computer controlled solenoid valves that controls which level is sampled. In addition, there is an oil scrubber in each level to protect the system from unwanted and dangerous substances such as tar. Heat transfer equations have been used in the process of designing the multilevel system in order to not surpass the maximum allowable temperature of some components. The residence time has also been considered in designing the system, as it is an important parameter, since it had to be as short as possible to avoid some changes in the composition of the gas sampled as well as increasing the acquired amount of reliable measurement data from each test. Finally, the transitional and steady time (residence time) for reliable measurements were calculated for both analysers, obtaining 60 seconds of reliable measurements for GASMET analyser and 40 seconds for ULTRAMAT analyser. One combustion test was done in order to check that the system worked correctly, whose the results were satisfactory...|$|R

In this study, variances observed in pH measurements with {{two types of}} blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> were investigated. pH was measured in crystalloid solutions (platelet additive solution (PAS-II), phosphate-buffered solutions) and two types of platelet concentrates (containing 100 % plasma, or 65 % PAS-II/ 35 % plasma) with two blood gas analysers: either using liquid and gas calibration (AVL 945), or only liquid calibration (AVL OMNI). These measurements were compared with a reference method. Especially for PAS-II, large variation in pH was observed between AVL 945, AVL OMNI and the reference method: 6. 91 +/- 0. 02, 7. 35 +/- 0. 02 and 7. 188 +/- 0. 010, respectively (mean +/- SD; n = 12, P < 0. 0001, paired t-test). A significant difference in pH was also found for platelet concentrates in 65 % PAS/ 35 % plasma (6. 88 +/- 0. 09 on AVL 945 and 7. 02 +/- 0. 09 on AVL OMNI, n = 134, P < 0. 0001). Comparison with the reference method revealed minor differences with AVL 945, whereas AVL OMNI gave a mean difference in pH of + 0. 17. Platelets in 100 % plasma revealed smaller differences (6. 93 +/- 0. 13 for AVL 945 and 6. 99 +/- 0. 13 for AVL OMNI, n = 95, P < 0. 0001).

40|$|Background: The Innocor device {{contains}} a highly sensitive photoacoustic <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> {{that has been}} used to perform multiple breath washout (MBW) measurements using very low concentrations of the tracer gas SF 6. Use in smaller subjects has been restricted by the requirement for a <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> response time of, 100 ms, in order to ensure accurate estimation of lung volumes at rapid ventilation rates. Methods: A series of previously reported and novel enhancements were made to the <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> to produce a clinically practical system with a reduced response time. An enhanced lung model system, capable of delivering highly accurate ventilation rates and volumes, was used to assess in vitro accuracy of functional residual capacity (FRC) volume calculation and the effects of flow and gas signal alignment on this. Results: 10 – 90 % rise time was reduced from 154 to 88 ms. In an adult/child lung model, accuracy of volume calculation was 20. 9 to 2. 9 % for all measurements, including those with ventilation rate of 30 /min and FRC of 0. 5 L; for the un-enhanced system, accuracy deteriorated at higher ventilation rates and smaller FRC. In a separate smaller lung model (ventilation rate 60 /min, FRC 250 ml, tidal volume 100 ml), mean accuracy of FRC measurement for the enhanced system was minus 0. 95 % (range 23. 8 to 2. 0 %).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the carriage of a portable <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> during prolonged treadmill exercise at a variety of speeds. Ten male participants completed six trials at different speeds (4, 8 and 12 km h- 1) for 40 min whilst wearing the analyser (P) or where the analyser was externally supported (L). Throughout each trial, respiratory gases, heart rate (HR), perceptions of effort and energy expenditure (EE) were measured. Significantly higher EE occurred during P 12 (p = 0. 01) than during L 12 (855. 3 ± 104. 3; CI = 780. 7 - 930. 0 and 801. 5 ± 82. 2 kcal; CI = 742. 7 - 860. 3 kcal, respectively), but not at the other speeds; despite this, perceptions of effort and HR responses were unaffected. This additional EE is likely caused by alterations to posture which increase oxygen demand. The use of such systems is unlikely to affect low-intensity tasks, but researchers should use caution when interpreting data, particularly when exercise duration exceeds 30 min and laboratory-based analysers should be used where possible. Practitioner Summary: There is extensive use of portable <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> in many settings.

40|$|Gaseous {{pollutants}} {{have been}} an environmental concern since 1956, when the first clean air act {{was established in the}} United Kingdom. Monitoring of gaseous emissions is a legal requirement in most countries, and this has generated a large demand for inexpensive, portable, and versatile <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> for the measurement of gaseous emissions. Many of the current commercial <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> have differing advantages and disadvantages, however, high cost is an important factor. Instruments with low detection limits and the ability to measure multiple gases tend to be very expensive, whereas, single <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> tend to be much more affordable. A non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) spectrometer, originally developed for a previous M. Sc. project, has been further developed in order to increase the sensitivity and to extend the instrument to the measurement of multiple gases. This type of instrument would be useful for environmental, industrial, and research applications. The instrument was inexpensive to construct when compared with the cost of current commercial <b>gas</b> <b>analysers,</b> is robust, and is partially portable around the laboratory. Infrared radiation from two infrared sources, pass through adjacent sample and reference cells and into corresponding detector cells. A sample comprising the analyte gas is contained in the sample cell, a non-absorbing gas, such as argon, is contained in the reference cell, and pure analyte gas of interest is contained in the detector cells. The two identical detector cells, which follow the reference and sample cells in the infrared optic paths, communicate only through a differential capacitance manometer which accurately measures small pressure differences between the otherwise identical cells. Any trace amount of the analyte gas in the sample cell absorbs radiation, depleting the appropriate infrared frequencies. This results in lower energy incident on the sample detector cell, reducing the infrared induced pressure rise in that detector cell compared to the reference side detector cell. The pressure difference is ii proportional to the concentration of absorbing gas in the sample cell, which is then determined using a calibration graph. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide calibration graphs from 40 ppm to 1000 ppm have been successfully established, and detection limits of 10. 33 ppm for CO₂, 8. 81 ppm for N₂O and 9. 17 ppm for CH₄ were determined.
