50|$|After North Carolina Democrats regained {{control of}} the state {{legislature}} in the 1870s (using intimidation by the Red Shirts and other paramilitary groups {{to reduce the number of}} blacks voting), they passed voter registration and electoral laws that restricted voter rolls. Blacks continued to get elected to local and state offices. The state legislature passed a new constitutional amendment in 1900, which effectively disfranchised blacks altogether. This ended the election of blacks to local, state or Congressional offices until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, which enforced <b>constitutional</b> <b>voting</b> rights.|$|R

5000|$|In June 1963, African Americans {{attempted}} to cast {{votes in the}} Mississippi primary election but were prevented from doing so.

5000|$|Mississippi {{passed a}} new {{constitution}} in 1890 that included provisions for poll taxes, literacy tests (which depended on the arbitrary decisions of white registrars), and complicated record keeping to establish residency, which severely {{reduced the number of}} blacks who could register. It was litigated before the Supreme Court. In 1898, in Williams v. Mississippi, the Court upheld the state. Other Southern states quickly adopted the [...] "Mississippi plan", and from 1890 to 1908, ten states adopted new constitutions with provisions to disfranchise most blacks and many poor whites. States continued to disfranchise these groups for decades, until mid-1960s federal legislation provided for oversight and enforcement of <b>constitutional</b> <b>voting</b> rights.|$|R
50|$|From 1890 to 1908, {{southern}} states passed new constitutions and laws to disenfranchise African Americans and many poor whites by creating barriers to voter registration; voting rolls were dramatically reduced as blacks and poor whites were {{forced out of}} electoral politics. While progress was made in some areas, this status of excluding African Americans from the political system lasted in most {{southern states}} until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s to provide federal enforcement of <b>constitutional</b> <b>voting</b> rights. For more than 60 years, blacks in the South {{were not able to}} elect anyone to represent their interests in Congress or local government.

25|$|After {{decades of}} disenfranchisement, African Americans {{in the state}} {{gradually}} began to exercise their right to vote again {{for the first time}} since the 19th century, following the passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965, which ended de jure segregation and enforced <b>constitutional</b> <b>voting</b> rights. Registration of African-American voters increased and black candidates ran in the 1967 elections for state and local offices. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party fielded some candidates. Teacher Robert G. Clark of Holmes County was the first African American to be elected to the State House since Reconstruction. He continued as the only African American in the state legislature until 1976 and was repeatedly elected into the 21st century, including three terms as Speaker of the House.|$|R
