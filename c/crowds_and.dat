40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} {{the psychology of the}} <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> its impact on the individual. The main aim of this work is to understand the general characteristics of the <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> to apply this knowledge to the shopping <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> determine the factors that influence an individual in the shopping crowd the most. The thesis is divided into theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part illustrates the characteristics of collective behavior <b>and</b> of the <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> the factors influencing the crowd in general terms {{and in terms of the}} shopping crowd. The practical part is focused on the shopping <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> is composed of two parts. The first part contains a survey dealing with the mob behavior when purchasing, and its evaluation. The questionnaire of both genders and all age groups was used as a main part of survey. The second part based on outcomes of the theoretical part, survey and data from the media sets the factors influencing the behavior of the shopping crowd. The analysis concludes with a comprehensive evaluation of the thesis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a configurable simulation tool that can simulate <b>crowd</b> movement <b>and</b> behaviour in real time. The tool has three main features: (1) demonstrate {{the impact of}} altering building layout (e. g. size of gates, positions of corridors); (2) highlight the effects on <b>crowd</b> behaviour <b>and</b> movement by varying the crowd composition; (3) demonstrate the influence of different external factors (e. g. signs, guide people) on crowd behaviour. The simulation results {{can be used to}} help improve building layout design or optimise navigation plans. This tool takes the multi-agent system approach to build a crowd model. Each agent re{{presents a}}n intelligent individual in the <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> has a unique set of parameters to distinguish it from others. Agent conducts its behaviour by combining basic steering behaviours. Steering behaviours contain steering forces that are calculated by considering surroundings (including <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> environment objects) as well as individual parameters. All of parameters and steering behaviours are configurable in order to fine-tune the <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> environment to fit various scenarios. Crowd are formed through interaction and collaboration between agents <b>and</b> environment. <b>Crowd</b> movement <b>and</b> behaviour can be observed from the real time simulator. By altering building structure layout, composition of <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> navigation plans, <b>crowd</b> movement <b>and</b> behaviour will change accordingly. Such observations and results will provide useful feedbacks to designers and planners...|$|R

5|$|Although Arsenal {{had been}} {{fighting}} relegation in both the two previous seasons, and despite the chairman's restriction on spending, Chapman nevertheless moved to Arsenal soon afterwards, attracted both by the London club's larger <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> a salary of £2,000, double what he earned at Huddersfield Town. At Arsenal, Chapman immediately made an impact by signing 34-year-old Charlie Buchan, an England international and Sunderland's all-time record goalscorer, whom he made Arsenal captain.|$|E
5|$|As a team, the Australians {{were greeted}} by record <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> gate {{receipts}} across the country, even when wet weather curtailed the matches. The record attendance for a Test match in England was broken three times, in the Second Test at Lord's, the Third Test at Old Trafford, and the Fourth Test at Headingley. The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil.|$|E
5|$|At her Silver Jubilee in 1977, the <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> {{celebrations}} were genuinely enthusiastic, {{but in the}} 1980s, {{public criticism}} {{of the royal family}} increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny. Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public. Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.|$|E

5|$|British Open Championship Golf was {{the third}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was directed by Rex Bradford, designer of the early golf title Mean 18. The team sought to create an accurate simulation of tournament golf play, which they felt was missing in the genre. To achieve this goal, they focused on recreating the atmosphere of a tournament, and included reactive <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> announcers. The game was placed in competition with popular golf series such as Links and PGA Tour.|$|E
5|$|Having made {{considerable}} progress {{over the}} previous two years in U.S.-Soviet relations, Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974. He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony, cheering <b>crowds,</b> <b>and</b> a state dinner at the Grand Kremlin Palace that evening. Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta, where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, détente, and MIRVs. While he considered proposing a comprehensive test-ban treaty, Nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it. There were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter of the 18th century, more {{information}} about cricket became available as the growing newspaper industry took an interest. The sport noticeably began to spread throughout England as the century went on. By 1725, significant patrons such as Edwin Stead, Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and Sir William Gage were forming teams of county strength in Kent and Sussex. The earliest known great players, including William Bedle and Thomas Waymark, were active. Cricket was attracting large, vociferous <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> the matches were social occasions at which gambling and alcoholic drinks were additional attractions.|$|E

The match ended in an easy victory for Australia when New Zealand was bowled out for 42 and 54, but the tour attracted big <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> made a record profit. Hassett scored 351 runs at 70.20 for the whole tour. By the time he returned home from the tour, Hassett had played cricket continuously for almost twelve months.|$|E
5|$|Rugby {{has played}} {{a big part in}} the life of the school, despite only supplanting {{football}} as the school's primary sport in 1921. All boys are encouraged to play when they enter Lower Grammar but are not required to play throughout their time at the school. Stonyhurst has a successful rugby season, with games well supported by pupils, staff and parents. Sporting rivalry is particularly prominent against fellow Catholic independent schools Ampleforth College and Mount St Mary's College and Sedbergh School in Cumbria. The Stonyhurst Sevens take place annually, attracting large <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> teams from all over the country.|$|E

The government's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture {{both inside and outside}} the country.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBoth <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> {{binocular}} rivalry impair object perception, but {{their influence on}} object perception has so far only been investigated in separate fields. Three experiments investigated the joint influences of <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> rivalry on object perception (orientation discrimination). Experiment 1 investigated how <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> rivalry influence orientation discrimination together. Experiment 2 tested whether rivalry between flankers affects crowding using an orientation discrimination task. Experiment 3 tested whether crowding affects the temporal dynamics of the rivalry between a target and a rival stimulus. In Experiment 1, judgments of target orientation were more impaired when <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> rivalry were simultaneously induced than when they were separately induced and their effects were combined. In Experiment 2, judgments of target orientation were impaired even when flankers were undergoing rivalry, thus highlighting {{the importance of the}} presence of flankers. Experiment 3 showed that flankers presented in the neighborhood of a target undergoing rivalry shortened target dominance and prolonged target suppression. The augmented impairments of object perception found in Experiments 1 and 3 suggest that <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> rivalry interact, presumably through signal suppression. The adverse effect of flankers shown in Experiment 2 suggests that inappropriate feature integration may have additionally contributed to this interaction...|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} decade, {{the casino}} began exhibiting burlesque and vaudeville acts to draw <b>crowds,</b> <b>and</b> a raised stage was installed for the live performances.

Basketball was extremely popular in Rosendale in the 1940s. On Friday nights the Firemen's Hall became a dance hall, and people would sometimes square dance in formal attire.|$|E
