5|$|A larger crowd {{attended}} on {{the second}} day, including more men. Amelia Bloomer arrived late and took {{a seat in the}} upstairs gallery, there being none left in the main seating area. Quaker James Mott was well enough to attend, and he chaired the morning meeting; it was still too radical a concept that a woman serve as <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> both men and women.|$|E
25|$|Sunder Singh Lyallpuri had {{received}} his basic education in Shahkot (Pakistan) and then obtained B.A. (Honours) from Khalsa College Amritsar and B.T. from Government College Lahore. Lyallpuri was invited for personal interview {{for the position}} of tehsildar (revenue officer) but he sat in <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Commissioner without his permission. This caused a verbal scuffle {{between him and the}} English officer so that he was sent back without being interviewed. On pressure from his relatives, he later took a position in Indian postal services but here too he was entangled with his English boss. The senior officer called him into his office for inquiry and did not offer him a chair to sit on which again hurt the pride of Sunder Singh. Lyallpuri concluded that his self-respect would not allow him to serve the British Indian government.|$|E
500|$|... "On the Internet, {{nobody knows}} you're a dog" [...] is an adage about Internet {{anonymity}} which {{began as a}} cartoon caption by Peter Steiner and published by The New Yorker on July 5, 1993. The cartoon features two dogs: one sitting on a <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a computer, speaking the caption to a second dog {{sitting on the floor}} listening to the first. As of 2011, the panel was the most reproduced cartoon from The New Yorker, and Steiner has earned over US$50,000 from its reprinting.|$|E

500|$|Roddy Piper {{went on to}} film Hell Comes to Frogtown and They Live {{and made}} {{sporadic}} appearances on television before finally returning to host a Piper's Pit segment at WrestleMania V. Piper continued to be active in professional wrestling at various points {{for more than two}} decades. [...] The first televised match between André and Hogan after WrestleMania III was on The Main Event on NBC on February 5, 1988, drawing a record 33 million viewers, making it the most watched match in North American professional wrestling history. The angle surrounding this match was that after winning the match, André ended Hogan's four-year reign as WWF champion {{with the help of a}} worked screwjob finish involving twin referees Earl and Dave Hebner. Their feud culminated in a rematch at WrestleMania IV as part of a tournament to crown a new champion (both ended up being disqualified during the match for using a steel <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> referee Joey Marella). The Hogan/Andre match at WrestleMania IV was the first ever WrestleMania rematch.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a closed caption that reads [...] "Britney Spears – Stronger", amidst {{the sound of a}} storm. It then cuts to a close up of Spears looking at her boyfriend, who is smiling with another woman holding him. She realizes she is better without him and walks away, after saying, [...] "Whatever," [...] to the audience. There is a shot of the tower hotel they were in, in an {{apparent}} semi-futuristic world, having a party in the restaurant in the hotel tower at the top, and then the hotel tower explodes and blows up. At the beginning of the first chorus, Spears starts dancing with an Emeco 1006-style <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a black background. The second half of the video finds Spears driving away from the party in a classic Ford Mustang car during a thunderstorm; however, before long, her car goes into a spin out, then stops on {{the very edge of the}} bridge. After recovering from the shock of it, she's forced to continue walking on in the rain. Cuts of her dancing with a cane, transformed from the chair, are also included. The video ends with Spears walking across a bridge. Two versions of the video exist, one in which at the end of video, Spears stands in mid-air above the spinning chair, and in the other a close up of her singing. Nuzhat Naoreen of MTV praised the music video, saying, [...] "few performers can work an entire routine on and around a chair as well as Britney did in 'Stronger'". The music video received a nomination on the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Pop Video.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the music}} videos for [...] "If I Were a Boy", [...] "Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)", and [...] "Diva", {{the one for}} [...] "Ego" [...] was shot in black and white. The word [...] "bitch" [...] is muted out when Beyoncé sings, [...] "I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch!". [...] "Ego" [...] is the first video from I Am... Sasha Fierce in which she has curly afro hair, {{similar to the one}} in [...] "Work It Out". It is also the first video from the Sasha Fierce disc of her album where she does not don her robot-glove. The video {{features}} Beyoncé and her two backup female dancers all dressed in silver leotards and performing similar choreography, which has reminiscence of that of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". Later, Beyoncé sits on a white glittery <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the same tiled background; she is wearing black coat and the two dancers are still dancing in unison around her. There are a few shots of her on the chair facing the back of the camera with the dancers doing the same. Beyoncé then gets up to join the dance being executed by the two female around the chair. This scene ends as they walk {{to the left of the}} camera, into the next scene. Beyoncé is still with the tiled background. She and her dancers are now holding poles as props with which they dance. During the same pole scene, some shots of her singing in the chair are intercut. In the next scene, with the same tiled background, Beyoncé is leaning against the wall as the bridge of the song has been reached. Her dancers spin in heels around her, and they all then continue to dance against the wall. The last scene shows Beyoncé in the chair, without the black jacket and still dancing until the song ends.|$|E

2500|$|The Cleves Master was {{a superb}} realist who showed scenes of 15th-century Utrecht, {{especially}} in the small bas-de-page pictures.

[...] The Virgin is seated {{on the other side}} of the fire, suckling Jesus in her neat, orderly kitchen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} measures it {{is composed}} of oil paint and silver and gold leaf on canvas. The portrait shows Adele Bloch-Bauer sitting on a golden throne or <b>chair,</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a golden starry background. Around her neck is the same jewelled choker Klimt included in the Judith painting. She wears a tight golden dress in a triangular shape, made up of rectilinear forms. In places the dress merges into the background {{so much so that}} the museum curator Jan Thompson writes that [...] "one comes across the model almost by accident, so enveloped is she in the thick geometric scheme". Peter Vergo, writing for Grove Art, considers that the painting [...] "marks the height of... gold-encrusted manner of painting".|$|E
2500|$|Noah Mann’s {{early death}} was through a bizarre accident. [...] Haygarth recounts that: [...] "he {{had been out}} shooting, and on {{his return to the}} Half Moon Inn, at Northchapel, wet and tired, he had a free carouse with his companions; refusing to go to bed, he persisted in sleep¬ing all night in his <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the fire. [...] It was and still is the custom {{in that part of the}} country to heap {{together}} all the ashes on the hearth, for the purpose of keeping the fire in till the next day. [...] During the night, having fallen asleep, the sparks ignited his clothes (or, as stated in Nyren’s book, he fell upon the embers), and he was so severely burnt that he died the next day, not surviving twenty-four hours. [...] His death took place at the early age of 33, in December, 1789". [...] A verdict of accidental death was returned at the inquest.|$|E
