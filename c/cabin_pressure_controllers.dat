2500|$|Bleed air {{produced}} by gas turbine engines is compressed air that {{is taken from}} the compressor stage of those engines, which is upstream of the fuel-burning sections. In modern airliner engines, two regulator valves (high stage and low stage) turn on and off automatically and are controlled by at least [...] "...two air supply and <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>controllers</b> (ASCPCs) which open and close appropriate valves. Engine bleed air comes from the high stage or low stage engine compressor section. Low stage air is used during high power setting operation, and high stage air is used during descent and other low power setting operations." [...] Bleed air from that system can be utilized for internal cooling of the engine, cross-starting another engine, engine and airframe anti-icing, cabin pressurization, pneumatic actuators, air-driven motors, pressurizing the hydraulic reservoir, and waste and water storage tanks. Some engine maintenance manuals refer to such systems as [...] "customer bleed air". Bleed air is valuable in an aircraft for two properties: high temperature and high pressure (typical values are 200–250°C and 275 kPa (40 PSI), for regulated bleed air exiting the engine pylon for use throughout the aircraft).|$|E

5000|$|All {{exhaust air}} is dumped to {{atmosphere}} via an outflow valve, usually {{at the rear}} of the fuselage. This valve controls the <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> and also acts as a safety relief valve, in addition to other safety relief valves. If the automatic <b>pressure</b> <b>controllers</b> fail, the pilot can manually control the <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> valve, according to the backup emergency procedure checklist. The automatic controller normally maintains the proper <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> altitude by constantly adjusting the outflow valve position so that the cabin altitude is as low as practical without exceeding the maximum pressure differential limit on the fuselage. The pressure differential varies between aircraft types, typical values are between [...] and [...] At 39000 ft, the <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> would be automatically maintained at about 6900 ft (450 ft lower than Mexico City), which is about [...] of atmosphere pressure.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the low {{pressure}} environment of commercial aircraft, hypoxaemia may be common and accentuated in patients with lung or heart disease. Regulations specify a <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> not lower than 750 hPa {{but it is not}} known whether this standard is met. This knowledge is important in determining the hazards of commercial flight for patients and the validity of current flight simulation tests. METHODS: Using a wrist-watch recording altimeter, <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> was recorded at 60 s intervals on 45 flights in Boeing 747 - 400 aircraft with three airlines. A log was kept of aircraft altitude using the in-flight display. Change in <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> during flight, relationship between aircraft altitude and <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> and proportion of flight time with <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> approaching the minimum specified by regulation were determined. RESULTS: Flight duration averaged 10 h. Average <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> during flight was 846 hPa. There was a linear fall in <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> as the aircraft cruising altitude increased. At 10, 300 m (34, 000 ft) <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> was 843 hPa and changed 8 hPa for every 300 m (1000 ft) change in aircraft altitude (r(2) = 0. 993; P < 0. 001). Lowest <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> was 792 hPa at 12 200 m (40, 000 ft) but during only 2 % of flight time was <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> less than 800 hPa. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> is determined only by the engineering of the aircraft and its altitude and {{in the present study was}} always higher than required by regulation. Current fitness-to-fly evaluations simulate cabin conditions that passengers will not experience on these aircraft. There may be increased risks to patients should new or older aircraft operate nearer to the present minimum standard. 5 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The ambient {{conditions}} inside commercial aircraft expose passengers to hypobaric hypoxia often approaching the altitude equivalent of 8, 000 feet (2, 438 m) above sea level. There {{have been reports}} of sudden natural death associated with commercial air travel. The major causes of such natural deaths were cerebro- and cardio-vascular diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to clarify the relationship between <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> and pathophysiological changes in passengers at an airport and during flight. We measured inflight cabin altitude and <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> recorded from a handheld barometer or a commercially available altimeter (Protrek), and also the arterial oxygen saturation (%SpO 2) by Nonin finger pulse oximeters in 31 healthy subjects (22 males and 9 females), over 41 scheduled commercial flights between Tokyo and Fukuoka, in Japan. Holter ECGs for 2 males were also recorded to study autonomic activity, which was evaluated by heart rate variability analysis. Steady state <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> in the 41 flights was 804. 9 ± 38. 3 hPa. %SpO 2 decreased from 97. 0 ± 1. 0 % to 91. 0 ± 2. 7 %. While the <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> was decreasing after takeoff and increasing before landing, RR 50 and HF were significantly higher than before takeoff and during horizontal flight. However, LF/HF showed a decrease at decompression and compression, and increased during steady state lower <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure.</b> These results suggest that hypoxemia and unstability in autonomic nervous system activity may induce vasospasm of the vessels with an endothelial dysfunction in passengers during air travel...|$|R
