5|$|During the 1960s, Vestfoldfly never {{received}} a concession for a regular, scheduled flight from Sandefjord to Oslo. The {{reason was that}} the Skien-based Fjellfly held the concession for the routes from Oslo to Sandefjord, Tønsberg and Skien. Fjellfly never used its landing rights at Sandefjord, but nevertheless still hindered Vestfoldfly from starting a <b>competing</b> <b>route.</b> Skaunfelt eventually split his activity in two, demerging the aviation school and renaming it Den Norske Luftfartsskole, which remained in operation until 1999. The other activity was renamed Norsk Flytjeneste. In 1969, Norsk Flytjeneste and Jotun, a large Sandefjord-based industrial company, established Penguin Air Service, where Norsk Flytjeneste owned 25 percent of the shares. Penguin Air Service company bought a six-seat Piper PA-31 Navajo and started charter services for Jotun. In 1975, Bugge Supplyship also joined the joint venture and a second aircraft was bought. Most of the traffic was for the oil industry to Stavanger.|$|E

During the entire 1960s, the airport company lost money.|$|E
50|$|Progress was {{hampered}} by several financial setbacks, debate over <b>competing</b> <b>routes</b> and parliamentary approval to connect Cairns to Rockhampton and Brisbane {{was not given}} until 1910.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s British Railways {{determined}} that having two <b>competing</b> <b>routes</b> to Greenock was unsustainable, and passenger trains ceased running beyond Kilmacolm in February 1959. The line closed completely to passengers in January 1983.|$|R
25|$|Before the acquisition, {{many of the}} two companies' <b>competing</b> <b>routes</b> overlap each other. In {{order to}} make better use of company resources, many routes were reshuffled. Redundant routes were cancelled, and Octopus card bus-bus {{interchange}} discounts were introduced between routes of both companies.|$|R
25|$|The Faroe route was the airline's most lucrative, with profits 29 {{million in}} 1987. The Cabinet of the Faroe Islands wanted {{a share of}} this and in 1988 they, in {{cooperation}} with Cimber Air, established Atlantic Airways. Maersk protested and stated that as a Danair partner, Cimber could not operate a <b>competing</b> <b>route.</b> But with Cimber only purchasing 25 {{percent of the new}} airline, the clause did not come into effect. Atlantic Airways captured roughly half the market on the route. A large portion of this was new ridership, so Maersk's annual patronage on the route only fell from 100,000 to 80,000. However, the competition made it impossible for either airline to make a profit on the route. The Cimber Air case ended in arbitration and on 27 October 1994 the Maritime and Commercial Court found that Cimber Air had acted disloyally and sentenced them to pay Maersk Air a compensation of DKK35.5 million.|$|E
500|$|Tillingbourne {{was formed}} in 1924 by Vic Smith and George Trice. It was {{initially}} known as Tillingbourne Valley, and operated a single vehicle in a maroon livery from a garage in Chilworth on a service between Guildford and Gomshall. Smith left the company in the late 1920s, and a new route from Guildford to Albury Park was introduced around the same time, with four vehicles owned by 1928. The route to Gomshall was extended to Peaslake, and briefly faced competition from Surrey Hills Motor Services prior to their takeover by Aldershot & District, who withdrew the <b>competing</b> <b>route.</b> The company's garage was rebuilt after being destroyed in a fire along with three of its vehicles in 1928. Tillingbourne was reconstituted as a limited company, Tillingbourne Valley Services Limited, in October 1931.|$|E
500|$|The CLR {{bill was}} one of many {{presented}} for the 1902 parliamentary session (including several for the Hammersmith to City route) and it was examined by another joint committee under Lord Windsor. The proposal received support from the mainline railway companies the route interchanged with and from the C, which had a station at Bank. The London County Council and the City Corporation also supported the plan. The Metropolitan Railway opposed, seeing further competition to its services on the Inner Circle. Questions were raised in Parliament about the safety of tunnelling so close to the vaults of many City banks and the risk that subsidence might cause vault doors to jam shut. Another concern was the danger of undermining the foundations of the Dutch Church in Austin Friars. The Windsor committee rejected the section between Shepherd's Bush and Bank, preferring a <b>competing</b> <b>route</b> from the J. P. Morgan-backed Piccadilly, City and North East London Railway (PC). Without the main part of its new route, the CLR withdrew the City loop, leaving a few improvements to the existing line to be approved in the Central London Railway Act, 1902 on [...] 1902.|$|E
50|$|Though {{not part}} of this route today, the Canal d'Orléans was started in 1682 to connect Orléans, on the Loing River, to the {{northern}} terminus of the Canal de Briare. This would provide <b>competing</b> <b>routes</b> from the Loire river to the Loing river.|$|R
50|$|The {{companies}} had competed extensively, {{with some of}} the bitterest conflicts between British railway companies. <b>Competing</b> <b>routes</b> to the same destinations were built, so many towns in Kent were served by both companies, with a legacy of two stations and services to multiple London termini.|$|R
50|$|Dependent on the {{activity}} of mineral workings, and subject to more modern <b>competing</b> <b>routes,</b> the line closed in stages in the twentieth century, although a short section near South Shields is till extant; today much of the route {{is part of the}} national Sustrans foot and cycle path network.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the coming}} of the {{automobile}} as a common form of travel in the early 20th century, state and national attention was directed to improving roads. Because Grove was unincorporated and had a relatively small minority population at a time when blacks had been disenfranchised {{by the turn of the}} century Virginia constitution and discriminatory practices in voter registration, they had no say over routing of new highways. In the 1920s the new U.S. Route 60 was routed through the community from Williamsburg, displacing some homeowners and businesses. [...] The construction was part of the Good Roads Movement. It bridged Skiffe's Creek into Warwick County to Lee Hall. The state chose this routing rather than a <b>competing</b> <b>route</b> via Halstead's Point in York County (now within the US Naval Weapons Station Yorktown).|$|E
2500|$|The Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway was {{originally}} intended to run on a separate <b>competing</b> <b>route</b> from Winchester to a new station north of the Royal Pier. [...] Deposited plans show the route entering the town from Winchester via a tunnel in Chilworth near the current Chilworth Arms Public house before passing through Lordswood and running down {{the east side of}} Dale Valley. [...] From here it was to pass under Winchester Road, running to the east of the current St James' Park, Southampton through land now occupied by Shirley Junior School, then run south east close to the current Wilton Road to cross to the east of Hill Lane near Archers Road. [...] Construction of an embankment and viaduct commenced to the East of Hill Lane [...] before the scheme was abandoned. [...] The Dell was subsequently built on part of the cleared land between Archers Road and Milton Road [...] and the unused embankment remains behind properties to the East of Hill Lane between Milton Road and Commercial Road. [...] Ultimately the line was connected to the existing London and South Western Railway route at Shawford Junction South of Winchester in 1891, and a separate line into Southampton was never built.|$|E
50|$|A {{directly}} <b>competing</b> <b>route</b> to Brymbo {{was opened}} by the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway in the 1880s. It closed in stages between 1954 and 1970.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} year of operation, the {{consortium}} had carried 750,000 passengers in total. Over the same period, NEX carried 12.5 million people over its network. Despite the introduction of British Coachways' <b>competing</b> <b>routes,</b> NEX's net profit increased by over 50% between 1980 and 1981.|$|R
25|$|Whilst the {{introduction}} of railways (steam or horse powered) generally spelt the end of coach services on directly <b>competing</b> <b>routes,</b> it provided opportunities for feeder coach services as shown on the advertisement for 'The Queen' coach put on between Scarborough, Pickering and Helmsley only {{two months after the}} W opened.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Railways Act 1921, the main line {{railways}} of Great Britain were [...] "grouped"; the Caledonian Railway was a constituent of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) and the North British Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). For the time being there continued to be two <b>competing</b> <b>routes</b> to Aberdeen from the south.|$|R
50|$|March 21, 1968: Merger with Louisville and Nashville Railroad {{announced}} to placate Monon fears of lost business due to L&N's {{acquisition of a}} <b>competing</b> <b>route,</b> the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad.|$|E
50|$|Reading Transport's service also faced {{competition}} from the recently privatised Beeline company. Reading bought the <b>competing</b> <b>route</b> from Beeline in 1991, but passenger numbers continued to fall, and the route continued to lose money despite several cost-cutting measures in 1998. In May 2000 the route was withdrawn, replaced at peak times by an Armchair Passenger Transport service.|$|E
50|$|In November 2009 a new <b>competing</b> <b>route</b> 44 between Central Milton Keynes and Lakes Estate was {{launched}} by coach company On A Mission. It was later extended across Milton Keynes to Wolverton, and {{also included a}} single school bus journey. However, the company collapsed on 2 August 2010 and the route no longer operates. The school bus journey {{was replaced by a}} tendered route.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the publicly stated clauses, the agreement also contained a series of illegal collusions. Maersk and SAS split up the market between them, so they no longer would fly on <b>competing</b> <b>routes.</b> This involved that Maersk Air would withdraw from its Copenhagen services to Stockholm and Geneva. Maersk Air also agreed to—gradually so to not awake suspicion—withdraw from its various codeshare agreements with other airlines than SAS.|$|R
500|$|In 1987 Kelvin made a {{reported}} loss of £3 million, {{leading to the}} closure of the depot at Milngavie. Many of the <b>competing</b> <b>routes</b> introduced in 1986 were withdrawn in July 1987, and 70 vehicles were taken out of service. Two years later both Kelvin and neighbouring Central were severely affected by a strike by 700 of the companies' drivers, caused by the dismissal of four shop stewards.|$|R

50|$|The {{local bus}} {{operations}} of Express Motors were {{taken over by}} Silver Star in 1970. Following bus deregulation in 1986 the company's established routes between Caernarfon and Y Fron faced competition from other operators, but the competing routes proved short-lived. A new <b>competing</b> <b>route</b> in the Nantlle Valley was introduced by Silver Star, and a Bws Gwynedd contract for several routes in Caernarfon was won in 1990.|$|E
50|$|Usage {{and revenue}} were below forecast, {{possibly}} {{because on the}} Dutch side of the nearby frontier, between Bergen op Zoom and Dinteloord, a projected direct four-lane highway towards Rotterdam, has still not been built. The <b>competing</b> <b>route</b> through Belgium to Rotterdam which runs a short distance to the east via Breda was suffering intensified congestion in 2004 due to an upgrade which has subsequently been completed.|$|E
50|$|With bus {{deregulation}} in October 1986, Express Motors re-entered {{the local}} service market. A local route in Caernarfon {{was introduced in}} competition with National Bus Company subsidiary Crosville Cymru May. Contracted work on route 1 (Caernarfon-Blaenau Ffestiniog) was won {{at the same time}} as part of the Bws Gwynedd network. The operations of Maldwyn Jones were acquired in 1989. A <b>competing</b> <b>route</b> between Caernarfon and Bangor was introduced in 1991 but withdrawn after four years.|$|E
50|$|The {{shipping}} industry, {{which had}} flourished through the 1960s and 1970s, began {{a period of}} consolidation in the mid-1990s because of plunging freight rates. Separate shipping companies that had run multiple ads in the paper merged and eliminated <b>competing</b> <b>routes.</b> With {{the rapid growth of}} the Internet in the 1990s, many shipping companies began to switch their ship schedules onto their Web sites, where shippers around the world could access them.|$|R

25|$|Although {{initially}} {{conceived as}} a terminus station, an agreement between the SER and the LBSCR saw Tunbridge Wells West linked by a short spur to the Hastings Line thereby connecting it with the Central station. The spur came about {{as a consequence of}} the intense rivalry between the two railway companies which in 1864 had led to both simultaneously depositing bills before Parliament for <b>competing</b> <b>routes</b> across the south-east. The LBSCR obtained authorisation to construct the Ouse Valley Railway, whilst the SER proposed a new line to Eastbourne.|$|R
50|$|The Leeds and Selby Railway {{offered a}} direct route into Leeds from the east. George Hudson {{had his own}} route into Leeds (through Castleford via the Whitford and Methey Junctions) {{accessed}} via a working arrangement with the North Midland Railway. The Leeds and Selby {{had the potential to}} offer opportunities to rival companies, as well as a <b>competing</b> <b>route</b> to Hudson's. On 9 November 1840 George Hudson arranged a lease of the Leeds and Selby for £17,000 per annum.|$|E
50|$|The {{high cost}} of telegrams through the Eastern Cable Company's system {{provided}} further motivation for a <b>competing</b> <b>route.</b> The proposed Pacific Cable would break the Eastern Cable Company's monopoly and {{lower the cost of}} communication between Britain and Australia. When the Pacific Cable opened, the cost of telegrams reduced to less than half the former rate. The ability to communicate directly with the United States and so access more trade opportunities was another argument in favour of the Pacific Cable.|$|E
50|$|Edmund Denison MP was keen {{to promote}} a faster link from London to York via Doncaster and formed the London and York Railway issuing a {{prospectus}} in May 1844. Early in 1845 he and Hudson had a very public argument on Derby station (about raising capital) resulting in a serious rivalry. Hudson and the Midland Railway opposed the GNR in parliament and his involvement with the Eastern Counties Railway was designed to frustrate the GNR plans and build a <b>competing</b> <b>route</b> via Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire.|$|E
25|$|The ACP's revenue {{projections}} {{are based}} on questionable assumptions about increased canal usage and shippers' willingness to pay higher tolls instead of seeking <b>competing</b> <b>routes.</b> In a bid to attract new business as well as keeping the current customers, the ACP is looking to implement financial incentives in their toll programme, including a loyalty scheme, which are expected to combat the problems raised by increased fees. With the cash flow generated by the expanded canal, investment costs {{are expected to be}} recovered in less than 10 years, and financing could be repaid in approximately eight.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the process}} of {{selecting}} the route and obtaining approval for the freeway began, neighborhood activists proposed an alternate route from the one tentatively proposed. [...] The alternate route would skirt the neighborhood, running near the Houston Ship Channel and Buffalo Bayou. As planning continued, opposition developed over both the original route and a short-lived proposal to make the freeway a tollway. The <b>competing</b> <b>routes</b> remained under study until 1973, when the original route was announced as the recommended alignment. The route {{was approved by the}} Houston-Galveston Area Council, despite appeals from neighborhood activists.|$|R
