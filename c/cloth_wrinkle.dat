40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the first local {{descriptor}} de-signed for dynamic surfaces. A dynamic surface is a sur-face that can undergo non-rigid deformation (e. g., human body surface). Using state-of-the-art technology, details on dynamic surfaces such as <b>cloth</b> <b>wrinkle</b> or facial expres-sion can be accurately reconstructed. Hence, various re-sults (e. g., surface rigidity, or elasticity) could be derived by microscopic categorization of surface elements. We pro-pose a timing-based descriptor to model local spatiotem-poral variations of surface intrinsic properties. The low-level descriptor encodes gaps between local event dynam-ics of neighboring keypoints using timing structure of lin-ear dynamical systems (LDS). We also introduce the bag-of-timings (BoT) paradigm for surface dynamics charac-terization. Experiments are performed on synthesized and real-world datasets. We show the proposed descriptor {{can be used}} for challenging dynamic surface classification and segmentation with respect to rigidity at surface keypoints. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} simulate realistic wrinkles on clothes without fine mesh and large computational overheads. Cloth has very little in-plane deformations, {{as most of the}} deformations come from buckling. This can be looked at as area conservation property of cloth. The area conservation formulation of the method modulates the user defined wrinkle pattern, based on deformation of individual triangle. The methodology facilitates use of small in-plane deformation stiffnesses and a coarse mesh for the numeri-cal simulation, this makes cloth simulation fast and robust. More-over, the ability to design wrinkles (even on generalized deformable models) makes this method versatile for synthetic image genera-tion. The method inspired from <b>cloth</b> <b>wrinkling</b> problem, being ge-ometric in nature, can be extended to other wrinkling phenomena...|$|R
40|$|When {{creating}} a real-time character animation (e. g. for video games), fine grain {{details such as}} <b>cloth</b> <b>wrinkles</b> are very often omitted due to the limitation of available resources. However, we {{believe that they are}} crucial to increase realism, hence user immersion. In this paper, we present a perceptual study of dynamic wrinkles on clothes to show that they indeed have an important impact on realism. The models, animations and textures we used are game realistic and the wrinkling algorithm is fast enough to be used in a game. We have found that parameters influencing the perception of dynamic wrinkles include movement type and speed, viewing angle, and texture colors. Our results should be useful for animators or game designers to help them add wrinkles only where they are necessary, and activate them only when they have an impact on realism...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Most current depth sensors provide 2. 5 D range {{images in}} which depth values are {{assigned}} to a rectangular 2 D array. In this paper we {{take advantage of this}} structured information to build an efficient shape descriptor which is about two orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches, while showing similar performance in several tasks involving deformable object recognition. Given a 2 D patch surrounding a point and its associated depth values, we build the descriptor for that point, based on the cumulative distances between their normals and a discrete set of normal directions. This processing is made very efficient using integral images, even allowing to compute descriptors for every range image pixel in a few seconds. The discriminative power of our descriptor, dubbed FINDDD, is evaluated in three different scenarios: recognition of specific <b>cloth</b> <b>wrinkles,</b> instance recognition from geometry alone, and detection of reliable and informed grasping points.

40|$|Figure 1 : Our method uses a precomputed dataset to {{synthesize}} detailed <b>cloth</b> <b>wrinkles</b> (a) that are layered onto a coarse base simulation (inset). The precomputed datset {{can be used}} {{to synthesize}} wrinkles {{for a wide range of}} poses (b and c). This paper describes a method for animating the appearance of clothing, such as pants or a shirt, that fits closely to a figure’s body. Compared to flowing cloth, such as loose dresses or capes, these types of garments involve nearly continuous collision contact and small wrinkles, that can be troublesome for traditional cloth simulation methods. Based on the observation that the wrinkles in closefitting clothing behave in a predominantly kinematic fashion, we have developed an example-based wrinkle synthesis technique. Our method drives wrinkle generation from the pose of the figure’s kinematic skeleton. This approach allows high quality clothing wrinkles to be combined with a coarse cloth simulation that computes the global and dynamic aspects of the clothing motion. While th...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a method for the prediction of clothing pressure of girdles on the human body. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, we propose to use a standard mannequin dummy to measure the clothing pressure of girdles and from which to predict the pressure on the different human body. An improved mathematical programming method for numerical simulation of <b>cloth</b> <b>wrinkling</b> is investigated. Findings - In general, the prediction equations of the model are effective in estimating the clothing pressure on the human body from the clothing pressure on a standard mannequin dummy. Practical implications - The method may be used by the manufacturers of girdles to test their products on a dummy to see whether the pressure distribution is satisfactory to the targeted group of consumers. It can also be used by consumers to assess the suitability of girdles based on the estimated clothing pressure, which may be predicted from the pressure pre-tested on a dummy and the consumer's body characteristics. Originality/value - Direct measurement of clothing pressure on human body for the evaluation of pressure garments is time consuming, expensive. It is therefore desirable to predict the girdle's pressure instead of the direct measurement on human subjects. The method may be used by manufacturers of girdles as well as by consumers.

40|$|Stereo {{matching}} {{deals with}} recovering quantitative depth {{information from a}} set of input images, based on the visual disparity between corresponding points. Generally most of the algorithms assume that the processed images are rectified. As robotics becomes popular, conducting stereo matching {{in the context of}} cloth manipulation, such as obtaining the disparity map of the garments from the two cameras of the cloth folding robot, is useful and challenging. This is resulted from the fact of the high efficiency, accuracy and low memory requirement under the usage of high resolution images in order to capture the details (e. g. <b>cloth</b> <b>wrinkles)</b> for the given application (e. g. cloth folding). Meanwhile, the images can be unrectified. Therefore, we propose to adapt guided filtering algorithm into the pyramidical stereo matching framework that works directly for unrectified images. To evaluate the proposed unrectified stereo matching in terms of accuracy, we present three datasets that are suited to especially the characteristics of the task of cloth manipulations. By com- paring the proposed algorithm with two baseline algorithms on those three datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach is accurate, efficient and requires low memory. This also shows that rather than relying on image rectification, directly applying stereo matching through the unrectified images can be also quite effective and meanwhile efficien...|$|R

40|$|Cloth has {{traditionally}} been simulated on a static mesh composed of a uniform grid of nodes. Since a coarse mesh cannot generally capture fine <b>wrinkles,</b> realistic <b>cloth</b> simulation relies on a fine grid of nodes that is expensive to simulate. However, fine wrinkles are often localized to relatively small portions of a mesh. We introduce an adaptive method that locally refines <b>cloth</b> where <b>wrinkles</b> tend to appear and simplifies regions where wrinkles have disappeared. Recent work has produced adaptive methods for simple models of cloth and related simulations. This project extends to more sophisticated models of cloth. In particular, this work introduces an adaptive model supporting implicit integration. ...|$|R

We efficiently resolve the emerging detail in the material through adaptive remeshing. We present a technique for simulating plastic deformation in sheets of thin materials, such as crumpled paper, dented metal, and <b>wrinkled</b> <b>cloth.</b> Our simulation uses a framework of adaptive mesh refinement to dynamically align mesh edges with folds and creases. This framework allows efficient modeling of sharp features and avoids bend locking that would be otherwise caused by stiff in-plane behavior. By using an explicit plastic embedding space we prevent remeshing from causing shape diffusion. We include several examples demonstrating that the resulting method realistically simulates the behavior of thin sheets as they fold and crumple...|$|R
40|$|Cloth {{animation}} is a {{very expensive}} process in terms of computational cost, due to the flexible nature of <b>cloth</b> objects. Since <b>wrinkles</b> and smooth areas co-exist commonly in cloth, {{it is tempting to}} reduce computational cost by avoiding redundant tessellation at the smooth areas. In this paper we present a method for dynamic adaptation of triangular meshes suitable for cloth simulation. A bottom-up approach is used for mesh refinement, which does not require precomputation and storage of multiresolution hierarchy. The hierarchy is constructed in runtime and allows reverting of the refinement locally. Local mesh refinement and simplification are triggered by curvature-induced criterion, where the curvature is estimated using methods of discrete differential geometry. The results presented are the realistic animation of garment worn by a walking mannequin generated with Baraff-Witkin type cloth solver enhanced with the mesh adaptation scheme...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} the self-collision avoidance problem in simulating the dynamic behavior of deformable cloth. It {{is not an}} easy task to simulate realistically the response of cloth in various types of complicated self-collisions. In this paper, the bounding box technique in addition to ordinary pre-checking for collision detection is used to avoid self-collision. Instead of avoiding self-collision of cloth triangles, we relax to avoid the collision of the bounding boxes of cloth triangles. Some constraints are enforced on the vertices of the cloth triangles to prevent their bounding boxes from penetrating in the direction of collision. The experimental results show that the relaxed self-collision avoidance method can create realistic <b>cloth</b> behavior and <b>wrinkling</b> formation processes. Since the types of interaction between bounding boxes are simple, our method is simple but robust in avoiding self-collisions. # 199...|$|R

40|$|Cloth {{animation}} is {{an important}} area of computer graphics due to its numerous applications. However, so far an animation of fast moving <b>cloth</b> with multiple <b>wrinkles</b> {{has been difficult to}} make because of the cloth clump problem. Cloth clumps are the frozen areas where cloth pieces are clustered unnaturally- an obstacle in making a realistic cloth animation. Hence we present a novel cloth collision resolution algorithm which prevents clump formation during fast cloth motions. The goal of our resolution algorithm is to let cloth move swiftly without having any frozen cloth clumps, while preventing any cloth-cloth and rigid-cloth penetrations at any moment of a simulation. The non-penetration status of cloth is maintained without the formation of cloth clumps regardless of the speed of cloth motion. Our algorithm is based on a novel order in the resolution of cloth collisions. Our algorithm can be used with any cloth simulation approach such as spring-masses or finite elements. For the particular types of applications presented in this paper, we use a spring-mass system and we show several realistic simulations involving fast motions that are clump-free...|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{rendering}} and {{the animation}} of realistic virtual environments and characters has progressed {{at a great}} pace, following advances in computer graphics hardware in the last decade. The role of cloth simulation is becoming ever {{more important in the}} quest to improve the realism of virtual environments. The real-time simulation of cloth and clothing is important for many applications such as virtual reality, crowd simulation, games and software for online clothes shopping. A large number of polygons are necessary to depict the highly exible nature of <b>cloth</b> with <b>wrinkling</b> and frequent changes in its curvature. In combination with the physical calculations which model the deformations, the effort required to simulate cloth in detail is very computationally expensive resulting in much diffculty for its realistic simulation at interactive frame rates. Real-time cloth simulations can lack quality and realism compared to their offline counterparts, since coarse meshes must often be employed for performance reasons. The focus of this thesis is to develop techniques to allow the real-time simulation of realistic cloth and clothing. Adaptive meshes have previously been developed to act as a bridge between low and high polygon meshes, aiming to adaptively exploit variations {{in the shape of the}} cloth. The mesh complexity is dynamically increased or refined to balance quality against computational cost during a simulation. A limitation of many approaches is they do not often consider the decimation or coarsening of previously refined areas, or otherwise are not fast enough for real-time applications. A novel edge-based adaptive mesh is developed for the fast incremental refinement and coarsening of a triangular mesh. A mass-spring network is integrated into the mesh permitting the real-time adaptive simulation of cloth, and techniques are developed for the simulation of clothing on an animated character...|$|R
40|$|A {{data-driven}} {{approach for}} real-time processing of clothes, particularly suitable for simulating dresses worn by virtual characters, is proposed. It starts, prior to realtime simulation, by analyzing cloth behavior {{in relation to}} the underlying skeleton movement from a pre-simulated sequence of the cloth obtained using any high quality offline simulators. The idea is to use this analysis to find an optimal combination of physics-based simulation and geometric approximation of the simulator; potentially colliding regions are defined on the cloth such that they will hold true for the skeleton movement that closely matches that of pre-simulated sequence. At runtime, using these analyses, our simulation process provides both visually pleasing results and performance, as long as the motion of the character remains sufficiently close to the original sequence used for the pre-computation. The key contributions of this paper are (1) efficient collision handling that prunes out potentially colliding objects by using the off-line simulation sequence as examples; (2) data-driven fix-up process for the coarse mesh simulation that deduces the gross behavior of the cloth; and (3) geometric approximation of the fine mesh deformation, responsible for details {{in the shape of the}} <b>cloth</b> such as <b>wrinkles.</b> 1...|$|R

However, most current cloth simulation techniques simply use linear and isotropic elastic models with manually selected stiffness parameters. Such simple simulations do not allow differentiating the behavior of distinct cloth materials such as silk or denim, and they cannot model most materials with fidelity to their real-world counterparts. In this paper, we present a data-driven technique to more realistically animate cloth. We propose a piecewise linear elastic model {{that is a good}} approximation to nonlinear, anisotropic stretching and bending behaviors of various materials. We develop new measurement techniques for studying the elastic deformations for both stretching and bending in real cloth samples. Our setup is easy and inexpensive to construct, and the parameters of our model can be fit to observed data with a well-posed optimization procedure. We have measured a database of ten different cloth materials, each of which exhibits distinctive elastic behaviors. These measurements can be used in most cloth simulation systems to create natural and realistic clothing wrinkles and shapes, for a range of different materials...|$|R
