25|$|Along many rivers {{the arid}} {{conditions}} have caused courses to be dammed to provide water for irrigation. These dams have caused concerns {{along with those}} caused by other activities. The Yaqui has been dammed with three large reservoirs along its course. The Río Grande de Santiago has also been dammed including the Aguamilpa dam begun in 1991 and the El Cajón Dam (Mexico) upstream from it. To provide irrigation water for farming the dry basin, the Nazas river was dammed in the 1930s and 40s. This {{has led to the}} former drainage lakes in the area drying up, and soil depletion from the elimination of the river as a source of soil. Due to <b>the</b> <b>continued</b> <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, erosion on the slopes of hillsides has increased.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s the GVWD was {{persistent}} in {{its position}} to keep <b>logging</b> out of <b>the</b> watersheds. Following Cleveland’s death in 1952, many forestry companies began {{to push for}} <b>logging</b> of land <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watersheds for income. They argued that logging of mature forest was necessary for protection of the watersheds against forest fires, insect infestation, and old aged trees. However, {{near the end of}} the decade, the position of <b>the</b> GVWD on <b>logging</b> began to show signs of changing. On December 16, 1958 <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Seymour watershed began to clear land for the new Seymour dam reservoir. The GVRD hired Consolidated Services Ltd, consulting foresters and engineers, to direct operations. By the end of the project, 487 acres were cleared and a five-mile access road was built alongside the eastern portion of the Seymour Reservoir. <b>The</b> cleared <b>logs</b> were sold and brought in around $540,000. In 1960, the GVWD announced plans to continue building a road nine miles further north to the Loch Lomond reservoir in the Seymour watershed. In 1961, 316 acres of forest in the Seymour watershed were logged to prevent a wooly aphid infestation on Balsam tree species from spreading to the rest of the forest. As <b>the</b> decade <b>continued,</b> <b>the</b> case for <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed for the reasons of protection began to strengthen. In 1967, the 1927 GVWD lease agreement (known as the Amending Indenture) with the provincial government was changed to now allow for building of roads and logging of old growth forests in all three watersheds. The timber on the watershed land was to be managed on a sustained yield bases for the purpose of developing, protecting and improving the water-yielding characteristics of the land.|$|R

When <b>the</b> <b>log</b> had got back so far that the saw came out of the cleft which it had made, the man stopped it, and then, with an iron bar, he shifted the position of <b>the</b> <b>log</b> <b>in</b> such a manner that when the carriage should be put in motion, the saw would cut <b>the</b> <b>log</b> <b>in</b> a new place, at a little distance from the other,--a distance just equal to the thickness of the board which they wished to make.|$|R
