Washington 2 ̆ 7 s justification for bringing this case to the WTO comes from Section 301 of the U. S. trade act, which allows for disputes to be undertaken if U.

Why, then, would the United States involve itself in this European-Caribbean-Latin American dispute? It is the contention of this thesis that the United States thrust itself headlong into this debate for two reasons: domestically, the United States Trade Representative came under pressure, via the White House and Congress, from Chiquita CEO Carl Lindner, who in the past decade donated more than 7. 1 million to American politicians to take the case to the WTO. Internationally, the United States used the case as an opportunity to assert its power over Europe, with the Eastern Caribbean islands being caught in the economic crossfire.

40|$|A {{considerable}} body {{of evidence}} has now demonstrated positive correlations between grandparental presence and child health outcomes. It is typically assumed that such correlations exist because grandparental investment in their grandchildren improves child health and wellbeing. However, less is known about how grandparents allocate help to adult children and grandchildren, particularly in lower income contexts. Here we use detailed quantitative data from the longitudinal Indonesia Family Life Survey (data collected in 1993, 1997, 2000, 2007; n = 16, 250) to examine grandparental help in a society transitioning both demographically and economically. We test the hypothesis that grandparents direct help preferentially towards those adult children and grandchildren {{most in need of}} help. This hypothesis was supported for help provided by married grandparents and single grandmothers, who tended to: provide more help to their adult children when this generation had young children themselves, provide financial help if their adult children were poorer, and provide more household help if their adult daughters worked outside the home. One unexpected result was that help from maternal and paternal grandparents is positively correlated; if one set of grandparents is helping the other set is more likely to help, counter to our predictions. These results provide support for the hypothesis that grandparents preferentially invest in some descendants over others, where married grandparents and single grandmothers tend to invest in those adult children and grandchildren with the most need. Investigating the effect of grandparents on child health outcomes may therefore be confounded by grandparent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>preferential</b> investment in needier descendants...|$|R
40|$|The Author {{examines}} the Supreme Court’s use of “preferential judicial activism”—whereby justices {{decide whether to}} formalistically dismiss cases or instead choose to engage judicial activism based on their policy preferences—through contrasting the Court’s reasoning in Shelby v. Holder with its decisions in cases concerning national security. In Shelby, the majority characterized the Court’s review of the Voting Rights Act of 2006 as necessary given the fundamental rights at stake and the unusually broad reach of the Act in mandating federal jurisdiction over voting matters. However, in national security-related cases in which plaintiffs have alleged violations of fundamental rights, the Court’s response has been a rigid and formalistic refusal to address the plaintiffs’ claims, usually based on the acceptance of government invocations of procedural barriers to litigation. This judicial formalism has consistently led to the dismissal of cases alleging serious government abuse in the post-September 11 context. The Author argues that these instances of judicial formalism illustrate the judiciary’s internal struggle to determine its appropriate role when confronted with questions of constitutional rights during times of war or perceived emergency. Ultimately, taking this dynamic together with Shelby 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>preferential</b> judicial activism and its undermining of voter protections for racial minorities, {{it becomes clear that}} multiple reforms must be undertaken to protect individual rights. The Author concludes that Congress should better assert its role to protect the civil rights of vulnerable populations through passing additional legislation and that courts must acknowledge their own ongoing preferential judicial activism...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} the pari passu {{principle}} of insolvency law (which provides that the creditors {{of a company}} in liquidation are to be paid rateably), and to ask how it relates to other principles available {{for the treatment of}} claims in corporate liquidation. The discussion reveals that the principle has rather limited effect in governing distributions of the insolvent 2 ̆ 7 s estate. Not only do various types of secured claim fall beyond its ambit, even unsecured claims are often exempt from its application. Nevertheless, the principle thrives both in judicial rhetoric and in academic arguments. For example, many a challenge to the different priorities accorded to different types of claim in a company 2 ̆ 7 s insolvency begins with an incantation of the pari passu principle. Commentators see an inherent tension between the 2 ̆ 7 two fundamental principles of credit and insolvency law 2 ̆ 7, that of the freedom of contract which allows one to bargain for priority, and the mandatory pari passu principle. The pari passu principle is said to be 2 ̆ 7 the foremost principle in the law of insolvency around the world 2 ̆ 7. It is thought to be 2 ̆ 7 all-pervasive 2 ̆ 7, and its effect is to 2 ̆ 7 strike down all agreements which have as their object or result the unfair preference of a particular creditor by removal from the estate on winding up of an asset that would otherwise have been available for the general body of creditors. 2 ̆ 7 The principle is said to be supported both by the need for an orderly liquidation of insolvents 2 ̆ 7 estates, and by requirements of fairness. So {{it is not surprising that}} its invocation as the starting point for, say, the debate on the priority of secured or <b>preferential</b> <b>claims,</b> weights the argument in a particular way. Since the pari passu principle has been recognised so widely and for so long as vital, and since it serves such desirable aims as orderliness in liquidation and fairness to all creditors, any deviation from it must be a cause for concern. On this view, the priority (say) of secured or <b>preferential</b> <b>claims</b> is an abnormality, a pathology to be diagnosed and controlled, perhaps even 2 ̆ 7 cured 2 ̆ 7. Since 2 ̆ 7 equality 2 ̆ 7 is the norm, the onus must be on those supporting differing priorities to justify their claim. To the extent that their efforts are unpersuasive, the case for priority must be considered not established, and the 2 ̆ 7 default principle 2 ̆ 7 of 2 ̆ 7 equality 2 ̆ 7 must prevail. This paper seeks to overturn this order of things. It is suggested the pari passu principle does not constitute an accurate description of how the assets of insolvent companies are in fact distributed, has no role to play in ensuring an orderly winding up of such companies, does not explain or justify distinctive features of the formal insolvency regime, and has little to do with fairness in liquidation. The actual role of the principle, it is argued, is merely to provide a low-cost method for dealing with those types of claim which both Parliament and commercial parties themselves have decided should receive little or nothing in most insolvencies. The principle, long regarded as the core distributional principle in corporate liquidation, is more properly understood as a principle of non-distribution. To the extent that these arguments succeed, the initial onus of justifying their position shifts from those arguing in favour of the priority of secured credit, to those who support a more 2 ̆ 7 equal 2 ̆ 7 distribution of the insolvent 2 ̆ 7 s estate...|$|R
