40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE. This {{is a case}} control {{study that}} {{has been carried out}} to assess the {{efficacy}} of platform switching restoration versus traditional abutment connection in single implants over a period of 12 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Radiographic bone levels around implants were compared between the platform switching group and the group with normal diameter abutments using periapical radiography after a year. RESULTS. The results suggest that average bone loss after a year in the platform switching group is 0. 65 mm (SD 0. 5), whereas in the control group the average value of bone loss is 1. 875 mm (SD 0. 5). CONCLUSIONS. Bone crest remodelling is one of the long term success criteria of a dental implant. Some studies show that a year after prosthetic restoration, bone <b>crest</b> <b>levels</b> are 1. 5 - 2 mm under the implant abutment junction. Recently some researchers suggested that smaller diameter abutments allow for a reduction of bone resorption in submerged implants. Although the study was limited, the results showed that platform switching technique causes a smaller bone loss than traditional abutment...|$|R
40|$|As a {{response}} to ongoing sea <b>level</b> rise, <b>crest</b> <b>levels</b> of sea defences need to be raised in future at huge expenditure and with increased risk. As an alternative, dikes can be strengthened as to accommodate for increased wave overtopping. Within the ComCoast program (a European project between governments along the North Sea for innovative solutions {{for the safety of}} sea defences) research has been done on overtopping-resistant sea defences and ideas for different types of reinforcements have been generated. A concept with a specific geosynthetic that reinforces the crest and inner slope of the dikes was awarded for installation at a sea dike in the Netherlands in 2006. The actual field tests took place early 2007. These tests are unique in their kind as they have been carried out on a real dike under full scale wave overtopping conditions, far beyond present standards. As a result, the erosive impact of wave overtopping on the natural grass covered dike section, on the reinforcement section, as well as on a bare clay layer section, has been investigated under representative wave overtopping conditions. This paper describes the results of these field tests, i. e. the strength response of the dike slopes and indicates the follow-up and potentials of the results obtained thus far...|$|R

50|$|December 1861 and January 1862 {{brought about}} devastating floods that placed {{the future of}} the city in doubt. In order to resolve the situation, the city {{residents}} agreed that additional levee construction was necessary. However, the city was divided between camps that supported a relatively small grading of a few feet to raise the city just above the rivers' <b>cresting</b> <b>levels</b> and those that supported a substantial grading to accommodate basements in city businesses. In the upcoming election of 1863, the level at which the city should be raised became a primary factor; a candidate that supported high-level grading won, and high-level grading renovation proceeded. Earth was removed from a dangerous bend nearby the confluence of the two rivers and used to raise city blocks in 1868; the city's sidewalks, until construction was finally finished, were uneven because neighbors of raised city blocks often remained at the pre-construction level. After the filled regions beneath buildings had settled, new streets had to be paved. While planking had been used in the past, newly raised streets chose either the smooth (though indurable) Nicolson pavement or the easily dirtied (though durable) cobblestone pavement. Grading and paving processes were fully completed by 1873, leaving the first floors of many buildings at the time as basements and leaving second floors as new main floors. Today, this system of 19th-century basements is known as the Sacramento Underground.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{clinical}} study was to evaluate the 5 -year results of the first 12 implants inserted at the University of Berne in regenerated bone following successful ridge augmentation with the membrane technique. The patients were recalled and examined with clinical and radiographic parameters routinely utilized in prospective studies with standard implants in non-regenerated bone. Based on clinical and radiographic findings, all 12 implants were considered successfully integrated according to strict criteria of success. The detailed analysis of clinical parameters revealed no differences to results of prospective studies on standard implants in non-regenerated bone. All implants demonstrated ankylotic stability which was confirmed by a mean Periotest value of- 2. 08. The radiographic analysis showed stable bone <b>crest</b> <b>levels</b> with a mean bone loss between the 1 - and 5 -year examination of 0. 30 mm. However, 2 implants exhibited a bone loss of more than 1 mm between the 1 - and 5 -year examination. Therefore, the prognosis of these 2 implants seems questionable at the present time. It can be concluded that bone regenerated with the membrane technique reacts to implant placement like non-regenerated bone, since all 12 implants achieved successful tissue integration with functional ankylosis. Furthermore, this bone is also load-bearing, since all 12 implants maintained osseointegration over a 5 -year period. Copyright Â© Munksgaard 1996. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} was to evaluate the success rate of titanium screw-type implants with the sandblasted and acid-etched (SLA) surface loaded early, after 6 weeks of healing. Material and methods: A total of 104 implants were inserted into posterior sites of 51 partially edentulous patients exhibiting bone densities of class I-III. After a healing period of 6 weeks, all implants were functionally loaded with cemented crowns or fixed partial dentures. The patients were recalled at 3, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months for clinical and radiographic examination. Results: One implant failed to integrate during healing, and three implants were lost to follow-up and were considered drop-outs. The remaining 100 implants showed favorable clinical and radiographic findings at the 5 -year examination. The peri-implant soft tissues were stable over time; the mean probing depths and mean attachment levels did not change during the follow-up period. None of the radiographs exhibited signs of continuous peri-implant radiolucency, which confirmed ankylotic stability for all 100 implants. The measurement of the bone <b>crest</b> <b>levels</b> (DIB values) indicated stability as well. Based on strict success criteria, all 100 implants were considered successfully integrated, resulting in a 5 -year success rate of 99 %. Conclusion: This prospective study using an early loading protocol with 6 weeks of healing demonstrated that titanium implants with the SLA surface can achieve and maintain successful tissue integration with high predictability for at least 5 years of follow-up in selected patients and sites.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with missing mandibular premolars and molars were enrolled in this study. To {{be included in the}} study, the implants had to show good primary stability. Implant stability was measured with resonance frequency analysis using the Osstell device (Integration Diagnostics). Implants were included in the study when the stability quotient (ISQ) exceeded 62. Clinical measurements, such as width of keratinized tissue, ISQ, and radiographic assessment of peri-implant bone <b>crest</b> <b>levels,</b> were performed at baseline and at the 12 -month follow-up. The comparison between the baseline and the 12 -month visits was performed with the Student t test for paired data (statistically significant at a level of alpha = 0. 05). RESULTS: Forty implants with a sandblasted, large grit, acid-etched (SLA) surface (Straumann) were placed in 20 patients. At 12 months, only 1 implant had been lost because of an acute infection. The remaining 39 implants were successful, resulting in a 1 -year success rate of 97. 5 %. Neither peri-implant bone levels, measured radiographically, nor implant stability changed significantly from baseline to the 12 -month follow-up (P >. 05).

40|$|Background Mutations in calcium-responsive transactivator (CREST) {{encoding}} gene {{have been}} recently linked to ALS. Similar to several proteins implicated in ALS, CREST contains a prion-like domain and {{was reported to}} be a component of paraspeckles. Results We demonstrate that CREST is prone to aggregation and co-aggregates with FUS but not with other two ALS-linked proteins, TDP- 43 and TAF 15, in cultured cells. Aggregation of CREST affects paraspeckle integrity, probably by trapping other paraspeckle proteins within aggregates. Like several other ALS-associated proteins, CREST is recruited to induced stress granules. Neither of the CREST mutations described in ALS alters its subcellular localization, stress granule recruitment or detergent solubility; however Q 388 stop mutation results in elevated steady-state levels and more frequent nuclear aggregation of the protein. Both wild-type protein and its mutants negatively affect neurite network complexity of unstimulated cultured neurons when overexpressed, with Q 388 stop mutation being the most deleterious. When overexpressed in the fly eye, wild-type CREST or its mutants lead to severe retinal degeneration without obvious differences between the variants. Conclusions Our data indicate that CREST and certain other ALS-linked proteins share several features implicated in ALS pathogenesis, namely the ability to aggregate, be recruited to stress granules and alter paraspeckle integrity. A change in <b>CREST</b> <b>levels</b> in neurons which might occur under pathological conditions would have a profound negative effect on neuronal homeostasis.
