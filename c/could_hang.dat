5|$|The dromons that Procopius {{describes}} were single-banked {{ships of}} probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger (parexeiresia), these extended {{directly from the}} hull. In the later bireme dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations. Makrypoulias suggests 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast (histos or katartion), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to manoeuvre effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two quarter rudders at the stern (prymnē), which also housed a tent (skēnē) that covered the captain's berth (krab(b)at(t)os). The prow (prōra) featured an elevated forecastle (pseudopation), below which the siphon for the discharge of Greek fire projected, although secondary siphons could also be carried amidships on either side. A pavesade (kastellōma), on which marines <b>could</b> <b>hang</b> their shields, ran around {{the sides of the}} ship, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles (xylokastra) on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms. The bow spur (peronion) was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.|$|E

25|$|A {{suspension}} bridge {{is a type}} of bridge in which the deck, the load-bearing portion, is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders that carry the weight of the deck below, upon which traffic crosses. Primitive in their earliest form, the ancestor to what is now considered a {{suspension bridge}}, the simple suspension bridge, was developed sometime around 2000 BC in China and India, relying upon ropes thrown across a narrow gorge or river, from which people <b>could</b> <b>hang</b> as they crawled across. With the extreme dangers of swinging back and forth, these simple suspension bridges were deemed impractical as horses as well as carriages later found it difficult to maneuver across their wooden planks. The world's first suspension bridge in a modern sense, the Jacob's Creek Bridge at approximately 70 feet in length, was invented by James Finley of Uniontown, Pennsylvania in 1801, who designed vertical towers to elevate the curved iron cables and to stiffen trusses {{in order to make the}} deck of bridges architecturally sound for passing travelers. Nowadays, suspension bridges use steel cables. However, the suspension bridge and its basic, fundamental design of which Finley is duly accredited to inventing, is still evident today in suspension bridges found throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|Belisarius's fleet {{during the}} Vandalic War, as {{described}} by Procopius of Caesarea, was apparently at least partly fitted with lateen sails, making it probable that {{by that time the}} lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon, with the traditional square sail gradually falling from use in medieval navigation. These 6th-century dromons were single-banked ("monoreme") ships of probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger, these extended directly from the hull. In the later two-banked ("bireme") dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the ship's marines in boarding operations. The Greek scholar Christos Makrypoulias suggests an arrangement of 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast (histos or katartion), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to maneuver effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions.

500|$|The Marie Antoinette Suite is {{accessed}} {{from the}} main restaurant. According to Marcus Binney [...] "the gilded detail of the room has the lustre and crispness of gilt bronze, even the egg-and-dart in the boldly modelled cornice". Floral motifs are a common feature of the room, given the namesake, Marie Antoinette, and represents the flowers at one of her feasts. Over the overmantel is a basket of flowers, with [...] "flowers spilling out over the frames of the oval lunettes". [...] In the small entrance lobby of the suite are two terracotta statues of Spring and Summer, with [...] "drum-shaped pedestals ornamented with gilt-bronze flowers and ribbons". The ventilation grilles, of considerable size, are decorated in bronzed lattice. On the walls are a series lamp holders held by miniature Apollo lyres, with each bulb holder containing around 25 leaves opened out. The lights, according to Binney, are hung on [...] "cords from ribbons tied in bows, entwined at intervals with flowers, descending to a cluster of tassels". [...] The panels of the walls are treated like picture frames, with inner and outer mouldings, {{in contrast to the}} window frames and the wall mirrors which are surrounded by [...] "clusters of reeds, with an inset behind which a curtain <b>could</b> <b>hang</b> without obscuring the moulding", according to Binney.|$|E

2500|$|Cinematographer Adam Greenberg, whose {{previous}} film credits included Three Men and a Baby, La Bamba and Near Dark, {{approached the}} film {{with a unique}} documentary-style technique. Commenting on the initial photography lighting tests, Greenberg remarked, [...] "The first ones were a disaster. They didn't look good at all. I didn't know how to photograph these aliens. It {{was the first time}} I had to deal with this kind of thing. But I have an eye and I learned from these tests." [...] At the Biltmore Hotel, a peculiar situation arose where the ceilings were simply too tall for standard lighting equipment. An ingenious idea was devised by the crew to have six to eight weather balloons sent up and have artificial light bounce off of them to create the proper lighting mood. Greenberg remarked, [...] "I wanted a very rich look from that place, gold and very warm. In the story it is very late after a big party. I wasn't going for any special effect, just nice light from lamps on the tables. The problem was, the hotel management wouldn't let us hang anything from the ceiling. In pre-production they had told us we <b>could</b> <b>hang</b> lights, but I didn't believe them. The ceilings there are very high and very beautiful." ...|$|E

[...] Lukáš Redl of Medium wrote that it was {{possible}} to construct an audience around the concept of a virtual motor race and noted people approved of it. He wrote that the sim racing industry needed to adapt to a new strategy and put their focus on eSports, [...] "It is actually quite a rare example in eSports as most disciplines are not based on making things as real as possible.

[...] Writing for Alphr, Curtis Moldrich echoed similar statements and believed the positive consequence of the Vegas eRace was a testament on how Formula E is forward-looking. He felt Formula One would not be able to negotiate all of their drivers into undertaking a similar event. Autosport's Scott Mitchell called the event [...] " an enormous middle finger to the traditionalists", and although he believed another eRace was unlikely to be repeated on a large scale, he wrote it was [...] "huge for a hidden part of motorsport that Formula E has taken that chance" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Byzantine navy, {{the largest}} Mediterranean war fleet {{throughout}} most of the early Middle Ages, employed crescent formations with the flagship in the center and the heavier ships at the horns of the formation, in order to turn the enemy's flanks. Similar tactics are believed to have been employed by the Arab fleets they frequently fought from the 7th century onwards. The Byzantines were the first to employ Greek fire, a highly effective incendiary liquid, as a naval weapon. It could be fired through a metal tube, or siphon mounted in the bows, similar to a modern flame thrower. The properties of Greek fire were close to that of napalm and was a key to several major Byzantine victories. By 835, the weapon had spread to the Arabs, who equipped harraqas, [...] "fireships", with it. The initial stages in naval battles was an exchanges of missiles, ranging from combustible projectiles to arrows, caltrops and javelins. The aim was not to sink ships, but to deplete the ranks of the enemy crews before the boarding commenced, which decided the outcome. Once the enemy strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and upper bank oarsmen boarded the enemy vessel and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Byzantine dromons had pavesades, racks along the railings, on which marines <b>could</b> <b>hang</b> their shields, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles on either side between the masts, which allowed archers to shoot from an elevated firing position.|$|E

2500|$|Tomb of the Unknowns marble was quarried {{in seven}} pieces for four layers; cap, die, base and {{sub-base}} (plinth) from Quarry 3 at [...] below the opening from early in 1930 to January 1931. The cap was quarried {{on the first try}} while the base required three attempts. [...] (No data available as to quarrying the plinth). The die was worked by 75 men for one year and three attempts until a 56-ton (55.86 metric) block came out of the quarry in late January 1931. [...] When the block was cut from the mountain it weighed 124 tons (123.69 metric). [...] A wire saw was then brought in to cut the block down to 56 tons (55.68 metric). [...] Because of the weight, Vermont Marble Company sent to the quarry a special derrick that was reinforced and heavily rigged. The initial lift was just enough to clear the quarry floor so the block <b>could</b> <b>hang</b> for 15 minutes while the hoist was inspected for stress. [...] Once out of the quarry, the trip to down to Marble took four days with the die block arriving {{on the grounds of the}} mill site on 3 February 1931.

[...] The work was completed in September and arrived at Arlington National Cemetery the same month. [...] Assembly started in September but after the base piece was put in place, imperfections were discovered halting the work until a replacement was received. [...] Three attempts were made before an acceptable piece was quarried. [...] In December, the replacement base arrived and the assembly was completed 31 December 1931. [...] This was followed by the carving work on the die block by the Piccirilli Brothers (who also carved the statue of Lincoln for the Lincoln Memorial) under the supervision of Tomb sculptor William Hudson Jones. When the Tomb assembly was completed 9 April 1932, the structure had the following dimensions.|$|E
