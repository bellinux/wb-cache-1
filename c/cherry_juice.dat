40|$|This {{study is}} the first report on the {{antibacterial}} effect of Hungarian sour cherry cultivars. Biological activity of sour <b>cherry</b> <b>juices</b> prepared from fruits Érdi jubileum, Érdi bőtermő, Maliga emléke and Kántorjánosi 3 harvested at different maturity stages was investigated on bacteria present in human saliva. The influence of sour cherry on a mixed bacterial flora of human saliva of 10 volunteers was determined by different experimental approaches. Bactericidal effects were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using agar diffusion methods and by minimum bactericidal dilution (MBD) assays {{counting the number of}} surviving bacterial cells in the diluted juices. Time-dependent antibacterial effects were also determined by monitoring the decrease in bacterial cell numbers after the treatment with undiluted juices. The investigated sour <b>cherry</b> <b>juices</b> displayed an impressive bactericidal effect against human saliva bacteria (10 – 100 × reduction of cell numbers) within a short time frame (10 – 40 min). Érdi jubileum was more effective (100 000 × reduction of cell number after 270 min) than the other studied cultivars. Bactericidal effect was influenced by ripening of samples of Érdi jubileum obtained at different harvesting dates. Biologically active components were effective against a large spectrum of opportunistic bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Pantoea spp. and Escherichia coli, including the antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa but they were ineffective against beneficial probiotic Lactobacillus spp. Results confirmed the antibacterial potential of all the investigated sour cherry fruits, therefore the consumption of the fruit or its juice for positive influence on oral hygiene is highly recommended...|$|R

40|$|Informações sobre a composição de alimentos nacionais são escassas. Sucos concentrados de frutas são amplamente utilizados por famílias brasileiras. No presente trabalho foram determinados oito elementos minerais (K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn) com importância nutricional em sucos concentrados comerciais de frutas nacionais, abacaxi (3 marcas), acerola (2 marcas), caju (5 marcas), goiaba (3 marcas), manga (2 marcas), maracujá (5 marcas) e pitanga (1 marca) por espectrometria de absorção atômica com atomização em chama. A contribuição nutricional dos sucos para a dieta de crianças após a diluição recomendada pelo fabricante e considerando a ingestão diária de um copo de 300 mL é elevada quanto a potássio para todos os sucos examinados (170 - 930 % da ingestão diária recomendada, RDA). Os sucos de abacaxi e acerola podem fornecer 6 e 12 % da RDA de ferro, respectivamente. O manganês aparece em abacaxi, manga, goiaba e acerola com 38, 14, 8 e 7 % do RDA, respectivamente. Magnésio varia entre um máximo de 9 % do RDA em abacaxi e 2 % em maracujá e caju. Zinco e cobre variaram entre menos de 1 - 2 % do RDA em sucos de caju e pitanga, a 2 - 6 % nos outros sucos. Para adultos as contribuições são proporcionalmente menores, porém em nada desprezíveis. Information on the {{composition}} of Brazilian foods is scant. Concentrate fruit juices commercialized in glass bottles are widely used by Brazilian families. The present work eight nutritionally important elements (K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn) in commercial concentrated fruit juices, pineapple (3 brands), West Indian cherry (2 brands), cashew (5 brands), guava (3 brands), mango (2 brands), passion fruit (5 brands), and Surinam cherry (1 brand) were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The juices contribution to children's diet, considering an intake of 300 mL per day and using the dilution suggested by the maker, is high in potassium for all juices analyzed (170 - 930 % of the recommended daily allowance, RDA). The pineapple and West Indian <b>cherry</b> <b>juices</b> offer 6 and 12 % of the iron RDA, respectively.

40|$|Sour <b>cherry</b> <b>juices</b> {{made from}} two sour cherry cultivars (Érdi bőtermő and Kántorjánosi 3, were {{investigated}} {{to determine their}} total anthocyanin content and half-life of anthocyanins during heat treatment at different temperatures (70, 80 and 90 °C) for 4 h. Before the heat treatment, Érdi bőtermő juice had higher anthocyanin concentration (812 mg/L) than Kántorjánosi 3 juice (513 mg/L). The greatest heat sensitivity of anthocyanins was measured at 90 °C, while the treatments at 80 and 70 °C caused lower thermal degradation. The loss of anthocyanins in Érdi bőtermő juice after treatment was 38, 29 and 18 %, respectively, while in Kántorjánosi 3 juice losses of 46, 29 and 19 % were observed, respectively. At 90 °C sour <b>cherry</b> Érdi bőtermő <b>juice</b> had higher half-life (t 1 / 2) of anthocyanins, while the Kántorjánosi 3 juice had higher t 1 / 2 values at 70 °C. Cyanidin- 3 -glucosyl-rutinoside was present in higher concentrations in both cultivars (Érdi bőtermő: 348 and Kántorjánosi 3 : 200 mg/L) than cyanidin- 3 -rutinoside (177 and 121 mg/L) before treatment. However, during the experiment, cyanidin- 3 -rutinoside was {{proved to be more}} resistant to heat. Comparing the two varieties, both investigated pigment compounds were more stable in Kántorjánosi 3 than in Érdi bőtermő.

40|$|Background and Aim: Foodstuffs {{additives}} are {{a general}} term for {{materials that are}} added to the foodstuffs in order to increase durability and to improve the appearance, composition, taste and food nutritional value. Colors are classified in this group and are added to foodstuffs in order to increase their attraction. The aim of this survey was to analyze status of added colors to the <b>juice</b> of black <b>cherry</b> and <b>juice</b> of barberry which are produced in Tehran City, capital of Iran. Materials and Methods: Three haundred thirty six samples of dried sweets were randomly collected and analyzed from different areas of Tehran. First, the samples were de-colored by Clorhidric Acid, and then were analyzed after refining by Thin Layer Chromatography (T. L. C) method. Results: Eighty nine percent from the total samples contained colors. Among chromatic samples, 62 samples (18. 5 %) out the total samples, contained artificial, non-edible colors and 237 samples (70. 5 %) from the total samples contained artificial and edible colors (for Industrial Producers) and 37 samples (11 %), contained natural colors. Carmoisine color was detected more than added colors in <b>juice</b> of black <b>cherry</b> and <b>juice</b> of barberry. Conclusion: Low costs, stability, Ph and similarity of artificial dyes with natural dyes motivate the producers for high utilization of these dyes without considering their possible hazards and/or their edible quality aspects...|$|R

Increase in carrier mass per volume ratio resulted in lower moisture content and powder hygroscopicity, higher bulk density, solubility and product yield.

PME and PG inactivation followed first order kinetics at all conditions tested. Pressure and temperature acted antagonistically as far as PME inactivation is concerned, while they had a synergistic effect in most pressure-temperature combinations on PG inactivation. A slight increase in red color and lycopene content of tomato juice after high pressure processing was observed. Processing allowing total PG but partial PME inactivation resulted in juice with higher viscosity within the processes examined...|$|R
