40|$|A cassava stem {{cutting unit}} was {{developed}} to generate the design data for its use on a prototype of a cassava planter. It consisted of a 25. 5 cm circular saw blade, cam mechanism, bottom plate, electric motor (0. 75 kW) to operate saw blade and a motor (0. 37 kW). The cassava stems were fed manually into a feeding chute for free fall on to the bottom plate, and then these were cut by the circular saw operated by an electric motor. The cam mechanism operated by the cam motor, controlled the number of cuts by the circular saw. The cutting length could be adjusted between 15 and 30 cm by altering {{the position of the}} bottom plate. Test results indicated that the highest cutting quality of this unit at more than 60 number of circular saw teeth when operated at faster than 1, 200 rpm <b>cutting</b> <b>shaft</b> speed and slower than 50 rpm cam shaft speed. Cutting capacity depended on cam shaft speed. At 50 rpm cam shaft speed, minimum cutting capacity was found to be 5, 034 stakes per hour (40, 272 stakes per day of 8 h) with 83. 91 % cutting efficiency. The stems were undamaged when operated at these conditions and showed satisfactory germination performance...|$|E

The conventional raise boring methods, such as the wood support method, the hanging cage method, the creeping cage method, and the deep-hole blasting method, are analyzed and compared. In addition, the raise boring machines are classified into different types and the characteristics of each type are described. The components of a raise boring machine including the drill rig, the drill string and the auxiliary system are also presented. Based on the analysis of the raise boring method, the rock mechanics problems during the raise boring process are put forward, including rock fragmentation, removal of <b>cuttings,</b> <b>shaft</b> wall stability, and borehole deviation control. Finally, the development trends of raise boring technology are described as follows: (i) improvement of rock-breaking modes to raise drilling efficiency, (ii) development of an intelligent control technique, and (iii) development of technology and equipment for nonlinear raise boring...|$|R

In this study, the surface roughness, cutting force, and tool wear were experimentally investigated in order to clarify the cutting performance of the turning insert with a three-arcs-shaped finishing edge. The machined surface of the insert with a three-arcs-shaped finishing edge was better than that of the normal insert. The wear progress of the insert with an arc-shaped finishing edge was slightly slower than that of the normal insert. The cutting force of the insert with an arc-shaped finishing edge was almost the same as that of the normal insert...|$|R
40|$|Typically, for {{automotive}} shafts, shape distortion {{manifests itself}} in most cases after the induction hardening by an effect known as bending. The distortion results in a boost of costs, especially due to machining parts in the hardened state to fabricate its final tolerances. In the present study, residual stress measurements were carried out on automotive drive shafts made of DIN 38 B 3 steel. The samples were selected in consequence of their different distortion properties by an industrial manufacturing line. One tested shaft was straightened, because of the considerable dimensional variation {{and the other one}} not. Firstly, the residual stress measurements were carried out by using a portable difractometer, in order to avoid <b>cutting</b> the <b>shafts</b> and evaluate the original state of the stresses, and afterwards a more detailed analysis was realized by a conventional stationary diffractometer. The obtained results presented an overview of the surface residual stress profiles after induction hardening and displayed the influence of the straightening process on the redistribution of residual stresses.

40|$|The Mediterranean {{fruit fly}} (or medfly), Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae), affects {{most of the}} fruit species grown in {{temperate}} and tropical climate regions, causing significant economic damage. One of the classical cultural strategies against this pest is to gather and bury the remaining fruit after harvest, but this is economically unfeasible today. Wood shredders already available in current Spanish groves {{can be used to}} grind or crush fruits laying on the soil as an alternative to this practice and to the use of pesticides in area-wide integrated pest management (IPM). With the purpose of evaluating this alternative, the initial step {{of this study was to}} perform laboratory tests to assess the efficacy of crushing and grinding as a method for controlling medflies. The results showed that grinding was 78 % effective against larval stages, while crushing resulted in a 17 % efficacy, leading us to choose the first alternative. As a second step, the operational parameters (type of <b>cutting</b> tool, <b>shaft</b> rotation speed and tractor speed) of the wood shredders were adjusted to efficiently carry out this practice under field conditions. Finally, the effect of the mechanised grinding of fallen fruit on C. capitata populations was evaluated for two consecutive years in commercial citrus orchards.

50|$|A sword {{tempered}} {{this way}} cannot usually {{have an edge}} as hard as a differentially-hardened sword, like a katana, {{because there is no}} softer metal directly underneath the edge to back-up the harder metal. This makes the edge more likely to chip away in larger pieces. Therefore, such an extremely hard edge is not always desirable, as greater hardness makes the edge more brittle and less resistant to impacts, such as <b>cutting</b> through bones, <b>shafts</b> of pole-arms, hitting shields or blocking and parrying. The sword will often be tempered to slightly higher temperatures to increase the impact resistance at a cost in the ability to hold a sharp edge when cutting. The edge may need to be tempered to dark-straw or brown to achieve this, and the center tempered to a blue or purple color. This leaves very little difference between the edge and the center, and the benefits of this method, over tempering the sword evenly at a point somewhere in the middle, may not be very substantial. When a sword tempered in this way is resharpened the hardness will decrease with each sharpening, although the reduction in hardness will usually not be noticeable until a large amount of steel has been removed.|$|R

Here is {{the door of}} the Baptistery at Pisa, again by Mr. Severn delightfully enlarged for us from a photograph. [1] The general idea of it is a square-headed opening in a solid wall, faced by an arch carried on shafts. And the ornament does indeed follow this construction so that the eye catches it with ease,--but under what arbitrary conditions! In the square door, certainly the side-posts of it are as important members as the lintel they carry; but the lintel is carved elaborately, and the side-posts left blank. Of the facing arch and shaft, it would be similarly difficult to say whether the sustaining vertical, or sustained curve, were the more important member of the construction; but the decorator now reverses the distribution of his care, adorns the vertical member with passionate elaboration, and runs a narrow band, of comparatively uninteresting work, round the arch. Between this outer shaft and inner door is a square pilaster, of which the architect carves one side, and lets the other alone. It is followed by a smaller shaft and arch, in which he reverses his treatment of the outer order by <b>cutting</b> the <b>shaft</b> delicately and the arch deeply. Again, whereas in what is called the decorated construction of English Gothic, the pillars would have been left plain and the spandrils deep cut,--here, are we to call it decoration of the construction, when the pillars are carved and the spandrils left plain? Or when, finally, either these spandril spaces {{on each side of the}} arch, or the corresponding slopes of the gable, are loaded with recumbent figures by the sculptors of the renaissance, are we to call, for instance, Michael Angelo's Dawn and Twilight, only the decorations of the sloping plinths of a tomb, or trace to a geometrical propriety the subsequent rule in Italy that no window could be properly complete for living people to look out of, without having two stone people sitting on the corners of it above?

The walls of the box body are 40 -mm-thick steel plate welded into a tight complete structure, with a cover plate thickness of 60 Â mm, and the design pressure is 6 Â MPa. The primary boxâs length, width and height are 1600, 1200 and 1200 Â mm, respectively. The maximum experimental coal sample mass is about 1200 Â kg. The front and rear surfaces of the main box body contain 24 holes with different height distributions in three layers; 23 of these have a 14 Â mm diameter for conveying sensor cables and the remaining holes with 12 Â mm diameters are standard screw drills for gas injection. A special high-pressure hose {{is connected to the}} external side, and the holeâs internal side is connected with a cribriform ventilation device {{at the bottom of the}} primary box (Fig.Â  2 b). The cribriform ventilation device is designed as a cribriform pectinate strip. The height of the pectinate strip is 20 Â mm, and the upper surface of the strip contains well-distributed ventilation holes.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the degree of eccentricity between different tungsten carbide bur manufacturing techniques and to study the effect of bur inaccuracy on dental enamel. Error in bur concentricity may arise from malalignment of the steel shaft and carbide head in a two-piece construction bur. Cutting blades rotate at multiple radii from the shaft axis, potentially producing vibrations and damage to the cut substrate. Techniques now allow for the manufacture of one-piece tungsten carbide burs with strength adequate to withstand lateral loading. A comparison of tungsten carbide dental cutting tools revealed the true extent of concentricity errors. Variation in alignment of the <b>cutting</b> head and <b>shaft</b> in the two-part constructions incurred between 20 and 50 pm of additional axial error. High-speed cutting interactions with dental enamel between carbide burs were studied {{by means of a}} video-rate confocal microscope. A cutting stage fitted to a Tandem Scanning Microscope (TSM) allowed for real-time dynamic image acquisition. Images were captured and retrieved by means of a low-light-level camera recording directly to S-VHS videotape. Videotape showing the interactions of high-speed rotary cutting instruments (at 120, 000 rpm) were taken under simulated normal wet-cutting environments, and the consequent damage to the tooth tissue was observed as it occurred. Concentrically engineered bur types produced a superior quality cut surface at the entry, exit, and advancing front aspects of a cavity, as well as less subsurface cracking. Imaging of the coolant water film local to recent cutting operations showed regular spherical cutting debris of 6 to 18 pm diameter from the concentric tools, whereas the less-well-engineered burs produced ragged, irregular chips, with 25 - 40 pm diameter debris, indicating far more aggressive cutting actions. This study has shown that there is reduced substrate damage with high-concentricity carbide burs...|$|R

The long axes of the elliptical pillars are generally oriented to the north. Northwards-oriented side buttresses also are associated {{with some of the}} pillars. The internal architecture of the pillars is characterized by intense bioturbation with two different burrowing styles. Type 1 burrows are composed of a network of randomly oriented, anastomosing sandstone-filled tubes, 0. 3 to 0. 8 cm in diameter. Type 2 burrows are rare, north-south oriented, and have a smaller diameter. Other associated features are back-filled tubes, open, vertical shafts, and open spaces between the interior and exterior of the pillars. The pillars are interpreted as fossilized termite nests. Type 1 burrows are interpreted as termite passageways within the nest. Type 2 burrows may be related to invading ants. Back-filled burrows may be a result of either beetle predation on resident termites or backfilling by termites themselves. The strong north-south orientations are comparable with modern-day nest architecture of magnetic termites in northern Australia, where nest-orientation is related to cooling. The orientations and features reported here are interpreted to be modified for the high latitudes proposed for the Lower Jurassic Clarens desert. Complex nest architecture preserved in the Clarens Formation suggests that advanced eusocial behavior and ability to construct large nests had appeared in African termites by the Early Jurassic.
