Methods: Cross-sectional data on height and sitting height were collected from 14 500 children of Dutch origin in the age range 0 - 21 years. Reference SD charts were constructed by the LMS method. Correlations were analysed in three age groups. SH/H data from patients with Marfan syndrome and genetically confirmed hypochondroplasia were compared with height corrected SH/H references. Results: A positive association was observed between H SDS, SH SDS, and LL SDS in all age groups. There was a negative correlation between SH/H SDS and height SDS. In short children with a height SDS <- 2 SDS, a cut-off limit of + 2. 5 SD leads to a more acceptable percentage of false positive results. In exceptionally tall children, a cut-off limit of - 2. 2 SDS can be used. Alternatively, a nomogram of SH/H SDS versus H SDS can be helpful. The sensitivity of the height corrected <b>cut-off</b> <b>lines</b> for hypochondroplasia was 80 % and for Marfan syndrome only 30 %. Conclusions: In exceptionally short or tall children, the dependency of the SH/H ratio (SDS) on height SDS {{has to be taken}} into consideration in the evaluation of body proportions.

2500|$|These {{organizations}} have a similarly long pedigree on the Minnesota campus. Historically, they are grouped with the undergraduate social fraternities {{because of their}} use of chapter and national organizational hierarchy, and their use of Greek Letters. [...] Most are organized toward juniors and seniors, or graduate students. [...] Social/academic fraternity or sorority membership is not a requirement for these groups. Individuals who meet the criteria may join or be asked to join, as may non-Greek students. [...] Multiple affiliations may be allowable - see individual societies for details. [...] Activity varies; some of the professional and service groups are residential, while the honors societies may meet only quarterly or annually, if at all.

2500|$|As {{described}} in the [...] section, Isabel Myers considered {{the direction of the}} preference (for example, E vs. I) to be more important than the degree of the preference. Statistically, this would mean that scores on each MBTI scale would show a bimodal distribution with most people scoring near the ends of the scales, thus dividing people into either, e.g., an extraverted or an introverted psychological type. However, most studies have found that scores on the individual scales were actually distributed in a centrally peaked manner, similar to a normal distribution, indicating that the majority of people were actually {{in the middle of the}} scale and were thus neither clearly introverted nor extraverted. Most personality traits do show a normal distribution of scores from low to high, with about 15% of people at the low end, about 15% at the high end and the majority of people in the middle ranges. But in order for the MBTI to be scored, a <b>cut-off</b> <b>line</b> is used at the middle of each scale and all those scoring below the line are classified as a low type and those scoring above the line are given the opposite type. Thus, psychometric assessment research fails to support the concept of type, but rather shows that most people lie near the middle of a continuous curve. [...] "Although we do not conclude that the absence of bimodality necessarily proves that the MBTI developers' theory-based assumption of categorical [...] "types" [...] of personality is invalid, the absence of empirical bimodality in IRT-based research of MBTI scores does indeed remove a potentially powerful line of evidence that was previously available to [...] "type" [...] advocates to cite in defense of their position." ...|$|E
