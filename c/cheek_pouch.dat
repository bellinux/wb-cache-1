5|$|In many species, the molars are {{relatively}} large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups {{differ in the}} arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. The <b>cheek</b> <b>pouch</b> is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth {{to the front of the}} shoulders. True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region.|$|E

5000|$|Like {{most members}} of the subfamily, the golden hamster has {{expandable}} <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches,</b> which extend from its cheeks to its shoulders. In the wild, hamsters are larder hoarders; they use their <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> to transport food to their burrows. Their name in the local Arabic dialect where they were found roughly translates to [...] "mister saddlebags" [...] (Arabic: أبو جراب) due to the amount of storage space in their <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches.</b> If food is plentiful, the hamster stores it in large amounts.|$|R

500|$|Like other baboons, {{the olive}} baboon has an elongated, dog-like muzzle. In fact, {{along with the}} muzzle, the animal's tail (...) and four-legged gait can make baboons seem very canine. The tail almost {{looks as if it}} is broken, as it is erect for the first quarter, after which it drops down sharply. The bare patch of a baboon's rump, famously seen in {{cartoons}} and movies, is a good deal smaller in the olive baboon. The olive baboon, like most cercopithecines, has a <b>cheek</b> <b>pouch</b> with which to store food.|$|E
500|$|Djungarian hamsters {{are often}} {{found on the}} pet market in Europe, Japan, and North America. Care of the Djungarian hamster is similar to all other species of Phodopus. Djungarian hamsters, along with most rodents, are prone to tumours. They can also receive injury in the <b>cheek</b> <b>pouch</b> by sharp objects {{damaging}} the fragile inner lining. Other health problems include bite wounds, broken teeth, constipation, dehydration, dental malocclusion, diarrhea, and ear problems. The Djungarian hamster is easy to tame. In addition to natural colourings in the wild ("ruddy" [...] or [...] "agouti"), Djungarian hamsters in captivity occur {{in a variety of}} different colors.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> are pockets on {{both sides}} of the head of some mammals between the jaw and the cheek. They can be found on mammals {{including}} the platypus, some rodents, and most monkeys, as well as the marsupial koala. The <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> of chipmunks can reach the size of their body when full.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> {{are located}} in the {{thickness}} of the flange {{on both sides of the}} mouth of some mammals. Monkeys have open <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> within the oral cavity, but they open out in some rodents of America. Hence the name [...] "diplostomes" [...] is associated with them, which means [...] "two mouths." [...] In some rodents, such as hamsters, the <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> are remarkably developed; they form two bags ranging from the mouth to the front of the shoulders. Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire described that some bats of the genus Nycteris have an amazing form of <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches,</b> as they have a narrow opening, through which the bat can introduce air, closing the nasal canal through a special mechanism and pushing air under the skin, so they expire in the tissue, which unites the very loose skin to the underlying muscles.|$|R

5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches,</b> {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> {{have several}} roles; they allow the rapid {{collection}} of food, but {{also serve as}} temporary storage and transport. In monkeys of the subfamily of Cercopithecinae, they allow for more predigested food. <b>Cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> contribute {{to the protection of}} animals by allowing them to carry their food in the pouches to shelter, allowing them to transport their food to safer locations, as they are pressing these pouches {{to the back of the}} mouth with the back of the leg, or moving the jaw. The females of some species of hamster are known to hide their young in their <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> to carry them away when they fear danger. Other species of hamsters are known to fill their pouches with air, allowing them to float better while they swim.The <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> can become infected as a result of an injury caused by a sharp object inserted into them or a fight. An abscess can form, which can be confused with protuberance with stored food. If the abscess bursts and the pus contained therein is absorbed by the animal, it can be a victim of sepsis and die of the poisonous toxins. The <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> can also turn outwards.|$|R

50|$|The <b>cheek</b> <b>pouch</b> is a {{specific}} morphological feature that is evident in particular subgroups of rodents (i.e. Heteromyidae and Geomyidae (or Gopher)), yet a common misconception is that certain families, like Muridae (including the common black and brown rats), contain this structure when, in actuality, their cheeks are merely elastic due to {{a high degree of}} musculature and innervation in the region. The true <b>cheek</b> <b>pouch,</b> however, is evident in the former Heteromyidae and Geomyidae groups.Cheek pouches are more pronounced in certain rodents, such as hamsters, yet this structure is also distinguishable on certain species of rat, like the Gambian pouched rat, of which extensive morphological investigations have been conducted. Aspects including rat pouch musculature, vascularization, and innervation were all explored and compiled through this and other studies. The widely distributed Rattus rattus is an example organism of the Muridae family of rodents that lack a true <b>cheek</b> <b>pouch,</b> rather, they exhibit more elastic cheeks (not true pouches) due to the organization of their cheek musculature.|$|E
50|$|Microcirculation may {{be studied}} in hamster cheek pouches. The pouches of hamsters are thin, easy to examine without {{stopping}} bloodflow, and highly vascular. When examined, the <b>cheek</b> <b>pouch</b> is pulled through the mouth while being grasped with forceps. At {{this point the}} cheek is everted and can be pinned onto a mount for examination.|$|E

50|$|Occasionally, bats stuff their cheek pouches and fly to safe perches to eat {{where they}} move the {{contents}} from one <b>cheek</b> <b>pouch</b> to another, chewing {{with the large}} sharp teeth and swallowing the juices. Once the juice has all been extracted, they spit out the fibrous mass {{in the form of}} a pellet, large masses of which can be seen below trees where bats have been feeding.|$|E
50|$|The rat {{has been}} shown in a study that {{analyzed}} <b>cheek</b> <b>pouch</b> contents of several individuals to eat leaves of grasses and some perennials, stems, and seeds. Seeds of Johnson grass and cultivated oats make up the largest part of their diet. Breeding has not been studied extensively but generally they have a promiscuous mating system, mature early, mate all year with peaks in spring and summer, and have about 3 young per brood.|$|E
50|$|Concerning the musculature, the <b>cheek</b> <b>pouch</b> is {{composed}} primarily of a developed masseter (cheek) muscle that exhibits a high tensile ability. The masseter muscle {{has been shown}} to insert into the pectoralis muscles, allowing for a higher degree of food retention. The pouch is clearly divided between a buccal (cheek) and sublingual (below the tongue) portion. Volumetric analyses within this study attributed the differences in net cheek volume between male and female rats to the average size of the respective sexes.|$|E

500|$|Gophers are {{burrowing}} rodents of {{the family}} Geomyidae, characterized by fur-lined, external <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> used to gather and transport food. The <b>cheek</b> <b>pouches</b> of geomyids such as the camas pocket gopher are controlled {{by a set of}} muscles, with a sphincter controlling the opening and closing of the pouch. A pair of muscles attached to the premaxilla pull the pouches forward, and paired retractor muscles pull the pouches back. These retractor muscles extend back and up from the cheek surfaces, forming a band [...] long and about [...] wide attached to aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi muscle.|$|R
50|$|As for {{innervation}} of this structure, {{the associated}} nerve branches were all found to originate from the facial (CN VII of XII) nerve which initiates at the medulla and passes into the facial canal via the stylomastoid foramen. The primary aforementioned muscle, the masseter, is supplied by two large neural branches {{known as the}} temporalis and zygomatic nerves. The buccal divisions of this nerve supply much of the masseter muscle, which ultimately facilitates the voluntary retention of food within the <b>cheek</b> <b>pouch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Merriam's {{kangaroo}} rats, {{like other}} kangaroo rats and pocket mice, {{are members of}} the family Heteromyidae. Each species within this family has fur-lined food storage pouches. The <b>cheek</b> <b>pouch</b> is utilized as a portable cache for food while foraging. Kangaroo rats are named for their extremely long, kangaroo-like hind feet and they are almost completely bipedal. They hop or jump rather than scurry or run. Because of this, most heteromyid rodents also have a relatively long tail that acts to counterbalance the hopping/jumping form of locomotion.|$|E
