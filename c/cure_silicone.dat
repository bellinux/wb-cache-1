40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a review of}} the attitude of the scientific community towards reliability in electronic packages, with emphasis on the prevailing mechanisms for package failure under highly stressed environmental conditioning. Once this failure mechanism is fully developed, approaches to the resolution can be more rigorously applied. Overall, the predominant evidence points to moisture, both diffusivity and equilibrium weight gain, as the key factor in reduced reliability performance. Other fundamental polymer properties are important, but generally, methods are well established for adjusting these parameters. Moisture uptake is somewhat inherent to a particular chemistry type and this can direct the use of resin systems that are more suited to particularly moist environments. Epoxy resin systems, while pervasive in the electronics industry, do have limitations under humid environmental test conditions. Cyanate ester resin chemistry is claimed to have low moisture uptake by virtue of a non-hydrophilic cure mechanism. However, certain aspects of the cure chemistry and side reactions with water can result in misleading predictions on humid environment performance. Siloxane-based materials present an attractive solution to many moisture related issues. Traditional condensation and addition <b>cure</b> <b>silicone</b> systems have, thus, found widespread use as packaging adhesives and encapsulants. Siloxane-functional polyimides have also been successfully utilized in a number of application areas.

40|$|Dielectric ElectroActive Polymers, or DEAPs, are devices with coupled {{electrical}} and mechanical responses that resemble stretchable parallel plate capacitors, that {{can act as}} actuators, sensors, or electrical generators. Currently, the electrode layers {{on the top and}} bottom are generally conductive carbon grease, which is dirty and also causes curing issues for certain polymers. This thesis explores several polymers and conductive fillers to identify a conductive nanocomposite material, to replace the grease electrode with a solid material and eliminate issues associated with grease electrodes. It then characterizes the mechanical and electric properties and how they change during cyclic loading, while augmenting an equibiaxial tensile testing machine and advancing the knowledge of equibiaxial characterization. The most promising polymer/filler combination was found to be EcoFlex 30, a platinum <b>cure</b> <b>silicone</b> rubber, containing seven volume percent of nickel nanostrands and three volume percent of 0. 1 mm length nickel-coated carbon fiber. Using two conductive fillers of different sizes resulted in much higher conductivity than a single filler alone, and an enormous piezoresistive effect. This material gave weak conductivity at no load, increasing several orders of magnitude as strained and well surpassing the benchmark of 1. 2 S/m set by conductive carbon grease. Elastomer materials were found to have conductivities as high as 275 S/m under peak strain, and changing the nickel-coated carbon fiber length allowed for strains over 120 %. Equibiaxial stress-strain curves were also analyzed for energy lost through hysteresis, in order to compare to published results for DEAPs used as Dielectric Energy Generators. Results and recommendations are presented for using and further improving the materials for applications of DEAPs used as energy harvesters and capacitive sensors, using the material alone as a piezoresistive sensor, and improving the equibiaxial characterization process...|$|E

40|$|Rigid {{silicone}} resins, generally {{referred to}} as polyalkylsilsesquioxanes, are an important class of hybrid thermosetting polymers with both inorganic and organic characteristics. They have superior thermal stability, heat resistance, fire resistance, and still can be easily processed. Silicone resins recently have attracted much interest as low dielectric constant materials replacing silicon dioxide as interlevel dielectrics. Unfortunately, poor mechanical properties, such as brittleness and low strength, limit their broader acceptance and applications. Efforts to toughen them {{date back to the}} 1970 's, but little success has been achieved until now. Conventional polymer toughening techniques, such as incorporating second phase particles directly into the resins, typically do not work. Neither does decreasing the crosslink density of the resin network, which can compromise modulus and other properties. High fracture toughness and modulus addition cure rigid silicone resins are obtained in this study by a combination of intrinsic toughening and extrinsic toughening techniques. The addition <b>cure</b> <b>silicone</b> resin comprises two components: polyphenylsilsesquioxane oligomers containing silicon vinyls and low molecular weight silane crosslinkers containing silicone hydrides. The resin is cured by hydrosilylation between the two. Intrinsic toughening improves the plasticity and rigidity of the resin by choices of crosslinkers and polyphenylsilsesquioxane oligomers. The characteristics of molecular structure of the crosslinker and polyphenylsilsesquioxane oligomers that contribute to high fracture toughness and modulus are identified. (cont.) Extrinsic toughening with rubber particles and rigid inorganic fillers further utilized the improved plastic deformation capability from intrinsic toughening This approach not only increases the fracture toughness from 0. 3 MPam⁰ç⁵ to as high as 1. 44 MPam⁰ç⁵, but also the modulus from 1. 03 GPa to 1. 90 GPa. by Zhongtao Li.

40|$|Electrorheological (ER) {{materials}} have potential applications in electromechanical control as they change their rheological properties upon application of an electrical field. The ER behavior of silicone elastomers filled with {{three types of}} particles including silica, titania and iron was studied. 2 -D numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the influence of structure parameters, material composition and field parameters. Electrical field was applied to align silica and titania particles during the cure of the silicone prepolymer. Dielectric measurements suggested that surface conductivity of silica particles dominated the polarization of the silicone-silica elastomers. The alignment of silica particles increased the dielectric permittivity and the Maxwell-Wagner dispersion. The ER response of the silicone with aligned silica exhibited a deviation from the quadratic dependence on field intensity at high fields accompanied by nonlinear conductivity. The results {{were consistent with the}} computations in that the saturation of the field between particles due to nonlinear conductivity of polymer matrix resulted in a decreased ER response. Silicone-silica elastomers showed an enhancement of ER effect when the particle concentration was increased. For silicone-titania elastomers, the ER response increased with particle permittivity. Silicone-BaTiO 3 elastomer showed a shear-strain dependent ER response as interparticle force decreases with the increase of spacing between adjacent particles. The ER response of the silicone-BaTiO 3 elastomer increased with field frequency as expected from high permittivity of BaTiO 3 relative to silicone. A novel method was developed to prepare ER solids containing iron particles. A magnetic field was employed to align iron particles in a silicone prepolymer. After <b>cure,</b> <b>silicone</b> oil was used to swell the silicone-iron gel. Both microscope observation and conductivity measurements showed that the particles separated after swelling. Silicone-iron gels showed a quadratic dependence of ER response on the field intensity. The ER responses of the silicone-iron gels were two orders of magnitude larger than the prediction of the dipole approximation. When increasing orientation angle of particle chain relative to the field, the ER effect of the silicone-iron gels decreased, which was in a qualitative agreement with the calculation based on the dipole approximation. ...|$|E
40|$|Addition cure (X 1 - 2672) and {{condensation}} cure (4 - 3136) silicone resins {{have been}} studied for their mechanical property change with temperature. Properties include maximum flexural stress, flexural modulus and fracture toughness K[sub]IC. Temperature effect on mechanical properties of addition cure resin is substantial and also depends on the crosslinkers used. Generally the maximum stress and flexural modulus decrease with temperature, and the dependence upon crosslinkers in addition cure resin is obvious. Fracture toughness data of addition <b>cure</b> <b>silicone</b> resins have a peaking behavior with the peak appearing [approximately] 58 - 101 CÌ (depending on the crosslinker) below their glass transition temperatures. This {{can be explained by}} the competing effect between network mobility and rigidity of the silicone polymer. Rate effect on fracture toughness of silylphenylene crosslinked 2672 has also been studied. It is concluded that the temperature effect on such a system is more dominant compared to the rate effect. The condensation resins also experience decrease in modulus and strength but the toughness changes little with temperature. This is due to its tight network structure. Silylphenylene crosslinked addition cure resin (2672 B) and the toughened condensation cure resin (3136 T) were used to make silicone fiberglass laminates. They have been successfully processed with a vacuum bagging technique. Silicone resin composites are proved to be thermally stable, moisture resistant and fire resistant. However, they have weak strength and modulus. Their temperature dependence of mechanical properties is also big and results in poor property retention at high temperatures. 2672 B was used to produce hybrid composites with an organic resin-vinyl ester. The processes of curing the hybrid composites in both sequential cure and co-cure methods prove to be successful. The hybrid composites are stronger and their property retention at elevated temperatures is improved compared to silicone resin composites. They also have improved moisture resistance, thermal stability and fire resistance over vinyl ester composites. The co-cured V/B 8 / 4 structure has excellent strength and rigidity and also extraordinary property retention at high temperatures, which {{can be explained by the}} chemical reaction at the silicone resin and vinyl ester resin interface. The hybrid composites prove to be successful in having balanced mechanical and environmental properties. by Yuhong Wu. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Objects can be classed as a ‘prompt’ to “our {{conscious}} {{lives of}} inexplicable mysteries which exist [...] . as reminders {{of people who}} are absent” (Ash, 1996, p. 220). Objects embody memories for individuals reminding them of special times, people and places. To others this object may have no worth, but in conjunction with a memory adds attachment and value. As a maker my previous work includes a collection of fashion artefacts entitled “Absence” in which each object played with the idea of absence and presence and questions functionality. The process of casting objects in platinum <b>cure</b> <b>silicone</b> then using the mould, as the basis of the finished piece is a technique I have developed, leaving a negative space, but a positive ghost like representation of what once was present, creating a lasting material memory. I am currently creating a series of ten artefacts that capture individual’s lost relationships by fusing memories and existing objects that have become imprinted and embellished with the characteristics of the original owner. The finished artefacts will represent individuals lost love in a material form. My practice develops the use of both traditional leatherwork and silicone moulding techniques in conjunction with modern processes from laser cutting to 3 D printing. The N-Exlace was produced as my own personal response to the emotional transfer of memory to artefact and became the first in the series for ‘Making Memories’. Before working with other people’s stories I wanted to use my own experience of a lost romantic relationship to develop process and techniques. Love letters and photographs were rediscovered. Old diary entries were used to provide a contrast between what I’ve deemed the ‘public’ and ‘hidden’ side of the relationship. A locket kept as a memento was used in silicone casting experiments, which produced a ghostly imprinted sphere, signifying the memory of the object. The making process used traditional handcrafts that were labour intensive and physical allowing each stage and memory of the relationship to be considered and processed in turn whilst making. Techniques such as experimental acetone printing left letters and photographs distressed and faded, adding to the feeling of memories being forgotten. Working from instinct the piece took the form of a necklace. Very literal to the cast locket embedded within it but the leather began to symbolise my own skin that had been imprinted with memories, but now had been ‘processed’ so was detached from my own body. Concluding this phase of making allowed me to become fully absorbed in the emotions and feelings of the relationship again, establishing the idea that emotion is transferred from making to artefact. Working with 10 items my process of making comes from my background as a fashion practitioner, where having collected and analysed the 10 selected stories from original interviews, I have developed a series that can be worked on holistically. The story is a constant guide to the making processes leading to developing new techniques and skills within my own practice and inventive outcomes within the series of finished artefacts...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} piece that has been created {{as part of a}} wider on going {{practice}} based research project entitled “Can an artefact be created to store the memory of lost love”. The study hypothetically defines what love is in the context of differing relationships, such as familial, platonic and romantic the explanation of ‘lost love’ is to be explored as this changes the status and emotion felt. Lost love {{for the purpose of this}} study is defined as love felt for a person who is estranged from another, no longer in contact with or passed away from the participant. The reasoning behind using lost love as the starting point is considered here. “Lost or dead loves, enshrined in an aura of imaginary perfection, seem to hover over all our loves…within the imagination, they take on a magical and healing power. We idealise their attributes, make them the bearers of all our good and wholeness, the healers of our wounds” (Appignanesi, 2011, p. 36). The study will capture a number of participants lost love narratives, which will then be translated in to the design of storage artefacts. These narratives of lost love portray heightened emotion; therefore creating the belief that this lost love can be transubstantiated and harnessed within an object. The chest is an area of the body synonymous with love. Our heart, being the symbol of love is encased here, our neck being a sensual area on display or waiting to be kissed. The N-exlace is an accessory or the means to ‘store’ the love of a lost relationship. The natural veg tanned leather is moulded tightly to the curves and undulations of the body to allow a seamless fit as if the leather was the skin from earlier years. Imprinted on the leather are memories of the relationship, both good and bad. Images from happier times in photo booths, playfully pulling faces, letters and postcards received talking about the future and that pain of being apart and diary excerpts as the relationship broke down, knowing it was nearly over, but not sure where to turn or what to do. In the centre of piece is a bubble. The ghost of an object symbolizing the embodiment of the lost love. A locket once given as a gift. Like the love, the locket no longer remains, but the imprint on the person is still present, leaving memories that shape our character, lifestyle and fashion choices and in certain aspects our future relationships. The Design Process This is a personal piece, rather than creating from collected narratives. Therefore the locket, letters, photographs and diary entries are all my own. The design process started with collecting these souvenirs from a previous relationship or ‘lost love’ and experimenting with how the objects could be applied to create a new fashion artefact. Casting with translucent silicone is a predominant part of my work as it allows the detail of objects to be captured clearly and viewed as if they were still present. I like to re-imagine objects as being absent from their original location, but leaving a lasting impression in the space they once possessed. The locket here felt as if it should still be part of the skin and so I chose to embed it into the leather. Like tattoos, the memories from the relationship are captured on the leather/skin and remind the wearer about the relationship, both happy and sad times. The design and making process allowed me to rethink the ending of the relationship and acted as a therapeutic cathartic exercise remembering why choices were made, but how they have shaped who I have become. Making Process The leather was decorated with old photographs and excerpts by using acetone printing, where by a reverse image is placed face down on the leather, then acetone is painted on and rubbed through to create the print. This gives a distressed finish depending on how hard or regular the paper is rubbed. Traditional leather craft technique of wet moulding natural vegetable tanned leather to form the shape of the piece. It is then left to dry and set into place. The leather is finished using traditional edge burnishing techniques and carnauba crème wax finishing. The locket was cast using a platinum <b>cure</b> <b>silicone</b> and a spherical mould. The locket was suspended just on the surface of the silicone to give the front half impression. The bezel of the locket remains as an idea of what once was there.

Dimensions of the disinfected impressions and their resultant casts were measured using a computerized digital caliper, and the dimen-sional changes were calculated. Reproduction of detail and surface quality of the resultant casts were assessed by grading casts sur-faces according to a specific scoring system. Results: The 0. 5 % sodium hypochlorite was found to produce the least dimensional changes in all the impression materials. Corsodyl produced the maximum changes in both alginate and zinc-oxide eu-genol while addition-cured silicon was most affected by Gluteralde-hyde and condensation-cured silicon was most affected by Hexana.

For each paint an impression was recorded of a gauge block of known step height (1270 μm) and five impressions of the palatal surface of a laboratory standard maxillary central incisor were also recorded. All impressions were taken using an addition <b>cured</b> <b>silicone</b> impression material (President). The resultant electroconductive replicas were mapped using a computer controlled probe. This data was analysed to determine both the replica's step height and, using surface matching techniques, the reproducibility of the replication process. The mean step heights recorded were; EC= 1268 · 43 (s. d. = 12 · 09), SP= 1267 · 09 (s. d. 1 · 77) and EB 1299 · 58 (s. d. 14 · 47). Both EC and SP recorded the step height to within 3 μm. In the repeat replication of the palatal surface of an upper central incisor SP maintained a greater constancy of surface topography (99 · 6 %) that was statistically superior to both EC (P < 0 · 05) and EB (P < 0 · 01).

40|$|A microrheological {{method is}} {{employed}} {{for the first}} time to continuously and undisturbedly monitor variations of viscoelasticity of magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) based on silica-coated carbonyl iron particles (SiCIPs) -filled <b>silicone</b> during the <b>curing</b> process. Results indicate that the elasticity of MREs dramatically increases with increasing magnetic field intensity, which is much more significant in comparison with the slow process of <b>silicone</b> <b>curing</b> at 25 % and 40 % SiCIPs. The formations of chain-like structure of SiCIPs and <b>cured</b> network of <b>silicone</b> are recognized, both contributing to the rheology of MREs, suggesting the possibility of developing a facile method for adjusting the rheology and fixing the structure of a wide range of MREs by applying magnetic field during the curing of matrix...|$|R
40|$|A {{real-time}} three-dimensional (3 D) object sensing {{and reconstruction}} scheme is presented {{that can be}} applied on any arbitrary corporeal shape. Operation is demonstrated on several calibrated objects. The system uses curvature sensors based upon in-line fiber Bragg gratings encapsulated in a low-temperature <b>curing</b> synthetic <b>silicone.</b> New methods to quantitatively evaluate the performance of a 3 D object-sensing scheme are developed and appraised. It is shown that the sensing scheme yields a volumetric error of 1 % to 9 %, depending on the object. © 2012 Optica...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{mechanically}} stimulated saliva, {{the participants were asked}} to chew onto a piece of tubing (200 mm cut pieces of 1.6 mm bore, 1.4 mm wall platinum <b>cured</b> <b>silicone</b> tubing) for 1 minute and then expectorate the first component while keeping the tubing in the mouth. The participants expectorated the saliva into a pre-labelled sterile container once every 30 seconds while chewing onto the tubing until an adequate volume (~ 2 mL of saliva) was collected. The samples were then immediately placed on ice to minimise bacterial degradation of salivary proteins until further processing. In order to collect acid stimulated saliva, food-grade citric acid (0.25 %, supermarket grade) was prepared and participants were asked to swirl 5 mL of the citric acid solution in the mouth for 15 seconds and then expectorate into a waste container. This procedure was repeated. The participants were then asked to pool saliva in their mouth and expectorate every 30 seconds into a pre-labelled sterile container until ~ 2 mL of saliva was collected and processed on ice similar to the above procedure. Salivary flow rate was calculated by dividing the saliva volume (mL, measured using a pipette) by the time (mins) it took to produce the volume of saliva measured.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} in-line {{curvature}} sensors on a garment {{are used to}} monitor the thoracic and abdominal movements of a human during respiration. These results are used to obtain volumetric tidal changes of the human torso in agreement with a spirometer used simultaneously at the mouth. The curvature sensors are based on long-period gratings (LPGs) written in a progressive three-layered fiber to render the LPGs insensitive to the refractive index external to the fiber. A curvature sensor consists of the fiber long-period grating laid on a carbon fiber ribbon, which is then encapsulated in a low-temperature <b>curing</b> <b>silicone</b> rubber. The sensors have a spectral sensitivity to curvature, d lambda/dR from similar to 7 -nm m to similar to 9 -nm m. The interrogation technique is borrowed from derivative spectroscopy and monitors {{the changes in the}} transmission spectral profile of the LPG's attenuation band due to curvature. The multiplexing of the sensors is achieved by spectrally matching a series of distributed feedback (DFB) lasers to the LPGs. The versatility of this sensing garment is confirmed by it being used on six other human subjects covering a wide range of body mass indices. Just six fully functional sensors are required to obtain a volumetric error of around 6 %. (C) 2007 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers...|$|R
