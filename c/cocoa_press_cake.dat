Objectives of {{this research}} were to investigate functional properties, such as solubility, emulsifying, foaming, film forming, and adhesive properties, of Jatropha <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> proteins and compared those with relevant industrial proteins. From our study, we found that protein extracted from <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> proteins had a solubility of about 90 % above pH 9. Emulsifying properties of <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> protein were comparable to sodium caseinates and reached the highest value at pH 9 – 10. Jatropha proteins formed films with tensile strength of 0. 4 – 1. 8 MPa with 10 – 75 % elongation, which were below soy protein or wheat-gluten. Further oil removal from <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> decreased emulsifying properties, while increased foaming and adhesive properties of the extracted proteins. Protein extracted from de-oiled <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> showed better foaming properties than sodium caseinate at pH 10, but lower than egg white protein at all pH. Furthermore, <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> protein showed better adhesive properties than casein adhesives at the same dry matter content. Based on these results, Jatropha <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> protein showed most promising results on adhesive and emulsifying properties, which indicate the potential of Jatropha <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> protein as emulsifier or paper adhesive...|$|R

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of jatropha <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> on soil fertility attributes and on lettuce production and accumulation of nutrients in the shoots. The experiment was conducted in pots in a greenhouse, in a randomized block design with eight treatments and five replicates. The treatments consisted of doses of jatropha <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> equivalent to 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0, 8. 0, 16. 0 and 32. 0 t ha- 1.

The {{aim of the}} work {{was to investigate the}} effect of PEF pre-treatment of raspberry, bilberry and black currant berries on the recovery of phenolic compounds from the <b>press</b> <b>cakes</b> left after the juice pressing. Fresh berries were mechanically pressed using a lab-designed pressing chamber. PEF pre-treatments of varying electric field strength and specific energy input were applied to berries prior to juice pressing. The <b>press</b> <b>cakes</b> left after the juice production were subjected to further extraction with acidified aqueous ethanol. The total phenolics (TP), anthocyanins (TA) contents, and antioxidant activity of the extracts were analyzed. Significantly higher amounts of TP and TA were extracted from the <b>press</b> <b>cakes</b> of PEF-treated berries. For raspberry <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> extracts an increase in TP content was in the range of 6 - 22 % (3 kV/cm 12 kJ/kg and 3 kV/cm 1 kJ/kg treatment, respectively), for black currant <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> extracts – in the range of 55 - 69 % (1 kV/cm 10 kJ/kg and 0. 5 kV/cm 10 kJ/kg treatment, respectively) and for bilberry <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> extracts - 36 - 89 % (1 kV/cm 10 kJ/kg and 5 kV/cm 10 kJ/kg treatment, respectively). The extracts from <b>press</b> <b>cakes</b> obtained after PEF assisted juice pressing had stronger ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). In comparison to the untreated samples, PEF pre-treatment of raspberries, black currants and bilberries increased FRAP of their <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> extracts by up to 24 %, 61 % and 80 %, respectively. The data obtained in this study demonstrate that PEF pre-treatment of berries resulted in better extractability of phenolic antioxidants from the <b>press</b> <b>cakes</b> left after the juice production.

Currently, the level of dietary fibre (DF) intake is not adequate. Berries are an elementary part of the recommended Nordic healthy diet and could be consumed in higher amounts. Materials and methods: Finnish bilberries and a bilberry <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> from juice processing were studied for DF content, carbohydrate composition, and non-carbohydrate fibre content, which was analysed as sulphuric acid insoluble and soluble material. The microstructure of all samples was also studied using light microscopy and toluidine blue O, calcofluor, and acid fuchsin staining. Results: The total DF contents of fresh and freeze-dried bilberries and the <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> were 3. 0, 24. 1, and 58. 9 %, respectively. Most of the DF was insoluble. Only about half of it was carbohydrate, the rest being mostly sulphuric acidinsoluble material, waxy cutin from skins, and resilient seeds. Bilberry seeds represented over half of the <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> fraction, and in addition to skin, they were the major DF sources. Microscopy revealed that skins in the <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> were intact and the surface of the seeds had thick-walled cells.

The influence of seed pre-treatment, i. e. whole, crushed and deshelled seeds, screw-press operational settings (shaft rotational speed and <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> outlet section) was investigated. For each experiment, the material flows (seeds, <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> and crude oil) were measured and analysed for their oil, water and solids contents. The behaviour of oil expression was {{very sensitive to}} seeds preparation. It was shown that for whole seeds, a good reproducibility was obtained, whereas for crushed or deshelled seeds, heterogeneity of the feed led to unsteady pressing conditions and important discrepancies in the performance. The presence of seed shells contributes to build a porous solid matrix which favours oil flow through the <b>press</b> <b>cake.</b> For whole seeds, a correlation between oil recovery and seed throughput was proposed. The mass balance consistency was carefully analysed and oil yield was determined using a direct and an indirect method. A good linear correlation between seed and <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> throughputs was observed: the seed throughput is always divided in a stream of crude oil and a stream of <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> in the same proportion. This important result shows that the residual oil in <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> {{and the amount of}} solids carried by the oil are directly related and determine the efficacy of the separation. Thus, for a given screw press and feed material, the oil sediment content can be predicted knowing the oil recovery. The energy consumption during pressing was measured and modelled as a function of oil recovery and seeds oil content. The specific mechanical energy for oil expression was less than 5 % of the energy content of the oil and a minimum mechanical energy requirement was generally observed at oil recoveries between 70 % and 80 %.

The stock solution of copper with different concentration were added to synthetic water and different dosages of <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> was added and the copper concentration before and after addition of the biosorbent was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The residual turbidity was measured as using jar test and reported. The results showed that the Moringa oleifera <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> is reducing the copper concentration up to 53. 49 %, and turbidity removal up to 75. 45 %. More research need to be carried out to find the optimum conditions to remove Cu (II) from water...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} {{consisted}} of manufacturing renewable binderless fiberboards from coriander straw and a deoiled coriander <b>press</b> <b>cake,</b> thus at the same time ensuring the valorization of crop residues and process by-products. The <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> acted as a natural binder inside the boards owing to the thermoplastic behavior of its protein fraction during thermopressing. The influence of different fiber-refining methods was evaluated and it was shown that a twin-screw extrusion treatment effectively improved fiber morphology and resulted in fiberboards with enhanced performance as compared to a conventional grinding process. The best fiberboard was produced with extrusion-refined straw using a 0. 4 liquid/solid (L/S) ratio and with 40 % <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> addition. The water sensitivity of the boards was effectively reduced by 63 % through the addition of an extrusion raw material premixing operation and thermal treatment of the panels at 200 °C, resulting in materials with good performance showing a flexural strength of 29 MPa and a thickness swelling of 24 %. Produced without the use of any chemical adhesives, these fiberboards could thus present viable, sustainable alternatives for current commercial wood-based materials such as oriented strand board, particleboard and medium-density fiberboard, with high cost-effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|The world coffee {{consumption}} {{has been}} growing for its appreciated taste and its beneficial effects on health. The residual biomass of coffee, originated in the food industry after oil extraction from coffee beans, called coffee beans residual <b>press</b> <b>cake,</b> has attracted interest {{as a source of}} compounds with antioxidant activity. This study investigated the chemical composition of aqueous extracts of coffee beans residual <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> (AE), their antioxidant activity, and the effect of topical application on the skin wound healing, in animal model, of hydrogels containing the AE, chlorogenic acid (CGA), allantoin (positive control), and carbopol (negative control). The treatments’ performance was compared by measuring the reduction of the wound area, with superior result (p< 0. 05) for the green coffee AE (78. 20 %) with respect to roasted coffee AE (53. 71 %), allantoin (70. 83 %), and carbopol (23. 56 %). CGA hydrogels reduced significantly the wound area size on the inflammatory phase, which may be associated with the well known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of that compound. The topic use of the coffee AE studied improved the skin wound healing and points to an interesting biotechnological application of the coffee bean residual <b>press</b> <b>cake...</b>|$|R
