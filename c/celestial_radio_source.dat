40|$|Connected element {{interferometry}} (CEI) is {{a technique}} of observing a <b>celestial</b> <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> at two spatially separated antennas and then interfering the received signals to extract the relative phase of the signal at the two antennas. The high precision of the resulting phase delay data type can provide an accurate determination of the angular position of the radio source relative to the baseline vector between the two stations. This article describes a recently developed connected element interferometer on a 21 -km baseline between two antennas at the Deep Space Network's Goldstone, California, tracking complex. Fiber-optic links are used to transmit the data to a common site for processing. The system incorporates a real-time correlator to process these data in real time. The architecture {{of the system is}} described, and observational data are presented to characterize the potential performance of such a system. The real-time processing capability offers potential advantages in terms of increased reliability and improved delivery of navigational data for time-critical operations.

The detection displayed the antenna pattern signature of a transiting <b>celestial</b> <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> but was not repeated in subsequent transit observations. The event has been advanced {{by some as a}} candidate interstellar signal and dismissed by others as probable interference; no independent attempt to replicate the event with a spectral resolution comparable to Ohio StateÏs has been reported. We used the Very Large Array to search for a possible underlying sourceÈartiÐcial or naturalÈwhich could account for the detection by occasionally brightening because of scintillation, intrinsic variability, or some other mechanism. With a sensitivity greater than 100 times the original observations, we found two continuum sources within the Ohio State coordinate error boxes, but they displayed no unusual spectral features, showed no sign of Ñux variability, yielded normal spectral indices based on additional observations at 6 cm, and were too weak to account for the Ohio State detection. No narrow-bandwidth point sources were detected over a band of 1. 5 MHz to a Ñux limit of about 20 mJy at the nominal coordinates. We conclude that the “ “ Wow ÏÏ was not due to a continuous source usually below Ohio StateÏs several jansky detection threshold but occasionally increasing in Ñux by a factor of less than D 100.

40|$|Compensation of {{interferometer}} phase fluctuations due {{mainly to}} the atmospheruc water vapor {{is one of the}} most important subjects for future millimeter- and submillimeter-wave radio synthesis arrays and future millimeter-wave very long baseline arrays because the fluctuations are the most serious limiting factor for their spatial resolutions and sensitivities. In the present thesis, a method for the atmospheric phase cornpensatxon called 2 ̆ 7 Paired Antennas Method (PAM) 2 ̆ 7 is examined in detail. The PAM uses pairs of closely located antennas in order to simultaneously observe a target radio source and an adjacent reference calibrator with nearly parallel baselines and correct the interferometer phase of the target source using that of the reference source. The effectiveness of the PAM was studied by means of interferometer phase compensation experiments using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array and the Nobeyarna Radio Seeing Monitor at Nobeyuma Radio Observatory of National Astrononucal Observatory, Japan. In the experiments, a <b>celestial</b> <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> 3 C 279 and a geostationary satellite (Japanese Communication Satellite called 2 ̆ 7 CS 2 ̆ 7) were simultaneously observed and the angular-separation dependence of the effectiveness of the phase compensation was investigated. It was always clearly seen in the experiments that the phase compensation with the PAM was very successful when the separation angle was smaller than a few degrees, even in the case that the millimeter-wave interferometer phase of the target source was compensated using the centimeter-wave phase of the reference source. The degree of phase compensation aheady achieved the level of less than 0. 1 mm rms in excess path length, which is the goal of the planned new arrays for the future submillimeter-wave radio interferometry, when the atmospheric condition at Nobeyama was good enough. This demonstrates that the high resolution and high quality radio images are readily obtainable in the future large submillimeter-wave arrays at least if one uses the PAM or similar method of equivalent performance in order to eliminate the atmospheric phase fluctuations. A model of the atmospheric structure was constructed to account for the experimental results on the basis of the Kolmogorov turbulence, frozen flow, and phase screen. A statistical calculation of the residual rms phase of the corrected phase in the PAM, based on the above atmospheric structure model, led to the numerical results in excellent agreement with a number of features of the experimental results. This implies that the underlying model, though simple, is a fairly good approximation of the reality. The computer simulations for the phase compensation in terms of the PAM at the potential sites of the future submillimeter-wave arrays revealed impressive results promising that the necessary level of the phase compensation for the future arrays is achieved, provided that suitable reference sources are available within a few degrees around a target source. The antenna-switching method is also a promising phase compensation technique similar to the PAM. Although the switching observation itself was not carried out in the phase compensation experiments with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array and Nobeyama Radio Seeing Monitor, I studied this method using the demonstrated data series produced from the PAM-experimental data and investigated the separation-angle dependence. Using the statistical model developed in the present thesis, the feasibility of the antenna-switching method was compared with that of the PAM and investigated in terms of the specific parameters such as the switching cycle time or the ON source time to a target source within one switching cycle. The computer simulations based on the model showed the potential of the antenna-switching method, which is equally effective in the phase compensation ability as the PAM if radio telescope antennas are able to slew fast enough. It was thus confirmed that the fast antenna-switching method is an effective way to realize the precise phase compensation with the simpler system than the PAM 2 ̆ 7 s. It is also noted that the PAM has an important merit in the long time integration to obtain the higher signal-to-noise ratio while observing weak radio sources...|$|E

40|$|When a wave propagates {{through a}} {{turbulent}} medium, scattering by the random refractive index inhomogeneities {{can lead to}} a wide variety of phenomena that have been the subject of extensive study. The observed scattering effects include amplitude or intensity scintillation, phase scintillation, angular broadening, and spectral broadening, among others. In this paper, I will refer to these scattering effects collectively as scintillation. Although the most familiar example is probably the twinkling of stars (light wave intensity scintillation by turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere), scintillation has been encountered and investigated in such diverse fields as ionospheric physics, oceanography, radio astronomy, and radio and optical communications. Ever since planetary spacecraft began exploring the solar system, scintillation has appeared during the propagation of spacecraft radio signals through planetary atmospheres, planetary ionospheres, and the solar wind. Early studies of these phenomena were motivated by the potential adverse effects on communications and navigation, and on experiments that use the radio link to conduct scientific investigations. Examples of the latter are radio occultation measurements (described below) of planetary atmospheres to deduce temperature profiles, and the search for gravitational waves. However,these concerns soon gave way to the emergence of spacecraft radio scintillation as a new scientific tool for exploring small-scale dynamics in planetary atmospheres and structure in the solar wind, complementing in situ and other remote sensing spacecraft measurements, as well as scintillation measurements using natural (<b>celestial)</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources.</b> The purpose of this paper is to briefly describe and review the solar system spacecraft radio scintillation observations, to summarize the salient features of wave propagation analyses employed in interpreting them, to underscore the unique remote sensing capabilities and scientific relevance of the scintillation measurements, and to highlight some of the scientific results obtained to date.

Such measurements could serve as the initial step in calibrating the ionospheric phases that distort astronomical images, thereby allowing the LWA to reach its full astrophysical potential. At the same time, it could generate a dynamic, all-sky model model of the ionosphere rich in phenomenology. This method consists of rapidly cycling through and imaging the several hundred <b>celestial</b> <b>radio</b> emitters (<b>sources)</b> that we predict will be isolated enough to be imaged with standard calibration techniques.

40|$|Modern cold-atom-based {{frequency}} standards have already archived {{the uncertainty of}} 10 − 15 at a few days. Moreover coldatom- based optical clocks {{have the potential to}} realize the uncertainty of from 10 − 16 to 10 − 17 level after a few hours. On the other hand, time transfer precision of two-way satellite time and frequency transfer and GPS carrier phase experiments have reached the 10 − 10 @ 1 sec (10 − 15 @ 1 day) level. In order to compare such modern standards by these time transfer techniques, it is necessary to average over long periods. Since these techniques are not sufficient to compare next standards improvements of high precision time transfer techniques are strongly desired. Space geodetic techniques like VLBI, SLR and GPS are based on precise time measurement using very stable reference signals. VLBI measures the arrival time delays between multiple stations utilizing radio signals from distant <b>celestial</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> like quasars and pulsars. In the usual geodetic VLBI analysis, clock offsets and their rates of change at each station are estimated with respect to a selected reference station. The averaged formal error (1 sigma) of the clock offsets is typically about 20 picoseconds when analyzing geodetic VLBI experiments which are regularly conducted by the International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS). This precision is nearly one order better than other techniques like GPS or two-way satellite time transfer. In this study we compare time transfer precision between VLBI and GPS carrier phase using the Kashima-Koganei baseline in order to confirm the potential of VLBI time and frequency transfer. VLBI experiments were performed four times (two 24 hour sessions, one 3 days session and one 7 days session) and GPS observations were carried out at the same time sharing common reference signals. The averaged formal error (1 sigma) of the hourly estimated clock offsets as obtained from VLBI analysis was 30 picoseconds. The difference between VLBI and GPS was about +/- 500 picoseconds what is considered to be caused by the uncertainty of the GPS time transfer. The results show that VLBI time transfer is more stable than GPS time transfer on the same baseline. We also compare time transfer precision using the Onsala-Wettsell baseline. We used R 1 experiments (R 1270, R 1271, R 1273 and R 1274 sessions) conducted by IVS and the International GNSS Service (IGS) stations (ONSA and WTZR) data. The results show more clearly that VLBI time transfer is more stable than GPS time transfer on the same baseline and same period. In general, the VLBI time transfer stability follows 1 /tau very close.

With the introduction of satellite technology, it became possible to create a more accurate and detailed global map. With these advances there also arose the necessity to define a reference meridian that, whilst being derived from the Airy Transit Circle, would also take into account the effects of plate movement and variations {{in the way that the}} Earth was spinning.As a result, the International Reference Meridian was established and is commonly used to denote Earth's prime meridian (0° longitude) by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, which defines and maintains the link between longitude and time.

Many years the identification process is carried out with the coordinate coincidence criteria, which leads to abundant misidentifications and "empty field" in optics for the <b>radio</b> <b>sources.</b> For this reason significant part of <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> do not have identifications in optic. In present paper we consider the radio refraction in the Galaxy, which significantly changes the coordinates of <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> if compared with the optical one. By {{taking into account the}} radio refraction, the major number of the <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> can be successfully identified with the optical objects.
