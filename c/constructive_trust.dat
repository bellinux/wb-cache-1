5|$|Where {{payments}} {{have been}} made by mistake claimants {{may or may not be}} able to recoup their losses. The leading case is Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC, where Lord Browne-Wilkinson declared that a <b>constructive</b> <b>trust</b> would be created when the recipient of the funds became aware of the mistaken transfer. As such, ignorance of the mistake would not create a fiduciary relationship, therefore not a trust, and the property would be untraceable.|$|E
25|$|Bribes were {{initially}} considered {{not to be}} held on <b>constructive</b> <b>trust,</b> but {{were considered to be}} held as a debt by the fiduciary to the principal. This approach has been overruled; the bribe is now classified as a <b>constructive</b> <b>trust.</b> The change is due to pragmatic reasons, especially in regard to a bankrupt fiduciary. If a fiduciary takes a bribe and that bribe is considered a debt then if the fiduciary goes bankrupt the debt will be left in his pool of assets to be paid to creditors and the principal may miss out on recovery because other creditors were more secured. If the bribe is treated as held on a <b>constructive</b> <b>trust</b> then it will remain in the possession of the fiduciary, despite bankruptcy, until such time as the principal recovers it.|$|E
25|$|Unjust {{enrichment}} is seen {{to underlie}} a final group of <b>constructive</b> <b>trust</b> cases, although this remains controversial. In Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd Goulding J held that a bank that mistakenly paid money to another bank had a claim to the money back under a <b>constructive</b> <b>trust.</b> Mistake would typically {{be seen as an}} unjust enrichment claim today, and there is no debate over whether the money could be claimed back in principle. It was, however, questioned whether the claim for the money back should be proprietary in nature, and so whether a <b>constructive</b> <b>trust</b> should arise, particularly if this would bind third parties (for instance, if the recipient bank had gone insolvent). In Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that a <b>constructive</b> <b>trust</b> could only arise if the recipient's conscience would have been affected {{at the time of the}} receipt or before any third party's rights had intervened. In this way, it is controversial whether unjust enrichment underlies any constructive trusts at all, although it remains unclear why someone's conscience being affected should make any difference.|$|E

Becker. While English law {{is based on the}} concept of institutional <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts</b> (as it was later described by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council), Canadian courts have broadened it to include remedial <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts.</b> Australian and New Zealand jurisprudence can be characterized as falling in between the other two.|$|R

25|$|Secret commissions, or bribes, {{also come}} under the no profit rule. The bribe shall be held in <b>constructive</b> <b>trust</b> for the principal. The person who made the bribe cannot recover it, since he has {{committed}} a crime. Similarly, the fiduciary, who received the bribe, has committed a crime. Fiduciary duties are an aspect of equity and, {{in accordance with the}} equitable principles, or maxims, equity serves those with clean hands. Therefore, the bribe is held on <b>constructive</b> <b>trust</b> for the principal, the only innocent party.|$|E

25|$|Constructive trusts {{pop up in}} {{many aspects}} of equity, not just in a {{remedial}} sense, but, in this sense, {{what is meant by}} a <b>constructive</b> <b>trust</b> is that the court has created and imposed a duty on the fiduciary to hold the money in safekeeping until it can be rightfully transferred to the principal.|$|E

25|$|An {{account of}} profits is another {{potential}} remedy. It is usually used where the {{breach of duty}} was ongoing or when the gain is hard to identify.

The ruling also ordered a <b>constructive</b> <b>trust</b> of $625,486.90. Judge Kimball dismissed the case with no possibility to re-file the suit with an amended complaint, restricting SCO to pursue the case only in appeals.|$|E
25|$|Re Hobley adopts the {{unconscionability}} rationale {{such that}} {{the imposition of a}} <b>constructive</b> <b>trust</b> is only justified by unconscionability, therefore there must be detrimental reliance. This would appear to be analogous to the doctrine of estoppel. Another consequence of this approach is that the trust must come into existence before the death of the first testator as otherwise {{the subject matter of the}} trust would be uncertain and could possible be avoided by inter vivos dispositions.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{aspect of}} the debate among those who favour {{substantive}} fusion is (beyond whether rights in trusts are personal or proprietary) which underlying [...] "event" [...] to which different trusts [...] "respond". Adding to the scheme of Gaius, that saw obligations as coming from contracts and wrongs, unjust enrichment lawyers emphasised that their field was a neglected tertium quid. According to the most influential scheme advocated by Peter Birks, obligations divide into consents, wrongs, unjust enrichments, and [...] "miscellaneous" [...] other events. On this view, express trusts (like contracts, gifts, or estoppels) were consent based, some <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts</b> were too, while other <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts</b> produced rights (proprietary, or with priority in insolvency) for wrongs, and other <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts</b> and all resulting trusts were founded in unjust enrichment.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{resulting}} trusts {{are generally}} thought {{to respond to}} an absence of an intention to benefit another person when property is transferred, and the growing view is that underlying this is a desire to prevent unjust enrichment, there is less agreement about [...] "constructive trusts". At least since 1677, <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts</b> have been recognised in English courts in about seven to twelve circumstances (depending on how the counting and categorisation is done). Because <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts</b> were developed by the Court of Chancery, it was historically said that a trust was [...] "construed" [...] or imposed by the court on someone who acquired property, whenever good conscience required it. In the US case, Beatty v Guggenheim Exploration Co, Cardozo J remarked that the [...] "constructive trust is the formula through which the conscience of equity finds expression. When property has been acquired in such circumstances that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the beneficial interest, equity converts him into a trustee." [...] However, this did not say what underlay the seemingly different situations where <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts</b> were found. In Canada, the Supreme Court at one point held that all <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts</b> responded to someone being [...] "unjustly enriched" [...] by coming to hold another person's property, but it later changed its mind, given that property could come to be held when it was unfair to keep through other means, particularly a wrong or through an incomplete consensual obligation. It is generally accepted that <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts</b> have been created for reasons, and so the more recent debate has therefore turned on which <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts</b> {{should be considered as}} arising to perfect a consent based obligation (like a contract), which ones arise in response to wrongdoing (like a tort) and which ones (if any) arise in response to unjust enrichment, or some other reasons. Consents, wrongs, unjust enrichments, and miscellaneous other reasons are usually seen as being at least three of the main categories of [...] "event" [...] that give rise to obligations in English law, and <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts</b> may straddle all of them.|$|R

25|$|Trusts may {{be created}} by the {{expressed}} intentions of the settlor (express trusts) or they may {{be created by}} operation of law known as implied trusts. An implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties. Implied trusts are divided into two categories: resulting and constructive. A resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties, but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent. A <b>constructive</b> <b>trust</b> is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties, regardless of their intentions.|$|E

Ellis was reinstated to the board in January 2006 after winning civil proceedings against the board members who removed him. On June 6, 2007, lawyers acting for Albert Ellis filed a suit against the Albert Ellis Institute in New York state court.

25|$|This {{situation}} {{represents a}} conflict of interest and duty. Both X and Y hold fiduciary duties to each other, which means they must subdue their own interests in favor of the duo's collective interest. By signing an individual contract and taking all the money, X has put personal interest above the fiduciary duty. Therefore, a court will find that X has breached his fiduciary duty. The judicial remedy here will be that X holds both the contract and the money in a <b>constructive</b> <b>trust</b> for the duo. Note, X will not be punished or totally denied of the benefit; both X and Y will receive a half share in the contract and the money.|$|E

25|$|A {{fiduciary}} {{must not}} {{profit from the}} fiduciary position. This includes any benefits or profits which, although unrelated to the fiduciary position, came about because of an opportunity that the fiduciary position afforded. It is unnecessary that the principal would {{have been unable to}} make the profit; if the fiduciary makes a profit, by virtue of his role as fiduciary for the principal, then the fiduciary must report the profit to the principal. If the principal provides fully informed consent, then the fiduciary may keep the benefit and be absolved of any liability for what would be a breach of fiduciary duty. If this requirement is not met then the property is deemed by the court to be held by the fiduciary on <b>constructive</b> <b>trust</b> for the principal.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{requirement}} that the profit be directly made from the fiduciary position, merely {{in a way that}} causes a conflict between the fiduciary's personal interests and his duties. If a trustee was informed by the trust's stockbroker that only one parcel of highly sought-after stocks remained and chose to purchase it for himself rather than for the trust, he would be taking advantage of the trust and causing a conflict of interest. On the second issue, Boardman confirmed a defence of authorisation; if the fiduciary has informed the beneficiaries that he is and will be acting on his own behalf, and received permission to do so, the property would not have been held on <b>constructive</b> <b>trust.</b> The third issue is who does the fiduciary owe duties to. In Boardman the case was concerning a trust, and it was held that the duties were towards the beneficiaries. Section 170 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that in situations concerning companies, the duties of the directors and other fiduciaries are to that company.|$|E

40|$|Do {{the terms}} of the Nigerian Land Use Act permit the {{application}} of equitable principles to transactions under it? More particularly, could equity be used to enforce null and void transactions under the Act? Although the Supreme Court answered these questions in the negative in Ajilo, other decisions of the Supreme Court, as well as some sections of the Act itself, suggest that the Act is not incompatible with equitable principles. Nor is it contrary to public policy to enforce null and void transactions under the Act through the intervention of equity. Two relevant equitable concepts are resulting and <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts.</b> While <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts</b> have found some fertile soil in Nigerian equity jurisprudence (despite the discordant tune in Ajilo), Nigerian courts seem to struggle with the principles of resulting trust. This article suggests that resulting and <b>constructive</b> <b>trusts</b> are proper instruments for the interpretation and application of the Act and that Ajilo should be overruled...|$|R
