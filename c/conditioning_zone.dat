40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} that {{photovoltaic}} (PV) panels have on the rooftop temperature in the EnergyPlus simulation environment were investigated for the following cases: with and without PV panels, with and without exposure to sunlight, and using roof materials with different thermal conductivities and for different climatic zones. The results demonstrate that heat transfer by convection, radiation, and conduction in the air gaps between PV panels and the building envelope can be simulated in the EnergyPlus environment when these air gaps are in the “air <b>conditioning</b> <b>zone.</b> ” Nevertheless, in most cases, particularly on the rooftop, the air gaps between the PV panels and the building envelope cannot be set as the “air <b>conditioning</b> <b>zone.</b> ” Therefore, in this case, none of the EnergyPlus models are appropriate to simulate the effect that PV panels have on the rooftop temperature. However, all {{the terms of the}} Heat Balance Model, including the absorbed direct and diffuse solar radiation, net long-wave radiation with the air and surroundings, convective exchange with the outside air, and conduction flux in or out of the surface, can still be used to calculate the temperature and heat flux within the BIPV’s air gap...|$|E

Airway epithelium is constantly presented with injurious signals, yet under healthy circumstances, the epithelium maintains its innate immune barrier and mucociliary elevator function. This suggests that airway epithelium has regenerative potential (I. R. Telford and C. F. Bridgman, 1990). In practice, however, airway regeneration is problematic because of slow turnover and dedifferentiation of epithelium thereby hindering regeneration and increasing time necessary for full maturation and function. Based on the anatomy and biology of the airway epithelium, a variety of tissue engineering tools available could be utilized to overcome the barriers currently seen in airway epithelial generation. This paper describes the structure, function, and repair mechanisms in native epithelium and highlights specific and manipulatable tissue engineering signals that could be of great use {{in the creation of}} artificial airway epithelium. 1. Structure and Function of Airway Epithelium in the Airway Tract The airway tract can be divided in two zones: the <b>conditioning</b> <b>zone</b> in which the inhaled air is cleaned, moistened, and transported to the distal part of the airways and th...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of controlled blasting experiments and blast modelling carried out to understand and quantify the effect of blasting on the creation of fractures inside fragments referred to as conditioning. Fragment conditioning is studied through the use of indirect and direct measurement techniques on samples collected from different zones around an explosive charge. Modelling is used to map different levels of conditioning throughout the blasted samples and explore the impact of boundary conditions on the spatial distribution of conditioning levels. Combined statistical analysis of repeatable tests showed that the measured impact breakage ranking parameter (A * b) increased by 20 and 33 % within the low and intermediate <b>conditioning</b> <b>zones</b> respectively. This translates into a statistically significant strength reduction of the material. These results in conjunction with other documented experience suggest that blast-induced conditioning can {{have a positive impact on}} comminution performance and thus energy consumption. Results from this work provide the basis for a methodology to better define post- blast breakage strength inputs into comminution performance models; as well as a preliminary approach to scale up the extent and degree of conditioning by blasting. Further work is required to evaluate the ability to control the degree of conditioning through the application of improvements in designs and novel blasting technolog...|$|R

Samples were incubated at 28 °C for 5 - 7 days on Malt Extract Agar with chloramphenicol (100 mg L- 1) {{and the results}} were expressed in colony forming units per cubic meter of air (CFU m- 3) or per gram of sample (CFU g- 1), respectively. Fungal genera and species were isolated and identified and the potential toxicogenic capacity of the Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium graminearum isolated was studied. Time-Place and Time-Product multifactorial ANOVA were carried out. After cleaning improvements, CFU m- 3 of air decreased as a function of time. Cladosporium and Alternaria were abundant in every zone, Aspergillus predominated in the wheat <b>conditioning</b> <b>zone</b> and Penicillium and Eurotium decreased with time. Wheat was more contaminated than grits and flour; Aspergillus, Eurotium and Mucoraceae family were the most abundant.

40|$|In {{one type}} of duct {{efficiency}} retrofit, additional insulation is added to a duct system that is already insulated. For example, a layer of R- 4 insulation might be: added to a duct system that already has R- 4 installed. It is possible that [...] either by chance or by design [...] the add-on layer, while not stopping duct leaks, might cause the leakage air to flow longitudinally for a distance, parallel to the duct, before it finds {{a way out of}} the newly added outer layer. This could happen by chance if the outer and inner layers of insulation have seams at different locations. Perhaps more usefully, if such longitudinal displacement of the leakage air turned out to be useful, it might be designed into the makeup of the outer insulation layer intended to be used in the retrofit. It is plausible that this leakage air might serve a useful function in keeping the insulation layer warmer (or, in the air-conditioning mode, cooler) than it would be in the absence of the leakage. By being held close to the ducts for a while, it might establish an artificially warmer (or cooler, in air <b>conditioning)</b> <b>zone</b> around the ducts. To the extent that this effect would reduce the heat losses from the ducts, the leakage should be credited with a ''thermal regain'' in the same way that leakage into buffer zones is credited with thermal regain when the leakage air warms (or cools) the buffer zone relative to the temperature it would have in the absence of such duct leakage. The purpose of this report is to investigate whether and to what extent such thermal regain exists. The model developed below applies to a situation where there are two distinct layers of insulation around the duct, with leakage air moving between them in a longitudinal direction for a distance before it finds its way out from the outer insulation layer. It may also apply approximately where there is a single insulation layer with an air barrier on the outside. Leakage air may pass into the insulation itself and thence longitudinally through the insulation material until it finds an opening in the air barrier through which it can escape...|$|E

It incorporates the building's thermal properties, local weather predictions, and a self-tuning stochastic occupancy model to reduce energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. Contrasting with existing approaches, the occupancy model requires no manual training and adapts to changes in occupancy patterns during operation. A prediction-weighted cost function provides <b>conditioning</b> of thermal <b>zones</b> before occupancy begins and reduces system output before occupancy ends. Simulation results with real-world occupancy data demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness. Comment: Energy and Buildings preprint, submitted July 2014, 27 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

These models {{take into account}} the type of use (e.g. visitors, events) and HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) climatisation to assess the indoor environment. Different software tools have been systematically evaluated and the most useful ones for historic buildings were Hambase [9, 10] and WUFIplus [8, 11, 12]. The results of hygrothermal whole building simulation cover the whole range of hourly energy demand for building <b>conditioning</b> for each <b>zone,</b> hourly indoor temperature and relative humidity for comfort and damage assessment as well as hygrothermal conditions on and in the envelope components to assess hygric issues like mould growth [8]. Thus, the full building simulations give a better representation of the hygrothermal performance of the building but this is at a high cost of developing the model and relatively long times for computing.|$|R

40|$|The robust use of {{horizontal}} wells in 3 D stratigraphic surface modeling {{is an important}} challenge. In many reservoir models there are inconsistencies between horizontal wells and the zonation of the 3 D model. The two main reasons for these inconsistencies are: 1) Zone log information is not fully used in {{the determination of the}} depth to the surfaces. 2) Well points (well picks) in deviated wells do not impact the depth of adjacent surfaces. A robust, geostatistical approach for ensuring the correct modeling of multiple stacked stratigraphic surfaces constrained by long horizontal wells is presented. Universal or Bayesian cokriging is used for prediction of surface depth based on a variety of data including well points, zone logs, isochores, and seismic travel times. Uncertainty in data are used to balance the influence of the various information sources. In contrast to standard approaches, all well data are treated simultaneously and will impact all surfaces. Basic concepts Surfaces are modeled as a sum of a trend and a residual. The trend captures the large scale (deterministic) shape of the surface and the residual captures deviations between the trend and the unknown true surface. Prediction and prediction error: Three simulated realizations: <b>Conditioning</b> on <b>zone</b> logs Multiple surfaces are linked together: • Interval thicknesses are specified • Surfaces are sum of thicknesses • Surfaces becomes inter-dependent Large spring indicates small uncertainty. The three columns show how the predicted top surface and associated prediction errors are modified when a deviated well is drilled into the lower zones. Cross section: Prediction...|$|R
40|$|General {{building}} energy simulation {{programs do}} not typically simulate interactions between HVAC systems and building envelopes. For this reason, a simulation tool which includes interactions between duct systems, building envelopes, and heating and cooling appliances in residential buildings has been developed. The simulation tool uses DOE- 2 (to model space <b>conditioning</b> loads and <b>zone</b> temperatures), COMIS (an airflow network solver), and a model of duct leakage and conduction losses. Three augmentations to the simulation tool are presented herein, along with sample results. These include: (1) modeling of steady-state thermosiphon flows in ducts, (2) improved simplified modeling of duct thermal mass effects, and (3) modeling of multi-speed space conditioning equipment. Multi-speed air conditioners are shown {{to be more sensitive}} to duct efficiency than single-speed equipment, because their efficiency decreases with increasing cooling load. Thermosiphon flows through duct systems are estimated to be 5 - 16 % of the total heating load, depending on the duct insulation level. The duct dynamics model indicates that duct thermal mass decreases the energy delivery efficiency of the distribution system by 1 - 6 percentage points...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of solar}} energy for {{domestic}} water heating and space heating {{has proved to}} be viable. Space cooling is another promising avenue for utilization of solar energy. Solar operated absorption air-conditioning systems, in different situations, {{have been found to be}} feasible. Such systems can make use of the expensive collectors which are, in any case, installed for water and space heating. In this paper the cooling of a prototype house, in Kufra, is reported. Starting with measured radiation and ambient data, calculations are performed on an hourly basis to determine the cooling load, radiation in the collector plane, heat delivered by the collectors and the heat stored in or discharged from the storage tank. Three different types of collectors with varying efficiencies are considered. These collectors are of the evacuated tube, selective coated and black painted types.

The work described here relates to the design, development and implementation of a centralized web application to serve that purpose. The CSUN facilities web application is an internal website that contains campus information such as building floor plans, tree locations and information, heating, ventilation and air <b>conditioning</b> (HVAC) <b>zone</b> data, and other facility attributes for use by FPDC and Physical Plant Management (PPM) (CSUN, 2013 a). The website was designed so FPDC and PPM could easily access and update their records on changes made to campus infrastructure, centralize their information into one system, and securely archive information for the productive management of campus facilities. In future the facilities website will be used to coordinate activities across campus units, in particular to incorporate CSUN class scheduling information so that schedulers can have access to plan drawings of buildings and rooms online; and to efficiently schedule classes to minimize resource use, such as heating and cooling. This project was funded by FPDC and CSUN's Institute for Sustainability and was developed by the author. Two web pages were created for the facilities website. One webpage is the website's home page that contains the campus map with building footprints over which building floor plans can be toggled on or off. The home page also contains the campus tree atlas, a measure tool, and imagery of the campus and surrounding area. The second webpage is almost identical; however, it allows the user to edit building and room information, and tree locations and data within the campus map. In its beta format the CSUN facilities website is being successfully used by FPDC. More applications and features are being added to the website to further utilize its potential and in future, parts of the website may be made accessible to faculty, staff and students. The website has the potential to decrease energy use on campus by coordinating building use with heating and cooling zones so empty rooms are not temperature controlled...|$|R

In the environment protection, which an unspoiled ecosystem is a condition of human living, it is needed to protect people and its property against the negative industrial influences. The mining activity influence on the environment belongs to the most negative industrial influences. As a result of underground mining of the mineral deposits in the surface creates the subsidence trough, i. e. caving zone (area) dangerous for the movement {{of people in this}} zone. Character and size of the subsidence on the surface depends mainly on depends mainly on the geotectonic ratios of rock massif above the mined out area. Knowing the extent of the subsidence trough in mining areas is determining to prevent the entry of persons into these danger <b>zones.</b> <b>Conditioning</b> factors to establish the extent of the movement of the earth's surface above the mined out area are a geodetic way surveyed deformation vectors which can be derived from the processing of measurements at monitoring stations based on these mining tangent territories. 3 D (three-dimensional) deformation vectors most adequately characterize movements of ground, buildings and other engineering structures above the mined out area.
