40|$|Based on {{the system}} of anionic delayed {{cross-link}} polymer gel type deep profile <b>control</b> <b>agent,</b> experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of long-term thermal stability, shearing resistance, and compatibility with natural debris of profile <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> and compatibility with ASP compound system. Besides, experiments are completed to simulate core displacement profile controlling and evaluate effect of oil displacement. Formula of anionic delayed cross-link polymer gel profile <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> with ideal long-term stability is confirmed. Profile control effect referred to core with diverse permeability and influence law of different injection time and injection rate on effect of oil displacement. Following conclusions are made according to the research. Long-term thermal stability, shearing resistance, and compatibility with natural debris of profile <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> and compatibility of ASP compound system of anionic delayed cross-link polymer gel profile <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> all have good performance, as well as core plugging effect and resistance to erosion. Displacing effect varies with the profile <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> injecting time, which shows, injection before polymer displacing proves the best, injection during polymer displacing the second, and injection after polymer displacing the worst. At the same time, the value of enhanced oil recovery increases with the injection rate of profile <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> increasing, however, when the rate comes {{to the point of}} 0. 1 pv, the increasing extent begins to slow down.

50|$|The Nanomorphic Cell {{model was}} applied to analyze the {{capabilities}} of an autonomous integrated microsystem {{on the order of}} the size of a living cell, i.e. a cube of 10 micrometer on a side 2. The function of this microsystem is, for example, upon injection into the body, to interact with living cells, e.g. determine the state of the cell and to support certain “therapeutic” action. It must have the capability to collect data on the living cell, analyze the data, and make a decision {{on the state of the}} living cell. It must also communicate with an external <b>controlling</b> <b>agent,</b> and possibly, take corrective action. Such a cell would need its own energy sources, sensors, computers, and communication devices, integrated into a complete system whose structure is dictated by the intended nanomorphic cell function. The Nanomorphic Cell can be considered as an extreme example of a class of systems known generically as Autonomous Microsystems, for example WIMS (Wireless Integrated Microsystems) 3, PicoNode 4, Lab-on-a-Pill 5 and Smartdust 6.|$|E
