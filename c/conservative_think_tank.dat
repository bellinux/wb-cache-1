5|$|In December 2004, a University of California, Los Angeles {{study by}} former fellows of a <b>{{conservative}}</b> <b>think</b> <b>tank</b> gave The New York Times {{a score of}} 73.7 on a 100-point scale, with 0 being most conservative and 100 being most liberal, making it the second-most liberal major newspaper in the study after The Wall Street Journal (85.1). The validity of the study has been questioned, however. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America pointed out potential conflicts of interest with the author's funding, and political scientists, such as Brendan Nyhan, cited flaws in the study's methodology.|$|E
40|$|This study's {{main finding}} is that C-SPAN {{coverage}} of <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> overwhelmingly favors <b>conservative</b> <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> while left-of-center <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> are under-represented. In 2006, <b>conservative</b> <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> received 43. 76 percent of total <b>think</b> <b>tank</b> coverage. Conservative/ libertarian and centrist <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> received 6. 94 percent and 31. 76 percent respectively. Center-left and progressive <b>think</b> <b>tanks,</b> on the other hand, only received 12. 73 percent and 4. 86 percent respectively. Thus, the combined <b>conservative</b> and conservative/libertarian <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> got an absolute majority of 50. 7 percent representation on C-SPAN. Everything left of center got only 17. 59 percent, just {{one third of the}} coverage received by the Right...|$|R

40|$|Conservative policy institutes have reevaluated their {{position}} regarding welfare {{and begun to}} present proposals to change social welfare policy. Instrumental in this development are the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation, <b>conservative</b> <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> which have developed projects {{for the purpose of}} making social policy more consonant with conservative philosophy. If progressive organizations are to reassert their role in the policy process, they will have to use some of the aggressive techniques pioneered by the <b>conservative</b> <b>think</b> <b>tanks...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} how political bias affects content in large daily newspapers {{and the source}} of the demand for that bias. Consistent with prior research, this paper finds media bias. The media examined are three to six times more likely to associate ideological labels with <b>conservative</b> <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> than liberal <b>think</b> <b>tanks.</b> This tends to frame the analysis done by <b>conservative</b> <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> as being less objective than the analysis done by liberal <b>think</b> <b>tanks.</b> A major contribution of this paper is identifying the source of bias. A detailed examination of the differences in the citation patterns across publications suggests that the sources of the bias are reporter/editor preferences rather than the preferences of publishers or customers...|$|R

25|$|In 1981, the Parti Québécois {{government}} redefined Hydro-Québec's mission by {{modifying the}} terms of the social pact of 1944. The government issued itself 43,741,090 shares worth C$100 each, and the amended statute stated that Hydro-Québec would now pay up to 75% of its net earnings in dividends. This amendment to the Hydro-Québec Act started an episodic debate on whether Hydro-Québec should be fully or partially privatized. In recent years, economist Marcel Boyer and businessman Claude Garcia—both associated with the <b>conservative</b> <b>think</b> <b>tank</b> The Montreal Economic Institute—have often raised the issue, claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower public debt.|$|E

Reno Supreme Court decision, favoring five white voters who said their rights had been infringed upon by redistricting that had been done to comply with the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
