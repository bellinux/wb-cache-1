5|$|Congenital liver abnormalities, such as Caroli's {{syndrome}} (a {{specific type}} of five recognized choledochal cysts), {{have been associated with}} an approximately 15% lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. The rare inherited disorders Lynch syndrome II and biliary papillomatosis have also been found to be associated with cholangiocarcinoma. The presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is not clearly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. However, intrahepatic stones (called hepatolithiasis), which are rare in the West but common in parts of Asia, have been strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. Exposure to Thorotrast, a form of thorium dioxide which was used as a radiologic <b>contrast</b> <b>medium,</b> has been linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma as late as 30–40 years after exposure; Thorotrast was banned in the United States in the 1950s due to its carcinogenicity.|$|E

25|$|A {{major problem}} for urban {{planning}} and effective public transit in Miami-Dade and South Florida {{is the fact that}} in terms of planning, {{it is one of the}} most sprawled out and automobile dependent metropolitan areas in the United States, with a lot of lowly <b>contrasted</b> <b>medium</b> density development spread throughout the area. For example, a very low percentage of the area's office space is located in the Central Business District (CBD) of Miami (only 13%, the lowest in the nation, in 1999). Additionally, there has been very little transit-oriented development (TOD). Subsequently, transit access between people and jobs in the city and region remains limited.|$|R

25|$|Computer-aided {{detection}} (CADe) {{systems are}} usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense {{structures in the}} soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions {{about the condition of}} the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in <b>contrast</b> <b>medium</b> uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.|$|E
25|$|An upper {{gastrointestinal}} series, {{also called}} an upper gastrointestinal study or contrast radiography {{of the upper}} gastrointestinal tract, {{is a series of}} radiographs used to examine the gastrointestinal tract for abnormalities. A <b>contrast</b> <b>medium,</b> usually a radiocontrast agent such as barium sulfate mixed with water, is ingested or instilled into the gastrointestinal tract, and X-rays are used to create radiographs of the regions of interest. The barium enhances the visibility of the relevant parts of the gastrointestinal tract by coating the inside wall of the tract and appearing white on the film. This in combination with other plain radiographs allows for the imaging of parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as the pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine such that the inside wall lining, size, shape, contour, and patency are visible to the examiner. With fluoroscopy, it is also possible to visualize the functional movement of examined organs such as swallowing, peristalsis, or sphincter closure. Depending on the organs to be examined, barium radiographs can be classified into barium swallow, barium meal, barium follow-through, and enteroclysis (small bowel enema). To further enhance the quality of images, air or gas is sometimes introduced into the gastrointestinal tract in addition to barium, and this procedure is called double-contrast imaging. In this case the gas {{is referred to as the}} negative <b>contrast</b> <b>medium.</b> Traditionally the images produced with barium contrast are made with plain-film radiography, but computed tomography is also used in combination with barium contrast, in which case the procedure is called CT enterography.|$|E
40|$|Renal {{ischemia}} {{and direct}} toxic effect of contrast media {{are the main}} confounding causes of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). The effect of different <b>contrast</b> <b>mediums</b> on the resistance of renal artery is quite unclear. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the resistive index (RI) changes of renal segmental artery in color Doppler duplex sonography after injection of two different contrast mediums: iodixanol and iohexol. The RI of the renal segmental artery of 62 randomly chosen patients, with a normal baseline renal function, was calculated using color-coded Doppler sonography before and five minutes after bolus injection of two different <b>contrast</b> <b>mediums.</b> Thirty-one patients were administered 50 mL of iodixanol (Visipaque) and 31 patients were admi-nistered 50 mL of iohexol (Omnipaque) during intravenous urogram procedures. The RI results were analyzed and compared in two groups using two-tailed t-test. The mean RI of renal segmental artery increased significantly after administration of contrast media (mean &#x 00 B 1; SD 0. 61 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 046 vs 0. 58 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 042; p< 0. 001). The mean change of RI was 0. 0387 &#x 00 B 1;. 00552 (mean &#x 00 B 1; SE) in the setting of iohexol injection and 0. 0216 &#x 00 B 1;. 00423 (mean &#x 00 B 1; SE) five minutes after administration of iodixanol (p= 0. 017). Both non-ionic iso-osmolar dimeric iodixanol and low-osmolar iohexol increase the renal artery resistance, but the changes are more dramatic with iohexol, suggesting better tolerance with iodixanol...|$|R

We {{study the}} {{behavior}} of steady state voltage potentials in a bidimensional highly <b>contrasted</b> <b>medium</b> composed of a conducting cytoplasm surrounded by an insulating membrane of thickness h. We provide a rigorous derivation {{of the first two}} terms of the asymptotic expansion of steady state voltage potentials as h tends to zero. The first two terms of the potential in the membrane are given explicitly in local coordinates in terms of the boundary data, while the first terms of the cytoplasmic potential are the solutions of the so-called dielectric formulation with appropriate boundary conditions given in terms of the boundary data. The error estimates are given in terms of the conductivities and of the boundary data...|$|R
50|$|Typical {{administration}} {{involves a}} pill or liquid containing sodium iodide (NaI) taken orally, which contains {{a small amount}} of iodine-131, amounting to perhaps less than a grain of salt. A 2-hour fast of no food prior to and for 1 hour after ingesting the pill is required. This low dose of radioiodine is typically tolerated by individuals otherwise allergic to iodine (such as those unable to tolerate <b>contrast</b> <b>mediums</b> containing larger doses of iodine such as used in CT scan, intravenous pyelogram (IVP), and similar imaging diagnostic procedures). Excess radioiodine that does not get absorbed into the thyroid gland is eliminated by the body in urine. Some patients may experience a slight allergic reaction to the diagnostic radioiodine and may be given an antihistamine.|$|R

[...] Cardiac catheterization was first performed when Werner Forssmann, in 1929, created an incision in one of his left antecubital veins and inserted a catheter into his venous system. [...] He then guided the catheter by fluoroscopy into his right atrium. [...] Subsequently, he walked up a flight of stairs to the radiology department and documented the procedure by having a chest roentgenogram performed. [...] Over the next year, catheters were placed in a similar manner into the right ventricle, and measurements of pressure and cardiac output (using the Fick principle) were performed.|$|E
2500|$|Contrast echocardiography, or Contrast-enhanced {{ultrasound}} is {{the addition}} of ultrasound <b>contrast</b> <b>medium,</b> or imaging agent, to traditional ultrasonography. The ultrasound contrast {{is made up of}} tiny microbubbles filled with a gas core and protein shell. This allows the microbubbles to circulate through the cardiovascular system and return the ultrasound waves creating a highly reflective image. There are multiple applications in which contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be useful. The most commonly used application is in the enhancement of LV endocardial borders for assessment of global and regional systolic function. Contrast may also be used to enhance visualization of wall thickening during stress echocardiography, for the assessment of LV thrombus, or for the assessment of other masses in the heart. Contrast echocardiography has also been used to assess blood perfusion throughout myocardium in the case of coronary artery disease.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Contrast</b> <b>mediums</b> {{used for}} X-ray CT, {{as well as}} for plain film X-ray, are called radiocontrasts. Radiocontrasts for X-ray CT are, in general, iodine-based. This is useful to {{highlight}} structures such as blood vessels that otherwise would be difficult to delineate from their surroundings. Using contrast material can also help to obtain functional information about tissues. Often, images are taken both with and without radiocontrast. CT images are called precontrast or native-phase images before any radiocontrast has been administrated, and postcontrast after radiocontrast administration. Depending on the purpose of the investigation, there are standardized protocols for time intervals between intravenous radiocontrast administration and image acquisition, in order to visualize the dynamics of contrast enhancements in different organs and tissues. The main phases thereof are: ...|$|R

2500|$|This test may {{be done in}} a {{hospital}} or clinic. The patient lies on the X-ray table and a preliminary X-ray is taken. The patient is then asked to lie on the side while a well lubricated enema tube is inserted into the rectum. As the enema enters the body, the patient might have the sensation that they have to have a bowel movement. The barium sulfate, a radiodense (shows as white on X-ray) <b>contrast</b> <b>medium,</b> is then allowed to flow into the colon. A large balloon {{at the tip of the}} enema tube may be inflated to help keep the barium sulfate inside. The flow of the barium sulfate is monitored by the health care provider on an X-ray fluoroscope screen (like a TV monitor). Air may be puffed into the colon to distend it and provide better images (often called a [...] "double-contrast" [...] exam). If air is used, the enema tube will be reinserted if it had been removed and a small amount of air will be introduced into the colon, and more X-ray pictures are taken.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{diagnosis}} can be difficult, {{especially when}} other severe injuries are present; thus {{the condition is}} commonly diagnosed late. Chest X-ray {{is known to be}} unreliable in diagnosing diaphragmatic rupture; it has low sensitivity and specificity for the injury. [...] Often another injury such as pulmonary contusion masks the injury on the X-ray film. [...] Half the time, initial X-rays are normal; in most of those that are not, hemothorax or pneumothorax is present. However, there are signs detectable on X-ray films that indicate the injury. [...] On an X-ray, the diaphragm may appear higher than normal. [...] Gas bubbles may appear in the chest, and the mediastinum may appear shifted to the side. A nasogastric tube from the stomach may appear on the film in the chest cavity; this sign is pathognomonic for diaphragmatic rupture, but it is rare. [...] A <b>contrast</b> <b>medium</b> that shows up on X-ray can be inserted through the nasogastric tube to make a diagnosis. [...] The X-ray is better able to detect the injury when taken from the back with the patient upright, but this is not usually possible because the patient is usually not stable enough; thus it is usually taken from the front with the patient lying supine. Positive pressure ventilation helps keep the abdominal organs from herniating into the chest cavity, but this also can prevent the injury from being discovered on an X-ray.|$|E

This is administered to a patient in capsule form, by intravenous injection, or (less commonly due to problems involved in a spill) in a drink. (131I is usually administered in a drink, due to the heavy radiation dose to local tissues which results before a capsule could dissolve). The iodine is taken up by the thyroid gland and a gamma camera is used to functional images of the thyroid for diagnosis. Quantitative measurements of the thyroid can be performed to calculate the iodine uptake (absorption) for the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Dosing can vary; a small dose can start at 11.1 MBq µCi, while it is commonly an amount such as 2-4 mCi.

40|$|International audienceIn this letter, {{we report}} the {{presence}} of a localized Doppler anomaly occurring during the focusing of a Radarsat- 2 data set acquired on the Merapi volcano (Indonesia) during the devastating 2010 eruption. The Doppler anomaly is manifested as similar to 3 -km-wide bull's-eye-shaped azimuth pixel shifts between two subaperture images. The Doppler anomaly is centered on the summit-south flank of the Merapi volcano. The pixel shifts reach up to 11. 6 m. Since the Merapi volcano was undergoing a large eruption during the data acquisition, it is possible that there is a volcano-related phenomenon that has delayed the radar signal so much to create measurable pixel offsets within a single synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data set, similar, but more extensive, to the signal generated by targets motions; similar, but less extensive, to the signal generated by ionospheric perturbations. It is known that the SAR signal is delayed as it passes through heterogeneous layers of the atmosphere, but this delay typically affects the SAR signal to a fraction of the phase cycle or few centimeters depending on the radar wavelength employed by the system. We investigate the source of this anomalous metric signal; we review the theoretical basis of SAR image focusing, and we try to provide a consistent physical framework to our observations. Our results are compatible with the SAR signal being perturbed during the actual process of image focusing by {{the presence of}} a <b>contrasting</b> <b>medium</b> located approximately between 6 - and 12. 5 -km altitude, which we propose being associated with the presence of volcanic ash plume...|$|R
