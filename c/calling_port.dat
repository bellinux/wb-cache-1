40|$|The Tutte {{equations}} are ported (or set-pointed) {{when the}} equations F(N) = geF(N/e) + reF(N e) are omitted for elements e in a distinguished set <b>called</b> <b>ports.</b> The solutions F, <b>called</b> <b>ported</b> Tutte functions, can distinguish different orientations {{of the same}} matroid. A ported extensor with ground set is a (fully) decomposable element in the exterior algebra (of antisymmetric tensors) over a vector space with a given basis, called the ground set, containing a distinguished subset <b>called</b> <b>ports.</b> A ported extensor {{is one way to}} present a linearly representable ported matroid or oriented matroid. There are extensor operations corresponding to oriented matroid dualization, and to deletions and contractions. We define a ported extensor function by means of dualization, port element renaming, exterior multiplication, and then contraction of all non-port elements. The main result is that this function satisfies a sign-corrected variant of the Tutte equations in which deletion and contraction are extensor operations, and addition and the anticommutative multiplication belong to an exterior algebra rather tha...|$|R
