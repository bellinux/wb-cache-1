Especially versatile methods included the addition of halogens to alkenes, hydrohalogenation of alkenes, and the conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides. These methods are so reliable and so easily implemented that haloalkanes became cheaply available for use in industrial chemistry because the halide could be further replaced by other functional groups.|$|E

The first reported application of bioaugmentation for chlorinated ethenes was at Kelly Air Force Base, TX.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the biotransformation pathways of 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane (1, 1, 2, 2 -TeCA) {{in the presence of}} chloroethenes (i. e. tetrachloroethene, PCE; trichloroethene, TCE) in anaerobic microcosms constructed with subsurface soil and groundwater from a contaminated site. When amended with yeast extract, lactate, butyrate, or H- 2 and acetate, 1, 1, 2, 2 -TeCA was initially dechlorinated via both hydrogen-olysis to 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane (1, 1, 2 -TCA) (major pathway) and dichloroelimination to dichloroethenes (DCEs) (minor pathway), with both reactions occurring under sulfidogenic conditions. In the presence of only H- 2, the hydrogenolysis of 1, 1, 2, 2 -TeCA to 1, 1, 2 -TCA apparently required the presence of acetate to occur. Once formed, 1, 1, 2 -TCA was degraded predominantly via dichloroelimination to vinyl chloride (VC). Ultimately, <b>chloroethanes</b> were converted to chloroethenes (mainly VC and DCEs) which persisted in the microcosms for very long periods along with PCE and TCE originally present in the groundwater. Hydrogenolysis of chloroethenes occurred only after highly reducing methanogenic conditions were established. However, substantial conversion to ethene (ETH) was observed only in microcosms amended with yeast extract (200 mg/l), suggesting that groundwater lacked some nutritional factors which were likely provided to dechlorinating microorganisms by this complex organic substrate. Bioaugmentation with an H- 2 -utilizing PCE-dechlorinating Dehalococcoides spp. -containing culture resulted in the conversion of 1, 1, 2, 2 -TeCA, PCE and TCE to ETH and VC.

40|$|Ion {{chemistry}} at {{atmospheric pressure}} is of major relevance to novel methods for the abatement of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) that employ non-thermal plasmas. For this reason, positive and negative APCI (atmospheric pressure chemical ionization) mass spectra of all six di-, tri- and tetrachloroethanes diluted in air (500 - 1500 ppm) at atmospheric pressure were investigated at 30 °C and at 300 °C. Spectral changes due to collisional activation of the ions achieved by increasing δV, the potential difference between sampling and skimmer cones, are informative of structures and ion-molecule reactions. Positive ion chemistry of the <b>chloroethanes</b> (M) can, in general, be ascribed to C-C and C-Cl cleavages of the molecular ion, M+•, never detected but likely formed via exothermic charge exchange from primary ions of the APCI plasma. Exceptions to this characteristic pattern were observed for 1, 1 -dichloroethane and 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane, which give [M - H]+ and [M - HCl]+• species, respectively. It is suggested that both such species are due to ionization via hydride transfer. Upon increasing δV, the [M - HCl]+• ion formed from 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane undergoes the same fragmentation and ion-molecule reactions previously reported for trichloroethene. A nucleophilic reaction of water within the [C 2 H 4 Cl+](H 2 O) n ionic complexes to displace HCl is postulated {{to account for the}} [C 2 H 5 O+](H 2 O) m species observed in the positive APCI spectra of the dichloroethanes. Negative ion spectra are, for all investigated <b>chloroethanes,</b> dominated by Cl- and its ion-neutral complexes with one, two and, in some cases, three molecules of the neutral precursor and/or water. Another common feature is the formation of species (X-) (M) n where X- is a background ion of the APCI plasma, namely O 2 -,O 3 - and, in some cases, (NO) 2 -. Peculiar to 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane are species attributed to Cl- complexes with phosgene, (Cl-) (Cl 2 C=O) n(n = 1, 2). Such complexes, which were not observed for either the isomeric 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane or for the tetrachloroethanes, are of interest as oxidation intermediates in the corona-induced decomposition process.

At present, the US Environmental Protection Agency is carrying out the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP), where 1, 2 -dichloroethane (DCA) and 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane (TCA) are considered as priorities for their potential effects on the endocrine system. DCA {{is also found in}} the list of priority substances drawn up by the European Commission. To avoid the release of <b>chloroethanes</b> into the aqueous environment, powerful water treatment technologies such as the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) must be applied in the wastewater treatment facilities. Among them, electrochemical AOPs (EAOPs) such as anodic oxidation (AO) and electro-Fenton (EF) processes have gained much interest for the removal of organic compounds due to their outstanding technical characteristics and the reduced use of expensive chemicals. Here, acidic aqueous solutions of DCA and TCA have been treated by the EF and AO processes. Bulk electrolyses were performed at constant current using a BDD anode and an air diffusion cathode (ADE) able to generate H 2 O 2 in situ, which reacts with added Fe 2 + to yield •OH from Fenton’s reaction. At 300 mA, almost total mineralization was achieved at 420 min for solutions containing 4 mM of either DCA or TCA. Comparative treatments without Fe 2 + (AO) or with a Pt anode led to a poorer mineralization. The better performance of the EF process with BDD is explained by the synergistic action of the oxidizing radicals, BDD(•OH) at the anode surface and •OH in the bulk, and the minimization of diffusional limitations. The decay of the initial pollutant accomplished with pseudo first-order kinetics. Chloroacetic and dichloroacetic acids were the major by-products during the degradation of DCA and TCA, respectively. Acetic, oxalic and formic acids were also identified. The proposed reaction pathways include oxidative and reductive (cathodic) dechlorination steps. Chlorine was released as Cl, being further oxidized to ClO 3  and, mostly, to ClO 4 , due to the action of the largely generated BDD(•OH) and •OH. In conclusion, it has been proven that EF with a BDD/ADE cell is a very effective technology for the decontamination of single and multicomponent DCA and TCA aqueous solutions, which is encouraging to proceed with the treatment of real waters...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In situ {{chemical}} oxidation is a {{frequently used}} remedial approach {{for the destruction}} of chlorinated ethenes such as tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE). However, treatment of more recalcitrant <b>chloroethanes</b> and chloromethanes have challenged traditional oxidation reagents. Recently, new methods of sodium persulfate reagent activation have been developed and these systems have shown promise for improved treatment performance. The new methods of persulfate activation use chelated metals, such as iron (II) ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid [Fe+ 2 (EDTA) ], hydrogen peroxide addition or alkaline conditions by addition of base. Both the mixed persulfate/peroxide and the alkaline persulfate reagent systems have shown the ability to treat the more recalcitrant chlorinated methanes and ethanes. In this study the new methods of persulfate activation have been investigated in bench tests on soil/water mixtures from a site with carbon tetrachloride (CT) and chloroform (CF) contamination.

In order to elucidate the microbial origin of this bioconversion, enrichment cultures of the methanogenic sludge were prepared with different carbon and electron sources: pyruvate, lactate, H 2 /CO 2, ethanol and formate. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was the strong reductant in order to increase the negative redox potential in the media. A homo-acetogenic gram-positive strain could be isolated in the presence of formate. 16 S rRNA of the isolated strain showed that the bacterium was closely related (99. 7 %) to Acetobacterium wieringae. The strain also grew on pyruvate, lactate, H 2 /CO 2 and ethanol, although dechlorination rates of 1, 2 -DCA were at least 5 times higher when formate was the (only) electron source.

Les expériences ont été réalisées en réacteur statique, avec une Lampe basse {{pression}} à vapeur de mercure et avec des concentrations initiales en produit chloré de l'ordre de 10 - 6 mol l- 1 et en H 202 comprises entre 10 - 5 et 10 - 3 mol L-. Les résultats montrent que le système H 202 /UV peut oxyder les composés organochlorés étudiés à l'exception des composés ne possédant pas d'atome d'hydrogène (CCL 4 et C 2 CL 6). Les rendements d'oxydation obtenus avec Le réacteur utilisé dépendent du temps de réaction, de la concentration initiale en H 202, du flux photonique et peuvent être nettement diminués par la présence de pièges à radicaux (ions bicarbonates) dans le milieu réactionnel. Par ailleurs, une étude cinétique de la photolyse du peroxyde d'hydrogène en absence de matière organique est également présentée. The aim of {{this work}} was to study oxidation of certain volatile polychlorinated hydrocarbons, using hydrogen peroxide photoactivated by UV. This research was carried out with different mixtures of diluted aqueous solutions of chloromethanes (CHCl 3, CCl 4) and <b>chloroethanes</b> (C 2 H 3 Cl 3, C 2 H 2 Cl 4, C 2 HCl 5, CCl 6), which are typical halogenated compounds most frequently found in contaminated groundwater. The effect of the hydrogen peroxide concentration, the light intensity and the bicarbonate concentration on the rate of 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane (TCE) oxidation was determined. A kinetic study on hydrogen peroxide photolysis in a solution free of organic compounds was also carried out. EXPERIMENTATIONExperiments were conducted in a batch reactor (V = 4 l), equipped with an immersed mercury low-pressure lamp. The intensity emitted at 253. 7 nm was roughly 2 1019 photons s- 1. The temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained with a regulation system at 16 ± 0. 5 °C (figure 1). The solutions were prepared in a phosphate buffer µ = 2 10 - 2 M, pH = 7. 5). The outer surface of the lamp was masked with strips of aluminium, so as to obtain various percentages of initial energy (20 to 100 %). The concentration of the hydrogen peroxide of the samples was determined by spectrophotometry and the chlorinated compounds were analysed by electron capture gas chromatography. RESULTKinetics of hydrogen peroxide photolysis : H 202 was decomposed by UV tb produce two hydroxyl radicals. In diluted solutions ([H 202] < 10 - 3 M), the concentration decreases in accordante with a first order law. The rate constant depends on the initial light intensity (Io), {{on the characteristics of}} the reactor (volume and distance between the lamp and the watt. of the reactor) and on the motar extinction coefficient of the irradiated solution (equation C). The decomposition rate appears to be dependent on pH, the rate of constant rire {{has been found to be}} proportional to the dissociation of hydrogen peroxide into its basic form (EH 2 O 2 = 20 mol- 1 cm- 1,EH 2 O 2 _ = 240 mol- 1 cm- 1) (figure 2 and 3). Oxidation of the chlorinated compounds : H 202 /UV is very efficient for the removal of organic compounds. Preliminary experiments showed that both UV and H 2 O 2 treatments do not decompose halogenated compounds. Hydroxyl radicals are extremly reactive and attack organic compounds preferentialty by abs-tracting a hydrogen atom from an organic molecule. This is confirmed by the results which show that chloromethanes and <b>chloroethanes</b> with an H atom are eliminated, but net compounds such as tetrachloride and hexachloroethane (figure 4 to 7). The effectiveness of an H 202 /UV system depends on various parameters. Studies on the TCE elimination show that the oxidation yields an increase when the reaction time, the UV irradiation dose (figure 9 b) and the hydrogen peroxide concentration (figure 8) increase.

40|$|The {{effect of}} water on the {{reduction}} of aliphatic chlorides at silver cathodes was investigated by cyclovoltammetric experiments in acetonitrile, water and their mixture and focused electrolyses in water solutions. The addition of water to acetonitrile gives rise to the formation of new peaks and/or the displacement of pre-existent peaks at dramatically less negative potentials. In a water medium, silver shows a very large electrocatalytic effect towards the reduction of chlorinated aliphatic compounds belonging to the classes of chloromethanes, <b>chloroethanes</b> and chloroethenes, dramatically higher than that observed in aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or acetonitrile (ACN). As an example, for 1, 2 -dichloroethane, a peak at about - 2. 5 V and - 0. 9 V vs. SCE are observed in acetonitrile and water, respectively. It was observed that the reduction at silver cathodes of most of the investigated compounds occurs in water medium at less negative potentials with respect to the water discharge, thus allowing their direct reduction and opening interesting perspectives for the electrochemical detection and abatement of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons in water.

40|$|This is an author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] features of small-molecule photoelectron spectroscopy are considered (1) The atom from which a photoelectron is emitted must have a recoil momentum equal to that of the emitted electron. This is shared among the various modes of motion of the ion, leading to rotational and vibrational excitation. Furthermore, any initial velocity of the atom (due to either translational, rotational, or vibrational motion) will lead to Doppler broadening. These effects are observable and can, in general, be accounted for by simple models. In some cases, however, the simple models fail and a deeper insight is necessary. (2) Inner-shell photoionization is essentially an atomic process, and it is expected that the intensity for emission of a photoelectron from the core of an atom in a molecule will be independent of its chemical environment. Recent measurements on the carbon 1 s photoelectron spectra of three <b>chloroethanes</b> show {{that this is not the}} case. At energies not far above the ionization threshold there are strong oscillations of the intensity ratio (C[subscript Cl]/C[subscript H]) with increasing photon energy. These are similar to those seen in EXAFS and can be accounted for by considering backscattering of the photoelectrons from the chlorine atoms. Moreover, even at high energies the cross section for ionization has been found to depend on the chemical environment of the atom. These results have important consequences for the use of inner-shell electron spectroscopy for quantitative analysis. (3) Single-core-hole ionization energies have long been used as a tool for investigating chemical phenomena. Double-core-hole ionization energies provide additional chemical information. By combining the single-hole and double-hole ionization energies it is possible to determine the effects of the initial-state charge distribution and final-state charge rearrangement on the chemical shifts and on other chemical properties. Until recently double-core-hole ionization energies have not been experimentally accessible for first-row elements. New experimental techniques have, however, made it possible to measure these not only for single sites in a molecule, but also for two different sites in the same molecule. The chemical information that can be obtained from such measurements is discussed...|$|R
