Between 1884 and 1885, European nations {{met at the}} Berlin West Africa Conference to discuss the partitioning of Africa. It was agreed that European claims to parts of Africa would only be recognised if Europeans provided effective occupation.

25|$|He {{traveled}} to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, {{to collaborate with}} playwright Paul Green on a dramatic adaptation of Native Son. In January 1941 Wright received the prestigious Spingarn Medal of the NAACP for noteworthy achievement. His play Native Son opened on Broadway in March 1941, with Orson Welles as director, to generally favorable reviews. Wright also wrote the text to accompany a volume of photographs chosen by Rosskam, which were almost <b>completely</b> <b>drawn</b> from the files of the Farm Security Administration. The FSA had employed top photographers to travel {{around the country and}} capture images of Americans. Their collaboration, Twelve Million Black Voices: A Folk History of the Negro in the United States, was published in October 1941 to wide critical acclaim.|$|E
25|$|Some manga are <b>completely</b> <b>drawn</b> in the bishonen style, such as Saint Seiya. Bishōnen manga are {{generally}} shōjo manga (girls' comics) or yaoi (girls' comics focused on homosexual relationships between beautiful boys), however shōnen manga (boy's comics) may use casts of bishōnen characters for crossover appeal to female readers. Mainstream shounen and seinen fare also often uses such characters as rivals for a traditional masculine protagonist, {{with some degree}} of comic relief, or for the blander everyman, whether as the embodiment of his insecurities in a grittier realism, or as a more lighthearted constant reminder of his less than advantageous social status and the constraints thereof. Comics for younger boys tend to use arrogant bishounen {{in the role of the}} recurring minor rivals readers love to hate, though their effeminate good looks there will often appear older, bigger, stronger, and thus in fact more masculine than the commonly shorter and less mature protagonists.|$|E

60|$|The {{next day}} but one, being the 7th of September, before day the army marched from Dieben {{to a large}} field {{about a mile from}} Leipsic, where we found Tilly's army in full battalia in admirable order, which made a show both glorious and terrible. Tilly, like a fair gamester, had taken up but one side of the plain, and left the other free, and all the avenues open for the king's army; nor did he stir to the charge till the king's army was <b>completely</b> <b>drawn</b> up and {{advanced}} toward him. He had in his army 44,000 old soldiers, every way answerable to what I have said of them before; and I shall only add, a better army, I believe, never was so soundly beaten.|$|E
60|$|Now observe, {{all these}} archivolts, without exception, {{assume that the}} spectator looks from the outside only: none are {{complete}} on both sides; they are essentially window mouldings, and have no resemblance to those of our perfect Gothic arches prepared for traceries. If they were all <b>completely</b> <b>drawn</b> in the plate, they should be as fig. 25, having a great depth of wall behind the mouldings, but it was useless to represent this in every case. The Ducal Palace begins to show mouldings on both sides, 28, 31; and 35 is a complete arch moulding from the apse of the Frari. That moulding, though so perfectly developed, is earlier than the Ducal Palace, and with other features of the building, indicates the completeness of the Gothic system, which made {{the architect of the}} Ducal Palace found his work principally upon that church.|$|E
6000|$|... § 20. The {{quantity}} of admissible transgression of law {{varies with the}} degree in which the ornamentation involves or admits imitation of nature. Thus, if these ivy leaves in Fig. 99 were <b>completely</b> <b>drawn</b> in light and shade, {{they would not be}} properly connected with the more or less regular sequences of the scroll; and in every subordinate ornament, something like complete symmetry may be admitted, as in bead mouldings, chequerings, &c. Also, {{the ways in which the}} transgression may be granted vary infinitely; in the finest compositions it is perpetual, and yet so balanced and atoned for as always to bring about more beauty than if there had been no transgression. In a truly fine mountain or organic line, if it is looked at in detail, no one would believe in its being a continuous curve, or being subjected to any fixed law. It seems broken, and bending a thousand ways; perfectly free and wild, and yielding to every impulse. But, after following with the eye three or four of its impulses, we shall begin to trace some strange order among them; every added movement will make the ruling intent clearer; and when the whole life of the line is revealed at last, it will be found to have been, throughout, as obedient to the true law of its course as the stars in their orbits.|$|E

50|$|All works {{realised}} {{under the}} name of Hergé since 1950 can be considered as works of the Studios. This is a non-exhaustive list of those works where the Studios played a major role, either by colouring, drawing of backgrounds, or by completely replacing Hergé. However, it is difficult to correctly judge the role of the contributors, as Hergé and, later, his rights-holders minimized their work. There is debate over a number of albums, mainly Tintin and the Picaros and the third version of The Black Island, where some believe that Bob De Moor <b>completely</b> <b>drew</b> the whole book. With the Jo, Zette and Jocko adventure The Valley of the Cobras, Jacques Martin is sometimes said to have drawn the whole of the album.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, while Antony was thus wasting {{his time in}} luxury and {{pleasure}} with Cleopatra, his public duties were neglected, and every thing was getting into confusion. Fulvia remained in Italy. Her position and her character gave her a commanding political influence, and she exerted herself in a very energetic manner to sustain, in that quarter of the world, the interests of her husband's cause. She was surrounded with difficulties and dangers, the details of which can not, however, be here particularly described. She wrote continually to Antony, urgently entreating {{him to come to}} Rome, and displaying in her letters all those marks of agitation and distress which a wife would naturally feel under the circumstances in which she was placed. The thought that her husband had been so <b>completely</b> <b>drawn</b> away from her by the guilty arts of such a woman, and led by her to abandon his wife and his family, and leave in neglect and confusion concerns of such momentous magnitude as those which demanded his attention at home, produced an excitement in her mind bordering upon frensy. Antony was at length so far influenced by the urgency of the case that he determined to return. He broke up his quarters at Tarsus and moved south toward Tyre, which was a great naval port and station in those days. Cleopatra went with him. They were to separate at Tyre. She was to embark there for Egypt, and he for Rome.|$|E
6000|$|... § 7. An {{infinite}} number of different lines, more or less violent in curvature according to the measurements we adopt in designing them, are included, or defined, by each of the laws just explained. But the number of these laws themselves is also infinite. There is no limit to the multitude of conditions which may be invented, each producing a group of curves of a certain common nature. Some of these laws, indeed, produce single curves, which, like the circle, can vary only in size; but, for the most part, they vary also, like the lines we have just traced, in the rapidity of their curvature. Among these innumerable lines, however, there is one source of difference in character which divides them, infinite {{as they are in}} number, into two great classes. The first class consists of those which are limited in their course, either ending abruptly, or returning to some point from which they set out; the second class, of those lines whose nature is to proceed for ever into space. Any portion of a circle, for instance, is, by the law of its being, compelled, if it continue its course, to return to the point from which it set out; so also any portion of the oval curve (called an ellipse), produced by cutting a cylinder obliquely across. And if a single point be marked on the rim of a carriage wheel, this point, as the wheel rolls along the road, will trace a curve in the air from one part of the road to another, which is called a cycloid, and to which the law of its existence appoints that it shall always follow a similar course, and be terminated by the level line on which the wheel rolls. All such curves are of inferior beauty: and the curves which are incapable of being <b>completely</b> <b>drawn,</b> because, as in the two cases above given, the law of their being supposes them to proceed for ever into space, are of a higher beauty.|$|E

500|$|Written {{solely in}} first person, [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] explores {{the themes of}} freedom and self-expression, {{approached}} by sultry lyrics. It puts emphasis to how she cannot be changed or molded into being something she is not. In the verses, Cyrus addresses confidence and the attempt to discover for what she is yearning for, respectively. Choruses have Cyrus shouting the title and variations {{of it in a}} repetitive manner, against the beat of the song. Monica Herrera of Billboard interpreted the lyrics [...] "If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya / I'm not here to sell ya" [...] to be an official declaration of rebellion in order to dispose herself of tween role-model responsibilities. Likewise, various other critics believed [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] spoke of her <b>completely</b> <b>drawing</b> away from the image she had developed through Hannah Montana, which first aired in March 2006.|$|R

The first issue was released on April 24, 2013, but due to delays, issue 4 was not published until January 1, 2014, and issue 5 was not published until January 2015.

Gornt paid for her education until she was 18, at which time she became his mistress. Orlanda entertains Linc Bartlett during his time in Hong Kong, and the question arises as to whether she is truly interested in the CEO of Par-Con, or merely seducing Bartlett into taking Gornt's side against the Noble House.

5000|$|Equipment changed radically {{during the}} 1990s, when {{computer-aided}} design almost <b>completely</b> ousted <b>drawing</b> by hand.

50|$|In October 2012 Millar {{stated that}} his {{intention}} {{for the series}} was to have it produced {{as closely as possible}} to a monthly schedule, which he predicted would mean an issue published every six weeks, and that after the first five issues, which represents Book One of the story, there would be a break of a few months for the creative team to catch up, before resuming with the second half. Millar announced that the entire series would be released over the course of 20 months, for 10 - 12 issues in total.

50|$|The {{greatest}} {{outburst of}} Lake Agassiz {{happened to be}} its last drawdown, occurring about 8.4 ka calendar years when it had joined glacial Lake Ojibway. Lake Ojibway was located on the Laurentide Ice Sheet margin in the southeastern portion of the Hudson Bay basin. The total surface area of the merged lake was approximately 841,000 km2. The outburst {{was caused by a}} breach in the ice sheet over the Hudson Bay, and it is estimated that if this lake was <b>completely</b> <b>drawn</b> down from its maximum depth, about 163,000 km3 of water would be released into the North Atlantic Ocean in {{a very short period of}} time. Given the fact that the outflow channel for this case was not nearly as narrow as in other outbursts, it is likely that the lake indeed drew down very rapidly. If the outburst occurred in one year, the flux is estimated to be 5.2 Sv.|$|E
