5|$|In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a Texas {{law against}} {{same-sex}} sexual intercourse violated {{the right to}} privacy. In Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the Court ruled that the fundamental right to marriage included same-sex couples being able to marry.|$|E
5|$|Though the act won easy {{passage through}} the Social Credit-dominated legislature, Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta John C. Bowen {{reserved}} royal assent until the Supreme Court of Canada evaluated the act's legality. In 1938's Reference re Alberta Statutes, the <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it was unconstitutional, and it never became law.|$|E
50|$|However, the <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> both agents did not entrap the suspects.|$|R
50|$|At {{trial and}} on appeal, the <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{if there ever}} was {{aboriginal}} title in the land it was surely extinguished.|$|R
50|$|Serrano v. Priest a post-Rodriguez {{decision}} in which California <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{the method of}} funding schools violated the California Constitution's equal protection clause.|$|R
5|$|All were NAACP-sponsored cases. The Davis case, {{the only}} {{case of the}} five {{originating}} from a student protest, began when 16-year-old Barbara Rose Johns organized and led a 450-student walkout of Moton High School. The Gebhart case {{was the only one}} where a trial court, affirmed by the Delaware Supreme <b>Court,</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> discrimination was unlawful; in all the other cases the plaintiffs had lost as the original courts had found discrimination to be lawful.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{held that}} the plaintiffs lacked locus standi to bring the action as {{they were not the}} temple's legal owners. In any case, as there was {{evidence}} that the authorities had rational reasons for treating the temple property differently from the property of the Mission and the Church, the High <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> there had been no breach of Article 12(1). Furthermore, the Court determined that the plaintiffs were guilty of inordinate delay in bringing the action.|$|E
5|$|Abramski v. United States, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> making {{arrangements}} for a straw purchase of a gun is in violation of the Gun Control Act of 1968, and is different from re-selling or gifting a previously purchased gun. In the Abramski case, a former police officer from Virginia took advantage of a local discount to buy a gun for his uncle and later transferred it to Pennsylvania—the uncle's residence—using the appropriate federal procedure. During the purchase, Abramski falsely declared that he is purchasing the gun for himself.|$|E
50|$|In Hayburn's Case, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 408 (1792), federal circuit courts held {{an act of}} Congress unconstitutional for {{the first}} time. Three federal circuit <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Congress had {{violated}} the Constitution by passing an act requiring circuit court judges to decide pension applications, subject to {{the review of the}} Secretary of War. These circuit <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> this was not a proper judicial function under Article III. These three decisions were appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeals became moot when Congress repealed the statute while the appeals were pending.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, Intel {{alleged that}} Cyrix had infringed several patents and {{initiated}} legal action. The <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Cyrix had indeed reverse engineered the Intel part, but had conceived their own compatible design, the <b>courts</b> also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Texas Instruments, SGS-Thomson and IBM were licensed to produce Intel designs. Eventually {{the case was}} dropped and Intel paid Cyrix $12 million to drop anti-trust charges against them.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, his son, Andreas Wass, {{appealed to}} the Romanian courts to annul the sentence, but the Romanian <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> no new {{evidence}} was presented and as such, the sentence was upheld.|$|R
5|$|Illinois v. Hemi Group, LLC, 622 F.3d 754 (7th Cir. 2010), was a {{personal}} jurisdiction {{case in which the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois' ruling finding personal jurisdiction based on Internet transactions. In the initial filing, the state of Illinois sued Hemi Group LLC (Hemi) for selling cigarettes to Illinois residents over the Internet in violation of state law and for failing to report those sales in violation of federal law. Hemi moved to dismiss the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction, but the district <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the Internet transactions provided a basis for Hemi to be sued in Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In early 1996, the Hunter Mariners {{club was}} officially launched, without a home ground, {{but on that}} same day the Super League was banned from running its rebel competition. Originally the Mariners were allowed to use the Newcastle Knights home ground Marathon Stadium by the Showground Trust, but the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> they had no rights to play there. The club {{eventually}} played at Topper Stadium, sharing {{the ground with the}} National Soccer League's Newcastle Breakers, and used over $1 million to upgrade facilities at the stadium. After an appeal in mid-1996, the Super League was officially allowed to run the competition, which began in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments. The <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her. In that case, the Court had said explicitly that disciplining employees for things they did not actually do did not {{rise to the level}} of a constitutional violation.|$|E
50|$|The Conservative {{government}} {{of the day was}} very hostile to the convention and challenged the local authorities' right to finance the convention, although the <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> they were in fact entitled to do so.|$|R
50|$|The <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Atari had infringed Nintendo's {{copyright}} {{by creating}} verbatim and substantially similar {{copies of the}} protected elements of the 10NES chip. Atari was unsuccessful in claiming that such copying was fair use, or that Nintendo had misused its copyright.|$|R
50|$|In {{a lawsuit}} filed by NML, the lower UK <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Argentina had state immunity. Before 2011, Elliott {{successfully}} appealed the case to the UK Supreme Court, which ruled that Elliott had the right to attempt to seize Argentine property in the United Kingdom.|$|R
5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, the <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts have}} rarely treated {{content-based}} regulation of journalism with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974), the Court unanimously {{struck down a}} state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> freedom, but not responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} §14 of Article IV forbade {{the incorporation}} of churches, though the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision, in its 1969 report, had recognized that the prohibition was probably invalid. The federal district court for the Western District of Virginia ruled in April 2002 that this provision of the Virginia Constitution was in fact unconstitutional, because it violates the federal constitutional right to {{the free exercise of}} religion. The <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it is unconstitutional to deny a church the option to incorporate under state law when other groups can incorporate. An amendment striking the ban on church incorporation was approved by Virginia voters in November 2006.|$|E
50|$|The state <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Virginia law prohibiting lotteries {{could be}} enforced, {{notwithstanding}} {{the act of}} Congress which authorized the D.C. lottery. The Cohens appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that their conduct was protected by the Act of Congress authorizing the D.C. lottery.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that,</b> while [...] "the {{standard}} of care for engineers in the industry" [...] after a failed safety test was to [...] "redesign and retest," [...] and although fixes were inexpensive, [...] "Ford produced and sold the Pinto to the public without doing anything to remedy the defects." ...|$|R

5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat. The <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of the lifeboat. The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E
5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
5|$|At present, it is {{not clear}} what {{evidence}} the President may rely on to be satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide the issue. In the Sarawak case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg, decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, the <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the phrase ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the Members of Parliament was a term of art which had to be signified by a formal vote of no confidence taken by the legislature. In contrast, a Sabah court held in Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote. This might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President.|$|E
500|$|Unlike in Pink and Belmont, an {{executive}} agreement on potato imports from Canada, litigated in United States v. Guy W. Capps, Inc., another oft cited case, the courts declared an agreement unenforceable. [...] In Capps the <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the agreement, which directly contradicted a statute passed by Congress, {{could not be}} enforced.|$|R
50|$|The <b>courts</b> have <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{special-purpose}} districts {{must also}} follow the one person, one vote rule.|$|R
50|$|Curtis McCarty was {{released}} in 2007 after spending nearly 20 years on death row. The <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Gilchrist acted to either alter or intentionally lose evidence. McCarty sued Gilchrist for her wrongdoing, but his case was thrown out on technical terms, like those of most exonerees. He has received no compensation for the injustice he suffered.|$|R
5|$|In November 1960, Lord Stansgate died. Benn {{automatically}} {{became a}} peer, preventing him from {{sitting in the}} House of Commons. The Speaker of the Commons, Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, did not allow him to deliver a speech from the bar of the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called. Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage, Benn fought to retain his seat in a by-election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An election <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner-up, Malcolm St Clair, {{who was at the}} time also the heir presumptive to a peerage.|$|E
5|$|In this situation, {{the court}} had decided in {{previous}} cases that immigration detention, {{for the purposes of}} processing and removal, did not infringe on Chapter III. Al-Kateb argued that if indeed the provisions of the Migration Act extended as far as to allow the indefinite detention of people like him, then it would have gone beyond those valid purposes and would infringe Chapter III. That is, non-judicial detention is permitted for the purposes of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of removal are remote or impracticable for the reasonably foreseeable future, then the detention can no longer be considered to be for the purpose of removal. Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of the Federal Court in another case, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri, in which a Full Court of the Federal <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Green unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to sue the}} New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation for copyright infringement over a similar programme. The clap-o-meter {{was one of the}} distinctive features of the format by which Green sought to define it as copyrightable. The <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a loose format defined by catchphrases and accessories, such as the clap-o-meter, was not copyrightable.|$|R
50|$|Under the Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act of 1992, {{people found}} in {{possession}} of more than 115 grams of dagga were presumed to be guilty of dealing. However, following {{the adoption of the}} interim constitution of South Africa, <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> this unjustifiably infringed the constitutionally enshrined presumption of innocence, and consequently invalidated those parts of the Act.|$|R
