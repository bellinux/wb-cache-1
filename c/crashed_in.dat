30|$|Kim et al. [12] {{investigated}} crashes {{which occurred}} at rural intersections. The {{results showed that}} clear weather increases the probability of angular and sideswipe <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the same direction, and decreases the probability of rear-end and sideswipe <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction. Wet surface conditions increase the probability of sideswipe <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the same direction, while the dry surface conditions increase the probability of angular, rear-end, and sideswipe <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction [12].|$|R
25|$|Two serious crashes, the Harrow and Wealdstone rail <b>crash</b> <b>in</b> 1952 (in which 112 people died), and the Lewisham rail <b>crash</b> <b>in</b> 1957 (in which 90 people died) {{led to the}} {{introduction}} of the Automatic Warning System across the network.|$|R

5|$|On 10 October 1984, GG1001 <b>crashed</b> <b>in</b> South Korea on a {{demonstration}} flight, killing Northrop pilot Darrell Cornell. An investigation cleared the F-20 of mechanical or design faults; it concluded Cornell had blacked out due to excessive g-forces. GI1001 <b>crashed</b> <b>in</b> May 1985 at Goose Bay, Labrador, killing Northrop pilot Dave Barnes. Again the crash was blamed on G-LOC; Barnes had been practicing his aerobatic routine for the Paris Air Show.|$|E

5|$|Altogether, the Luftwaffe lost between 69 and 71 {{aircraft}} {{destroyed or}} {{damaged beyond repair}} {{as a result of}} its operations over Britain on 18 August 1940. Of this total, 59 were lost to certain or probable action by fighters while two fell to ground fire, four to a combination of both and one collided with a British training aircraft. The remaining three <b>crashed</b> <b>in</b> German-held territory owing to technical failures. Altogether, the losses represented seven per cent of the force committed. Around 29 aircraft <b>crashed</b> <b>in</b> England. Personnel losses were 94 German crews killed, 40 captured and 25 returned with wounds. Some 27 to 31 German aircraft returned with damage.|$|E
25|$|His {{most celebrated}} novel {{in this regard}} is <b>Crash,</b> <b>in</b> which cars symbolise the {{mechanisation}} of the world and man's capacity to destroy himself with the technology he creates. The characters (the protagonist, called Ballard, included) become increasingly obsessed with the violent psychosexuality of car <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> general, and celebrity car <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> particular. Ballard's disturbing novel was turned into a controversial—and likewise disturbing—cerebral film by David Cronenberg.|$|R

25|$|The {{crash was}} the deadliest air {{disaster}} {{to occur in}} mainland New Zealand since the July 1963 crash of New Zealand National Airways Corporation Flight 441 in the Kaimai Ranges, and the deadliest crash involving a New Zealand aircraft since the November 1979 crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 into Mount Erebus. , it is the deadliest ever ballooning disaster in New Zealand, and the fourth-deadliest worldwide, surpassed only by the balloon <b>crash</b> <b>in</b> Australia in 1989 that killed 13, the balloon <b>crash</b> <b>in</b> Texas in 2016 that killed 16 people, and the 2013 <b>crash</b> <b>in</b> Egypt that killed 19 people.|$|R

30|$|Model 2 {{indicates}} {{the results of}} the probit model for those drivers who were involved in rear-end and angle <b>crashes,</b> <b>in</b> locations with no traffic control devices. Particularly, model 2 showed that route type is a contributing factor <b>in</b> <b>crash</b> severity model. Drivers who were involved in work zone weather-related <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> rural or secondary routes were 37 % more likely to be involved <b>in</b> severe <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> comparison with drivers who were driving on interstate highways. This could be because most of the rural roads are narrow two-way two-lane undivided roads which do not have enough shoulder width. Even secondary roads {{do not have the same}} quality as interstate roadways, which might intensify the severity of <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> rural and secondary roads.|$|R

40|$|Prior {{literature}} suggests that Daylight Saving Time (DST) can both {{increase the risk of}} automobile <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the short run and decrease the risk of automobile <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the long run. We use 28 years (1976 - 2003) of automobile crash data from the United States, and exploit a natural experiment arising from a 1986 federal law that changed the time when states switched to DST to identify the short run and long run effects of DST on automobile crashes. Our findings suggest that (1) DST has no significant detrimental effect on automobile <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the short run; (2) DST significantly reduces automobile <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the long run with a 8 - 11 % fall <b>in</b> <b>crashes</b> involving pedestrians, and a 6 - 10 % fall <b>in</b> <b>crashes</b> for vehicular occupants in the weeks after the spring shift to DST. ...|$|R
