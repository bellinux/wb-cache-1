25|$|In graph theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, an {{indifference}} graph is an undirected graph constructed by assigning a real number to each vertex and connecting two vertices by an edge when their numbers are within one unit of each other. Indifference graphs are also the intersection graphs of sets of unit intervals, or of properly nested intervals (intervals none of which contains any other one). Based on {{these two types of}} interval representations, these graphs are also <b>called</b> <b>unit</b> interval graphs or proper interval graphs; they form a subclass of the interval graphs.|$|E
25|$|NIMs are {{constructed}} of periodic basic parts <b>called</b> <b>unit</b> cells, {{which are usually}} significantly smaller than the wavelength of the externally applied electromagnetic radiation. The unit cells of the first experimentally investigated NIMs were constructed from circuit board material, or in other words, wires and dielectrics. And in general, these artificially constructed cells are stacked or planar and configured in a particular repeated pattern to compose the individual NIM. For instance, the unit cells of the first NIMs were stacked horizontally and vertically, resulting in a pattern that was repeated and intended (see below images).|$|E

25|$|In December 1987, {{with the}} {{beginning}} of the first intifada, Hamas was founded by Muslim Brotherhood members and was headed by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Mohammad Taha. Hamas sent out feelers, via talks with Simon Peres, in early 1988 offering an acknowledgement of Israel in exchange for a return to the 1967 borders, but soon discarded negotiations in favour of armed resistance, in order to clearly demarcate the difference between its position and that of Palestinian nationalists. Since the leaders of Majd (Hamas's internal security service), Salah Shehade and Yahya Sinwar, were detained in prison, Hamas set up a new structure, <b>called</b> <b>Unit</b> 101, headed by Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, whose function was to kidnap Israeli soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Troughton {{remained}} in the part for three seasons until 1969, eventually tiring of the workload of starring in a regular series. By this time, the viewing figures for Doctor Who had fallen considerably, and new script editor Terrance Dicks recalled {{that there was some}} talk of ending the series at the conclusion of its sixth season in 1969 (though this has been denied by Bryant, Sherwin and director David Maloney, with paperwork suggesting it was actually in danger {{at the end of the}} seventh season in 1970). The series' budget was also increasingly strained by the cost of exotic sets, costumes and props every time the Doctor visited a new setting, and so Bryant and Sherwin (now effectively acting as co-producer, though the BBC refused to credit him as such) came up with the idea of reducing the cost of the series by setting all of the adventures on Earth, with the Doctor to act as the Scientific Advisor to an organisation <b>called</b> <b>UNIT,</b> the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, charged with defending the Earth from alien invasion.|$|E

40|$|The {{tariff policy}} of a {{telecommunication}} operator has a strategic importance on achieving of optimal revenues and a fundamental impact on {{its position in}} the competition with another operators on the liberalised telecommunication market. The payment for a connection through a telecommunication network is determined by a rate for one <b>call</b> <b>unit,</b> by the duration of the <b>call</b> <b>unit</b> and their count during a call. An operator derives the rate and the duration of the <b>call</b> <b>unit</b> from a detailed analysis of large databases that contain statistical data on counts and duration of particular calls depending on the call type. Only the operator knows these data files and it keeps them confidential. It will be shown in the paper how it is possible to come to an estimation of revenues from telecommunication traffic only knowing a pair of basic parameters.
