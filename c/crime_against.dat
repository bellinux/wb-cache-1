The National Crime Records Bureau reported in 1998 that by 2010 growth in the rate of <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> women would exceed the population growth rate. Earlier, many <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> women were not reported to police due to the social stigma attached to rape and molestation.

50|$|The <b>Crimes</b> <b>Against</b> Humanity Initiative {{had three}} primary objectives: (1) {{to study the}} law and sociological reality as regards the {{commission}} of <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> humanity; (2) to combat the indifference and the negative legal consequences emergent from the idea that <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> humanity are less serious than genocide; and (3) to address {{the gap in the}} law by elaborating the first-ever comprehensive specialized convention on <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> humanity.|$|R
5|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{alleges that}} murder as a <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> humanity {{took place in}} Nakuru and Naivasha.

One witness testified that 23 people died in Naivasha from burns including 19 who died in a single arson attack on the Kabati estate. The majority of the killings were the result of attacks with machetes and blunt instruments although guns were used in some attacks.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Athens, {{a person}} who {{committed}} suicide without {{the approval of the}} state was denied the honors of a normal burial. The person would be buried alone, {{on the outskirts of the}} city, without a headstone or marker. However, it was deemed to be an acceptable method to deal with military defeat. In Ancient Rome, while suicide was initially permitted, it was later deemed a <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> the state due to its economic costs. Aristotle condemned all forms of suicide while Plato was ambivalent. In Rome some reasons for suicide include volunteering death in a gladiator combat, guilt over murdering someone, to save the life of another, as a result of mourning, from shame from being raped, as an escape from intolerable situations like physical suffering, military defeat, or criminal pursuit.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{introduced}} a resolution stating that North Korea's invasion was {{a breach of}} peace in violation of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.

The Yugoslavian delegate requested that a North Korean diplomat be present as well, but this request was not granted. North Korea was {{not a member of}} the UN and had no representation in the organization. Myon read a prepared statement calling the invasion a <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> humanity, and said that as the UN had played a major role in the founding of South Korea, it was their responsibility to help defend it from aggression. The UNSC debated the resolution and made amendments and revisions to its wording before passing it.|$|E
50|$|Legal classification. The {{three main}} {{categories}} of crime under the Japanese Criminal Law are <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> the state, <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> society and <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> individuals. This {{law was passed}} under the old Constitution which had mainly focused {{on the power of}} the emperor and the state. As a result, <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> the imperial family and the state were highly emphasized. While <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> the imperial family were abolished after World War II, the fundamental structure of this law was little changed. Since there has been no complete revision of the law, the law remains fairly antiquated on the surface.|$|R
50|$|SRS {{has only}} two <b>crime</b> categories: <b>Crimes</b> <b>Against</b> Persons (e.g., murder, rape, assault, robbery) and <b>Crimes</b> <b>Against</b> Property (e.g., car theft, burglary, larceny, arson).

2500|$|<b>Crimes</b> <b>against</b> {{humanity}} {{are certain}} acts that are deliberately [...] committed {{as part of}} a widespread or systematic attack or individual attack directed against any civilian or an identifiable part of a civilian population. The first prosecution for <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> humanity took place at the Nuremberg trials. <b>Crimes</b> <b>against</b> humanity have since been prosecuted by other international courts – such as the International Court of Justice [...] and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Court, as well as in domestic prosecutions. The law of <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> humanity has primarily developed through the evolution of customary international law. <b>Crimes</b> <b>against</b> humanity are not codified in an international convention, although there is currently an international effort to establish such a treaty, led by the <b>Crimes</b> <b>Against</b> Humanity Initiative.|$|R
5|$|The {{charge of}} murder as a <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> {{humanity}} {{was made by}} the prosecutor in relation to multiple attacks {{that took place in the}} aftermath of the election. The prosecution alleges that members of the network attacked Turbo town on 30 and 31 December 2007, resulting in at least 4 deaths and with one witness claiming that he saw more than 200 dead bodies. Additionally the prosecutor alleges that network members attacked the Huruma, Kiambaa, Kimumu, Langas and Yamumbi areas of Eldoret, resulting in 70 to 87 deaths. It is alleged that during the attack in Kaimbaa several people took refuge in a church which was locked from outside and then burned down causing between 17 and 35 people to be burned to death. Additionally the prosecutor alleges that the towns of Kapsabet and Nandi Hills town were attacked by network members.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day {{a large number}} of people staged protests near Jantar Mantar, New Delhi. There were minor clashes between some groups of protesters and the police; the police then removed some protesters from the area. One group of protesters also observed a one-day hunger strike at Jantar Mantar. All roads leading to India Gate were closed by police and areas where protesters had gathered during the previous week were out of bounds to the public. Some of the protesters drew graffiti and slogans on papers spread on the road, condemning the incident and demanding stricter laws and speedy judgement. The BJP renewed its demand for a special parliament session to discuss the case and to adopt stricter laws on <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> women.|$|E
5|$|A {{father and}} {{daughter}} rollerblading in Central Park stumble across {{the body of a}} woman with several lacerations hidden in a bush. Munch (Richard Belzer) and Fin (Ice-T) learn Peter Harrison (Nick Stahl), who was performing community service for a prior <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> a woman, left work early with a cut thumb {{around the time of the}} murder. Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Benson (Mariska Hargitay) question Harrison, who spouts wild conspiracy theories about the police. During an interrogation, Harrison suggests he killed the woman in Central Park for taking photos of him before his attorney, Julia Zimmer (Kelly Bishop), stops the questioning. Munch and Fin find a bloody knife during a search of Harrison's apartment and forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran (Mike Doyle) confirms the DNA matches the victim, resulting in an open-and-shut case against Harrison. However, Zimmer finds a technical error by forensics technician Dale Stuckey (Noel Fisher) in the evidence paperwork. Though Stuckey insists he made no mistake, Judge Elizabeth Donnelly (Judith Light) is forced to set Harrison free, and makes a harsh rebuke against Stuckey.|$|E

5|$|According to Australian court documents, on 10 January 2006, the Šibenik County Court {{ordered that}} a warrant be issued for Vasiljković's arrest. The {{offences}} listed were two alleged war crimes against prisoners of war, and one alleged war <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> the civilian population. The latter {{are related to}} {{his role in the}} attack on Glina which caused civilian deaths and injuries. He was arrested in Australia in 2006, but as an Australian national, he appealed against extradition to Croatia claiming that he would not get a fair trial there. The appeal was granted by the Federal Court in 2009, and Vasiljković was released. However, the High Court of Australia overturned the decision and Vasiljković was arrested after a 43-day search for him by the police. Subsequently, Vasiljković appealed against his extradition citing other grounds. His extradition was approved by the Minister for Home Affairs Jason Clare in November 2012, however Vasiljković appealed that decision as well. In December 2014, the Federal Court upheld Clare's decision.|$|E
5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E
5|$|In December 1283 in Gniezno, {{at the age}} of 22 or 23 years, Ludgarda, wife of Przemysł II, died unexpectedly. Relations {{between the}} spouses for some time before her death weren't very good; perhaps there had even been a {{separation}} between them. The reason for this was the supposed infertility of Ludgarda, more apparent after ten years of marriage. The actual period of marital intercourse between the spouses given their age (both are quite young {{at the time of their}} wedding) could actually be shorter. Indeed, there is no direct proof about Ludgarda's barrenness beyond the lack of offspring; in those, the childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be the woman's fault, although in this case (due to the birth of a daughter from Przemysł II's second marriage), it seems more likely. It wasn't a surprise when accusations began to emerge against the Duke of Greater Poland of the suspected murder of his wife. It must be noted, however, that no contemporary source mentions this, a fact more surprising because Przemysł II had bitter enemies who certainly would use this <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> him. Also any reactions from church or public penance would noticed.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with distinguishing between persons convicted of <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> persons and those convicted of <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> property using the hostility factor as a criterion for comparison. There is some indication that the <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> persons group {{is more likely to}} express overt hostility than the <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> property group. This would be a useful distinction since the ability to recognize and separate violent or potentially violent persons from the nonviolent is desirable in order to help provide a healthier society...|$|R
