5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Henning Brauer {{presented}} OpenNTPD, an NTP implementation with a {{focus on}} security and encompassing a privilege separated design. Whilst it is aimed more <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> simpler generic needs of OpenBSD users, it also includes some protocol security improvements whilst still being compatible with existing NTP servers. It was originally designed for OpenBSD but has a portable version available and that has been made available as a package in Linux package repositories.|$|E
25|$|Jesus {{carrying}} the cross. Looking <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> six soldiers, the one {{near the bottom}} of the cross where it is dragging on the ground holds a shield and sword. Then the man with his leg straddling the cross and seeming to add to Christ' difficulty in lifting the cross, has a piece of rope in his right hand and in his left hand what appears to be a form of maraca to add to the rhythm of the music being played. The sixth soldier also appears to be pushing the cross down to add to the weight.|$|E
25|$|On August 18, the Wednesday {{after he}} {{returned}} to the Santa Rosa Beach house, he went up to Vortex Spring again. In the middle of the day, he did one dive. Other divers saw him looking <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> area around the cave entrance, as if, it was later reported, he was planning something. After resurfacing he filled his tanks at the dive shop, a transaction recorded on security cameras (it is not known what he filled those tanks with). He spent {{much of the rest of}} the afternoon by himself alongside the spring, witnesses said, testing equipment and making notes in his dive log.|$|E

25|$|As an {{alternative}} to trousers, breeches (or knickers in variations of English where this does not refer to underwear) may be worn with informal suits, such as tweed. These are shorter, descending to just below the knees, fastened <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the calf by a tab or button cuff. While once common, they are now typically only worn when engaged in traditional outdoor sports, such as shooting or golf. The length and design {{is closely related to}} the plus-fours (and plus-sixes etc.) worn for sport, but differ in having no bagginess. They are usually designed to be worn with long socks meeting just below the knee, but riding breeches, worn with long boots such as top boots, are long enough to meet the boot and display no sock.|$|E
25|$|Orwell married Eileen O'Shaughnessy on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards, the {{political}} crisis began in Spain and Orwell followed developments there <b>closely.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} year, concerned by Francisco Franco's military uprising, (supported by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and local groups such as Falange), Orwell {{decided to go to}} Spain {{to take part in the}} Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. Under the erroneous impression that he needed papers from some left-wing organisation to cross the frontier, on John Strachey's recommendation he applied unsuccessfully to Harry Pollitt, leader of the British Communist Party. Pollitt was suspicious of Orwell's political reliability; he asked him whether he would undertake to join the International Brigade and advised him to get a safe-conduct from the Spanish Embassy in Paris. Not wishing to commit himself until he had seen the situation in situ, Orwell instead used his Independent Labour Party contacts to get a letter of introduction to John McNair in Barcelona.|$|E

Twelve members of the Academy were present. Spirits were high. Champagne was had.

500|$|Virginians were {{reluctant}} to believe that greatly respected figures such as Washington and Franklin would be complicit in setting up a tyrannical system. [...] There were broad attacks on Mason; the New Haven Gazette suggested {{that he had not}} done much for his country during the war, in marked contrast to Washington. Oliver Ellsworth blamed the Virginia opposition on the Lee family, who had long had tensions with the Washington family, and on [...] "the madness of Mason". Tarter, in his American National Biography article on Mason, wrote that [...] "the rigidity of [...] views and his increasingly belligerent personality produced an intolerance and intemperance in his behavior that surprised and angered Madison, with whom he had worked <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the convention, and Washington, who privately condemned Mason's actions during the ratification struggle." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I sneaked {{up there}} a few times. And under the bright, unforgiving lights of television, I was able to {{encounter}} the real Michelangelo. I {{was so close to}} him I could see the bristles from his brushes caught in the paint; and the mucky thumbprints he'd left along his margins. The first thing that impressed me was his speed. Michelangelo worked at Schumacher pace. Adam's famous little penis was captured with a single brushstroke: a flick of the wrist, and the first man had his manhood. I also enjoyed his sense of humour, which, from close up, turned out to be refreshingly puerile. If you look <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> angels who attend the scary prophetess on the Sistine ceiling known as the Cumaean Sibyl, you will see that one of them has stuck his thumb between his fingers in that mysteriously obscene gesture that visiting fans are still treated to today at Italian football matches." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the {{developer}} blog, the localization process for Izuna 2 was [...] "surprisingly uncomplicated" [...] {{and the original}} run through took less than a month. Success, the Japanese developer, provided Atlus, the North American developers, with well-organized files, which helped make the translation and editing quick and easy. However, the quality assurance and debugging process was a [...] "nightmare" [...] {{due to the nature}} of the game and the randomized spawning of creatures. Additionally, the team looked <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bugs found by Japanese players and attempted to replicate every reported bug. This effort was marred by the lack of a debug menu, though debuggers were able to use both a one-hit kill option and a floor-skipping option. Unfortunately, the one-hit kill option did not apply to the bosses, so debuggers still had to grind to gain enough levels to defeat the bosses. In total, six official testers found 104 system-type bugs and 259 text bugs.|$|E

500|$|At 12:05, Duncan {{raised the}} signal {{ordering}} his ships {{to engage the}} enemy <b>closely.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the Dutch ship Jupiter, under Rear-Admiral Hermanus Reijntjes, fourth from {{the southern end of}} the line, opened fire on the rapidly approaching Monarch. The Dutch ships had waited until the British were well within effective range in order to maximise the effect of their shot, and soon Onslow's flagship was under fire from the entire rearguard of the Dutch line, the ship suffering damage while attempting to break through the Dutch line between Jupiter and Haarlem at 12:30. On Monarch, Captain Edward O'Bryen remarked to Onslow that he could not see where his ship could pass between the closely formed Dutch ships, to which the Admiral responded that [...] "the Monarch will make a passage." [...] Striking the small gap between the ships, Onslow fired raking broadsides into both vessels and then turned to lay his ship alongside Reyntjes' flagship. As he did, the Dutch frigate Monnikkendam and the brig Daphné pulled out of the second line and attempted to fill the gap Monarch had created, firing into the British ship of the line as they did so. In response, Onslow opened fire on the smaller vessels, destroying the frigate's wheel and damaging the rigging, so that the ship fell back, followed later by the severely damaged brig.|$|E
