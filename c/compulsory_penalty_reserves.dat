40|$|Rewards and {{penalties}} are common practical tools {{that can be}} used to promote cooperation in social institutions. The evolution of cooperation under reward and punishment incentives in joint enterprises has been formalized and investigated, mostly by using compulsory public good games. Recently, Sasaki et al. (2012, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109 : 1165 - 1169) considered optional participation as well as institutional incentives and described how the interplay between these mechanisms affects the evolution of cooperation in public good games. Here, we present a full classification of these cases of evolutionary dynamics. Specifically, whenever penalties are large enough to cause the bi-stability of both cooperation and defection in cases in which participation in the public good game is <b>compulsory,</b> these <b>penalties</b> will ultimately result in cooperation if participation in the public good game is optional. The global stability of coercion-based cooperation in this optional case contrasts strikingly with the bi-stability that is observed in the compulsory case We also argue that optional participation is not as effective under rewards as under punishment...|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. (Radiography) Knowledge {{and skills}} {{are related to}} time and become {{obsolete}} if no effort is made to update them on an ongoing basis. Continuous Professional Development (CPD) is, therefore, the effort of committed professional practitioners to maintain and broaden {{the knowledge and skills}} related to their profession, following completion of formal training. The legal obligation of healthcare professional practitioners is to provide a high standard of care and act {{in the best interest of}} patients. To achieve this, radiographers must maintain and strive to improve their professional knowledge and competence. The main aim of this study was thus to assess the diagnostic radiographers‟ CPD participation in Kenya. The study was empirical in nature and therefore relied heavily on perceptions, experiences and observations. Mail questionnaires were sent to 250 radiographers working in Kenya during the time of the study. Self- addressed and stamped envelopes accompanied the questionnaires for ease of reply. Data analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 14. 0 and the results were presented in frequency and percentage tables. Cross tabulations were employed to demonstrate and test relationships between variables. Results revealed that a large number (69 %) of diagnostic radiographers in Kenya are not participating in CPD due to various barriers. The study, therefore, recommended that CPD for radiographers should be declared <b>compulsory</b> and <b>penalties</b> are introduced for non-adherence to CPD requirements. This could encourage radiographers to keep up to date with modern techniques. The SORK should provide a legal framework for CPD and legitimize the organization and implementation of CPD structures [...] ...|$|R
