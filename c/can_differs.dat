Different production system will have different optimal working conditions and hence should be compared with parameters suitable for the actual production system. When planning production and calculating production costs the batch size is of high interest. Based on a manufacturing part cost model, this paper will present a new model, close connected to the production system, integrating production performance, set-up times, material costs, material handling costs and tied capital, giving the production economic optimal batch size. The aim is to give companies a model for determining the economic optimal batch size in order to use this knowledge to make strategic decisions regarding production planning. Mathematical simulations are performed to analyse the differences in result from the developed model and Wilsons existing standard method for calculating the economic order quantity, hence to verify the importance of making an in-depth analysis, taking the production system into consideration. The advantage of the developed model is the usage of production costs based on variable batch sizes, giving a more accurate outcome...|$|E

Identifying where nanomaterials are present in construction materials is challenging. Academic literature reports what nanotechnology can offer construction, but this <b>can</b> <b>differs</b> from {{the reality of what}} is currently in use. Furthermore, it is difficult to source accurate information regarding nano-enabled products on the market; under current legislation, the declaration of nano content is voluntary and there is no requirement to provide details within safety data sheets. Although publically available information remains opaque and incomplete, several studies and reports have attempted to clarify this situation. This research builds upon this information, presenting an overview of nano-enabled products currently available for use in construction. This is based upon literature, manufacturers’ published information and on discussions with suppliers and end users. Concrete, glass and coatings are the most widely available nano-enabled products, together with insulation and special steels. The precise nanomaterial used in each case however, and the form and quantity involved, can be difficult to identify. This makes assessing the risks difficult, which is problematic as some nanomaterials are considered to be hazardous. More detailed information regarding commercially available products will be important if risks are to be managed, enabling the industry {{to take full advantage of}} the benefits of nanotechnology...|$|E

In trials conducted in the temperate maritime climate of Ireland {{on a range of}} acidic soils, calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and urea gave comparable yield performance. There was little evidence of reduced yields by using urea for grassland or spring barley. Our finding that urea produced annual yields that were not significantly different from <b>CAN</b> <b>differs</b> from previous studies which found that yields from urea were lower than those from ammonium nitrate or nitrate based fertiliser in the UK. However, there are also published results from trials conducted in temperate Irish grassland showing equal yield performance of CAN and urea in the 1970 s. Based on yield performance and the cost of fertiliser there is scope to dramatically increase the level of urea usage in straight and blended fertilisers in the temperate maritime climate of Ireland in both grassland and spring barley. Such an increase will bring substantial benefits in terms of reducing direct nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from fertiliser applied to soil, particularly in poorly draining soils subject to high levels of precipitation. Nitrogen recovery by plants tends to be more sensitive to differences in fertiliser efficiency than is yield. Although yields did not differ between urea and CAN; urea had a lower nitrogen recovery indicating that urea usage will also result in a reduced level of fertiliser use efficiency. Reduced efficiency is less tangible to farmers who tend to be primarily concerned with dependable yield results. Reduced efficiency is a problem nonetheless, particularly as it is closely linked to NH 3 emissions in urea usage. European countries including Ireland have committed to reduce national NH 3 emissions to comply with the revised National Emission Ceilings Directive (2001 / 81 /EC) in Europe. Increased urea usage, which looks attractive from a yield, cost and direct N 2 O perspective in Ireland, runs counter to meeting these commitments. Additionally, NH 3 is a source of indirect N 2 O emissions that will negate some of the N 2 O savings from urea. Due to the issues of yield dependability, fertiliser efficiency, N 2 O and NH 3 emissions the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) is a particularly attractive option for making urea use more efficient by addressing its key weakness in the area of variable NH 3 loss and efficiency. The urease inhibitor NBPT along with the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) were tested with urea in comparison with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN). The nitrification inhibitor DCD was very effective in reducing fertiliser N associated N 2 O emissions. Indeed, its usage allowed N 2 O levels to be reduced to levels comparable to where no application of N fertiliser was made at some site-years. However, at the DCD incorporation rate tested, DCD contributed to variability in NH 3 loss from urea and suppressed both yield response and fertiliser efficiency. Use of the urease inhibitor NBPT in addition to DCD went a substantial way to resolving these shortcomings. Continuing work is needed to tailor the rate of existing and new urease and nitrification inhibitors to optimise the balance between suppression of gaseous N emissions, agronomic performance and economic considerations...|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{and interpretation of}} the flow behaviour of complex liquids is a fascinating field of research. When designing materials with tailored properties, complex fluids and polymeric liquids can display unique combinations of properties that will be controlled by the structure (the ‘morphology’ and internal conformation) of the material and {{that would not be}} attainable with a simple single phase. Key to predicting and tailoring the properties of these fluids is the understanding of the fundamental relations that govern the effect of flow on the structural features over a wide range of length and time scales. This understanding provides the basis for the production and invention of new materials and applications, ranging from simple day to day products as shampoo or spread cheese to high end pharmaceutical or medical products as stabilized colloidal antibiotic solutions. The importance of the understanding on the flow behaviour of structured fluids reflects also in recent changes in chemical industries, whose focus has shifted over the last years from bulk chemical and commodity products towards speciality chemicals and higher value-added materials. Following the definition of Cussler and Moggridge [1] these are in particular chemical products and formulations “whose microstructure, rather than molecular structure, creates value”. Flow related phenomena as droplet deformation, breakup, or coalescences, changes in crystal size or distribution as well as the structure alignment, association and conformation change of polymers will cause, as laid out by M. Hill, “changes in microstructure due to processing (that) are … unavoidable” [2], and require hence the fundamental understanding on how the flow of a complex or polymeric liquid is related to the its microstructural evolution and how this microstructure influences the flow and processing conditions. In the science and technology of complex 'structured fluids' one has to deal with the omnipresence of ‘confinements’ for the separate single phases, for example interfaces and surfaces in emulsions, immiscible polymer blends, foams and suspensions of particles. However, in many cases it is the influence of external surfaces (walls or free surfaces) that plays a dominant role on the evolution of the internal structure during flow. These effects are not necessarily limited to multiphase materials, but are equally important for structure and orientation of dissolved macromolecules or colloidal dispersed aggregated structures. Some examples include the recent trends towards miniaturized processing, the advent of microfluidic techniques, the orientation of particles by flow near walls with unexpected macroscopic consequences, the importance of free surface flows in technological processes such as ink-jet printing and even more “forward looking” techniques such as convective nanoparticle self-assembly. When the length scale of the flow is reduced in at least one dimension, it can become comparable to the characteristic length scale of the internal structure of a fluid. The scaling rules and concepts that hold for bulk materials will then no longer be valid. There will be an interplay between the internal structure of the material and the external surfaces, thus potentially affecting the morphology development of multiphase materials or the orientation and conformation of polymers in solutions. But most important, the coupling between the presence of walls and interfacial phenomena can make it possible to generate structures that may not be attainable with bulk processing. Recent investigations have indicated that, for example, droplet break-up of polymer blends changes dramatically when the dimension of the flow geometry becomes comparable to the droplet size, or that tribological properties (friction 6 in confinement) of polymeric fluids <b>can</b> <b>differs</b> dramatically from the bulk properties, even for hydrodynamic lubrication, once the dimensions of the polymer coils are reached. However, a comprehensive investigation of the effects of confinements on the flow properties of complex liquids is still missing to date. On the other hand, free surfaces during the formation and break-up of liquid filaments, as present in atomization, extrusion or jetting operations, replace the ‘hard’ and inflexible confinement of processing equipment with the soft but flexible confinement of the strong interfacial tension of a liquid-air surface. Also the free surface of a thinning filament can quickly reach the length scale of the enclosed high-interface fluid, however, much more important is the possibility to induce strong elongational fields, enabling the creation of highly elongated and aligned internal structures that cannot be achieved with rigid surfaces. Understanding the behavior of free-surface flows is of enormous importance {{for a wide variety of}} applications in the chemical processing, food and consumer products industries. Operations such as ink jet printing, spraying of fertilizers, paint-leveling, misting, bottle filling and roll coating are all controlled by interactions between the non-Newtonian stresses arising from the microstructure of the bulk, and capillary stresses at the deformable free surface. The theory for the free surface flow and break-up of a Newtonian liquid is laid out and experimentally verified and a number of recent studies have therefore promulgated the idea of using the capillarity induced thinning of a liquid filament as a rheometric device for quantifying the properties of complex fluids in predominantly extensional flows. Entov and Hinch provide a detailed discussion of the evolution of a perfectly cylindrical thread of a viscoelastic fluid undergoing capillary-driven thinning and breakup, and capillary-thinning devices for the investigation of viscoelastic effects of polymeric solutions have been developed recently by a number of laboratories. However, the boundaries of this technique for the investigation of polymeric solution and melts, as well as the investigation of the response of more complex fluid structures to the strong elongational flow field during a capillary breakup are still unknown. edition: 1 stnrpages: 334 status: publishe...|$|E
