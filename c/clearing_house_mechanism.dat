When settlement process done by one transmitter bank (process A), the probability of increase Net Worth (NW) is p. When settlement process done by more than one transmitter bank (process B), we have introduced the probabilities of a self-transition in each state, that is, if the capital is a multiple of three we have a probability r 1 of remaining in the same state, whereas if the capital is not a multiple of three then the probability is r 2.

40|$|In a {{commodity}} futures trading system, the <b>clearing</b> <b>house</b> {{is of great}} importance. This paper describes and analyses in detail its essence functions and numerous activities. The main goal and a major task of such activities is to preserve financial integrity and stability of the market place. <b>Clearing</b> <b>houses</b> accomplish this task {{by means of a}} financial safeguard system of the futures markets. In order to preserve financial integrity and stability of the commodity futures markets, the <b>clearing</b> <b>house</b> uses three <b>mechanisms.</b> First, the membership in a clearing corporation requires a certain business and professional profile of a firm or an individual member accompanied by a minimal amount of capital determined by special regulations of a clearing corporation and the stock exchange. Second, the <b>clearing</b> <b>house</b> provides a financial safeguard through self-insurance schemes: funded and unfounded ones. Third, the <b>clearing</b> <b>house</b> uses a developed system and mechanism of margins through which it most efficiently exerts permanent control and sustains financial stability of the trading system as a whole. The third system of preserving financial integrity and stability of commodity futures markets is undoubtedly of the greatest importance, as it simultaneously embodies the true nature and essence of commodity futures markets. The development of margin system in commodity futures market has been a long process through which the <b>clearing</b> <b>house</b> has become a general partner and a guarantee of all stock exchange transactions. As a general partner the <b>clearing</b> <b>house</b> embodies the total amount of capital on the stock exchange. In this way, the system of margins appears to be acting not only as an element of the commodity market financial safeguard, but also to have a completely new function, that of imposing capital as a homeostatic subject which maintains its total capital value. The preservation of the total capital value flowing into the commodity futures market is the first and the basic function of the system of margins. However, it has an additional function: to guarantee historical cost of the goods, thereby maintaining the value of individual capitals, the function which is accomplished through various hedging strategies of individual capital...|$|R

40|$|This {{working paper}} reports the {{preliminary}} {{results of an}} effort to analyse under what conditions liquidity can be created in an historic context setting. Starting point is the notion made by Dang, Gorton, and Holmstrom (2012) that symmetric ignorance can create liquidity in money markets under certain circumstances. The authors take as an example the New York clearing house (NYCH) system from 1853 onwards. At times of panic, the intended suppression of bank-specific information by the NYCH avoided the identification of weak banks and thus safeguarded the reputation of all member banks. In addition to the threat of expulsion, one particular successful mechanism that united the banks in the U. S. was the issuance of the clearinghouse loan certificate, a de-facto liability of the clearinghouse. My hypothesis is that a number of critical factors have to be present for the <b>clearing</b> <b>house</b> <b>mechanism</b> to create liquidity. For comparison, I take the example of Switzerland where a clearing house was established in 1876.

Agents trade a risky asset in exchange for cash. Beside the amount of cash and of asset owned the the trader, each agent {{is characterized by a}} sentiment. Moreover, agents share their sentiments by means of interactions that are identified by the graph. Interactions are unidirectional and are supplied with different weights, depending on the class of the source agent. Agent’s trading decision is based on sentiment and, consequently, the stock price process depends on the propagation of information among the interacting agents, on budget constraints, and on market feedbacks. A central market maker (<b>clearing</b> <b>house</b> <b>mechanism)</b> determines the price process at the intersection of the demand and the supply curves. Both closed- and open-market conditions are considered. Results point out validity of the proposed model of information exchange among agents and yield helpful understanding of the role of information in real markets. Under closed market condition, the interaction among agents’ sentiments yields a price process that reproduces main stylized facts of real markets, i. e., fat tails of returns distributions and clustering of volatility. Within open-market conditions, i. e., with an external cash inflow that results in asset price inflation, also the unitary root stylised fact is reproduced by the artificial stock market.

40|$|Stronger {{manifestation of}} climate change impact on global water cycle, water resources, and aquatic {{ecosystems}} has given a strong impetus {{to the development of}} adaptation measures in water management. The present report gives an insight to potential and planned water related measures tackling climate change causes and consequences, which have been included in the Member States River Basin Management Plans, published in various reports and scientific literature mostly within the last decade. The database of about 450 measures analysed in this report and given in a separate Annex as an Excel spreadsheet, constitutes {{the most important part of}} this deliverable. In the context of this report, measures are defined as practical steps or actions taken to (i) reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases, (ii) to decrease the vulnerability of water resources and aquatic ecosystems to climate change, or (iii) enhance the knowledge base on climate-water relationships and increase the societal capacity to take right decisions on this matter. By strategic approach, the measures belong either to planned adaptation, which specifically focuses on climate change and variability, and autonomous adaptation, which goals are not specifically climate related, but have an added value in improving resilience to climate change. Separate chapters are dedicated to each of the five specific adaptation strategies addressed in the REFRESH Project.

Most countries included a chapter to the 1 st RBMP do describe the observed CC and its impacts to water resources management and carried out the ¿climate checking¿ of their programs of measures but the results were reported with a very different level of detail. The distinction of specific CC measures from the complex of measures dealing with floods, droughts and water quality protection, was rather arbitrary. In the Annex of present report the measures are categorized according to the original reports and, hence, some measures which are qualified as CC measures by one country may be not mentioned by other countries which did not consider the linkage to CC strong enough. Some of the measures in the Annex were not directly listed as measures in the management plans, but were picked out from the text discussing the tackling of climate impact. In present analysis, special attention was paid to adaptation measures addressing climate impact on ecosystems. This topic was rather scarcely presented in nine of the 18 RBMPs analysed. As the measures are translated from different languages, the wording does not pretend the full authenticity of the original text and for more detail it is suggested to consult the original plans in national languages.

40|$|Coastal {{birds are}} an {{integral}} part of coastal ecosystems, which nowadays are subject to severe environmental pressures. Effective measures for the management and conservation of seabirds and their habitats call for insight into their population processes and the factors affecting their distribution and abundance. Central to national and international management and conservation measures is the availability of accurate data and information on bird populations, as well as on environmental trends and on measures taken to solve environmental problems. In this thesis I address different aspects of the occurrence, abundance, population trends and breeding success of waterbirds breeding on the Finnish coast of the Baltic Sea, and discuss the implications of the results for seabird monitoring, management and conservation. In addition, I assess the position and prospects of coastal bird monitoring data, in the processing and dissemination of biodiversity data and information in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and other national and international commitments. I show that important factors for seabird habitat selection are island area and elevation, water depth, shore openness, and the composition of island cover habitats. Habitat preferences are species-specific, with certain similarities within species groups. The occurrence of the colonial Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea) is partly affected by different habitat characteristics than its abundance. Using long-term bird monitoring data, I show that eutrophication and winter severity have reduced the populations of several Finnish seabird species. A major demographic factor through which environmental changes influence bird populations is breeding success. Breeding success can function as a more rapid indicator of sublethal environmental impacts than population trends, particularly for long-lived and slowbreeding species, and should therefore be included in coastal bird monitoring schemes. Among my target species, local breeding success can be shown to affect the populations of the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), the Eider (Somateria mollissima) and the Goosander (Mergus merganser) after a time lag corresponding to their species-specific recruitment age. For some of the target species, the number of individuals in late summer can be used as an easier and more cost-effective indicator of breeding success than brood counts. My results highlight that the interpretation and application of habitat and population studies require solid background knowledge of the ecology of the target species. In addition, the special characteristics of coastal birds, their habitats, and coastal bird monitoring data have to be considered in the assessment of their distribution and population trends. According to the results, the relationships between the occurrence, abundance and population trends of coastal birds and environmental factors can be quantitatively assessed using multivariate modelling and model selection. Spatial data sets widely available in Finland can be utilised in the calculation of several variables that are relevant to the habitat selection of Finnish coastal species. Concerning some habitat characteristics field work is still required, due to a lack of remotely sensed data or the low resolution of readily available data in relation to the fine scale of the habitat patches in the archipelago. While long-term data sets exist for water quality and weather, the lack of data concerning for instance the food resources of birds hampers more detailed studies of environmental effects on bird populations. Intensive studies of coastal bird species in different archipelago areas should be encouraged. The provision and free delivery of high-quality coastal data concerning bird populations and their habitats would greatly increase the capability of ecological modelling, as well as the management and conservation of coastal environments and communities. International initiatives that promote open spatial data infrastructures and sharing are therefore highly regarded. To function effectively, international information networks, such as the biodiversity <b>Clearing</b> <b>House</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (CHM) under the CBD, need to be rooted at regional and local levels. Attention should also be paid to the processing of data for higher levels of the information hierarchy, so that data are synthesized and developed into high-quality knowledge applicable to management and conservation...|$|E
