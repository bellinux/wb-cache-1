40|$|To reduce market {{volatility}} observed {{at the close}} of trading and to enhance the fairness of the closing price, the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) changed the way it executed its closing transactions by instituting a five-minute <b>closing</b> <b>call</b> auction. This paper examines the effectiveness of this new mechanism for the TSE. The empirical results show that the <b>closing</b> <b>call</b> has effectively reduced {{market volatility}} at closing and enhanced market efficiency by reducing noise in stock closing prices. However, market liquidity has declined, primarily due to the actions of individual investors. Because the limit order book is fully opaque for the five-minute call period, investors may close their position earlier than the closing period to avoid additional risk. This implies that, to maximize the benefits of the <b>closing</b> <b>call,</b> the TSE should provide the transparency of the limit order book for the <b>closing</b> <b>call</b> period. call auction, market microstructure, market quality.,...|$|R

5|$|On 6 March, Tirpitz, {{escorted by}} three destroyers, {{launched}} {{a raid on}} the British convoys to the Soviet Union. The Germans attempted to intercept convoys PQ-12 and QP-8, but the inclement weather prevented them from finding the convoys. The British located Tirpitz, and the aircraft carrier Victorious launched a strike of twelve Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers. The aircraft were repulsed without having scored any hits on the German ships. Tirpitz and the destroyers were back in port by 12 March. The <b>close</b> <b>call</b> prompted Hitler to mandate that Tirpitz was not to attack another convoy unless its escorting aircraft carrier had been sunk or disabled.|$|E

5|$|Sunderland's {{absence from}} the top flight lasted six years. The club came within one game of {{promotion}} back to the First Division in the 1962–63 season. Sunderland required only a draw in their final game against promotion rivals Chelsea, who had another game left to play after this match, to secure promotion. However, they were defeated, and Chelsea won their last game 7–0 to clinch promotion, finishing ahead of Sunderland on goal average. After the <b>close</b> <b>call</b> in the previous season, the club was promoted to Division One in 1964 after finishing in second place. Sunderland beat Charlton Athletic {{in the final stages}} of the season, where they clinched promotion with a game to spare. At the end of the decade, they were again relegated to the Second Division after finishing 21st.|$|E
5|$|The Australian coaches rested O'Brien for the heats of the 4 × 100 m medley relay; Peter Tonkin swam the breaststroke leg instead. It {{turned out}} to be a <b>close</b> <b>call</b> for the Australians, as they {{finished}} fourth in their heat and qualified seventh fastest, only 1.2s from elimination. In the final, O'Brien was brought into the team to combine with Peter Reynolds, Berry and Dickson. At the end of Reynolds' backstroke leg, Australia were sixth, 3.4s behind the American leaders. O'Brien dived in and completed his leg in 1min 7.8s, a breaststroke split bettered by only Henninger and Prokopenko. This pulled Australia up to fourth position, 1.7s in arrears of the Americans at the halfway mark. Australia progressed further to finish third behind the United States and Germany in a time of 4min 2.3s, missing the silver by 0.7s.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} {{implications}} of using proxies of medically attended injuries (minor injuries and <b>close</b> <b>calls)</b> for understanding concurrent relations among—and behavioral antecedents of—pediatric injuries. Methods Participants were 812 children from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that animal vocalizations can encode information regarding a sender's identity, sex, age, body size, social rank and group membership. However, the association between physiological parameters, particularly stress hormone levels, and vocal behavior is still not well understood. The cooperatively breeding African meerkats (Suricata suricatta) live in family groups with despotic social hierarchies. During foraging, individuals emit <b>close</b> <b>calls</b> that help maintain group cohesion. These contact calls are acoustically distinctive and variable in rate across individuals, yet, information on which factors influence <b>close</b> <b>calling</b> behavior is missing. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify proximate factors that influence variation in call rate and acoustic structure of meerkat <b>close</b> <b>calls.</b> Specifically, we investigated whether <b>close</b> <b>calling</b> behavior is associated with sex, age and rank, or stress hormone output (i. e., measured as fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations) as individual traits of the caller, as well as with environmental conditions (weather) and reproductive seasonality. To disentangle the effects of these factors on vocal behavior, we analyzed sound recordings and assessed fGCM concentrations in 64 wild but habituated meerkats from 9 groups during the reproductive and non-reproductive seasons. Dominant females and one-year old males called at significantly higher rates compared to other social categories during the reproductive season. Additionally, dominant females produced <b>close</b> <b>calls</b> with the lowest mean fundamental frequencies (F 0) and the longest mean pulse durations. Windy conditions were associated with significantly higher call rates during the non-reproductive season. Fecal GCM concentrations were unrelated to <b>close</b> <b>calling</b> behavior. Our findings suggest that meerkat <b>close</b> <b>calling</b> behavior conveys information regarding the sex and social category of the caller, but shows no association with fGCM concentrations. The change in call rate in response to variation in the social and ecological environments individuals experience indicates some degree of flexibility in vocal production...|$|R

5|$|Barnes {{fell for}} a duck {{in his second}} over, {{bringing}} Bradman to the crease at 1/3. Bradman received a loud reception from the crowd as he came out to bat in his final Test at Lord's. Bradman initially struggled against the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Alec Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving an appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling from the other end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and the ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another <b>close</b> <b>call,</b> Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first twenty minutes as Australia had only 14 after the first half-hour. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E
