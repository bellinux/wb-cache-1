Freezing and thawing damage {{is one of}} the major problems of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> in cold climate. Cracking and splitting are the most common results of {{freezing and}} thawing deterioration in <b>concrete</b> <b>dam.</b> The cracking problem owing to freezing and thawing was investigated by making sue of finite element methods. The interpretation of the mechanism of failure was also given. In order to compute the thermal stress fields of <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> caused by freezing and thawing, the temperature changes versus seasons is determined according to measured data. The temperature fields of <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> versus seasons are simulated by using finite element method. Basing on the computational results of the temperature fields of <b>concrete</b> <b>dam,</b> the thermal stress fields are calculated numerically. The researches show that the first principal stress of <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> at downstream surface can exceed the tensile strength of concrete material. The numerical simulation results of fractured regions of <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> agreed with practical observed data. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{study on}} {{diagnosis}} method of concrete crack behavior abnormality {{has always been}} a hot spot and difficulty in the safety monitoring field of hydraulic structure. Based on the performance of <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> crack behavior abnormality in parametric statistical model and nonparametric statistical model, the internal relation between <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> crack behavior abnormality and statistical change point theory is deeply analyzed from the model structure instability of parametric statistical model and change of sequence distribution law of nonparametric statistical model. On this basis, through the reduction of change point problem, the establishment of basic nonparametric change point model, and asymptotic analysis on test method of basic change point problem, the nonparametric change point diagnosis method of <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> crack behavior abnormality is created in consideration of the situation that in practice <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> crack behavior may have more abnormality points.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} the seismic analysis of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> with consideration of material nonlinearity. Based {{on a consistent}} rate-dependent model and two thermodynamics-based models, two thermodynamics-based rate-dependent constitutive models were developed with consideration {{of the influence of}} the strain rate. They can describe the dynamic behavior of concrete and be applied to nonlinear seismic analysis of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> taking into account the rate sensitivity of concrete. With the two models, a nonlinear analysis of the seismic response of the Koyna Gravity Dam and the Dagangshan Arch Dam was conducted. The results were compared with those of a linear elastic model and two rate-independent thermodynamics-based constitutive models, and the influences of constitutive models and strain rate on the seismic response of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> were discussed. It can be concluded from the analysis that, during seismic response, the tensile stress is the control stress in the design and seismic safety evaluation of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams.</b> In different models, the plastic strain and plastic strain rate of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> show a similar distribution. When the influence of the strain rate is considered, the maximum plastic strain and plastic strain rate decrease...|$|R

Based on that, the research on high <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> is conducted in this paper, using the method of finite element simulation. It is proven that self-weight action has more influence on the stress of arch crests of galleries existing in high <b>concrete</b> <b>dams,</b> especially the galleries whose overlying concrete height is relatively high.

40|$|The {{temperature}} field of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> in operational stages is dominantly influenced by variations in environmental seasonal temperature and climatic conditions.

In this study, a critical review of the current state-of-the-art of temperature models for determining temperature distribution including the main environmental parameters influencing the temperature distribution for <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> in operation has been undertaken. It is found that, the heat flow in the <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> currently is approximated as conduction only and the classical Fourier heat conduction models are adopted as the governing equations to define heat flow mechanisms in the dam.

40|$|In {{the article}} the authors analyze {{numerical}} modeling {{results of the}} stress-strain state of a combined dam created by construction of a higher rockfill dam with a reinforced concrete face behind the downstream face of the <b>concrete</b> <b>dam.</b> The analysis {{was conducted on the}} example of the design of 150 meter high New Exchequer dam (USA). Numerical modeling was conducted with consideration of non-linearity of soils deformation as well as non-linear behavior of the interaction “concrete - soil”, “concrete - concrete”. The analysis showed that though in a combined <b>dam</b> the <b>concrete</b> part gets additional displacements and settlements, its stress state remains favorable without appearance of tensile stresses and opening of the contact “concrete - rock”. This is {{explained by the fact that}} on the top the <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> is weightened by the reservoir hydrostatic pressure. The role of rockfill lateral pressure on the <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> stress state is small. There may be expected sliding of soil in relation to the <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> downstream face due to the loss of its shear strength. Besides, decompaction of the contact "soil - concrete" may occur, as earthfill will have considerable displacements in the direction from the <b>concrete</b> <b>dam.</b> Due to this fact the loads from the earthfill weight do not actually transfer to the <b>concrete</b> <b>dam.</b> The most critical zone in the combined dam is the interface of the reinforced concrete face with the <b>concrete</b> <b>dam.</b> Under the action of the hydrostatic pressure the earth-fill under the face will have considerable settlements and displacements, because soil slides in relation to the <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> downstream face. This results in considerable openings (10 cm) and shear displacements (50 сm) in the perimeter joint. The results of the numerical modeling are confirmed by the presence of seepage in New Exchequer dam, which led to the necessity of its repair. Large displacements do not allow using traditional sealing like copper water stops in the perimeter joint of combined dams. The sealing should be made of geo-membrane with placement of an asphalt pad under the face. Due to bending deformations in the lower part of the reinforced concrete face considerable tensile forces may occur. It is recommended to arrange a transverse joint in this part of the face...|$|R

40|$|Safety {{control of}} <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> is {{required}} {{due to the}} potential great loss of life and property in case of dam failure. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to feed back the operational control loads for <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> displacement using the maximum entropy method. The proposed method is not aimed at a judgement about the safety conditions of the dam. When a strong trend-line effect is evident, the method should be carefully applied. In these cases, the hydrostatic and temperature effects are added to the irreversible displacements, thus maximum operational loads should be accordingly reduced. The probability density function for the extreme load effect component of dam displacement can be selected by employing the principle of maximum entropy, which is effective to construct the least subjective probability density distribution merely given the moments information from the stated data. The critical load effect component in the warning criterion can be determined through the corresponding cumulative distribution function obtained by the maximum entropy method. Then the control loads feedback of <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> displacement is realized by the proposed warning criterion. The proposed method is applied to a <b>concrete</b> <b>dam.</b> A comparison of the results shows that the maximum entropy method can feed back rational control loads for the dam displacement.
