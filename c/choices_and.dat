5|$|Gumball is a 1983 {{video game}} by Robert Cook and Broderbund {{in which the}} player {{controls}} the valves of a maze-like machine to sort gumballs by their color. The player meets the quota of each level to earn their character—a factory worker—a promotion, resulting in a raise in difficulty with more color <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> defective gumballs to exclude. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived of the game's machine-sorting concept, and Cook, the designer, added the gumball conceit and built the core gameplay within a week. He later returned to add sound, decorative features, and a secret image that was only found three decades after the game's release. Gumball debuted at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show and released for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. Reviewers separately noted {{the difficulty of the}} game's later stages, praised its comical elements, and commented on the social role of simulating mundane work. The game did not become popular and its copies became rare.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore racial {{differences}} in home and community-based service (HCBS) use <b>and</b> perceived <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> control in frail elders ages 65 and older participating in the Money Follows the Person (MFP) demonstration program in Connecticut using the Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Service Utilization (1995). The comparison of Black and White program participants provides insight both for clinicians who work directly with frail elders and for researchers who seek to contribute to the gerontological field. This dissertation used secondary data collected from quality of life (QOL) interviews of (N= 659) MFP participants who have transitioned from a nursing home into a community-living arrangement. Data from a subsample (n= 240) of participants were used to examine whether HCBS contributed to <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> control outcomes, as well to determine the factors that predict HCBS use. <b>Choice</b> <b>and</b> control was measured as <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> control in daily activities <b>and</b> <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> control in service coordination (choice in services; choice in paid help). Multivariate methods were used to predict service use <b>and</b> perceived <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> control. Results show that there are racial differences in <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> control in daily activities and service coordination. Further, functional services (homemaking, companion, and home-delivered meals services) predicted <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> control in daily activities as well as choice in services. Black participants with more Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) limitations were more likely to report <b>choice</b> in services, <b>and</b> Black women were less likely to use functional services. Lastly, among White participants, those receiving services from a live-in aide had lower <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> control in daily living activities, and for Blacks, participants with functional care had higher <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> control scores. Directions for future research are discussed. Study findings provide insight for the future of long term services and supports (LTSS) ...|$|R

He was on the verge of quitting, until Presley ordered the Hill and Range personnel out of the studio.

5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E

Originally a PlayStation 3-exclusive under Sony titled Adrift, it was cancelled in 2011 and later purchased by Capcom which resurrected it as a multiplatform game. General praise was given for the world design, Olivier Deriviere's soundtrack, the ambition of the story and the Memory Remix segments, while the main criticisms laid against other aspects of the story, poor design <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> formulaic combat.|$|E

This also happens by making people used to take sequential <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> fund voting into account when issues are formed and then submitted for decision.

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E
