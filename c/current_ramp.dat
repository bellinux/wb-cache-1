40|$|Experiments {{were done}} using {{guinea-pig}} sympathetic neurones dissociated from the stellate ganglia to establish whether calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) modulated action potential (AP) generation in mammalian neurones. Using measurements of intracellular calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) with the Ca 2 +-sensitive dye fluo- 3, we demonstrated that 10 mm caffeine activated ryanodine receptors and caused {{a rise in}} [Ca 2 +]i in both Ca 2 +-containing and Ca 2 +-deficient solutions. We also demonstrated that combined treatment with caffeine and 1 μm thapsigargin or caffeine and 20 μm ryanodine blocked subsequent caffeine-induced elevations of [Ca 2 +]i. Treatment with thapsigargin, ryanodine or 200 μm Cd 2 + to disrupt CICR decreased the latency to AP generation during 400 ms depolarizing <b>current</b> <b>ramps</b> using the perforated patch whole cell patch clamp in current clamp mode. Treatment with 500 μm tetraethylammonium also decreased the latency to AP generation during depolarizing <b>current</b> <b>ramps</b> in control cells, but not in cells pretreated with thapsigargin to deplete internal Ca 2 + stores. In summary, we propose that an outward current, carried {{at least in part}} through BK channels, is activated by CICR at membrane voltages approaching the threshold for AP initiation and that this current opposed depolarizing <b>current</b> <b>ramps</b> applied to guinea-pig sympathetic stellate neurones...|$|R

We injected <b>current</b> <b>ramps</b> of variable dV/dt into relay cells that were sufficiently hyperpolarized to de-inactivate IT completely. Higher values of dV/dt activated an LTS.

To explore potential nucleus-specific burst features, we compared the membrane properties of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and pulvinar nucleus relay neurons using in vitro whole-cell recording in juvenile and adult tree shrew (Tupaia) tissue slices. We injected <b>current</b> <b>ramps</b> of variable slope into neurons that were sufficiently hyperpolarized to de-inactivate T-type calcium channels. In {{a small percentage of}} juvenile pulvinar and dLGN neurons, an LTS could not be evoked. In the remaining juvenile neurons and in all adult dLGN neurons, a single LTS could be evoked by <b>current</b> <b>ramps.</b> However, in the adult pulvinar, <b>current</b> <b>ramps</b> evoked multiple LTSs in � 70 % of recorded neurons. Using immunohistochemistry, Western blot techniques, unbiased stereology, and confocal and electron microscopy, we found that pulvinar neurons expressed more T-type calcium channels (Ca v 3. 2) and more small conductance potassium channels (SK 2) than dLGN neurons and that the pulvinar nucleus contained a higher glia-to-neuron ratio than the dLGN. Hodgkin–Huxley-type compartmental models revealed that the distinct firing modes could be replicated by manipulating T-type calcium and SK 2 channel density, distribution, and kinetics.

5000|$|Neural {{accommodation}} or neuronal accommodation {{occurs when}} a neuron or muscle cell is depolarised by slowly rising <b>current</b> (<b>ramp</b> depolarisation) in vitro. The Hodgkin-Huxley model also shows accommodation. Sudden depolarisation of a nerve evokes propagated action potential by activating voltage-gated fast sodium channels incorporated in the cell membrane if the depolarisation {{is strong enough to}} reach threshold. The open sodium channels allow more sodium ions to flow into the cell and resulting in further depolarisation, which will subsequently open even more sodium channels. At a certain moment this process becomes regenerative (vicious cycle) and results in the rapid ascending phase of action potential. In parallel with the depolarisation and sodium channel activation, the inactivation process of the sodium channels is also driven by depolarisation. Since inactivation is much slower than activation process, during the regenerative phase of action potential, inactivation is unable to prevent the [...] "chain reaction"-like rapid increase in the membrane voltage.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} {{simulations}} of LHCD in JET closely comparing the simulation results to the available experimental data. The simulations are performed all over the relevant discharge duration by ASTRA. The LHCD module, FRTC, {{is based on a}} standard Ray tracing Fokker Planck model. The main purpose of the paper is to understand the present LHCD experiments issues within the limit of the LH linear propagation model. Such main issues are: i) analysis of Non Resonant Collisional Absorption (NRCA) of LH wave power at JET during the <b>current</b> <b>ramp</b> up phase and in steady state scenarios, ii) the associated problem of lack of penetration of LHCD in high density plasmas, iii) current diffusion during the LHCD assisted <b>current</b> <b>ramp</b> up and iv) assessment of the current profile alignment in JET Steady State (SS) discharges in the presence of LHCD. In recent experiments from many machines (FTU, JET, C_MOD) LHCD effects at high plasma density are either completely absent or less than expected. It has been shown, both in FTU and C_MOD, that NRCA of LH wave power can be responsible for that. Indeed NRCA is estimated to be small in JET plasmas, at least in the main heating phase and therefore it is not responsible for the lack of penetration of LHW in high density JET plasmas, however here we show {{for the first time that}} it can be effective during the early phase of the <b>current</b> <b>ramp</b> up, when the plasma is still collisional. On the contrary it is suggested that the reduction of LHCD effects at high density may be attributed at least partially to the loss of accessibility of the n|| spectrum effectively launched into the plasma. Current diffusion during the <b>current</b> <b>ramp</b> up has already been analyzed in JET but mainly in discharges without LHCD. Here the current diffusion during the LHCD assisted <b>current</b> <b>ramp</b> up is investigated and a careful comparison between the simulated q profiles and the measured ones is performed over time. The implications of the observed difference are discussed. Finally the important question of the alignment of all the current profile components is analyzed in JET SS discharges at high bN, providing useful information if the steady state is achieved in these shots and how far the plasma is from SS...|$|E

40|$|Although single {{corrector}} magnets {{are designed}} to be self-protected in case of a quench, the protection of some arc corrector magnets connected in series requires the installation of resistors parallel to the magnet to avoid overheating of the super-conducting wire or an unacceptable voltage level.

The required ramp rates and accuracy of the corrector excitations have been evaluated to check whether the leakage current is acceptable.

Particular interest was given to the losses found in tapes in the superconducting rotor caused by the magnetic flux ripples originating from the conventional stator during nominal operation. To compute the losses, a 2 D Finite Element Method was applied to solve the H-formulation of Maxwell's equations considering the nonlinear properties of both the superconducting material and its surrounding Ni matrix. To be able to model all the different turns composing the winding of the superconducting rotor coils, three geometrical models of single tape cross section of decreasing complexity were studied: 1) the first model reproduced closely the actual cross section obtained from micrographs, 2) the second model was obtained from the computed elastoplastic deformation of a round Ni wire, 3) the last model was based on a simplified elliptic cross section. The last geometry allowed validating the modeling technique by comparing numerical losses with results from well-established analytical expressions.
