25|$|In the 1980s {{electronic}} typewriters and later personal computers provided people in China and Japan {{an alternative to}} writing by hand. With {{the advent of the}} World Wide Web in 1991 and the subsequent widespread use of email, internet chat, and discussion forums, people began using computers {{to communicate with each other}} in Chinese and Japanese. Today, increased <b>computer</b> <b>usage</b> and the use of SMS text-messaging, especially among young people, means that a large portion of those people's everyday use of Chinese characters is done using input methods, not by hand. In a 2010 survey by Dayang Net, 43 percent of respondents said they use the computer all the time for their jobs and 43 percent said that they only write out characters by hand when filling out forms or writing their signature.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, {{programmer}} Ken Thompson {{worked for}} Bell Labs on the Multics operating system. During his work, he developed Space Travel on a GE 635 computer. When Bell Labs {{pulled out of}} the Multics project, he adapted the code from Multics to a Fortran program so that it could run on the GECOS operating system already present on the GE 635. Thompson and other Bell Labs employees, such as Ravi Sethi and Dennis Ritchie, played the game on the system. The computer, however, was run on an [...] "interactive batch" [...] model, meaning that several computer terminals were attached to the central computer and each terminal's program jobs had to be submitted in a queue, resulting in long pauses in the game while the GE 635 worked on jobs for other terminals. The company tracked the <b>computer</b> <b>usage</b> internally with a cost system, meaning that each game cost US$50 to US$75 on the internal balance sheet to play. The game also did not run as well on the GECOS system as it had on the Multics. Additionally, the system required the user to type in commands rather than press buttons, resulting in the ship being difficult to control. Wanting to find a better solution, Thompson initially petitioned for Bell to purchase a PDP-10 computer, then US$120,000, for the purposes of writing a new operating system; he was turned down, as Bell Labs was uninterested in spending money on an operating system project after just cancelling the previous one. Thompson, however, learned that a neighboring department had an older, little-used PDP-7 minicomputer which he could re-purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{children}} fail {{to exercise}} {{because they are}} spending time doing immobile activities such as <b>computer</b> <b>usage,</b> playing video games or watching television. Technology has a large factor on the children's activeness. Researchers provided a technology questionnaire to 4,561 children, ages 14, 16, and 18. They discovered [...] children were 21.5% {{more likely to be}} overweight when watching 4+ hours of TV per day, 4.5% more likely to be overweight when using a computer one or more hours per day, and unaffected by potential weight gain from playing video games. A randomized trial showed that reducing TV viewing and computer use can decrease age-adjusted BMI; reduced calorie intake was thought to be the greatest contributor to the BMI decrease.|$|E

2500|$|Another major {{obstacle}} during the 1980s was Brazil's protectionist policy of severely restricting imports of foreign computer {{hardware and software}} to protect and nurture Brazil's domestic computer industry (which was but one manifestation of the country's long-term policy of import substitution industrialization). The policy was so strict that the government regularly seized personal computers from foreign businesspersons who were visiting for ordinary business trips, because of the fear that foreign visitors were smuggling PCs to domestic users. Although this policy was superficially successful, the federal government failed to fund the basic research that was essential {{to the success of}} computer industries in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Brazilian computer users in this era frequently paid two or three times the international market price for unreliable, poorly designed domestic clones of foreign computer designs, since domestic manufacturers lacked the well-trained engineers and basic research necessary to develop their own indigenous innovations, let alone build brilliant new designs from scratch. By the time the policy was rescinded in 1991, it had failed in the sense that Brazil's domestic computer manufacturers were still unable to make advanced computer products suitable for export to other countries, and had severely limited the modernization and computerization of Brazil's economy. [...] By that point, <b>computer</b> <b>usage</b> in most economic sectors in most developed countries was exceeding 90 percent, while in Brazil the equivalent numbers were more like 1 to 5 percent. [...] In other words, by 1990, the electronic office was still science fiction as far as most Brazilians were concerned and they were still doing business exclusively through labor-intensive paper-based processes. [...] This meant their productivity was far lower than people in countries who had already been using computers for one or two decades, and who had, for example, already made the transition from typing and re-typing drafts of documents on manual typewriters to simply entering print commands into word processors.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{research}} was to examine the adoption of computer security software in the home computer environment. The use of the Health Belief Model as a framework to design a model to examine home user adoption of computer security provided the basis for this research. The method of the investigation was a cross-sectional study using a self-reported web-based survey to test the theoretical model derived from the Health Belief Model. The survey targeted individuals who are responsible for the selection, installation, and maintenance of software on their home computers. The data collection relied on a snowball sampling technique that recruited a total of 186 participants who completed the online survey. The research model contains a total of 26 hypothesized relationships that were tested using multiple regression analysis techniques. The research model contains six main predicting variables (perceived vulnerability, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and cues to action) and four moderating variables (age, gender, education, and prior experience of attack). The model explains 30. 4 % of the variance in <b>computer</b> security <b>usage,</b> the dependent variable in the research model. The results demonstrate that certain constructs found in the Health Belief Model are more effective than others in motivating individuals to utilize computer security software. Specifically, the results show that perceived vulnerability (H 1), perceived barriers (H 4), self-efficacy (H 5), and the two-way interactions of age and barriers (H 8 d), education and benefits (H 9 c), prior experience and perceived severity (H 10 b), and prior experience and self-efficacy (H 10 e) had significant effects on <b>computer</b> security <b>usage.</b> Additionally, prior experience was found to have a significant main effect on the dependent variable. Information from this research provides evidence that the Health Belief Model can be used to study the <b>computer</b> security <b>usage</b> behavior of home computer users. Further, the relationship of perceived vulnerability and <b>computer</b> security <b>usage</b> provides a way for practitioners to increase <b>computer</b> security <b>usage</b> behavior through targeted media campaigns...|$|R

40|$|We {{review the}} {{empirical}} literature {{about the implications}} of the computerization of the labor market to see whether it can explain observed computer adoption patterns and (long-term) changes in the wage structure. Evidence from empirical micro studies turns out to be inconsistent with macro studies that are based on CES production functions. We propose a micro foundation for the CES production function that allows for changes in the underlying structure. We adapt the macro model by incorporating computer skills, complementary skills and fixed costs for <b>computer</b> technology <b>usage</b> suggested by the micro literature. It turns out that fixed costs for <b>computer</b> technology <b>usage</b> explain different patterns of computer adoption and diffusion between several types of workers and countries; it also provides very plausible patterns of the timing of wage inequality and developments over time. ...|$|R
