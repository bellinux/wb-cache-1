40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the nature of <b>category</b> <b>restrictions</b> in across-the-board and parasitic gaps. Postal (1993) observes that parasitic gaps in English exhibit <b>category</b> <b>restrictions</b> but across-the-board gaps do not show such restrictions. Munn (2001) argues that independent differences in the across-the-board and parasitic gap structures can ac-count for <b>category</b> <b>restrictions</b> in parasitic gap constructions. Based on a new set of data from Russian contrastive coordination, the paper provides strong evidence in support of the argument that <b>category</b> <b>restrictions</b> should be attributed to the inherent properties of the extraction site, which in this case is the extraction site of the contrastive coordina-tion. 1...|$|E

30|$|Restrictions {{on foreign}} entry, other discriminatory measures, and {{barriers}} to competition {{are the most}} relevant policy areas in the computation of the air transport STRI. For the Swiss air industry, barriers to entry and competition are the most relevant restrictions. For instance, only companies that are majority-owned and controlled by Switzerland, member states of the European Union, or their nationals are granted an operating license (Art. 4 (f) EC Regulation No 1008 / 2008). This provision contributes crucially to the score of the <b>category</b> <b>restrictions</b> on foreign entry. Furthermore, policy measures regarding the exemption of air carrier alliances from competition law and slot allocation systems are assessed as restrictive in the policy area barriers to competition. By law, air carriers are allowed to combine air services and to enter into code share arrangements (Art. 15 EC Regulation No 1008 / 2008). In addition, they may retain already allocated slots from one season to the next (Art. 8 EC Regulation No 793 / 2004).|$|E

40|$|<b>Restriction</b> <b>categories</b> {{provide a}} {{convenient}} abstract formulation of partial functions. However, <b>restriction</b> <b>categories</b> {{can have a}} variety of structures such as finite partial products (cartesianess), joins, meets, and ranges which are of interest in computability theory, semigroup theory, topology, and algebraic geometry. This thesis studies these structures. For finite partial products (cartesianess), a construction to add finite partial products to an arbitrary <b>restriction</b> <b>category</b> freely is provided. For joins, we introduce the notion of join <b>restriction</b> <b>categories,</b> describe a construction for the join completion of a <b>restriction</b> <b>category,</b> and show the completeness of join <b>restriction</b> <b>categories</b> in partial map categories using M-adhesive categories and M-gaps. As the join completion for inverse semigroups is well-known in semigroup theory, we show the relationships between the join completion for <b>restriction</b> <b>categories</b> and the join completion for inverse semigroups by providing adjunctions among <b>restriction</b> <b>categories,</b> join <b>restriction</b> <b>categories,</b> inverse categories, and join inverse categories...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{data mining}} {{researchers}} have developed efficient association rule algorithms for retail market basket analysis. Still, retailers often complain {{about how to}} adopt association rules to optimize concrete retail marketing-mix decisions. It is in this context that, in a previous paper, the authors have introduced a product selection model called PROFSET. 1 This model selects the most interesting products from a product assortment based on their cross-selling potential given some retailer defined constraints. However this model suffered from an important deficiency: it could not deal effectively with supermarket data, and no provisions were taken to include retail category management principles. Therefore, in this paper, the authors present an important generalization of the existing model {{in order to make}} it suitable for supermarket data as well, and to enable retailers to add <b>category</b> <b>restrictions</b> to the model. Experiments on real world data obtained from a Belgian supermarket chain produce very promising results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the generalized PROFSET model. ∗ Tom Brijs is a research fellow of the Fund for Scientific Research Flanders. 1 PROFSET stands for PROFitability per SET because the optimization model is based on the calculation of the profitability per frequent set in order to determine the cross-selling potential between products. 1...|$|E

40|$|A <b>restriction</b> <b>category</b> is an {{abstract}} formulation for {{a category of}} partial maps, {{defined in terms of}} certain specified idempotents called the <b>restriction</b> idempotents. All <b>categories</b> of partial maps are restriction categories; conversely, a <b>restriction</b> <b>category</b> is a category of partial maps if and only if the restriction idempotents split. <b>Restriction</b> <b>categories</b> facilitate reasoning about partial maps as they have a purely algebraic formulation. In this paper we consider colimits and limits in <b>restriction</b> <b>categories.</b> As the notion of <b>restriction</b> <b>category</b> is not self-dual, we should not expect colimits and limits in <b>restriction</b> <b>categories</b> to behave in the same manner. The notion of colimit in the restriction context is quite straightforward, but limits are more delicate. The suitable notion of limit {{turns out to be a}} kind of lax limit, satisfying certain extra properties. Of particular interest is the behaviour of the coproduct both by itself and with respect to partial products. We explore various conditions under which the coproducts are ``extensive'' in the sense that the total category (of the related partial map category) becomes an extensive category. When partial limits are present, they become ordinary limits in the total category. Thus, when the coproducts are extensive we obtain as the total category a lextensive category. This provides, in particular, a description of the extensive completion of a distributive category. Comment: 39 page...|$|R

40|$|<b>Restriction</b> <b>categories</b> were {{introduced}} {{as a simple}} equational axiomatisation for categories of partial maps such as those which arise in the foundations of computability theory. A restriction structure on a category is given by an operation obeying four simple axioms, that assigns to each morphism of the category an endomorphism of its domain {{to be thought of}} as the partial identity representing the degree of definition. In this paper, we show that <b>restriction</b> <b>categories</b> can be seen as a kind of enriched category; this allows their theory to be studied by way of the enrichment.

Beyond exhibiting <b>restriction</b> <b>categories</b> as enriched categories, we show that varying the base of this enrichment also allows the important notions of join and range <b>restriction</b> <b>category</b> to be understood in the same manner. 19 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{different}} speaking rates, a non-linear fluctuation occurs in speech pattern versus time axis which {{needs to be}} eliminated. DP-matching is a dynamic programming (DP) based pattern matching algorithm which uses a time normalization effect where the fluctuations in the time axis are modeled using a non-linear time-warping function. Considering any two speech patterns, we {{can get rid of}} their timing differences by warping the time axis of one so that the maximum coincidence is attained with the other. Moreover, if the warping function is allowed to take any possible value, very less distinction can be made between words belonging {{to different}} categories.

40|$|AbstractGiven a {{category}} with a stable system of monics, one can form the corresponding category of partial maps. To each map {{in this category}} there is, on {{the domain of the}} map, an associated idempotent, which measures the degree of partiality. This structure is captured abstractly by the notion of a <b>restriction</b> <b>category,</b> in which every arrow is required to have such an associated idempotent. Categories with a stable system of monics, functors preserving this structure, and natural transformations which are cartesian with respect to the chosen monics, form a 2 -category which we call MCat. The construction of categories of partial maps provides a 2 -functor Par:MCat→Cat. We show that Par can be made into an equivalence of 2 -categories between MCat and a 2 -category of <b>restriction</b> <b>categories.</b> The underlying ordinary functor Par 0 :MCat 0 →Cat 0 of the above 2 -functor Par turns out to be monadic, and, from this, we deduce the completeness and cocompleteness of the 2 -categories of M-categories and of <b>restriction</b> <b>categories.</b> We also consider {{the problem of how to}} turn a formal system of subobjects into an actual system of subobjects. A formal system of subobjects is given by a functor into the category sLat of semilattices.
