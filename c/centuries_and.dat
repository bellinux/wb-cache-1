5|$|Having {{broken through}} {{at the end}} of the {{preceding}} summer, Harvey played his first full season for Victoria in 1953-54. He scored two <b>centuries</b> <b>and</b> five half-centuries against full-strength teams from other states. He was hailed as the best player outside the Australian Test team, and at the start of the following season, Harvey was included in an Australian XI for a match against the touring England team for a Test trial match. However, rain curtailed the match and turned the playing surface into a sticky wicket hostile to batting. Harvey made only seven in his solitary innings. He played in all of Victoria's matches for the season, but his form slumped and he was overlooked for state selection until 1958-59, when he regained his position and made 97 and 86 in consecutive innings. However, the following season, he made only sporadic appearances and was dropped after some low scores. He shone mainly for Fitzroy; his club first-grade records for the most career runs and <b>centuries,</b> <b>and</b> the most runs in a season, still stand. He ended his first-grade career in 196061 with 19 <b>centuries</b> <b>and</b> 9,146 runs at an average of 36.15 from 247 matches.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{to other}} parts of Latin America, slavery played a much lesser role in the {{development}} of the Argentine economy, mostly because of the absence of gold mines and sugar plantations, which would have demanded huge numbers of slave workers.
