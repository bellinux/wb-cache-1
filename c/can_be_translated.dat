5|$|The name {{cerebellum}} is {{a diminutive}} of cerebrum (brain); it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>translated</b> literally as little brain. The Latin {{name is a}} direct translation of the Ancient Greek παρεγκεφαλίς (parencephalis), which {{was used in the}} works of Aristotle, the first known writer to describe the structure. No other name is used in the English-language literature, but historically a variety of Greek or Latin-derived names have been used, including cerebrum parvum, encephalion, encranion, cerebrum posterius, and parencephalis.|$|E
5|$|There is an inherent, {{systemic}} {{problem with}} any metric based on comparing {{with one or}} a few reference translations: in real life, sentences <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>translated</b> in many different ways, sometimes with no overlap. Therefore, the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result by a computer differs from just a few human translations is flawed. HyTER is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially many ways to render the meaning of the translation in practice means HyTER also is only an approximation.|$|E

5|$|Copper medals {{were struck}} to commemorate {{each of the}} contestants. The obverse side of these {{contained}} {{a picture of the}} respective fighter; the reverse had the Latin inscription Bella! Horrida bella! (a quotation from Virgil which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>translated</b> as wars, horrible wars) and the words Strength and magnanimity in the case of Perrins, and Science and intrepidity for that of Johnson. Chaloner has speculated that these may have been produced by his employers and says that they bear similarities with the work of a French die maker called Ponthon who was supplying the firm with industrial items from at least 1791. The National Portrait Gallery holds two pictures of the Banbury fight, one being an etching published by George Smeeton in 1812, and the other by Joseph Grozer in 1789.|$|E
5|$|Since 2003, {{the park}} is under the {{administrative}} authority of the 'Northern Pindus Management Body'. This authority {{is responsible for the}} ecological management of a much larger region that includes eight protected areas in Greece, also part of the Natura 2000, an initiative by the governments of the European Union that aims to protect the most seriously threatened habitats and species across Europe. The 'Northern Pindus Management Body', together with the local forest service, is responsible for regulating human activities and maintaining the ecological value of the protected area. However,until now this target remains elusive, {{because of a lack of}} expertise and of a science-based management plan. A great need therefore exists to conduct conservation-oriented research that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>translated</b> directly into practical management proposals.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} an {{important}} need to link the economic, cultural, and ecological imperatives of development in the context of tourism enterprises, there is the key question of implementation and how the idea of sustainable tourism enterprises <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>translated</b> into reality: formulation of strategies and how they may be expected to interact with important aspects of indigenous culture. In addition to being locally directed and relevant, the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an indigenous community should be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature to be exploited, or an incidental characteristic that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.|$|E
