40|$|If a {{taxpayer}} borrows money, the borrowed funds {{are not included}} in the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s gross income. That treatment is proper even though the taxpayer has increased his assets by the amount he borrowed because he also has created a corresponding liability to pay back the loan. The taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s net: wealth has not increased. 2 ̆ 7 The more difficult and interesting questions arise when the taxpayer fails to repay the loan. At first blush, it would appear that upon <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> a loan, the taxpayer should have income for the amount that was cancelled. However, the current tax treatment is not that simple. A number of exceptions exist to the straightforward treatment under which the cancellation requires the taxpayer to recognize income. Some of those exceptions reflect an application of normal tax principles while others exist for programmatic purposes. Those exceptions make the tax treatment <b>of</b> <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> particularly complex. The goal of this Article is to set out the tax treatment <b>of</b> <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> including the many exceptions that apply, it first reviews the history <b>of</b> the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> rules, which helps explain how we arrived at the current treatment.

2500|$|Whatever Hillel's position, his {{authority}} {{was sufficient to}} introduce those decrees handed down in his name. The most famous of his enactments was the Prozbul (possibly from the Greek προσβολή, prosbolḗ = [...] "delivery"), an institution that, {{in spite of the}} law concerning <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>debts</b> in the Sabbatical year (Deut. xv) ensured the repayment of loans. The motive for this institution was the [...] "repair of the world", i.e., of the social order, because this legal innovation protected both the creditor against the loss of his property, and the needy against being refused the loan of money for fear of loss. A likewise tendency is found in another of Hillel's institutions, having reference to the sale of houses. These two are the only institutions handed down in Hillel's name, although the words that introduce the prozbul show that there were others. Hillel's judicial activity may be inferred from the decision by which he confirmed the legitimacy of some Alexandrians whose origin was disputed, by interpreting the marriage document (ketubah) of their mother in her favour (Tosef., Ket. iv 9; B. M. 104a). Of other official acts no mention is found in the sources.|$|E
2500|$|Bergsma {{therefore}} {{points out}} the incongruity of Wellhausen's ascribing an exilic or post-exilic date to the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation, since this would conflict with the Sitz im Leben of Israel during, and after, the exile. In addition, Bergsma shows that the problem that this legislation was addressing was a problem recognized by the kings of Babylon in the second millennium BC, which naturally suggests {{the possibility of a}} much earlier date of codification. These Babylonian kings (to whom could be added Ammi-Saduqa) occasionally issued decrees for the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>debts</b> and/or the return of the people to the lands they had sold. Such [...] "clean slate" [...] decrees were intended to redress the tendency of debtors, in ancient societies, to become hopelessly in debt to their creditors, thus accumulating most of the arable land into the control of a wealthy few. The decrees were issued sporadically. Economist Michael Hudson maintains that the Biblical legislation of the Jubilee and Sabbatical years addressed the same problems encountered by these Babylonian kings, but the Biblical formulation of the laws presented a significant advance in justice and the rights of the people. This was due to the [...] "clean slates" [...] now being codified into law, rather than relying on the whim of the king. Furthermore, the regular rhythm of the Sabbatical and Jubilee years meant that everyone would know when the next release was due, thereby giving fairness and equity to both creditor and debtor. Hudson therefore maintains that not only was the Levitical legislation a significant advance over the prior attempts to deal with indebtedness, but this legislation was also eminently practical, in contradiction to many Biblical interpreters who are not economists and who have labeled it [...] "utopian." ...|$|E
