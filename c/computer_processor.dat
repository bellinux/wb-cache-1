25|$|The word {{processor}} was a stand-alone office {{machine in the}} 1960s, combining the keyboard text-entry and printing functions of an electric typewriter with a recording unit, either tape or floppy disk (as used by the Wang machine) with a simple dedicated <b>computer</b> <b>processor</b> for the editing of text. Although features and designs varied among manufacturers and models, and new features were added as technology advanced, {{word processor}}s typically featured a monochrome display {{and the ability to}} save documents on memory cards or diskettes. Later models introduced innovations such as spell-checking programs, and improved formatting options.|$|E
2500|$|The IPAS/APGS use {{computer}} processors {{which are}} tied to the vehicle's sonar warning system feature, backup camera, and two additional forward sensors on the front side fenders. The sonar park sensors, known as [...] "Intuitive Parking Assist" [...] or [...] "Lexus Park Assist", include multiple sensors on the forward and rear bumpers which detect obstacles, allowing the vehicle to sound warnings and calculate optimum steering angles during regular parking. These sensors plus the two additional parking sensors {{are tied to}} a central <b>computer</b> <b>processor,</b> which in turn is integrated with the backup camera system to provide the driver parking information.|$|E

2500|$|The {{technological}} {{impetus for}} the Art of Noise was {{the advent of the}} Fairlight CMI sampler, an electronic musical instrument invented in Australia. With the Fairlight, short digital sound recordings called samples could be [...] "played" [...] through a piano-like keyboard, while a <b>computer</b> <b>processor</b> altered such characteristics as pitch and timbre. Music producer Trevor Horn was among the first people to purchase a Fairlight. While some musicians were using samples as adornment in their works, Horn and his colleagues saw the potential to craft entire compositions with the sampler, disrupting the traditional rock aesthetic. (Others were also working contemporaneously toward this goal, such as Jean Michel Jarre, Yello, and Tony Mansfield, who had made extensive use of the Fairlight for the eponymous debut album by Naked Eyes').|$|E

50|$|Cache {{prefetching}} is {{a technique}} used by <b>computer</b> <b>processors</b> to boost execution performance by fetching instructions or data from their original storage in slower memory to a faster local memory before it is actually needed (hence the term 'prefetch'). Most modern <b>computer</b> <b>processors</b> have fast and local cache memory in which prefetched data is held till it is required. The source for the prefetch operation is usually main memory. Because of their design, accessing cache memories is typically much faster than accessing main memory, so prefetching data and then accessing it from caches is usually many orders of magnitude faster than accessing it directly from main memory.|$|R

50|$|Physics engines {{have been}} {{commonly}} used on supercomputers since the 1980s to perform {{computational fluid dynamics}} modeling, where particles are assigned force vectors that are combined to show circulation.

The techniques can be used to model weather patterns in weather forecasting, wind tunnel data for designing air- and watercraft or motor vehicles including racecars, and thermal cooling of <b>computer</b> <b>processors</b> for improving heat sinks. As with many calculation-laden processes in computing, the accuracy of the simulation is related to the resolution of the simulation and the precision of the calculations; small fluctuations not modeled in the simulation can drastically change the predicted results.|$|R
