25|$|In a {{parallel}} evolution, {{the development of}} 9-1-1 as a national emergency number began in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, in 1959. The concept of a single answering point for emergency calls to public safety agencies caught on quickly. In the United States, {{the decision was made}} to utilize the Canadian number, for reasons of ease of memory (4-1-1 and 6-1-1 were already in use), and ease of dialing. In 1967, the number was established as the national emergency number for the United States, although by 2008, coverage of the service was still not complete, and about 4 percent of the United States did not have 9-1-1 service. Calling this single number provided caller access to police, fire and ambulance services, through what would become known as a common Public-safety answering point (PSAP). The technology would also continue to evolve, resulting in Enhanced 9-1-1 including the ability to 'lock' telephone lines on emergency calls, preventing accidental disconnection, and Automatic Number Identification/Automatic Location Identification (ANI/ALI), which permits the dispatcher to verify the number originating the <b>call</b> (<b>screening</b> out potential false alarms), and identifying the location of the call, against the possibility of the caller becoming disconnected or unconscious.|$|E

50|$|Call whisper, {{otherwise}} known as <b>call</b> <b>screening,</b> is a calling feature that often appears on non-geographic telephony systems and hosted inbound call handling software. It involves the playing of {{a message to the}} called party when they have answered a call, during which time the calling party continues to hear ringing. The called party can then decide whether to accept the call (usually by pressing a particular key whereupon the call will be put through to them) or to reject it (either by pressing a key or simply hanging up). They can also identify the caller by their caller ID number or answer the phone in an appropriate manner for the number that has been dialed.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{mechanisms}} used by signaling methods prior to SS7 (battery reversal, multi-frequency digit outpulsing, A- and B-bit signaling), these older methods could not communicate much signaling information. Usually only the dialed digits were signaled, and merely during call setup. For charged calls, dialed digits and charge number digits were outpulsed. SS7, being a high-speed and high-performance packet-based communications protocol, can communicate {{significant amounts of}} information when setting up a call, during the call, {{and at the end}} of the call. This permits rich call-related services to be developed. Some of the first such services were call management related, call forwarding (busy and no answer), voice mail, call waiting, conference calling, calling name and number display, <b>call</b> <b>screening,</b> malicious caller identification, busy callback.|$|E

50|$|In general, first {{responders}} {{are sent to}} immediately life-threatening situations such as cardiac arrest. Some ambulance services restrict the type of calls which responders can attend, either through blanket prohibition or by more detailed <b>call</b> <b>screening</b> by the emergency dispatch centre. This is because responders do not necessarily have the levels of training or equipment available to full-time staff, and may arrive on their own, increasing risks. Types of call which responders may not be asked to attend (or be stood down if already en route) include drugs related problems, domestic violence and abusive patients as well as dangerous scenes such as traffic collisions or building sites. In some areas, responders are also not dispatched to paediatric cases, although other areas have this as a main part of their role.|$|E
