500|$|Construction of {{the project}} started on 16 March 2009; work on the tunnel started in April and the first {{blasting}} began on 11 May. Construction ran from a crosscut {{in the center of}} the tunnel and outwards; average speed was [...] per week. Work on casting the concrete portals started on 18 September. For four weeks, starting in January 2010, blasting was performed above the Frodeåsen Tunnel, and on each occasion that the 100 or so blasts were executed, the road was closed for safety reasons. Following a public naming competition, the National Rail Administration announced [...] on 5 February 2010 that the tunnel be known as the Jarlsberg Tunnel. The first breakthrough of the tunnel was achieved on 30 June 2010. The second and final breakthrough took place on 1 September. Construction proceeded without any injuries and nearly without any complications. The tunneling resulted in [...] of earthwork, which was used to build the above-ground section north of the tunnel. The last <b>concrete</b> <b>casting</b> was laid on 20 January 2011.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of anti washout admixture with various concentrations on fresh and hardened properties of self compacting <b>concrete</b> <b>cast</b> underwater. In this study, 16 mixtures was placed under water. The main parameters investigated in this study were: various concentrations of anti washout admixture, two dosages of superplasticizers, silica fume as replacement of cement content, limestone powder as replacement of cement content. The results obtained from this study indicates that the increasing AWA dosage from (0 to 1) %, for concrete mixes contain silica fume and limestone powder, reduced the slump flow by (25 - 33) % and (27 - 34) % respectively, decreases the standard washout mass loss by (69 - 68) % and (75 - 78) % respectively, increased the compressive strength of <b>concrete</b> <b>cast</b> in standing water by (202 - 203) % and (266 - 385) % respectively and increased the splitting tensile strength of <b>concrete</b> <b>cast</b> underwater by (169 - 191) % and (229 - 285) % respectively.

5000|$|John Joseph Earley (1881-1945) {{developed}} a [...] "polychrome" [...] process of concrete slab construction and ornamentation that was admired across America.

Earley's Polychrome Historic District houses in Silver Spring, Maryland were built in the mid-1930s. The concrete panels were pre-cast with colorful stones and shipped to the lot for on-site assembly. Earley wanted to develop a higher standard of affordable housing after the Depression, but only a handful of the houses were built before he died; written records of his <b>concrete</b> <b>casting</b> techniques were destroyed in a fire. Less well-known, but just as impressive, is the Dr. Fealy Polychrome House that Earley built atop a hill in Southeast Washington, D.C. overlooking the city.
