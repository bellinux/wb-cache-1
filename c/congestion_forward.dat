40|$|We analyze welfare {{properties}} of two-settlement systems for {{electricity in the}} presence of network uncertainty and market power. We formulate and analyze several models which simulate the different market designs adopted or proposed for many electricity markets around the world. In particular, we examine {{the extent to which a}} two-settlement system with zonal aggregation in the forward market facilitates forward trading, as well as the welfare and distributional implications of having such zonal aggregation {{in the presence of}} network uncertainty. Using a duopoly model over simple two- and threenode networks, we show that for even small probabilities of <b>congestion,</b> <b>forward</b> trading may be substantially reduced, and the market power mitigating effect of forward markets (as shown in Allaz and Vila, 1993) may be nullified to a great extent. We find that the imposition of a delivery requirement on the forward contract in the form of a spot transmission charge alleviates some of the incentive problems associated with zonal aggregation. Even with the imposition of the spot transmission charge, we find that some reduction in forward trading persists due to the segregation of the markets in the constrained state, and the absence of natural incentives for generators to commit to more aggressive behavior in the spot market. In our analysis, we find that the standard assumption of ‘no-arbitrage ’ across forward and spo...|$|E

Several techniques of offering communications in a sensor network use the classical layered method that results in great overhead of the network and high energy consumption.

40|$|AbstractDetecting {{and dealing}} with {{congestion}} in delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) is an important and challenging problem. Current DTN forwarding algorithms typically direct traffic towards more central nodes in order to maximise delivery ratios and minimise delays, but as traffic demands increase these nodes may become saturated and unusable. We propose CafRep, an adaptive congestion aware protocol that detects and reacts to congested nodes and congested parts of the network by using implicit hybrid contact and resources congestion heuristics. CafRep exploits localised relative utility based approach to offload the traffic from more to less congested parts of the network, and to replicate at adaptively lower rate {{in different parts of}} the network with non-uniform congestion levels. We extensively evaluate our work against benchmark and competitive protocols across a range of metrics over three real connectivity and GPS traces such as Sassy [44], San Francisco Cabs [45] and Infocom 2006 [33]. We show that CafRep performs well, independent of network connectivity and mobility patterns, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DTN forwarding algorithms in the face of increasing rates of congestion. CafRep maintains higher availability and success ratios while keeping low delays, packet loss rates and delivery cost.

In this paper, we first study, through extensive simulations, the performance characteristics of four representativeTp schemes, namelyTm New Reno, SACK, Veno, and Westwood, under the network conditions of asymmetric end-to-end link capacities, correlated wireless errors, and link <b>congestion</b> in both <b>forward</b> and reverse directions.

40|$|Although {{road traffic}} {{congestion}} is an objective state of traffic flow, drivers have different feelings about road traffic congestion. First of all, {{in order to}} reveal the law that driver’s mental state changes along with congested degree of road traffic, the targeted questionnaire was designed to analyze the driver’s psychological feeling under different state of traffic flow. Then, {{from the perspectives of}} the driver’s subjective feeling, the new definition of road traffic <b>congestion</b> was put <b>forward,</b> so the pressure coefficient of traffic congestion, which is written as χ press t 0 − t n, is defined to measure traffic congestion pressure. Furthermore, by adopting statistical methods to associate the driver’s subjective feeling toward traffic congestion with objective parameters of traffic flow, the grading thresholds of the unblocked state, mild congested state, moderate congested state, and severe congested state were calculated, which are χ press t 0 − t n = 0. 37, χ press t 0 − t n = 0. 51, and χ press t 0 − t n = 0. 65, respectively. And in the field of application for the grading thresholds, Fourier Transform theory was introduced to calculate domain frequency indexes of the driver’s heart rate variability in the four states of traffic flow, respectively. The results show that the domain frequency indexes of the driver’s heart rate variability present obvious differences in the four states, which illustrates the solving rationality and applied value of the new grading thresholds for traffic congestion based on driver’s feeling.

40|$|With the {{increase}} popularity in multimedia applications over the Internet, {{the demand for}} broadband infrastructure is increasing. Currently, the main path to the Internet from home is through the dialup access network, which can only achieve up to 56 Kbps. At this rate, the access network has become bottleneck for broadband and multimedia applications. Various technology has been proposed to increase the data rate at the access level. Due {{to the fact that}} traffic at the access network is asymmetrical in nature, several high speed asymmetrical access network are proposed, I. e. its downstream bandwidth is significantly higher than that of upstream. Example of asymmetrical access network includes the Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), Direct Satellite Broadcast system (DSB) and cable modem network. Among all, ADSL is the most popular and simplest to deploy. TCP, a connection oriented protocol, ensure end-to. end transfer reliability. This is possible with the acknowledgement strategy, which requires an acknowledgement (ack) to be returned for each data packet transmitted. However, this feedbackcontrol mechanism using ack works well only with symmetric network. In asymmetrical network, the returned ack will suffer from the delay due to the low reverse bandwidth. The forward sending rate, which depends on ack arrival, will in turn be reduced. This will result in low utilization of the high speed (downstream) channel and therefore throughput degradation. With {{the increase}} in deployment of asymmetrical network in the future, TCP needs to be extended to target for both asymmetrical and symmetrical network in order to maintain its performance level. We proposed two extensions to TCP: (1) adaptive accumulative acknowledgement scheme and (2) congestion detection mechanism. Unlike some of the proposals that involve the network layer to implement their solution, our solution features end-to-end interoperability to fulfill the OSI layering concept. The first extension features adaptive ack frequency reduction. Frequency of ack can be reduced by sending an ack for more than one data packet received. This is possible because acks are accumulative. By reducing ack frequency, the traffic load of the reverse channel can be relieved significantly, thereby increasing the forward channel utilization. By adaptive, we refer to the ability for the ack reduction factor to synchronize with the number of data packets sent in a batch. With this synchronization, the ack reduction factor varies according to the connection state, be it at the beginning (slow start), during loss recovery or during congestion avoidance. This is a significant improvement over other ack frequency reduction solutions proposed previously where a fixed reduction factor is used. Congestion detection mechanism is another new idea that we have introduced into TCP. This mechanism enables TCP to detect the relative delays experienced by consecutive data packets in the forward link as well as that between consecutive acks in the reverse link. This is possible by just a simple manipulation on the TCP timestamp values collected in each round trip. As the delay in forward and reverse link is distinguishable, TCP is able to differentiate between <b>congestion</b> in the <b>forward</b> channel from the one in the reverse channel. With existing timestamp option used to evaluate the round trip time, TCP can be aware of congestion in the connection but cannot identify the congested path...|$|R
