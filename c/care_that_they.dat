25|$|Care leavers {{reported}} to the Senate Inquiry into Children in Institutional <b>Care</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{had been placed in}} foster homes for short periods, weekends or during holiday periods. Foster care placements do not appear to have been made in a coordinated way, but 'with expediency rather than child welfare being a primary consideration'. Many reported being placed with people with limited experience of children or with older couples. Some considered they had only been fostered as a form of cheap labour to help out on farms and as domestic servants. Sexual abuse by foster parents, their children or other relatives was also reported.|$|E

25|$|Cultural {{norms and}} {{practices}} {{are two of}} the main reasons why gender disparities in health exist and continue to persist. These cultural norms and practices often influence the roles and behaviors that men and women adopt in society. It is these gender differences between men and women, which are regarded and valued differently, that give rise to gender inequalities as they work to systematically empower one group and oppress the other. Both gender differences and gender inequalities can lead to disparities in health outcomes and access to health care. Some of the examples provided by the World Health Organization of how cultural norms can result in gender disparities in health include a woman's inability to travel alone, which can prevent them from receiving the necessary health <b>care</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> need. Another societal standard is a woman's inability to insist on condom use by her spouse or sex partners, leading to a higher risk of contracting HIV.|$|E
500|$|Although the Contagious Diseases Acts {{had been}} {{repealed}} in the UK, the equivalent legislation {{was active in}} the British Raj in India, where prostitutes near the British cantonments were subjected to regular forced examinations. The relevant law was contained in the Special Cantonments Acts which had been put on to a practical footing by Major-General Edward Chapman, who issued standing orders for the inspection of prostitutes, and the provision of [...] "a sufficient number of women, to take <b>care</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are sufficiently attractive, to provide them with proper houses".|$|E
500|$|Matsumoto was {{responsible}} for the level design. While preparing destructible elements within the environment, the staff took <b>care</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could be easily recognized by the player. So as to create a more direct experience than other Japanese RPGs, the camera view was deliberately restricted around Zael, so the player would be kept within his point of view. A difficult part of development was balancing story and gameplay, which sometimes caused clashes between Sakaguchi and Matsumoto, as Matsumoto would upset the balance and necessitate Sakaguchi re-balancing it. The battle system and AI was refined by what Matsumoto described as [...] "chaotic battles royal between over 20 people wielding swords, magic and guns or ally command systems". The ability to fire projectiles had a big impact on the battle system's design. This concept was a hangover from the game's origins as a science fiction story. For the multiplayer, Sakaguchi avoided the potential for players to be rude to one-another by restricting their dialogue to segments from the single-player campaign. This was possible given the large amount of ambient dialogue in the game.|$|E

The three objectives are so important to successful patient <b>care</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> form the foundation of training for not only first aid providers but also participants in many advanced medical training programs.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{conversation}} that followed between Boaz and Ruth, the pious proselyte said that, being a Moabite, she was excluded from association with the community of God (...) [...] Boaz, however, replied that the prohibition in the Scripture applied only to the men of Moab — {{and not to the}} women. He furthermore told her that he had heard from the prophets that she was destined to become the ancestress of kings and prophets; and he blessed her with the words: [...] "May God, who rewards the pious, also reward you" [...] (Targum Ruth ii. 10, 11; Pesiḳ, ed. Buber, xvi. 124a). Boaz was especially friendly toward the poor stranger during the meal, when he indicated to her by various symbolic courtesies that she would become the ancestress of the Davidic royal house, including the Messiah (Ruth R. to ii. 14; Shab. 113b). As toward Ruth, Boaz had also been kind toward his kinsmen, Naomi's sons, on hearing of their death, taking <b>care</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had an honorable burial (Ruth Rabba to 2.20).|$|E
2500|$|Dr Sam Coulter-Smith, a {{consultant}} in {{obstetrics and gynaecology}} and a university master in the Rotunda Hospital, {{one of the largest}} maternity hospitals in Ireland, said that it would be preferable to introduce legislation to bring in clarity, saying, [...] "We really do need legislation in this area, otherwise we're going to be at risk of doctors working outside the law, and that's not appropriate." [...] Dr Rhona Mahony, Master of the National Maternity Hospital, said: [...] "It is very disappointing that, 20 years after the 'X-Case', we don't have legislation" [...] and that women [...] "need to know {{that they are going to}} get the appropriate health <b>care</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> need" [...] while doctors [...] "need to know that they are also protected in their ability to do their job." [...] Peter Boylan, of the Irish Institute of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: [...] "The current situation is like a sword of Damocles hanging over us. If we do something with a good intention, but it turns out to be illegal, the consequences are extremely serious for medical practitioners." ...|$|E
2500|$|Relations {{between the}} {{involuntary}} Irish immigrants {{and the local}} English population were strained. The Irish and Scots were ostracised by the English, ultimately intermarrying with Black and Native American minority groups to create a single demographic (coloured, which in Bermuda included anyone not able to be described as wholly of European ancestry. Today, the term {{has been replaced by}} Black, in which wholly sub-Saharan African ancestry is erroneously implicit). The Irish quickly proved troublesome, and Bermudian slave owners were instructed that those that hath the Irish servants should take <b>care</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> straggle not night nor day as is too common with them. In 1658, three Irishmen – John Shehan, David Laragen and Edmund Malony – were lashed for breaking curfew and being suspected of stealing a boat. [...] A Scottish indentured servant and three black slaves were also punished. Several years later, in 1661, the local government alleged that a plot was being hatched by an alliance of Blacks and Irish, one which involved cutting the throats of all the English. Governor William Sayle prepared for the uprising with three edicts: The first was that a nightly watch be raised throughout the colony; second, that slaves and the Irish be disarmed of militia weapons; and third, that any gathering of two or more Irish or slaves be dispersed by whipping. There were no arrests, trials or executions connected to the plot, though an Irish woman named Margaret was found to be romantically involved with a Native American; she was voted to be stigmatised and he was whipped.|$|E
