However, these sources, excepting the Brief History by Nikephoros, and the Christian Arab Agapius of Hierapolis all likely drew their information from a common source, probably the 8th-century historian Theophilos of Edessa.|$|E

5|$|Three sources {{report in}} some detail on the events {{before and during the}} battle, all of them drawing on {{first-hand}} Catalan accounts and reflecting the Catalan point of view: the near-contemporary <b>chronicle</b> <b>of</b> Ramon Muntaner, the Catalan version of the <b>Chronicle</b> <b>of</b> the Morea, and the account found {{in the history of the}} Byzantine writer Nikephoros Gregoras (ca. 1359). According to the <b>Chronicle</b> <b>of</b> the Morea, the Catalan army comprised 2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, at least 1,100 of whom were Turkish prisoners captured during their previous campaigns, and whose skill as archers they had come to value. Many of these Turks had even converted to Christianity. The sources differ on the size of Walter's army: Gregoras reports 6,400 cavalry and 8,000 infantry, the Aragonese version of the <b>Chronicle</b> <b>of</b> the Morea puts it at more than 2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, while Ramon Muntaner asserts that it comprised 700 knights and 24,000 infantry, mostly native Greeks. Modern scholars consider these numbers to be clearly exaggerated, but they do suggest that the Athenian army had numerical superiority over the Catalans.|$|E
