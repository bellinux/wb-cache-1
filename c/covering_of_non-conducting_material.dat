Di#erent industries impose di#erent restrictions on the solidification process. For example, single crystal growth requires a planar growth front, whereas casting requires homogenous material distribution. There are various techniques to control the flow in the melt to achieve the required objectives. Magnetic field based control techniques have become the most popular, commercially used methods. The application of a non-uniform external magnetic field produces an extra body force (Kelvin force) in the melt which along with the Lorenz force can be used to e#ectively control solidification and crystal growth processes.

The sensitive element of the probe consists of a. 005 " diameter filament <b>of</b> <b>non-conducting</b> <b>material</b> coated with a thin metallic film. The sensitivities of a filament probe and a conventional cold wire are compared analytically and it is found that the filament probe has favorable characteristics for measurement times of the order of a few microseconds. This is confirmed by the experiments. The probe was mounted in the end wall of the 17 -inch shock tube and x, t diagrams of reflected shock waves were measured at three levels of the initial pressure. The initial motion of the reflected shock is governed by heat loss to the reflecting wall; the wave velocity approaches its ideal value only asymptotically. The asymptotic approach agrees closely with the results of a boundary layer theory. The measurements indicate that the trajectory of the reflected shock close to the end wall is characterized by three different regions; the region in which boundary layer theory is valid, a region closer to the wall in which deviations from boundary layer theory are observed, and a non-continuum region adjacent to the wall in which the reflected shock is formed. The reflected shock wave is found to leave the formation region with a velocity which is approximately 20 per cent below the ideal velocity. It then accelerates toward this ideal velocity, approaching within 3 per cent at distances from the end wall of about 1000 mean free paths.

40|$|The {{miniaturization}} of actuators {{results in}} two major consequences: First, {{the reduction in}} efficiency depending on the physical principle. Second, the increasing requirements in positioning accuracy during the assembly and fabrication process in combination with low cost production. Electrostatic polymeric actuators providing out-of-plane motion which can be completely fabricated in parallel fabrication steps and hence be produced on wafer level are compliant to these tolerance and cost constraints. The electrostatic actuation principle is a surface effect and therefore independent of the volume. In addition, the efficiency of electrostatic actuation increases with a decreasing gap size between the electrodes. The simple morphology of such actuators can be easily produced by UV-replication of polymeric materials. In consequence, the electrostatic actuation principle is predestined for the combination with low cost wafer level fabrication. This paper reports on the first results of successfully fabricated electrostatic actuators produced on wafer level.

40|$|Continued {{emission}} of green house gases has energized research activity worldwide to develop efficient ways to harness renewal energy. The availability of large scale energy storage technologies {{is essential to}} make renewal energy a reliable source of energy. Redox flow batteries show potential in this direction. These batteries typically need expensive membranes which need replacement be-cause of fouling. The recently proposed soluble lead redox flow battery (SLRFB), in which lead ions deposit on electrodes in charge cycle and dissolve back in discharge cycle, can potentially cut down the cost of energy storage by eliminating membrane. A number of challenges need to be overcome though. Low cycleability, residue formation, and low efficiencies are foremost among these, all of which require {{an understanding of the}} underlying mechanisms. A model of laminar flow-through SLRFB is first developed to understand buildup of residue on electrodes with continued cycling. The model accounts for spatially and temporally growing concentration boundary layers on electrodes in a self consistent manner by permitting local deposition/dissolution rates to be controlled by local ion transport and reaction conditions. The model suggests controlling role for charge transfer reaction on electrodes (anode in particular) and movement of ions in the bulk and concentration boundary layers. The non-uniform current density on electrodes emerges as key to formation of bare patches, steep decrease in voltage marking the end of discharge cycle, and residue buildup with continuing cycles. The model captures the experimental observations very well, and points to improved operational efficiency and decreased residue build up with cylindrical electrodes and alternating flow direction of recirculation. The underlying mechanism for more than an order of magnitude increase in cycle life of a beaker cell battery with increase in stirrer speed is unraveled next. Our experiments show that charging with and without stirring occurs identically, which brings up the hitherto unknown but quite strong role of natural convection in SLRFB. The role of stirring is determined to be dislodgement/disintegration of residue building up on electrodes. The depletion of active material from electrolyte due to residue formation is offset by “internal regeneration mechanism”, unraveled in the present work. When the rate of residue formation, rate of dislodging/disintegration from electrode, and rate of regeneration of active material in bulk of the electrolyte becomes equal, perpetual operation of SLRFB is expected. The identification of strong role of free convection in battery is put to use to demonstrate a battery that requires stirring/mixing only intermittently, during open circuit stages between charge and discharge cycles when no current is drawn. 	 Inspired by our experimental finding that the measured currents for apparently diffusion limited situations (no external flow) are far larger than the maxi-mum possible theoretical value, the earlier model is modified to account for natural convection driven by concentration gradient of lead ions in electrolyte. The model reveals the presence of strong natural convection in battery. The induced flow {{in the vicinity of the}} electrodes enhances mass transport rates substantially, to the extent that even in the absence of external flow, normal charge/discharge of battery is predicted. The model predicted electrochemical characteristics are verified quantitatively through voltage-time measurements. The formation of flow circulation loops driven by electrode processes is validated qualitatively through PIV measurements. Natural convection is predicted to play a significant role in the presence of external flow as well. The hitherto unexplained finding in the literature on insensitivity of charge-discharge characteristics to electrolyte flow rate is captured by the model when mixed mode of convection is invoked. Flow reversal and wavy flow are predicted when natural convection and forced convection act in opposite directions in the battery. The effect of the presence <b>of</b> <b>non-conducting</b> <b>material</b> (PbO on anode) on the performance of SLRFB is studied using a simplified approach in the model. The study reveals the presence of charge coup de fouet phenomenon in charge cycle.

In several examples, the ionic conductivity increases for nanostructured materials such as CaF 2 -BaF 2 fluoride ion conductors [14], CeO 2 oxide ion conducting nanoceramics [15, 16], and nanocrystalline LiNbO 3 and LiTaO 3 lithium ion conductors [17, 18]. However, this is not straightforward since the ionic conductivity was found to decrease in other materials when the grain size is reduced [19]. Although nanocrystalline powder of LLT lithium garnet materials have been prepared by sol-gel techniques with a grain size of 100 to 200  nm, the grain size increases considerably to 3  μm after sintering the sample at 900 °C for 5  h [11]. A similar behavior was also observed in Li 6 BaLa 2 Ta 2 O 12 garnet materials [9]. The grain growth of the nanopowder {{is due to the}} conventional sintering which includes heating at high temperatures for long durations. Therefore, other innovative sintering techniques such as spark plasma sintering (SPS) could overcome these drawbacks and yield nanoceramic materials [15, 16, 20 - 23]. SPS experiments, which are performed at a lower temperature and for short time duration (within few minutes) compared to conventional sintering, can successfully minimize grain coarsening during the sintering process that leads to successful fabrication of dense nanomaterials. SPS is widely used to sinter a variety <b>of</b> conducting and <b>non-conducting</b> <b>materials</b> including lithium ion conductors, such as NASICON-type LiTi 2 (PO 4) 3 and LiHf 2 (PO 4) 3 [21, 22], perovskite Li 3 xLa 2 / 3 -xTiO 3 [23], and garnet type Li 5 La 3 Bi 2 O 12 lithium ion conductors [24].|$|R
