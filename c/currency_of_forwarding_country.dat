A rise in exchange risk lowers the holdings of foreign real assets provided {{that there are no}} external hedging instruments.

40|$|Between the 1970 's and the 1980 's, the {{derivatives}} market flourished. Forwards, futures {{and options}} {{began to be}} regularly traded. According to information gathered by The Bank of International Settlements, {{at the end of}} April 2001 the value of over the counter(OTC) positions outstanding was over US$ 99 trillion, while the value of positions outstanding in organized exchanges was approximately US$ 20 trillion. In Latin America the largest derivatives exchanges are located in Argentina (MATBA, ROFEX), Brazil (BM&F, BOVESPA), and Mexico (MexDer). In addition, OTC markets exist in Chile and Peru. Excluding Peru, Chile's derivatives market is to date the least developed. Most domestic transactions are OTC, and consist <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>forwards</b> (US dollar-Chilean peso). The use of other derivatives, such as options on stocks and futures on stock indices, has not gained ground. Economists claim that the blame should be put on regulatory constrains faced by institutional investors, and on market illiquidity. However, recent amendments to the Law of Capital Markets might boost the derivatives market by providing additional investment opportunities. Meanwhile, the market <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>forwards</b> continues to be the most active. In particular, the elimination of the floating band of the US dollar against the Chilean peso in September 1999 increased currency risk, and made investors turned to shorter- maturity contracts. ...|$|R

40|$|Financial theory {{offers several}} {{rationales}} for financial risk management. Hedging enables firms {{to maintain their}} access to internal funds as well as reduces the costs of financial distress. The theoretical framework offers, however, few tools for currency risk identification and for choosing a proper hedging instrument. This Thesis seeks to help firms manage risks better by defining the <b>currency</b> risk exposures <b>of</b> a multinational corporation, by describing their effects on the cash flows, profit and loss and balance sheet of the corporation {{as well as by}} comparing the applicability <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>forwards</b> and currency options in hedging these exposures. The exposure framework is constructed based on an extensive literature review of financial risk management articles. The effects <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> exposures on cash flows, profit and loss and balance sheet are modeled. The model further takes into account current accounting standards regarding derivatives. The model is applied on a stock-listed corporation by conducting a historical simulation <b>of</b> its EURUSD <b>currency</b> risk. The simulation makes it possible to study the effects <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> rate movements and the differences between hedging strategies. The exposures identified include currency risk in contracted as well as anticipated cash flows, in competitive environment, in foreign net assets and consolidated profits, in loans and investments as well as in loa...|$|R
40|$|Urbanisation is {{occurring}} fastest in developing countries, {{with the least}} developed countries expected to have the highest population growth rates between 2010 and 2050 (Madlener and Sunak, 2011). Cities in these countries are going to increasingly be important sites of energy demand and associated emissions. Much of the literature about sustainable urban energy transitions has to date focussed on developed country contexts; as the current sources of greatest emissions, this makes sense. In looking forward, however, if the energy demand and emissions of developing country cities increase to that equivalent of many western cities today, we {{may be unable to}} avoid catastrophic climate change.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{attempts}} to analyse whether forward exchange arbitrage in <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> managed rate regimes behave differently from <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> free floating {{regimes in the}} forward exchange market. For this purpose, <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain, the European Union, and Japan are used as proxy currencies for free floating currencies. Proxy currencies for managed rate currencies are the Sri Lankan Rupee, the Indian Rupee, the Russian Rouble and the Brazilian Real. The US dollar is used as the anchor currency for both sets <b>of</b> <b>currencies.</b> The core <b>of</b> the paper revolves around the pricing difference between the fundamental forward price and the market forward price. Fundamental forward price {{is calculated based on}} the interest rate differentials of the two currencies; this is in concurrence with the interest rate parity condition. Market price is based on the forward pips and the spot rate. This analysis concentrates on the persistence of mispricing availability, the availability <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> pricing differences and the predictability of the mispricing in both sets <b>of</b> <b>currencies.</b> Finally, we also test whether the current forward price can predict the future spot price based on the interest rate parity theory. We present evidence that almost all the currencies have forward rate mispricing. However, we also present evidence to prove that mispricing in free floating currencies is extremely small, while managed rate currencies offer significant mispricing that could be exploited for arbitrage purposes. We also present evidence to establish that persistence of mispricing is specific to the currency pair and cannot be clearly attributed to the exchange rate regime. This paper also finds that {{it is not possible to}} statistically forecast the mispricing in both free floating and managed rate <b>currencies.</b> Further, failure <b>of</b> interest rate parity theory to accurately forecast the future spot rate is also documented...|$|R

As a result the cross border transaction between the countries increased and there was cross border capital flow (Both inflow and outflow) caused Indian companies to face foreign exchange (forex) exposure. In recent days IT industry is growing rapidly. Many companies are having cross border transaction in different currencies, which exposed them to risk of change in exchange rates. Hedging through currency derivative {{is the most popular}} techniques to mitigate this risk. This hedging practice is started with introduction <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>forward</b> in the year 1999.

According to information gathered by The Bank of International Settlements, between January and April 1998, the value of over-the-counter (OTC) positions outstanding was over US$ 72 thousand billion, while the value of positions outstanding in organized exchanges was approximately US$ 14 thousand billion. In Latin America, the transactions in derivatives take place essentially in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. To date, Chile's market of derivatives is the least developed among these four countries'. Most domestic transactions are OTC, and consist <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>forwards</b> (US dollar-Chilean peso). Other derivatives, such as options on stocks and futures on stock indices, have not gained popularity. It is argued that the slow growth of the market of derivatives in Chile is the consequence of a very illiquid and undeveloped financial market. Therefore, in the short-run, the market of exchange-rate derivatives {{continues to be the}} most likely to grow. It is interesting to analyze the impact of the elimination of the flotation band of the US dollar against the Chilean peso on the volume of transactions in exchange-rate forwards. Our analysis shows that this has not been noticeable. The reason is that, on average, the exchange rate has not been more volatile than it was when the flotation band was at work. ...|$|R
