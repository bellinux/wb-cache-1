40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{investigated}} the peak <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> {{characteristics of the}} flux-lock type superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) with two magnetically coupled circuits. The flux-lock type SFCL with two magnetically coupled circuits has the similar fault <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristics to the flux-lock type SFCL using its third winding. The <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> operation of the SFCL is performed by the generation of the magnetic flux between two coils when a fault happens and the fault <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristics of the SFCL are dependent on the winding direction of two coils. To confirm it, the peak <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristics of this SFCL were analyzed based on its electrical equivalent circuit and the fault limiting characteristics of this SFCL were investigated through the fault <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> experiment. Through the analysis on the short-circuit results, it was shown that the <b>limited</b> fault <b>current</b> could be adjusted by the winding direction of two coils...|$|R

5000|$|The Rectiverter {{can support}} a {{temporary}} 150% overload on AC output for 15 seconds. This feature is primarily intended to facilitate startup of various loads. The converter goes into <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> if the overload is applied for longer time then 15 seconds. The <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> exhibits [...] "fold back" [...] characteristics as the <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> is reduced after 15 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Further, {{this power}} {{dissipation}} will remain {{as long as}} the overload exists, which means that the devices must be capable of withstanding it for a substantial period. This power dissipation will be substantially less than if no <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> circuit had been provided. In this technique, beyond the <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> the output voltage will decrease to a value depending on the <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> and load resistance.|$|R
5000|$|Rather than {{add more}} <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> circuits, many {{manufacturers}} {{have chosen to}} ignore the requirement and increase the <b>current</b> <b>limits</b> above 20 A per rail, or provide [...] "single-rail" [...] power supplies that omit the <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> circuitry. (In some cases, in violation of their own advertising claims to include it.) The requirement was deleted from version 2.3 (March 2007) of the ATX12V power supply specifications.|$|R

50|$|Some {{devices are}} limited by power rating, and when this power rating occurs below their <b>current</b> <b>limit,</b> it is not {{necessary}} to know the <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> to design a system. A common example of this is lightbulb holders.|$|R
30|$|Region II: When {{the voltage}} sag occurs in this area, both the series and shunt {{converters}} would exceed their <b>current</b> <b>limits</b> using UPQC-SRI, {{and then the}} current of shunt converter needs to be clamped. The amplitude of <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> is I Sh_limit.|$|R
3000|$|The {{decision}} variables {{consist of}} two parts.

The coordinated optimization not only considers the cost and effect of <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> measures, but also tries to keep the tightness of network structure. Furthermore, the impact of <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> measures on the multi-infeed short-circuit ratio should be considered.|$|R
50|$|Some {{supplies}} use <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> {{instead of}} cutting off power if overloaded. The {{two types of}} <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> used are electronic limiting and impedance limiting. The former is common on lab bench PSUs, the latter is common on supplies of less than 3 watts output.|$|R
50|$|Fault <b>current</b> can be <b>limited</b> {{by using}} <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> {{devices such as}} {{grounding}} resistors or fuses.

40|$|Keywords:hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuse, arc trigger, {{fault current}} limiter, current density Abstract. With {{conventional}} high voltage <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuse, the rated current is usually below 200 A. The rated current {{of the state}} of the art arc triggering hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuse is only 600 A, with its interrupting capability being 25 kA, and still can’t meet the requirements of modern industrial application. With the arc triggering hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuses, the major obstacle to higher rated current and interrupting capability lies in the long operation time of the arc trigger. Increasing the current density of arc trigger notches can effectively improve the operation speed of the trigger. Simulation and parameter optimization of the arc trigger are conducted by using ANSYS 11. 0 to attain the optimal fuse element structure. In this study, the notch current density of the arc trigger was as high as 3300 A/mm 2, and the trigger can be used in the hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuse of rated 35 kV, 2 kA and 40 kA interrupting capability...|$|R

50|$|Ideally, {{there would}} be one <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> per wire, {{but that would be}} prohibitively expensive. Since the limit is far larger than the {{reasonable}} current draw through a single wire, manufacturers typically group several wires together and apply the <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> to the entire group. Obviously, if the group is limited to 240 VA, so is each wire in it. Typically, a power supply will guarantee at least 17 A at 12 V by having a <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> of 18.5 A ± 8%. Thus, it is guaranteed to supply at least 17 A, and guaranteed to cut off before 20 A.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{cooperative}} communications in cognitive radio systems where the secondary user has <b>limited</b> <b>relaying</b> room for the overheard primary packets. More specifically, we characterize the stable throughput region of a cognitive radio network with a finite relaying buffer at the secondary user. Towards this objective, we formulate a constrained optimization problem for maximizing the secondary user throughput while guaranteeing {{the stability of the}} primary user queue. We consider a general cooperation policy where the packet admission and queue selection probabilities, at the secondary user, are both dependent on the state (length) of the finite relaying buffer. Despite the sheer complexity of the opti-mization problem, attributed to its non-convexity, we transform it to a linear program. Our numerical results reveal a number of valuable insights, e. g., it is always mutually beneficial to cooperate in delivering the primary packets in terms of expanding the stable throughput region. In addition, the stable throughput region of the system, compared to the case of infinite relaying queue capacity, marginally shrinks for <b>limited</b> <b>relaying</b> queue capacity.

30|$|Controlling {{short circuit}} current and {{increasing}} power system stability is a contradiction [21]. The application of <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> measures will change the power grid structure, and then affect the voltage support capability of AC system to multiple DCs [22]. Specifically, the <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> measures, on the one hand, reduce {{short circuit current}}, on the other hand, stretch the electrical distance between DC inverter stations. As a result, the multi-infeed short-circuit ratio may be increased or decreased under different conditions. This fact indicates that there exists a coordinated optimization scheme, which can not only control short circuit current within a reasonable range, but also remain the multi-infeed short-circuit ratio at a high level. Such scheme should be obtained by establishing and solving the multi-objective optimization model. Unfortunately, most researches {{pay attention to the}} single-objective optimization for the cost of <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> measures, and there are still no literatures that consider the influence of <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> measures on the multi-infeed DC system.|$|R
