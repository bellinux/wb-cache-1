Contact bodies can simply be the physical bodies themselves (e.g. timber, dowel and steel plate). In this method, when a node of a body contacts another body, a multipoint constraint is imposed. This constraint allows the <b>contacting</b> <b>node</b> to slide on the contacted segment. In this way, a <b>contacting</b> <b>node</b> is forced to be on the contacted segment. During the iteration procedure, a node can slide from one segment to another, changing the retained nodes associated with the constraint.

A node misbehave by dropping packets and acts selfish {{as they are}} unwilling to spend resources such as power and buffer on forwarding packets of other nodes. In such nodes routing misbehavior reduces the packet delivery ratio and wastes system resources such as power and bandwidth.

Existing systems are designed to identify selfish node or malicious node on DTNs. When it finds misbehaving or packet dropping node then it sends information to server.

40|$|The forced {{response}} of structures with complex geometry and intermittent contacts is nonlinear due to contact breathing phenomena that occur during vibration. Therefore, calculation times to predict such responses {{can be extremely}} long especially because highly refined finite element models are necessary to properly model geometrically complicated structures. To alleviate this issue, reduced order models can be very beneficial as they can dramatically speed up the analysis process by reducing {{the size of the}} system and thus the calculation times. In this paper, a reduced order modeling method for the forced {{response of}} structures with intermittent contacts is developed. The proposed approach assumes that the dynamics of the nonlinear system in the frequency range of interest is spatially correlated. The spatial correlation can be dominated by normal modes of the open (or sliding) linear system. Nonetheless, the boundary conditions of a vibrating structure with intermittent frictionless contacts vary in time (i. e. at any time t the contacts are partly open and closed), and the actual extent of the contact area changes over time. Here, this observation is complemented by the assumption that, given the frequency range of the harmonic excitation force, the system dynamics is dominated by one of the modes of either the open or the sliding system, and thus the time evolution of the contact area can be estimated by knowing (a) the normal penetration at the <b>contact</b> <b>node</b> pairs at rest due to pre-stress, and (b) the vector of normal relative displacements at the contact nodes of that dominant mode. As a result, a set of normal modes - referred to as piecewise linear modes - is computed, by imposing special boundary conditions at the nodes lying on the contact surfaces, and a reduction basis is selected and used {{to reduce the size of}} the model of the system. Two numerical test cases, specifically a cracked plate and two coaxial cylinders are used for validation. Results show that the proposed method allows to accurately compute the nonlinear forced response of structures with intermittent contacts both in case of zero gap and in case of initial pre-stress at the contacts...|$|E

Main problems and their solutions are discussed. The computation of the normal force is the second step. Non-penetration conditions are applied on the <b>contact</b> <b>nodes.</b> Finally, during the third step, a tangent force due to friction is applied when the nodes are sticking or sliding.

Moreover, {{it is not possible to}} decide which solution is more suitable than other. Indeed, the two most remarkable solutions are, on the one hand, the one for a unitary restitution coefficient which ensures conserving energy but which causes very important spurious oscillations of the <b>contact</b> <b>nodes</b> and unexploitable <b>contact</b> stress, and, on the other hand, the solution for a vanishing restitution coefficient which ensures stability and a better approximation of the contact stress but is energy dissipative, while the continuous problem is not. This resulted in [11] to design the mass redistribution method (generalized in [17, 18]) which allows a compromise in this context, i.e. well-posedness of the space semi-discretized problem, conservation of the energy and an improved quality of the contact stress. However, and this is also the case for the Paoli–Schatzman scheme, it introduces a global problem to be solved (at least on the <b>contact</b> <b>nodes)</b> when an explicit time-marching scheme is used.

40|$|Abstract—Distributed storage systems need {{to store}} data re-dundantly {{in order to}} provide some {{fault-tolerance}} and guarantee system reliability. Different coding techniques have been proposed to provide the required redundancy more efficiently than tra-ditional replication schemes. However, compared to replication, coding techniques are less efficient for repairing lost redundancy, as they require retrieval of larger amounts of data from larger subsets of storage nodes. To mitigate these problems, several recent works have presented locally repairable codes designed to minimize the repair traffic and the number of nodes involved per repair. Unfortunately, existing methods often lead to codes where there is only one subset of nodes able to repair a piece of lost data, limiting the local repairability to the availability of the nodes in this subset. In this paper, we present a new family of locally repairable codes that allows different trade-offs between the number of <b>contacted</b> <b>nodes</b> per repair, and the number of different subsets of nodes that enable this repair. We show that slightly increasing the number of <b>contacted</b> <b>nodes</b> per repair allows to have repair alternatives, which in turn increases the probability of being able to perform efficient repairs.
