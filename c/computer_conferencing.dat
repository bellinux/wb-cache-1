50|$|Central to {{the work}} {{is a model of}} {{community}} inquiry that constitutes three elements essential to an educational transaction - cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence. Indicators (key words/phrases) {{for each of the three}} elements emerged from the analysis of <b>computer</b> <b>conferencing</b> transcripts. The indicators described represent a template or tool for researchers to analyze written transcripts as well as a heuristic guide to educators for the optimal use of <b>computer</b> <b>conferencing</b> as a medium to facilitate an educational transaction. This research suggested that <b>computer</b> <b>conferencing</b> has considerable potential to create a community of inquiry for educational purposes.|$|E
