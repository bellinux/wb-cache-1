5|$|Interior colour schemes {{varied from}} model to model, but shared a <b>common</b> <b>design</b> approach. The {{entry-level}} XT featured a black plastic panel {{for the upper}} half of the dashboard, with either a black, charcoal, or beige panel for the lower half. Not all variants offered the distinctive colour palette; the sports variants could not be optioned with the two-tone interior.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{there was}} a wide number of {{variations}} to this <b>common</b> <b>design.</b> A castle could {{have more than one}} bailey: at Warkworth Castle an inner and an outer bailey was constructed, or alternatively, several baileys could flank the motte, as at Windsor Castle. Some baileys had two mottes, such as those at Lincoln. Some mottes could be square instead of round, such as at Cabal Trump. Instead of single ditches, occasionally double-ditch defences were built, as seen at Berkhamsted. Local geography and the intent of the builder produced many unique designs.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 is a {{high-bypass}} {{turbofan engine}} (most {{of the air}} accelerated by the fan bypasses {{the core of the}} engine and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000lbf (80kN to 150kN) of thrust. The variants share a <b>common</b> <b>design,</b> but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure. Each is powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and low-pressure turbines, respectively). The fan and booster (low-pressure compressor) evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did the compressor, combustor and turbine sections.|$|E
50|$|Other <b>common</b> <b>designs</b> {{include the}} spring chest, the cone valve chest, and the Pitman chest.|$|R

5|$|The {{baseline}} A320 {{has given}} rise to a family of aircraft which share a <b>common</b> <b>design</b> but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318, to 220, on the A321. They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. Today all variants are available as corporate jets. An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military version like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the world's largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017.|$|E
25|$|All the {{defendants}} were charged in a <b>Common</b> <b>Design</b> of unlawfully and intentionally participating in abuses and killings of {{prisoners of war}} and non-German civilians. By {{the institution of the}} <b>Common</b> <b>Design</b> approach, specific criminal offenses {{did not have to be}} proven individually; rather, by participation in the operation of a concentration camp and membership in the criminal organization of the SS, a war crime had already been committed. The degree of individual responsibility in the <b>Common</b> <b>Design</b> was determined by acts of excess and rank of the accused. This also influenced the verdict and degree of punishment.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, on both {{spacecraft}} a <b>common</b> <b>design</b> {{has been}} achieved for the avionics systems, attitude control and measurement systems (ACMS), command and data management systems (CDMS), power subsystems and the tracking, telemetry, and command subsystem (TT).|$|E
5000|$|Nessey [...] ( [...] ne>nekho ear +se>to bulge)- Large {{circular}} flattened gold earring. <b>Common</b> <b>designs</b> are water springs with coral {{or glass}} stones.|$|R
50|$|The triband {{is one of}} {{the most}} <b>common</b> <b>designs</b> of flag, and is the design of some 30% of all current {{national}} flags.|$|R
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>designs</b> for {{floating}} concrete {{structures are}} the barge or ship design, the platform design (semi-submersible, TLP) {{as well as}} the floating terminals e.g. for LNG.|$|R
25|$|A car {{platform}} is a shared set of <b>common</b> <b>design,</b> engineering, and production efforts, {{as well as}} major components {{over a number of}} outwardly distinct models and even types of cars, often from different, but related marques.|$|E
25|$|A <b>common</b> <b>design</b> for a chevron roof {{is based}} on a batten seam {{construction}} to which auxiliary battens are attached. With proper design, decorative battens can have almost any shape or size and run in any direction.|$|E
25|$|There are {{eighteen}} primary {{structures in}} the Munson Valley Historic District. While most of the buildings have been remodeled, they still reflect the rustic style of architecture which is the <b>common</b> <b>design</b> theme that makes the Munson Valley headquarters complex historically unique.|$|E
50|$|This article {{concentrates}} on threshing boards made only with flint chips, {{although there were}} threshing boards made with metal teeth or according to other, less <b>common</b> <b>designs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bridges are {{the most}} widely known {{examples}} of truss use. There are many types, many dating back hundreds of years. Below {{are some of the}} more <b>common</b> <b>designs.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the {{original}} and still most <b>common</b> <b>designs,</b> Class 1, the pilot is suspended {{from the center of}} the flexible wing and controls the aircraft by shifting his/her weight.|$|R
25|$|Other {{improvements}} included new finishes throughout, new entrance vestibules {{to improve}} the air lock between the building interior and exterior, new baggage claim devices, updated retail areas, new exterior glazing and a <b>common</b> <b>design</b> for ticket counters that includes sunshade devices.|$|E
25|$|Cameras: Curiosity has {{seventeen}} cameras overall. 12 engineering cameras (Hazcams and Navcams) {{and five}} science cameras. MAHLI, MARDI, and MastCam cameras {{were developed by}} Malin Space Science Systems and they all share <b>common</b> <b>design</b> components, such as on-board electronic imaging processing boxes, 1600×1200 CCDs, and a RGB Bayer pattern filter.|$|E
25|$|Opera {{windows are}} small {{porthole}} sized side {{windows in the}} C-pillar of some cars. Typically offered in unison with a vinyl roof, they were a very <b>common</b> <b>design</b> feature of American automobiles during the 1970s. The design {{would prove to be}} very popular, indicated by its imitation by almost every domestic manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Iconography on {{the shell}} gorgets {{comes from the}} Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere. Extremely <b>common</b> <b>designs</b> include the triskele, coiled rattlesnake, spider, chunkey player, and birdman, {{sometimes}} called a Falcon Impersonater.|$|R
5000|$|The {{decorative}} themes on {{the pottery}} are fairly uniform. <b>Common</b> <b>designs</b> are of parallel {{vertical and horizontal}} lines, triangles, stars, S-shaped patterns, and fish-spine <b>designs.</b> Also <b>common</b> were interlaced <b>designs,</b> impressions using ropes or [...] "mamelóns", {{as well as other}} varied ornamental designs. The major part of the ceramics were plain and undesigned, however.|$|R

25|$|In 1835, {{the first}} U.S. patent for a {{horseshoe}} manufacturing machine {{capable of making}} up to 60 horseshoes per hour was issued to Henry Burden. In the mid 19th century Canada, marsh horseshoes kept horses from sinking into the soft intertidal mud during dike-building. In a <b>common</b> <b>design,</b> a metal horseshoe holds a flat wooden shoe in place.|$|E
25|$|The most <b>common</b> <b>design</b> {{of weight}} {{used with a}} belt {{consists}} of plain, rectangular lead blocks with two slots in them threaded onto the belt. These blocks can be coated in plastic, which further increases corrosion resistance. These weights are often marketed as being less abrasive to wetsuits. The weights may be constrained from sliding along the webbing {{by the use of}} metal or plastic belt sliders.|$|E
25|$|A {{compound}} weir is any weir that comprises several different designs into one structure. They are commonly seen in locations where a river has multiple users who {{may need to}} bypass the structure. A <b>common</b> <b>design</b> would be a one where a weir is broad-crested for much of its length, but has a section where the weir stops or is 'open' so that small boats and fish can traverse the structure.|$|E
50|$|As Mississippian shell gorgets were traded widely, <b>common</b> <b>designs</b> have a {{widespread}} geographical distribution. Calusa people of southern Florida harvested and carved gorgets. Coiled rattlesnakes gorgets were {{found among the}} Guale Indians of Georgia.|$|R

25|$|Sir William {{carried out}} {{extensive}} research into <b>common</b> <b>design</b> faults {{and came up}} with his own grenade, which had a central spring-loaded firing-pin and spring-loaded lever locked by a pin. A four-second time fuse allowed the thrower to take cover before it exploded. His bombs were used exclusively and successfully by the British and other Allies throughout the war and 75,000,000 were supplied. His services were rewarded by a Knighthood in 1922.|$|E
25|$|Fourteen vessels were newbuilt by {{contract}} to a <b>common</b> <b>design</b> by the Surveyor's Office - the Harwich, Colchester, Falkland, Chester, Winchester, Portland, Maidstone, Gloucester, Norwich, Ruby, Advice, Salisbury. Lichfield {{and a second}} Colchester (after the first was lost in 1744). A fifteenth vessel - Panther - was built to a local design at Plymouth Dockyard, and two others were also dockyard-built at Woolwich and Deptford to a lengthened design - the Bristol and Rochester.|$|E
25|$|Two 20-gun {{ships were}} rebuilt at Deptford to the 1733 {{dimensions}} - the Tartar in 1734 and the Kennington in 1736. In 1739–1740 another fourteen {{were ordered to}} be newbuilt by commercial contractors to a <b>common</b> <b>design</b> - the Fox, Winchelsea, Lyme, Rye, Experiment, Lively, Port Mahon, Scarborough, Success, Rose, Bideford, Bridgewater, Seaford and Solebay. Two further vessels to a slightly enlarged design - the Greyhound and Blandford - were also built by contract in 1741.|$|E
50|$|The boulevards {{pass through}} {{residential}} areas and {{are lined with}} homes {{in a variety of}} architectural styles. Some of the most <b>common</b> <b>designs</b> are sandstone Romanesque houses, gray stone Victorian houses, and brick buildings with Tudor Revival and Prairie School styles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>designs</b> for volume coils include Birdcage Coils, TEM Coils, and Saddle Coils. These coils {{require a}} great deal of RF power because of their size, so they are often driven in {{quadrature}} in order to reduce by two the RF power requirements.|$|R
50|$|On 13 July 2005, the Justice and Home Affairs Council {{called on}} all European Union {{member states to}} adopt <b>common</b> <b>designs</b> and {{security}} features for national identity cards by December 2005, with detailed standards being laid {{out as soon as}} possible thereafter.|$|R
