25|$|In every {{published}} {{fusion power}} plant design, {{the part of the}} plant that produces the fusion reactions is much more expensive than the part that converts the nuclear power to electricity. In that case, as indeed in most power systems, power density is an important characteristic. Doubling power density at least halves the cost of electricity. In addition, the <b>confinement</b> <b>time</b> required depends on the power density.|$|E
25|$|John Bryan Taylor took up {{the issue}} and began a {{detailed}} theoretical study of the concept, publishing a groundbreaking 1974 article on the topic. He demonstrated that as the magnetic field that generated the pinch was relaxing, it interacted with the pre-existing stabilising fields, creating a self-stable magnetic field. The phenomenon was driven by the system's desire to preserve magnetic helicity, which suggested {{a number of ways}} to improve the <b>confinement</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{science of}} magnetically {{confined}} plasmas covers the entire spectrum of physics from classical and relativistic electrodynamics to quantum mechanics. During the last sixty years of research, our initial primitive understanding of plasma physics has made impressive progress {{thanks to a}} variety of experiments - from tabletop devices with plasma temperatures of a few thousands of degrees and <b>confinement</b> <b>times</b> of less than 100 microseconds, to large tokamaks with plasma temperatures of up to five hundred million degrees and <b>confinement</b> <b>times</b> approaching one second. We discovered that plasma co...|$|R
50|$|These early MFE {{experiments}} {{culminated in}} the Compact Torus Experiment (CTX) at Los Alamos. This was this era's largest and most powerful device, generating spheromaks with surface currents of 1 MA, temperatures of 100 eV, and peak electron betas over 20%. CTX experimented with methods to re-introduce energy into the fully formed spheromak in order to counter losses at the surface. In spite of these early successes, by the late 1980s the tokamak had surpassed the <b>confinement</b> <b>times</b> of the spheromaks by orders of magnitude. For example, JET was achieving <b>confinement</b> <b>times</b> {{on the order of}} 1 second.|$|R
50|$|When {{the topic}} of {{controlled}} fusion was first being studied, {{it was believed that}} the plasmas would follow the classical diffusion rate, and this suggested that useful <b>confinement</b> <b>times</b> would be relatively easy to achieve.|$|R
25|$|The {{next step}} in {{miniaturization}} was {{to speed up the}} fissioning of the pit to reduce the minimum inertial <b>confinement</b> <b>time.</b> This would allow the efficient fission of the fuel with less mass in the form of tamper or the fuel itself. The key to achieving faster fission would be to introduce more neutrons, and among the many ways to do this, adding a fusion reaction was relatively easy {{in the case of a}} hollow pit.|$|E
25|$|Assuming {{complete}} tritium burn-up, {{the reduction}} in the fraction of fusion energy carried by neutrons would be only about 18%, so that the primary advantage of the D-D fuel cycle is that tritium breeding would not be required. Other advantages are independence from scarce lithium resources and a somewhat softer neutron spectrum. The disadvantage of D-D compared to D-T is that the energy <b>confinement</b> <b>time</b> (at a given pressure) must be 30 times longer and the power produced (at a given pressure and volume) would be 68 times less.|$|E
25|$|Second-generation fuels require either higher {{confinement}} temperatures {{or longer}} <b>confinement</b> <b>time</b> than those required of first-generation fusion fuels, but generate fewer neutrons. Neutrons are an unwanted byproduct of fusion reactions in an energy generation context, {{because they are}} absorbed by {{the walls of a}} fusion chamber, making them radioactive. They cannot be confined by magnetic fields, because they are not electrically charged. This group consists of deuterium and helium-3. The products are all charged particles, but there may be significant side reactions leading to the production of neutrons.|$|E
50|$|Spheromaks {{have been}} {{proposed}} as a magnetic fusion energy concept due to their long <b>confinement</b> <b>times,</b> which was on the same order as the best tokamaks {{when they were first}} studied. Although they had some successes during the 1970s and 80s, these small and lower-energy devices had limited performance and most spheromak research ended when fusion funding was dramatically curtailed in the late 1980s. However, in the late 1990s research demonstrated that hotter spheromaks have better <b>confinement</b> <b>times,</b> and this led to a second wave of spheromak machines. Spheromaks have also been used to inject plasma into a bigger magnetic confinement experiment like a tokamak.|$|R
50|$|Of the two, the FRC {{naturally}} has {{a higher}} beta, a measure of fusion economics. However, the spheromak had generated better <b>confinement</b> <b>times</b> and temperatures, and recent work suggests that great advances in performance can be made.|$|R
5000|$|The densities, {{temperatures}} and <b>confinement</b> <b>times</b> needed by MTF are {{well within the}} current state of the art and have been repeatedly demonstrated. Los Alamos National Laboratory has referred to the concept as a [...] "low cost path to fusion".|$|R
25|$|It is, however, not trivial {{to compare}} the power density {{produced}} by different fusion fuel cycles. The case most favorable to p–11B relative to D-T fuel is a (hypothetical) confinement device that only works well at ion temperatures above about 400 keV, in which the reaction rate parameter v> is equal for the two fuels, and that runs with low electron temperature. p–11B does not require as long a <b>confinement</b> <b>time</b> because the energy of its charged products is {{two and a half}} times higher than that for D-T. However, relaxing these assumptions, for example by considering hot electrons, by allowing the D-T reaction to run at a lower temperature or by including the energy of the neutrons in the calculation shifts the power density advantage to D-T.|$|E
25|$|The {{device was}} called SHRIMP {{and had the}} same basic {{configuration}} (radiation implosion) as the Ivy Mike wet device, except with {{a different type of}} fusion fuel. SHRIMP used lithium deuteride (LiD), which is solid at room temperature; Ivy Mike used cryogenic liquid deuterium (D2), which required elaborate cooling equipment. Castle Bravo was the first test by the United States of a practical deliverable fusion bomb (hydrogen bomb), even though the TX-21 as proof-tested in the Bravo event was not weaponized. The successful test rendered obsolete the cryogenic design used by Ivy Mike and its weaponized derivative, the JUGHEAD, which was slated to be tested as the initial Castle Yankee. It also used a 7075 aluminium 9.5cm thick ballistic case. Aluminium was used to drastically reduce the bomb's weight and simultaneously to provide sufficient radiation <b>confinement</b> <b>time</b> and to raise yield, a departure from the heavy stainless steel casing (304L or MIM 316L) employed by contemporary weapon-projects.|$|E

During Smart's <b>confinement</b> <b>time,</b> his wife Anna left and took the children with her to Ireland. There is no record that he ever saw her again. His isolation led him into writing religious poetry, and he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote Jubilate Agno.|$|E

50|$|In 1994 T. Kenneth Fowler was {{summarizing}} {{the results from}} CTX's experimental runs in the 1980s when he noticed that <b>confinement</b> <b>time</b> was proportional to plasma temperature. This was unexpected; the ideal gas law generally states that higher temperatures in a given confinement area leads to higher density and pressure. In conventional devices such as the tokamak, this increased temperature/pressure increases turbulence that dramatically lowers <b>confinement</b> <b>time.</b> If the spheromak improved confinement with increased temperature, this suggested a new path towards an ignition-level spheromak reactor.|$|E
