Examples of complementary goods include software (such as an Office suite for operating systems) and DVDs (for DVD players). This is why Windows and Linux might compete not just for users, but for software developers. This is also called a cross-side network effect. Most two-sided markets (or platform-mediated markets) are characterized by indirect network effects.|$|E

30|$|There {{are some}} papers that studied <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> without {{considering}} cooperative advertising (Gabszewicz et al. 2001). Yan and Bandyopadhyay (2011) studied two <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> {{and showed that}} when the degree of complement between two products is high, {{it is better to}} use bundling policy. Yue et al. (2006 a, b) considered a supply chain consisting of two <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> and the customer needed to buy these <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> as a mixed bundle. Yan et al. (2014) developed a model with two <b>complementary</b> <b>products.</b> In their models, marketing cost was embedded into the model. Wei et al. (2013) studied <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> in two-echelon supply chain. They developed five models, the MS-Stackelberg, MS-Bertrand, RS-Stackelberg, RS-Bertrand and Nash. They did not consider the effect of advertising expenditure in their models.|$|R

30|$|Consider a two-echelon {{supply chain}} {{including}} one retailer and two manufacturers in every echelon where each echelon supplies two <b>complementary</b> <b>products.</b> In the first echelon, manufacturers 1 and 2, respectively, produce two <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> 1 and 2 and wholesale the products to retailer 1. Then retailer 1 sells the products 1 and 2 to the customers. In the second one, manufacturers 3 and 4 produce two <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> 3 and 4 and wholesale them to retailer 2. Therefore, retailer 2 sells the products 3 and 4 to the customers. We assume two <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> produced in each echelon of supply chain {{are the same}} such that products 1 and 3 and products 2 and 4 are the same.|$|R

40|$|Pricing {{decisions}} of two <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> in a fuzzy environment are considered in this paper. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to analyze the changes of the optimal retail pricing of two <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> under two different decentralized decision scenarios (e. g., Nash game case and Stackelberg game case). As a reference model, the centralized pricing model is also established. The closed-form optimal pricing {{decisions of}} the two <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> are obtained in the above three decision scenarios. Some interesting management insights into how pricing decisions vary with decision scenarios are given...|$|R

30|$|The {{concept of}} <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> is {{suggested}} when the customer has to purchase {{more than one}} product {{at the same time}} so that the products could have the required efficiency (Yue et al. 2006). For an instance, software and hardware systems of a computer are two <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> and should be purchased together to have the required efficiency for the customer. But, if a customer is not satisfied enough with a purchased product and purchases a similar product, then these two products will be substitutable products. For example; different marks of software or hardware systems of a computer may be considered as substitutable products. Several researchers examine the effects of <b>complementary</b> and substitutable <b>products</b> on the profit of inventory systems. For example, the pricing decisions of two <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> as the bundle policy is studied by Yue et al. (2006) where the products are produced by two separate firms. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2011) considered a duopoly market where two independent firms offer complementary goods under information asymmetry. The Stackelberg game-theoretic model to solve the proposed model is utilized. Yan and Bandyopadhyay (2011) proposed a profit-maximization model and applied a bundle pricing policy for complementary items. Wei et al. (2013) examined the pricing problem under the different market powers structures between members of a supply chain with two manufacturers and one retailer for two <b>complementary</b> <b>products.</b> Wang et al. (2014) employed pricing policy for two <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> in a fuzzy environment and they survey the changes of the optimal retail prices of two <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> under two different scenarios. Wei et al. (2015) presented joint optimal pricing and warranty period of two <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> in a supply chain with two manufacturers and one common retailer under horizontal firm’s cooperation/noncooperation strategies.|$|R

40|$|Some {{products}} and services are perfect complements to technological devices, such as video games to video game consoles. We analyze how competition between two firms selling such devices {{is affected by the}} fact that they can retrieve revenue both from end-users and from firms selling <b>complementary</b> <b>products.</b> We show that non-exclusive <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> weaken competition relative to when the products are exclusive. Furthermore, competition is less keen when the device producers have inefficient means for retrieving revenue from the seller side, compared to when they have efficient means. Finally, we show that from the set of feasible strategies, the firms will always choose the socially optimal one. A novel finding is that at the consumer side there are brand specific adoption externalities also when the <b>complementary</b> <b>products</b> are non-exclusive...|$|R
