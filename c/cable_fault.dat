For similar reasons, PP film capacitors, often in versions with special terminals for high peak currents, work well as snubbers for power electronic circuits. Because of their high pulse surge capabilities, PP capacitors are suitable for use in applications where high-current pulses are needed, such as in time-domain reflectometer (TDR) <b>cable</b> <b>fault</b> locators, in welding machines, defibrillators, in high-power pulsed lasers, or to generate high-energy light or X-ray flashes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>faults</b> are {{damage to}} cables which effect a {{resistance}} in the cable. If allowed to persist, {{this can lead to}} a voltage breakdown. There are different types of <b>cable</b> <b>faults,</b> which must first be classified before they can be located. The insulation of the cable plays a significant role in this. While paper-impregnated cables are particularly susceptible to external chemical and thermal influences, in high-voltage PE or XLPE cables the polyethylene insulation of the conductor is affected, leading to partial breakdowns and cracks that “eat away” the insulation.|$|R

50|$|Most <b>cable</b> <b>faults</b> {{result from}} human {{activities}} especially ships' anchoring and commercial fishing that involves {{contact with the}} seabed, e.g. bottom trawling. Collectively, these activities account for over 65% of <b>cable</b> <b>faults</b> and occur primarily in water depths <200m. Damage resulting from natural phenomena account for around <10% of all <b>cable</b> <b>faults,</b> but this percentage can spike during a major event such as large earthquakes (>M=7.0) when multiple cables can break. On the continental shelf, waves and currents, especially those generated by storms, may abrade exposed cables and/or cause them to sway in the oscillating currents thus inducing fatigue. Those effects are minimized by cable armouring and burial beneath the seabed. Less frequent but nonetheless devastating are tsunami such as the 2011 Great Tohuku Earthquake of 2011 that severely damaged Japanese coastal infrastructure. Such earthquakes may also generate submarine landslides and turbidity currents - sediment-laden currents that travel long distances (100s to 1000s kilometres) at high speeds (up to 68 kilometres/hour). These turbulent flows break cables in water depths down to 5000m and deeper. For example, offshore Taiwan and Algeria suffered earthquakes in 2006 and 2003 that caused 22 and 29 cable breaks respectively. Turbidity currents also form under major rain storms. The discharged flood waters are so laden with mud and sand that they sink to the seabed and move downslope to form cable-damaging turbidity currents. Other natural causes of <b>cable</b> <b>faults</b> include deep-ocean currents, volcanoes and ice. While such forces may be locally significant, worldwide they are minor compared to earthquakes and storms.|$|R

40|$|Differential {{protection}} {{is a popular}} method to protect aircraft generators against winding faults. Traditional relay-based systems have a limited capability to distinguish between differential current resulting from a winding fault, and the one resulting from measurement noise or current saturation, resulting in false alarms and unnecessary equipment shutdown. Modern aircraft generators are monitored and controlled by advanced generator control units, and therefore, sophisticated signal processing algorithms can be implemented to enhance the differential protection performance. We propose and compare four different differential detector designs, based on the available information about measured currents, for detection of persistent, short circuit faults in the protected windings. Also, current sensors are subject to intermittent, open circuit, <b>cable</b> <b>faults,</b> resulting in degradation in the differential detection performance. We propose an optimal differential protection architecture, based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion, to detect winding short circuit faults {{in the presence of}} intermittent <b>cable</b> <b>faults.</b> In this architecture, the system switches between two different detectors, depending on the cable health state. ...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of offshore wind farms, Voltage Source Converter based High Voltage Direct Current or Multi-terminal High Voltage Direct Current Technology (VSC-HVDC/MTDC) is becoming promising {{in the field of}} large-capacity and long-distance power transmission. However, its extreme vulnerability to DC contingencies remains a challenge in both research and practice. DC <b>cable</b> short circuit <b>faults,</b> or <b>cable</b> pole-to-pole <b>faults,</b> though less common than DC <b>cable</b> ground <b>faults,</b> can cause the most severe damage to the VSC as well as the whole system. In this thesis work, firstly a simple 3 -terminal MTDC system is built and validated in PSCAD/EMTDC. Afterwards, based on the self-built MTDC system, DC <b>cable</b> short circuit <b>faults</b> with different locations are studied and analyzed in both theory and numerical simulation. Finally, a comprehensive protection scheme is proposed against such DC <b>cable</b> short circuit <b>faults</b> in the target MTDC system, combining the sub-schemes in fault detecting/locating principles, fault isolating tools and fault current limiting technologies. The coordination among the three parts is also taken into consideration. The scheme is later proven to be fast, selective, reliable, sensitive and robust in general. Moreover, the specific design procedure is further extended into a general design philosophy for DC <b>cable</b> short circuit <b>fault</b> protection in VSC-MTDC systems.

40|$|Power cables are {{preferred}} {{in urban}} areas for power transmission and distribution because of their high reliability, environmental friendliness and the visual invisibility. Whilst the volume of underground power cable has been growing steadily, the voltage level of the power cables have also increased significantly in recent years. The increasing volume of high voltage power cables brings about technical challenges to the power system operators and maintenance engineers. One of these challenges is the application of appropriate condition monitoring techniques to detect incipient <b>cable</b> <b>faults</b> and to reduce unplanned outages. This paper aims to analyse the causes, modes and mechanisms, among cable joint failures, and to propose an applicable sheath circulating current monitoring technique with the associated criteria for fault diagnosis.

40|$|Abstract [...] In {{order to}} apply {{advantageously}} the symmetrical components theory to SLG fault transients in distribution systems we take profit of similitude of transient components in faulty phase current and in zero sequence current on faulty feeder. Then {{we are able}} {{to take into account the}} load current contribution within voltage drop account of zero sequence equivalent circuit. The result is an Extended Zero Sequence circuit, of better accuracy comparing to Traditional Zero Sequence circuit or Full Sequence 0 -p-n circuit. It presents accurately enough a MV system response to an SLG fault occurrence, whereas traditional equivalent circuits assume only one frequency analysis. Consequently, the new zero sequence circuit is more adapted for evaluation of amplitudes of actual transients or for fault location tasks.

50|$|In the {{transient}} method, {{a breakdown}} is triggered at the <b>cable</b> <b>fault.</b> This effects a low-resistance short circuit {{for a few}} milliseconds. This in turn produces two travelling waves diffusing in opposite directions. These waves are reflected at the cable ends so that they then travel toward each other again {{in the direction of}} the <b>cable</b> <b>fault.</b> The waves are unable to pass the fault because of the arc produced by the short circuit, so they are therefore reflected back again as with the pulse reflection method, which due to the burning short circuit results in a reversal of polarity. There are various ways to decouple and analyse these transients.|$|E

50|$|Cables can {{be broken}} by fishing trawlers, anchors, earthquakes, {{turbidity}} currents, and even shark bites. Based on surveying breaks in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, {{it was found that}} between 1959 and 1996, fewer than 9% were due to natural events.

When maintenance is required, many <b>cable</b> <b>faults</b> may be repaired by disassembling the connector, replacing broken components with spares acquired by cannibalizing other broken connectors, trimming away defective sections of cable, and reapplying the connector to the cable. This sort of repair is not usually possible with Edison connectors, particularly the factory-molded type. If a connector is beyond repair, a new stage pin connector is often less expensive than a replacement Edison connector when purchased from local vendors.|$|R
