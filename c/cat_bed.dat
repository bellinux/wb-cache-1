The beans are thrown out a window and land under Sylvester's <b>cat</b> <b>bed</b> while the lazy cat is taking a [...] "catnap". Instantly, the beans sprout into a giant beanstalk that reaches into the heavens, taking the still sleeping Sylvester with it. The puddy tat awakens and is startled at how everything seemingly grew overnight. Eventually, he walks inside a castle and instantly spots a giant birdcage (with a giant Tweety singing inside).|$|E

Two cats, Mr. Dolly and Che own Dolly’s Bookstore and they don’t {{appreciate}} his visit on this evening. Stetson tries to disguise himself, {{hiding in a}} pile of stuffed animals, but Mr. Dolly really does not want Stetson in his store today. Stetson finds another place to hide in a cowboy hat shaped <b>cat</b> <b>bed.</b> Because he is small, Stetson can just fit into the bed and he falls asleep. At children’s story time, the bookstore gets busy and very noisy, Stetson heads into the evening looking for food and warmth.As the night grows colder, icicles form on the buildings and on Stetson’s beard. Wandering up Main Street looking for food, Stetson meets a nice lady (Kristina Skarstedt) and a little girl, Stetson also meets a not so nice person (Vicky Bushnell), who chases him away.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, many parties have become {{interested}} in Hydrogen Peroxide for monopropellant applications. This has increasing lead {{to the need to}} decrease the mass of the catalyst bed. Hence this has led to a desire to drive the catalyst beds to higher mass fluxes than the prior state of the art. This paper examines an effort which methodically increased the flux level to more than three times that of the prior state of the art in the 1950 - 1970 s. Test data showing catalyst bed performance (<b>Cat</b> <b>bed</b> pressure drop, decomposition efficiency and roughness) versus flux are provided for design purposes...|$|E

5000|$|Whilst Karren commended David in the {{boardroom}} on his enthusiasm in selling, noting {{that it had been}} contributory factor to Versatile's victory, she criticised him for focusing on the balloons, as it was pointed out that the T-shirts higher sale price would have brought in more money. Similarly, Charleine was critical of Richard for choosing the dog sofas, but he defended his choice by stating that the figures quoted by the vendor were more realistic to work with, than the ones from the vendor of the <b>cat</b> <b>beds</b> which he deemed misleading.|$|R
5000|$|Task Review: Versatile went animal-themed {{balloons}} and T-shirts, along with dog bed sofas for their high-end item. Although the high-end team struggled and only managed to sell five dog beds, the accessory team made considerable sales, though these were {{primarily on the}} balloons being popular and leading David to focus his sub-team on them, rather than the more valuable T-shirts. Meanwhile, Connexus went with an electronic cat toy and cat seat warmers, along with large, customisable <b>cat</b> <b>beds</b> for their high-end item. Although they sold their accessories reasonably well, their high-end team had trouble; both Selina's unenthusiastic sales technique and Ruth's talkative approach hampered sales, {{with the majority of}} the four they sold being done by Scott. Ultimately, their sales figures effectively lost them any chance of winning.|$|R

5000|$|In a {{room next}} to the kitchen is a unique {{collection}} of pet-carriers, baskets and kennels. Small dogs and cats were the object of much care and attention, as testified by the refinement and variety of sumptuous places in which they lived, slept and travelled.

Some of the very ornate kennels had three compartments.The <b>cat’s</b> <b>bed,</b> in the photograph opposite, is à la polonaise with a dais and drawn-up curtains, and was made for one of the daughters of Louis XV of France for her pet. Louis XV himself had a King Charles Spaniel called Filou (Rascal). Its bed was a cushion of crimson velvet and it wore a gold collar encrusted with diamonds. Louis XV said of his dog: “He’s the only thing in the world that likes me for myself”. These small ‘pet-dwellings’ are extremely rare and unusual reminders of times past, when pets were often looked after better than the workers of the estate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Behaviour in the 2 -h {{period before}} sleep onset was {{evaluated}} in 90 subjects with normal sleep/wake habits using an anonymous self-report questionnaire. This determined {{the timing of}} events from the initial preparation for sleep. The nature of the pre-sleep environment, the level of Physical activity, and patterns of feeding behaviour were recorded together with self-ratings of tiredness, mood and security. Estimated sleep duration and sleep quality were determined. Ninety of 120 subjects responded. Sleep 'preparatory latency', {{from the time of}} initial sleep preparation to sleep onset, was 77 +/- 48 min; bed time to sleep onset time (sleep latency) was 41 +/- 42 min; lights out to sleep onset latency was 26 +/- 45 min. The estimated total sleep time was 7 +/- 1 h. In the pre-sleep period, mean noise and illumination levels were low and environmental temperature rating was at the median point on a very cold-very hot scale (mean scale scores: 23, 28 and 50, respectively). All subjects went to the bathroom before going to bed. Twenty-five percent of normal subjects had a snack or meal in the 2 -h period before sleep onset. Sixty percentage recorded setting an alarm, 27 % had a bath or shower, 23 % checked door locks or windows and 49 % read in bed. Nine percent of subjects slept with a <b>cat</b> on the <b>bed.</b> Humans, like other animal species, show a complex behavioural sequence in the 2 -h period before falling asleep. A constant environment with limited metabolic activity may predispose to thermoregulatory changes prior to sleep on...|$|R
40|$|EchogenTM, a phase shift, {{fluorocarbon}} gas echo contrast agent, {{has been}} shown capable of producing left ventricular and robust myocardial opacification, persisting up to 35 to 40 mm after peripheral venous injection. We investigated the microcirculatory flow dynamics of this agent in the <b>cat</b> mesenteric vascular <b>bed</b> using microscopic visualization of capillary flows. Four cats (weight 2 to 5. 2 kg, mean= 3. 2 kg) were anesthetized and ventilated. Systemic arterial blood pressure was monitored by cannulation of the carotid artery. Microscopic examination (x 400) with an instrument calibrated for scale was performed by placing a loop of small intestine on awarm water bath stage and transilluminating the mesentery with a xenon light source while videotape recording the images for off-line analysis. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed simultaneously using a TOSHIBA 140 A system with a 7 MHz transducer. Doses of 0. 4, 06, 0. 8 ml/kg (a total of 15 injections) of Echogen were administered intravenously. For all the injections, Visually apparent left ventricular and intense myocardial opacification was achieved lasting up to 20 minutes. A transient drop in arterial blood pressure (25 ± 13. 2 mmHg) was observed with the high dose 10. 8 ml/kg). which returned to baseline within 5 mins. Capillary flow velocities of the red blood cells before and after Echogen injection were 4. 3 ± 1. 7 mm/sec dropping to 2. 3 ± 0. 9 mm/sec, the drop occurred 5 to 20 seconds following injections and recovery was within 40 – 70 seconds. Transient slowing and periodicity of flow was noted in the venule side of the capillaries. but arteriolar capillary flow changed little during brisk transit of the observed bubbles. There {{was no significant difference}} in flow velocity changes associated with different doses (p> 0. 05). Also, margination and endothelial adhesion of bubbles observed in larger arteriolar feeding vessels without slowing of central RBC flow suggests a mechanism for the long persistence of echo contrast bubbles in the tissue without vascular blockage or evidence of myocardial tissue damage...|$|R
2500|$|Frank was {{the first}} son of Canon William Buckland, a noted {{geologist}} and palaeontologist, and Mary, a fossil collector, palaeontologist and illustrator. Frank was born and brought up in Oxford, where {{his father was a}} Canon and the Dean of Christ Church. His godfather was the sculptor Sir Francis Chantrey. Educated at home by his mother, he went, at eight and a half, to a boarding school in Cotterstock, Northamptonshire staying with his uncle John Buckland. From 1837–39, he went to a preparatory school in Laleham, Surrey, run by his uncle, John Buckland, a brutal headmaster who flogged his pupils quite excessively. Relief came with a scholarship to Winchester College, a school with an unbroken history of six hundred years. Here he was taught by the Second Master, Charles Wordsworth, who sent letters of praise to his father. Winchester had a harsh regime, but was much preferable to his previous school. While at Winchester he continued to take an interest in animals, trapping rats and mice, dissecting and sometimes eating them. Students complained of a foul smell emanating from the remains of a <b>cat</b> under his <b>bed.</b> Towards the end of his schooling he was dissecting human parts that he obtained from the hospital on the sly. He was known for his exploits with a lancet. One student with a dolichocephalous head heard Frank muttering [...] "what wouldn't I give for that fellow's skull!" [...] He was not a first-rate scholar, but managed to gain entrance to Christ Church, Oxford in October 1844, after failing to get a scholarship to the smaller Corpus Christi. He joined a debating club and the first essay he read was on [...] "whether Rooks are beneficial to the farmer or not". He became a friend of the curator at Surrey Zoo and when he heard that a panther had died, he had it dug up and declared that the meat [...] "was not very good". When the British Association met in 1847 at Oxford, Frank took along his pet bear Tigleth Pileser dressed in student attire of a cap and gown to the party. Charles Lyell wrote that Buckland introduced the bear formally to him and other zoologists present. This was not to go on for long as the Dean finally informed him that [...] "either you or your bear must go". In 1845 Frank went to Giessen for three months to study chemistry under Justus von Liebig. In September 1846 he made a trip around Switzerland. Frank also attended some of the lectures of his father.|$|R
