5|$|The {{softness}} of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible <b>current</b> <b>density</b> of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E
5|$|With ample <b>current</b> <b>density</b> and ionization, this forms a {{luminous}} electric arc (a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning) between the electrodes. Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization {{is determined by}} temperature), and as per the sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium, {{which is to say}} that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, electrical energy is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.|$|E

40|$|Scope of {{this project}} was the {{investigation}} of High Tc-Metal compound materials {{with respect to their}} application as superconducting wires. Long length YBCO-metal composite tapes could be produced in a contineous process. Especially the use of pretextured bulk material in combination with a partial melt process after cold working lead to critical <b>current</b> <b>densities</b> up to 2 x 10 " 3 A/cm" 2. Using a AgPdMg-sheath alloy allowed maintaining such <b>current</b> <b>densities</b> even under mechanical strain. For technical applications <b>current</b> <b>densities</b> exceeding 10 " 4 A/cm" 2 are necessary. Such high <b>current</b> <b>densities</b> within the project have only been observed locally due to strong inhomogeneities evoked by the cold working process.
