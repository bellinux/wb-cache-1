5|$|Icarus– The son of Daedalus, who {{had become}} insane and obsessed with finding the Sisters of Fate. Kratos {{encountered}} Icarus by the Great <b>Chasm</b> and attacked him. The two battled while falling down the <b>chasm.</b> Kratos eventually stripped Icarus of his wings, took them, and allowed Icarus to fall to his death into the Underworld. The character was voiced by Bob Joles in God of War II.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Marge and Ruth again while cooking {{breakfast on}} his car engine, Wiggum {{continues}} his chase of the two, aided by other Springfield Police vehicles. After noticing a cliff ahead, Homer believes that Marge and Ruth are attempting suicide because of him and, using a megaphone, apologizes to Marge for all the mistakes he has made in their marriage and urges them not to drive into the <b>chasm.</b> Ruth, who had not noticed the <b>chasm,</b> slams on the brakes and stops in time; however, Homer and Wiggum fail to stop and fly {{over the edge of}} the cliff only to crash into a landfill. The episodes ends with a description of the fates of each of the characters involved in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Bravely Default {{is set in}} {{the world}} of Luxendarc, which is kept in balance by four {{elemental}} crystals. These crystals are protected and venerated by the Crystal Orthodoxy, a worldwide religious order. One day, the crystals are consumed by darkness, throwing the world into chaos. Agnès Oblige, Vestal of the Wind Crystal, escapes {{while the rest of the}} temple's worshipers perish to protect her. At the same time, a great <b>chasm</b> opens up beneath the village of Norende; Tiz Arrior, a shepherd of the village, is the only survivor. When he returns to the <b>chasm</b> hoping to find other survivors, he meets Agnès and her fairy companion Airy. The three are then attacked by forces from the hostile Duchy of Eternia, who seek to prevent Agnès from awakening the crystals. After defeating the soldiers, Tiz decides to travel with Agnès as her protector. They return to Caldisla, where they are also joined by Ringabel, an amnesiac vagabond who holds a book predicting future events, and Edea Lee, an Eternian soldier who becomes disillusioned and defects after her commanding officer commits war crimes. The party travels to the four temples, and Agnès awakens each of the crystals from darkness while being confronted by the forces of Eternia. During their journey, the group is aided by the ancient Sage Yulyana and observed by the immortal Lord DeRosso. The party eventually reaches Eternia, the home of the Earth Crystal, and are forced to defeat the leader of Eternia, Edea's father Braev Lee in battle. A column of light then appears in the <b>chasm,</b> which Airy says can be used to heal it. However, Airy's ritual instead sends them into a parallel world.|$|E

5|$|Regret's death {{triggers}} discord {{among the}} races of the Covenant, as the Hierarchs {{have given the}} Brutes the Elites' traditional job of protecting them {{in the wake of}} the death. The Arbiter is sent to find Halo's Index and captures it, Johnson, and Keyes before being confronted by Tartarus. He reveals to the Arbiter that the Prophets have ordered the annihilation of the Elites, and sends the Arbiter falling down a deep <b>chasm.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Old Man of Hoy {{is a red}} {{sandstone}} stack and {{perched on}} a plinth of basalt rock. It is separated from the mainland by a 60-metre (200ft) <b>chasm</b> strewn with debris, and has nearly vertical sides with a top just a few metres wide. The rock is composed of layers of soft, sandy and pebbly sandstone and harder flagstones of Old Red Sandstone, giving the sides a notched and slab-like profile.|$|E
5|$|The Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, a transcontinental auto trail {{extending}} from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, {{was established in}} 1919. In eastern New York, the highway went through Keeseville, Ausable <b>Chasm,</b> and Fort Kent along {{what used to be}} the Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike before entering Vermont by way of the Burlington–Port Kent Ferry across Lake Champlain.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the ocean floor, {{there are parts of}} the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E Deck is an empty <b>chasm</b> within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E
5|$|During the game's present, the war {{has ended}} but {{tensions}} are still high on both sides. The game's primary setting is the Okanos region at the Thirteen Towers, a giant fortress suspended above a giant <b>chasm</b> called the Scar, {{held in place by}} thirteen giant chains said to keep the Scar from growing. Initially built five centuries before, a disastrous magical experiment caused the Towers to be infested by monsters. Fifty years {{prior to the start of}} the game, a new experiment involving the monsters triggers the Scar's creation.|$|E
5|$|In a {{situation}} analogous {{with that of}} other European countries, the progressive internal decay of the Polish Church created conditions favorable for the dissemination of the Reformation ideas and currents. For example, there was a <b>chasm</b> between the lower clergy and the nobility-based Church hierarchy, which was quite laicized and preoccupied with temporal issues, such as power and wealth, and often corrupt. The middle nobility, which had already {{been exposed to the}} Hussite reformist persuasion, increasingly looked at the Church's many privileges with envy and hostility.|$|E

5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful <b>chasm</b> in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{distance of}} the characters and the intellectual and artificial-seeming, quasi-theatrical dialogue is deliberate, depicting their simultaneous connection and isolation. The <b>chasm</b> between Marie and Julien, due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature, is emphasised in the contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker. Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill-suited and for the viewer to question the relationship; they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers. Béart believes that Marie was more alive than Julien, and that he literally wakes up to her existence only {{at the very end}} of the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{most ancient}} {{recorded}} name for Bristol is the archaic Welsh Caer Odor (the fort on the <b>chasm),</b> {{which is consistent}} with modern understanding that early Bristol developed between the River Frome and Avon Gorge. It is most commonly stated that the Saxon name Bricstow was a simple calque of the existing Celtic name, with Bric (meaning a break) a literal translation of Odor, and the common Saxon suffix Stow replacing Caer. Alternative etymologies are supported by numerous orthographic variations in medieval documents, with Samuel Seyer enumerating 47 alternative forms.|$|E

5|$|At 22:00, while {{avoiding}} three drifting fireships, the overladen 120-gun flagship Océan ran aground and was badly scorched by a fireship which struck the stern. To prevent explosion the stopcocks were {{opened and the}} magazine flooded. As the crew wrestled with this threat, the drifting Tonnerre and Patriote loomed out of the darkness. Patriote turned away in time, but Tonnerre crashed into the starboard side of the flagship and caused considerable damage, although fortunately detached soon afterwards. Océans crew then held the blazing ship alongside long enough that the drifters could escape before releasing the fireship to drift on shore. During this effort at least 50 men tumbled to their deaths in the fiery <b>chasm</b> between the ships {{as they tried to}} prevent the fire spreading on board.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bowser's demise in {{the first}} level, this does not stop Bowser Jr. from running through the {{remaining}} worlds with Peach in tow, forcing Mario to chase after him before reaching Bowser's castle in world 8. There, Bowser Jr. revives his father's skeleton, creating Dry Bowser, but Mario once again defeats Bowser by dropping him into a deep pit. In the final battle, Bowser Jr. flees once more across a lava <b>chasm</b> to a larger castle, where he throws his father's bones into a cauldron and revives Bowser in his original form. They attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the game's final sequence, Mario rescues Peach, who kisses him on the cheek. Over the end credits, Bowser Jr. is seen dragging his unconscious father across the floor. He looks at the screen, and growls, breaking the fourth wall.|$|E
5|$|Elaine's role is {{significantly}} reduced for the sequel , though {{the majority of}} the story is conveyed by Guybrush to Elaine {{in the form of a}} flashback. Between the games, the two have broken off their relationship and Elaine has moved to her governor's mansion on Booty Island. When Guybrush appears at the mansion, she presumes he has come to apologize; instead he is looking for a map that belonged to Elaine's grandfather, which leads to fabled treasure Big Whoop. After discovering Guybrush's intentions, Elaine is infuriated and refuses to speak to him. Guybrush eventually becomes trapped at the site of Big Whoop, with Elaine arriving to rescue him. Guybrush falls into a <b>chasm,</b> where he is confronted by LeChuck, recently resurrected as a zombie. As the game ends with Guybrush thinking he is a child in a theme park, Elaine is seen worrying that LeChuck has placed a curse on Guybrush.|$|E

Three days later, Haddock, Wolff and Tintin take the {{battery-powered}} tank to explore some stalactite caves {{in the direction of the}} Ptolemaeus Crater; inside a cave Snowy slips into an ice-covered <b>chasm,</b> but Tintin rescues him. Later aboard the ship, Tintin is overwhelmed by a third stowaway, Colonel Jorgen, a spy who had been smuggled aboard by Wolff, who has been blackmailed by a foreign power for which Jorgen works. With Wolff's help, Jorgen seeks to hijack the ship and return it to Earth, but is foiled by Tintin through emergency sabotage that cuts power to the engine.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} New York assumed {{maintenance}} {{of most of}} the Ausable Chasm–Port Kent roadway at some point after 1920. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the entirety of the highway from Ausable <b>Chasm</b> to the Port Kent ferry landing was designated as NY373, {{despite the fact that the}} small portion of the route east of Lake Street in Port Kent was not maintained by the state at the time. On April1, 1985, ownership and maintenance of NY373 east of Lake Street was transferred from the town of Chesterfield to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and Essex County.|$|E
5|$|Boam's February 23, 1988 rewrite {{utilized}} many of Connery's comic suggestions. It {{included the}} prologue that was eventually filmed; Lucas {{had to convince}} Spielberg to show Indiana as a boy because of the mixed response to Empire of the Sun, which was about a young boy. Spielberg—who was later awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award—had {{the idea of making}} Indiana a Boy Scout. Indiana's mother, named Margaret in this version, dismisses Indiana when he returns home with the Cross of Coronado, while his father is on a long distance call. Walter Chandler of the Chandler Foundation features, but is not the main villain; he plunges to his death in the tank. Elsa introduces Indiana and Brody to a large Venetian family that knows Henry. Leni Riefenstahl appears at the Nazi rally in Berlin. Vogel is beheaded by the traps guarding the Grail. Kemal tries to blow up the Grail Temple during a comic fight in which gunpowder is repeatedly lit and extinguished. Elsa shoots Henry, then dies drinking from the wrong Grail, and Indiana rescues his father from falling into the <b>chasm</b> while grasping for the Grail. Boam's revision on March 1 showed Henry causing the seagulls to strike the plane, and has Henry saving Indiana at the end.|$|E
