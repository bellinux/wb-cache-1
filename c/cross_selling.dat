25|$|Upselling and <b>cross</b> <b>selling</b> are {{sometimes}} known as suggestive selling. When the consumer has selected their main purchase, sales assistants {{can try to}} sell the customer on a premium brand or higher quality item (up-selling) or can suggest complementary purchases (cross-selling). For instance, if a customer purchases a non-stick frypan, the sales assistant might suggest plastic slicers that do not damage the non-stick surface.|$|E
50|$|As {{told in the}} Journal of Relationship {{marketing}} by Kamatura Wagner <b>cross</b> <b>selling</b> {{is valuable}} selling technique used by salespeople to increase the sale by transforming single product buyers to multi product buyers. <b>Cross</b> <b>selling</b> is a technique by which the seller will attempt to increase {{the value of a}} sale by suggesting an accompanying product. Suggesting related products or services to a customer who is considering buying something. <b>Cross</b> <b>selling</b> is mostly seen in restaurants or fast food joints, the terms “would you like fries with that?” or “would you like to up-size your order?” are examples of the cross-selling technique. <b>Cross</b> <b>selling</b> can be most effective when a customer is requiring assistance - where they come to you for the purpose of cross-selling. Since the customer has initiated the sale, the mind set would have already been on the firm and its products. This {{would make it easier for}} the salesperson to conduct the technique and have it be successful.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} an over the phone cross sell could be that a {{customer}} has just switched banks and is getting her account set up with her new bank. After the account is created the bank teller would offer her the cross sell of signing up to their internet banking app that would allow her to access her account details and pay her accounts online. If cross-selling is properly done, it will {{be viewed as a}} service, rather than a sales pitch. A downside to <b>cross</b> <b>selling</b> {{can be seen as the}} same as that of up-selling. This main draw back is known as “over-touching” the customer which in simpler terms means, giving too many <b>cross</b> <b>selling</b> options can result in the customer ignoring the efforts given, and can desensitise the customer to future <b>cross</b> <b>selling</b> offers.|$|E

After Blood and Sand, she was set to co-star with Claudette Colbert in Remember the Day (1941), but another actress was eventually cast. Meanwhile, she was considered for the female lead in Swamp Water (1941), but Anne Baxter was later assigned the role. Darnell was disappointed and felt rejected; she later said: [...] "Right under your very nose someone else is brought in for that prize part you wanted so terribly." [...] Months passed by without any work, and in August 1941, she was cast in a supporting role in the musical Rise and Shine (1941).

5000|$|Market basket {{analysis}} {{may provide}} the retailer with information to understand the purchase behavior of a buyer. This information will enable the retailer to understand the buyer's needs and rewrite the store's layout accordingly, develop cross-promotional programs, or even capture new buyers (much like the cross-selling concept). An apocryphal early illustrative example for this was when one super market chain discovered in its analysis that male customers that bought diapers often bought beer as well, have put the diapers close to beer coolers, and their sales increased dramatically. Although this urban legend is only an example that professors use to illustrate the concept to students, the explanation of this imaginary phenomenon might be that fathers that are sent out to buy diapers often buy a beer as well, as a reward.

40|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>selling</b> is the {{practice}} of selling additional products to an existing customer. It {{has the potential to}} boost revenues and can be beneficial for both the company and the customer. For many multi-divisional companies with product or service oriented organizational structures the attempt to realize the benefits of <b>cross</b> <b>selling</b> generates incentive problems. In this thesis, three problems spread over three business levels are identified. Firstly, management needs to (financially) motivate business units in fostering their <b>cross</b> <b>selling</b> efforts. Secondly, in order to make <b>cross</b> <b>selling</b> happen, business units need to cooperate and to exchange product-related information. Finally, in order to increase their short-term benefits business units might act opportunistically by selling products or services of other business units without paying attention to adding value for their customers. These incentive problems are theoretically examined by applying principal-agent theory and the theory of repeated games. Our findings suggest that an optimized incentive structure is required to make both the business units and the management better off. The thesis also analyses the circumstances and necessary prerequisites under which <b>cross</b> <b>selling</b> initiatives are beneficial for all involved parties. Apart from that <b>cross</b> <b>selling</b> sometimes {{may turn out to be}} non-beneficial. In addition to the elaborations above, risks and hazards of <b>cross</b> <b>selling</b> are presented in detail and applied for the extension of the underlying model. Bottom line, the work underlines that <b>cross</b> <b>selling</b> is to be realized holistically to ensure durable success. (author's abstract) ...|$|E

To diversify their business, mobile operators are {{moving away from}} traditional voice communication to mobile value-added services (VAS), which are new services to generate more {{average revenue per user}} (ARPU). Therefore, it is important to find the relationship between some products in order to sell appropriate products or services to appropriate customers at an appropriate time. This is why cross-selling is critical for mobile telecom operators to expand their revenue and profit. In this study, we investigate the application of a Service Oriented Business Intelligence (SOBI) architecture by aggregating subscriber usage data from multiple sources, including transactional call data records (CDR), recharge records, billing systems and VAS service usage records towards helping operators to identify a wide range of service usage patterns of Telecoms operations.
