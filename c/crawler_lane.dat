5000|$|A {{climbing}} lane, truck lane, or <b>crawler</b> <b>lane</b> {{is often}} provided on steep mountain grades, {{in order to}} allow smaller vehicles to pass larger, slower ones. The lane is marked only on the uphill stretch and usually a short distance afterward (for regaining speed).|$|E
50|$|The {{project was}} to build a 3.75 mi single {{carriageway}} road, with <b>crawler</b> <b>lane</b> along part, linking the A354 Manor Roundabout near Radipole to the A354 {{at the top of}} the Ridgeway Hill.The main carriageway of the Weymouth Relief Road opened on Thursday 17 March 2011.|$|E
50|$|The tunnel carries three {{lanes of}} traffic, {{allowing}} for a <b>crawler</b> <b>lane</b> on each exit gradient. Prior to construction the average daily traffic through the Eiksund Tunnel was projected to be 1,000 vehicles per day (vpd). The ease of crossing the fjord, however, rapidly increased traffic to 2200 vpd. When the tunnel was fully financed after six years and became toll free, traffic jumped again to 2880 vpd.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{part of the}} {{originally}} planned [...] "M67" [...] exists in South Yorkshire, as the A616 Stocksbridge bypass which opened in 1989. As there was no certainty that the whole M67 scheme would be completed by this time, the then government decided that the scheme would not be built with motorway characteristics, but as a single carriageway with <b>crawler</b> <b>lanes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{motorway}} then descends steeply {{into the}} northern suburbs {{of the former}} North Shore City, the northern of Auckland's four former cities. <b>Crawler</b> <b>lanes</b> are provided for heavy vehicles between Oteha Valley Road and Greville Road. The Greville Road interchange was until 1999 the northern terminus, with the current northbound entrance and exit ramps following the old formation down to the roundabout intersection with Albany Highway.|$|R
5000|$|On major routes, such as {{motorways}} in the UK, {{the climbing}} lane is {{also referred to}} as a <b>crawler</b> <b>lane.</b> A variation that has become common with newer roads and more recent widening schemes is to add an additional [...] "fast" [...] (passing) lane for the stretch which otherwise would have had a <b>crawler</b> <b>lane.</b> This allows underpowered vehicles to remain in the existing [...] "slow" [...] lane without having to purposely pull left into the [...] "slow" [...] lane (which some drivers may not do because of pride or ignorance - particularly tow-car drivers assuming it is a [...] "truck only" [...] lane), or having to try to merge back into faster traffic (possibly still at low speed) when it ends. Instead, the more normal requirement to purposely pull out to pass slower vehicles, and back in after doing so or when the lane ends, generally with a smaller speed differential (as they will be rejoining what is already a passing lane), is placed on faster drivers.|$|E
50|$|The major {{bottleneck}} in Swindon at Blunsdon {{traffic lights}} and the nearby Turnpike roundabout, where local traffic mixes with through traffic for the M4 and the Cotswolds has recently been addressed. Construction of a bypass at Blunsdon commenced on 13 September 2006, and was fully completed in February 2009, although the new dual two-lane carriageway (with an additional <b>crawler</b> <b>lane</b> going southbound up Blunsdon hill) was open by January 2009. A flyover at Commonhead, the main junction for southeast Swindon and another notorious source of congestion, was opened to traffic on 6 February 2007.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} terminus is a roundabout on Ferry Road, a {{few hundred}} metres southeast of an intersection with the Christchurch ring route. The motorway immediately crosses the Heathcote river and is carried on an embankment south across its swampy floodplain. The northern section is two lane, unlit and is relatively lightly trafficked, {{with the majority of}} traffic entering at a grade-separated parclo interchange with Port Hills Road which connects via the Opawa Expressway to the north and west.South of the interchange the motorway climbs the western side of the Heathcote Valley, with a <b>crawler</b> <b>lane</b> and passing though some cuttings. The access road to Horotane valley, a side valley of the Heathcote, passes beneath the motorway, connecting to Port Hills Road which continues in parallel to the motorway.|$|E
50|$|The Elton Bypass {{takes the}} A605 onto a new more southerly route {{to join the}} A1(M) at its {{northern}} terminus at Junction 17. This route then overlaps the A1 for 1 mi to Alwalton where it regains its original route, heading northeast through Orton towards Peterborough. The bypassed section from Elton to Orton suffered from poor alignment {{and is now the}} B671 and a C road. The Elton Bypass climbs two hills and benefits from <b>crawler</b> <b>lanes</b> on both sections from both east and west.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the road}} was opened, there have been various {{improvements}} carried out to meet the increasing traffic demand, such as the addition of uphill <b>crawler</b> <b>lanes</b> (Tsuen Wan Bound) at Sam Shing Hui, So Kwun Wat, Tai Lam Chung and Ting Kau. The Highways Department has plans to carry out extensive reconstruction works on Tuen Mun Road that will include widening traffic lanes, improving horizontal curvatures and sightlines, and the installation of noise barriers. These works commenced in October 2008 and completed {{at the end of}} 2015.|$|R
25|$|SH 1 has varied road conditions. For most of {{its length}} it is a two-lane single {{carriageway}} road with at-grade intersections and access, sealed with chipseal in rural areas or asphalt in urban and high-traffic areas. The highway has frequent passing lanes on these sections, to allow traffic to pass other vehicles safely. Parts of the road are steep by international standards. Most steep sections having a combination of passing <b>lanes</b> (uphill), and <b>crawler</b> <b>lanes</b> or stopping bays (downhill) to allow heavy and slow vehicles {{to pull out of}} the way to let other vehicles pass.|$|R
50|$|The A55 {{begins at}} the end of the M53 {{motorway}} near Chester, where it is known as the Chester Southerly Bypass, crossing the River Dee and the Welsh border before passing close to Broughton then passing north of Buckley , Penyffordd and Northop. There is a major climb westbound between Broughton and Buckley (Junctions 35a to 35) though with no <b>crawler</b> <b>lane.</b> Junction 34/33b is point at which the A494 converges and then diverges with the A55. The road briefly has a three-lane section as westbound traffic from Queensferry can leave towards Mold. In the eastbound direction another short three-lane section allows vehicles to join the A494 or exit onto the A55 to Chester. Traffic taking the A55 into England must negotiate a tight 270 degree speed-limited single lane curve to climb up and over the A55/A494. Plans to upgrade the A494 between this junction at Ewloe and Queensferry were rejected by the Welsh Assembly Government on 26 March 2008 due to their scale.|$|E
50|$|From Ewloe, {{the road}} is {{relatively}} flat until after Northop when it climbs up onto the flanks of Halkyn Mountain range, passing to the southwest of Holywell with major climbs between Northop and Halkyn (Junctions 33 and 32b) and Halkyn and Holywell Summit (Junctions 32 and 31). This section of road is notorious for poor weather conditions including fog, ice and snow in winter months. In fine weather, however there are extensive views over the River Dee estuary to the Wirral Peninsula, Liverpool and beyond. The highest part of {{the road is}} {{in the vicinity of}} Brynford at around 790 feet (240 m). The steep descent towards St Asaph is down the new Rhuallt Hill (Junctions 29 to 28), which also provides the first views of the mountains of Snowdonia in the far distance. There is a <b>crawler</b> <b>lane</b> on Rhuallt Hill for eastbound traffic. The road bypasses St Asaph to the north, and runs past Bodelwyddan and Abergele to reach the North Wales coast at Pensarn (Junction 23A). From here onwards to Bangor, the route is close to the North Wales Coast railway.|$|E
50|$|It {{passes the}} former site of Manton Colliery, {{and a large}} B & Q depot on the left. There is a {{roundabout}} with the B6040 (former route through Worksop), which has access to Manton Wood Enterprise Zone. It passes a large Wilkos depot {{on the left and}} goes through Clumber Park. It meets the A1 at the Apleyhead Junction, with the A614, also known as Five Lanes End. The former roundabout was grade-separated in November 2007. Via the A1, it passes Elkesley (on the former route) with two 50 mph speed cameras and the Retford Gamston Airport, where it crosses the River Idle. Prior to the A1(M) Doncaster bypass opening in August 1961, this section of the road was the A57 - the A1 (now A638) went straight through Retford. Near to West Drayton it crosses the River Maun; this section shared with the A1 was dualled in the late 1950s, and the West Drayton Diversion was a completely new section, with the bridge over the Maun and Markham Moor roundabout, and opened in February 1957. At the next roundabout with the A638 (for Retford) and B1164 (for West Markham) at Markham Moor (again being grade-separated) there is the Markham Hotel and two Little Chefs, including one (originally a petrol station) designed by Sam Scorer with a hyperbolic paraboloid-shaped roof that was threatened with demolition but was listed by the Department for Culture Media and Sport in 2012. The Markham Hotel is currently situated on the former pre-1957 route, 330 yards to the north, and there are two large Markham Moor Shell stations. It leaves up the steep Cliff Gate to the left, which now has a <b>crawler</b> <b>lane</b> over Beacon Hill. It bypasses East Markham (on the former route to the south), and crosses the East Coast Main Line. 550 yards east of the village it resumes its former route. It meets the A6075 (for Tuxford and Ollerton) from the right west of Darlton where it passes St Giles' Church. There are turns for East Drayton to the left and Ragnall on the right, and the power stations of Cottam and (former) High Marnham are to the north and south, with many lines of pylons following the Trent.|$|E
50|$|The Welsh Government has {{constructed}} a bypass to reduce traffic congestion on the A473 road at Tonteg, Church Village (Pentre'r Eglwys) and Llantwit Fardre. The Church Village bypass, {{as it is}} known, has been built as a single carriageway, with <b>crawler</b> and overtaking <b>lanes</b> around roundabouts, and was opened for traffic in September 2010.|$|R
50|$|Costain, under {{contract}} from Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council constructed a bypass to reduce traffic congestion on the A473, Pontypridd to Bridgend (Penybont) road, from Cross Inn, near Llantrisant, to Tonteg via Efail Isaf. The Church Village bypass, which is {{built as a}} single carriageway, with <b>crawler</b> and overtaking <b>lanes</b> around roundabouts opened in September 2010.|$|R

2500|$|Subsequently the Lands and Survey Department {{disposed}} {{of much of}} the Rail corridor land to adjoining land owners through the early 1970s, although current title searches still reveal in nearly all cases the former route of the line to this day. Looking at Google Earth in 2007 one can easily trace the line through the countryside by zooming in, seeing cuttings, formations and even some railway building structures. For a while in 1968/1969 there was a suggestion of using the old Big Hill rail tunnel, south of Beaumont, as a bypass over Big Hill for heavy trucks. The one lane nature of the tunnel and its restrictive height meant that the high stock transporting trucks of the era would be unable to use it so it effectively the idea foundered and the tunnel was never used again. However, as described below there is hope that this tunnel may see use again – at least as part of a proposed rail trail.(NOTE Sept 18, 2013 - this has come to fruition and the old tunnel has been tidied up and is now officially part of the Roxburgh Hydro to Lawrence Clutha Gold cycling/walking trail, to be opened Oct 2013). Other parts of the line though were investigated for use also by the Ministry Of Works, the National Road Board and the Tuapeka County Council. This included potentially a suggestion of re-diverting SH8 up {{the east side of the}} Clutha River to Millers Flat, general road easements/realignments at old level crossings and the installation of <b>crawler</b> <b>lanes</b> for heavy truck vehicles. [...] Some of these came to fruition but it was not until 2000 that the old formation up the Beaumont Gorge was turned into a minor public road, the Millennium track, which may form part of a future rail trail on the Roxburgh Branch.|$|R
5000|$|Preparatory work on {{the bypass}} began in February 2008, and the bypass opened on 7 September 2010 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-11205244. It is a single carriageway, with <b>crawler</b> and {{overtaking}} <b>lanes</b> around roundabouts. As {{the result of this}} completion the existing A473 from Gwaun Meisgyn to Treforest route was downgraded to the B4595 meaning that [...] "Power Station hill" [...] became part of the A473 Pontypridd to Bridgend route which also meant that the A473 now starts at the A470 junction at Upper Boat rather than Treforest. It also meant that the A4058 in Treforest and Glyn Taff became part of the B4595 Treforest to Talbot Green route meaning that the A4058 will start from the junction at the A470 in Pontypridd and follows its usual route to Treorchy. https://web.archive.org/web/20110207104351/http://churchvillagebypass.com/route%20reclassification.pdf ...|$|R
40|$|Compared to {{traditional}} plowing and minimum tillage, the sod seeding technique {{has been tested}} in order to evaluate the differences in energy consumption, labor and machinery requirement and CO 2 emission reduction. The experiments were conducted on winter cereal seeding in a Po valley farm in October 2011. The tests were carried out as follows: wheat variety seeding, over corn and alfalfa crops, in large plots with three repetitions for each thesis. They included: sod seeding anticipated by round up weeding {{in the case of}} the plots over alfalfa; traditional plowing at 35 cm followed by rotary tillage and combined seeding (seeder plus rotary tiller); minimum tillage based on ripping at the same depth (35 cm) and combined seeder (seeder plus rotary tiller). The following farm operations - fertilizer, and other agrochemical distributionshave been the same in all the considered theses. The results, statistically significant (P< 0. 001) in terms of yields, highlighted slight differences: the best data {{in the case of the}} traditional plowing both in the case of wheat crop over corn and alfalfa (84. 43 and 6. 75 t/ha); slightly lower yields for the sod seeding (6. 23 and 79. 9 t/ha for corn and alfalfa respectively); lower in the case of minimum tillage (5. 87; 79. 77 t/ha in the two situations). Huge differences in energy and oil consumption have been recorded: in the case of succession to corn 61. 47; 35. 31; 4. 27 kg oil/ha respectively for, traditional plowing, minimum tillage and sod seeding; in the case of alfalfa 61. 2; 50. 96; 5. 14 kg oil/ha respectively for traditional plowing, minimum tillage and sod seeding. The innovative technique, highlighted huge energy saving with an oil consumption equal to 92 % and 89 % (P< 0. 001) of what happens in traditional plowing and minimum tillage. Large differences concern labor and machine productivity. These parameters together with oil consumption and machine size [power (kW) and weight (t) ] lead to even greater differences in terms of energy consumption, efficiency and CO 2 emission savings. Considerations related to the different mechanizations chains, investments required and to some new practices to be introduced, such as low pressure tires or <b>crawlers,</b> ideal <b>lanes,</b> GPS and automatic guide systems to follow the ideal lanes, conclude the study...|$|R
