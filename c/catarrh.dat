25|$|Galen {{notes that}} the {{exanthem}}a covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby {{where there was no}} ulceration. He states that those that were going to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually {{in the form of a}} blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one Thucydides described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, <b>catarrh,</b> cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.|$|E

25|$|In 1851, Sarah and James Durno {{moved to}} Albany, New York and began their {{practice}} as homeopathic physicians. At that time, homeopathic health care {{was a new}} field of medicine, which used herbs and medicines rather than the traditional procedures performed by doctors at the time – bleeding patients, or “purging” the body through vomiting. Their practice specialized in providing medical care for women and children. The price of their services was “to the rich, one dollar – to the poor gratis ”. The Durnos began manufacturing herbal medicines and Durno <b>Catarrh</b> Snuff. By 1867, the couple had moved their manufacturing company to New York and lived in a large brick house in Brooklyn Heights. On June 22, 1871, James Durno died in Brooklyn, Kings County (not yet part of New York City), aged 76, and was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery.

The next morning, he goes to the market square to observe the body language of Prince Aderopo, who suspiciously stares at him in confidence and even winks at him that {{there is no evidence to}} prove he indeed killed the girls. Danladi visits Tawa in the school she works as a teacher, in order to question her about the relationship she has with the Prince. Danladi discovers that Aderopo and Agbekoya are both recipients of a scholarship from a Reverend Father in the town, Father Dowling (Colin David Reese). Danladi visits Agbekoya, who reveals to him that they were constantly molested by the Reverend Father in Lagos city. At a celebration on the eve of Independence, Prince Aderopo invites Tawa to their childhood hideout, which has been renovated. Danladi and Afonja try to trail them, but are unsuccessful; Agbekoya, the only other person who knows the location of the hideout, leads them to it. On getting there, Aderopo is about to make Tawa his sixth victim, representing the end of the six years of violation he received from the Reverend Father. Tawa is saved.|$|E

The moonlight fubbed the girandoles. And the cold dresses that they wore, In the vapid haze of the window-bays, Were tranquil As they leaned and looked From the window-sills at the alphabets, At beta b and gamma g, To study The canting curlicues Of heaven {{and of the}} heavenly script. And there they read of marriage-bed. Ti-lill-o! And they read right long. The gaunt guitarists on the strings Rumbled a-day and a-day, a-day. The moonlight Rose on the beachy floors. How explicit the coiffures became, The diamond point, the sapphire point, The sequins Of the civil fans! Insinuations of desire, Puissant speech, alike in each, Cried quittance To the wickless halls. Then from their poverty they rose, From dry guitars, and to <b>catarrhs</b> They flitted Through the palace walls.
