25|$|Additionally, {{many such}} floors are multipurpose. For instance, a {{community}} hall {{might be used}} for play groups and old-age groups, for dances, aerobics and sports, and for seating for plays. The floor may have to support heavy objects like pianos. There may also be requirements for ease of <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Cost of repair after damage by vandals or stiletto heels is also a consideration. Note that the necessity to serve multiple purposes can often be eased {{by the use of}} a gym floor cover to protect the floor.|$|E
25|$|Physical hazards affect {{many people}} in the workplace. Occupational hearing loss is the most common work-related injury in the United States, with 22 million workers exposed to {{hazardous}} noise levels at work and an estimated $242 million spent annually on worker's compensation for hearing loss disability. Falls are also a common cause of occupational injuries and fatalities, especially in construction, extraction, transportation, healthcare, and building <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Machines have moving parts, sharp edges, hot surfaces and other hazards with the potential to crush, burn, cut, shear, stab or otherwise strike or wound workers if used unsafely.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, {{the current}} form of Parish Pastoral Council was launched, {{succeeding}} an older group which had launched many parish projects; {{it has the}} two clergy, 5 appointed members and 7 nominated from among parishioners.

2500|$|Bellows-driven {{instruments}} – {{such as the}} accordion, concertina, melodeon and (Irish) Uilleann bagpipes – reportedly need {{less frequent}} <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{as a result of}} the Irish smoke-free law. [...] "Third-hand smoke", solid particulates from secondhand smoke that are adsorbed onto surfaces and later re-emitted as gases or transferred through touch, are a particular problem for musicians. [...] After playing in smoky bars, instruments can emit nicotine, 3-ethenylpyridine (3-EP), phenol, cresols, naphthalene, formaldehyde, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (including some not found in freshly emitted tobacco smoke), which can enter musicians' bodies through the skin, or be re-emitted as gases after they have left the smoky environment. Concern about third-hand smoke on instruments is one of the reasons many musicians, represented by the New Orleans Musicians' Clinic, supported the smoking ban there.|$|E

2500|$|After {{their father}} gained {{employment}} as the Midlands area {{manager of a}} <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> business, P-Orridge {{was sent to the}} privately run Solihull School in Warwickshire from 1964 through to 1968; a period they would refer to as [...] "basically four years of being mentally and physically tortured", but also a time when they developed an interest in art, occultism and the avant-garde. Unpopular with other students, P-Orridge was bullied at the school, finding comfort in the art department at lunch-time and in the evenings. They befriended Ian [...] "Spydeee" [...] Evetts, Barry [...] "Little Baz" [...] Hermon and Paul Wolfson, three fellow students who shared their interest in art, literature and poetry. They regularly discussed books and music, developing an interest in the writings of Aleister Crowley, William S Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg and the music of Frank Zappa, The Fugs and The Velvet Underground. P-Orridge became interested in occultism, and has also asserted that their grandmother was a medium.|$|E
2500|$|Dimension stone {{requires}} some specialized methods for <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance.</b> [...] Abrasive cleaners {{should not be}} used on a polished stone finish because it will wear the polish off. [...] Acidic cleaners can not be used on marble or limestone because it will remove (i.e. dissolve) the finish. [...] Textured finishes (thermal, bush-hammered) can be treated with some mildly abrasive cleaners but not bleach or an acidic cleaner (if marble or limestone). [...] Stains are another consideration; stains can be organic (food, grease, or oil) or metallic (iron, copper). [...] Stains require some special removal techniques, such as the poultice method. [...] A new method of cleaning stone on ancient buildings (medieval and renaissance) has been developed in Europe: sulfur-reducing bacteria are used on the black gypsum-containing crusts that form on such buildings to convert the sulfur to a gas that dissipates, thus destroying the crust while leaving the patina produced by aging on the underlying stone. [...] This method is still in development and not yet commercially available.|$|E
2500|$|Distress is a {{prevalent}} {{and costly}} problem in today's workplace. About one-third of workers report {{high levels of}} stress. 20-30% of workers in different sectors of the European Union reported in 2007 that they believed work-related stress was potentially affecting their health. Three-quarters of employees believe the worker has more on-the-job stress than a generation ago. In Great Britain, a sixth of the workforce experiences occupational stress every year. Evidence also suggests that distress is the major cause of turnover in organizations. With continued distress at the workplace, workers will develop psychological and physiological dysfunctions and decreased motivation in excelling in their position. [...] Increased levels of job stress {{are determined by the}} awareness of having little control but lots of demands in the work area. Occupational stress and its sequelae represent the majority of work-related illnesses causing missed work days. Those in the protective services, transportation and materials moving, building grounds <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and healthcare are more susceptible to both work injuries and illnesses, as well as work-related stress.|$|E

2500|$|Titanium dioxide dust, when inhaled, {{has been}} {{classified}} by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen, meaning it is possibly carcinogenic to humans. The {{findings of the}} IARC {{are based on the}} discovery that high concentrations of pigment-grade (powdered) and ultrafine titanium dioxide dust caused respiratory tract cancer in rats exposed by inhalation and intratracheal instillation. The series of biological events or steps that produce the rat lung cancers (e.g. particle deposition, impaired lung clearance, cell injury, fibrosis, mutations and ultimately cancer) have also been seen in people working in dusty environments. Therefore, the observations of cancer in animals were considered, by IARC, as relevant to people doing jobs with exposures to titanium dioxide dust. For example, titanium dioxide production workers may be exposed to high dust concentrations during packing, milling, site <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance,</b> if there are insufficient dust control measures in place. However, the human studies conducted so far do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide and an increased risk for cancer. The safety of the use of nano-particle sized titanium dioxide, which can penetrate the body and reach internal organs, has been criticized. Studies have also found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles cause inflammatory response and genetic damage in mice. The mechanism by which [...] may cause cancer is unclear. Molecular research suggests that cell cytotoxicity due to [...] results from the interaction between [...] nanoparticles and the lysosomal compartment, independently of the known apoptotic signalling pathways.|$|E
