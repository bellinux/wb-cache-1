The {{improved}} fries were {{coated with}} a layer of potato-based starch, giving the fries a crisp shell that maintained its texture longer. The company introduced them in a series of advertisements that claimed the new fries tasted better than McDonald's fries in <b>consumer</b> <b>taste</b> comparisons. Other ads featured Mr. Potato Head in a series of demographically-targeted commercials. The fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato wedges, a type of French fry that is thick-cut and wedge-shaped. In 1991, the company introduced Twister fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal was they were served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry carton. The product was designed as a short-term promotion that would be periodically reintroduced.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Carl Bridenbaugh {{examined}} in depth five key cities: Boston (population 16,000 in 1760), Newport Rhode Island (population 7500), New York City (population 18,000), Philadelphia (population 23,000), and Charles Town (Charlestown, South Carolina), (population 8000). He argues they grew from small villages to take major leadership roles in promoting trade, land speculation, immigration, and prosperity, and in disseminating {{the ideas of}} the Enlightenment, and new methods in medicine and technology. Furthermore, they sponsored a <b>consumer</b> <b>taste</b> for English amenities, developed a distinctly American educational system, and began systems for care of people meeting welfare. The cities were not remarkable by European standards, but they did display certain distinctly American characteristics, according to Bridenbaugh. There was no aristocracy or established church, there was no long tradition of powerful guilds. The colonial governments were much less powerful and intrusive than corresponding national governments in Europe. They experimented with new methods to raise revenue, build infrastructure, and solve urban problems. They were more democratic than European cities, in that a large fraction of the men could vote, and class lines were more fluid. Contrasted to Europe, printers (especially as newspaper editors) had a much larger role in shaping public opinion, and lawyers moved easily back and forth between politics and their profession. Bridenbaugh argues that by the mid-18th century, the middle-class businessmen, professionals, and skilled artisans dominated the cities. He characterizes them as [...] "sensible, shrewd, frugal, ostentatiously moral, generally honest," [...] public spirited, and upwardly mobile, and argues their economic strivings led to [...] "democratic yearnings" [...] for political power.|$|E

We find equilibria of the pure location and of the price-location games and show what changes when we move from a duopoly of profit maximizing producers to a mixed duopoly.

50|$|Normal value {{cannot be}} based on the price in the exporter’s {{domestic}} market when there are no domestic sales. For example, if the products are only sold on the foreign market, the normal value will have to be determined on another basis. Additionally, some products may be sold on both markets but the quantity sold on the domestic market may be small compared to quantity sold on foreign market. This situation happens often in countries with small domestic markets like Hong Kong and Singapore, though similar circumstances may also happen in larger markets. This is because of differences in factors like <b>consumer</b> <b>taste</b> and maintenance.|$|E

50|$|Packing {{methods and}} meat grading {{could not be}} {{included}} in the archaeological investigation because samples of meat included in the investigation were highly disturbed, meaning they were not in situ {{at the time of their}} recovery. Conservation restraints made the excavation of intact casks too costly, however, analysis of both beef and pork carcasses artefacts recovered from William Salthouse found that these examples of imported salted meats would be indistinguishable from Australian terrestrial sites in Australia due to commonalities in butchering techniques. Similarities between the butcher marks on both ribs and vertebrae recovered from the wreck and Australian butchered meats from the First Government House make the cuts of meat indistinguishable. This similarity merits further consideration, since the square cutting of beef samples shows a high degree of similarity. Butchering practices are further complicated by factors such as type of carcase, quality, meat bearing capacity, <b>consumer</b> <b>taste,</b> economic climate and the source of trade training. The range of external factors that impact use of meat type require investigations to address the relationship of site occupants to forms of supply, and the butchering mark morphology and frequency.|$|E

40|$|How {{should a}} firm modify its product {{assortment}} over time when learning about <b>consumer</b> <b>tastes?</b> In this paper, we study dynamic assortment decisions in a horizontally differentiated product category for which consumers' diverse tastes {{can be represented}} as locations on a Hotelling line. We presume that the firm knows all possible consumer locations, comprising a finite set, but does not know their probability distribution. We model this problem as a discrete-time dynamic program; each period, the firm chooses an assortment and sets prices to maximize the total expected profit over a finite horizon, given its subjective beliefs over <b>consumer</b> <b>tastes.</b> The <b>consumers</b> then choose a product from the assortment that maximizes their own utility. The firm observes sales, which provide censored information on <b>consumer</b> <b>tastes,</b> and it updates beliefs in a Bayesian fashion. There is a recurring trade-off between the immediate profits from sales {{in the current period}} (exploitation) and the informational gains to be exploited in all future periods (exploration). We show that one can (partially) order assortments based on their information content and that in any given period the optimal assortment cannot be less informative than the myopically optimal assortment. This result is akin to the well-known 2 ̆ 2 stock more 2 ̆ 2 result in censored newsvendor problems with the newsvendor learning about demand through sales when lost sales are not observable. We demonstrate that it can be optimal for the firm to alternate between exploration and exploitation, and even offer assortments that lead to losses in the current period in order to gain information on <b>consumer</b> <b>tastes.</b> We also develop a Bayesian conjugate model that reduces the state space of the dynamic program and study value of learning using this conjugate model...|$|R

50|$|The {{next big}} export product {{came in the}} form of Cyprus Sherry. It was first marketed by that name in 1937 and was {{exported}} mainly to northern Europe. By the 1960s, Britain was consuming 13.6 million litres of Cyprus wines, half the island's production, mostly as sweet sherry. A British market research study of fortified wines in 1978 showed Emva cream was the leading Cyprus sherry in terms of brand recognition, and second in that market only to Harveys' Bristol Cream.The island became the UK's third leading wine supplier behind France and Spain. A major factor was that Cyprus Sherry was more affordable than Spanish Sherry as British taxation favoured alcoholic beverages with an alcoholic content below the 15.5-18 percent bracket. This competitive advantage was lost a few years later with the re-banding of the alcohol content taxation. The fortified wine market also began to shrink as a whole due to a change in <b>consumer</b> <b>taste</b> and as a result Cyprus sherry sales in the UK fell from their peak in the early 1970s by some 65 percent by the mid 1980s. The final blow came when the EC ruled that as of January 1996 only fortified wine from Jerez could assume the title of sherry.|$|E

40|$|The beef {{industry}} has experienced major changes {{during the past}} 25 years, highlighted by steadily decreasing per-capita beef consumption. Changing <b>consumer</b> <b>tastes</b> and preferences have spurred the need for product differentiation in the beef indus-try, pressing producers to utilize alternative mar-keting methods for their beef products (Purcell; Givry). One alternative for beef producers is the natural (no hormones or antibiotics) beef market. The natural beef market is growing, with the great-est growth occurring on the coasts, and more pro-ducers of natural beef are emerging. Recent work by Lusk and Fox indicates that consumers are will-ing to pay a higher price for quality-differentiated beef products to offset the increased production costs for natural beef producers.
