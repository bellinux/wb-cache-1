50|$|Prospects for Galician {{self-government}} {{and possible}} restoration of a Xunta came close while the Galician Statute of Autonomy of 1936 was being discussed, {{at the time}} of the Spanish Second Republic (1931-1939). However, the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) and subsequent Francoist dictatorship (1939-1977) halted the process.

40|$|Santiago de Compostela {{has been}} a pilgrimage site for centuries. It was founded due to the {{discovery}} of the tomb of St. James (Santiago), whose remains are said to lie inside the city’s famous cathedral. Compostela is, nonetheless, a modest city of around 100, 000 inhabitants, with a small but consolidated historic centre, and is the cultural and political centre of Galicia. It is the capital of the autonomic community of northwest Spain. With the objective of projecting Galicia as a centre of culture and knowledge on the world stage, the Xunta de Galicia (<b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galicia)</b> approved the construction of a monumental building complex over the top of Monte Gaiás, a hill that dominates Santiago and its surrounding topography. Construction began in 2001, supervised by architect Peter Eisenman, and the structure is still incomplete. The project has provoked a great deal of controversy, transcending all sectors of Gallegan and Spanish society. It has become an enormous expenditure for a Gallegan economy that {{is still one of the}} most traditional and modest in Spain. The controversy is especially sensitive given that Spain is already enduring a profound economic crisis. Critics say the project lacks clear purpose, without a sense of mission for the uses of the new buildings. This is especially so when contrasted to the historic centre of the city, a complete success in terms of public space habitability and economic solvency (due to tourism). One can only ask: Why, in front of such an exemplary model of small-scale, high-impact development, promoting long-term, ‘small-dose’ growth, is a complex built that opposes all the values of the community and city it represents? Haven’t the Gallegans learnt from their millenary past and their strong cultural heritage? It is becoming more evident, with time, that the City of Culture (Ciudad de la Cultura), the new development, is an example of what should not be done in the fields of urban and social development, at least in the context into which it has been inserted...|$|E

40|$|The {{specific}} granaries called hórreos {{are a very}} characteristic {{element of}} the northernmost and wet areas of the Iberian Peninsula, and in particular of the Spanish region called Galicia. They are in fact an outstanding architectural rural element of the Galician popular cultural heritage, with a social prestige surpassing their utility as simple maize granaries. Braña Rey & Ulla Miguel started in 2013 a multidisciplinary study in cultural astronomy of a sample of hórreos located in the two parishes of Cobres, in the <b>council</b> <b>of</b> Vilaboa (<b>Galicia),</b> on which {{a significant number of}} astronomy-related decorative motifs of iconographic importance was found worth studying. As popular constructions of very high social meaning, they still keep their importance as a symbolic and identity referent for the Galician society as a whole. It is, then, crucial to consider the spatial context in relation to their traditional and current uses {{when it comes to their}} study and hórreos can be used as a key educational resource for various purposes. In this regard, the present collaboration deals with an educational project developed to study a sample of hórreos in the parish <b>of</b> Beade (<b>council</b> <b>of</b> Vigo) by a group of 20 students between 15 and 17 years old. No astral motifs were expected to be found in the area, but the sole application of the scientific method to a research project tackled by High School pupils on their own was found most interesting analysing, together with all the educational aspects to be derived from the project development itself. For this still ongoing work, a summary of preliminary results can be presented for the Beade sample in three main aspects: ethnography, orientations and education. When appropriate, some comparisons with the data previously obtained for the hórreos of Cobres will also be addressed...|$|R
