5000|$|In Australia, {{the term}} swag is still widely {{used to refer}} to a tent or other {{portable}} shelter used for <b>camping</b> <b>or</b> <b>outdoor</b> sleeping. [...] A modern swag is a waterproof canvas sleeping compartment that is sometimes insect-proof. All swags come with a foam mattress, and can comfortably be slept in {{with the addition of a}} pillow and sleeping bag. When rolled up the swag is relatively lightweight and compact, making it ideal for storage and transport. It is typically easy to erect, and roll up can be done quickly. Swags are still heavily used in Australia, by overlanders. There are still a large number of manufacturers actively making both standard and custom-design swags. The modern swag is designed for robustness and is marketed towards those travelling by vehicle [...] - [...] they are too heavy and bulky to be transported long distances on foot. Bushwalkers and hikers would use conventional lightweight tents and sleeping bags. More recently, several camping supply firms have produced readymade bedrolls along the pattern of the original swag, and refer to these as [...] "swags".|$|R
5000|$|The outdoor {{wood boiler}} is a variant on the indoor wood, oil or gas boiler. An <b>outdoor</b> wood boiler <b>or</b> <b>outdoor</b> wood <b>stove</b> is a unit about 4-6 {{feet wide and}} around 10 feet long. It {{is made up of}} three main parts, the firebox, which can be either round or square, the water jacket, and the exhaust heat {{reclaiming}} system. The fire box ranges from 2 to 5 feet long and can be as tall as 4 feet. It is fit lengthwise inside the outer shell and is surrounded by the water jacket. The water Jacket is a second shell around the fire box which is filled with water, which is circulated through insulated underground lines to the house, where the heat can be transferred from the water to the existing heating system. After the wood is burned, the smoke is passed through the water jacket to reclaim much of the heat in the exhaust.|$|R

40|$|First {{published}} online 23 June 2016 Epidemiological studies use georeferenced health data {{to identify}} disease clusters but {{the accuracy of}} this georeferencing is obfuscated by incorrectly assigning the source of infection and by aggregating case data to larger geographical areas. Often, place of residence (residence) {{is used as a}} proxy for the source of infection (source) which may not be accurate. Using a 21 -year dataset from South Australia of human infections with the mosquito-borne Ross River virus, we found that 37 % of cases were believed to have been acquired away from home. We constructed two risk maps using age-standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) calculated using residence and patient-reported source. Both maps confirm significant inter-suburb variation in SMRs. Areas frequently named as the source (but not residence) and the highest-risk suburbs both tend to be tourist locations with vector mosquito habitat, and <b>camping</b> <b>or</b> <b>outdoor</b> recreational opportunities. We suggest the highest-risk suburbs as places to focus on for disease control measures. We also use a novel application of ambient population data (LandScan) to improve the interpretation of these risk maps and propose how this approach can aid in implementing disease abatement measures on a smaller scale than for which disease data are available.

5000|$|A basic {{requirement}} of a Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) event {{is that everyone}} wear clothing similar to that worn before 1601 AD. [...] Within the SCA, the term {{for this type of}} period clothing is [...] "garb", and there can be a very wide range in the time period, style and level of authenticity. Members often have [...] "field" [...] garb, simple cotton tunics or gowns that they wear to <b>camping</b> <b>or</b> other <b>outdoor</b> events, and [...] "court" [...] garb made of expensive brocades and silks that are reserved for formal events. Many SCA members make their own clothing, but can also purchase their garb from merchants or barter with other SCA members. Newcomers to the SCA can usually borrow garb for their first event or two by contacting the local group's Gold Key officer or Chatelaine/Castellan, who is responsible for helping acclimatize new members.|$|R
