25|$|The War Brides Act of 1945, and {{subsequent}} Alien Fiancées and Fiancés Act of 1946, allowed veterans, {{to return to}} the Philippines to bring back fiancées, wives, and children. In the years following the war, some sixteen thousand Filipinas entered the United States as war brides. That is not to say only women and children were beneficiaries of the acts for it was recorded that a lone Filipino groom immigrated during this period. These new immigrants enabled the formation of a second generation of Filipino Americans that grew the Filipino American communities, providing nuclear families. Immigration levels were impacted by the independence of the Philippines from the United States, that occurred on 4 July 1946. The quota of non-naval immigration increased slightly to 100 due to the passage of the Luce–Celler Act of 1946. Thus, Filipino American communities developed around United States Navy bases, whose impact can still be seen today. Filipino American communities were also settled near Army and Air Force bases. After World War II, until 1965, half of all Filipino immigrants to the United States were wives of U.S. servicemembers.
