Tadpoles spread quickly in isolated areas where fish do not have the time or access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found in the Everglades, and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Although <b>cleft</b> lip and palate (CLP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{congenital}} malformations, occurring in 1 in 700 live births, there is still no generally accepted treatment protocol. Numerous surgical techniques have been described for <b>cleft</b> palate repair; these techniques can be divided into one-stage (one operation) <b>cleft</b> palate repair and two-stage <b>cleft</b> palate closure. The aim of this study is to present our <b>cleft</b> palate team experience in using the two-stage <b>cleft</b> palate closure and the clinical outcomes in terms of oronasal fistula rate. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on medical records of 80 patients who underwent palate repair over a five-year period, from 2008 to 2012. All <b>cleft</b> palate patients were incorporated. Information on patient’s gender, <b>cleft</b> type, age at repair, one- or two-stage <b>cleft</b> palate repair were collected and analyzed. Results: Fifty-three (66 %) and twenty-seven (34 %) patients underwent two-stage and one-stage repair, respectively. According to Veau classification, more than 60 % of them were Veau III and IV, associating <b>cleft</b> lip to <b>cleft</b> palate. Fistula occurred in 34 % of the two-stage repairs versus 7 % of one-stage repairs, with an overall incidence of 24 %. Conclusions: Our study has shown that a two-stage <b>cleft</b> palate closure has a higher rate of fistula formation when compared with the one-stage repair. Two-stage repair is the protocol of choice in wide complete <b>cleft</b> lip and palate cases, while one-stage procedure is a good option for <b>cleft</b> palate alone, or some specific <b>cleft</b> lip and palate cases (narrow <b>cleft</b> palate, older age at surgery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the fibroblast phenotype of patients by analyzing gene and protein expression of <b>cleft</b> lip and/or <b>cleft</b> palate fibroblasts in relation to collagen turnover and extracellular matrix remodeling. Patients: Human palatal fibroblasts were obtained from three healthy subjects without <b>cleft</b> lip and/or <b>cleft</b> palate and from three subjects with nonsyndromic <b>cleft</b> lip and/or <b>cleft</b> palate. Collagen turnover-related gene and protein expression were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western and dot blots, and sodium dodecyl sulfate zymography. Results: <b>Cleft</b> lip and/or <b>cleft</b> palate fibroblasts, compared with controls, displayed a down-regulation of collagens type I and III messenger RNA (p <. 0001 and p <. 001, respectively) but an opposite tendency to increase protein levels. <b>Cleft</b> lip and/or <b>cleft</b> palate cells had higher lysyl hydroxylase- 2 b messenger RNA levels expressed in relation to collagen type I messenger RNA, down-regulated matrix metalloproteinase- 1, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase- 1, and Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine messenger RNA (p <. 0001 and p <. 01, respectively). Pro-matrix metalloproteinase- 1 tended to decrease, and pro-matrix metalloproteinase- 2 and - 9 were down-regulated (p <. 01, p <. 05, respectively), as was Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine protein expression (p <. 05). Conclusions: Our {{results suggest that the}} <b>cleft</b> lip and/or <b>cleft</b> palate fibroblast phenotype is characterized by a tendency toward interstitial collagen deposition due to posttranslational modifications, such as decreased collagen degradation by matrix metalloproteinases and increased collagen cross-links. These findings may contribute to the knowledge of the <b>cleft</b> lip and/or <b>cleft</b> palate fibroblast phenotype and may be useful to the surgeon when considering the potential wound contraction and subsequent undesired scarring in <b>cleft</b> lip and/or <b>cleft</b> palate ocurring after the surgical closure of a <b>cleft</b> palate...|$|R
