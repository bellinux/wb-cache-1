50|$|The Peninsular War was {{followed}} by the centralization of Spain (Constitutions of 1812, 1837, 1845, 1856, etc.), with only the Basque districts keeping a separate status until 1876. Compulsory education in 1856 made the use of Castilian (Spanish) mandatory, as well as discouraging and forbidding the use of other languages on a number social and institutional settings. Franco and his nationalist dictatorship imposed Spanish as the only valid language for any formal social interaction (1937). By the early 21st century, Spanish was the overwhelmingly dominant language in Spain, with Basque, Catalan, and Galician surviving and developing in their respective regions with different levels of recognition since 1980. Other minorized languages (Asturian, Aragonese) have also seen some recognition in the early 21st century. Catalan, sharing with Basque a strong link between language and identity, enjoys a fairly sound status. Basque <b>competence</b> <b>levels</b> have picked up during the last decades, but everyday use does not go up accordingly. Asturian has been classified by the Endangered Languages Project as being at risk, and Aragonese as an endangered language.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{consider}} the Peter principle and anti-Peter principle as the discrete logistic and discrete inverse logistic equation. Especially we discuss imprecisely estimated (by hierarchical control mechanism) carrying capacity, i. e. boundary (in) <b>competence</b> <b>level</b> of a hierarchy member. It implies that Peter principle holds two sub-principles. In the first one objective boundary <b>competence</b> <b>level</b> is increased for estimation error. In the second one objective boundary <b>competence</b> <b>level</b> is decreased for estimation error. Similarly, anti-Peter principle holds two sub-principles too. All this implies that paradoxical situations that follow from Peter and anti-Peter principle can be simply removed by decrease of the error of hierarchical (social) control. Also we discuss cases by Peter principle when error of the boundary <b>competence</b> <b>level</b> by estimation grows up. (Then, in fact, there is no estimation error but stimulation of the boundary level by control mechanism.) By first Peter subprinciple it implies anarchy in the social structure or, correspondingly, cancer in the biology and medicine, schizophrenia in the psychology and inflation in the economy. By second Peter sub-principle it implies a totalitary social structure (dictature or caste regime) or multiple...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the relationships between the emotional competence and task-contextual performance of employees. Data were gathered from 342 employees working in state and private banks. Relationships between the variables, significant relationships between the emotional competence dimensions and performance dimensions were observed in this study. No relationship was observed between the “guilty” dimension of emotional competence and task performance. Non-hierarchical cluster analysis was selected and K-means cluster analysis was performed to determine the emotional <b>competence</b> <b>levels</b> of participant banking professionals. The seven pre-specified emotional competences were classified by using Ward’s method. Cluster analysis revealed that the emotional competences of the participants were clustered in two groups as high and low. Regression analyses revealed insignificant relationships between the emotional competence and task performance of employees, but positive significant relationships between emotional competence and contextual performance. Significant differences were also observed in the emotional <b>competence</b> <b>levels</b> and task-contextual performances of employees. In other words, individuals with high emotional <b>competence</b> <b>levels</b> also exhibited high performances...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{objective of this}} article is to identify didactic practice and its <b>competence</b> <b>levels</b> and discuss possible differences and common traits within these <b>competence</b> <b>levels.</b> Furthermore, the paper seeks to develop an understanding of didactic practice which is led by an educational interest related to the learning of an unknown future or that which is unforeseen. In search for a framework of such a didactic practice one of the findings of the paper is that hermeneutics falls short as this theory mainly revolves around understanding. If we are to take questions of the unknown and unforeseen seriously, so we argue, there is a need for another didactic approach. We suggest that ironic questioning may be complicit. Irony is about concealing and withdrawal of knowledge, so as to creating space for silence, doubt and reflection. Thus we argue that the ironic questioning may emerge as a complement to different <b>competence</b> <b>levels</b> of didactic practice, including planning, conducting and evaluation of teaching, and discussion of teaching and curricula or research, towards renewed didactic theory...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundGoal-oriented {{communication}} of risk of hazards {{is necessary in}} order to reduce risk of workers' exposure to chemicals. Adequate training of workers and enterprise priority setting are essential elements. Cleaning enterprises have many challenges and the existing paradigms influence the risk levels of these enterprises. MethodsInformation on organization and enterprises' prioritization in training programs was gathered from cleaning enterprises. A measure of enterprises' conceptual level of importance of chemical health hazards and a model for working out the risk index (RI) indicating enterprises' conceptual risk level was established and used to categorize the enterprises. ResultsIn 72. 3 % of cases, training takes place concurrently with task performances and in 67. 4 % experienced workers conduct the trainings. There is disparity between employers' opinion on <b>competence</b> <b>level</b> of the workers and reality. Lower conceptual level of importance was observed for cleaning enterprises of different sizes compared with regional safety delegates and occupational hygienists. Risk index values show no difference in risk level between small and large enterprises. ConclusionTraining of cleaning workers lacks the prerequisite for suitability and effectiveness to counter risks of chemical health hazards. There is dereliction of duty by management in the sector resulting in a lack of competence among the cleaning workers. Instituting acceptable easily attainable safety <b>competence</b> <b>level</b> for cleaners will conduce to risk reduction, and enforcement of attainment of the <b>competence</b> <b>level</b> would be a positive step...|$|R
