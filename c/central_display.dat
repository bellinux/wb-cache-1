5|$|Lion taming {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established circus or as an individual act, such as Siegfried & Roy. The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as tigers, leopards, and cougars. The practice was pioneered {{in the first half of}} the nineteenth century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh who both toured widely, and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers. Van Amburgh performed before Queen Victoria in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a pantomime titled Les Lions de Mysore ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed equestrianism acts as the <b>central</b> <b>display</b> of circus shows, but truly entered public consciousness in the early twentieth century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries. The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by placing his head in the lion's mouth. The now iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American Clyde Beatty (1903–1965).|$|E
500|$|The V-22 is {{equipped}} with a glass cockpit, which incorporates four Multi-function displays (MFDs, compatible with night-vision goggles) and one shared <b>Central</b> <b>Display</b> Unit (CDU), to display various images including: digimaps, imagery from the Turreted Forward Looking Infrared System primary flight instruments, navigation (TACAN, VOR, ILS, GPS, INS), and system status. The flight director panel of the Cockpit Management System (CMS) allows for fully coupled (autopilot) functions that take the aircraft from forward flight into a [...] hover with no pilot interaction other than programming the system. The glass cockpit of the canceled CH-46X was derived from the V-22. The fuselage is not pressurized, and personnel must wear on-board oxygen masks above 10,000 feet.|$|E
500|$|Of {{the three}} {{multi-function}} displays (MFD), the <b>central</b> <b>display</b> is for navigational and mission data, the display {{to the left}} of the center shows aircraft status and electronic warfare information, and the display to the right of the center has sensory and fire control information. [...] In two-seat variants, the rear seat's displays can be operated independently of the pilot's own display arrangement in the forward seat, Saab has promoted this capability as being useful during electronic warfare and reconnaissance missions, and while carrying out command and control activities. In May 2010, Sweden began equipping their Gripens with additional onboard computer systems and new displays. The MFDs are interchangeable and designed for redundancy in the event of failure, flight information can be presented on any of the displays.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{comments}} on three aspects of POLYNET's {{implementation of the}} Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) model to measure functional polycentricity at the local scale. These aspects are: (1) the use of advanced producer services (APS) office locations {{as a proxy for}} inter-city relations, (2) the problematic calculation of the functional polycentricity index, and (3) the narrow conceptualization of functional polycentricity. Alternative methodologies based on transaction link data are introduced to examine whether <b>Central</b> Belgium <b>displays</b> features of a functionally polycentric mega-city-region. The results suggest {{that this is not the}} case: <b>Central</b> Belgium <b>displays</b> more features of a hierarchical urban system with Brussels as the dominant service city. However, some indications are found for a preliminary urban network formation...|$|R
