50|$|AUI used a {{full-sized}} 15-pin D connector (model DA-15) {{that used}} a sliding clip for mechanical connections {{in place of}} thumbscrews. AAUI replaced these with a small 14-position, 0.05-inch-spaced ribbon <b>contact</b> <b>connector.</b> The connector may {{have been changed to}} avoid confusion with the monitor port on early Macintoshes, which also used a 15-pin D connector. The connector was locked into position using two clips or hooks {{on the sides of the}} connector outside of the D shell (where screws often are on D subs) which automatically clicked on when plugged in, and could be removed simply by pulling back on a sliding sheath over the body of the connector, disengaging the hooks. Third-party AAUI devices often omitted this sheath, requiring the user to directly squeeze small tabs on the sides of the plug housing to detach the hooks.|$|E
40|$|Novel <b>contact</b> <b>connector</b> {{materials}} such as extrinsic conducting polymers improve contact performance and enables device miniaturisation. This paper presents an investigation of conducting polymer materials to minimise the effect of fretting at the contact interface of connector terminals. Initial experimental studies are presented and a mechanical model is {{used to describe the}} polymer interface slip and stick characteristics. For fretting to be minimised the polymer must be sufficiently elastic, with a high coefficient of friction with the contacting terminal, and a sufficient normal force to ensure no slip. Electrical experimental studies of a polymer-tin interface have also been carried out to characterise contact resistance performance under fretting conditions. A resistance model of the polymer interface is developed...|$|E

50|$|A {{connection}} standard, such as RJ11, specifies {{not only}} the physical aspects of an electrical connector, but also the pinout, i.e. the assignment or function of each <b>contact.</b> Modular <b>connectors</b> are specified for the registered jack (RJ) series of connectors, {{as well as for}} Ethernet and other connectors, such as 4P4C (4 position, 4 <b>contacts)</b> modular <b>connectors,</b> the de facto standard on handset cords, often improperly referred to as RJ connectors.|$|R
40|$|Novel <b>contact</b> <b>connector</b> {{materials}} such as conducting polymers are becoming available which improve performance and enable further miniaturisation. Studies of a polymer-tin interface {{have been carried out}} to characterise contact resistance performance under fretting conditions. Degradation mechanisms have been identified using contact resistance measurements and surface analysis tools. These mechanisms {{have been shown to be}} different to those found in the tin-tin interface. The polymer-tin interface performs significantly better than a clean tin-tin interface, requiring more than three times the number of fretting cycles to fail (attaining 200 m?). The study shows that debris is not deposited at the end of the wear track as in a tin-tin interface. Additionally, once the contact resistance attains high values, the polymer-tin interface recovers to low values. The elastic contact is proposed as an advantageous characteristic of conducting polymers which can be used to eliminate fretting at the contact interface...|$|E
40|$|Investigations on <b>contact</b> <b>connector</b> {{materials}} for different {{applications such as}} in the automotive industry have focused toward the increasing interest of using conducting polymers, as compared to conventional metallic contacts. The aim is to achieve overall improvements in performance as well as cost effectiveness. Currently, extrinsic conducting polymers (ECPs) are employed as conductive coats or adhesives at contact interfaces. However, frictional abrasion within the metal doped polymer (ECP) causes fretting corrosion, which leads to instability in the contact resistance. To overcome this, intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) are explored. Hemispherical contact coatings were fabricated using poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiopene) (PEDOT) or polyaniline/polyvinylchloride (PANI/PVC) commodity blends. Contact resistances were taken using four-wire resistance measurement techniques. The conductivities of in-house fabricated ICP contacts were found to be in the range of 10 2 S cm 1. The response relating the change of contact resistance under varying compression force appeared to be repeatable with minimum deviation of 2 %. The surface profiles of the ICP contacts were also recorded by an optical confocal system. The initial investigation results presented in this paper were used to evaluate and validate the hypothesis of employing ICP contacts to eliminate or minimize wearing and fretting effects...|$|E

50|$|Hermetic vs. Water-Proof vs. Water-Resistant {{refers to}} the {{coupling}} seal between the <b>contacts,</b> <b>connector</b> insert and body. A true hermetic connector provides an airtight seal and can support and maintain positive pressure or a vacuum. Waterproof connectors prevent liquid ingress when immersed {{using a variety of}} methods (e.g., molding, potting and encapsulating) to prevent water intrusion at high hydrostatic pressures. Water resistant implies that a coupled connector will prevent water ingress that can lead to shorting in shallow standing water or rain. Typically this is achieved by inserting rubber gaskets and compression seals at the contract region {{as well as at the}} cable entry.|$|R

50|$|The {{functions}} of <b>contacts</b> in electrical <b>connectors,</b> be they power- or signaling-related, must be specified {{in order for}} connectors to be interchangeable. When connected, each <b>contact</b> of a <b>connector</b> must mate with the contact on the other connector that has the same function. If contacts of disparate functions are allowed to make contact, the connection may fail and damage may result.

50|$|Another {{common use}} of {{dielectric}} grease {{is on the}} rubber mating surfaces or gaskets of multi-pin electrical connectors used in automotive and marine engines. The grease again acts as a lubricant and a sealant on the nonconductive mating surfaces of the connector. It is not recommended {{to be applied to}} the actual electrical conductive <b>contacts</b> of the <b>connector</b> because it could interfere with the electrical signals passing through the connector in cases where the contact pressure is very low. Products designed as electronic connector lubricants, on the other hand, should be applied to such <b>connector</b> <b>contacts</b> and can dramatically extend their useful life. Polyphenyl ether, rather than silicone grease, is the active ingredient in some such connector lubricants.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of these}} contacts was for switching in telephone exchanges, for which there were many patterns. Two sets of change-over contacts, isolated from the <b>connector</b> <b>contacts,</b> were common. The more recent pattern of one NC contact for each signal path, internally attached to the <b>connector</b> <b>contact,</b> stems from their use as headphone jacks. In many amplifiers and equipment containing them, such as electronic organs, a headphone jack is provided that disconnects the loudspeakers when in use. This is done by means of these switch contacts. In other equipment, a dummy load is provided when the headphones are not connected. This is also easily provided by means of these NC contacts.|$|R

30|$|A {{conclusive}} {{agreement about}} the best treatment solution in terms of functional and esthetic needs of the patient was not achieved, and it involves not only orthodontists but also general dentists. Advantages and limits of treatment options are still discussed. Both treatments are long, difficult, invasive, and expensive. The perception of patients is not strictly related to standardized protocols and technical implications which certainly affect clinicians' decisions. The absence of maxillary lateral incisors could affect smile esthetics either with treatment or not. Diastemas, tipping, retention of deciduous teeth, and midline deviation could be common in these patients if not treated. In some cases, patients could prefer a less invasive treatment of tooth remodeling rather than orthodontic treatment {{which may be the}} treatment option proposed by dentists and orthodontists. Some studies [12] show that, compared to dentists and orthodontists, patients could accept a wider range of smile deviations such as midline deviation or smile with deviation from the long axes of the lateral incisors. Also, the size of smile deviation should be evaluated. Midline deviations seem to be more tolerated if less than 2 mm [13]. Alterations due to the absence of maxillary lateral incisors involve aspects of cosmetic dentistry such as tooth proportionality, <b>contacts,</b> <b>connectors,</b> and embrasures, and gingival characteristics [14], which should be taken into account for diagnosis and treatment procedures. The agenesis could be monolateral or bilateral, producing asymmetric or symmetric alterations with different treatment needs [15]. Esthetics {{plays an important role in}} managing these clinical situations, and in some cases, dentists and orthodontists emphasize its importance more than functional aspects [16].|$|R
