2500|$|An {{electrical}} telegraph was independently {{developed and}} patented in the United States in 1837 by Samuel Morse. His assistant, Alfred Vail, developed the Morse <b>code</b> <b>signalling</b> alphabet with Morse. The first telegram in the United States {{was sent by}} Morse on 11 January 1838, across two miles (3km) of wire at Speedwell Ironworks near Morristown, New Jersey, although it was only later, in 1844, that he sent the message [...] "WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT" [...] from the Capitol in Washington to the old Mt. Clare Depot in Baltimore. From then on, commercial telegraphy took off in America with lines linking all the major metropolitan centres on the East Coast within the next decade. The overland telegraph connected {{the west coast of}} the continent to the east coast by 24 October 1861, bringing an end to the Pony Express.|$|E
2500|$|Morse code {{is a type}} of {{character}} encoding that transmits telegraphic information using rhythm. Morse code uses a standardized sequence of short and long elements to represent the letters, numerals, punctuation, and special characters of a given message. After many years of development, an electrical telegraph came to exclusively refer to a signaling telegram, as an operator makes and breaks an electrical contact with a telegraph key, resulting in an audible signal at the other end produced by a telegraph sounder which is interpreted and transcribed by an operator. The short and long elements are formed by sounds, marks, or pulses, in on off keying and are commonly known as [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] or [...] "dits" [...] and [...] "dahs". In 1832, Alfred Vail in collaboration with Samuel Morse, began the process of co-inventing the Morse <b>code</b> <b>signalling</b> alphabet. After a few minor changes, including the development of International Morse code which is distinct from the original encoding system, American Morse code, Morse code was standardized in 1865 by the International Telegraphy Congress in Paris, France and later made the norm by the International Telecommunication Union. After 160 years of continuous use, international regulations beginning on January 31, 1999, no longer required ships at sea to call for help in an emergency using Morse code or the famous SOS signal.|$|E

He later improved Branly's coherer by adding a [...] "trembler" [...] which dislodged clumped filings, thus restoring the device's sensitivity. In August 1898 he got , [...] "Electric Telegraphy", that made wireless signals using a Ruhmkorff coil for the transmitter and a Branly coherer for the detector. This patent utilized the concept of [...] "syntonic" [...] tuning. In 1912 Lodge sold the patent to Marconi.|$|E

5000|$|By 1653, the Royal Navy {{had issued}} {{instructions}} by which an admiral could signal various orders by hoisting flags in various locations on his ship. Modern naval <b>code</b> <b>signalling</b> {{began with the}} invention of maritime signal flags in the mid-17th century by the Duke of York who was created Lord High Admiral after the Restoration. A ship's message had {{to be approved by}} the Officer of the watch, and his system was augmented and changed in various ways over the following century. In 1790, Admiral Lord Howe issued a new signal book for a numerary system using numeral flags to signal a number; the number indicated the message, not the mast from which the flags flew. Substitute flags were also instituted to indicate repeated numerals, and there was consideration of making the flags more distinct. In 1799, Captain Sir Home Popham published his first list of words and sentences which could be referenced by a number (or [...] "code"); three subsequent editions added letter flags, with the 1801 edition numbering 2994 codes. Popham's code was famously used for the [...] "England expects that every man will do his duty" [...] signal at Trafalgar by Nelson.|$|E

5000|$|Squawk {{codes are}} four-digit octal numbers; the dials on a {{transponder}} read {{from zero to}} seven, inclusive. Thus the lowest possible squawk is 0000 and the highest is 7777. Four octal digits can represent up to 4096 different codes, which is why such transponders are often called [...] "4096 code transponders." [...] Care must be taken not to squawk any emergency code during a code change. For example, when changing from 1200 to 6501 (an example of an assigned air traffic control squawk), one might turn the second wheel to a 5 (thus 1500), and then rotate the first wheel backwards in the sequence 1-0-7-6 to get to 6. This would momentarily cause the transponder to squawk the code 7500, which is an emergency <b>code</b> <b>signalling</b> to ATC that the aircraft has been hijacked, causing an unnecessary false alarm situation. However, while {{it is important to}} not select an emergency code by mistake, pilots are also instructed to avoid setting the transponder in [...] "standby mode" [...] as a means of avoiding accidental selection, as it causes the loss of target information by ATC. Modern digital transponders allow the direct selection of squawk codes, without having to cycle past other numbers.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of blind {{separation}} of spatially correlated signals, which is encountered in some emerging applications, e. g., distributed wireless sensor networks and wireless surveillance systems. We preprocess the source signals in transmitters prior to transmission. Specifically, the source signals are first filtered by a set of properly designed precoders and then the <b>coded</b> <b>signals</b> are transmitted. On the receiving side, the Z-domain features of the precoders are exploited to separate the <b>coded</b> <b>signals,</b> from which the source signals are recovered. Based on the proposed precoders, a closed-form algorithm is derived to estimate the <b>coded</b> <b>signals</b> and the source signals. Unlike traditional blind source separation approaches, the proposed method does not require the source signals to be uncorrelated, sparse, or nonnegative. Compared with the existing precoder-based approach, the new method uses precoders with much lower order, which reduces the delay in data transmission and is easier to implement in practice...|$|R
