He hopes {{that he will}} charm celebrity members for the deal to go through, but one Congresswoman (Latifah) demands more {{diversity}} in the NBC programming lineup. As a result, Jack enlists Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> new development ideas. Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), the head writer of the fictitious sketch show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) is {{fed up with the}} criticism her writing staff gives her, and finally Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) helps Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) reapply in the competitive NBC page program.|$|E

After having his {{assistant}} Jonathan spy on Banks, he learns that Banks is gay and that he is interested in Kenneth. Jack sends Kenneth to try to gather information on what Banks is planning to do, but Kenneth is inept and fails at the task. Jack then enlists Liz to help him <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> ideas so that he can impress the network and win the power coup over Banks. Jack sends Kenneth to seduce Banks again so that he will be late for the important meeting, but Banks sees through the plan and arrives at the meeting anyway.|$|E
25|$|In July 1996, five consortia {{were awarded}} $1m to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> concepts. Three {{received}} follow-on contracts in January 1997, but the Navy had lost {{enthusiasm for the}} project with Boorda's suicide in May 1996, and in April 1997 the Arsenal Ship was redesignated as the Maritime Fire Support Demonstrator (MFSD), {{which would be a}} technology demonstrator for a revitalised SC-21 program. As a result, Congress cut funding to the project and it was finally canceled in October 1997. The Arsenal Ship concept was revived in 2002 by converting four Ohio-class submarines into SSGNs carrying 154 VLS tubes.|$|E

25|$|While Jolson was touring with a stage show during June 1927, {{production}} on The Jazz Singer {{began with the}} shooting of exterior scenes by the second unit. In late June, Alan Crosland headed to New York City to shoot the Lower East Side and Winter Garden exteriors on location. Jolson joined the production in mid-July (his contract specified July 11). Filming with Jolson began with his silent scenes; the more complex Vitaphone sequences were primarily done in late August. Both Jolson and Zanuck would later take credit for thinking up the ad-libbed dialogue sequence between Jack and his mother; another story had it that Sam Warner was impressed by Jolson's brief ad-libbing in the cabaret scene and had Cohn <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> lines on the spot. On September 23, Motion Picture News reported that {{production on}} the film had been completed.|$|E
25|$|Portal {{had been}} under {{development}} for about a year, at a state where there were only test chambers that the player moved between. Valve found from playtesting that while players had fun with the game's concept, they were left asking of where these puzzles were leading towards. The team worked to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> type of narrative, coming down to creating an antagonist that would guide the player in {{early part of the}} game but become the goal that the player would strive for by the end. The creation of GLaDOS to serve this purpose began with a discussion between the Valve team and Wolpaw on the narrative constraints they had to deal with. When they were designing the game, they found {{that they did not have}} enough time or staffing to use human characters, due to the amount of animation work and scene choreography involved.|$|E

500|$|Introduced as a singer-songwriter, Lavigne's {{involvement}} produced significant issues. Lavigne has {{implied that}} she is the primary author of the album. In an article published in Rolling Stone magazine, Lavigne stated that while working with The Matrix, one member would be in the recording studio while they were writing, but did not write the guitar parts, lyrics, or the melody. According to Lavigne, she and Christy wrote all the lyrics together. Graham would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> guitar parts, [...] "and I'd be like, 'Yeah, I like that,' or 'No, I don't like that.' None of those songs aren't from me." ...|$|E
500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} before the band {{settled on the}} eponymous name. Kretz explained, [...] "We've always tried {{to come up with}} very witty and interesting names for our records and we just felt that it was time, 18 years into the Stone Temple Pilots career, to put out a self-titled album." [...] Robert agreed that the new title was a testament to the [...] "new chapter" [...] in the band's career. Weiland also felt the band was starting over and thought the music expressed this on its own. [...] "We don't need to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> major conceptual title. The image on the cover and the music speak for themselves." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding Wolverine {{within the}} context of the X-Men film series, Tom Charity of CNN commented: [...] "Serviceable but inescapably redundant, this Wolverine movie does just enough to keep the X-Men {{franchise}} on life support, but the filmmakers will have to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> evolutionary changes soon if it's going to escape X-tinction." [...] Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times expressed that [...] "X-Men Origins: Wolverine will most likely manage to cash in on the popularity of the earlier episodes, but it is the latest evidence that the superhero movie is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue." [...] On a more negative note, Philip French of The Observer said that the film's [...] "dull, bone-crushing, special-effects stuff" [...] is [...] "of interest only to hardcore fans who've probably read it all in Marvel comics." ...|$|E
500|$|When writing [...] "Vincent and the Doctor", Curtis put up {{prints of}} Van Gogh {{paintings}} {{around the house}} {{as well as a}} board with index cards outlining the plot. His children helped him <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> ideas. Gillan commented that the story had a different style and approach and was more character-driven. Though it was a subject he knew [...] "quite a lot" [...] about, he still read a 200-page biography of Van Gogh, which was more research than he normally would have done if working on other projects; he took Van Gogh very seriously. As such, he wanted to be [...] "truthful rather than cruel" [...] and refused to write any jokes about Van Gogh's ears after he famously cut one of them off. However, he did incorporate other humour as he naturally wanted to [...] "try to make things funny".|$|E
500|$|Composing team Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori scored Reach. O'Donnell wrote [...] "somber, more visceral" [...] music {{since the}} plot is character-driven and focuses on a planet that is already known—in the Halo fictional universe—to have fallen. The first music he wrote for Reach was played for the game's world premiere, and he {{used it as a}} {{starting}} piece to develop further themes. [...] O'Donnell began work on Reach while ODST, for which he also wrote the music, was still in production, but did not begin composing until August 2009. Past Halo collaborators Salvatori, C. Paul Johnson, and Stan LePard assisted O'Donnell. With Reach, he did not give them strictly divided responsibilities. [...] "I decided this time to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> themes, tempos, keys, and other basic starting points for musical ideas," [...] explained O'Donnell. [...] "I shared these with all the other composers and just asked them to take off if they felt inspired by any of that material." [...] The works-in-progress they came up with were either retouched by O'Donnell or sent back to be finished by their composer.|$|E
5000|$|Producer Friedman <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> {{publicity}} stunts for the film, such {{as giving}} theater-goers [...] "vomit bags" [...] and intentionally taking out an injunction against {{the film in}} Sarasota, Florida, {{in order to gain}} publicity.

500|$|The episode, {{being the}} series premiere, {{features}} the first {{usage of the}} theme song by pop punk band Nerf Herder. Parry Gripp, the band's songwriter, guitarist, and admitted fan of the show explained that the band created the theme song after [...] "fancy pants Hollywood" [...] failed to write a theme song that the producers approved. Eventually, [...] "they [...] asked a bunch of local, small time bands who they could pay very little money to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> ideas and they liked our idea and they used it." [...] Several songs by the band Sprung Monkey play during the episode. When Buffy is deciding what to wear, the song [...] "Saturated" [...] is playing faintly in the background. At The Bronze, the band plays their songs [...] "Believe", [...] "Swirl", and [...] "Things are Changing". All of the songs featured in the episode {{can be found on}} their 1995 album Swirl. The score for the episode, as well as all first season entries, was created by Walter Murphy.|$|E

50|$|Swirly Termination is {{an album}} by British band Ozric Tentacles. Though {{released}} in 2000 this record contains songs made {{as early as}} 1992.

2500|$|Initially, Phair {{worked on}} several album tracks with {{songwriter}} Michael Penn as the producer. When she submitted the finished Penn-produced album to Capitol, the label {{gave it a}} lukewarm reception and was unwilling to release it as submitted.

Phair's collaboration with the Matrix resulted in only four songs, but much of the media attention focused solely on the Matrix-produced tracks, which were a departure from her earlier work. The album received many negative reviews, especially from the independent music press, who accused Phair of [...] "selling out" [...] by making the record very pop-oriented.|$|E
