40|$|Abstract: Wind load {{is the key}} and {{sensitive}} for tower structure but national standards {{tend to think that}} level stiffness change of cup type transmission tower is uniform along the height. The structure stiffness change of cup type transmission tower was simulated innovatively and found its nonuniformity. The result shows that the structural stiffness uniformly changes along the height when the flow direction parallel to the <b>cross</b> <b>arm</b> while the stiffness of crank <b>arm</b> and <b>cross</b> <b>arm</b> has mutations when the flow direction is vertical to the <b>cross</b> <b>arm.</b> Horizontal stiffness change causes a significant change of wind vibration coefficient. A simulation analysis was performed about wind-induced response of cup-tower to obtain the change rule of wind vibration coefficient. Furthermore, proposed the approximate calculation formula of wind vibra-tion coefficient at crank <b>arm</b> and <b>cross</b> <b>arm...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The SMART (SensoriMotor Active Rehabilitation <b>Training)</b> <b>Arm</b> is a nonrobotic device {{designed}} to allow stroke survivors with severe paresis to practice reaching. It {{can be used with}} or without outcome-triggered electrical stimulation (OT-stim) to augment movement. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of SMART <b>Arm</b> <b>training</b> when used with or without OT-stim, in addition to usual care, as compared with usual care alone during inpatient rehabilitation. Methods: Eight stroke survivors received 20 hours of SMART <b>Arm</b> <b>training</b> over 4 weeks; they were randomly assigned to either (1) SMART <b>Arm</b> <b>training</b> with OT-stim or (2) SMART <b>Arm</b> <b>training</b> alone. Usual therapy was also provided. A historical cohort of 20 stroke survivors formed the control group and received only usual therapy. The primary outcome was Motor Assessment Scale Item 6, Upper Arm Function. Results: Findings for all participants were comparable at baseline. SMART <b>Arm</b> <b>training,</b> with or without OT-stim, led to a significantly greater improvement in upper arm function than usual therapy alone (P =. 024). There was no difference in improvement between training with or without OT-stim. Initial motor severity and presence of OT-stim influenced the number of repetitions performed and the progression of SMART <b>Arm</b> <b>training</b> practice conditions. Conclusion: Usual therapy in combination with SMART <b>Arm</b> <b>training,</b> with or without OT-stim, appears to be more effective than usual therapy alone for stroke survivors with severe paresis. These findings warrant further investigation into the benefits of SMART <b>Arm</b> <b>training</b> for stroke survivors with severe paresis undergoing inpatient rehabilitation during the subacute phase of recovery...|$|R

Before installation in a real dam to evaluate dam behavior, numerical model described in this paper is carried out on a prototype dam to check the optimum installation, using <b>cross</b> <b>arm</b> measurements. Three <b>cross</b> <b>arm</b> installations at the upstream, the core and downstream to measure displacements are considered. The installation options considered are three <b>cross</b> <b>arm</b> combinations for best installation to verify the safety of dams and to reduce cost. Finite element method is used for generating the displecement field in a linear elastic numerical model. The generated data is used as an input data in the back analysis to check the adequacy of each installation option...|$|R

Based on force balance test, the tower and <b>cross</b> <b>arm</b> of typical 500 kV power transmission tower have been investigated in wind tunnel using three wind speeds considering Reynolds effect. The test {{results show that the}} shape coefficient keeps the same at different wind speed, which means that Reynolds effect on transmission tower can be ignored.

Over 4 wk of self-administered, home-based SMART <b>Arm</b> <b>training,</b> the participant completed 2, 100 repetitions unassisted. His wife provided support for equipment set-up and training progressions. Clinically meaningful improvements in arm impairment (strength), activity (arm and hand tasks), and participation (use of arm in everyday tasks) occurred after training (at 4 wk) and at follow-up (at 16 wk). Areas for refinement of SMART <b>Arm</b> <b>training</b> derived from thematic analysis of the participant’s and researchers’ journals focused on enabling independence, ensuring home and user friendliness, maintaining the motivation to persevere, progressing toward everyday tasks, and integrating practice into daily routine. These findings suggest that further investigation of self-administered, home-based SMART <b>Arm</b> <b>training</b> is warranted for people with stroke who have severe upper-limb disability...|$|R
50|$|A {{school bus}} <b>crossing</b> <b>arm</b> is a safety device {{intended}} {{to protect children from}} being struck while crossing in front of a school bus. Typically, school bus <b>crossing</b> <b>arms</b> are wire or plastic devices which extend from the front bumper {{on the right side of}} the bus while it is stopped for loading/unloading and form a barrier. The purpose of the device is that children who need to cross the road will be forced to walk several feet forward of the front of the bus itself before they can begin to cross the road, thus ensuring that the bus driver can see them as they cross in front of the bus, avoiding a common blind spot immediately in front of the bus. The <b>crossing</b> <b>arm</b> retracts flush against the bumper while not activated, such as when the bus is in motion.|$|R
