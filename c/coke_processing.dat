2500|$|The Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway was {{a company}} built on and around taking coal north out of Pennsylvania. The {{financial}} backer {{of the newly}} founded Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad, the banking house of Adrian Iselin, owned not only {{an interest in the}} rail line but coal mines and <b>coke</b> <b>processing</b> facilities. The Iselin presence {{at the southern end of}} the BR was such that today's maps of the coal mining region show such place names as Adrian, Adrian Furnace, Adrian Mines, and Iselin Heights; moreover, the railroad named one entire branch after him. Iselin's intention was to ship 2000 tons of coal daily, to which end Iselin and the railroad established the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company, entirely owned by the R Walston H Brown was president of both corporations. The company town at the southern end of the railroad, in the [...] acquired by the coal company in the Punxsutawney area, was given the name Walston, Pennsylvania. The initial coal production facilities yielded approximately six hundred tons daily, at a total mine-to-carload cost of seventy-three cents per ton.|$|E

50|$|The Illawarra Coke Company (ICC) {{is located}} in Coalcliff and Corrimal, in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia where {{historically}} coal was mined {{on the slopes of}} the Illawarra escarpment. After the mines were closed, coke making still occurs on these sites. The company is the only independent producer of metallurgical and foundry coke in Australia and has been privately owned since 1996. It produces premium grade <b>coke</b> for metallurgical <b>processing</b> and foundry to Australian and overseas base metals producers for lead and zinc smelting and iron production for steelmaking. The company's two cokeworks are adjacent to all major transport links.|$|R
40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of hydrocarbons over zeolites {{has been applied}} in large scale petroleum-refining processes. However, there is always formation and retention of heavy by-products, called coke, which causes catalyst deactivation. This deactivation {{is due to the}} poisoning of the acid sites and/or pore blockage. The formation of <b>coke</b> on hydrocarbon <b>processing</b> catalysts is of considerable technological and economic importance {{and a great deal of}} work has been carried out to this study. The main aim of this work is to understand the deactivation of zeolite catalysts as a result of coke deposition. The deactivation by coke of USHY zeolite was investigated during {{catalytic conversion}} of hydrocarbons – 1 -pentene, n-heptane and ethylbenzene – as representatives of olefins, paraffins and aromatics respectively, at different reaction temperatures, time-on-streams and composition. Three novel techniques, coke classification, thermogravimetric method for characterising coke precursors and indirect temperature programmed desorption (TPD) for catalyst acid sites characterisation were developed to further study catalyst deactivation mechanism. Product distribution, coke formation, characterisation of coke precursors, as well as the role of strong acid sites on hydrocarbon reactions are presented and discussed. During catalytic reactions of 1 -pentene over USHY zeolite, cracking and hydride transfer were the predominant reactions in initial stage which deactivated rapidly allowing isomerisation to become the main reaction afterwards. Deactivation studies showed that coke formation was very strong initially which is in good correlation with the initial rapid deactivation. The hydrogen freed during this initial time from the formation of high C/H ratio coke components contributed to the formation of hydride transfer products. The amount of coke precursors decrease with increasing reaction temperature due to the higher desorption of coke precursors into gas phase while hard coke amount increased with temperature as expected from an activated process. The coke amount formed was not proportional to the reactant feed composition, because of a strong pseudo-zeroth- order initial coking on strong acidic sites. The thermogravimetric method provides insight into the chemical character of coke precursor components in terms of the mode of their removal and allows further classification of coke precursors into small and large coke precursors. The concentration and strength of acid sites of coked catalysts were studied by the TPD methodology. Besides, characterisation of coke precursors was also revealed. The initial deactivation preferentially on strong acid sites is very fast. The concentration of free acid sites is inversely correlated well with the total concentration of coke rather than individual coke groups. Coke precursors tend to be more stable at higher reaction temperatures. Furthermore, by selectively poisoning strong acid sites of USHY zeolite, it shows conclusively that strong acid sites are responsible for cracking and hydride transfer reactions as well as strong coke formation while weak acid sites can only catalyse double bond isomerisation. ...|$|R

40|$|In most midwestern states water {{availability}} is rarely an issue, {{because there are}} many lakes and rivers from which to extract water. However, there are areas in the world and even in the United States in which water is not readily available. As the world’s population grows and developing nations realize higher standards of living, the amount of water needed will rise. One important use of water is in manufacturing. There are three scopes for water use in manufacturing: direct use in the process (scope 1), through the energy used to perform the process (scope 2), and the water used during manufacturing to create the materials that are consumed (scope 3). One of the most common metals used in manufacturing is steel. This study breaks down the production of steel, from iron ore to raw steel, to quantify a total water footprint. Each step considers scopes 1, 2, and 3. The water used to create one kilogram of steel included 12. 8 liters of water for scope 1, 0. 2790 liters of water for scope 2, and 692. 1 liters of water for scope 3. The process that was responsible for the largest portion of water use was the production of coke. <b>Coke</b> <b>processing</b> (scope 3) uses 98 % of the total water needed and should receive the greatest attention in efforts to reduce water use in steel production...|$|E
