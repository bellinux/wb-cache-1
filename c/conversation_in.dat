5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the <b>conversation</b> <b>in</b> depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E
5|$|Le souper de Beaucaire was a {{political}} pamphlet written by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1793. With the French Revolution into its fourth year, civil war had spread across France between various rival political factions. Napoleon was involved in military action, on the government's side, against some rebellious cities of southern France. It was during these events, in 1793, that he spoke with four merchants from the Midi and heard their views. As a loyal soldier of the Republic he responded in turn, set on dispelling the fears of the merchants and discouraging their beliefs. He later wrote about his <b>conversation</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of a}} pamphlet, calling {{for an end to the}} civil war.|$|E

5|$|Vargas Llosa rose to fame in the 1960s with novels such as The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros, {{literally}} The City and the Dogs, 1963/1966), The Green House (La casa verde, 1965/1968), and {{the monumental}} <b>Conversation</b> <b>in</b> the Cathedral (Conversación en la catedral, 1969/1975).

5|$|A {{report by}} Baldassare Ceola, the police {{commissioner}} of Palermo, {{concluded that the}} crime had probably been carried out by Mafiosi Carlo Costantino and Antonino Passananti under Cascioferro's direction. Evidence was thin, however, and the case was effectively closed when in July 1911 the Palermo Court of Appeals discharged Cascioferro, as well as Costantino and Passananti, due to insufficient evidence {{to send them to}} trial. Petrosino's murder was never solved. Nevertheless, Costantino and Passananti were identified as the most likely assassins. Costantino died in the late 1930s and Passananti, in March 1969. In 2014, more than a century after the assassination, the Italian police overheard a tapped phone <b>conversation</b> <b>in</b> which a sibling claimed that Paolo Palazzotto had been the killer on the orders of Cascioferro. Palazzotto had been arrested after the shooting, but had been released for lack of evidence.|$|E

In {{the countries of the}} EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than the UK, Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll, 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a <b>conversation</b> <b>in</b> that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.|$|E

5|$|Early {{during the}} game's development, Nomura already had various scenes in mind such as Terra's and Riku's <b>conversation</b> <b>in</b> order {{to explain the}} latter's ability in the {{original}} games. Various parts from the plot had to be modified to make the game more light-hearted such as Eraqus' death {{at the hands of}} Xehanort after being defeated by Terra, how Aqua's scenario was supposed to end with her already trapped in the Realm of Darkness, and the relationship between Ventus and Sora. Two of the newly introduced protagonists, Ventus and Terra, were based on other characters from the franchise while Aqua's design did not have a base. Nevertheless, the three wear outfits meant to expand the student-and-teacher bond shown in the game. The Disney worlds were chosen to expand the characters of the Princesess of Light as well as Maleficient's who are connected with the events of the first Kingdom Hearts game, while the worlds of Neverland and Deep Space were chosen to add variety to the game, and Olympus Coliseum was selected to reflect the game's earlier setting compared to the original Kingdom Hearts.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Jeunet {{included}} an alternate {{version of the}} film on the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set with different opening and closing credits, which were originally cut due to budget restrictions.

The special edition restores 13 minutes and 5 seconds worth of footage (including the new opening and ending), and is 7 minutes longer than theatrical version. Jeunet has stated that the special edition is not a director's cut as his preferred version is the theatrical cut.|$|E

After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward <b>conversation</b> <b>in</b> which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E

5|$|On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright {{performed}} {{together as}} Pink Floyd {{for the first}} time in more than 24years, at the Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park. Organiser Bob Geldof arranged the reunion, having called Mason earlier in the year to explore the possibility of their reuniting for the event. Geldof asked Gilmour, who turned down the offer, and then asked Mason to intercede on his behalf. Mason declined, but contacted Waters who was immediately enthusiastic. Waters then called Geldof to discuss the event, scheduled to take place in one month. About two weeks later Waters called Gilmour, their first <b>conversation</b> <b>in</b> two years, and the next day the latter agreed. Gilmour then contacted Wright who immediately agreed. In their statement to the press, they stressed the unimportance of the band's problems in the context of the Live8 event.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} Mario Vargas Llosa {{are viewed as}} both modernist and postmodernist novels. Though {{there is still much}} debate over the {{differences}} between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as The Green House and <b>Conversation</b> <b>in</b> the Cathedral, are clearly elements of the modern novel. Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude—another important defining aspect of modernist art. By contrast, his later novels such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta, and The Storyteller (El hablador) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing. These novels have a much lighter, farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism. Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, The Green House and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.|$|E

He also meets Rogério, an injectable drugs user committed by his family, who tells him {{it is impossible to}} escape and that if he were to try he would be drugged with haloperidol or electrocuted. Rogério also tells him not to consume the medications administered by nurses because it awakes the appetite in order to make patients look healthier. Meanwhile, Cintra has a <b>conversation</b> <b>in</b> which he discusses that if necessary he could easily admit more people, mostly homeless, to avoid losing the government subsidy.|$|E
