5|$|Textiles {{from the}} most {{utilitarian}} to the most luxurious are made from animal fibres such as wool, <b>camel</b> <b>hair,</b> angora, cashmere, and mohair. Hunter-gatherers have used animal sinews as lashings and bindings. Leather from cattle, pigs and other species is widely used to make shoes, handbags, belts and many other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur, to make items such as coats and hats, again ranging from simply warm and practical to the most elegant and expensive.|$|E

Camels have outer guard hairs and soft inner down, and the fibers are sorted by color {{and age of}} the animal. The guard hairs can be felted for use as {{waterproof}} coats for the herdsmen, while the softer hair is used for premium goods. The fiber can be spun for use in weaving or made into yarns for hand knitting or crochet. Pure <b>camel</b> <b>hair</b> is recorded as being used for western garments from the 17th century onwards, and from the 19th century a mixture of wool and <b>camel</b> <b>hair</b> was used.|$|E

25|$|Tabriz is {{the market}} {{center for the}} Iranian Northwest. Carpets woven in this region mainly use the {{symmetric}} knot. Heriz is a local center of production for mainly room-size carpets. Warps and weft are of cotton, the weaving is rather coarse, with high-quality wool. Prominent central medaillons are frequently seen with rectilinear outlines highlighted in white. The ornaments of the field are in bold, rectilinear style, sometimes in an allover design. Higher quality Heriz carpets are known as Serapi. The village of Sarab produces runners and galleries with broad main borders either of <b>camel</b> <b>hair</b> or wool dyed in the colour of <b>camel</b> <b>hair.</b> Large, interconnected medaillons fill the field. Mostly rectilinear, geometric and floral patterns are dyed in pink red and blue. Bakshaish carpets with a shield-shaped large medaillon, less elaborate rectilinear patterns in salmon red and blue are labeled after the village of Bakhshayesh. Karadja produces runners with specific square and octagonal medaillons in succession.|$|E

[...] He said that he had kept the body in a hidden location, and he intended to take it on tour across North America in 2014. He released photos of the body and a video showing a few individuals' reactions to seeing it, but never released any of the tests or scans. He refused to disclose the test results or to provide biological samples. He said that the DNA results were done by an undisclosed lab and could not be matched to identify any known animal. Dyer said that he would reveal the body and tests on February 9, 2014 at a news conference at Washington University, but he never made the test results available. After the Phoenix tour, the Bigfoot body was taken to Houston. On March 28, 2014, Dyer admitted on his Facebook page that his [...] "Bigfoot corpse" [...] was another hoax.
