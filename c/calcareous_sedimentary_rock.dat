40|$|ABSTRACT: Clay {{minerals}} of <b>calcareous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> {{of southern}} Iran, {{part of the}} old Tethys area, were investigated in order to determine their origin and distribution, and to reconstruct the palaeoclimate of the area. Chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and thin-section studies were performed on the 16 major <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Fars and Kuhgiluyeh Boyerahmad Provinces. Kaolinite, smectite, chlorite, illite, palygorskite and illite-smectite interstratified minerals were detected in the rocks studied. The results revealed that detrital input is possibly the main source of kaolinite, smectite, chlorite and illite, while in situ neoformation during the Tertiary shallow saline and alkaline environment could be the dominant cause of palygorskite occurrences in the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> The presence of a large amount of kaolinite in the Lower Cretaceous sediments and the absence or rare occurrence of chlorite, smectite, palygorskite and illite are in accordance with the warm and humid climate of that period. Smaller amounts of kaolinite and the occurrence of smectite in Upper Cretaceous sediments indicate the gradual shift from warm and humid to more seasonal climate. The occurrence of palygorskite and smectite and the disappearance of kaolinite in the late Palaeocene sediments indicate the increase in aridity which has probably continued to the present time...|$|R

40|$|The {{sedimentary}} rock-hosted disseminated gold (SRHDG) {{deposits in}} southwest Guizhou Province, China, are lo-cated near the buried {{edge of the}} Yangtze Craton. Three deposits, Lannigou, Getang and Zimudang, were chosen for this study. The deposits are hosted by fine-grained clastic and <b>calcareous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> and formed at low temperatures from low salinity solutions of low to intermediate pH and low fO 2. Chemical analyses of the ores and host rocks show that high field strength elements, such as Nb, Ta, Zr and Hf, were immobile during hydrothermal alteration. However, rare earth elements (REE) were mobile. Light rare earth elements (LREE) were depleted, whereas heavy rare earth elements (HREE) were enriched. A differentiation of platinum group elements (PGE) concentrations was documented. The ores are enriched in Pd and Pt, consistent with the higher solubility of these two elements in ore fluids. The Pd/Ir ratios of the ores are {{lower than those of}} the ultramafic rocks and the Emeishan basalts in the region. Thus, the ultramafic intrusives and basalts could not have been the main source of the PGEs and gold in the SRHDG deposits. Rather, these metals were derived mainly from the <b>sedimentary</b> host <b>rocks</b> as evidenced by the trace element and stable isotopic characteristics of the ores. Our data suggest that the SRHDG deposits in southwest Guizhou are most likely of amagmatic origin, which is con-sistent with the lack of igneous intrusives {{in the vicinity of the}} deposits, the very weak metamorphic grade of the rocks, the lack of metamorphic effects within the time range of the SRHDG deposits, and coincidence in time of gold minerali-zation with regional extension...|$|R

Kaolinite was the dominant mineral of the clay fraction with moderate amounts of goethite and hematite. Gibbsite was only present in Ak 1 profile under more humid conditions contributing to high anion exchange capacity (AEC). Trace element concentrations in these soils conform to those for worldwide normal soils. However, the extraordinary high arsenic (As) concentration in Ak 1 soil represents a hazardous concentration (313 mg kg- 1), {{which may have been}} inherited from the parent rock. Arsenic in this soil is probably not toxic because it is immobile in an oxidized environment, and is sorbed onto soil constituents particularly sesquioxides.

Both Myriophyllum qkatum and Myriophyllum verticillatum extend into waters having higher calcium contents than appear to be tolerated by M. alterniflorum. MyrzbphyZZum verticillatum tends to occur in waters having a lower pH than many inhabited by M. spicatum.

40|$|A {{variety of}} mineral {{deposits}} were formed during the tectonic {{evolution of the}} Mascarene-Nerepis and Rolling Dam Belts, in southwestern New Brunswick. The Mascarene-Nerepis Belt is mainly underlain by intensely deformed Upper Silurian to Lower Devonian andesitic and rhyolitic volcanic rocks with interbedded calcareous siltstone and slate. The Rolling Dam Belt consists largely of Ordovician graphitic slate overlain by Upper Silurian to Lower Devonian greywacke and slate. During Middle Devonian time, both belts underwent polyphase deformation and a large batholith composed mainly of granite and related plutonic rocks was emplaced (Acadian orogeny). Base metal deposits designated as early tectonic in this report occupy dilatant structures related to group 3 folds, along the margins of these plutons. In the Mascarene-Nerepis Belt, base metal deposits occur in andesite and rhyolite tuffs, and <b>calcareous</b> pelitic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> deformed by these structures. Gold-arseno-write-quartz veins occupy similar structures in graphitic slate of the Rolling Dam Belt. A few early tectonic deposits occur. in plutonic rocks.

These rocks belong to the Quebradagrande and Arquía Complexes. Along the section, structural data and samples for thin sections analysis were obtained mostly in the western block adjacent to the main fault trace. Metamorphic rocks include amphibolites and hornblende - garnet - zoisite ± chlorite ± muscovite ± graphite schists. Igneous bodies are granodiorite and highly serpentinized dunite. <b>Sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> are mostly sandstones and <b>calcareous</b> mudstones. These <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> exhibit faulted contacts and lenticular geometry. Most fault rocks are brittle cataclastic rocks. They include breccias, microbreccias, gouge and foliated gouge. In some samples, plastic deformation is inferred from microscopic bands of reduced grain size (mostly in quartz), deformation bands and undulose patchy and sweeping extinction in quartz, {{and to a lesser extent}} in plagioclase, indicating an incipient development of mylonitic textures formed at low-grade metamorphic conditions. This suggests an older record of localized deformation. These microstructures and other outcrop scale structures such as thrust systems (duplexes and imbricates), strike-slip and normal faults with dip and oblique components of movement, tectonic foliation, varying fault cross-cutting relationships and presence of sedimentary slices and ultrabasic serpentinized bodies along the fault zone suggest a multi-state brittle deformation and multiple reactivation of some of the fault zones. </div...|$|R
40|$|The gold-silver {{telluride}} {{deposits of}} the Emperor mine (Vatukoula, Fiji) are fairly {{typical of the}} epithermal deposits found in association with Tertiary volcanic activity in the circum-Pacific belt. The mine produces about 60, 000 troy ounces of gold per annum, together with silver and tellurium. It lies on the western margin of a Pliocene caldera (the Tavua caldera or Tavua basin) and the host rocks for the mineralization are olivine basalt flows and andesite dykes. The olivine basalt sequence is about 2000 m thick and is probably underlain by mid-Tertiary <b>calcareous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> approximately 1500 m thick. The <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> are probably underlain by early Tertiary andesitic rocks. Five phases of volcanic (and associated intrusive) activity have been recognised in the Tavua cauldron. The K-Ar dating indicates two major periods of igneous activity, Which commenced at about 10 m. y. with widespread eruptions of olivine basalt (phase I) and continued to about 7. 5 m. y. A period of quiescence followed. The later phases of volcanic activity (phases II to V) date between 5 and 4. 3 m. y. Phase II volcanism is represented by minor eruptions of trachybasalt., phase III by augite trachyandesite, phase IV by biotite trachyandesite and phase V by monzonite and trachyte. The later phases (phases III to V) are essentially intrusive in nature and are represented by cone • sheets, dykes and small plugs, and generally occur within. {{the limits of the}} caldera. Te 130 -Xe 130 dating on a telluride sample gave an age o f 7. 2 m. y. indicating that the bulk of the mineralization was probably associated with the first period of igneous activity (10 to 7. 5 m. y.). Initial hydrothermal activity resulted in widespread propylitization and carbonatization of basalt, and this was followed by limited K-silicate alteration and mineralization. The lodes are essentially fracture fillings with well-developed crustification textures and vugs. Ore-mineral, sulphide and carbonate precipitation appears to have been intermittent, whereas quartz precipitation was essentially uninterrupted, and continued after the cessation of oremineral precipitation. The ore-minerals are native gold, native tellurium and gold-silver tellurides. Paragenetic studies suggest ten stages of ore and gangue mineral precipitation, viz. stage IA: widespread propylitic alteration with the development of carbonate, chlorite, actinolite, epidote etc.; stage IB: fringe K-silicate alteration which includes K-feldspar, sericite, dolomite and sulphides; stage IIA: barren vein quartz deposition; stage IIB: vein quartz, dolomite, K-feldspar, sericite, roscoelite, native tellurium and goldrich tellurides; stage IIIA: barren vein-quartz deposition; stage IIIB: vein quartz, dolomite, K-feldspar, sericite, roscoelite, native gold • and silver-rich tellurides; stage IVA: white barren vein quartz; stage •VB: amber barren vein quartz; stage IVC: white barren quartz; and stage V: calcite deposition. The bulk of mineralization (stage IIB tellurides) is restricted to 12 level and above while stage IIIB tellurides and native gold are distributed throughout. Fluid-inclusion studies on quartz indicate a temperature range from 20. 5 to 317 °C during stage IIA and from 170 to 210 °C during stage IIIA. Temperatures during stage IVA, IVB and IVC ranged from 160 to 2400 C and peaked around 180 ° C. Fluid inclusions in stage V calcite are rare and very small, and generally lack a visible vapour phase; no temperature determinations were possible. Temperatures during stage IIA show an apparent increase with depth but no such changes are apparent during other stages.
