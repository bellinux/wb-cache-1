40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of <b>pumping</b> to place <b>concrete,</b> the development and refinement of the industry practice to ensure successful <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> are becoming important needs for the concrete construction industry. To date, research on <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> has been largely limited to a few theses and research papers. The major obstacle to conduct research on <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> is that it requires heavy equipment and large amounts of materials. Thus, developing realistic and simple measurement techniques and prediction tools is a financial and logistical challenge that is out of reach for small research labs and many private companies in the concrete construction industry. Moreover, because <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> involves the flow of a complex fluid under pressure in a pipe, predicting its flow necessitates detailed knowledge of the rheological properties of concrete, which requires new measurement science. This paper summarizes the technical challenges associated with <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> and the development in <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> that have been published in the technical literature and identifies future research needed for the industry to develop best practices for ensuring successful <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> in the field...|$|R

30|$|<b>Concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> {{involves}} {{the flow of}} a complex fluid under high pressure in a pipe, and thus predicting flow behaviors of <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> is challenging research area. For the characterization and prediction {{of the flow of}} <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping,</b> the fundamental understanding of various factors is needed, which include rheological properties, dynamic segregation, stability of constituent materials, geometry of a pumping circuit, slip layer formed between bulk concrete and a pipe wall, and relationship between the pressure and flow rate. The flow of concrete in a pipe differs from the one of typical viscous fluids like water or oil. The primary difference is that concrete is a yield stress fluid. Therefore, there {{is at the center of}} the pipe (i.e. around the symmetry axis where the shear stress is equal to zero) a zone where the concrete is not sheared (Jacobsen et al. 2009). Most researches on <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> in the literature account for the yield stress and the existence of the unsheared zone (Vassiliev 1953; Kaplan et al. 2005; Feys and Schutter 2005) by assuming that concrete behaves as either the Bingham fluid or the Herschel Buckley fluid. The second reason for the difference is that under the action of shear, the redistribution of particles occurs within a pipe, which is a common feature of particle suspensions. Initially well mixed particles in a concentrated suspension flows undergo migration from high shear rate regions to low shear rate regions (Phillips et al. 1992; Ingber et al. 2009; Lu et al. 2008). During <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping,</b> shear concentrates in the fluid layer of material depleted of the coarsest particles of <b>concrete.</b> Therefore, the <b>pumping</b> of <b>concrete</b> can be generally considered to be the shearing of an annular layer of unknown thickness and made of a material with certain rheological properties.|$|R

50|$|The second main type of <b>concrete</b> <b>pump</b> {{is either}} {{mounted on a}} truck or placed on a trailer, and it is {{commonly}} referred to as a line pump or trailer-mounted <b>concrete</b> <b>pump.</b> This pump requires steel or flexible concrete placing hoses to be manually attached to the outlet of the machine. Those hoses are linked together and lead to wherever the concrete needs to be placed. Line pumps normally pump concrete at lower volumes than boom pumps and are used for smaller volume concrete placing applications such as swimming pools, sidewalks, and single family home concrete slabs and most ground slabs.|$|E

Also, the price increase of materials is very important item in the high-rise buildings. Especially, <b>concrete</b> used high-pressure <b>pump</b> due to consecutive structural assembly. Unlike slump type of ordinary concrete, high strength concrete has different properties of <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> due to viscosity. However, {{there have been no}} Korean studies on the pumping properties of high strength concrete. Therefore, this paper measures the friction factor of high strength concrete with changes in the pressure of <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping.</b> We analyzed the trends of the friction factor based on changes in the pressure of <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping,</b> and then calculated the quantity of concrete deposited for each specified concrete strength and location of placement. After comparing these results with the quantity of concrete deposited measured in field, we evaluated the pumping properties of high strength concrete.
