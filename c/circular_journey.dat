This way of thinking and looking at li, when applied to Jing zuo, was that a person needed to combine both thinking and action in order to achieve enlightenment. Investigation of things and the world around you were very important aspects and teachings of Zhu Xi. [...] "He also believed that knowledge and action always required each other."(Yao, p 220). According to Zhu Xi, in order to achieve enlightenment, an individual must be actively seeking knowledge, investigating ideas/events, meditate upon them, and then investigate some more. [...] "According to this understanding, spiritual meditation is like a <b>circular</b> <b>journey</b> of tranquility and activity, or of preserving the mind and investigating the principle, or of knowledge and action." [...] (Yao, p 220). For Zhu Xi, Jing zuo [...] "does not mean to 'sit still like a blockhead, with the ear hearing nothing, the eye seeing nothing, and the mind thinking of nothing."(Yao p 220). It meant actively searching out, investigating, and exploring the world that a person lives in.|$|E

40|$|John Donne was a {{firm believer}} in the circle and the {{circular}} world around him. Circle images are pervasive in his poetry, such as the compass image in "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning, " and the lovers as a world in "The Sunne Rising. " Donne used circle imagery to express a variety of relationships, man to woman, man to God, man to himself, and man to nature. I have picked three poems which best show Donne's complex and intense use of the circle. All three involve a journey, a <b>circular</b> <b>journey.</b> It is through each of these circular journeys that the particular relationship is clarified, felt, and understood. The first poem is "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning," which deals with the man to woman relationship. The second poem, "Good Friday, 1613. Riding Westward," is concerned with the man to God relationship, which also involves the man to self relationship. The third poem, "The First Anniversarie," is more complicated in both its imagery and its tone than the first two poems. Unlike the other two poems, it is concerned not with one relationship, but several, encompassing man to God, man to himself, man to nature and man to man...|$|E
40|$|After 1989, the Polish legal elites {{have embraced}} a {{transformation}} discourse, presenting modern Polish legal {{history as a}} <b>circular</b> <b>journey</b> from Europe to the dystopia of "Communism" and back.

40|$|Abstract: Apenas uma narrativa uses several core {{principles}} of Surrealism {{to construct a}} <b>circular</b> <b>journey</b> between reality and dream. Above all, there is an intention in this work to praise the unconscious. This {{is part of a}} general attempt by twentieth century artists to propose an alternative to the prevailing rational and logical mode. In the case of Apenas uma narrativa, this is not only achieved by the surrealist matrix, but also through the semiotics of the illustrations {{and the use of the}} Freudian concept of the uncanny. The various experimental journeys carried out by the protagonist of the story are situated at the intersection between the internal and the external dimensions of the human condition. This challenge can only be grasped by an inner transformation of the subject, hence the various metamorphoses present in the text. Nevertheless, surmounting this apparent chaos, Apenas uma narrativa achieves a certain harmonization, even in terms of conventional story-telling. Finally, Pedro‘s vision of art being an encounter between different artistic realms is expressed in Apenas uma narrativa through the references shared by the text, the illustrations within the book, and the paintings of the author. The interplay between visual and scenic features therefore establishes this text as an attempt to eliminate barriers between text and image...|$|E

40|$|Extract] The lasting {{impression}} I carried with me after visiting Chewton was the crushed quartz fragments erupting through the much mined, altered surface. Local quartz provides the medium {{and location of}} the outdoor component of Regeneration placed so that the elements would eventually regain their hold on the form created. Quartz is a magical, potent material existing before and outliving human time. This aspect of timelessness was central to my appreciation of the material and recognition of what form to configure the quartz. Nature to nature, place to place, within me I carry some knowledge, some blood, some cultural memory of my ancestors. One ancestor, Woretermoeteyenner, was a Tasmanian Aboriginal woman who traveled widely during her life, meeting and working with people of many cultures through {{the first half of}} the 1800 s. Woretemoeteyenner's name means eucalyptus leaf and I feel strongly connected to her in the presence of these majesterial beings. A representation of a Tasmanian eucalypt leaf is one object, left signaling my visit, that I feel able to leave behind outside here as an ephemeral marker from deep within. In planning a <b>circular</b> <b>journey</b> between the indoor gallery and the outside installation site I developed the indoor work as a point of departure and return. A trail of six bronze leaves tracking up a eucalypt trunk provide a different means of memorial than the more unstructured external quartz leaf that changes with every rain. The golden bronze refers to the alluvial goldfields of Chewton and also the alchemical magic of molten metal. Each cast leaf traces a generation from Woretermoeteyenner to me, the same leaf, our regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Part I. The {{theme of}} Pauline {{tradition}} is mentioned by Barrett and Schenke, and further, Roloff and Plamacher indicate traditional material behind {{the image of}} Paul in Acts, part of which is analyzed by burchard and Loning (ch. l). The date of Acts is placed {{at the end of}} the first century and the author confronted Jewish Christianity crossed with Gnosticism (ch. 2), Historical criticism, form criticism and redaction criticism are methodological principles for our investigation. Any source theories are problematical. However, the author utilized traditional material in depiction of Paul in Acts, namely, the Pauline traditions, which are parallel to the Pauline Epistles, the Pauline legends, which are parallel to the miracle stories in the synoptic tradition, and the local community traditions (ch. 5). Part II. Paul's background in Acts (Jewish, Hellenistic and Roman) is based on the Pauline traditions. Judaizing and anti-Jewish tendencies are seen in it (ch. 4), Paul's pre-conversion period is also based on the Pauline traditions, but coloured with Judaizing tendencies (ch. 3). Paul's conversion and call are due to traditional material, out modified with literary devices. Anti-gnostic tendencies can be traced behind it (ch. 6). The earliest years after conversion and call are based on tradition; however, it is dominated by anti-Jewish tendencies (ch. 7). The first missionary journey is not totally a "model” journey, but two parts of it are based on the Pauline traditions respectively together with the Pauline legends. But the author arranged them in order to make a <b>circular</b> <b>journey.</b> Judaizing tendencies and ambivalent anti-Jewish tendencies are seen in it (ch. 8). In the second missionary journey, in contrast to the first one, the local community traditions are employed together with the Pauline traditions and the Pauline legends. Judaizing tendencies are seen in it (ch. 9). The Pauline traditions, the Pauline legends and the local community traditions are utilized in the depiction of the third missionary journey. Apologetic tendencies against syncretism and paganism are seen in it (ch. lO). The image of Paul in Acts is not only based on traditional material but also transformed by the author in order to defend the legitimacy of the Gentile mission under anti-Pauline attacks. Acts is governed by rhetorical Peripatetic historiography (ch. 11) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{critical}} {{contribution of}} women in upholding the State's responsibility for children in need of care and protection in New Zealand has not been sufficiently recognised. This thesis traces the development of child protection legislation from the Destitute Persons Relief Ordinance 1846 to the current Children, Young Persons and their Families Act 1989. It examines the socio-political influences that contributed to changes over time, and the various roles women have played as social workers, foster mothers, and kin carers. The <b>circular</b> <b>journey</b> from family responsibility in 1846, to state control, then to the Children, Young Persons and their Families Act 1989 and again, back to family responsibility, has been drawn. Re-interrogating my own research phenomenologically and drawing on my social work experience, the thesis gives evidence {{of the effects of}} the current legislation, the Children, Young Persons and their Families Act (1989), on families/wh?nau, and children. The thesis methodology is feminist autobiography and tells a second journey of care and protection. My experiences of being raised by kin, my work as a foster mother, a social worker, a university lecturer and researcher tell this story. These two journeys are braided together where paths cross or run parallel. The use of critical feminist theory as an analytical tool and feminist phenomenology as a methodology has revealed the reality of experience {{of women in}} varying roles, who throughout time have cared for children in need of care and protection. Social workers, foster parents, the children?s biological parents and kin/wh?nau carers of these children, and the children themselves have been part of my journey. The thesis, firstly, makes a contribution to social work literature as it offers an understanding of the effect of child welfare legislation and the incumbent power therein on the lives of families, children and social workers. It also argues that the influence of early life experiences on professional choice demands ethical reflective self-examination. Secondly, the thesis contributes to academic autobiographical research methodology, arguing for its ability to honestly locate the researcher in the field of enquiry and enhance the richness of the study. ...|$|E
40|$|As a genre, fantasy {{seeks to}} {{validate}} the unconscious world of dreams, to insist not merely on its existence in the human psyche, but on its essential, vital presence. A work of fantasy begins, typically, with the implicit or explicit suggestion of 2 ̆ 2 preferable modes of reality 2 ̆ 2 (Spivack 1987, x) and moves toward the hero 2 ̆ 7 s integration of previously unconscious elements of the self. The narrative structure mirrors that movement: {{at the heart of}} fantasy is the journey toward a goal and the subsequent return home. This <b>circular</b> <b>journey</b> is an apt metaphor for the quest for identity, which is the focus of my dissertation. To be 2 ̆ 2 at home 2 ̆ 2 [...] spiritually and soulfully with our deepest selves, one guide in the fantasy realm insists [...] is the ultimate goal of mortal life. ^ The introductory chapter contains an overview of relevant Jungian concepts of archetypes and the collective unconscious and Eriksonian life-cycle psychology which help illuminate the universal elements of the hero 2 ̆ 7 s quest. The choice of works for my study reflects my premise that the quest for identity takes shape according to the hero 2 ̆ 7 s place in the life cycle. The pragmatic values, goals, and struggles of persona-crafting, for example, differ greatly from those of mid-life reckoning with mortality. Lewis Carroll 2 ̆ 7 s Alice 2 ̆ 7 s Adventures in Wonderland and John Ruskin 2 ̆ 7 s tale, 2 ̆ 2 The King of the Golden River 2 ̆ 2, are the focus of the second chapter, which concerns the individuation of child heroes.

In the fourth chapter, the quest for a renewed sense of identity {{takes the form of a}} dialectic between past and present selves in C. S.

40|$|Loop: The {{stupid things}} that adults do The Thanet Loop is a bus route that circumnavigates Margate, Ramsgate and Broadstairs. This {{continuous}} service {{acts as a}} conveyer to the community, delivering children to school, patients to the hospital, commuters to their places of work and shoppers to town centres. In its own modest way ‘The Loop’ circulates life through Thanet, creating a pulse or a perpetual rhythm. The project ‘Loop: the stupid things that adults do’ explores {{the idea of a}} <b>circular</b> <b>journey</b> with the intention of investigating repetition. In his book ‘Rhythmanalyisis,’ philosopher Henri Lefebvre identifies two types of repetition, circular and linear. Circular repetition develops from the cosmos and occurs naturally in days, seasons, tides and phases of the moon. While linear repetition is a social construct, imposed by structure, which can result in monotonous behaviour, such as daily commutes or routine visits to the dentist. These two patterns of repetition consistently and repeatedly effect and interfere with each other, creating patterns and sequences that are part of daily life. These cycles overlap and infuse, as individual patterns of behaviour briefly entwine within the enclosed space of the bus. Furthermore, in bringing together separate individuals or trajectories there cannot be any absolute repetition, as there will always be an interjection of difference or unforeseen circumstances. The aim of each image is to record the duration of a full circuit of ‘The Loop’ in one single flat image. Repeating exactly the same journey on different days and at slightly varying times, the work explores the differentiation that can occur in replication. All the individual journeys, commutes and routines are collocated and re-presented into a distinct image for each loop. The resulting images have two titles; the first is a code that relates to the time of the trip, marking it out through a classification process. The second is produced from the conversations overheard on each particular journey. Photography as a medium is fatally intersected by temporality; the camera reduces everything to a still frame, objectifying it through a process. Time and its complex rhythms are simplified, to a state where they are traces of what has passed. Photographs as images are removed from the continuous pressures of time, allowing the subject to be contemplated, examined and considered at leisure. In order to record the whole journey within a single image, the photographs are taken using a purpose made pinhole camera. Slowly absorbing the changes before the lens, each image becomes a representation of the journey and what passed before the camera on that specific excursion. Each unique image is characterised by the people using the bus, who punctuate the journey by choosing where the bus stops. These interruptions leave an imprint within the photographs produced. However, the main emphasis of each image is the light absorbed by the film, capturing the mood or atmosphere of that day. Thanet is renowned for the unique quality of light, which has attracted artists such as J. M. W. Turner to the area. This variation and luminosity of light comes into focus through the series and creates a unique collection of images...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} a round-table that I put together. Below please find the abstract for the entire round-table session, including my contribution. Uncommon Times Recently, a number of critics have argued that the temporalities of nineteenth-century U. S. literature eluded the measurable progressions of the clock, the calendar, and the nation. The myriad timescapes hatched in literature were far too irregular or, as Lloyd Pratt puts it, disaggregatingto bear any close relation to the cultures official forms of timekeeping. This roundtable explores the concept of the commons as a temporal phenomenon in order to ask what times, if any, we Americanists have in common with one another and with those experienced in the nineteenth century? Do we impose a unified time to make a period legible as an object of study, or can the texts we examine help produce our categories of analysis? Do different genres or traditions have their own times? And if so, how can we put texts in conversation to examine intersections between the different times of the nineteenth century? To begin, Cody Marrs considers how recent insights into literatures temporalities bear directly on broader questions about the periodic boundaries of American literary studies. If this literature is marked by its non-linearity, to what degree can it be historically situated and categorized? And in what ways was nineteenth-century literature self-periodizing? Marrs will address these questions by examining how two well-known antebellum texts, Thoreaus Walden and Douglasss The Heroic Slave, provide us with a set of internal time frames for remapping the nineteenth century. Engaging the theoretical questions Marrss talk raises through case studies of antebellum texts, each of the four subsequent presentations focuses on relations between time and enslavement. Kevin Modestino examines the intervention abolitionist historians made into dominant ideas of historical time. He argues that these writers produced an aesthetics of slave revolution that struggled to recover marginal spaces and times irreducible to romantic historys narratives of progress. Nick Bromell offers an account of the political theory implied by Harriet Jacobss representation of time as a <b>circular</b> <b>journey</b> {{in which there is no}} final escape from the perversity of human nature. Resisting closure and keeping remainders in play, Jacobss Incidents preserved the future of democratic politics more effectively than much democratic theory. Jeffrey Inskos talk looks at a little known address delivered by William Lloyd Garrison in 1857 entitled The Dead Past and the Living Present in order to explore the historicity of immediatist abolitionism. Immediatisms resistance to liberal progressive historiography that is, immediatisms vision of history that advances fitfully in unforeseen directions represented one species of romantic presentism in the literature and culture of the United States during the first half of the nineteenth century. Kelly Rosss presentation on Melvilles Benito Cereno builds on Inskos analysis of the conflict between immediatists and gradualists. Ross reads Babos intelligence temporally, arguing that Babo manipulated the two white captains by recognizing and strategically negotiating multiple temporalities, a temporal flexibility which Delano and Cereno lacked. Ross links Melvilles depiction of the limits of Babos heterochronic intelligence to a critique of the gradualist position. Finally, Lloyd Pratt will offer a response to the presentations...|$|E
