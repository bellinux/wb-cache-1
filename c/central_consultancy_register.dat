It is a national requirement to protect those and keep it for future generations. In order to cater that requirement the government had decided to build a new building. <b>Central</b> engineering <b>Consultancy</b> bureau (CECB) is given new building design and construction. The key objective for this research is to provide energy efficient lighting system for the new building with minimal adverse effect on the service life of the archival materials. Energy efficient is vital at a national and international level. Proposed designed luminaries with the T 5 fluorescent tube provide the opportunity reduced electricity consumption and better illumination. Use of natural daylight helps to further minimize electricity usage. By introducing different Illumination levels to different areas provide user friendly lighting environment.

40|$|This study set out {{to explore}} the current usage and {{knowledge}} of new media as a public relations tool and channel amongst practicing public relations consultants in Australia. The research was motivated by a nationwide benchmarking study by de Bussy and Wolf (2009), which concluded that new media was an extremely low priority for Australian public relations practitioners. Taking into account the speed of change associated with new media adoption, the authors examine whether these findings are still true today. This study takes a qualitative approach, based on a critical analysis of semi-structured interviews with WA based <b>Registered</b> <b>Consultancy</b> Group (RCG) members of the Public Relations Institute of Australia (PRIA) (n= 7). Findings suggest a cautious attitude towards the benefits of new media amongst RCG consultants. This is largely based on the assertion that the dynamics of basic communication principles and theories have not changed {{and that there is}} consequently no perceived pressure to move into the new media sphere half heartedly...|$|R
40|$|A {{considerable}} portion in {{the construction}} industry of Sri Lanka is covered by the government sector and organizational structure of most of them is different and they use different strategies for performing projects. There is no unique organizational structure for all the organizations in the government sector {{in the construction}} industry. Most of organizations in government sector follow a centralized management system and decentralized system not much significant. <b>Central</b> Engineering <b>Consultancy</b> Bureau (CECB) as a government organization bare a large portion of construction and consultancy works {{in the construction industry}} of Sri Lanka at present and it is a grate example for practicing decentralized management system to perform project undertaken by it. It has separate eighteen sub divisions under Additional General Managers and this separate sub divisions function independently with sub organizations structures using delegations of authority. Deputy General Managers, project managers and other technical staff members directly working under Additional General Managers. Five AGM divisions of CECB out of eighteen were selected for the case study done under this research and three persons namely AGM, DGM and PM were interviewed from each division according to a semi-structured interview. Content analysis and cognitive mapping techniques were used for data analysis in this research. Cross-case analysis includes a comprehensive comparison between the selected cases and with the extant literature. It was observed that there are three most significant features affect to superiors in delegation of authority Viz.; saving time and energy, releasing of operational working load, opportunity for real top management functions and five most significant features affect to subordinate 'in delegation of authority Viz.; autonomy, decision making, responsibility, participation, and motivation and satisfaction and six most significant factors leading to effective delegation of authority Viz.; goals and roles, authority, communication, control mechanisms, trust and understanding, and rewarding and training...|$|R
40|$|Investigations of the {{development}} of hydro power in the upper Walawe river basin using the head difference of about 350 m between the two pineplaines of the south eastern part of the central high lands of Sri Lanka had commenced in mid 1950 's. Several studies have been conducted since then on the possible ways of developing this potential. These studies lead to the finalization of Samanalawewa hydro power project in 1985. The scheme envisaged {{the development}} of the potential in two stages. Under the stage I major components such as main dam, low pressure tunnel,surge chamber,a single penstock add power plant of 120 MW capacity housing two generating units were to be developed. Work under stage I was completed and plant was commissioned in 1992. Stage II of the scheme envisaged the construction of Diyawini Oya reservoir, a second penstock and an extension to the stage I power house to install two additional generating units to bring the total installed capacity of Samanalawewa hydro power project to 240 MW. According to the studies the installation of additional 120 MW capacity in the second stage of the project was aimed at providing the needs of additional peaking capacity in the CEB generating system at a future date. The studies conducted in 1985 expected such requirement to be in the CEB system in early 21 st century. After completion of the wet blanketing of the reservoir to arrest the leakage which developed on the right abutment of the dam Ceylon Electricity Board wished to evaluate the feasibility {{of the development}} of stage II of the scheme {{in the early years of}} 21 " century as envisaged ill 1985. In 1999, CEB requested <b>Central</b> Engineering <b>Consultancy</b> Bureau to review the feasibility of implementing the stage II of Samanalawewa hydro power project. During this review the capacity of the existing system to cater for the conditions after the installation of additional units the feasibility of construction of Diyawini Oya reservoir and the installed capacity to be developed in the near future were evaluated. Most of components of the existing project are found to have sufficient capacity to cater for the increased flows after stage II. Some modifications are required in the surge chamber in order to connect the Intake from the Diyawini oya reservoir. A provision has already been made available for this purpose in the surge chamber. Review of the feasibility {{of the development of}} Diyawini reservoir by CECB indicated that the water tightness of the reservoir is uncertain in the light of the latest geological information available. It was also noted that any treatment of reservoir to improve the water tightness will be prohibitively costly. Accordingly CEB apparently had given up the proceeding of stage II studies. However it was interesting to investigate the possibility of using Diyawini Oya waters diverted in the direction of the surge chamber and released in to the surge chamber at a feasible point. This way additional water quantity from the stream can be pumped in to the surge chamber and it is added to generate electricity at the power station. It is very important to check the electrical energy loss when pumping such a quantity of water and then compared with the energy gain at the end. All relevant calculations were done and it indicates that the project is well profitable and impacts on Environmental and social aspects are in favor of the project...|$|R
