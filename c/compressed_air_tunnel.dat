40|$|In {{this study}} field {{measurement}} data from Feldmoching tunnel in Munich {{were used to}} develop a model with the capability of predicting the <b>air</b> losses in <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>tunnelling</b> technique. In this <b>tunnelling</b> project, <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> was used to control the groundwater and Shotcrete was used as temporary support. The ﬁnal permanent lining was added after completion of the temporary support and was done in free air condition. An evolutionary approach for modelling the air losses {{from the face of}} the tunnel was adopted in this study. Evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR) is a data-driven method based on evolutionary computing aimed to search for polynomial structures representing the target system. In this technique, a combination of the ge-netic algorithm (GA) and the least square method is used to search for the most feasible structures and the appropriate parame-ters of the selected model structures. Data from diﬀerent tunnel lengths were used in the training phase. The trained model was then used to predict the air losses during the excavation of the points of the tunnel data from which were not used in the train-ing stage of the modelling process. The results of the EPR model predictions were compared with the experimental data. It was shown that the suggested technique can learn and generalize the relationship between appropriate soil and tunnel parameters to predict air losses for diﬀerent geological and geometric conditions that were not previously seen in the training stage by the EPR, with a good degree of consistency with actual field measurements...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} {{criteria for}} predicting blowouts in <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>tunnels</b> through an integrated design approach using empirical laboratory test {{data in a}} finite element model. <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>tunnelling</b> is first reviewed {{in the context of}} temporary works, and the relative merits of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> as a support system are compared with that of other methods commonly used. Design methods for estimating the stability of tunnel faces in general are discussed along with the particular problems of stability against a blowout. The various mechanical processes that contribute to the formation of blowouts are then discussed, including unsaturated shear strength, desaturation processes, and seepage forces. A plausible mechanism which can be used analytically in studying blowouts is presented, whereby the How of air desaturates the soil causing mechanical failure, which is the result of serious reductions in effective stress due to increased pore pressures and seepage forces. The failure self propagates with changes in the soil properties. The permeability of soils with respect to compressible fluids is a complex property not only dependent on the soil properties but on fluid properties and pressures as well. Permeability with respect to air is presented as an empirical power function of pressure. Laboratory methods of measuring permeability with respect to air is discussed along with a description of all relevant apparatus. A finite element package developed by NAg software was used as the basic model of potential flow. The model was adapted to account for the progressive desaturation of the soil and its influence on permeability. The model was also modified to account for compressible flow using the Rayleigh-Janzen method of linearizing the compressible potential equation. The model was run for subaqueous tunnels of various diameters in sands of different silt contents beneath rivers of various depth. The amount of excess air pressure was varied and provision was made for a forepoling hood on the shield. Results show compressible flow and incompressible flow are essentially the same except at the crown of the tunnel face. Blowouts demonstrate the unique feature of propagating from the surface down {{as well as from the}} tunnel up, a phenomenon which is attributed to high seepage forces and negligible total stresses at the ground surface. The overall factor of safety is most sensitive under shallow rivers, and critical tunnel depth is independent of river depth. The data satisfy a linear relationship between critical depth and tunnel diameter, with smaller diameter tunnels requiring more cover relative to tunnel diameter than large diameter tunnels. The effect of a hood is most significant at high air pressures and in clean sands. The critical tunnel depth is directly proportional to air pressure and is slightly more sensitive for small tunnels than for large tunnels. The critical depth generally is not influenced by silt content. A significant exception is a large drop in critical depth for silt contents between 5 % and 10 %. The results of the study were summed up in a set of nomographs to provide practical aid to the design of tunnels against blowouts. They can be used to estimate safe cover depths and operating pressures, or to estimate factors of safety for a given set of operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{records the}} {{findings}} of a retrospective study of decompression illness (DCI) in the UK <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>tunnelling</b> industry since the mid- 1980 s. The thesis describes how the study arose, its scope and objectives, along with an overview of tunnelling and shaft-sinking. The development of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> working techniques is reviewed along with a description of decompression practice and DCI, and an outline of relevant legislation and guidance. The acquisition and manipulation of data to form a number of databases and spreadsheets on which the analysis was performed is discussed. That analysis examined measures of DCI incidence and quantified that incidence using these measures. Also considered is the variation in tolerance and susceptibility to DCI in the workforce, and the phenomenon of acclimatisation. An examination {{of the extent to which}} men worked on multiple contracts and the variation in their susceptibility to DCI on these contracts is included. Options are then considered for reducing the incidence of DCI. The first retained air-only decompression through the application of restrictions on exposure. The second related to the use of oxygen decompression. Finally the adequacy of the existing Regulations and Guidance is considered and recommendations made for possible changes to them, arising from the study. The main conclusions are that a number of measures of DCI incidence were identified, some more appropriate than others and that the incidence of DCI when so measured was high, disproportionately so in shift workers. No reasonably practicable restrictions on exposure were identified which would have allowed the retention of air-only decompression. Oxygen decompression looked promising but had yet to be used sufficiently extensively to generate enough data for analysis. Recommendations included one that an alternative technique for monitoring the effectiveness of decompression should be developed. The thesis ends with recommendations for further research...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Second World War, {{prestressed}} concrete has undergone a period of turbulent development, attributable predominantly to the intense activity in construction during this period and partly also to the change in the cost structure, which resulted in a shift from steel to {{prestressed concrete}}.

The chip temperature is lower with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling than those with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry machining. The combined effects of reduced friction and chip bending away from the cutting zone {{as a result of}} the high-speed air produce a thinner chip with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and a thicker chip with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling compared to dry machining alone. The marginally higher cutting force associated with the application of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> compared with dry machining is the result of lower chip temperatures and a higher shear plane angle.
