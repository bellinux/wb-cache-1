5|$|In addition, {{the total}} {{civilian}} population of Nanking in December 1937 {{and the size}} of the Chinese garrison defending the city are used as a basis for calculating the death toll, though the matter is complicated due to greatly varying estimates for both of these numbers. For instance, Tokushi Kasahara claims that Nanking's population in 1937 included 400,000 to 500,000 <b>civilians</b> <b>and</b> 150,000 soldiers, whereas David Askew believes it was 200,000 to 250,000 <b>civilians</b> <b>and</b> 73,790 to 81,500 soldiers.|$|E

5|$|After announcing Gotham will {{be subject}} to his rule come nightfall, the Joker rigs two {{evacuating}} ferries with explosives; one containing <b>civilians</b> <b>and</b> the other containing prisoners. He says that he will blow them both up by midnight, but will let one live if its passengers (who have been supplied the trigger to the other boat's explosives) blow up the other. Batman finds the Joker with a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of Lucius Fox. Both the <b>civilians</b> <b>and</b> the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.|$|E
