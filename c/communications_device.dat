5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's <b>communications</b> <b>device</b> also {{add to the}} atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly after the event that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Captain America's uniform {{is made of}} a {{fire-retardant}} material, and {{he wears}} a lightweight, bulletproof duralumin scale armor beneath his uniform for added protection. Originally, Rogers' mask was a separate piece of material, but an early engagement had it dislodged, thus almost exposing his identity. To prevent a recurrence of the situation, Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform, an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck. As {{a member of the}} Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a <b>communications</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

During this reprieve, the defenders repaired the mortars and PIAT that were damaged by the flood and the dust, and {{made a series of}} raids on Egypt-held structures. At 14:00, the Egyptians counterattacked but were met with heavy fire and took many casualties. This prompted the Israelis to move their only working <b>communications</b> <b>device</b> to a safer location, but it broke down, and contact with the brigade HQ was only restored at 16:00. At 17:00, the villagers again reported that their situation was critical, and that an attempted counterattack failed. The Negev Brigade intelligence officer, David Niv, intercepted an Egyptian radio message where the commander of the assault claimed to have already taken the village.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} chaser <b>communications</b> <b>device</b> is the {{cellular}} phone. These {{are used for}} both voice and data connections. External antennas and amplifiers {{may be used to}} boost signal transception. It is not uncommon that chasers travel in small groups of cars, and they may use CB radio (declining in use) or inexpensive GMRS / FRS hand-held transceivers for inter-vehicle communication. More commonly, many chasers are also ham radio operators and use the 2 meters VHF and, less often, 70 cm UHF bands to communicate between vehicles or with Skywarn / Canwarn spotter networks. Scanners are often used to monitor spotter, sometimes public safety communications, and can double as weather radios. Since the mid-2000s social networking services may also be used, with Twitter most used for ongoing events, Facebook for sharing images and discussing chase reports, and Google+ trailing in adoption. Social networking services largely (but not completely) replace forums and email lists, which complemented and eventually supplanted Stormtrack magazine, for conversing about storms.|$|E

Returned to Earth, Tom rallies {{humanity}} into a global resistance that will march on major Espheni bases all over the world. Tom leads the militias in the United States in a march on the Espheni base in Washington, D.C. With {{the help of an}} Espheni <b>communications</b> <b>device,</b> humanity learns that the Espheni serve a previously-unknown queen who comes to planets when victory is assured and the Espheni are moving from invasion to occupation. Indeed, while in Washington, Tom spots signs of the Espheni moving in on Earth. Tracking the queen to the ruins of the Lincoln Memorial, Tom confronts her alone and she informs him of the true reason for the invasion. Tom manages to infect the Espheni Queen with a Dornia bioweapon, killing her and spreading the bioweapon throughout the Espheni species. The Espheni are destroyed and the Earth is freed. Months later, humanity is united and makes plans to elect a new leader. When Tom is offered the job, he refuses it.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea of the}} Nibiru {{encounter}} {{originated with}} Nancy Lieder, a Wisconsin woman who claims that as a girl she was contacted by gray extraterrestrials called Zetas, who implanted a <b>communications</b> <b>device</b> in her brain. In 1995, she founded the website ZetaTalk to disseminate her ideas. Lieder first came to public attention on Internet newsgroups during the build-up to Comet Hale–Bopp's 1997 perihelion. She stated, claiming to speak as the Zetas, that [...] "The Hale–Bopp comet does not exist. It is a fraud, perpetrated by those who would have the teeming masses quiescent until it is too late. Hale–Bopp {{is nothing more than}} a distant star, and will draw no closer." [...] She claimed that the Hale–Bopp story was manufactured to distract people from the imminent arrival of a large planetary object, [...] "Planet X", which would soon pass by Earth and destroy civilization. After Hale–Bopp's perihelion revealed it as one of the brightest and longest-observed comets of the last century, Lieder removed the first two sentences of her initial statement from her site, though they can still be found in Google's archives. Her claims eventually made the New York Times.|$|E
500|$|Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn, {{authors of}} What Made Thunderbirds Go! The Authorised Biography of Gerry Anderson (2002), {{register}} a divergence from earlier Supermarionation productions that stems from The Secret Service being less [...] "American-orientated" [...] and comprising fewer action sequences. They consider it the [...] "most eccentric" [...] {{of all the}} Supermarionation series up to 1969, and the fusion of puppets and live actors the [...] "natural conclusion" [...] to the filming technique. The writers bestow particular praise on the characterisation of Mrs Appleby, whose ignorance of Unwin and Harding's involvement with British Intelligence adds to the comedy: for example, when Father Unwin speaks into his <b>communications</b> <b>device</b> that is disguised as a hearing aid, the housekeeper thinks that the apparently senile vicar is muttering to himself. The episodes [...] "A Question of Miracles", in which the miniaturised Matthew is dwarfed by articles of food and drink from a picnic basket, and [...] "Last Train to Bufflers Halt", whose plot concerns an unstoppable runaway train, are also well received. Stephen La Rivière, author of Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, favours [...] "More Haste Less Speed": describing the series finale as [...] "wonderfully quirky" [...] and [...] "glorious", he sees the counterfeiting plot as being reminiscent of the [...] "gentler, earlier days of Supercar", also praising Keith Alexander for his voice acting of {{the part of the}} elderly Lady Hazlewell.|$|E

2500|$|Driving {{while using}} a {{hands-free}} device is not safer than driving while using a hand-held phone, as concluded by case-crossover studies. epidemiological studies, simulation studies, and meta-analysis. Even with this information, California initiated new Wireless <b>Communications</b> <b>Device</b> Law (effective January 1, 2009) {{makes it an}} infraction to write, send, or read text-based communication on an electronic wireless <b>communications</b> <b>device,</b> such as a cell phone, while driving a motor vehicle. Two additional laws dealing {{with the use of}} wireless telephones while driving went into effect July 1, 2008. The first law prohibits all drivers from using a handheld wireless telephone while operating a motor vehicle. The law allows a driver to use a wireless telephone to make emergency calls to a law enforcement agency, a medical provider, the fire department, or other emergency services agency. The base fine for the FIRST offense is $20 and $50 for subsequent convictions. With penalty assessments, the fine can be more than triple the base fine amount. [...] (California Vehicle Code [...] §23123). Motorists 18 and over may use a “hands-free device. The second law effective July 1, 2008, prohibits drivers under the age of 18 from using a wireless telephone or hands-free device while operating a motor vehicle (VC §23124)The consistency of increased crash risk between hands-free and hand-held phone use is at odds with legislation in over 30 countries that prohibit hand-held phone use but allow hands-free. Scientific literature is mixed on the dangers of talking on a phone versus those of talking with a passenger, with the Accident Research Unit at the University of Nottingham finding that the number of utterances was usually higher for mobile calls when compared to blindfolded and non-blindfolded passengers, but the University of Illinois meta-analysis concluding that passenger conversations were just as costly to driving performance as cell phone ones.|$|E
2500|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that the TARDIS's telepathic field is what gives Rose the ability to understand and be understood by the aliens. This concept was first introduced in the Fourth Doctor serial The Masque of Mandragora, described by the Doctor as a [...] "Time Lord gift" [...] {{he shares with his}} companions. In [...] "The Fires of Pompeii", the Doctor tells Donna that translation is a [...] "gift of the TARDIS". In [...] "The Christmas Invasion", it is shown that the translation field is connected to the Doctor and stops working when he is unconscious, recovering from regeneration. Rose says this is because he is [...] "part of the circuit and he is broken". In [...] "A Good Man Goes To War", River Song implies this translation ability lingers in the mind even when people have left the TARDIS and are no longer near it. The concept of a Doctor-supercharged <b>communications</b> <b>device</b> first appeared in The Three Doctors (1972–73), where the Second Doctor modifies the Brigadier's radio telephone to allow him to contact his men through interference generated by antimatter.|$|E
