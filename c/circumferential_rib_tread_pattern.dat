40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the finite element modelling of a steel belted radial tyre under static contact load using ABAQUS code. The model combines the 3 D {{parts of the}} complex <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> and the quasi axisymmetric part of the tyre in which the tread blocks are not included. These two sections were meshed separately and linked together using a tying algorithm implemented in the code. The fibber reinforced parts of the tyre including ply, belts, and cap ply were modelled using rebar layer embedded in the surface elements. A hyperelastic material model was {{used in conjunction with}} a linear elastic one to describe the stress-strain behaviour of rubber and reinforcing fibres, respectively. The developed model was used to simulate the 175 / 70 R 14 steel-belted radial tyre subjected to inflation and contact loads. Three belts angles were selected to examine the effect of belt angle variations on the mechanical behaviour of the tyre. In addition, the results were also compared with a similar tyre model in which a simply <b>ribbed</b> <b>tread</b> was used instead of complex <b>tread</b> <b>pattern.</b> The friction between tread surface and contact road surface was simulated using the Coulomb’s friction law. The numerical results and also the comparison of experimentally measured tyre deflection under concentrated vertical load revealed that neglecting the details of the tread blocks has very minor effect on the predicted tyre deformation. However, differences can be large enough when considering secondary or higher variables such as contact pressure, stress, and strain energies. It is also shown that a belt angle of 20 o is the best comprised value among the selected design parameters...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} tractive performance of different tire treads on granular terrain by an efficient {{combination of the}} Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM). The proposed coupling method {{has been shown to}} be a sufficient technique when resolving the different length scales involved in engineering problems dealing with granular assemblies in contact with deformable bodies [1][2]. Herein, the extended discrete element method (XDEM) is used to describe the dynamics of the granular assembly. Thereby the discrete approach accounts for the motion and forces of each grain individually. On the other hand, the finite element method accurately predicts the deformations and stresses acting within the tire tread. Hence, the simulation domain occupied by the tire is efficiently described as a continuous entity. The coupling of both method is based on the interface shared by the two spatially separated domains. The interface coupling enables to apply a contact model fitting the particular contact behaviour between the grains and the tread surface. Thus, contact forces develop at the interface and propagate into each domain. The coupling method enables to capture both responses simultaneously. Each grain in contact with the tread surface generates a contact force which it reacts on repulsively. The contact forces sum up over the surface and cause the tire tread to deform. The resultant stresses are then again recognised by the granular assembly. The coupling method compensates quite naturally the shortages of both numerical methods. It further employs a fast contact detection algorithm to spare valuable computation time [1]. The proposed DEM-FEM Coupling technique was employed to study the tractive performance of four different tire treads on a soil layer of the material sand. The simulations were conducted in accordance to the experimental measurements undertaken by Shinone et al. [3]. The contact forces at the surface of smooth, lug, <b>rib</b> and block <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> are captured by 3 D simulations of different slip values of each tire tread. The simulation results are used to analyse the gross tractive effort, running resistance and drawbar pull of the different <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> in sand...|$|R

40|$|The regular tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> {{design process}} is often based upon {{experience}} and experimental evaluations and may take about 2 years. The use of engineering tooling could improve and speed up this process. The research objective is therefore to develop experimental and simulation tooling by which interior tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> noise can be predicted, analysed and optimized. The physics of tyre-road noise is {{explained in a}} comprehensive manner as {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics is needed to evaluate, measure, analyse or optimize tyres with respect to noise. The first engineering tool developed is an instrumented vehicle with dedicated measurement and processing technologies, enabling quantification of the terminology used in subjective evaluations of tyre-road noise. The three most important tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> noise characteristics are: level, tonalness and modulation/drumming. They can be quantified, respectively, by the Sound Pressure Level, the so-called order spectrum and the (bandpass filtered) sound pressure variation during one tyre revolution. While rolling on smooth roads, the tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> geometry in the tyre-road contact is considered to be the main origin of contact pressure variations, resulting in vibrations and noise. The second engineering tool is a simulation procedure of this source. In the new source modelling approach, the averaged <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> height in contact is calculated. The model predicts (R 2 = 0. 76) the correct trends of the three tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> noise characteristics, by using the trend of their geometrical cause. The model can be used to reduce exterior as well as interior tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> noise. From these tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> noise characteristics dedicated Sound Quality Metrics are defined: for level the Standard Deviation (STD), for tonalness the Order Prominence (OP) and for modulation the Multi-Order Modulation (MOM). They correspond very well (respectively R 2 = 0. 96, 0. 60 and 0. 80) with the human perception of the noise characteristics. An increase in each of the metrics results in a worse subjective perception of the tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> noise. The metrics are applicable for measured and simulated sounds. In the third engineering tool the three metrics are combined to model the human percpetion of tyre tread patternn noise. The human perception model is obtained through a linear regression of these tyre related Sound Quality Metrics on the subjective rating of simulated sounds. The output of the model is called the Sound Quality Preference Index (SQPI) predicting the human perception of tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> sounds correctly (R 2 = 0. 94). The coupled source - human perception model can be used to speed up and improve the current tyre tread patter design process...|$|R

50|$|Clinchers do {{have their}} advantages. Changing tires is much quicker since {{it does not}} involve a lengthy glueing and curing process so a rider can have a large {{selection}} of tires at their disposal.

50|$|Treads fall {{somewhere along}} the {{spectrum}} from smooth or slick to knobby. Smooth treads are intended for on-road use, where a <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> offers no improvement in traction. However, many otherwise slick tires have a light <b>tread</b> <b>pattern,</b> due to the common belief that a slick tire will be slippery in wet conditions. Knobby treads are intended for off-road use, where the tread texture can help improve traction on soft surfaces. Many treads are omnidirectional—the tire can be installed in either orientation—but some are unidirectional and designed to be oriented a certain way. Some tires, especially for mountain bikes, have a tread which is intended either for the front wheel or the rear wheel. A special <b>tread</b> <b>pattern,</b> with small dimples, has been developed to reduce air drag.|$|R

50|$|Tires {{may also}} be directional, where the <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> favors {{operation}} in one direction.

Symmetric directional tires can be used on both sides, but once mounted on a rim cannot be moved to the other side, since the <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> will be in the wrong direction. This restricts tire rotation. Some directional tires are also asymmetric, in which case there will be specific left and right-handed versions.|$|R
40|$|The characteristics, {{which include}} the cornering-force and drag-force {{friction}} coefficients and self-alining torque, were obtained on dry, damp, and flooded runway surfaces over a range of yaw angles from 0 deg to 12 deg and at ground speeds from approximately 5 to 90 knots. The results indicate that a <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> with pinholes in the ribs reduces the tire cornering capability at high yaw angles on a damp surface but improves cornering on a dry surface. A <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> which has transverse grooves across the entire width of the tread improves the tire cornering performance slightly at high speeds on the flooded runway surface. The cornering capability of all the tires is degraded at high ground speeds by thin film lubrication and/or tire hydroplaning effects.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> design for optimum wet grip performance. A mathematical model of tyre behaviour on wet roads has been developed. This utilizes the finite element method in the representation of <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> geometry. The performance of a particular <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> is found {{in terms of the}} fluid pressures and film thicknesses existing within the contact patch, under wet conditions. Many modern <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> are based on 'blocks', and a computer model has been developed specifically to assist the tyre designer in the design of these blocks for improved wet grip. Numerical results are presented both for complete contact patches and for individual tread blocks. To allow the use of the computer models by the tyre designer, with no specialist knowledge of the finite element method, special purpose mesh generation and plotting programs have been developed. Experiments have been undertaken whereby the fluid pressures and film thicknesses existing in the tyre contact patch have been measured under high speed conditions in the wet. These measure- ments were made on an indoor testing machine, and the techniques developed can be used in the routine evaluation of tyre wet grip performance. Some results of experiments performed on plain and simple patterned tyres are presented. The main purpose of this work was the development of the mathematical models which can be used for future research into, and design of, tyres for improved wet grip. However, some conclusions are made as to possible features which could be utilized in future tyre designs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In general, when {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} a sedan vehicle’s tire <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> design on the noise generated, the noise is measured by first carving the tires and then using expensive laboratory equipment to perform the measurements. The advantages of using this method are that the experimental results and the noise level produced from the tires (that go into mass production) feature minimal differences and that reliable tested data are produced. The disadvantages of this method are that molds must be created to produce slicks, and that substantial time is invested in the process of artificial carving and performing subsequent experiments, all of which increase the tire development time and cost. Therefore, {{the effect of a}} sedan vehicle’s tire <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> design on rolling noise was predicted in this study by employing the numerical calculation methods used in calculating fluid mechanics.
