A grizzly bear was photographed near Cascade pass in October2010, {{and as many as}} twenty grizzlies may be living in the Cascades, south of the Canada–US border. Wolves, pine martens lynx, wolverines, cougars, weasels, and black bears are also present, and are usually {{detected}} by camera traps. During the summer, bears consume up to 30,000 <b>calories</b> <b>a</b> day in preparation for hibernation, in a dietary phase known as hyperphagia. There have also been attempts to re-introduce fishers to the region. Cougars are mainly nocturnal and solitary, and are so secretive that they are seldom seen. Wolves were eradicated from the Cascades by the 1930s, but began re-establishing resident packs at least as early as 1990.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} a {{commonly}} cited truism since the early 1960s. The tautological phrase means that regardless of the form of food <b>calorie</b> <b>a</b> person consumes (whether a carbohydrate, protein or fat calorie) the energy chemically extracted from the food, or the work necessary to burn such <b>a</b> <b>calorie,</b> is identical to any other. One dietary calorie contains 4.184 kilojoules of energy. With this knowledge, {{it is easy to}} assume that all calories have equal value.|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, much of Europe was devastated. Sustained aerial {{bombardment}} {{during the}} war had badly damaged most major cities, and industrial facilities were especially hard-hit. The region's trade flows had been thoroughly disrupted; millions were in refugee camps living on aid from United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and other agencies. Food shortages were severe, especially in the harsh winter of 1946–47. From July 1945 through June 1946, the United States shipped 16.5 million tons of food, primarily wheat, to Europe and Japan. It amounted to one-sixth of the American food supply, and provided 35 trillion calories, enough to provide 400 <b>calories</b> <b>a</b> day for one year to 300 million people.|$|E

25|$|Some people—including German soldiers—benefited {{from the}} black market, where food was sold without tickets at very high prices. Farmers {{especially}} diverted meat to the black market, which meant that much less for the open market. Counterfeit food tickets were also in circulation. Direct buying from farmers in the countryside and barter against cigarettes became common. These activities were strictly forbidden, however, and thus carried the risk of confiscation and fines. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. In the more remote country villages, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens {{and the availability of}} milk products permitted better survival. The official ration provided starvation level diets of one thousand thirteen or fewer <b>calories</b> <b>a</b> day, supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, MREs {{have been}} {{developed}} using the Dietary Reference Intake, created by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The IOM indicated servicemembers (who were classified as highly active men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 30) typically burn about 4,200 Calories (kcal) a day, but tended to only consume about 2,400 <b>Calories</b> <b>a</b> day during combat, entering a negative energy balance. This imbalance occurs when servicemembers fail to consume full portions of their rations. Although manipulations to the food items and distribution of macronutrients to help boost the amount of kilocalories per MRE have been made, more studies are showing many servicemembers still do not meet today's standards of daily consumption, often trading and discarding portions of the ration. Researchers continue to study the habits and eating preferences of servicemembers, making constant changes that encourage servicemembers to eat the entire meal and thus get full nutritional value.|$|E
500|$|The {{physical}} trainers {{also had}} to ensure that {{not only do the}} actors look like soldiers before filming, but they had to remain that way throughout the shoot. In addition, Stapleton and Winchester had to lose and gain weight, respectively. Winchester had to be on a diet of 4,000 <b>calories</b> <b>a</b> day, which included taking protein shakes between meals. The actor described the diet as [...] "a workout in itself," [...] having found it [...] "exhausting" [...] eating more food than he was used to. In total, training took approximately one month.|$|E

500|$|Bánáthy {{reunited with}} his family in Austria. As the war ended and Austria was {{occupied}} in April 1945 by the French, British, Soviet and US military forces, the family was placed in an Allied displaced persons camp. They were housed in a single [...] room in a wooden barrack; it served as their bedroom, kitchen, living room and firewood storage area. Food was extremely scarce and at times they subsisted on around 600 calories per person per day. They were among 1.4 million displaced persons in Austria at the time during a worldwide food shortage {{as a result of the}} war. Food was also severely restricted by punitive U.S. policies including directive JCS 1067. In 1947 German citizens were surviving on 1040 <b>calories</b> <b>a</b> day, but the Allies were also suffering from food shortages.|$|E
500|$|By October {{the inmates}} were {{evacuated}} to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, where inmates were suffering from severe overcrowding and {{a shortage of}} food. Wiesenthal's big toe on his right foot had to be amputated after a rock fell on it while he {{was working in the}} quarry. He was still ill in January when the advancing Soviets forced yet another evacuation, this time on foot, to Chemnitz. Using a broom handle for a walking stick, {{he was one of the}} few who survived the march. From Chemnitz the prisoners were taken in open freight cars to Buchenwald, and a few days later by truck to Mauthausen concentration camp, arriving in mid-February 1945. Over half the prisoners did not survive the journey. Wiesenthal was placed in a death block for the mortally ill, where he survived on 200 <b>calories</b> <b>a</b> day until the camp was liberated by the Americans on 5 May 1945.

In terms of his character Jackman views Wolverine as [...] "the ultimate outsider" [...] and that [...] "the great battle, I always thought with Wolverine, is the battle within himself". Regarding Logan's struggle with extreme life longevity, Jackman said, [...] "He realizes everyone he loves dies, and his whole life is full of pain. So it's better that he just escapes. He can't die really. He just wants {{to get away from}} everything." [...] Jackman stated that he ate six meals a day in preparation for the role. Jackman contacted Dwayne Johnson for some tips on bulking up for the film. Johnson suggested that for six months, he gain a pound a week, by eating 6,000 <b>calories</b> <b>a</b> day which consisted of [...] "an awful lot of chicken, steak and brown rice".|$|E
40|$|All foods contain energy, {{although}} {{the amount of}} potential energy stored will vary greatly {{depending on the type}} of food. When we eat food, our bodies convert the stored energy to chemical energy, allowing us to do work. The energy values of food are measured by the <b>Calorie,</b> with <b>a</b> capital C. <b>A</b> <b>Calorie</b> is equal to 1, 000 calories or 1 kilocalorie (kcal). <b>A</b> <b>calorie</b> is the amount of heat (energy) required to raise the temperature of 1 gram (g) of water 1 degree Celsius (°C). You can fi nd information about the amount of <b>Calories</b> in <b>a</b> food on the Nutrition Facts panel. For example, the Nutrition Facts panel below shows that this food contains 250 Calories. The label also shows how many grams of fat, carbohydrates, and protein it contains. These components contribute different amounts of Calories to the overall food product. Here is how many <b>Calories</b> are in <b>a</b> gram of each: 1 g fat = 9 Calories 1 g carbohydrate = 4 Calories 1 g protein = 4 Calories To determine the amount of <b>Calories</b> in <b>a</b> food, nutrition and food scientists can use an instrument that is called a calorimeter.

500|$|On May 20, 2016 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{announced}} {{changes to}} the Nutrition Facts panel displayed on all foods, to be effective by July 2018. New to the panel is a requirement to list [...] "Added sugars" [...] by weight and {{as a percent of}} Daily Value (DV). For vitamins and minerals the intent of DVs is to indicate how much should be consumed. For added sugars, the guidance is that 100% DV should not be exceeded. 100% DV is defined as 50 grams. For a person consuming 2000 <b>calories</b> <b>a</b> day, 50 grams, the amount to not exceed, is the same as 200 calories, and thus 10% of total calories - same guidance as the World Health Organization. To put this into context, most 12 ounce (335 mL) cans of soda contain 39 grams of sugar. In the United States, a recently published government survey on food consumption reported that for men and women ages 20 and older the average total sugar intakes - naturally occurring in foods and added - were, respectively, 125 and 99 g/day.|$|E
500|$|Portman and Kunis started {{training}} {{six months}} before the start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers. Portman worked out for five hours a day, doing ballet, cross-training, and swimming. A few months closer to filming, she began choreography training. Kunis engaged in cardio and Pilates, [...] "train seven days a week, five hours, for five, six months total, and ... was put on a very strict diet of 1,200 <b>calories</b> <b>a</b> day." [...] She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds, and reported that Portman [...] "became smaller than I did." [...] Kunis said, [...] "I did ballet as a kid like every other kid does ballet. You wear a tutu and you stand on stage and you look cute and twirl. But this is very different because you can't fake it. You can't just stay in there and like pretend you know what you're doing. Your whole body has to be structured differently." [...] Georgina Parkinson, a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), coached the actors in ballet. ABT soloists Sarah Lane and Maria Riccetto served as [...] "dance doubles" [...] for Portman and Kunis respectively. Dancer Kimberly Prosa also served as a double for Portman. She stated: [...] "Natalie took class, she studied for several months, from the waist up is her. Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT, did the heavy tricks, she did the fouettés, but they only had her for a limited time, a couple of weeks, so I did the rest of whatever dance shots they needed." ...|$|E

Cavill is the first British and non-American actor to play the character. He was previously cast in , which was ultimately shelved, and was considered for the role in the 2006 film Superman Returns, but lost to Brandon Routh. Cavill stated, [...] "There's a very real story behind the Superman character." [...] He explained that everyone's goal has been to explore the difficulties his character faces as a result of having multiple identities – including his birth name, Kal-El, and his alter ego, Clark Kent. Cavill also stated that, [...] "He's alone and there's no one like him," [...] referring to Superman's vulnerabilities. [...] "That must be incredibly scary and lonely, not to know who you are or what you are, and {{trying to find out what}} makes sense. Where's your baseline? What do you draw from? Where do you draw a limit with the power you have? In itself, that's an incredible weakness." [...] In an interview with Total Film magazine, Cavill stated he had been consuming nearly 5,000 <b>calories</b> <b>a</b> day, training for over two hours daily and plowing protein to pack on the muscle mass. Joe Manganiello was considered for the role but could not work out an audition date for the casting director due to scheduling obligations with True Blood.
