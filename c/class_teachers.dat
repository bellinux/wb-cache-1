2500|$|Each class {{normally}} remains {{together as}} a cohort throughout their years, developing as a quasi-familial social group whose members know each other quite deeply.

The traditional goal was for the teacher to remain with a class for the eight years of the [...] "lower school" [...] cycle, but in recent years the duration of these cycles has been increasingly treated flexibly. Already in first grade, specialized teachers teach many of the subjects, including music, crafts, movement, and two foreign languages from complementary language families (in English-speaking countries often German and either Spanish or French); these subjects remain central to the curriculum throughout the elementary school years.|$|E
