25|$|The express tracks {{north of}} the station spread out to pass around a <b>crossunder</b> in the Times Square shuttle platforms. This <b>crossunder</b> was sealed off in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The {{passageway}} to the IND Queens Boulevard Line is on {{the extreme}} {{north end of the}} northbound platform, with a <b>crossunder</b> to the southbound side.|$|E
25|$|The station {{features}} modern beige bricks {{over the}} original tiles, but the standard IRT-style mosaics remain intact. There is a <b>crossunder</b> {{at the extreme}} {{north end of the}} platforms with an elevator on each side and an escalator on the Brooklyn Bridge-bound side. A ceramic artwork called Tunnel Vision by Nina Yankowitz was installed here in 1989.|$|E

25|$|Grand Central–42nd Street is {{an express}} {{station on the}} IRT Lexington Avenue Line. It was {{also known as the}} Diagonal Station at time of construction, being {{oriented}} 45° from the street grid. It has two island platforms, four tracks, and includes a crossover and a <b>crossunder.</b> The columns and beams here are massive, in order to support part of Grand Central Terminal and the office towers next to it.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} two fare control areas at 73rd Street and two at 74th. The 74th Street {{mezzanine}} has a wooden floor with windscreen on the stairs, a booth, and a <b>crossunder,</b> with stairs {{to both the}} new station building and to {{the northeast corner of}} 74th Street and Roosevelt Avenue. The 73rd Street mezzanine contains wooden stair walls, no windows, and no booth (the booth being in the IND entrance at street level). The canopy at the west end is different, having been added later than the original canopy.|$|E
25|$|The center {{platform}} {{was first}} used in passenger service in 1959, but was originally built {{along with the other}} platforms. It served the purpose of a Spanish solution, allowing passengers to exit both sides of subway cars as the express trains would open the doors on both sides. Newer subway cars' door controls made it more difficult to open doors {{on both sides of the}} train simultaneously; thus this solution became impractical and the platform was closed on November 8, 1973. In 2007–2010, it was converted to a <b>crossunder</b> between the IRT side platforms. Large metal fences have been erected to keep people away from the edges.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{crossovers}} or <b>crossunders</b> {{to allow}} free transfers between directions. There is a closed newsstand {{that has been}} tiled over.|$|R
50|$|This {{station is}} very close to street level. As a result, the {{stations}} houses are adjacent to their respective platforms and there are no crossovers or <b>crossunders.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are no {{crossovers}} or <b>crossunders</b> {{to allow}} free transfers between directions. The platforms are column-less {{except at the}} fare control areas, where they are painted lime green.|$|R
25|$|This {{station and}} {{elevated}} structure are made entirely of concrete. There were green mosaics along the concrete platform walls reading “Smith–9th St” in white sans-serif lettering, which were replaced with laminated replicas during renovations. A {{close examination of}} the canopied area suggests windows existed in the past. These were covered {{for many years and}} are now open air with safety grates. The station house is on ground level {{on the north side of}} 9th Street between Smith Street and the Gowanus Canal. Inside, there is a turnstile bank, token booth, and three long escalators and one staircase going up to a landing, where three more long escalators and one staircase perpendicular for the first set go up to a <b>crossunder.</b> A single staircase then goes up to the western end of either platform.|$|E
2500|$|On January 22, 2007, the MTA {{opened a}} new {{entrance}} on {{the southeast corner of}} Maiden Lane and Broadway. Like the John Street entrance, it serves chiefly the northbound platform of the Fulton Street station. That month, construction began on creating an analogous entrance on Cortlandt Street, just across the street from Broadway, for the southbound platform. No <b>crossunder</b> or crossover was constructed to link the two platforms. These entrances would allow for the temporary closure of the John Street entrance (northbound platform) and the entrance by Dey Street (southbound platform) during the rehabilitation of the [...] platforms and Dey Street Passageway related work.|$|E
2500|$|The {{south end}} of the {{northbound}} platform divides into two [...] "legs." [...] Two normally-unused tracks connect the Canarsie and Jamaica lines. Occasionally, a train being rerouted will use these tracks. The southbound track can be seen emerging beneath the two [...] "legs" [...] of the northbound platform; the northbound [...] "flyover" [...] with its severe curve can be seen just east of the station, beginning near the signal tower. Since 1999, this station has been undergoing a series of renovations, including new canopies, a new crossover (known as 'The Barn' because of its rustic red siding and white trim), and the removal of a hazardous <b>crossunder.</b> The old-style platform lights were removed and replaced with [...] "loop" [...] fixtures, widely seen elsewhere in the system.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{crossovers}} or <b>crossunders</b> {{to allow}} free transfers between directions. The southbound platform has a green fiberglass bucket seat bench {{built in the}} extended area in the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|There are no {{crossovers}} or <b>crossunders</b> {{between the}} two platforms. As a result, this station and 135th Street {{are the only two}} on the Eighth Avenue Line north of 59th Street that do not permit free transfers between opposite directions.|$|R
50|$|The {{platforms}} {{have low}} tubular fencing along their extreme ends and a wooden canopy {{held up by}} metal posts toward their midsection. Each platform has its own entrance/exit to {{the west side of}} Frank E. Rogers Boulevard and there are no crossovers or <b>crossunders.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Temporary {{transfer}} passages {{opened to}} the [...] trains from the [...] Mezzanine on October 29, 2011, this was done {{in conjunction with the}} closing of the entrance across the street on Fulton Street. A temporary entrance was opened {{in the middle of the}} Fulton Building worksite, on Broadway between John and Fulton Streets. A temporary transfer passage ran underneath Dey Street and led to the middle of the southbound [...] platform, situated near the site of the future Dey Street Headhouse and passageway. In June 2012, this passageway was again replaced, this time by a permanent passageway underneath Fulton Street that adjoins the [...] Mezzanine (Western section) directly. The original temporary transfer passageway would be part of an underground concourse connecting the Fulton Center and the Dey Street Passageway. It will also serve as a <b>crossunder</b> for the two platforms.|$|E
50|$|The express tracks {{north of}} the station spread out to pass around a <b>crossunder</b> in the Times Square shuttle platforms. This <b>crossunder</b> was sealed off in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} two side {{platforms}} and four tracks with no crossover or <b>crossunder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Both {{platforms}} has a fare control, {{and both}} areas have a turnstile bank, and four staircases to the street. The northbound side {{leads to the}} east side of Lexington Avenue while the southbound side leads to the west side. There are no crossovers or <b>crossunders</b> to allow free transfers between directions.|$|R
50|$|Each {{platform}} has one fare {{control area}} one block apart {{from each other}} and there are no crossovers or <b>crossunders</b> to allow free transfers between directions. The one on the Manhattan-bound side, located on platform level, has a turnstile bank, token booth, and one staircase going up to the northeast corner of Winthrop Street and Nostrand Avenue.|$|R
50|$|Both {{platforms}} have same-level fare control {{containing a}} bank of turnstiles, token booth, and staircases to the street. The northbound platform has two staircases (one to each eastern corner of Broadway and 145th Street) and the southbound platform has a single staircase to the northwestern corner. There are no crossovers or <b>crossunders</b> to allow transfers between directions.|$|R
50|$|There is a <b>crossunder</b> about midway {{along the}} length of the platforms, and a lesser-used one at the north end.|$|E
50|$|The north exit {{leads to}} 85th street {{and has a}} <b>crossunder.</b> The south exit, which leads to Forest Parkway, is closed.|$|E
50|$|The {{passageway}} to the IND Queens Boulevard Line is on {{the extreme}} {{north end of the}} northbound platform, with a <b>crossunder</b> to the southbound side.|$|E
50|$|Each {{platform}} has separate fare controls, {{and there}} are no crossovers or <b>crossunders</b> allowing free transfers between directions. The only entrance to the southbound platform is at the north-west corner of 110th Street and Broadway; there are entrances to the northbound platform from both the north-eastern and south-eastern corners of 110th Street and Broadway. There is a newsstand on the southbound platform.|$|R
50|$|Each {{platform}} has one same-level fare {{control area}} at the center. Each one has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the southbound platform go up to either western corners of Lexington Avenue and 110th Street while {{the ones on the}} northbound platform go up to either eastern corners. There are no crossovers or <b>crossunders</b> to allow a free transfer between directions.|$|R
50|$|Each {{platform}} has one same-level fare {{control area}} in their center {{and there are}} no <b>crossunders</b> or crossovers. The northbound platform has the station's full-time turnstile bank and token booth and two staircases going to either eastern corners of 23rd Street and Seventh Avenue. The southbound platform has an unstaffed set of turnstiles and two staircases going up to either western corners of the same intersection.|$|R
50|$|It has old style signs {{painted over}} and covered {{up with new}} style signs, and {{features}} new fare control railings as a <b>crossunder.</b> The station has three tracks with two side platforms.|$|E
50|$|For {{a time in}} {{the early}} 1960s, a false wall was {{installed}} to seal the ramp to the Nevins Street lower level. The false wall was taken down at a later date for unknown reasons. The Nevins Street lower level platform had, over the years, become a storage area for various work projects, and until Nevins Street was renovated, the rest of the lower platform was visible from the <b>crossunder.</b> A permanent tile wall now blocks off the lower platform, access to which is via a cellar-type door {{at the north end of}} each platform, as well as doors from the <b>crossunder.</b>|$|E
50|$|This station's only exit is via {{a wooden}} {{mezzanine}} under the tracks. The mezzanine has a <b>crossunder</b> and metal canopies. Outside fare control, stairs {{go to the}} northwest and southeast corners of Livonia and Rockaway Avenues.|$|E
50|$|Both {{platforms}} {{have one}} same-level fare control {{area at the}} center. Each one has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs.

The Manhattan-bound side has two street stairs to the east sidewalk of Fourth Avenue near the Prospect Expressway, while the Bay Ridge-bound side has one to the west sidewalk. There are no crossovers or <b>crossunders</b> to allow free transfer between directions.|$|R
50|$|Each {{platform}} has one same-level fare {{control area}} near the middle. Both are fully staffed, containing a turnstile bank and token booth, and each has two street stairs. The northbound side's two exits lead to {{the southeast corner of}} 157th Street and Broadway, and the southbound side's two exits lead to the northwest corner of the aforementioned intersection.
