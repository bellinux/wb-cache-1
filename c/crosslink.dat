5|$|Translesion {{synthesis}} (TLS) is a DNA {{damage tolerance}} process {{that allows the}} DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as thymine dimers or AP sites. It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V, from the Y Polymerase family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching {{is thought to be}} mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication processivity factor PCNA. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, Pol η mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation, whereas Pol ι introduces mutations at these sites. Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the T^T photodimer using Watson-Crick base pairing and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using Hoogsteen base pairing. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand <b>crosslink,</b> GT, although can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations. Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in Escherichia coli by replicating a GT-modified plasmid in E. coli with specific DNA polymerase knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II, pol IV, and pol V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases.|$|E

25|$|Mammalian cells {{carrying}} {{mutations in}} ERCC1 or XPF are especially sensitive to agents that cause DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL) Interstrand crosslinks block {{the progression of}} DNA replication, and structures at blocked DNA replication forks provide substrates for cleavage by ERCC1-XPF. Incisions may be made {{on either side of}} the <b>crosslink</b> on one DNA strand to unhook the <b>crosslink</b> and initiate repair. Alternatively, a double-strand break may be made in the DNA near the ICL, and subsequent homologous recombination repair my involve ERCC1-XPF action. Although not the only nuclease involved, ERCC1–XPF is required for ICL repair during several phases of the cell cycle.|$|E

The effect of the method of <b>crosslinking</b> {{and the use of}} different <b>crosslinking</b> agents were studied. The extracted gelatin was <b>crosslinked</b> either by immersion of preformed films into a crosslinker solution (Method A) or by the addition of the <b>crosslinking</b> reagent to the gelatin solution prior to film formation (Method B). The different results obtained between both methods may be due to: the relative concentration of <b>crosslinking</b> reagent, the introduction of <b>crosslinks</b> within different regions of gelatin (triple helical regions and random coil regions), and the reaction rate. Method A of <b>crosslinking</b> is more likely to form <b>crosslinks</b> outside but close to the triple helical regions, disrupting the order and stability of the helical structure. <b>Crosslinks</b> may form preferentially within the random coil regions when Method B of <b>crosslinking</b> is used.

25|$|Alkylating {{agents are}} the oldest group of {{chemotherapeutics}} in use today. Originally derived from mustard gas used in World War I, {{there are now}} many types of alkylating agents in use. They are so named because {{of their ability to}} alkylate many molecules, including proteins, RNA and DNA. This ability to bind covalently to DNA via their alkyl group is the primary cause for their anti-cancer effects. DNA is made of two strands and the molecules may either bind twice to one strand of DNA (intrastrand <b>crosslink)</b> or may bind once to both strands (interstrand <b>crosslink).</b> If the cell tries to replicate crosslinked DNA during cell division, or tries to repair it, the DNA strands can break. This leads to a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Alkylating agents will work at any point in the cell cycle and thus are known as cell cycle-independent drugs. For this reason the effect on the cell is dose dependent; the fraction of cells that die is directly proportional to the dose of drug.|$|E

Thrombin has a large array of functions, not only the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the building block of a hemostatic plug. In addition, {{it is the most}} important platelet activator {{and on top of that}} it activates Factors VIII and V and their inhibitor protein C (in the presence of thrombomodulin), and it activates Factor XIII, which forms covalent bonds that <b>crosslink</b> the fibrin polymers that form from activated monomers.|$|E

25|$|Irradiation <b>crosslinking</b> (PE-Xc): The <b>crosslinking</b> of {{polyethylene}} is {{also possible}} by a downstream radiation source (usually a electron accelerator, occasionally a isotopic radiator).

500|$|Since protein {{structure}} was so poorly {{understood in the}} 1930s, the physical interactions responsible for stabilizing that structure were likewise unknown. [...] Astbury hypothesized that the structure of fibrous proteins was stabilized by hydrogen bonds in β-sheets. [...] The idea that globular proteins are also stabilized by hydrogen bonds was proposed by Dorothy Jordan Lloyd in 1932, and championed later by Alfred Mirsky and Linus Pauling. [...] At a 1933 lecture by Astbury to the Oxford Junior Scientific Society, physicist Frederick Frank suggested that the fibrous protein α-keratin might be stabilized by an alternative mechanism, namely, covalent crosslinking of the peptide bonds by the cyclol reaction above. [...] The cyclol <b>crosslink</b> draws the two peptide groups close together; the N and C atoms are separated by ~1.5Å, whereas they are separated by ~3Å in a typical hydrogen bond.

500|$|The most {{striking}} {{outcomes of the}} analysis of Kinesin-5 motility {{is that it is}} slow – about 10 times slower than conventional Kinesin-1 – with a velocity in the range of 50 nanometers per second and that it could generate very high levels of mechanical force (7-9 picoNewtons per molecule). [...] These values come from three types of experimental data: microtubule gliding assays, single molecule motility assays, and optical trap assays. In microtubule gliding assays, kinesins are attached to a glass surface and microtubules are laid down over the top. [...] Since the motors are attached to the glass, their motile behavior translates into movement of the microtubule across the anchored kinesins, akin to someone crowd surfing. [...] These experiments gave us the first analysis of Kinesin-5 motility. [...] By attaching microtubules to the glass surface first, then adding Kinesin-5 with free microtubules in solution, it was possible to adapt the microtubule gliding assays to show that Kinesin-5 can <b>crosslink</b> two microtubules and move them in opposite directions. [...] This experiment showed that Kinesin-5 was indeed capable of carrying out the role that had been proposed for it in mitosis – sliding oppositely oriented microtubules in the mitotic spindle. [...] To study the behavior of individual Kinesin-5 molecules, single molecule motility assays were performed by attaching microtubules to a glass surface, then adding a dilute solution of Kinesin-5 with a fluorophore attached. [...] This experimental setup enables the observer to follow separate Kinesin-5 molecules as they “walk” along the microtubule, providing not only information about velocity, but also about processivity – the ability of a kinesin to take multiple steps along the microtubule without dissociating. [...] In single molecule motility assays, velocities for Kinesin-5 were similar to those seen in microtubule gliding assays, and the motor was observed to be weakly processive. In optical trap experiments, Kinesin-5 molecules are attached to a bead that can be held in place by a finely focused laser. [...] By moving the bead close to a microtubule, the kinesin can bind to the microtubule and begin stepping, pulling the bead along behind it. [...] Since the bead is being held in place by the trap laser, it acts like a spring and exerts a force that resists the forward movement of the kinesin. [...] This allows for the measurement of the stall force – the maximum amount of force that can be exerted by a motor before it releases from the microtubule. [...] Optical trap experiments showed that Kinesin-5 generates a maximum of 7 picoNewtons of force before releasing, but that its behavior differs from that of other kinesins in that there was no observable plateau phase in which the motor “struggles” at its maximal force generation before letting go. [...] Extrapolation of kinetic data suggests that the maximal observed force generated in the optical trap by Kinesin-5 is actually an underestimate and that it theoretically can exert up to 9 picoNewtons of force as a maximum, although further experimental work is required to test this.|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} on thermostabilization of enzymes in {{solution}} by intramolecular <b>crosslinking</b> of the specific functional groups within an enzyme molecule. Three model enzymes were used: α-amylase of Aspergillus oryzae (EC 3. 2. 1. 1), β-galactosidase of Aspergillus oryzae (EC 3. 2. 1. 23) and extracellular invertase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. <b>Crosslinking</b> was examined using the following homobifunctional reagents: diisocyanates (O=C=N(CH 2) nN=C=O, n = 4, 6, 8), diimidoesters (CH 3 O(=NH) C(CH 2) nC(=NH) OCH 3, n = 4, 5, 6) and diamines (NH 2 (CH 2) nNH 2, n = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12). The concentration of the enzymes was kept low at 0. 9 μM in attempts to promote intramolecular <b>crosslinking</b> as opposed to intermolecular <b>crosslinking.</b> Only invertase could be stabilized relative to controls by <b>crosslinking</b> with diisocyanates. Invertase (0. 9 μM) <b>crosslinked</b> with 1, 4 -diisocyanatobutane (n = 4; or butamethylene diisocyanate, BMDC) and 1, 6 -diisocyanatohexane (n = 6) showed enhanced thermostability. Stability was improved dramatically by <b>crosslinking</b> invertase with 20 - 30 μM of the reagent. Molecular engineering of invertase by <b>crosslinking</b> reduced its first-order thermal denaturation constant at 60 °C from 1. 232 min- 1 for the native enzyme to 0. 831 min- 1 for the stabilized enzyme. Similarly, the best <b>crosslinking</b> treatment increased the activation energy for thermal denaturation from 372 kJ mol- 1 for the native invertase to 517 kJ mol- 1 for the stabilized enzyme. Values of the Michaelis- Menten parameters (Km and νmax) showed a reduced efficiency of invertase after the <b>crosslinking</b> treatment. The nature of the <b>crosslinking</b> was examined using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and multiple angle laser light scattering (MALLS). Depending on the conditions used, both intermolecular and intramolecular <b>crosslinking</b> occurred. The estimated molecular weight of the intermolecularly <b>crosslinked</b> invertase appeared to be much higher compared to the intramolecularly <b>crosslinked</b> invertase and the native invertase. In attempts to simplify certain analyses, {{attempts were made to}} remove the carbohydrate moiety from <b>crosslinked</b> invertase (a glycoprotein) molecule. Deglycosylation with PNGase F achieved a significant reduction of carbohydrate for the native invertase but not for the intra- and intermolecularly <b>crosslinked</b> invertase. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements showed that <b>crosslinking</b> with BMDC affected slightly the secondary structure of invertase. The nature of the <b>crosslinking</b> that might be occurring in invertase molecule was further studied using small model oligopeptides, small nonglycosylated enzymes (hen egg white lysozyme and pepsin) and glycoprotein models (ovalbumin). <b>Crosslinking</b> of the model pentapeptide (0. 9 μM) suggested that <b>crosslinking</b> with BMDC involved reaction between BMDC and the amino group of lysine or the carboxylate at C-terminal of the pentapeptide. Using a heptapeptide (1 mM) in <b>crosslinking</b> with BMDC showed a changed hydrophobicity of the <b>crosslinked</b> peptide. The <b>crosslinking</b> treatment of lysozyme (3. 5 mM) with BMDC clearly produced an intermolecularly <b>crosslinked</b> lysozyme as evidenced by SEC and SDS-PAGE. A changed net charge of lysozyme after the <b>crosslinking</b> treatment was demonstrated using native PAGE. Mass spectrometry was used to then prove the intramolecular <b>crosslinking</b> of lysozyme with BMDC.
