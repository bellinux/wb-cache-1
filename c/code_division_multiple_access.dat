This scrambling is removed at the receiver after demodulation. When the LFSR runs at the same bit rate as the transmitted symbol stream, this technique {{is referred to as}} scrambling. When the LFSR runs considerably faster than the symbol stream, the LFSR-generated bit sequence is called chipping code. The chipping code is combined with the data using exclusive or before transmitting using binary phase-shift keying or a similar modulation method. The resulting signal has a higher bandwidth than the data, and therefore this is a method of spread-spectrum communication.

However, there is only limited research on the admission control for CDMA systems containing multiple service classes. In this paper the multi-service CDMA admission control problem is addressed by an approach which is conceptually simple, and yet produces satisfactory results. In our approach the limit on the acceptable interference level in a cell is translated into a constraint on the number of users of each service class in the local and neighboring cells. The randomness of user locations, shadowing and imperfect power control is captured as a whole by a log-normal distribution. Simulation results show that this approach is quite accurate over a wide range of required system outage probabilities. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
