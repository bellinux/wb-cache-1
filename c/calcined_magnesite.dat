Don with magnesium deficiency in Tauhara Forest in the central North Island of New Zealand. The main trial consisted of rates of dolomite applied at 0, 20, 55, 150, and 400 kg Mg/ha. A range of magnesium fertilisers (kieserite, serpentine, coarse-ground <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite,</b> fine-ground <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite,</b> and Epsom salts) was also applied at 55 kg Mg/ha.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to apply metakaolin from northeast of Thailand as a binder in the casting process of rice polishing cylinder in replacement of the imported <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite</b> cement and to reduce the production cost of the cylinder. Metakaolin was obtained from three different regions (Udon Thani, Nakhon Phanom, and Ubon Ratchathani). The design of experiment analysis using the MINITAB Release 14 based on the compressive strength and tensile strength testing was conducted.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The process {{developed}} in the U K to produce magnesium hydroxide from seawater is described, together with the heat reatment that he hydroxide r ceives toproduce the active oxide. Some of the characteristics required of the dolomite used in the process are also discussed. Impurities introduced by the seawater a e noted and {{the means by which}} they can be reduced explained. Magnesium oxide has long been an important industrial material. The major tonnage outlet for magnesia has been the refractories industry in which it is employed as 'dead-burned' grain magnesite for the construction and maintenance of the hearths or bottoms of open-hearth steel furnaces. Magnesia also is used in the form of <b>calcined</b> refractory <b>magnesite</b> brick and as a chemical addition in the manufacture of chrome, olivine and other refractories. The industrial importance of magnesia is due to its chemical behaviour and this is largely determined by the position of magnesium in the periodic table. Magnesium oxide is a weak base, particularly at high temperatures, and therefore magnesium oxide is barely attacked by alkalis but readily by acids.

40|$|This thesis {{addressed}} {{the problem of}} the widespread occurrence of magnesium deficiency in Pinus. radiata planted on pumice soils in the central North Island of New Zealand, the increased severity of the deficiency where trees were planted on grassed sites, and the slow increase in foliar Mg concentrations and tree growth following fertilisation of deficient trees with various sources and rates of Mg fertiliser. Plant available Mg concentrations were found to be very low in pumice soils, with soil solution concentrations often below 1 mgL-¹, and exchangeable concentrations in the upper 20 cm of the soil normally well below 1 meq 100 g-¹. Published soil critical levels for a number of crops fall into the range of 0. 2 to 1. 0 meq 100 g-¹. Addition of between 100 and 400 kgha-¹ Mg (as Epsom salts, dolomite, or <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite)</b> in a laboratory study raised soil solution concentrations by between 8 and 37 mgL-¹ and exchangeable concentrations by between 1. 5 and 3. 4 meq 100 g-¹. These levels should be adequate for tree growth. Epsom salts caused a much greater increase in solution Mg concentration than either dolomite or <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite.</b> Changes in soil solution and exchangeable concentrations were monitored in a field experiment. Epsom salts and <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite</b> were added at 400 kgha-¹ Mg. The Epsom salts caused a large and rapid increase in solution Mg concentrations to a soil depth of at least 45 cm. <b>Calcined</b> <b>magnesite</b> had no significant effect on solution concentrations. Both treatments increased exchangeable Mg concentrations well above 1 meq 100 g-¹, although the less soluble <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite</b> was slower acting. Improvements in exchangeable Mg were still apparent after 18 months with concentrations of the order of 1. 5 meq 100 g-¹ in the upper 20 cm, although soil solution concentrations had returned to pre- fertilisation levels. The effects of Mg deficiency on dry matter allocation patterns were investigated in a glasshouse and a field experiment. Mg deficiency caused a 25 % decrease in root: shoot ratio in seedlings. In an 8 year old stand of trees, where above ground dimensions were the same, but foliar concentrations were above or below the critical level of 0. 07 % Mg, there was 50 % less fine root length in the deficient trees when compared to the healthy. This root decline could explain the slow response of fertilised trees, either due to a smaller exploitable soil volume, or due to a need to rebuild the root system before a response is detectable above ground. Two field experiments using 400 kgha-¹ Mg as Epsom salts were established, one in a newly planted area (Halls), and the other in an 8 year old Mg deficient P. radiata stand (Kiorenui). At this high rate foliar Mg concentrations were improved to well above 0. 1 % within six months of Mg application. This indicated that previous slow responses were likely to have been due to use of low rates or slowly soluble sources of Mg. No growth responses were recorded in either trial, the juvenile trees were only marginally deficient by age 3, and the older trees were measured only six months after fertiliser application. Foliage analysis and tests with a total spectrum fertiliser indicated no other elements were deficient in either of the field experiments. The effect of grass on tree growth and Mg uptake was tested at Halls in the juvenile trees. Removal of grass competition caused a 30 % improvement in tree biomass at age 3, 18 months after treatments were applied. Grass competition intensified the Mg deficiency in the trees and if trees were fertilised without grass control, tree growth was slightly suppressed due to stimulation of the grass. It was suggested that this was an effect on the soil moisture conditions and hence nutrient uptake rather than a direct effect of the grass in competition for Mg. The Barber-Cushman nutrient uptake model was used for a sensitivity analysis of parameters affecting Mg uptake on the newly planted site. This showed that root growth and Mg influx parameters were most important on this site, suggesting that Mg supply was not limiting growth, a conclusion supported by the fertiliser experiment results. Calculation of Mass Flow Coefficients indicated that far more Mg would be supplied to the root than would be assimilated by the tree. Calculation of Mass Flow Coefficients from published data for an age range of P. radiata up to age 12 showed that on a site with low soil solution Mg concentration (0. 3 - 0. 5 mgL-¹), once the trees were older than 3 years the proportion of Mg supplied to the root by diffusion increased until by age 5 approximately 75 % would be supplied by that means. The importance of soil diffusion rates and soil moisture conditions will therefore be greater for older trees. A soil solution concentration of 1 - 2 mgL-¹ was calculated to be the level at which 100 % of Mg would be supplied by mass flow, and this could be used for identifying potentially deficient sites, Conclusions from this study, plus other published information on the topic were synthesised into a set of rules. These will be the basis of an expert system for managing the Mg nutrition of P. radiata...|$|E
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{leaching}} magnesium oxide by water containing CO 2, the obtained concentration is normally only 5 g/L to 12 g/L. To obtain concentrated magnesic leaching liquor from boron mud, pressurized dissolution processes were investigated under various CO 2 pressures from 1 MPa to 5 MPa, as well as ratios of solid to liquid, stirring speeds and leaching temperatures, which significantly influenced the leaching of magnesium oxide. And the concentration of MgO in the solution was achieved as high as 26. 63 g/L with MgO leaching efficiency of 38. 80 % under the condition of CO 2 pressure 5 MPa, solid/liquid ratio 0. 18, stirring speed 500 rpm, leaching temperature 50 degrees C, and leaching time 1. 5 h, meanwhile, the impurity concentrations of CaO, B, Fe, Pd and Si were 0. 16 g/L, 0. 11 g/L, 0. 23 g/L, 0. 01 g/L and 0. 06 g/L, respectively.

40|$|To {{improve the}} overall {{sustainability}} of MgO-based refractory production, a novel process to produce high purity MgO from calcined low-grade magnesite in ammonium chloride solution was developed. The process was designed {{on the basis}} of the phase equilibria of the NH 4 Cl-MgCl 2 -NH 3 -H 2 O system obtained using the Mixed Solvent Electrolyte model embedded in OLI software. The optimum calcination temperature of low-grade magnesite was determined to be 650 degrees C in terms of the conversion ratio of magnesium and calcium in the leaching experiments. An apparent activation energy of Mg extraction was 30. 98 kJ/mol, which is slightly lower than that of Ca leaching. An empirical kinetic model of magnesium extraction was also developed to describe the effects of NH 4 Cl concentration, particle size of <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite,</b> and solid-to-liquid ratio on the extent of extraction of magnesium. At leaching time of 10 min, the leachate with high Mg/Ca molar ratio was obtained.

40|$|Magnesium {{deficiency}} is {{of concern}} {{in a number of}} forest regions in New Zealand and has been linked in recent years to a condition in Pinus radiata called upper mid crown yellowing (UMCY). Magnesium deficiency is also acknowledged as a common nutrient disorder linked to 'new type forest decline' in Europe and the USA. With increases in the number of rotations and increased growth rates through tree breeding, the incidence of Mg deficiency and UMCY is expected to increase. This study investigated the Mg fertility of a range of forest soils, their responses to the application of Mg fertilisers and Mg uptake by P. radiata. New Zealand Forest Research (Institute Ltd) has established a series of Mg fertiliser trials (FR 190 series) in a range of forest soils. Five of these trial sites, located in the North Island of New Zealand, where <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite</b> (calmag) was applied at 150 kg Mg ha- 1, were sampled to investigate the effectiveness of calmag in increasing plant available Mg and to determine the fate of the fertiliser. At all of the sites, within two and three years following calmag application, both soil exchangeable Mg and solution Mg concentrations were increased in the top 5 cm. However, the increases were significant only at three of the sites, where the initial soil exchangeable Mg was low. The other two soils had medium to high concentrations of soil exchangeable Mg prior to Mg fertiliser application. Between 70 - 90 % of the applied fertiliser Mg had dissolved and estimated losses due to leaching ranged from 0 - 20 %. Foliar concentrations of Mg were generally improved in the fertilised trees, but the increases were not significant. Symptoms of Mg deficiency and UMCY are worse in trees that have high foliar K:Mg ratios. High foliar K:Mg ratios reflect changes in the pools of soil exchangeable Mg and K. Therefore, the effects of Mg fertiliser application on soil K:Mg molar ratios at the FR 190 series trials were examined. In the trials where Mg fertiliser application significantly increased soil exchangeable Mg the soil K:Mg molar ratio was significantly reduced. This could see a reversal of the trend of the soil K:Mg ratios increasing with time and a reduction in the severity of Mg and UMCY symptoms. In the trials that had medium to high concentrations of Mg, the K:Mg molar ratio was not affected by increases in exchangeable Mg from Mg fertiliser application. As there are several Mg fertilisers with varied solubilities available to foresters a study was conducted to determine the rates of dissolution of a range of Mg fertilisers applied at 200 kg Mg ha- 1 to a pumice soil under P. radiata in Kaingaroa Forest near Rotorua. Twenty seven months after fertiliser application the mean percentage of Mg dissolved were 100 % for Epsom salts, 92 % for <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite</b> 1 - 2 mm, 91 % for Granmag 20 (granulated product from 20 % acidulation of <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite,</b> 2 - 4 mm), 83 % for <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite</b> 2 - 4 mm and 70 % for forestry grade dolomite. The specific dissolution rate constants (µg fertiliser cm- 2 day- 1) for the slowly soluble Mg fertilisers were 279 for <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite</b> 1 - 2 mm, 220 for <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesite</b> 2 - 4 mm, 212 for Granmag 20 and 13 for forestry grade dolomite. A computer program based on an elemental sulfur (Sº) oxidation model, where the rate of Sº oxidation depends on surface area of the particles, explained the rate of dissolution of Mg fertilisers within a narrow fertiliser particle size range. Application of Mg fertiliser has been shown to increase plant-available Mg. However, there has been no significant increase in foliar Mg concentrations in the fertilised trees. It was thought that though the bulk soil had sufficient plant-available Mg, some factors in the rhizosphere might be inhibiting Mg uptake by P. radiata. Therefore, trials were conducted to increase the understanding of Mg availability in the soil immediately surrounding the tree roots. Two glasshouse experiments were conducted investigating the tree-induced changes in Mg availability in the rhizosphere of P. radiata seedlings. The first used pumice topsoil fertilised with various forms of Mg fertilisers. The second used pumice sub-soil that had lower exchangeable Mg concentrations and pH buffering capacity. The subsoil was fertilised with different rates of Mg and K fertilisers. There was a significant accumulation of exchangeable Mg in the soil layers near the rhizosplane, compared to the bulk soil for the Epsom salts and granmag fertiliser treatments in the first experiment. A similar accumulation occurred for treatments where Mg fertiliser was applied in the second experiment. Magnesium accumulation at the root surface is probably due to a higher rate of Mg movement by mass-flow compared to Mg uptake by the seedlings. The higher rate of Mg movement was probably caused by high seedling transpiration rates. Magnesium accumulation in the rhizosphere could have also been influenced by ectomycorrhizal fungi growth. Soil pH in the rhizosphere soil of the first experiment was generally unaffected by nutrient uptake of the seedling compared to the bulk soil, probably due to the high buffering capacity of this soil. Whereas, in the second experiment the soil pH, because of the low pH buffering capacity of the soil, was significantly reduced in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk in all treatments. Cation-anion balance without considering N uptake, showed that the seedlings took up an excess of cations compared to anions. Because the ionic form of N taken up by the seedlings was not determined, {{it was not possible to}} explain the rhizosphere acidification from the cation-anion balance in the seedlings. Magnesium concentrations in the fertilised seedling in the first experiment increased for all fertiliser types used, but only the increases in root Mg concentrations were significant. In the second experiment Mg fertiliser application significantly increased Mg concentrations in both the shoots and roots. Recently, Forest Research installed a fertiliser trial that manipulated the soil K:Mg ratio through the application of Mg and K fertiliser. This trial was used to study the losses of Mg due to leaching under P. radiata after the application of Mg and K fertiliser. Suction cup lysimeters were installed at 2 depths (10 cm and 45 cm) to monitor changes in soil solution Mg concentrations in the top-soil where the active roots are and the leaching losses of Mg down below 45 cm over an 18 month period after fertiliser application. Magnesium and K fertiliser application resulted in significant increases in soil solution Mg and K concentrations in the 0 - 10 cm soil layer soon after fertiliser application. However, by 90 to 180 days after application concentrations have returned to levels not significantly different from those of the control treatment. The soil solution K:Mg molar ratio in the 0 - 10 cm soil layer was significantly increased by both K fertiliser treatments at all sampling times. Magnesium fertiliser application generally decreased the soil solution K:Mg molar ratio, although none of the decreases were significant. Magnesium fertiliser application significantly decreased the soil exchangeable K:Mg molar ratio and K fertiliser application significantly increased the soil exchangeable K:Mg molar ratio. Between 180 to 240 days following application, concentrations of Mg and K in the sub soil lysimeters peaked. Concentrations of solution Mg in the sub soil lysimeters of the fertilised and unfertilised plots were generally greater than solution K concentrations. Estimated leaching losses of Mg were 39. 4 kg Mg ha- 1 in the Mg fertilised plots and 11. 2 to 26. 9 kg Mg ha- 1 in the K fertilised plots. Estimated leaching losses of K were 8. 9 kg K ha- 1 for the 200 kg K ha- 1 treated plots and 17. 4 kg K ha- 1 for the 400 kg K ha- 1 treated plots. Magnesium fertiliser application did not cause any increase in the leaching losses of K. This thesis has increased the knowledge base of the Mg fertility of a range of forest soils and their response to application of Mg fertiliser. More research is required to determine the reasons for the slow tree response to increases in soil Mg from Mg fertiliser application and the role of ectomycorrhizal in the Mg uptake by P. radiata...|$|E
