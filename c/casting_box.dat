Usually sand-molded, cores are inserted into the <b>casting</b> <b>box</b> after removal of the pattern.

5000|$|Invented in Lyon in 1829 by the French printer Claude Genoux, a flong was a papier-mâché mould {{made with}} the aid of heat and {{pressure}} of a set [...] of type. After placing it in a <b>casting</b> <b>box,</b> a thin replica of the original (metal) type (and illustrations) would be cast against it all in one piece. A limited number of duplicate casts could be made from one flong. The back shaved stereo plate would be attached to a press cylinder or honeycomb base and allow the original undamaged type to be distributed or recycled. The stereotypes could be stored for repeat editions in much less space than standing forms.|$|E
5000|$|He also {{developed}} a method for casting pots in 'greensand' moulds, previously only used for smaller castings. This enabled pots to be mass-produced and to be thinner than those made by the traditional process of casting in loam moulds. For this purpose, he established the Cheese Lane Foundry in 1704. Initially he cast brass pots, but by 1705, {{he moved on to}} using iron. [...] A young Welsh apprentice, John Thomas, solved the problem by using sand for the mould, with a special <b>casting</b> <b>box</b> and core. Using this casting method Darby could cast pots of sufficient thinness and lightness. Darby took out a patent on the new casting method in 1707, [...] Darby's successors sold pots over wide areas of England and Wales, and had a virtual monopoly in the trade. [...] For this he used a reverberatory air furnace of a kind developed by Sir Clement Clerke, initially for smelting lead near Bristol, and applied by him or his son Talbot to iron founding at Vauxhall.|$|E

The results show that the weight of the <b>casting</b> lower <b>box</b> after optimization is 22. 95 % lower than that of the experience design, and the weight of the welding part is 19. 09 % lower than that.
