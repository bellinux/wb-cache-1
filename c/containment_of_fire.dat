40|$|A {{computational}} {{approach for}} identifying efficient fuel breaks partitions for the <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> incidents in forests is proposed. The approach {{is based on}} the complex networks statistics, namely the centrality measures and cellular automata modeling. The efficiency of various centrality statistics, such as betweenness, closeness, Bonacich and eigenvalue centrality to select fuel breaks partitions vs. the random-based distribution is demonstrated. Two examples of increasing complexity are considered: (a) an artificial forest of randomly distributed density of vegetation, and (b) a patch from the area of Vesuvio, National Park of Campania, Italy. Both cases assume flat terrain and single type of vegetation. Simulation results over an ensemble of lattice realizations and runs show that the proposed approach appears very promising as it produces statistically significant better outcomes when compared to the random distribution approach...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt is {{observed}} {{that in many}} civil structures, passive fire protection requirement is arrived at by prescriptive methods recommended by National Building Code (NBC) or Indian Standards rather than analyzing from fire safety point of view using standard technique like Fire Hazard Analysis (FHA). FHA helps in analyzing the fire hazard aspects in terms of possible fire scenarios, consequences of fire deterministically/probabilistically; judges the adequacy of fire protection for prevention, detection, suppression, extinction and <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and its effects. It {{is observed}} that almost in all cases of fire protection of civil structures, the resources are not properly used nor safety is assessed {{in the way it}} should be. Improper resource utilization results in environmental concern besides the economic aspect of a project. This paper discusses the passive fire protection measures for civil structures from FHA point of view with outcome derived from fire dynamics simulation and suggests the changes required to be made in regulatory requirement in the context of passive fire protection for civil structures, in particular. It also emphasizes the need of FHA for arriving at the fire barrier ratings of fire barriers/walls...|$|E
40|$|Quick {{evacuation}} of passengers and <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> growth in an airplane cabin {{play an important role}} in ensuring passengers ' survivability in case of a fire aboard an airplane. The use of thermostable (heat-resistant) materials is capable of solving this problem, however, high cost of such materials limits their wide employment. One of the fields for the heat-resistant materials application is the inflatable of the emergency evacuation slide, which has large internal volume and is inflated by pyrotechnic inflation system. Below are shown the results of tests, aimed at determining heat release rates of existing Russian- and foreign-manufactured materials of emergency evacuation slides. Also there are show the results of tests new materials, based on para-aramid (Armos®), polyimide (Arimid®), and newly developed para-metaaramid (Tverlana®) fibers, created by experts from the All-Russian Scientific-Research Institute of Polymeric Fibers, and which are coated with airtight coatings similar to the ones used in Russian emergency evacuation slides. The use of Arimid ® heat-resistant textile material, featuring a high heat-resistance combined with a fluorine rubber coating, allows better test results with a lower heat release to be achieved. On our opinion, the new Tverlana ® para-metaaramid fiber is the most suitable material for manufacturing inflatable tubes of emergency evacuation slides, since it has the best combination of cost-efficiency and physical propertys...|$|E

40|$|The Firefighter Problem was {{proposed}} in 1995 [16] as a deterministic discrete-time {{model for the}} spread (and <b>containment)</b> <b>of</b> a <b>fire.</b> Its applications reach from real fires to the spreading of deseases and the <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> floods.

Such a context seems very appropriate when applied to large networks, where entities may act and make decisions based on their own interests, without global coordination. We model the Firefighter Problem as a strategic game where there is one player for each time step who decides where to place the firefighters. We show that the Price of Anarchy is linear in the general case, but at most 2 for trees. We prove that the quality of the equilibria improves when allowing coalitional cooperation among players. In general, we have that the Price of Anarchy is in O(n / k) where k is the coalition size.

Due to lower winds the next day, the fire decreased and became 70% contained, but it had already burned 70,900 acres of land and charred 35 homes.

50|$|The fire {{began at}} {{approximately}} 2:15 PM on June 24, 2007 near Seneca Pond, a small lake near Lake Tahoe {{and the town}} of Meyers. During that time, the region was experiencing extremely strong winds and low relative humidity, which fanned the fire and created an extremely rapid moving crown fire. Many neighborhoods were evacuated immediately, giving only very short warning to residents, sometimes as short as 5 minutes. In addition to the strong winds, the fire was also fuelled by unusually dry conditions in the Sierra Nevada (U.S.). A study concluded that snow pack was 29% of average in 2007.After an hour of burning, soot began to fall from the sky around the Tahoe Keys area. People flocked to head towards the source, but the firefighters blockaded the road near the high school. A day after the fire started, the state of California declared it a state of emergency, opening up state funds.

50|$|The New Jersey Forest Fire Service {{estimates}} (and anticipates) {{an average}} of 1,400 to 1,500 wildland fires that occur each year destroying approximately 7,000 acres within the state. <b>Of</b> these <b>fires,</b> 99% are either intentionally or accidentally caused by humans. Unlike wildfires in the Western United States which are more frequently caused by lightning strikes, only an estimated one percent of wildfires in New Jersey are caused by natural events such as lightning. Because of New Jersey's temperate climate, lightning storms or thunderstorms are typically accompanied by precipitation {{and as a result}} few fires are caused or able to spread. Human causes include: 17.8% caused by arson, 17.4% by children playing with matches or intentionally setting fires, 13.4% from regular equipment use (cars, power lines, lawn mowers, tractors), 7.5% by railroads (hot breaks, exhaust particles, equipment failure), 7% for smokers improperly discarding cigarettes, 7% from recreational campfires, and 5.7% from the illegal burning of debris. The remaining 24% are of miscellaneous or undermined causes, including fireworks and incendiary devices. Comparatively, in 1895, a report of the state geologist indicated that 49% <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> were caused by locomotive engines and railroads, 41% were accidental, with the remainder being either arson or miscellaneous causes. However, because of innovations in fire-fighting technology and through an aggressive policy combining observation, identification, and <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> wildland <b>fires,</b> New Jersey experienced a reduction in the damage caused by incidents through the course of the twentieth century.|$|R

BACKGROUND: In SECY- 03 - 0100, “Rulemaking Plan on Post-Fire Operator Manual Actions, ” dated June 17, 2003, the staff recommended revising the existing fire protection regulation in paragraph III. G. 2 of Appendix R to 10 CFR Part 50 to include operator manual actions. These actions are needed to ensure that a redundant train of systems necessary to achieve and maintain hot shutdown conditions located within the same area outside the primary <b>containment</b> is free <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> damage. In an SRM dated September 12, 2003, the Commission approved the staff’s recommendation to revise the fire protection program requirements in Appendix R and the associated guidance. The Commission also approved the staff’s plan to develop an interim enforcement policy to deal with compliance issues until the guidance and final rule are implemented. CONTACT...|$|R
