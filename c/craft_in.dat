5|$|For the German part, the High Seas Fleet {{determined}} not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines, and since submarines were more needed for commerce raiding, the fleet stayed in port {{for much of the}} remainder of the war. Other theatres showed the role of small <b>craft</b> <b>in</b> damaging or destroying dreadnoughts. The two Austrian dreadnoughts lost in November 1918 were casualties of Italian torpedo boats and frogmen.|$|E

The agency also advised small <b>craft</b> <b>in</b> Cuba and the Cayman Islands {{to remain at}} port. The depression was the first tropical cyclone threat to south Florida since Hurricane Andrew nine months prior, although officials noted the depression's winds were no cause for concern.|$|E

5|$|At 05:10, four German torpedo boats {{reached the}} Eastern Task Force and {{launched}} fifteen torpedoes, sinking the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS Svenner off Sword beach but missing the battleships HMS Warspite and Ramillies. After attacking, the German vessels {{turned away and}} fled east into a smoke screen that had been laid by the RAF to shield the fleet from the long-range battery at Le Havre. Allied losses to mines included USS Corry off Utah and USS PC-1261, a 173-foot patrol <b>craft.</b> <b>In</b> addition, many landing craft were lost.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War, remnants of the United States Asiatic Fleet fled to Australia, on orders from Washington. The S-boats from the Philippines were organized into a fighting force at Brisbane, and Admiral Ernest King ordered S-boats from the Atlantic Fleet to supplement the force in Australia. Christie went along, arriving in April 1942, {{just in time for the}} Battle of the Coral Sea. During the Solomon Islands campaign, he ordered his boats to patrol around harbors which, while being key points for shipping, also tended to be heavily patrolled by aircraft and anti-submarine <b>craft.</b> <b>In</b> step with then-current U.S. Navy submarine doctrine, he made capital ships the prime targets, rather than have his boats focus on merchant shipping.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{takes place}} in coastal towns, {{especially}} in Gampo-eup in the city's northeast, with 436 registered fishing <b>craft</b> <b>in</b> the city. Fishing industry in Gyeongju is generally in a declined status due to relatively inconvenient transport conditions and lacks of subordinate facilities. Much of the catch from these boats goes direct from the harbor to Gyeongju's many seafood restaurants. Mainly, sauries, anchovies, rays are harvested and {{a small number of}} abalone and wakame farming takes place. Local specialties include myeolchijeot (fermented anchovy), abalone, wakame, and squid.|$|E

5|$|From their {{beginnings}} to {{the present}} day, B movies have provided opportunities both for those {{coming up in the}} profession and others whose careers are waning. Celebrated filmmakers such as Anthony Mann and Jonathan Demme learned their <b>craft</b> <b>in</b> B movies. They are where actors such as John Wayne and Jack Nicholson first became established, and they have provided work for former A movie actors, such as Vincent Price and Karen Black. Some actors, such as Bela Lugosi, Eddie Constantine and Pam Grier, worked in B movies for most of their careers. The term B actor is sometimes used to refer to a performer who finds work primarily or exclusively in B pictures.|$|E
5|$|Iden Lock {{connected}} the Royal Military Canal to the river. The last commercial barge to pass from the Rother through Iden lock onto the canal was the Vulture, carrying 27 tons of shingle on 15 December 1909. After that, the lock {{was replaced by}} a sluice, severing the navigable connection. The river was used by pleasure <b>craft</b> <b>in</b> Edwardian times, when regular boat trips from Scots Float Sluice, then called Star Lock, to Bodiam Castle were offered. The lower river is currently used for moorings, and the Bodiam Ferry Company operate a trip boat from Newenden Bridge to Bodiam Castle.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{the test}} program was {{transferred}} to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test-flying duties. The HZ-1 had been designed to be very easy to fly, and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate the <b>craft</b> <b>in</b> less than 20 minutes, and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required. In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army. Sundby, however, quickly determined that the craft was {{much more difficult to}} fly than had been expected, and would not be safe {{in the hands of an}} inexperienced pilot. In addition, the low-mounted rotors proved to be prone to kicking up small rocks and other debris.|$|E

5|$|Storms of Category2 {{intensity}} often damage {{roofing material}} (sometimes exposing the roof) and inflict damage upon poorly constructed doors and windows. Poorly constructed signs and piers can receive considerable damage and many trees are uprooted or snapped. Mobile homes, whether anchored or not, are typically damaged and sometimes destroyed, and many manufactured homes also suffer structural damage. Small <b>craft</b> <b>in</b> unprotected anchorages may break their moorings. Extensive to near-total power outages and scattered loss of potable water are likely, possibly lasting many days.|$|E

BARB's boat house on the sea front was built in 1994 by the Challenge Anneka TV show. In 2002, Lelaina Hall, a five-year-old girl from Worcester, died on the mud flats before help could reach her. The outcry over her death {{prompted}} a Western Daily Press campaign to fund an inshore hovercraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a {{disaster}} for the French. According to unofficial accounts, they lost approximately 900men killed or drowned and at least 300wounded, in addition to the loss of a number of the newly constructed landing <b>craft.</b> <b>In</b> France the newly appointed Minister of Marine Étienne Eustache Bruix ordered a second attempt on the islands soon afterwards but the orders were immediately countermanded by the French Directory, which did not want the embarrassment of a second disastrous attack. Instead, Lacrosse gave orders for most of the surviving ships to be sent to Cherbourg, detachments later reaching Saint Malo and Granville. Muskein was ordered to return to Le Havre with the remainder.|$|E

5|$|There was {{a period}} of renewed {{lobbying}} for a road crossing in the 1920s and 1930s, at which time the only vehicle crossing was a single passenger and vehicle ferry. Sir William Denny championed the expansion of that service in the 1930s, providing and operating on behalf of the London and North Eastern Railway two additional ferries that aimed to supplement the services of the adjacent railway bridge. Their success allowed for the addition of two more <b>craft</b> <b>in</b> the 1940s and 1950s, by which time the ferries were making 40,000 crossings annually, carrying 1.5 million passengers and 800,000 vehicles.|$|E

Florida Governor Claude Kirk ordered health units and law enforcement to operate on emergency alert.

5|$|Wipeout is {{a racing}} game that {{is set in}} 2052, where players compete in the F3600 anti-gravity racing league. The game allows the player to pilot one of a {{selection}} of <b>craft</b> <b>in</b> races on several different tracks. There are four racing teams to choose from, and two ships for each team. Each ship has its distinct characteristics of acceleration, top speed, mass, and turning radius. By piloting their craft over power-up pads found on the tracks, the player can pick up various weapons and power-ups such as shields, turbo boosts, mines, shock waves, rockets, or missiles. The power-ups allow the player to either protect their craft or disrupt the competitors' craft.|$|E
