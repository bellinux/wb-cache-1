40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} the distortions that banks’ <b>cross-border</b> <b>activities,</b> such as foreign assets, deposits and equity, can introduce into regulatory interventions. We find that while each individual dimension of <b>cross-border</b> <b>activities</b> distorts the incentives {{of a domestic}} regulator, a balanced amount of <b>cross-border</b> <b>activities</b> does not necessarily cause inefficiencies, as the various distortions can offset each other. Empirical analysis using bank-level data from the recent crisis provide support to our theoretical findings. Specifically, banks with a higher share of foreign deposits and assets and a lower foreign equity share were intervened at a more fragile state, reflecting the distorted incentives of national regulators. We discuss several implications for the supervision of cross-border banks in Europe. ...|$|R

50|$|Sometimes nomadic pastoralists {{move their}} herds across {{international}} borders {{in search of}} new grazing terrain or for trade. This <b>cross-border</b> <b>activity</b> can occasionally lead to tensions with national governments as this activity is often informal and beyond their control and regulation. In East Africa, for example, over 95% of cross-border trade is through unofficial channels and the unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 {{times more than the}} official figure). This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration. However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, governments are unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.|$|E

The USCA identified 53 unresolved cases that had been pending for 18 months or more subsequent to the filing of the application (see “Unresolved Return Applications” section of this report). In 38 of these unresolved cases, the USCA requested the MCA’s assistance to locate the children with the help of Mexican law enforcement authorities,including Interpol and Mexico’s federal investigations agency, the Agencia Federal de Investigación (AFI). In many of the cases, the LBP was able to provide the MCA with last known street addresses for the TP and child along with telephone numbers and the names of the schools the child might be attending, but the Mexican authorities failed to locate them. Two main factors, we believe, contributed to this problem: first, too few law enforcement agents have been assigned to cover large territories and populations; and second, an apparent lower priority has been given to international child abduction cases compared to other, increasingly violent criminal activity.|$|E
40|$|Cross-border {{investments}} {{represent a}} substantial share of venture capital activities. We use a comprehensive dataset on investments worldwide {{to analyze the}} internationalization of venture capital financing. We postulate that <b>cross-border</b> <b>activity</b> is shaped by macroeconomic factors in the venture capitalists' and the portfolio companies' countries, as well as characteristics of the venture capitalists and the deals, which likely affect {{the costs and benefits}} of investing abroad. In order to analyze how country-specific, venture capitalist-specific and deal-specific factors affect <b>cross-border</b> <b>activity,</b> we use the country, venture capitalist and portfolio company perspectives. Our results suggest that factors capturing the benefits and costs of investing abroad determine international venture capital flows. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper offers}} {{a vision of}} the future of <b>cross-border</b> <b>activities</b> between Germany and the Central and East European reform countries. It {{provides}} a comprehensive theoretical framework and it presents some stylized facts. It focuses on three prominent areas: trade in goods and services, off-shore processing and foreign direct investment. Although trade in goods and services is still the dominant form of <b>cross-border</b> <b>activities,</b> other forms make up mightily. Industry and country variables strongly influence the type of activities. Trade and off-shore processing are predominantly derived from comparative advantages (especially cheap labour) in Heckscher- Ohlin industries. Foreign direct investment, however, can be found mainly in (mobile) Schumpcter industries. ...|$|R

40|$|Two literatures exist {{concerning}} <b>cross-border</b> merger <b>activity's</b> {{impact on}} domestic wages: one focusing on positive spillover-effects; the other focusing on negative bargaining-effects. Motivated by scarce theoretical scholarship spanning these literatures, we nest both mechanisms {{in a single}} conceptual framework. Considering the separate phenomena of inward and outward <b>cross-border</b> merger <b>activity,</b> our theoretical model generates three formal propositions: cross-border mergers can lead to wage increases via positive spillover-effects; and negative bargaining-effects are relatively more dominant when union market power is high, and when merging firms exhibit relatedness. Employing US firm-level panel data on wages combined with industry-level data on unionization and merger activity (covering 1989 - 2001), we find support for our propositions as inward and outward <b>cross-border</b> merger <b>activity</b> generate positive spillovers to wages, but {{are more likely to}} generate firm-level wage decreases when unionization rates are high and when <b>cross-border</b> merger <b>activity</b> is characterized as horizontal. Accordingly, future research on how cross-border mergers affect domestic wages should be mindful that both spillover and bargaining effects are at play, and that the degree of union market-power and the relatedness of <b>cross-border</b> merger <b>activity</b> are critical in determining which effect dominates.

30|$|Our {{findings}} have implication for policies of immigration control, immigrant integration, and co-development. Modern nation-states place contradictory demands on migrant’s <b>cross-border</b> <b>activities.</b> On the one hand, many destination-country governments {{have started to}} recognize the role that migrants can and do play {{in the development of}} their homelands and have put in place “co-development” schemes (Kabbanji, 2013; Weil, 2002) to leverage transnational activities for the benefit of development programs. On the other hand, states have erected increasingly restrictive immigration-control apparatuses that make it difficult to acquire secure legal status. This difficulty translates into a captured loyalty among legal migrants, who have invested heavily in their membership, and a physical territorial confinement of those migrants who lack regular status. The immigration-control control apparatus, coupled with a dominant ideology of assimilation that often looks askance at foreign loyalties, thus implicitly limits the <b>cross-border</b> <b>activities</b> of both documented and undocumented migrants.|$|R
