50|$|On {{the warm}} {{side of the}} {{insulation}} the temperature gradient gets steeper with increasing air flow. This implies heat is flowing into the wall at a greater rate than for <b>conventional</b> <b>insulation</b> (air speed = 0 mm/s). For the case shown of air flowing through the insulation at 1mm/s the temperature gradient on the warm side of the insulation x/L = 1) is 621 °C/m which compares with only 100 °C/m for the <b>conventional</b> <b>insulation.</b> This implies that with an air flow of 1mm/s the inner surface is absorbing 6 times as much heat as that for <b>conventional</b> <b>insulation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since {{the core}} {{material}} of a VIP {{is similar in}} thermal characteristics to materials used in <b>conventional</b> <b>insulation,</b> VIPs therefore achieve a much lower thermal conductivity (k-value) than <b>conventional</b> <b>insulation,</b> or in other words a higher thermal resistance per unit of thickness. Typically, commercially available VIPs achieve a thermal conductivity of 0.004 W/(m·K) across {{the centre of the}} panel, or an overall value of 0.006-0.008 W/(m·K) after allowing for thermal bridging (heat conduction across the panel edges) and the inevitable gradual loss of vacuum over time.|$|E
40|$|Vacuum {{insulation}} panel (VIP) is {{an emerging}} insulation {{technology that is}} slowly finding applications in buildings due to its energy saving potential. VIP consists of an evacuated nanoporous core material that is sealed off with an impermeable enclosure. Nanoporous structure of core in conjunction with reduced air pressure results in an ultra-low thermal conductivity of VIP that is almost 5 - 10 times smaller than the <b>conventional</b> <b>insulations</b> such as foams and fibers. In this paper, we first provide a brief discussion on heat transfer mechanisms {{that are responsible for}} reduced thermal conductivity of VIP. Next, we investigated the cost performance ofVIP technology when implemented in the deep energy building retrofits in cold climate regions of the northern US. Deep energy retrofits in cold climate regions generally require higher target R-value envelopes. VIPs with significantly higher R-value per unit thickness than the <b>conventional</b> <b>insulations</b> save considerably on the cost associated with the loss of living space caused by the installation itself. In deep energy retrofits, thinner VIP installations may also eliminate the cost associated with alteration of window and door openings, which is otherwise necessary for thicker layers of <b>conventional</b> <b>insulations.</b> We compare the VIP retrofit method against a number of thermally equivalent <b>conventional</b> wall <b>insulation</b> techniques using foam sheathing, sprayed foam, fiber insulations, etc. The cost analysis indicates that for lower pricedVIPs, the proposed method ofVIP wall retrofit may become cost competitive with current deep retrofit strategies that employ foam insulations. We predict that in the near future, further advancements in VIP manufacturing technology, larger volume production, and higher reliability through quality control of cores and films will enhance VIP cost effectiveness as a retrofit option for providing local insulation and mitigating thermal bridging effects in building envelopes...|$|R

50|$|The thermal {{resistance}} of VIPs per unit thickness compares very favourably to <b>conventional</b> <b>insulation.</b> For instance, standard mineral wool has a thermal conductivity of 0.044 W/(m·K), and rigid polyurethane foam panels about 0.024 W/(m·K). This means that VIPs have about one-fifth the thermal conductivity of <b>conventional</b> <b>insulation,</b> and therefore {{about five times}} the {{thermal resistance}} (R-value) per unit thickness. Based on a typical k-value of 0.007 W/(m·K), the R-value of a typical 25 mm-thick VIP would be 3.5 m2·K/W (20 h·ft²·°F/BTU). To provide the same R-value, 154 mm of rockwool or 84 mm of rigid polyurethane foam panel would be required.|$|E

50|$|In addition, VIP {{products}} {{cannot be}} cut to fit as with <b>conventional</b> <b>insulation,</b> as this {{would destroy the}} vacuum, and VIPs in non-standard sizes {{must be made to}} order, which also increases the cost. So far this high cost has generally kept VIPs out of traditional housing situations, However, their very low thermal conductivity makes them useful in situations where either strict insulation requirements or space constraints make traditional insulation impractical. VIP performance is also temperature dependent—with increasing temperature, convective and radiative transfer increase. Furthermore, typical panels cannot operate much above 100 °C due to the adhesive used to seal the thin envelope.|$|E
50|$|On {{the cold}} {{side of the}} {{insulation}} the temperature gradient gets steeper with increasing air outward flow.

In pro-flux mode heat is flowing out of the wall at a greater rate than the case for <b>conventional</b> <b>insulation.</b> Warm moist air flowing out through the insulation and cooling rapidly increases the risk of condensation occurring within the insulation which will degrade the thermal performance of the wall and could, if prolonged, lead to mould growth and timber decay.|$|E

Nearly zero energy buildings cannot be realized without highly insulated building envelopes. New thermal insulation solutions are needed to fulfil the performance and buildability requirements.

The main objective was to identify the R&D topics, product development priorities and the emerging and promising technologies and materials that can support technology leaps towards energy and resource efficient targets. The study included state-of-the-art report, analysis of key performance indicators of thermal insulation products, a sophisticated patent search and several interviews of professionals in the building sector. The interviews followed by workshops revealed the visions, expectations, barriers, trends and hypes that are related to the energy efficient building envelope applications.

50|$|Fig 5 {{shows the}} typical {{behaviour}} {{of the dynamic}} insulation temperature profile when the air flows {{in the same direction}} to the conductive heat flow (pro-flux). As air at room temperature flows outwards with increasing speed the temperature profile becomes increasingly more curved. On the warm side of the insulation the temperature gradient becomes increasingly horizontal as the warm air prevents the insulation cooling down in the linear way that would occur with no air flow. The conductive heat loss into the wall is very much less than that for <b>conventional</b> <b>insulation.</b> This {{does not mean that the}} transmission heat loss for the insulation is very low.|$|E
50|$|However, thermal {{resistance}} per unit price {{is much less}} than conventional materials. VIPs {{are more difficult to}} manufacture than polyurethane foams or mineral wools, and strict quality control of manufacture of the membranes and sealing joins is important if a panel is to maintain its vacuum {{over a long period of}} time. Air will gradually enter the panel, and as the pressure of the panel normalizes with its surrounding air its R-value deteriorates. <b>Conventional</b> <b>insulation</b> does not depend on the evacuation of air for its thermal performance, and is therefore not susceptible to this form of deterioration. However, materials like polyurethane foam are susceptible to water absorption and performance degradation as well.|$|E
40|$|This article investigates {{impact of}} substituting fumed silica with a cellulosic-crystal {{innovation}} {{in a commercial}} Vacuum Insulated Panel (VIP) core. High building performance demands have attracted VIP technology investment to increase production capacity and reduce cost. In building retrofit VIPs resolve practical problems on space saving that <b>conventional</b> <b>insulations</b> are unsuitable for. Three challenges exists in fumed silica: cost, low sustainability properties, and manufacture technical maturity. Cellulosic nano-crystal (CNC) technology is in its infancy and {{was identified as a}} possible alternative due to a similar physical nano-structure, and biodegradability. The study aim was to determine a performance starting point and establish how this compares with the current benchmarks. Laboratory cellulosic-crystal samples were produced and supplied for incorporation into commercial VIP manufacture. A selection of cellulosic-panels with core densities ranging 127 – 170 kg/m 3 were produced. Thermal conductivities were tested at a pressure of 1 Pa (0. 01 mBar), with the results compared against a selection of fumed silica-VIPs with core densities ranging 144 – 180 kg/m 3. Conductivity tests were then done on a cellulosic-VIP with 140 kg/m 3 density, under variable pressures ranging 1 – 100, 000 Pa (0. 01 – 1000 mBar). This investigated panel lifespan performance, with comparisons made to a fumed silica-VIP of similar core density. Manufactured cellulosic-samples were found unsuitable as a commercial substitute, with performance below current standards. Areas for cellulosic nano-material technology development were identified that show large scope for improvement. Pursuit could create a new generation of insulation materials that resolve problems associated with current commercial versions. This is most applicable in building retrofit where large ranges of domestic and commercial cases are marginalised from their construction markets due to impracticalities and high upgrade costs.

50|$|How {{the heat}} flow (W/m2K) {{from the outer}} or cold surface of the {{insulation}} varies with air flow through the insulation is shown in Fig 6.

Thus, efforts to develop VIPs with characteristics suitable for applications to new and existing buildings are underway. This paper provides a review of important contemporary developments towards producing VIPs using various materials such as glass fibre, foams, perlite and fibre/powder composites. The limitations of the materials currently used to fabricate VIPs have not been emphasised in detail in previous review papers published. Selection criteria, methods to measure important properties of VIPs and analytical and numerical models presented in the past have been detailed.
