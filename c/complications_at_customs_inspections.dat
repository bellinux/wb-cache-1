[...] Namibia prosecutors accuse them of joining in a bribery scheme that secured a $55.3 million contract in May 2008 to install Nuctech scanners <b>at</b> <b>customs</b> <b>inspection</b> points across Namibia.

5000|$|Non-tariff {{barriers}} to trade (NTBs) or sometimes called [...] "Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs)" [...] are trade barriers that restrict imports or exports of goods or services through mechanisms other than the simple imposition of tariffs. The SADC says, [...] "a Non-Tariff Barrier is any obstacle to international trade {{that is not an}} import or export duty. They may take the form of import quotas, subsidies, customs delays, technical barriers, or other systems preventing or impeding trade." [...] According to the World Trade Organisation, non-tariff {{barriers to}} trade include import licensing, rules for valuation of goods <b>at</b> <b>customs,</b> pre-shipment <b>inspections,</b> rules of origin ('made in'), and trade prepared investment measures.|$|R
50|$|After the September 11 {{attacks in}} the US and {{the passage of the}} Patriot Act by the US Congress, balikbayan boxes have been {{subjected}} to rigorous inspections by the United States Department of Homeland Security's Out-Bound Exam Team that caused massive delays of up to three weeks <b>at</b> the US <b>Customs</b> <b>inspection</b> facility. This extended shipping time from 21 days to 30 plus days. The inspections also resulted in opened balikbayan boxes and complaints of pilferage and mishandling. The Bureau of Customs also conducts 100% inspections that added to the burden of delayed shipments. The inspections are the result of some unscrupulous individuals who use balikbayan boxes to smuggle commercial items without paying taxes or smuggle contraband. Since balikbayan box shipping is a consolidated shipment, even one illegal item will affect all 400 or so packages inside the container. The inspection process has been modernized with the installation of high performance X-ray machines.|$|R

50|$|In 1920 {{northern}} Schleswig {{became part}} of Denmark, and the border was established between Niebüll and Tonder. This meant that traffic to Sylt had to cross the German-Danish border twice, although the Danish authorities allowed sealed transit trains to operate, avoiding <b>customs</b> <b>inspections</b> of passengers. The operation of transit trains and the Hoyer-Sylt ferry ended with the inauguration of the Hindenburg causeway in 1927.|$|R

30|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of the CA, maintaining the balance between the efficiency and effectiveness of the <b>customs</b> <b>inspection</b> system is a constant challenge. At Taoyuan Airport, the grey area in the SECCS {{seems to be the}} incentives that attract express businesses. In 2014, more than 91  % of express cargoes used the SECCS. For example, if the SECCS moves forward to achieve effectiveness in capturing more tax evasion cargoes, and the proportion of C 3 increases from 2 – 3  % to 10  %, the economic impact and complaints from consignees and brokers must be excessive to be afforded by the CA. However, Taipei Port is developing a shipping express business with a modified system that leaves little space for tax evasion. This situation could be another case study for the trade-off between the effectiveness and efficiency of <b>customs</b> <b>inspection,</b> and the CA should seriously consider whether or not the SECCS should be a long-term strategy to keep the two different inspection standards of the SECCS in North Taiwan.|$|R
25|$|Thus, {{numerous}} underlying cross-border {{problems are}} {{at the root of}} the difficulties of regional rail transport. A lack of track-sharing agreements means that a single operator moving goods through two or more countries is not feasible.

There is no system of sealing wagons to avoid the need for <b>customs</b> <b>inspections</b> <b>at</b> borders or within transit countries.|$|R

50|$|Preclearance is {{particularly}} beneficial {{to those who}} have an ongoing connection (such as a connecting flight), as there is no risk of border delays causing them to miss their connection. (A corresponding drawback, however, is that a delay in preclearance could cause the passenger to miss the outbound flight.) Air travelers with further connections have their baggage checked through to their destination; without preclearance, the baggage would have to be collected prior to <b>customs</b> <b>inspection</b> and then rechecked onto the subsequent flight.|$|R
