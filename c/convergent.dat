5|$|Insect {{mouthparts}} show {{many examples}} of <b>convergent</b> evolution. The mouthparts of different insect groups consist {{of a set of}} homologous organs, specialised for the dietary intake of that insect group. <b>Convergent</b> evolution of many groups of insects led from original biting-chewing mouthparts to different, more specialised, derived function types. These include, for example, the proboscis of flower-visiting insects such as bees and flower beetles, or the biting-sucking mouthparts of blood-sucking insects such as fleas and mosquitos.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the theropod clade Abelisauridae, which is considered a family in Linnaean taxonomy. Along with the family Noasauridae, abelisaurids are included in the superfamily Abelisauroidea, which is in turn a subdivision of the infraorder Ceratosauria. Abelisaurids are known for their tall skulls with blunt snouts, extensive sculpturing on the outer surfaces of the facial bones (<b>convergent</b> with carcharodontosaurids), very reduced (atrophied) forelimbs (<b>convergent</b> with tyrannosaurids), and stocky hindlimb proportions, among other features.|$|E

5|$|Phylogenetic {{reconstruction}} and ancestral state reconstruction proceed by assuming that evolution has occurred without convergence. <b>Convergent</b> patterns may, however, appear {{at higher levels}} in a phylogenetic reconstruction, and are sometimes explicitly sought by investigators. The methods applied to infer <b>convergent</b> evolution depend on whether pattern-based or process-based convergence is expected. Pattern-based convergence is the broader term, for when two or more lineages independently evolve patterns of similar traits. Process-based convergence is when the convergence is due to similar forces of natural selection.|$|E

5|$|When {{two species}} {{are similar in}} a {{particular}} character, evolution is defined as parallel if the ancestors were also similar, and <b>convergent</b> if they were not.

5|$|After {{the initial}} {{sequence}} of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed.

5|$|Although {{traditionally}} grouped with millipedes and centipedes—possibly on {{the basis}} of <b>convergent</b> adaptations to terrestrialisation—evidence has emerged favoring closer evolutionary ties with crustaceans.
