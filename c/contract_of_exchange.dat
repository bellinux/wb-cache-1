40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{analysis of the}} demand for debt-based financing instruments of the Islamic banks. Debt-based financing, such as through bai bithaman ajil and al-murabahah, {{is by far the}} most prominent of the Islamic bank financing system and yet it has been largely ignored in Islamic economics literature. Most studies instead have been focusing on equity-based financing of al-mudarabah and al-musyarakah. Islamic banks offer debt-based financing through various instruments derived under the principle of exchange or more specifically, the deferred <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> In this paper we set an analytical framework that is based on an infinitely lived representative agent model to analyze the demand for goods to be purchased by deferred payments. The resulting demand will then be used to derive the demand for Islamic debt. We also investigate theoretically, factors that may have an impact on the demand for Islamic debt...|$|E
40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] Faculty of Law, Rand Afrikaans University, 29 August 1974 The {{principles}} of the modern {{law of negotiable instruments}} are the product of an evolution spanning many centuries. Originally the cambial obligation was based on the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> an agreement in terms of which the one party undertook to pay {{a certain amount of money}} to the other party and the latter undertook to repay or cause to be repaid the same amount of money at a different time and place and in a different currency. This <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> was executed by means of a bill of exchange, which can functionally be described as an instrument for the transfer of money. The bill of exchange, or its delivery, had no independent obligatory force. The theory of the law of negotiable instruments, at that stage, centred on the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and the medieval writers strove to analyse and classify it within the system of the Roman law of contract. From the 17 th century, the bill of exchange evolved into an instrument of credit. It became a perfectly flexible paper currency adapted to the needs of commerce and the cambial obligation was accordingly founded on the bill itself. Predominant was the idea of a litterarum obligatio. The reaction against the old theory, however. went much too far and the law of bills of exchange was no longer explained in terms of the known concepts of the law of obligations. The Kreationstheorie became popular, resting the cambial obligation not on contract but on the unilateral and abstract promise of the drawer to pay. In the bill, according to this theory, the drawer objectifies his intention to be bound to every factual holder of the instrument. This view dominated judicial thought in Europe during the nineteenth century and found its expression in English decisions then current and still inspires authors of the present day. It is, however, based on a misconception. The Kreationstheorie led to the unavoidable consequence that even a thief or finder of a lost document could, in theory, be a creditor. A corrective was thus necessary and in the effort to find this corrective the modern {{principles of}} the law of negotiable instruments were born. Originally, in terms of the different "theories of property" that developed as a reaction to the Kreationstheorie, the mere signature of the drawer or other party is insufficient to found the cambial obligation. To found this obligation it is necessary also for the holder to acquire ownership of the document. These "theories" were not far removed from the ideas underlying the continental rules that sanction the acquisition of property in movables a non domino. Their present importance is, however, not that they offer an explanation for the creation of the cambial obligation, but that they stress the nexus between holding a bill of exchange and exercising the personal right evidenced by it. The bill of exchange is a negotiable instrument, a Wertpapier. A negotiable instrument is a document in which a personal right is incorporated in such a manner that it can be exercised through possession of the document only. Exercise of the personal right presupposes possession. Hence the axiom of the modern law: das Recht aus dem Papier folgt dem Recht am Papier. But acceptance of this axiom still leaves unexplained the source of the cambial obligation. It is one thing to give the holder in due course, who acquired a non domino, a real right, but entirely another thing to hold the drawer, acceptor or indorser of a lost or stolen document contractually liable. The cardinal objection to the Kreationstheorie is that it elevates a mere signature on a bill of exchange to a declaration of an intention to be bound. The drawer of an instrument who locks it away, has no intention to be bound and makes no such declaration. Nothing can be simpler than this. Any proper theory has to proceed from the normal situation. It can accordingly be stated that the source of the cambial obligation is contract, but a contract whose form is dictated by the character of the bill of exchange as a negotiable instrument. It is thus concluded by delivery, which is directed both at the transfer of a real right to the document and the founding of a personal right on it. Despite the rejection of the Kreationstheorie, with its idea of the direct and abstract promise to pay, it is accepted that the cambial obligation is an abstract obligation. Abstract in the sense that it is autonomous and not dependent on the validity of the causal obligation. Vis-a-vis third parties this abstraction entails the unavailability of defences arising from the causal obligation (material abstraction). The same abstraction is found in the figures of the delegation imparfaite, the credit card, the irrevocable credit and to a lesser extent in the contract of suretyship. Between immediate parties, on the other hand, the cambial obligation is only formally abstract. This implies a shifting of proof. The creditor is discharged of the onus other than that relating to the abstract promise to pay. Between immediate parties the rule is the availability of defences. The cambial obligation is, however, not always founded on contract. The liability of the drawer of a lost or stolen instrument to a holder in due course is not based on contract but on the protection of the legitimate confidence, or estoppel. By drawing, accepting or indorsing, the debtor creates the appearance of being contractually bound. He is held responsible for this appearance when he knowingly or negligently signed the bill of exchange. Having created the appearance of contractual liability, he is deemed to be bound contractually. Estoppel, or the protection of the legimate confidence, not only explains the acquisition of the real and personal rights in and arising from the bill of exchange, but also the principle of the unavailability of defences. Negotiation is in principle the same as cession, but with the difference that the holder in due course obtains the personal right as it is incorporated in the document. The debtor has created the appearance of his being bound strictly according to the tenor of the bill and he is held liable accordingly. This is the sense of the medieval words quod non est in cambia non est in mundo...|$|E

These contract exchanges have greatly benefited both their participants and the public at large, but participation was long limited to a wealthy few. A decade ago, however, Internet websites, including Hotwire and Priceline, brought the power <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> <b>exchanges</b> directly to consumers, allowing regular people to flex their collective bargaining power to obtain low prices on travel services. Even more recently, other such 2 ̆ 2 consumer contract exchanges, 2 ̆ 2 including Prosper and MoneyAisle, have organized vibrant markets for small loans and certificates of deposit {{to the benefit of}} consumer borrowers and investors. Modern contract law usually bends over backwards to protect consumers, so one would surely expect it to be supportive of or at least not hostile to, these developments. Surprisingly, however, one strand of common law doctrine [...] the rules that pertain to so-called 2 ̆ 2 <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> adhesion 2 ̆ 2 [...] actually stifles the development <b>of</b> consumer <b>contract</b> <b>exchanges</b> by undermining the reliable enforceability <b>of</b> the <b>contracts</b> they generate.

5000|$|Key {{moments of}} the play, such as the bond between Barnwell and Trueman in act five, are put into the {{language}} <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> Barnwell describes their union as an [...] "intercourse of woe" [...] instructing Trueman to [...] "pour all your griefs into my breast and in exchange take mine" [...] (Act V, scene ii). While there are obvious homoerotic implications to this dialogue, its presence in the play shows how the exchange created by merchants helps to sustain society.

[...] While Barnwell begins by following calm commerce, a passionate lust replaces it with the theft from Thorowgood and murder of Barnwell's uncle.

[...] While trade can easily sustain itself, passion has nothing stopping it from going to the extreme.

The woman adopted an insurance policy for their children while they were growing up. Her husband had a tendency of adopting the policy for himself, and nominated his wife and their children as beneficiaries. Through the psychotherapy, various means of life insurance became to be cleared as follows: When parents insure for their children and they become beneficiaries, life insurance may act as parent 2 ̆ 7 s defence against the separation from children and may promote mourning work of internal object loss with children 2 ̆ 7 s growth in patient mind. On the other hand, when parents insure for themselves and the children are the beneficiaries, life insurance may reduce parents anxiety about their children 2 ̆ 7 s suffering when they will no more be alive, may develop parents mourning work to the object loss that is own death, may provide valuable gifts for the children, and may be satisfied with narcissistic needs of parents themselves.

However, both theoretical and empirical contributions to the literature fail to offer conclusive support to this assertion.

The trade effects <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> rate risk are reconsidered in a setting with risk-neutral agents and imperfect contract enforcement.

First, an increase in exchange rate risk dramatically inhibits trade when the institutional support for contract enforcement is sufficiently poor. Second, an increase in exchange rate risk encourages trade for some intermediate levels <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> enforcement. Third, for sufficiently high levels <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> enforcement the impact <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> rate risk on trade is negligible...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} key {{factors that influence}} the success <b>of</b> exchange-traded futures <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> Asian futures markets. The results show that successful futures contracts benefit from a large and volatile spot market. In addition, a smaller contract size has {{a positive effect on}} the futures trading volume, which in turn contributes to the success <b>of</b> the futures <b>contract.</b> For specific institutional factors, the choice of the trading platform and the relative size <b>of</b> <b>exchanges</b> are both important to the success <b>of</b> futures <b>contracts.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
