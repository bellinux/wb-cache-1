5|$|The Whitefish Bay National Forest Scenic Byway is a National Forest Scenic Byway {{that runs}} along Whitefish Bay in the Hiawatha National Forest in the U.S. state of Michigan. The byway mostly follows Federal Forest Highway42 (FFH42) through <b>Chippewa</b> <b>County</b> in the Upper Peninsula. As a forest highway, it is {{maintained}} {{jointly by the}} <b>Chippewa</b> <b>County</b> Road Commission (CCRC) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The route of the byway first existed as an earth road by the 1930s; it was improved into a gravel road in the 1940s and paved between the 1950s and the 1980s. The byway designation was created in 1989.|$|E
5|$|M-80 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It runs from Kinross to M-129 near Donaldson. The highway serves {{the site of the}} former Kincheloe Air Force Base and the current <b>Chippewa</b> <b>County</b> International Airport. The designation has been used twice before on roads in the Lower Peninsula in the 1910s through 1930s while the current usage dates back to the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|Past Seney, M-28 {{once again}} enters {{woodlands}} {{on the eastern}} end of the Upper Peninsula. In Luce County, the roadway passes through the community of McMillan en route to Newberry. The Circle Tour departs M-28 to follow M-123 at Newberry, looping north to the Tahquamenon Falls State Park. East of town, the road passes Luce County Airport off of Luce CR399. From there, M-28 crosses the east and west branches of the Sage River and passes south of Soo Junction, before the <b>Chippewa</b> <b>County</b> border.|$|E

5|$|Continuing northward in Montevideo, {{the highway}} {{turns back to}} the east between J. Harley Smith and Lagoon parks. MN29 {{separates}} at the intersection between Washington Avenue and 8th Street, and MN7 continues eastward on Washington through residential areas. The avenue passes the hospital before leaving town. The street name attached to the highway in rural <b>Chippewa</b> <b>County</b> is 50th Street as MN7 runs due east through farm country. The highway crosses another line of the BNSF Railway and MN23 in Clara City before meandering southwesterly to follow 60th Street near Bunde. East of this unincorporated community, the highway crosses into Kandiyohi County. The highway follows 195th Avenue through {{the southern part of the}} county, passing through the communities of Prinsburg and Lake Lillian. In between, it passes south of Blomkest where it intersects US71.|$|E
5|$|M-48 {{currently}} {{starts at}} an interchange with I-75 in the Rudyard area. The highway runs west from the interchange into Rudyard where it turns south, running concurrently with county road H-63. M-48 turns eastward {{south of town}} along 22Mile Road through fields. At Meridian Road, M-48 turns south along M-129 through the community of Pickford. South of town, M-48/M-129 runs long the Chippewa–Mackinac county line and crosses the Munuscong River. M-48 turns east at 26Mile Road into <b>Chippewa</b> <b>County.</b> The highway zig-zags through rural areas in the southeast of the county. It follows Hanna and 28Mile roads to Stalwart. In that community, M-48 runs south on Reynolds Road to a corner on the Chippewa–Mackinac county line where the highway turns back east toward the Goetzville area running through the Lake Superior State Forest. After one last north–south segment, M-48 terminates at a junction with M-134 west of DeTour Village near Albany Harbor.|$|E
5|$|M-80 {{starts at}} exit378 along Interstate 75 (I-75) near Kinross. A short section of it runs {{concurrently}} with H-63 (Mackinac Trail) {{to connect to}} ramps in the interchange. This section runs northeast–southwest across the freeway from Mud Lake before the M-80 designation turns southeasterly along Tone Road running past Kinross Lake in a forested area. Tone Road curves sharply northeasterly and then southeasterly to run around {{the north end of}} the runway complex at the <b>Chippewa</b> <b>County</b> International Airport. The highway runs due east past the airport terminal area to the south and a prison and the residential area of the former Kincheloe Air Force Base to the north. Near Dukes Lake, M-80 crosses Gaines Highway and leaves the former base and runs through forest to the intersection with M-129 where M-80 terminates. The roadway continues eastward as 17Mile Road in Pickford Township.|$|E

25|$|Bailly {{attempted}} to avoid {{involvement in the}} War of 1812, but found {{that he could not}} maintain neutrality. He was a Canadian citizen, and had a huge business headquartered in Montreal. Bailly was appointed a Lieutenant in the Michigan Fencibles, a regiment of Canadian militia, in January 1813. He was seized as a prisoner of war in January 1814, while visiting his post at Parc Aux Vaches (very near the site of today's campus of the University of Notre Dame), by United States militia. He was taken to Fort Detroit and held for two months, until March. Bailly was on Mackinac Island when it was invaded by US forces in July, and was deported with the other Canadian Loyalists to Drummond Island, Canada (now <b>Chippewa</b> <b>County,</b> Michigan), though the Battle of Mackinac Island ended in the retreat of American forces. He sent his eight-year-old daughter Sophia to live with her adopted brother, trader Joseph LaFramboise in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, but the war theater soon expanded westward to that village.|$|E
