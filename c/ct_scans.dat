5|$|Computed {{tomography}} (<b>CT)</b> <b>scans</b> and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} sometimes {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion. Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow {{and the amount of}} osseous uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential for healing in the fragment.|$|E

50|$|Industrial <b>CT</b> <b>Scanning</b> (industrial {{computed}} tomography) is {{a process}} which utilizes X-ray equipment to produce 3D representations of components both externally and internally. Industrial <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> has been utilized {{in many areas of}} industry for internal inspection of components. Some of the key uses for <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> have been flaw detection, failure analysis, metrology, assembly analysis, image-based finite element methods and reverse engineering applications. <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> is also employed in the imaging and conservation of museum artifacts.|$|R
5|$|Adrenal {{tumors are}} {{commonly}} found as incidentalomas, unexpected asymptomatic tumors found during medical imaging.

40|$|EEG {{examination}} and cranial <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> were performed {{almost at the}} same time on 61 epileptics age 7 to 66 years. In <b>CT</b> <b>scan,</b> abnormal findings {{in one form or another}} were found in 32 out of the 61 patients. In three cases, two or more findings such as cerebral atrophy and calcification were shown {{at the same time}}. Intracranial tumor was discovered in four cases with late-onset epilepsy. The rate of abnormal findings in <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> being found was high in partial epileptics, particularly in cases exhibiting elementary seizures. Abnormal CT findings were found very frequently even in the group in which seizures were suppressed by anticonvulsants. Cases showing abnormal <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> findings were numerous among patients with late-onset epilepsy, thus attesting to the usefulness of <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> for this group. Coorelation between abnormality in EEG and abnormal findings in <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was not too high, but the technique in performing the <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> and the performance of the scanner should be taken into consideration with this result. It was stressed that examination of epileptics by a combination of EEG and <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> is very useful...|$|R

5|$|For both NSCLC and SCLC, the {{two general}} types of staging {{evaluations}} are clinical staging and surgical staging. Clinical staging is performed prior to definitive surgery. It {{is based on}} the results of imaging studies (such as <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and PET scans) and biopsy results. Surgical staging is evaluated either during or after the operation and {{is based on the}} combined results of surgical and clinical findings, including surgical sampling of thoracic lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are controlled in different ways. The fibrofolliculomas {{can be removed}} surgically, through curettage, shave excision, skin resurfacing, or laser ablation; however, {{this is not a}} permanent solution as the tumors often recur. The renal and pulmonary symptoms are managed preventatively: <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> ultrasounds, or MRIs of the kidneys are recommended regularly, and family members are advised not to smoke. MRIs are the preferred method for surveillance of the kidneys in people with BHD because they do not carry the same risk of radiation complications as <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and are more sensitive than ultrasounds. Smokers with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have more severe pulmonary symptoms than non-smokers. Though nephrectomy is sometimes indicated, kidney tumors in cases of Birt–Hogg–Dubé are often removed without taking the whole kidney, in a procedure called partial nephrectomy. Knockout mouse studies have shown that administration of rapamycin may mitigate the effects of FLCN mutations on kidneys and improve renal cancer prognoses because of folliculin's interaction with the mTOR pathway.|$|E
5|$|The {{tumor marker}} CA-125 is {{frequently}} elevated in endometrial cancer {{and can be}} used to monitor response to treatment, particularly in serous cell cancer or advanced disease. Periodic MRIs or <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> may be recommended in advanced disease and women with a history of endometrial cancer should receive more frequent pelvic examinations for the five years following treatment. Examinations conducted every three to four months are recommended for the first two years following treatment, and every six months for the next three years.|$|E
40|$|Thirty-four {{consecutive}} adult {{patients with}} subdural traumatic hygroma were analysed for clinical evolution, serial computed tomography <b>scan</b> (<b>CT),</b> and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) {{over a period of}} several months.

40|$|This {{retrospective}} study {{is aimed at}} evaluating the role of <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> in predicting parametrium involvement in early stage of cervical carcinoma. It was conducted in a Gynaecologic Oncology Centre, Hospital Alor Star from January 2004 till December 2008. All patients with operable stage I and II cervical cancer had pelvic <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> for evaluation of parametrium involvement before undergoing radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Parametrial streakiness or presence of infiltration suggested local invasion. Following radical hysterectomy, the specimens sent for histological confirmation and {{the correlation between the}} <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> finding and the histopathology result was studied. The result revealed a total of 104 patients with operable stage cervical carcinoma had pelvic <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> The sensitivity and the specificity of <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> in assessing parametrial involvement was 33. 3 % and 84. 8 %, respectively. In conclusion, <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> had high specificity but low sensitivity in determining parametrial involvement in early stage of cervical cancer. Hence, routine preoperative pelvic <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> has a limited role in assessing parametrial involvement in early stage cervical carcinoma...|$|R

Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scans.</b> The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} that holes in the skulls of several {{specimens}} that were previously explained by intraspecific attacks might {{have been caused by}} Trichomonas-like parasites that commonly infect avians. Further evidence of intraspecific attack were found by Joseph Peterson and his colleagues in the juvenile Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Jane. Peterson and his team found that Jane's skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile Tyrannosaurus. Subsequent <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> of Jane's skull would further confirm the team's hypothesis, showing that the puncture wounds came from a traumatic injury and that there was subsequent healing. The team would also state that Jane's injuries were structurally different from the parasite-induced lesions found in Sue and that Jane's injuries were on her face whereas the parasite that infected Sue caused lesions to the lower jaw.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist Don Brothwell {{considers}} {{that many of}} the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. The study of bog bodies, including these found in Lindow Moss, has contributed to a wider understanding of well-preserved human remains, helping to develop new methods in analysis and investigation. The use of sophisticated techniques, such as computer tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scans,</b> has marked the investigation of the Lindow bodies as particularly important. Such scans allow the reconstruction of the body and internal examination. Of the 27bodies recovered from lowland raised mires in England and Wales, only those from Lindow Moss and the remains of Worsley Man have survived, together with a shoe from another body. The remains have a date range from the early 1st to the 4thcenturies. Investigation into the other bodies relies on contemporary descriptions of the discovery.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackground and purpose: Since {{headache}} {{is one of}} {{the common}} problems in children and adolescents and only a minority of them have a life threatening intracranial lesions and performing brain <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> in many of such cases is costly, therefore it was decided to evaluate the findings of brain <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> of children with chronic and recurrent headache. Materials and Methods: This study was performed on 300 children of 5 - 15 years of age with a complaint of chronic recurrenthead-ache in kashan in 1999. History of present illness, physical and neurological examinations and also brain <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was done. Data were recorded in a special questionnaires and analyzed statistically. Results: Patients under study comprised of 53. 3 % girls and 46. 7 % boys with mean age of 10. 3 ± 2. 85. The most common type of headache was migraine with the frequency of 45. 3 %. brain <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was normal in 98 % of the patients and only six patients(2 %) had abnormal brain <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> All the patients with abnormal neurological findings had also abnormal brain <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> (sensitivity= 100 %), and all the patients with normal neurological examinations had a normal brain <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> (specificity= 100 %) the correlation between physical finding and brain <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was 100 %. Conclusion: Performing brain <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> is not necessary in all children with chronic and recurrent headache, and it is only recommended in patients with positive findings on physical or neurological examinations...|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised over alleged overuse of <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> and {{inappropriate}} selection of scanning methods, all of which expose patients to unnecessary radiation.

5|$|Complaints of {{low back}} pain {{are one of the}} most common reasons people visit doctors. For pain that has lasted only a few weeks, the pain is likely to subside on its own. Thus, if a person's medical history and {{physical}} examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause, medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X-rays, <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> and MRIs. Individuals may want such tests but, unless red flags are present, they are unnecessary health care. Routine imaging increases costs, is associated with higher rates of surgery with no overall benefit, and the radiation used may be harmful to one's health. Fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the cause of the problem. Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities, encouraging people to request further unnecessary testing or to worry. Even so, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among United States Medicare beneficiaries from 1994 to 2006.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{examination}} of the fossil on March 6, 1999 it had already become clear to Currie that {{the left and right}} feet mirrored each other perfectly and that the fossil had been completed by using both slab and counterslab. He also noticed no connection could be seen between the tail and the body. In July 1999, Currie and the Czerkases brought the fossil to the High-Resolution X-ray CT Facility of the University of Texas (Austin) founded and operated by Dr. Timothy Rowe to make <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Rowe, having made the scans on July 29, determined that they indicated that the bottom fragments, showing the tail and the lower legs, were not part of the larger fossil. He informed the Czerkases on August 2 that there was a chance of the whole being a fraud. During a subsequent discussion Rowe and Currie were pressured by the Czerkases to keep their reservations private.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Deinocheirus was reconstructed through <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and {{presented}} at the 2014 Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology conference. The brain was globular and similar in shape to that of birds and troodontid theropods, the cerebrum was expanded in a way similar to most theropods, and the olfactory tracts were relatively large. The brain was proportionally small and compact, and its Reptile Encephalisation Quotient (brain-body ratio) was estimated at 0.69, which is low for theropods, and similar to sauropods. Other ornithomimosaurs have proportionally large brains, and the small brain of Deinocheirus may reflect its social behaviour or diet. Its coordination and balance {{would not have been}} as important as for carnivorous theropods. A bone microstructure study {{presented at the}} 13th Annual Meeting of the European Association of Vertebrate Palaeontologists in 2015 showed that Deinocheirus probably had a high metabolic rate, and grew rapidly before reaching sexual maturity.|$|E

5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} cancers {{in the brain}} come from {{elsewhere}} in the body – most commonly the lung, breast and skin. Cancers of brain tissue can also occur, and originate from any tissue {{in and around the}} brain. Meningioma, cancer of the meninges around the brain, is more common than cancers of brain tissue. Cancers within the brain may cause symptoms related to their size or position, with symptoms including headache and nausea, or the gradual development of focal symptoms such as gradual difficulty seeing, swallowing, talking, or as a change of mood. Cancers are in general investigated through the use of <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and MRI scans. A variety of other tests including blood tests and lumbar puncture may be used to investigate for the cause of the cancer and evaluate the type and stage of the cancer. The corticosteroid dexamethasone is often given to decrease the swelling of brain tissue around a tumour. Surgery may be considered, however given the complex nature of many tumours or based on tumour stage or type, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be considered more suitable.|$|E
5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E
