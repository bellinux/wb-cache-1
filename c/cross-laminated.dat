50|$|Concerns {{associated}} with timber buildings are predominantly related to acoustics and fire protection. Timber buildings {{are classified as}} poor {{in terms of their}} acoustic performance due to the light structure as compared to reinforced concrete and masonry. However, <b>cross-laminated</b> solid timber panels have a significantly higher density than timber frame buildings. They provide a solid structural core on which different, independent and separating layers can be added. The layer principal overcomes any acoustic or sound transfer issues. In Stadthaus an economic layering strategy of stud walls, floating floor build-ups and suspended ceilings, gave sound attenuation far in excess of building regulations (58 - 60db).|$|E
50|$|<b>Cross-laminated</b> timber (CLT) is a wood panel {{product made}} from solid-sawn lumber. Each layer of boards is orientated {{perpendicular}} to adjacent layers and glued {{on the wide}} faces of each board, usually in a symmetric way so that the outer layers have the same orientation. An odd number of layers is most common but there are configurations with even numbers as well (which are then arranged to give a symmetric configuration). The cross gluing allows using the panels with two span directions whereby some differences in stiffness and strength are observed along the two directions. It is similar to plywood but with distinctively thicker laminations.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} was assembled using a structural <b>cross-laminated</b> timber panel system. The timber panels are produced in Austria by KLH using Spruce planks glued {{together with a}} non-toxic adhesive. The waste timber is converted to fuel powering both the factory and local village. Each panel is prefabricated including cut-outs for windows and doors and routed service channels. As the panels arrived on site they were immediately craned into position and fixed in place. Four carpenters assembled the eight-storey structure in twenty-seven days. The speed of the construction in such a densely populated environment is especially relevant, as {{was the lack of}} noise and waste, creating far less intrusion on the local community than a traditional concrete frame construction.|$|E
50|$|The {{uppermost}} Gondwana unit is the Damudas Sub-Group, {{which is}} characterized by arenite, shale, slate and black coal beds. In fact, the Setikhola Formation and Damudas Sub-Group are together termed as the Gondwana succession. The bedrock of the Damudas Sub-Group {{is made up of}} gritty, micaceous and <b>cross-laminated</b> sandstones. These friable sandstone layers are interbedded with coal beds that have been sheared and crushed. Abundant plant fossils like fern leaves {{can be found on the}} carbonaceous shale, characterising the Damuda coalfields and indicating a Permian age. Generally, the strata here are lenticular and display a fining-upwards sequence. In tectonic context, it is proposed that the Gondwana strata here have experienced post—Gondwana orogenic movements, resulting in folded rocks followed by overturned beddings.|$|E
50|$|Initially grains, pebbles {{and large}} clasts in a {{high-density}} turbidity current (i.e., a high-sand concentration flow), are moved by traction (rolling and sliding) {{to generate a}} coarse-grained to conglomeratic, parallel-laminated to <b>cross-laminated</b> S1 layer. However, as grains settle out and move closer together, grain-to-grain collisions begin to generate dispersive pressures that help prevent further settling. This results in smaller grains moving between larger grains and preferentially settling out beneath them. Thus, an inverse graded layer develops that is called a traction carpet, since it is thought to move as a single unit. At some point, the grains move close enough together that collisions no longer generate enough energy to keep the grains in suspension, and the entire layer freezes to create an S2 layer. This process can then repeat to create additional traction carpets.|$|E
50|$|In a fire, a {{solid wall}} of timber {{benefits}} from the protection of a charred layer and therefore does not combust {{in the same way}} as a single stud. In Stadthaus, five-layer <b>cross-laminated</b> timber panels are used to obtain a fire protection that allows the structure to retain its integrity for at least 90 minutes. This is significantly longer than steel, which fails and buckles at high temperatures. The 90 minutes at Stadthaus have been achieved with the plasterboard finish - two layers of plasterboard provide 60 minutes with the final 30 minutes achieved by the calculation of charring rate of the KLH solid timber panels. Calculations by the project engineers however show that in fact the KLH panels comfortably achieve a 60-minute fire resistance period with the panel thicknesses used for this project so the design team has been slightly modest.|$|E

This is of course largely due to the significant difficulties and increased expense inherent to processing dead timber, and the correspondingly lowered profitability. Blue stained pine is now available at some big box stores like Lowes and makes beautiful woodwork as shown below.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Cross-laminated timber is {{increasingly}} {{being used in}} the construction of high-rise buildings due to its simple manufacturing system. In term of fire resistance, <b>cross-laminated</b> timber panels are promoted as having excellent fire resistance, comparable to that of non-combustible materials and to heavy timber construction, due to the ability of thick wood assemblies to char slowly at a predictable rate while maintaining most of their strength during the fire exposure. This paper presents an overview of fire performance of <b>cross-laminated</b> timber and evaluation of its resistance to elevated temperature in comparison to homogeneous timber panels. Charring rates for <b>cross-laminated</b> timber panels of those obtained experimentally were compared with those provided by Eurocode simplified calculation methods.

30|$|As more {{fractional}} fibers of {{the board}} became involved in sharing the impact stress and the whole deformation increased, the drop impactor was subjected to more resistance. This resulted in a continuous decrease of impact velocity. The deflection {{of the board}} gradually increased until the impactor punctured through the board. Furthermore, the drop rate of the impact velocity curve for the <b>cross-laminated</b> BLVL was {{lower than that of}} the uniaxial-laminated board. In contrast, the fracture deflection for the <b>cross-laminated</b> board was higher than that for the uniaxial lamination. This clearly indicated that the <b>cross-laminated</b> board had higher fracture toughness due to the orthogonal pavement as compared to the parallel stacking style. The analysis above could be correspondingly demonstrated by the observation of the fracture appearance in Fig.  4, in which the delaminated area on the front side of the <b>cross-laminated</b> board was higher than that of the uniaxial-laminated BLVL. The break degree on back side of the <b>cross-laminated</b> board, however, was lower than that of the uniaxial pavement panel.|$|E

The structural perform-ance of five-layer <b>cross-laminated</b> timber elements was in-vestigated. The five layers consisted of 19 mm thick boards, laid successively {{at right angles to}} each other and glued together with PU-adhesive, layers 1, 3 and 5 lying in one direction and layers 2 and 4 in the other. The stiffness and strength of four <b>cross-laminated</b> timber elements (4955 mm long, 1250 mm wide and 96 mm thick) were studied during in-plane bending. Two of the elements were first partitioned into two parts that were reconnected in two different ways prior to testing. The influence {{of the way in which}} the <b>cross-laminated</b> timber elements were reconnected was studied, the behaviour observed being compared with the test results for the unpartitioned specimens with respect to both strength and stiffness. The experimental tests performed showed the <b>cross-laminated</b> timber elements to possess a high degree of stiffness and strength. There was also found to be a marked difference in behaviour between the two different ways in which the elements were connected to each other. One of the two connecting methods studied, being of less good design but earlier frequently used in Sweden, showed as expected poor structural performance, whereas the other one applied as a safer alternative performed well...|$|E
