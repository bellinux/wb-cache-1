40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the relations between}} <b>changes</b> in <b>motor</b> capacity (can do, in standardized environment), motor capability (can do, in daily environment), and motor performance (does do, in daily environment) among children with cerebral palsy (CP). Design Prospective longitudinal study. After baseline measurements (at the age of 18 mo, 30 mo, 5 y, 7 y, 9 y, 11 y, or 13 y), 2 -year follow-up measurements were performed. Change scores were calculated, and Pearson correlations were used for change score relations. Setting Outpatient clinic. Participants Toddlers, school-age children, and adolescents with CP (N= 321; 200 boys, 121 girls). Levels of severity according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System included level I (42 %), level II (15 %), level III (17 %), level IV (13 %), and level V (13 %). Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures <b>Change</b> in <b>motor</b> capacity was assessed with the Gross Motor Function Measure- 66. <b>Changes</b> in <b>motor</b> capability and motor performance were assessed with the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory using the Functional Skills Scale and Caregiver Assistance Scale, respectively. Results Within the total group, change score correlations were moderate (. 52 -. 67) and significant (P<. 001). For age groups, correlations were significantly higher in toddlers than school-age children and adolescents. For severity levels, correlations were significantly higher in children at level III than level I, IV, and V. Conclusions Results imply that <b>change</b> in <b>motor</b> capacity does not automatically translate to <b>change</b> in <b>motor</b> capability and <b>change</b> in <b>motor</b> capability does not automatically translate to <b>change</b> in <b>motor</b> performance. Results also show different relations for clinically relevant subgroups.

40|$|International audienceHuman {{physiological}} hand tremor has a resonant component. Proof {{of this is}} {{that its}} frequency can be modified by adding mass. However, adding mass also increases the load which must be supported. The necessary force requires muscular contraction which will <b>change</b> <b>motor</b> output and is likely to increase limb stiffness. The increased stiffness will partly offset the effect of the increased mass and this can lead to the erroneous conclusion that factors other than resonance are involved in determining tremor frequency. Using a human centrifuge to increase head-to-foot gravitational field strength, we were able to control for the increased effort by increasing force without changing mass. This revealed that the peak frequency of human hand tremor is 99 % predictable {{on the basis of a}} resonant mechanism. We ask what, if anything, the peak frequency of physiological tremor can reveal about the operation of the nervous system...|$|E

Transition to ERP systems is often combined with a business process reengineering effort and intended to produce radical organizational change.

The effects of acute administration of fluoxetine given alone and co-administered with a subthreshold dose of pentetrazole (PTZ), a proconvulsant agent with well recognized anxiogenic properties, were examined in the open field test of neophobia in rats.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} an {{information and communication}} technology (ICT) solution for a post-stroke Personalised Self-Managed Rehabilitation System (PSMrS). The PSMrS translates current models of stroke rehabilitation and theories underpinning self-management and self-efficacy into an ICT-based system for home-based post-stroke rehabilitation. METHODS: The interdisciplinary research team applied a hybrid of health and social sciences research methods and user-centred design methods. This included a series of home visits, focus groups, in-depth interviews, cultural probes and technology biographies. RESULTS: The iterative development of both {{the content of the}} PSMrS and the interactive interfaces between the system and the user incorporates current models of post-stroke rehabilitation and addresses the factors that promote self-managed behaviour and self-efficacy such as mastery, verbal persuasion and physiological feedback. CONCLUSION: The methodological approach has ensured that the interactive technology has been driven by the needs of the stroke survivors and their carers {{in the context of their}} journey to both recovery and adaptation. Underpinned by theories of motor relearning, neuroplasticity, self-management and behaviour change, the PSMrS developed in this study has resulted in a personalised system for self-managed rehabilitation, which has the potential to <b>change</b> <b>motor</b> behaviour and promote the achievement of life goals for stroke survivors...|$|E
40|$|Voluntary exercise, {{treadmill}} activity, skills training, {{and forced}} limb use have been utilized in animal studies to promote brain plasticity and functional <b>change.</b> <b>Motor</b> enrichment may prime {{the brain to}} respond more adaptively to injury, in part by upregulating trophic factors such as GDNF, FGF- 2, or BDNF. Discontinuation of exercise in advance of brain injury may cause levels of trophic factor expression to plummet below baseline, which may leave the brain more vulnerable to degeneration. Underfeeding and motor enrichment induce remarkably similar molecular and cellular changes that could underlie their beneficial effects in the aged or injured brain. Exercise begun before focal ischemic injury increases BDNF and other defenses against cell death and can maintain or expand motor representations defined by cortical microstimulation. Interfering with BDNF synthesis causes the motor representations to recede or disappear. Injury to the brain, even in sedentary rats, causes a small, gradual increase in astrocytic expression of neurotrophic factors in both local and remote brain regions. The neurotrophic factors may inoculate those areas against further damage and enable brain repair and use-dependent synaptogenesis associated with recovery of function or compensatory motor learning. Plasticity mechanisms are particularly active during time-windows early after focal cortical damage or exposure to dopamine neurotoxins. Motor and cognitive impairments may contribute t...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} inhibit {{unwanted}} movements and <b>change</b> <b>motor</b> plans {{is essential for}} behaviors of advanced organisms. The neural mechanisms by which the primate motor system rejects undesired actions have received much attention during the last decade, {{but it is not}} well understood how this neural function could be utilized to improve the efficiency of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). Here we employed linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and a Wiener filter to extract motor plan transitions from the activity of ensembles of sensorimotor cortex neurons. Two rhesus monkeys, chronically implanted with multielectrode arrays in primary motor (M 1) and primary sensory (S 1) cortices, were overtrained to produce reaching movements with a joystick towards visual targets upon their presentation. Then, the behavioral task was modified to include a distracting target that flashed for 50, 150 or 250 ms (25 % of trials each) followed by the true target that appeared at a different screen location. In the remaining 25 % of trials, the initial target stayed on the screen and was the target to be approached. M 1 and S 1 neuronal activity represented both the true and distracting targets, even for the shortest duration of the distracting event. This dual representation persisted both when the monkey initiated movements towards the distracting target and then made corrections and when they moved directly towards the second, true target. The Wiener filter effectively decoded the location of the true target, whereas the LDA classifier extracted the location of both targets from ensembles of 50 - 250 neurons. Based on these results, we suggest developing real-time BMIs that inhibit unwanted movements represented by brain activity while enacting the desired motor outcome concomitantly...|$|E
