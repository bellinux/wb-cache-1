25|$|Suppression {{capacitors}} {{are effective}} interference reduction components because their electrical impedance decreases with increasing frequency, {{so that at}} higher frequencies they short circuit electrical noise and transients between the lines, or to ground. They therefore prevent equipment and machinery (including motors, inverters, and electronic ballasts, as well as solid-state relay snubbers and spark quenchers) from sending and receiving electromagnetic and radio frequency interference as well as transients in across-the-line (X <b>capacitors)</b> and line-to-ground (<b>Y</b> <b>capacitors)</b> connections. X capacitors effectively absorb symmetrical, balanced, or differential interference. <b>Y</b> <b>capacitors</b> are connected in a line bypass between a line phase and a point of zero potential, to absorb asymmetrical, unbalanced, or common-mode interference.|$|R

30|$|Any large {{deviation}} from the expected values was considered to represent a systematic landscape change. Finally, the fact that class X systematically gained from <b>class</b> <b>Y,</b> while <b>class</b> <b>Y</b> systematically lost to class X, gives conclusive evidence of a dominant signal of landscape transformation (Braimoh 2006). The classified images were compared in three periods, i.e., 1973 – 1986, 1986 – 2000, and 2000 – 2015. Change statistics were computed by comparing image values of one data set with the corresponding value of the second data set in each period. LULC conversion matrix between 1973 and 2015 was generated using ArcGIS 9.1 software and compiled in a matrix table, and the values were presented in terms of hectares.|$|R
