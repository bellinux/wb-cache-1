5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major <b>chordate</b> characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E
25|$|QSER1 {{protein is}} highly conserved in <b>chordate</b> species.|$|E
25|$|QSER1 has one paralog in humans, Proline-rich 12, or PRR12. PRR12 {{is found}} on {{chromosome}} 9 at 9q13.33, {{which does not}} have known function. PRR12 is found in most <b>chordate</b> species {{as far back as}} the coelacanth. The duplication event likely occurred sometime in the <b>chordate</b> lineage near the divergence of the coelacanth. Both PRR12 and QSER1 contain the conserved DUF4211 domain near the 3â€™ ends of the genes.|$|E
50|$|In the {{evolution}} of the <b>chordates,</b> the ancestors of the <b>chordates</b> underwent a profound remodeling of their bauplan, becoming dexiothetetic. All <b>chordates</b> share a common ancestor which lost its echinoderm stereom calcite skeleton. However, later revisions of the theory had each separate lineage losing its calcitic skeleton independently, as it evolved from its own mitrate ancestor, making the <b>chordates</b> a paraphyletic group.|$|R
25|$|Of {{the more}} than 65,000 living species of <b>chordates,</b> about half are bony fish of the {{superclass}} Osteichthyes. The world's largest and fastest animals, the blue whale and peregrine falcon respectively, are <b>chordates,</b> as are humans. Fossil <b>chordates</b> are known from at least {{as early as the}} Cambrian explosion.|$|R
50|$|The resemblances between Balanoglossus {{and true}} <b>chordates</b> in some adult {{structures}} and embryonic and larval stages {{show that the}} hemichordates and the true <b>chordates</b> are, without question, related, however distantly. They are, as mentioned above, closer to invertebrate phyla Echinodermata and Phoronida in their morphology and development than to the <b>Chordates.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} schema is {{from the}} third edition of Vertebrate Palaeontology. The invertebrate <b>chordate</b> classes are from Fishes of the World. While it is structured so as to reflect evolutionary relationships (similar to a cladogram), it also retains the traditional ranks used in Linnaean taxonomy.|$|E
25|$|Attempts to {{work out}} the {{evolutionary}} relationships of the chordates have produced several hypotheses. The current consensus is that chordates are monophyletic, meaning that the Chordata include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, which is itself a <b>chordate,</b> and that craniates' nearest relatives are tunicates.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{earliest}} <b>chordate</b> fossils {{have been found in}} the Early Cambrian Chengjiang fauna, and include two species that are regarded as fish, which implies that they are vertebrates. Because the fossil record of early chordates is poor, only molecular phylogenetics offers a reasonable prospect of dating their emergence. However, the use of molecular phylogenetics for dating evolutionary transitions is controversial.|$|E
50|$|Walter Garstang noted from {{study of}} marine animals that both {{echinoderms}} and <b>chordates</b> are deuterostomes (in which the blastopore forms the anus), while most other possible ancestors of <b>Chordates</b> are protostomes (the blastopore forms the mouth). This inspired Garstang to suggest an alternate route of evolution: from echinoderms to <b>chordates.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, fossils of early <b>chordates</b> are very rare, as non-vertebrate <b>chordates</b> have no bone tissue or teeth, and fossils of no Post-Cambrian non-vertebrate <b>chordates</b> are known {{aside from the}} Permian-aged Paleobranchiostoma, trace fossils of the Ordovician colonial {{tunicate}} Catellocaula, and various Jurassic-aged and Tertiary-aged spicules tentatively attributed to ascidians.|$|R
50|$|Stomochords were {{initially}} considered {{a variant of}} a primitive notochord, {{a defining feature of}} <b>chordates.</b> However, they are now recognized to not share histological composition to that of the notochord found in <b>chordates,</b> lacking the fibrous sheath characteristic of a notochord.|$|R
25|$|Hemichordata, which {{includes}} the acorn worms, has been presented as a fourth <b>chordate</b> subphylum, but it now is usually treated as a separate phylum. The Hemichordata, along with the Echinodermata ({{which includes}} starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and crinoids), form the Ambulacraria, the sister taxon of the Chordates. The Chordata and Ambulacraria form the superphylum Deuterostomia, composed of the deuterostomes.|$|E
25|$|There {{is still}} much ongoing {{differential}} (DNA sequence based) comparison research {{that is trying to}} separate out the simplest forms of chordates. As some lineages of the 90% of species that lack a backbone or notochord might have lost these structures over time, this complicates the classification of chordates. Some <b>chordate</b> lineages may only be found by DNA analysis, when there is no physical trace of any chordate-like structures.|$|E
25|$|A <b>chordate</b> is {{an animal}} {{belonging}} to the phylum Chordata; they possess a notochord, a hollow dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, an endostyle, and a post-anal tail, {{for at least some}} period of their life cycle. Chordates are deuterostomes, as during the embryo development stage the anus forms before the mouth. They are also bilaterally symmetric coelomates. In the case of vertebrate chordates, the notochord is usually replaced by a vertebral column during development, and they may have body plans organized by segmentation.|$|E
2500|$|Craniates, one of {{the three}} subdivisions of <b>chordates,</b> all have {{distinct}} skulls. They include the hagfish which have no vertebrae. Michael J. Benton commented that [...] "craniates are characterized by their heads, just as <b>chordates,</b> or possibly all deuterostomes, are by their tails".|$|R
50|$|The carpoids Cornuta and Mitrata {{are grouped}} {{together}} in a clade called Calcichordata. Cornutes and mitrates are viewed as sister groups, and mitrates represent stem group <b>chordates.</b> The mitrates (and thus the <b>chordates)</b> are all Dexiothetes, dexiothetism being a synapomorphy for the clade.|$|R
5000|$|Craniates, one of {{the three}} subdivisions of <b>chordates,</b> all have {{distinct}} skulls. They include the hagfish which have no vertebrae. Michael J.

25|$|The organism's {{evolutionary}} {{placement and}} unique embryology with five-fold symmetry were the major {{arguments in the}} proposal to seek the sequencing of its genome. Importantly, urchins act as the closest living relative to chordates and thus may {{shed light on the}} evolution of vertebrates. The genome of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, was completed in 2006 and established homology between sea urchin and vertebrate immune system-related genes. Sea urchins code for at least 222 Toll-like receptor genes and over 200 genes related to the Nod-like-receptor family found in vertebrates. This increases its usefulness as a valuable model organism for studying the evolution of innate immunity. The sequencing also revealed that while some genes were thought to be limited to vertebrates, there were also innovations that have previously never been seen outside the <b>chordate</b> classification, such as immune transcription factors PU.1 and SPIB.|$|E
500|$|Fossils of chordates, the phylum {{to which}} humans belong, are very rare in Cambrian sediments. Conway Morris {{classified}} the Burgess Shale fossil Pikaia as a <b>chordate</b> {{because it had}} a rudimentary notochord, the rod of cartilage that evolved into the backbone of vertebrates. Doubts have been raised about this, {{because most of the}} important features are not quite like those of chordates: it has repeated blocks of muscle along its sides but they are not chevron-shaped; there is no clear evidence of anything like gills; and its throat appears to be in the upper part of its body rather than the lower. It also has [...] "tentacles" [...] on the front of its head, unlike living chordates. At best it may be a stem group <b>chordate,</b> in other words an evolutionary [...] "aunt" [...] of living chordates. Metaspriggina, also found in the Burgess Shale but even rarer, may be a <b>chordate,</b> if the repeated chevron-shaped structures along its sides represent muscle blocks. While Pikaia was celebrated in the mid-1970s as the earliest known <b>chordate,</b> three jawless fish have since been found among the Chengjiang fossils, which are about 17million years older than the Burgess Shale.|$|E
2500|$|Cephalochordates are small, [...] "vaguely fish-shaped" [...] {{animals that}} lack brains, clearly defined heads and {{specialized}} sense organs. These burrowing filter-feeders compose the earliest-branching <b>chordate</b> sub-phylum.|$|E

50|$|The calcichordate {{theory is}} not widely {{accepted}} as a viable theory {{on the origins of}} the <b>chordates.</b> Many cite its overall unparsimonius nature as unnecessary, however there are many specific points that can be raised. All in all, the carpoids are much closer to echinoderms than to <b>chordates.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Phosphatic microfossils include conodonts (tiny oral {{structures}} of an extinct <b>chordate</b> group), some scolecodonts ("worm" [...] jaws), Shark spines and teeth, and other Fish remains (collectively called [...] "ichthyoliths").|$|E
2500|$|Fossils of {{one major}} deuterostome group, the {{echinoderms}} (whose modern members include starfish, sea urchins and crinoids), are quite common {{from the start}} of the Cambrian, [...] The Mid Cambrian fossil Rhabdotubus johanssoni has been interpreted as a pterobranch hemichordate. Opinions differ about whether the Chengjiang fauna fossil Yunnanozoon, from the earlier Cambrian, was a hemichordate or <b>chordate.</b> Another fossil, Haikouella lanceolata, also from the Chengjiang fauna, is interpreted as a <b>chordate</b> and possibly a craniate, as it shows signs of a heart, arteries, gill filaments, a tail, a neural chord with a brain at the front end, and possibly eyesâ€”although it also had short tentacles round its mouth. Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia, also from the Chengjiang fauna, are regarded as fish. Pikaia, discovered much earlier (1911) but from the Mid Cambrian Burgess Shale (505 Ma), is also regarded as a primitive <b>chordate.</b> On the other hand, fossils of early chordates are very rare, since invertebrate chordates have no bones or teeth, and only one has been reported for the rest of the Cambrian.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "fish" [...] {{describes}} any non-tetrapod <b>chordate,</b> (i.e., {{an animal}} with a backbone), that has gills throughout life and has limbs, if any, {{in the shape}} of fins. Unlike groupings such as birds or mammals, fish are not a single clade but a paraphyletic collection of taxa, including jawless, cartilaginous and skeletal types.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existence}} of a membrane separating the pharynx from the stomach can be traced widely among the chordates. [...] Thus the model organism, the marine <b>chordate</b> lancelet, possesses an atriopore by which water exits the pharynx, which has been claimed (and disputed) to be homologous to structures in ascidians and hagfishes. [...] The tunicate epicardium separates digestive organs from the pharynx and heart, but the anus returns to the upper compartment to discharge wastes through an outgoing siphon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between}} the <b>chordate</b> groups and between chordates {{as a whole and}} their closest deuterostome relatives have been debated since 1890. Studies based on anatomical, embryological, and paleontological data have produced different [...] "family trees". Some closely linked chordates and hemichordates, but that idea is now rejected. Combining such analyses with data from a small set of ribosome RNA genes eliminated some older ideas, but opened up the possibility that tunicates (urochordates) are [...] "basal deuterostomes", surviving members of the group from which echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates evolved. Some researchers believe that, within the chordates, craniates are most closely related to cephalochordates, but there are also reasons for regarding tunicates (urochordates) as craniates' closest relatives.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the genetic}} work done on hemichordates {{has been done to}} make {{comparison}} with <b>chordates,</b> so it is obvious that many {{of the genetic}} markers identified in this group are also found in <b>chordates</b> or are homologous to <b>chordates</b> in some way. Studies of this nature have been done particularly on S. kowalevskii, and like <b>chordates</b> S. kowalevskii has dorsalizing bmp-like factors such as bmp 2/4, which is homologous to Drosophilaâ€™s decapentaplegic dpp. The expression of bmp2/4 begins at the onset of gastrulation on the ectodermal side of the embryo, and as grastulation progresses its expression is narrowed down to the dorsal midline but is not expressed in the post anal tail. The bmp antagonist chordin is also expressed in the endoderm of gastrulating S. kowalevskii. Besides these well known dorsalizing factors, further molecules known to be involved in dorsal ventral patterning are also present in S. kowalevskii, such as a netrin that groups with netrin gene class 1 and 2. Netrin is important in patterning of the neural system in <b>chordates,</b> as well as is the molecule Shh, but S. kowalevskii was only found to have one hh gene and it appears to be expressed in a region that is uncommon to where it is usually expressed in developing <b>chordates</b> along the ventral midline.|$|R
