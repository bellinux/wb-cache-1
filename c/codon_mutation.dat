40|$|Many organisms exhibit biased codon usage {{in their}} genome, {{including}} the fungal model organism Neurospora crassa. The preferential use of subset of synonymous codons (optimal codons) at the macroevolutionary level {{is believed to}} result from a history of selection to promote translational efficiency. At present, few data are available about selection on optimal codons at the microevolutionary scale, that is, at the population level. Herein, we conducted a large-scale assessment of <b>codon</b> <b>mutations</b> at biallelic sites, spanning more than 5, 100 genes, in 2 distinct populations of N. crassa: the Caribbean and Louisiana populations. Based on analysis of the frequency spectra of synonymous <b>codon</b> <b>mutations</b> at biallelic sites, we found that derived (nonancestral) optimal <b>codon</b> <b>mutations</b> segregate at a higher frequency than derived nonoptimal <b>codon</b> <b>mutations</b> in each population; {{this is consistent with}} natural selection favoring optimal codons. We also report that optimal codon variants were less frequent in longer genes and that the fixation of optimal codons was reduced in rapidly evolving long genes/proteins, trends suggestive of genetic hitchhiking (Hill-Robertson) altering codon usage variation. Notably, nonsynonymous <b>codon</b> <b>mutations</b> segregated at a lower frequency than synonymous nonoptimal <b>codon</b> <b>mutations</b> (which impair translational efficiency) in each N. crassa population, suggesting that changes in protein composition are more detrimental to fitness than mutations altering translation.

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} {{the prevalence of}} pre-S 2 start codon mutations and to assess their association with liver disease progression. METHODS: The mutations were identified by direct sequencing from 73 asymptomatic carriers, 66 chronic hepatitis (CH), 66 liver cirrhosis (LC) and 63 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Statistical significances were determined using Fisher&#x 2019;s exact test, &#x 3 C 7; 2 test, and t-test analyses whenever appropriate. Pre-S mutation as {{a risk factor for}} advanced liver disease was estimated by unconditional logistic regression model adjusted with age, sex, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). P < 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Mutation of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) pre-S 2 start codon was found in 59 samples from 268 subjects (22. 0 %), with higher prevalence in patients with cirrhosis 27 / 66 (40. 9 %) followed by HCC 18 / 63 (28. 6 %), chronic hepatitis 12 / 66 (18. 2 %) and asymptomatic carriers 2 / 73 (2. 7 %) (P < 0. 001). Logistic regression analysis showed that pre-S 2 start <b>codon</b> <b>mutation</b> was an independent factor for progressive liver disease. Other mutations, at T 130, Q 132, and A 138, were also associated with LC and HCC, although this was not statistically significant when adjusted for age, sex, and HBeAg. The prevalence of pre-S 2 start <b>codon</b> <b>mutation</b> was higher in HBV/B than in HBV/C (23. 0 % vs 19. 1 %), whilst the prevalence of T 130, Q 132, and A 138 mutation was higher in HBV/C than in HBV/B. The prevalence of pre-S 2 start <b>codon</b> <b>mutation</b> was higher in LC (38. 9 %) and HCC (40. 0 %) than CH (5. 6 %) in HBeAg(+) group, but it was similar between CH, LC and HCC in HBeAg(-) group.

Ninety-two percent of patients had core promoter or precore mutations after HBeAg seroconversion: 42 % had core promoter changes only, 38 % had precore stop codon mutations only, and 12 % had changes in both regions. Seventy-three percent of the patients had persistently normal aminotransferases, and only 8 % had multiple flares in aminotransferases after HBeAg seroconversion. Core promoter changes were significantly more common in patients infected with HBV who have C at nucleotide 1858 (91 % vs. 27 %; P <. 01), while precore stop codon changes were exclusively found in patients infected with HBV who have T at nucleotide 1858 (87 % vs. 0; P <. 01).

Candidate gene sequencing and genome-wide linkage analysis were used to disclose the molecular basis responsible for cerulean cataract in the family. Results: Initially, sequencing analysis of the three genes (beta-B 2 -crystallin [CRYBB 2], gamma-D-crystallin [CRYGD], and V-MAF avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog [MAF]) known to cause cerulean cataract failed to find any mutation. Then, genome-wide linkage analysis mapped the disease to chromosome 12 q 13 -q 22 between D 12 S 85 and D 12 S 351, with a maximum lod score of 4. 10 at θ= 0.

Thus, a consequence of these premature termination <b>codon</b> <b>mutations</b> in COL 7 A 1 is non-sense-mediated mRNA decay, with a dramatic reduction in type VII collagen synthesis, and the absence of anchoring fibrils in the proband. These results establish a mechanistic link between the presence of premature termination <b>codon</b> <b>mutations</b> in both alleles of COL 7 A 1 and the clinical phenotype of HS-RDEB...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 72 {{chromosomes}} from 36 Indonesian patients, 23 with beta-thalassemia major and 13 with Hb E-beta-thalassemia, {{were analyzed by}} specific oligonucleotide hybridization after DNA amplification. Thirteen had the beta E <b>mutation</b> (<b>codon</b> 26 GAG [...] AAG). Of the 59 -beta-thalassemic chromosomes, 32 were of the variant IVS- 1 nt 5 (G [...] C). Seven had the mutation IVS- 2 nt 654 (C [...] T), one had the <b>mutation</b> <b>codon</b> 41 / 42 (deletion CTTT), and one had the <b>mutation</b> <b>codon</b> 17 (AAG [...] TAG). Another six with the mutation IVS- 1 nt 1 (G [...] T), one with the mutation IVS- 1 nt 1 (G [...] A), four with the <b>mutation</b> <b>codon</b> 15 (TGG [...] TAG), one with a <b>mutation</b> <b>codon</b> 30 (AGG [...] ACG), and one with a <b>mutation</b> <b>codon</b> 35 (deletion C) were first identified by direct sequencing of a patient's genomic DNA followed by further hybridizing other patients' DNA with the appropriate oligonucleotide probes.

40|$|Pathogenic and {{therapeutic}} differences among hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes have been documented. However, {{the association of}} virological characteristics with clinical differences among HBV genotypes remains unclear. We therefore studied the clinical and virological characteristics of Taiwanese volunteer blood donors infected with HBV genotypes B and C. HBV genotypes were determined in 300 candidate blood donors positive for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), and sequences of the precore gene of the HBV genome were determined in 50 HBV e antigen (HBeAg) -positive and 50 HBeAg-negative blood donors. Of 300 HBsAg-positive blood donors, 10 % had elevated serum aminotransferase levels and 27 % were positive for HBeAg. HBV genotype distribution in 264 viremic carriers was as follows: B, 221 (83. 7 %); C, 39 (14. 8 %); F, 1 (0. 4 %); and mixed infection, 3 (1. 1 %). Blood donors with genotype C infection tended {{to have a higher}} frequency of HBeAg positivity and a higher serum HBV DNA level than those with genotype B infection. The frequency of precore stop <b>codon</b> <b>mutation</b> was significantly higher in HBeAg-negative blood donors than HBeAg-positive ones, irrespective of HBV genotypes. Meanwhile, only 5 % of blood donors with genotype C infection had C- 1858 strains. In conclusion, mixed infection of HBV genotypes indeed occurs, and genotype C has a higher serum HBV DNA level than genotype B. Precore stop <b>codon</b> <b>mutation</b> is common in HBeAg-negative HBV carriers, irrespective of HBV genotypes. In contrast, precore C- 1858 strains are rarely identified in Taiwanese HBV genotype C...|$|E
40|$|Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) {{is caused}} by {{defective}} assembly of keratin intermediate filaments in basal keratinocytes and recent studies indicated causal mutations in the keratin KRT 5 and KRT 14 genes. In this study, we describe a novel KRT 5 mutation in a German sporadic case of EBS Dowling–Meara. Transition of G to T (nucleotide position 2334) leads to a premature stop codon (E 477 stop, residue 93 of the 2 B helix) in the last residue of the highly conserved helix-termination peptide K/LLEGE of the 2 B rod domain of keratin K 5. This represents the first premature stop <b>codon</b> <b>mutation</b> identified within the K/LLEGE motif of any disorder reported so far that {{is caused by}} keratin mutations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mutations in {{the core}} {{promoter}} and precore regions of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome, notably the double substitution (AGG to TGA) at nt positions 1762 - 1764 {{in the core}} promoter, and the precore stop <b>codon</b> <b>mutation</b> G to A at nt 1896, can often explain the anti-HBe phenotype in chronic carriers. However, the A 1896 mutation is restricted to HBV isolates that have T at nt 1858. The double substitution at positions 1762 - 1764 has been described to occur preferentially in patients infected with strains showing C instead of T at nt 1858. Results HBV DNAs from 29 anti-HBe Brazilian samples were characterized by nucleotide sequencing of PCR products from precore region. Among them, 18 isolates presented C at nt 1858 (mostly genotype A strains). The 11 remaining isolates (genotypes D and F) had T 1858. The stop <b>codon</b> <b>mutation</b> at nt 1896 was found in seven isolates (24 % of the total and 63 % of the isolates that had T 1858). The frequency of the double substitution at positions 1762 - 1764 was surprisingly low (20 %) among C 1858 isolates. An association between A 1896 and TGA 1762 - 1764 mutations was observed among genotype D isolates: these showed either none of the two mutations or both. Furthermore, strains mutated at positions 1896 and/or 1762 - 1764 also presented an elevated number of other, less common substitutions in the core promoter and precore regions. Conclusions The data reported here are not in accordance with some reports {{from other parts of}} the world. In half of the isolates, none of the mutations previously described could explain the anti-HBe phenotype. </p...|$|E

METHODS <b>Codon</b> 249 <b>mutation</b> accompanied by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and its effect on trans-lation and transcription were studied using SSCP, IHC and RT-PCR/slot hybridization. RESULTS <b>Codon</b> 249 <b>mutations</b> were detected in 32. 9 %, LOH detected in 68. 4 % among the HCC patients. Mutations of condon 249 were accompa-nied by LOH in 90 %. The positive rates of p 53 pro-tein and mRNA were 91. 3 % and 95. 7 %, in muta-tional group, both were significantly higher than those in the non-mutational group (91. 3 % vs 19. 1 % and 95. 7 % vs 40. 4 %, respectively, both P < 0. 01). The translation of p 53 gene was strongly related to its transcription by correlation analysis (r = 0. 8208). CONCLUSIONS LOH might {{play an important role in}} hepatocarcinogenesis of <b>codon</b> 249 <b>mutation,</b> which could increase both transcription and transla-tion of p 53 gene. The increased expression of p 53 protein mainly depend on the increased transcription of p 53 gene...|$|R
40|$|Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in immune defense. We examined the MBL gene mutations and MBL levels in Chinese hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients with and without symptomatic cirrhosis. We recruited 190 hepatitis B and C patients, and 117 normal Chinese as controls. Serum MBL levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MBL gene <b>mutation</b> at <b>codons</b> 52, 54, and 57 was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. In asymptomatic hepatitis B and C patients, there was no increase in codons 52, 54, and 57 mutation, but the MBL levels were significantly lower than those in the controls. <b>Codon</b> 54 <b>mutation</b> rate was increased to 44. 4 % (P =. 007) in symptomatic hepatitis B cirrhosis and 64. 3 % (P =. 0026) in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). There was no increase in <b>codon</b> 54 <b>mutation</b> rate in hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In chronic hepatitis B infection, the odds ratio for an individual with <b>codon</b> 54 <b>mutation</b> to develop cirrhosis was 1. 84 (95 % CI: 1. 21 - 2. 81) and to develop SBP was 4. 58 (95 % CI: 1. 73 - 12. 16). Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection lowered the MBL levels, probably by suppressing MBL production. <b>Codon</b> 54 <b>mutation</b> of MBL was associated with progression of disease in chronic hepatitis B infection. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{reversion}} of HIS 4 initiator <b>codon</b> <b>mutations</b> in yeast {{has identified}} three unlinked genes, sui 1, sui 2, and SUI 3 (suppressors of initiator <b>codon</b> <b>mutations),</b> which when mutated confer {{the ability to}} initiate translation at HIS 4 {{despite the absence of}} an AUG start codon. We have previously demonstrated that the SUI 3 gene encodes the beta subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF- 2) and that mutations at a Zn(II) finger motif of SUI 3 alter the start site selection process in yeast. In this report, molecular and biochemical characterizations show that the sui 2 suppressor gene encodes the alpha subunit of eIF- 2. The amino acid sequence of sui 2 is 58 % homologous to that encoded by the cDNA of the human eIF- 2 alpha. Mutations in the sui 2 suppressor alleles occur in the amino-terminal portion of the protein and change amino acids that are identical at the same relative position in the yeast and human proteins. Protein sequence analysis shows that a sui 2 mutant yeast strain allows initiation at a UUG codon {{in the absence of an}} AUG codon at HIS 4. These data further suggest that eIF- 2 is an important component of the preinitiation complex that mediates ribosomal recognition of a start codon during the scanning process...|$|R
