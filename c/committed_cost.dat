40|$|This paper quantifies {{the effect}} of {{architectural}} design decisions {{on the performance of}} TxLinux. TxLinux is a Linux kernel modified to use transactions in place of locking primitives in several key subsystems. We run TxLinux on MetaTM, which is a new hardware transaction memory (HTM) model. MetaTM contains features that enable efficient and correct interrupt handling for an x 86 -like architecture. Live stack overwrites can corrupt non-transactional stack memory and requires a small change to the transaction register checkpoint hardware to ensure correct operation of the operating system. We also propose stackbased early release to reduce spurious conflicts on stack memory between kernel code and interrupt handlers. We use MetaTM to examine the performance sensitivity of individual architectural features. For TxLinux we find that Polka and SizeMatters are effective contention management policies, some form of backoff on transaction contention is vital for performance, and stalling on a transaction conflict reduces transaction restart rates, but does not improve performance. Transaction write sets are small, and performance is insensitive to transaction abort costs but sensitive to <b>commit</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R

Some years ago, before the invention of the Capability Maturity Model ® (CMM®) and CMM IntegrationSM (CMMI®) the prin-cipal problem was the lack of plans [1, 2]. In the early years, I never saw a failed proj-ect that had a plan, and very few unplanned projects were successful. The methods defined for CMM and CMMI Levels 2 and 3 helped to address this problem. As the Standish data in Figure 1 shows, the success rate for soft-ware organizations improved between 1994 and 2000, and much of this improvement was due to more widespread use of sound project management practices [3]. Still, with less than 30 percent of our projects successful, those of us who are software professionals have little to be proud of. The definition of a successful project is one that completed within 10 percent or so of its <b>committed</b> <b>cost</b> and schedule and delivered all of its intended functions. Challenged projects are ones that were seriously late or over costs or had reduced functions. Failed projects never delivered anything. Figure 2 (see page 26) shows another cut of the Standish data by project size. When looked at this way, half of the smallest projects succeeded, while none of the largest projects did. Since large proj-ects still do not succeed even with all of the project management improvements of the last several years, one begins to wonder if large-scale software projects are inher-ently unmanageable...|$|E

A year-long period of public hearings and study by an Ontario government all-party committee finished in 1986 with the decision {{to proceed with the}} project, which had then risen to $7 billion in actual and <b>committed</b> <b>costs.</b> The final cost was $14.4 billion CAD, almost double the initial construction budget. The project was adversely affected by declining electricity demand forecasts, mounting debt of Ontario Hydro, and the Chernobyl disaster which necessitated safety reviews in mid-construction. Each delay incurred interest charges on debt, which ultimately accounted for 70% of the cost overruns. Inflation during 1977 to 1981 was 46 percent, according to Canada's Consumer Price index. In addition interest rates were running at 20 percent. Improper choice of equipment and a six-month labour stoppage of electrical workers also yielded some of these costs and delays. Discussion of who is to blame for the costs and subsequent debts associated with Darlington often arise during provincial election campaigns, and are often mentioned in anti-nuclear literature.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} to present theoretical hypothesis why the education board system has stabilized. The most commonly accepted {{view is that the}} intention of the Ministry of Education, because it is able to control the board of education. This opinion also said that the governor, the mayor and the local assembly could not concern about education. This viewpoint, however, cannot explain why they had power when the law concerning the organization and functions of local educational administration was enacted. To solve this problem, this article presents this hypothesis; the reason why the education board system has stabilized is the rational choice of the governor, the mayor and the local assembly. The hypothesis uses the theory of transaction cost approach and path dependence. Transaction costs consists of four costs, legislative decision-making <b>costs,</b> <b>commit</b> problem, agency <b>costs,</b> the cost of uncertainty. The governor and the mayor and the local assembly, act to minimize the sum of transaction costs. Under the circumstance of the politics of education in Japan by the middle of 1990 's, they chose to exist the education board system, which was independent of general administration. They delegate educational administration to the education board and didn't commit by themselves. In addition, path dependence makes more difficult to change the system.

Recent advances in the state of the art in systems engineering methodology can be leveraged to address this growing challenge. The present work leverages advanced constructs and methods for early-phase conceptual design of complex systems, when <b>committed</b> <b>costs</b> are still low and management influence is still high. First, a literature review is presented of the topics relevant to this work, including approaches to the design of affordable systems, assumptions and methods of exploratory modeling, and enabling techniques to help mitigate the computational challenges involved. The types, purposes, and limits of early-phase, exploratory models are then elucidated. The RSC-based Method for Affordable Concept Selection (RMACS) is described, which comprises nine processes in the three main thrusts of information gathering, evaluation, and analysis. The method is then applied to a naval ship case example, described as the Next-Generation Combat Ship, with representational information outputs and discussions of affordability with respect to each process. The ninth process, Multi-Era Analysis (MERA), is introduced and explicated, including required and optional informational components, temporal and change-related considerations, required and optional activities involved, and the potential types of outputs from the process. The MERA process is then applied to a naval ship case example similar to that of the RMACS application, but with discrete change options added to enable a tradespace network. The seven activities of the MERA process are demonstrated, with the salient outputs of each given and discussed. Additional thoughts are presented on MERA and RMACS, and 8 distinct areas are identified for further research in the MERA process, along with a brief description of the directions that such research might take. It is concluded that the affordability of complex systems can be better enabled through a conceptual design method that incorporates MERA as well as metrics such as Multi-Attribute Expense, Max Expense, and Expense Stability. It is also found that affordability of changeable systems can be better enabled through the use of existing path-planning algorithms in efficient evaluation and analysis of long-term strategies. Finally, it is found that MERA enables the identification and analysis of path-dependent considerations related to designs, epochs, strategies, and change options, in many possible futures. by Michael Andrew Schaffner.
