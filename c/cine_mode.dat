Entrance surface air kerma (ESAK) and scatter doses were measured on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantoms of different thicknesses (from 4 to 16 cm). The ESAK values for the different acquisition modes and PMMA thicknesses were higher for the II in comparison with FDs. For the II, the scatter dose rates ranged from 0. 67 to 12. 2 mSv h(- 1) at the eye position of the cardiologist during fluoroscopy and <b>cine</b> <b>modes.</b> At the lower extremities, these values were 1. 11 and 24. 24 mSv h(- 1). In {{the case of the}} FDs, these values ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 67 mSv h(- 1) for eye lens and from 0. 73 to 2. 01 mSv h(- 1) for the position of cardiologist's ankle. The newly installed X-ray system showed an average reduction factor of up to 9. 7 times for ESAK values.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to {{evaluate}} interventional radiology x-ray system performance in order to analyze its influence on patient dose. Entrance air kerma rate in fluoroscopy modes and aire kerma per image in <b>cine</b> <b>modes</b> were measured at the entrance of PMMA slabs (10 to 30 cm) in two interventional x-ray systems. Air kerma evaluation was performed in all image intensifiers (II) diameters and in all fluoroscopy and <b>cine</b> <b>modes</b> used in the clinical practice with an ionization chamber. High and low contrast resolution was evaluated for all PMMA thickness, II and modes, with two quality image tests (NEMA XR 21 and Leeds TOR- 18 FG). Significant differences were found in air kerma rate and air kerma per image in both x-ray systems for comparable II and modes. For example, for 24 cm PMMA thickness in fluoroscopic high dose mode, in one x-ray system delivers 0. 49 mGy/s and the other one 1. 87 mGy/s. However, differences in image quality were not significant. In the same conditions described above, Leeds test showed: 0. 032 (low contrast) and 1. 25 lpmm (spatial frequency). In addition, when phantom thickness increase, image quality decreases in x-ray systems, but in one of them, the difference is high. Results show that patient dose and image quality depend on the x-ray system characteristics. Due to this it is essential to perform a complete evaluation of the x-ray system in order to help interventional cardiologists (radiologists) to learn possibilities of dose reduction with no lose of image quality.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} dynamic {{features}} of the medial rectus capsulopalpebral fascia (mrCPF) and the lateral rectus CPF (lrCPF) during horizontal eye movements using <b>cine</b> <b>mode</b> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). DESIGN: Observational case series. PARTICIPANTS: Ten patients (9 males and 1 female; age range, 8 - 75 years; mean age, 41. 1 years) diagnosed with a unilateral orbital blowout fracture (medial wall, floor, or both) and having a normal contralateral orbit. METHODS: <b>Cine</b> <b>mode</b> MRI {{was used to examine}} the role of the mrCPF and the lrCPF in relation to the eyelid and horizontal recti muscles during horizontal eye movements. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To assess the dynamic {{features of the}} mrCPF and the lrCPF. RESULTS: In medial gaze, the medial part of the eyelid moves posteromedially, in synchronicity with medial rectus muscle contraction, mediated by the mrCPF. The lateral part of the eyelid moves anteromedially, in synchronicity with lateral rectus muscle relaxation, mediated by the lrCPF. In lateral gaze, the lateral part of the eyelid moves posterolaterally, in synchronicity with the lateral rectus muscle contraction, mediated by the lrCPF. The medial part of the eyelid moves anterolaterally, in synchronicity with medial rectus muscle relaxation, mediated by the mrCPF. These findings were demonstrated in all 10 patients. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Cine</b> <b>mode</b> MRI was used to demonstrate the dynamic roles of the mrCPF and the lrCPF in mediating eyelid position with the corresponding horizontal recti muscles. This study may allow {{a better understanding of the}} importance of these anatomic structures and may reduce functional and cosmetic complications during common oculoplastic and strabismus surgeries.

Purpose: In this feasibility report we want to demonstrate the potential use of functional MRI in monitoring gastric filling, patient satiation and gastric emptying in a obese patient who previously received intragastric balloon placement. Material and methods: We selected one patient (male, 178 cm, 127 kg, BMI = 40, 5 kg/m 2) who recently received a gastric balloon and visualized gastric motility in presence of the gastric balloon before and after food intake. Fast cross-sectional images in one breathhold spin echo or gradient echo sequences were aquired. Real-time gastric motion was performed with <b>cine</b> <b>mode.</b> Results: MRI offers perfect visualisation of gastric balloons in obese patients. Gastric filling and emptying can be monitored in correlation to patient satiety sensation. MRI can visualize the gastric balloon with degree of filling and possible leakages. <b>Cine</b> <b>mode</b> sequences demonstrate gastric motility and gastric wall peristalsis.

A set of images was acquired for each arc irradiation using the EPID <b>cine</b> acquisition <b>mode,</b> that supplies a frame acquisition {{rate of one}} image every 1. 66 s, with a monitor unit rate equal to 100 UM/min. In these conditions good signal stability, +/- 1 % (2 SD) evaluated during 3 months, signal reproducibility within +/- 0. 8 % (2 SD) and linearity with dose and dose rate within +/- 1 % (2 SD) were obtained. The transit signal, S (t), due to the transmitted radiotherapy beam below a solid phantom, measured by the EPID <b>cine</b> acquisition <b>mode</b> was used to determine, (1) a set of correlation functions, F(w, L), defined as the ratio between S (t) and the dose at half thickness, D (m), measured in solid water phantoms of different thicknesses, w and with square fields of side L, (2) a set of factors, f(d, L), that {{take into account the}} different x-ray scatter contribution from the phantom to the S (t) signal {{as a function of the}} variation, d, of the air gap between the phantom and the EPID.

The figure of merit (FOM) was defined as the squared signal to noise ratio divided by a patient dose related parameter. An in house constructed phantom simulated a series of vessel segments with iodine concentrations from 10 % or 30  mg/cc to 16 % or 48  mg/cc of iodine in a blood plasma solution, all within the dimensional constraints of a paediatric patient. The phantom also used test inserts of tin (Sn). Measurements of Entrance Surface Air Kerma (ESAK) and exit dose rate were performed along with calculations of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of all the objects. A first result showed that it was favourable to employ low dose fluoroscopy mode and lower frame rate <b>modes</b> in <b>cine</b> acquisition if dynamic information is not critical. Normal fluoroscopy dose mode provided a considerably higher dose level (in comparison to low dose mode) with only a slight improvement in SNR.

Materials and Methods: The performance of an a-Si EPID operated in <b>cine</b> <b>mode</b> was assessed and compared to its performance when operated in an integrated mode and dose measurements using an ionization chamber. This study was conducted at different photon energies and the EPID performance was assessed as function of the delivered dose, dose rate, multileaf collimator speed, field size, phantom thickness, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy fields. Results: The worst nonlinearity was observed at low monitor unit (MU) settings &lt; 100 MU with the highest dose per frame. The nonlinearity of response at a low MU setting was attributed due {{to the loss of}} four cine images during each delivery. The EPID response with changing dose rate for 10 MU delivered had similar results to its performance in an integrated mode and ionization chamber. Despite the nonlinearity of response with low MU delivered, EPID performance operated in cine and integrated acquisition modes had comparable responses within 2 %.

40|$|Purpose: Electronic portal imaging devices(EPIDs) {{have been}} studied and used for {{pretreatment}} and in-vivo dosimetry applications for many years. The application of EPIDs for dosimetry in arc treatments requires accurate characterization of the mechanical sag of the EPID and gantry during rotation. Several studies have investigated the effects of gravity on the sag of these systems but each have limitations. In this study, an easy experiment setup and accurate algorithm have been introduced to characterize and correct for the effect of EPID and gantry sag during arc delivery. Methods: Three metallic ball bearings were used as markers in the beam: two of them fixed to the gantry head and the third positioned at the isocenter. EPIDimages were acquired during a 360 ° gantry rotation in <b>cine</b> imaging <b>mode.</b> The markers were tracked in EPIDimages and a robust in-house developedMATLAB code was used to analyse the images and find the EPID sag in three directions {{as well as the}} EPID[*]+[*]gantry sag by comparison to the reference gantry zero image. The algorithm results were then tested against independent methods. The method was applied to compare the effect in clockwise and counter clockwise gantry rotations and different source-to-detector distances (SDDs). The results were monitored for one linear accelerator over a course of 15 months and six other linear-accelerators from two treatment centers were also investigated using this method. The generalized shift patterns were derived from the data and used in an image registration algorithm to correct for the effect of the mechanical sag in the system. The Gamma evaluation (3 %, 3 mm) technique was used to investigate the improvement in alignment of cine EPIDimages of a fixed field, by comparing both individual images and the sum of images in a series with the reference gantry zero image. Results: The mechanical sag during gantry rotation was dependent on the gantry angle and was larger in the in-plane direction, although the patterns were not identical for various linear-accelerators. The reproducibility of measurements was within 0. 2 mm over a period of 15 months. The direction of gantry rotation and SDD did not affect the results by more than 0. 3 mm. Results of independent tests agreed with the algorithm within the accuracy of the measurement tools. When comparing summed images, the percentage of points with Gamma index < 1 increased from 85. 4 % to 94. 1 % after correcting for the EPID sag, and to 99. 3 % after correction for gantry[*]+[*]EPID sag. Conclusions: The measurement method and algorithms introduced in this study use cine-images, are highly accurate, simple, fast, and reproducible.

30|$|Each patient {{underwent}} an FDG PET/CT study scan for radiotherapy simulation purposes. Patients were injected intravenously with 460 [*]±[*] 17  MBq (range, 429 – 477  MBq) of FDG, after a fasting {{period of}} ≥ 6  h. PET scans were acquired for 3  min/bed position, at 100 [*]±[*] 38  min (range, 60 – 171  min) post-injection (pi). All PET data were acquired in 3 D mode on a General Electric Discovery ST PET/CT (GE Health Care Inc.). A CT acquired in <b>cine</b> <b>mode</b> (140  kVp, 10  mA, 5.0 -mm slice thickness, 0.5 -s tube rotation) was averaged (CTavg) {{and used for}} attenuation correction of PET images. The cine duration was set to match the patient breathing period plus 1  s (~ 6  s on average). PET emission data were corrected for attenuation, scatter, and random events and reconstructed into 128 [*]×[*] 128 [*]×[*] 47 matrix (voxel dimensions 5.47 [*]×[*] 5.47 [*]×[*] 3.27  mm). The reconstruction was performed using the GE ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm with standard clinical reconstruction parameters: 2 iterations, 16 subsets, and 6.0  mm full width at half maximum Gaussian post-filter.|$|E
40|$|New imaging {{sequences}} {{with increasing}} {{spatial and temporal}} resolution are introduced frequently in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to perform noninvasive angiography both with and without contrast media for the enhancement of the vessels. These new sequences produce a growing amount of data to be evaluated by the radiologist to form the diagnosis. Because of the growing amount of data and thus the growing amount of slices, more and more images are reconstructed and either printed on film or viewed on a diagnostic workstation. When a diagnostic work-station is used the radiologist most frequently uses the stack or <b>cine</b> <b>mode</b> view of the slices, but other techniques like Multi Planar Reformatting (MPR), Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP), Surface Rendering (SR), and Volume Rendering (VR) are also available to process the data. When using these techniques, the radiologist needs to interact closely with the data to obtain optimal views {{and in some cases}} special purpose workstations are required {{to be able to use}} them. In this article an overview of available techniques is presented. The technique itself, its advantages and disadvantages, and the (possible) clinical applications are discussed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain {{pulsation}} is {{a well-known}} observation in neurosurgery, but meth-ods for its visualization on MR imaging, like phase imaging, do not provide a detailed structural view. We prospectively investigated electrocardiographic (ECG) -gated cine true fast imaging with steady-state precession (FISP) sequence on volunteers to test a sequence for demonstrating brain pulsation and movements of intracranial structures related to CSF dynamics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven healthy volunteers were investigated with prospectively ECG-gated cine true-FISP in the midsagittal plane. A total of 50 phases were recorded per cardiac cycle and per volunteer. The lamina terminalis was chosen to study the pulsatility of the brain, and the optic recess diameter was chosen for means of objective quantification {{of the degree of}} pulsatility. RESULTS: Pulsatile motion of the lamina terminalis was apparent in all volunteers on the <b>cine</b> <b>mode.</b> The mean diameter of the optic recess was 2. 5 mm. The greatest change in diameter in 1 volunteer was 1. 5 mm. The mean change in diameter was 40 % during 1 cardiac cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Cine true-FISP sequence is a well-suited method for investigations of passive move-ments of the ventricular system. It shows pulsations of the brain as well as passive changes caused by CSF dynamics with high temporal and spatial resolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{differences}} in visualization of the intrahepatic portal system among different imaging planes obtained by two-dimensional (2 D) -time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was examined comparatively. Ten healthy volunteers {{were subjected to}} 2 D-TOF-MRA of the entire liver from three directions — sagittal, transverse and coronal — during breath-holding using 2 D-fast low angle shot sequences. Using the obtained consecutive image data, MRA was reconstructed by the maximum intensity projection algorithm. MRA was observed in a <b>cine</b> <b>mode</b> display, and visualization of each portal branch was classified into 3 groups: A, B and C (excellent, fair and poor, respectively). The visualization rate from the portal vein trunk to the segmental branches in the right lobe excluding the right anterior superior branch was highest on the sagittal section. The visualization rate of each branch in the left lobe was low as a whole on images taken from the 3 directions; a particularly low rate {{was found on the}} transverse images so all of these cases were classified into Group C. In conclusion, for visualizing from the portal vein trunk to the branches in the right hepatic lobe as a whole, the sagittal section was good, but visualization of branches in the left lobe wa...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 3 D-CT {{angiography}} (3 D-CTA), a vessel-cast technique, {{is useful}} in the diagnosis of patients with brain lesions and cerebrovascular disease. However, it provides no infor-mation on blood-flow dynamics. Therefore, we developed a new technique, dynamic 3 D-CTA (d 3 D-CTA), that yields 3 D images of the vasculature and allows assessment of the hemodynamics and of the cerebral perfusion. METHODS: We subjected 12 patients to d 3 D-CTA; 7 had brain tumors, 4 had arteriovenous malfor-mations (AVMs), and 1 presented with cervical internal carotid artery occlusion. d 3 D-CTA was per-formed with a multidetector-row CT scanner with 64 detectors; the parameters were 0. 5 -mm section thickness, 0. 5 seconds per rotation, 135 kV, and 150 mA. Contrast medium (total volume, 30 – 35 mL) was injected at 6 – 7 mL/s; scanning was started after a 5 -second delay. Scans were generated with volume-rendering reconstruction and displayed in <b>cine</b> <b>mode.</b> RESULTS: We succeeded in obtaining d 3 D-CTA scans in all cases. The scans yielded 3 D information on the vascular structures and hemodynamics and {{on the status of}} the cerebral perfusion. CONCLUSION: d 3 D-CTA facilitates the acquisition of information on the vascular and cerebral dynamic blood flow on 3 D-CTA images. Despite the relatively high radiation exposure and contrast injectio...|$|E
40|$|Aim:to {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} the number of preoperative patent side branches and {{the presence or absence of}} postoperative endoleaks, and to study the fate of patent branches after operation. Patients and Methods:thirty consecutive patients were included. <b>Cine</b> <b>mode</b> viewing of axial CT angiography images was applied to detect infrarenal aortic side branches. The position of side branches relative to the renal arteries, branch patency and run-off pathways were studied. Results:a total of 160 patent side branches were found. All patients had two or more patent side branches. A patent inferior mesenteric artery was found in 22 / 30 patients (73 %). Postoperative CT scans revealed major endoleaks in five patients (16 %) and minor endoleaks in eight (27 %). There was no significant difference in the number of preoperative patent side branches in patients with a completely thrombosed aneurysm sac (five; range 2 – 8) compared to patients with postoperative endoleaks (six; range 3 – 9; p = 0. 12). Backbleeding from patent side branches as the sole cause of endoleak was seen in one patient only (3. 3 %). Conclusion:postoperative endoleaks are not related to the number of preoperative patent side branches. In patients without endoleaks, contrast enhancement of side branches was repeatedly seen in the vicinity of the aneurysm wall. Although close follow-up of these branches is warranted, they did not affect the outcome of endovascular aneurysm repair...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a non-invasive method to monitor the motion of internal organs affected by respiration without using external markers or spirometry, to test the correlation with external markers, and to calculate any time shift between the datasets. Ten lung cancer patients were CT scanned with a GE LightSpeed Plus 4 -Slice CT scanner operating in a <b>ciné</b> <b>mode.</b> We retrospectively reconstructed the raw CT data to obtain consecutive 0. 5 s reconstructions at 0. 1 s intervals to increase image sampling. We defined regions of interest containing tissue interfaces, including tumour/lung interfaces that move due to breathing on multiple axial slices and measured the mean CT number versus respiratory phase. Tumour motion was directly correlated with external marker motion, acquired simultaneously, using the sample coefficient of determination, r(2). Only three of the ten patients showed correlation higher than r(2) = 0. 80 between tumour motion and external marker position. However, after taking into account time shifts (ranging between 0 s and 0. 4 s) between the two data sets, all ten patients showed correlation better than r(2) = 0. 8. This non-invasive method for monitoring the motion of internal organs is an effective tool that can assess the use of external markers for 4 D-CT imaging and respiratory-gated radiotherapy on a patient-specific basis...|$|E
40|$|Four-dimensional {{computed}} tomography (4 D-CT) imaging {{technology has been}} developed for radiation therapy to provide tumor and organ images at the different breathing phases. In this work, a procedure is proposed for estimating and modeling the respiratory motion field from acquired 4 D-CT imaging data and predicting tissue motion at the different breathing phases. The 4 D-CT image data consist of series of multislice CT volume segments acquired in <b>ciné</b> <b>mode.</b> A modified optical flow deformable image registration algorithm is used to compute the image motion from the CT segments to a common full volume 3 D-CT reference. This reference volume is reconstructed using the acquired 4 D-CT data at the end-of-exhalation phase. The segments are optimally aligned to the reference volume according to a proposed a priori alignment procedure. The registration is applied using a multigrid approach and a feature-preserving image downsampling maxfilter to achieve better computational speed and higher registration accuracy. The registration accuracy is about 1. 1 ± 0. 8 mm for the lung region according to our verification using manually selected landmarks and artificially deformed CT volumes. The estimated motion fields are fitted to two 5 D (spatial 3 D+tidal volume+airflow rate) motion models: forward model and inverse model. The forward model predicts tissue movements and the inverse model predicts CT density changes {{as a function of}} tidal volume and airflow rate. A leave-one-out procedure is used to validate these motion models. The estimated modeling prediction errors are about 0. 3 mm for the forward model and 0. 4 mm for the inverse model...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory motion during {{percutaneous}} radiotherapy can {{be considered}} based on respiration-correlated computed tomography (4 DCT). However, most treatment planning systems perform the dose calculation based on a single primary CT data set, even though <b>cine</b> <b>mode</b> displays may allow for a visualisation of the complete breathing cycle. This might create the mistaken impression that the dose distribution were independent of tumour motion. We present a movie visualisation technique with the aim to direct {{attention to the fact}} that the dose distribution migrates to some degree with the tumour and discuss consequences for gated treatment, IMRT plans and flattening-filter-free beams. This is a feasibility test for a visualisation of tumour and isodose motion. Ten respiratory phases are distinguished on the CT, and the dose distribution from a stationary IMRT plan is calculated on each phase, to be integrated into a movie of tumour and dose motion during breathing. For one example patient out of the sample of five lesions, the plan is compared with a gated treatment plan with respect to tumour coverage and lung sparing. The interplay-effect for small segments in the IMRT plan is estimated. While the high dose rate, together with the cone-shaped beam profile, makes the use of flattening-filter-free beams more problematic for conformal and IMRT treatment, it can be the option of choice if gated treatment is preferred. The different effects of respiratory motion, dose build-up and beam properties (segments and flatness) for gated vs. un-gated treatment can best be considered if planning is performed on the full 4 DCT data set, which may be an incentive for futur...|$|E
