40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study performed in order to develop a dynamic model of radiant <b>ceiling</b> <b>panels</b> in <b>heating</b> or cooling modes coupled to its environment (fenestration, walls, internal loads and ventilation system). The model considers the radiant panels as a dynamic-state finned heat exchanger connected to a detailed lumped dynamic model of the building (R-C network). The behavior of the radiant ceiling system and the interactions with its environment has been experimentally and numerically evaluated. Using as inputs the radiant ceiling and room dimensions, material properties and the transient measurements of air temperature at the adjacent zones, supply air and water temperatures and mass flow rates, the model allows for the estimation of the water exhaust temperature, radiant ceiling average surface temperature, resultant and dry air room temperatures, radiant ceiling power and internal surface temperatures of the room in order to compare with measurements taken during the commissioning process. Two dynamic tests in heating and cooling modes are used to validate the model. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLow {{temperature}} <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> systems offer distinctive {{advantages in}} terms of thermal comfort and energy consumption, allowing work with low exergy sources. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to compare floor, wall, <b>ceiling,</b> and floor-ceiling <b>panel</b> <b>heating</b> systems {{in terms of}} energy, exergy and CO 2 emissions. Simulation results for each of the analyzed panel system are given by its energy (the consumption of gas for heating, electricity for pumps and primary energy) and exergy consumption, the price of heating, and its carbon dioxide emission. Then, the values of the air temperatures of rooms are investigated and that of the surrounding walls and floors. It is found that the floor-ceiling heating system has the lowest energy, exergy, CO 2 emissions, operating costs, and uses boiler of the lowest power. The worst system by all these parameters is the classical ceiling heatin...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the radiant <b>heat</b> effect of <b>ceiling</b> <b>panels</b> in the operating zone and therefore the thermal comfort in high rooms has been proven. The stability of thermal layers has to be tested {{and it has to}} be proven that the convection from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>panels</b> does not flow down into the operating zone. All the currents are shown with a CFD-based simulation. To increase the quality of the results and to control the transferability, the model of a standard <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel</b> is initially simulated under the conditions according to DIN 4706 in a testing booth. This would be then compared with current tests and infrared thermographs of a DIN test before simulating the <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel</b> in a real room. This room would be of a style consistent with a typical industrial building. Upon receiving the results, an evaluated <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel,</b> with an increased percentage of radiant output, is to be developed, taking into consideration the resulting theoretical and practical knowledge. By the use of these former results, the <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel</b> fitted at high level within a typical industrial building is simulated to show and prove the air currents under working condition. Changes of several components of the evaluated <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel</b> are simulated under the condition of DIN 4706 to prove the influence on the percentage of the radiation output. All the simulations are the basics for an equation for an expenditure number. This expenditure number can be used for all types of rooms and <b>ceiling</b> <b>panels</b> and gives information about the energy consumption. (orig.)

40|$|International audienceWell {{known in}} the North of Europe, the water <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel</b> systems are mainly used to provide cooling. However, {{as well as for}} a radiant floor, this system can be used for heating in winter and cooling in summer. In order to get a better {{knowledge}} of the energy performances of such devices, the Gaz de France Research Centre funded a test campaign during two winters and one summer. This experimental study was carried out in our laboratory, located in Rennes, in western France. A water <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel</b> system and a monitory data acquisition system were installed in a test room. The studied <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel</b> system was made of copper pipes with rigid aluminium diffusion fins. The used materials presented a good heating conductivity and the <b>ceiling</b> radiant <b>panel</b> was fast-acting. Simulation models were developed with the simulation program TRNSYS, using the experimental study results for the code verification...|$|R

40|$|In {{the scope}} of this paper a novel {{actively}} controlled <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel</b> cooling system is developed. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel</b> consists of phase change materials and metal fins. In recent years phase change materials (PCM) have been extensively researched in different application areas, starting from product packaging and clothing to wide variety of applications within the buildings for temperature fluctuation reduction. In most cases PCM are used to achieve effective passive cooling by enhancing the thermal capacity and thermal inertia of buildings who are made of lightweight constructions. These systems although are effective for temperature fluctuation reduction, they don’t provide comfortable indoor climatic conditions, because often too high temperatures are reached and additional cooling loads need to be operated to overcome this shortcoming. To achieve more comfortable indoor climate conditions and to lower the indoor temperature a mathematical model is developed to examine the phase change temperature influence on the temperature profile on the <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel</b> surface. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} office cooling systems {{based on}} all air mixing ventilation systems alone or coupled with radiant <b>ceiling</b> <b>panels.</b> This last solution may be effectively applied to retrofit all air systems that are {{no longer able to}} maintain a suitable thermal comfort in the indoor environment, for example in offices with high thermal loads. This study was performed by means of CFD simulations previously validated through an experimental campaign performed in a full scale test room, simulating a typical two-desk office equipped with an all air mixing ventilation system. The numerical studies were then extended to the coupled mixing ventilation and cold radiant <b>ceiling</b> <b>panels.</b> In particular, attention was drawn on the evaluation of the main supply jet properties (throw and penetration length) and on the draft risk caused by the cold air drop into the occupied zone. The study shows that such a problem can be effectively reduced applying cold radiant <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel...</b>|$|R
40|$|This work, {{carried out}} at the Pisa University, deals with the energy {{performance}} study of a single family house located in Campo nell'Elba (north-central Italy) with the aim to develop a series of improvements to reduce energy consumption and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. The paper gives a brief presentation {{of the house and}} of the energy-saving measures. It also presents results of the total energy consumption (according to the energy performance requirements introduced in Italy in 2006) including specific uses, the improvements introduced with the adopted energy-saving measures and a benefit-cost analysis to assess the most economical action to be performed. In {{the second part of the}} paper, radiant floor and <b>ceiling</b> <b>panels</b> were investigated by means of Computational Fluid Dynamic analysis using the AnsysFluent CFD commercial code.
