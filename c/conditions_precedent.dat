25|$|Contractual {{terms are}} {{classified}} differently {{depending upon the}} context or jurisdiction. Terms establish <b>conditions</b> <b>precedent.</b> English (but not necessarily non-English) common law distinguishes between important conditions and warranties, with a breach of a condition by one party allowing the other to repudiate and be discharged while a warranty allows for remedies and damages but not complete discharge. Whether or not a term is a condition is determined {{in part by the}} parties' intent.|$|E
25|$|There {{are certain}} <b>conditions</b> <b>precedent,</b> or defenses, to a {{recovery}} of damages for a person's failure to testify, or to provide documents pertinent to a hearing or trial. There {{must be a}} breach of testimonial duty, after having been properly served with a legitimately executed subpoena. There must be a demonstration of actual damages incurred from the absence of testimony. Most courts have rejected the arguments for seeking damages {{in this kind of}} case. Giving false testimony in a judicial proceeding even though the allegation is made that the person giving the testimony knew it to be false, does not give rise, either at common law or by statute, to a civil action for damages, resulting from such testimony. The situation is probably different if intentionally false documents are submitted under a subpoena duces tecum.|$|E
50|$|A <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> is {{an event}} or state of affairs that is {{required}} before something else will occur. In contract law, a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> {{is an event}} which must occur, unless its non-occurrence is excused, before performance under a contract becomes due, i.e., before any contractual duty exists.|$|R
50|$|For comparison, a {{condition}} subsequent brings {{a duty to}} an end whereas a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> initiates a duty.|$|R

50|$|A general {{ruling that}} can be gleaned from the court's {{judgment}} is that in circumstances where parties have equal knowledge as {{to the existence of}} the subject matter, {{and it turned out to}} be false, then it would justify the implication of a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent.</b> In that case, the contract would be void for the failure of the <b>condition</b> <b>precedent,</b> and parties would be restored to their original position. However, in a case where only one party has knowledge of the subject matter (such as the present circumstances), and the other simply relies on what the first party intimates, then there could be no <b>condition</b> <b>precedent.</b> The first party promises or guarantees the existence of the subject matter and will be in breach if it does not exist.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the fourth}} appeal the Court of Appeal had to {{consider}} a Master Agreement where the parties had selected automatic early termination (AET). They had to therefore consider a separate point raised whereby whether the AET provisions necessarily assumed that all <b>conditions</b> <b>precedent</b> were satisfied (i.e. amongst other things, there was no Event of Default) {{for the purposes of}} carrying out the calculation of the amounts payable (defined as [...] "Loss" [...] under the agreement). The Court framed the question thus: [...] "is Bulk as the Non-defaulting Party obliged to calculate its loss by reference to sums which would have become due to Britannia Bulk had Britannia Bulk not remained subject to an Event of Default after Automatic Early Termination?" [...] The Court held not, and upheld the existing line of authority on this point, most notably in the decision of Gloster J in Pioneer Freight Co Ltd v TMT Asia Ltd 2011 2 Lloyds Rep 96. [...] In line with its decision on the earlier points in the decision, the Court of Appeal held that absence of a condition precedent preventing the payment mechanism working, but it did not otherwise affect the underlying debt accruing and being calculated in accordance with the terms of the agreement.|$|E
