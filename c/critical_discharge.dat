Given the fact that instream discharge, among meteorological and hydrologicaï factors, {{may be the only}} one that can be practically managed, is it feasible to moderate summer river temperature through reservoir and streamflow regulations? An analysis is conducted to quantify the effects of the magnitude of instream flow on summer river temperature with weather as a reference. Relationships between water temperature and river discharge or flow depth are developed using a simplified model and adopting the concept of equilibrium temperature and bulk surface heat exchange coefficient. The relationships are validated against continuous 5 -year field measurements at the central Platte River, Nebraska, USA. It was found that the variation of daily maximum water temperature with flow was stronger than that of daily mean.

40|$|International audienceThe use {{of weather}} {{ensemble}} predictions in ensemble flood forecasting is an acknowledged procedure {{to include the}} uncertainty of meteorological forecasts in a probabilistic streamflow prediction system. Operational flood forecasters can thus get {{an overview of the}} probability of exceeding a <b>critical</b> <b>discharge</b> or water level, and decide on whether a flood warning should be issued or not. This process offers several challenges to forecasters: 1) how to define critical thresholds along all the rivers under survey? 2) How to link locally defined thresholds to simulated discharges, which result from models with specific spatial and temporal resolutions? 3) How to define the number of ensemble forecasts predicting the exceedance of critical thresholds necessary to launch a warning? This study focuses on this third challenge. We investigate the optimal number of ensemble members exceeding a <b>critical</b> <b>discharge</b> in order to issue a flood warning. The optimal probabilistic threshold is the one that minimizes the number of false alarms and misses, while it optimizes the number of flood events correctly forecasted. Furthermore, in our study, an optimal probabilistic threshold also maximizes flood preparedness: the gain in lead-time compared to a deterministic forecast. Data used to evaluate critical thresholds for ensemble flood forecasting come from a selection of 208 catchments in France, which covers a wide range of the hydroclimatic conditions (including catchment size) encountered in the country. The GRP hydrological forecasting model, a lumped soil-moisture-accounting type rainfall-runoff model, is used. The model is driven by the 10 -day ECMWF deterministic and ensemble (51 members) precipitation forecasts for a period of 18 months. A trade-off between the number of hits, misses, false alarms and the gain in lead time is sought to find the optimal number of ensemble members exceeding the <b>critical</b> <b>discharge.</b> These optimal probability thresholds are further explored in order to search for correlations with catchment characteristics, forecast lead-time and discharge thresholds...|$|E
40|$|Concentration rating curves {{are useful}} for the {{analysis}} of the responseof sediment or solute concentrations to changes in stream discharge orfor the interpolation of infrequent concentration measurements in timewith discharge as auxiliary variable, for example to estimate annualsediment or solute loads. A known limitation of rating curves is thattheir performance is generally poor, which can be partly attributed tothe fact that rating curve methods neglect the hysteresis effects in theconcentration response to changes in discharge. To enhance theperformance of rating curve models, they should account for thesehysteresis effects. Here, we present a supply-based concentrationrating curve for total phosphorus concentrations in the Rhine River, theNetherlands, which does account for the above hysteresis effects. Thesupply-based concentration rating curve has four components: 1) Thetraditional power law rating curve of the form C = a Qb where C is thephosphorus concentration [M L- 3], Qis the river discharge [L T- 1], and aand b are constants [-]; 2) A long-term linear trend; 3) Aseasonal trend of the form C(t) = Acos [2 π(t - Tk) /T] where A is theconcentration amplitude [M L- 3], t is the time (T), Tk is the phaseshift (T), and T is the period [T] (365. 25 d). 4) A dischargedependent supply or loss term of the form C = -ΔS/(QΔt),where S is the phosphorus stock [M]. The phosphorus stock was assumed toincrease linearly during periods of deposition, i. e. the discharge isbelow a <b>critical</b> <b>discharge.</b> If the discharge is greater than thecritical discharge during a sufficiently long period (> 16 days), thedecrease in phosphorus stock was assumed to be proportional to theexcess discharge above the <b>critical</b> <b>discharge.</b> For modelparameterization and calibration, we used the daily Aqualarm data oftotal phosphorus concentrations and the Waterbase data of waterdischarge measured daily by Rijkswaterstaat (Dutch Ministry ofInfrastructure and the Environment) at the Lobith-Bimmen monitoringstation at the German-Dutch border between 1 April 2004 and 20 July 2010. The model parameters were calibrated by a step-wise procedurewhich involved in some steps visual calibration (e. g. concentrationamplitude, <b>critical</b> <b>discharge</b> for erosion/deposition) and in other stepsregression analysis (e. g. long-term linear trend, power law ratingcurve). The total phosphorus concentrations show a long-term lineardecrease of 1. 0 - 10 - 5 mg l- 1 d- 1. The amplitude of the seasonalfluctuation in phosphorus concentration was estimated to be 0. 03 mg l- 1. The <b>critical</b> <b>discharge</b> for erosion and deposition was estimated to be 1900 m s- 1, the increase in phosphorus stock during deposition periods 9300 kg d- 1, and the supply from the phosphorus stock to the river water 32 kg d- 1 per m 3 s excess discharge. The squared Pearson's correlationcoefficient between the observed and predicted total phosphorusincreased from 0. 16 for the traditional power-law concentration ratingcurve (Nash's efficiency coefficient = 0. 13) to 0. 36 for thesupply-based rating curve (Nash's efficiency coefficient = 0. 34). Thisimplies that inclusion of the long-term and seasonal trends and adischarge dependent supply and loss term considerably enhances theperformance and predictive power of the concentration rating curvemodel. As the response to changes in discharge is different fordissolved and particulate total phosphorus, a further improvement ofmodel performance can likely be achieved by deriving separateconcentration rating curves for dissolved total phosphorus andsediment-associated phosphorus...|$|E

Its determination depends upon the subjective judgment of the investigator. Effects of this judgment on sediment transport and flow parameters have been investigated in this paper by considering three flow conditions of M (when small number of particles start to move), M 1 (when large number of particles starts to move), and M 2 (when very large number of particles starts to move). Data used in this paper were collected from a sediment transport study conducted in the hydraulics laboratory of the University of Manitoba (Canada). Effects of each flow condition on sediment transport, <b>critical</b> <b>discharge,</b> critical velocity, and flow depth parameters were investigated and a significant variation in results was found when flow conditions varied. This variation was more pronounced with the smaller sediment sizes as compared to the larger ones. For the <b>critical</b> <b>discharge,</b> a difference between M and M 1, M 1 and M 2 and M and M 2 conditions ranged from 36 - 118 %, 16 - 129 % and 61 - 211 %, respectively.

40|$|Models are {{proposed}} for channelized and distributed flow of meltwater {{at the base}} of an ice sheet. The volumes of both channel and distributed systems evolve according to a competition between processes that open drainage space (e. g. sliding over bedrock,melting of the ice) and processes that close it (e. g. viscous creep of the ice due to a positive effective pressure). Channels are generally predicted to have lower water pressure and therefore capture water from the surrounding regions of distributed flow. There is a natural length scale associated with the distributed system that determines the width of the bed from which water can be drawn into a channel. It is suggested that this determines the spacing between major channels and that this may be reflected in the spacing of eskers. A more permeable distributed system results in more widely spaced, and therefore larger, channels. Calculations of the flow into the head of a channel reveal that there is a <b>critical</b> <b>discharge</b> necessary for it to form, and provide a criterion for where channels can exist...|$|E
