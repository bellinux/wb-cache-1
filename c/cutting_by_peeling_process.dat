40|$|The <b>peeling</b> <b>process</b> is an {{algorithmic}} {{procedure that}} discovers a random planar map step by step. In generic {{cases such as}} the UIPT or the UIPQ, it is known [Curien & Le Gall, Scaling limits for the <b>peeling</b> <b>process</b> on random maps, Ann. Inst. Henri Poincaré Probab. Stat. 53, 1 (2017), 322 [...] 357] that any <b>peeling</b> <b>process</b> will eventually discover the whole map. In this paper we study {{the probability that the}} origin is not swallowed <b>by</b> the <b>peeling</b> <b>process</b> until time n and show it decays at least as n^- 2 c/ 3 where c ≈ 0. 12831235141783245423674486573872854933142662048339843 [...] . is defined via an integral equation derived using the Lamperti representation of the spectrally negative 3 / 2 -stable Lévy process conditioned to remain positive [Chaumont, Kyprianou & Pardo, Some explicit identities associated with positive self-similar Markov processes, Stochastic Process. Appl. 119, 3 (2009), 980 [...] 1000] which appears as a scaling limit for the perimeter process. As an application we sharpen the upper bound of the sub-diffusivity exponent for random walk of [Benjamini & Curien, Simple random walk on the uniform infinite planar quadrangulation: subdiffusivity via pioneer points, Geom. Funct. Anal. 23, 2 (2013), 501 [...] 531]. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} method to compute the {{generating}} function {{of the number of}} vertices inside certain regions of the Uniform Infinite Planar Triangulation (UIPT). The computations are mostly combinatorial in flavor and the main tool is the decomposition of the UIPT into layers, called the skeleton decomposition, introduced by Krikun [20]. In particular, we get explicit formulas for the generating functions of the number of vertices inside hulls (or completed metric balls) centered around the root, and the number of vertices inside geodesic slices of these hulls. We also recover known results about the scaling limit of the volume of hulls previously obtained by Curien and Le Gall <b>by</b> studying the <b>peeling</b> <b>process</b> of the UIPT in [17]...|$|R

This {{valuable}} substance is traditionally tapped <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> or <b>peeling</b> back the bark, or by making deep gashes {{at the base}} of the trunk with an axe. Such crude methods of extraction often kill the tree, but it has been found that application of the plant growth regulator ethephon stimulates the production of gum, and when used in carefully controlled amounts, increases gum yield and enhances healing of the wounds.|$|R
40|$|Finding {{the dense}} regions of a graph and {{relations}} {{among them is}} a fundamental task in network analysis. Nucleus decomposition is a principled framework of algorithms that generalizes the k-core and k-truss decompositions. It can leverage the higher-order structures to locate the dense subgraphs with hierarchical relations. Computation of the nucleus decomposition is performed in multiple steps, known as the <b>peeling</b> <b>process,</b> and it requires global information about the graph at any time. This prevents the scalable parallelization of the computation. Also, {{it is not possible}} to compute approximate and fast results <b>by</b> the <b>peeling</b> <b>process,</b> because it does not produce the densest regions until the algorithm is complete. In a previous work, Lu et al. proposed to iteratively compute the h-indices of vertex degrees to obtain the core numbers and prove that the convergence is obtained after a finite number of iterations. In this work, we generalize the iterative h-index computation for any nucleus decomposition and prove convergence bounds. We present a framework of local algorithms to obtain the exact and approximate nucleus decompositions. Our algorithms are pleasingly parallel and can provide approximations to explore time and quality trade-offs. Our shared-memory implementation verifies the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of our algorithms on real-world networks. In particular, using 24 threads, we obtain up to 4. 04 x and 7. 98 x speedups for k-truss and (3, 4) nucleus decompositions...|$|R

It is a valuable substance and is traditionally tapped <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> or <b>peeling</b> back the bark, or by making deep gashes {{at the base of the}} trunk with an axe. These crude methods of extraction often resulted in the death of the tree, but it has been found that application of the plant growth regulator ethephon stimulates the production of gum, and when used in carefully controlled amounts, increases gum yield and enhances healing of the wounds and survival of the tree.|$|R
40|$|Browning {{of fresh}} fruits and {{vegetables}} reduces quality and is often the factor limiting shelflife and marketability (Bolin and Huxoll, 1991; Couture et al., 1993). This is especially true when these horticultural commodities are wounded <b>by</b> <b>cutting,</b> <b>peeling,</b> or abrading the surface. Enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions with phenolic compounds produce brown pigments in plant tissue. Some tissues (e. g., artichokes) contain high levels of preformed phenolic compounds and rapidly brown in the air after wounding. Preventing browning in these tissues requires deactivation of the enzymes responsible for browning (e. g., polyphenoloxidase), exclusion of oxygen (e. g., oxygen levels below 1 %), or application of chemical antioxidants (e. g., ascorbi...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogenation is {{a process}} in which an added {{hydrogen}} atom bonds to another atom by sharing its only electron with this atom. Organic chemists use hydrogenation to convert unsaturated into saturated fats and to transfer alkenes into alkanes (1). On page 610 of this issue, Elias et al. (2) show that a similar process can also be realized in condensed matter physics. Incorporating hydrogen into graphene—a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal crystal lattice and the thinnest material conducting electricity—transforms it into graphane, a new material whose physical properties are very different from those of graphene. A graphene layer can be separated from a crystal of graphite <b>by</b> a <b>peeling</b> <b>process</b> while preserving its crystal structure and excellent electrical conduction (3). Furthermore, its electrical conduction can be tuned—similar to that of a field-effect transistor—by putting it on a substrate and varying the density of mobile particles (electrons and holes) by applying a voltage between the layer and substrate. The unique physical and electrical properties of graphene allow not only the experimental testing of fundamental principles of quantum physics but also the fabrication of new device...|$|R
40|$|The {{adhesion}} {{of cells}} to surfaces plays {{a crucial role}} in processes related to motility and tissue growth. Nonspecific interactions with a surface, e. g., by electrostatic or van der Waals forces, can complement specific molecular interactions and can themselves support strong adhesion. In order to understand the mechanism by which cells establish an adhesive interface in the absence of specific proteins, we have studied the detachment kinetics of monocytic cells from glass surfaces coated with poly-L-lysine. We exposed adhering cells to a shear flow and studied their deformation and detachment trajectories. Our experiments reveal that between 20 and 60 parallel membrane tethers form prior to detachment from the surface. We propose that the extraction of tethers is the consequence of an inhomogeneous adhesion interface and model the detachment mechanism as the dynamic extrusion of cooperatively loaded tethers. In our model, individual tethers detach <b>by</b> a <b>peeling</b> <b>process</b> in which a zone of a few nanometers is loaded by the externally applied force. Our findings suggest that the formation of an inhomogeneous non-specific adhesion interface between a cell and its substrate gives rise to more complex dynamics of detachment than previously discussed...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{mechanical}} <b>peeling</b> <b>process</b> {{using an}} abrasive-cutter brush which applies both abrasive and cutting forces was modeled. An energy consumption {{model of the}} <b>peeling</b> <b>process</b> is required to optimize the main influential factors {{as well as to}} limit peeling waste and consumed energy. The input and output variables which could be industrially applicable were used. Three variables, namely rotational velocity of the abrasive-cutter brush (xp), the degree of unevenness of produce surface (u), and the type of the abrasive-cutter brush (k), were chosen as independent variables and the "peeling losses" per unit time was selected as the output of the model. The developed model was verified using the experimental results of <b>peeling</b> <b>by</b> an abrasive-cutter brush for two varieties of pumpkin, as the case studies, named Jarrahdale and Jap. The results showed correlation coefficients between predicted and experimental values of the Jap (0. 98) and Jarrahdale (0. 96) were statistically significant...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThree-dimensional {{structures}} of proteins are {{the support of}} their biological functions. Their folds are maintained by inter-residue interactions which {{are one of the}} main focuses to understand the mechanisms of protein folding and stability. Furthermore, protein structures can be composed of single or multiple functional domains that can fold and function independently. Hence, dividing a protein into domains is useful for obtaining an accurate structure and function determination. In previous studies, we enlightened protein contact properties according to different definitions and developed a novel methodology named Protein Peeling. Within protein structures, Protein Peeling characterizes small successive compact units along the sequence called protein units (PUs). The <b>cutting</b> done <b>by</b> Protein <b>Peeling</b> maximizes the number of contacts within the PUs and minimizes the number of contacts between them. This method is so a relevant tool {{in the context of the}} protein folding research and particularly regarding the hierarchical model proposed by George Rose. Here, we accurately analyze the PUs at different levels of cutting, using a non-redundant protein databank. Distribution of PU sizes, number of PUs or their accessibility are screened to determine their common and different features. Moreover, we highlight the preferential amino acid interactions inside and between PUs. Our results show that PUs are clearly an intermediate level between secondary structures and protein structural domains...|$|R

A new experimental configuration has been developed to investigate the stability of the <b>peeling</b> <b>process</b> of elastic tapes. The experimental method allows for independent variation of the applied load and stiffness of the system. The role of various parameters including the stiffness of the loading system and geometry of the tape on the stability of peeling is investigated. The change in stiffness can be tuned to trigger or delay the onset of instability. Theoretical stability criteria are used to develop insights into the role of various experimentally varied parameters on the stability of the <b>peeling</b> <b>process...</b>|$|R

30|$|Our {{results are}} {{different}} from those of Podsiadlo et al. [26] who showed that LBL films containing polycations modified with l-DOPA groups, become more rigid after the reticulation of the l-DOPA groups in the presence of Fe 3 + cations. In the present case, where the (PAH-MMT)n films were modified with polydopamine after the deposition of the PEM film, it might well be that polydopamine which allows to establish crosslinks between amino groups carried by the polycation, induces a decrease of the strength of the interactions between the polycation and the clay. Another possible or complementary explanation for a slight decrease in the films elasticity is an overall increase in the fraction of organic material in the composite film as revealed by TGA (Fig.  4). The addition of polydopamine in the composite film may add some defects contributing to the decrease in the film’s modulus. Even if the average elastic modulus decreases after reaction with dopamine to form polydopamine, the PEM films become impermeable to redox probes like hexacyanoferrate (Fig.  5) and also display a better adhesion with the colloidal probe used to perform the AFM experiments. Namely, over 1  ×  1  μm surface areas, the adhesion force between the (PAH-MMT) 10 -@polydopamine film and the silica probe glued on the cantilever was of 49  ±  3  nN, whereas it was only of 38  ±  2  nN for the (PAH-MMT) 10 film. This finding is not unexpected owing to the well known behaviour of polydopamine films to be mimics of Mefp proteins in mussels [36]. In addition, whereas the (PAH-MMT) 60 films can be detached from the deposition substrate as a free standing membrane <b>by</b> a single <b>peeling</b> <b>process</b> [27], it seems that the adhesion of the polydopamine modified films with the glass substrate is significantly improved impeding its easy detachment. This finding opens the route for the fabrication of robust multilayer films with improved adhesion to their deposition substrate which is a prerequisite for many industrial applications.|$|R
