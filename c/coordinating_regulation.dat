40|$|Farnesoid X {{receptor}} (FXR) {{plays an}} important role in maintaining bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis. Here we demonstrate that FXR also regulates glucose metabolism. Activation of FXR by the synthetic agonist GW 4064 or hepatic overexpression of constitutively active FXR by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer significantly lowered blood glucose levels in both diabetic db/db and wild-type mice. Consistent with these data, FXR null mice exhibited glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity. We further demonstrate that activation of FXR in db/db mice repressed hepatic gluconeogenic genes and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis and glycogen content by a mechanism that involves enhanced insulin sensitivity. In view of its central roles in <b>coordinating</b> <b>regulation</b> of both glucose and lipid metabolism, we propose that FXR agonists are promising therapeutic agents for treatment of diabetes mellitus...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the incentives for independent domestic bank regulators to coor-dinate regulatory policies when the jurisdictions under their authority are financially integrated. Because of externalities in bank regulation, competition among regulators reduces regulatory standards {{relative to a}} centralized solution, making the independent solution inefficient. <b>Coordinating</b> <b>regulation,</b> however, entails a loss of independence if equal standards must be applied to all countries. Then, a central regulator {{is more likely to}} emerge among more homogeneous countries. In that context, a centralized regulator will be unanimously preferred to independence only if it sets regulatory stan-dards higher than those of the country with the highest individual standards. The existence of financial linkages between more than two jurisdictions may prevent the formation of partial regulatory unions, or, if they succeed in forming, may constitute an impediment for the formation of more comprehensive unions. Finally, increases in financial integration across countries have different effects on the incentives for the formation of regulatory unions depending on the form they take. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Salmonella PhoQ is a {{histidine}} kinase with a periplasmic sensor domain {{that promotes}} virulence by detecting the hostile {{environment of the}} host macrophage phagosome. PhoQ kinase activity is repressed by divalent cations and induced in environments of acidic pH, limited divalent cations, and cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMP). Upon activation, PhoQ phosphorylates the response regulator PhoP, <b>coordinating</b> <b>regulation</b> of greater than three hundred genes involved in virulence and intracellular survival. Previously, it was unclear which host signals are sensed by salmonellae to promote PhoPQ-mediated virulence. Using NMR and random activating mutagenesis, we defined conformational changes produced in the PhoQ periplasmic domain on exposure to acidic pH that indicate structural flexibility is induced in α-helices 4 and 5, suggesting this region contributes to sensing fluctuations in periplasmic pH. Therefore, we engineered a disulfide bond between the residues W 104 C and A 128 C in the PhoQ periplasmic domain that restrains conformational flexibility between the α-helices 4 and 5 and the α/β-core of the periplasmic domain. PhoQW 104 C-A 128 C is responsive to CAMP, but is inhibited for activation by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation. Salmonella enterica Typhimurium with the phoQW 104 C-A 128 C allele are virulent in mice and macrophages, indicating that acidic pH and divalent cation sensing by PhoQ are dispensable for virulence...|$|E

The Maastricht Treaty spells out precisely {{the role of the}} European Central Bank (ECB) and NCBs within the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) as to achieve the objective of price stability, but it is not equally clear as far as the objective of financial stability is concerned. In an area like EMU {{with a high degree of}} financial and economic integration, the actions undertaken by NCBs in the fields of regulation, prudential supervision and Lending of Last Resort are characterized by relevant externalities across jurisdictions. The present institutional design does not allow EMU to benefit from the internalization of these spillovers since NCBs do not face incentives to undertake properly banking policy activities. Applying the principle of subsidiarity to the problem of power sharing between ECB and NCBs, the following suggestions for a revision of the institutional design are obtained: i) ECB should be assigned the task of <b>coordinating</b> <b>regulation</b> activities to avoid regulatory arbitrage, while prudential supervision should be managed jointly in a two-tier system by ECB and NCBs; the decision process pertaining the use of discount window and the Lending of Last Resort function should be centralized; ii) the rules pertaining the working of TARGET and EMS 2 should be changed in order to limit the risk of a financial crises imported from pre-ins countries. ...|$|E

Two pea (Pisum sativum) P 450 cDNAs (CYP 73 A 9 v 1, encoding trans-cinnamic acid hydroxylase [t-CAH] in the core phenylpropanoid pathway, and CYP 82 A 1 v 1, possibly encoding an activity in a late branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway) have previously been described. Of three CYP 73 A 9 genes now isolated, the CYP 73 A 9 v 1 gene is full-length with two introns at positions conserved in other t-CAH genes, and the CYP 73 A 9 v 2 and CYP 73 A 9 v 3 gene fragments are 5 ′-truncated and lack introns. The full-length CYP 82 A 1 v 2 gene contains a single intron at an alternate position. Nucleotide searches of the CYP 73 A 9 v 1 and CYP 82 A 1 v 2 promoters have indicated that the regulatory sequences for these early and late phenylpropanoid transcripts are substantially different. The P-, L-, and H-boxes identified in white light-, ultraviolet light-, and elicitor-induced footprints in early phenylpropanoid promoters (phenylalanine ammonia lyase [PAL], 4 -coumarate coenzyme A:ligase [4 -CL], and chalcone synthase [CHS]) are conserved in the t-CAH promoter and are absent from the CYP 82 A 1 v 2 promoter.

40|$|Abstract Background Many of the {{functional}} units in cells are multi-protein complexes such as RNA polymerase, the ribosome, and the proteasome. For such units to work together, {{one might expect}} {{a high level of}} regulation to enable co-appearance or repression of sets of complexes at the required time. However, this type of <b>coordinated</b> <b>regulation</b> between whole complexes is difficult to detect by existing methods for analyzing mRNA co-expression. We propose a new methodology that is able to detect such higher order relationships. Results We detect <b>coordinated</b> <b>regulation</b> of multiple protein complexes using logic analysis of gene expression data. Specifically, we identify gene triplets composed of genes whose expression profiles are found to be related by various types of logic functions. In order to focus on complexes, we associate the members of a gene triplet with the distinct protein complexes to which they belong. In this way, we identify complexes related by specific kinds of regulatory relationships. For example, we may find that the transcription of complex C is increased only if the transcription of both complex A AND complex B is repressed. We identify hundreds of examples of <b>coordinated</b> <b>regulation</b> among complexes under various stress conditions. Many of these examples involve the ribosome. Some of our examples have been previously identified in the literature, while others are novel. One notable example is the relationship between the transcription of the ribosome, RNA polymerase and mannosyltransferase II, which is involved in N-linked glycan processing in the Golgi. Conclusions The analysis proposed here focuses on relationships among triplets of genes that are not evident when genes are examined in a pairwise fashion as in typical clustering methods. By grouping gene triplets, we are able to decipher <b>coordinated</b> <b>regulation</b> among sets of three complexes. Moreover, using all triplets that involve <b>coordinated</b> <b>regulation</b> with the ribosome, we derive a large network involving this essential cellular complex. In this network we find that all multi-protein complexes that belong to the same functional class are regulated {{in the same direction as}} a group (either induced or repressed) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background MicroRNA (miRNA) is a {{class of}} small RNAs of ~ 22 nt which play {{essential}} roles in many crucial biological processes and numerous human diseases at post-transcriptional level of gene expression. It has been revealed that miRNA genes tend to be clustered, and the miRNAs organized into one cluster are usually transcribed coordinately. This implies a <b>coordinated</b> <b>regulation</b> mode exerted by clustered miRNAs. However, how the clustered miRNAs <b>coordinate</b> their <b>regulations</b> on large scale gene expression is still unclear. Results We constructed the miRNA-transcription factor regulatory network that contains the interactions between transcription factors (TFs), miRNAs and non-TF protein-coding genes, and made a genome-wide study on the regulatory coordination of clustered miRNAs. We found {{that there are two}} types of miRNA clusters, i. e. homo-clusters that contain miRNAs of the same family and hetero-clusters that contain miRNAs of various families. In general, the homo-clustered as well as the hetero-clustered miRNAs both exhibit <b>coordinated</b> <b>regulation</b> since the miRNAs belonging to one cluster tend to be involved in the same network module, which performs a relatively isolated biological function. However, the homo-clustered miRNAs show a direct regulatory coordination that is realized by one-step regulation (i. e. the direct <b>regulation</b> of the <b>coordinated</b> targets), whereas the hetero-clustered miRNAs show an indirect regulatory coordination that is realized by a regulation comprising at least three steps (e. g. the <b>regulation</b> on the <b>coordinated</b> targets by a miRNA through a sequential action of two TFs). The direct and indirect regulation target different categories of genes, the former predominantly regulating genes involved in emergent responses, the latter targeting genes that imply long-term effects. Conclusion The genomic clustering of miRNAs is closely related to the <b>coordinated</b> <b>regulation</b> in the gene regulatory network. The pattern of regulatory coordination is dependent on the composition of the miRNA cluster. The homo-clustered miRNAs mainly <b>coordinate</b> their <b>regulation</b> rapidly, while the hetero-clustered miRNAs exert control with a delay. The diverse pattern of regulatory coordination suggests distinct roles of the homo-clustered and the hetero-clustered miRNAs in biological processes. </p...|$|R

In silico comparative {{analysis was used to}} predict transcriptional regulatory features in individual mammalian GABA A receptor subunit genes, and to identify potential transcriptional regulatory components involved in the <b>coordinate</b> <b>regulation</b> of the GABA A receptor gene clusters. Results Previously unreported putative promoters were identified for the β 2, γ 1, γ 3, ε, θ and π subunit genes. Putative core elements and proximal transcriptional factors were identified within these predicted promoters, and within the experimentally determined promoters of other subunit genes. Conserved intergenic regions of sequence in the mammalian GABA A receptor gene cluster comprising the α 1, β 2, γ 2 and α 6 subunits were identified as potential long range transcriptional regulatory components involved in the <b>coordinate</b> <b>regulation</b> of these genes. A region of predicted DNase I hypersensitive sites within the cluster may contain transcriptional regulatory features coordinating gene expression. A novel model is proposed for the coordinate control of the gene cluster and parallel expression of the α 1 and β 2 subunits, based upon the selective action of putative Scaffold/Matrix Attachment Regions (S/MARs). Conclusion The putative regulatory features identified by genomic analysis of GABA A receptor genes were substantiated by cross-species comparative analysis and now require experimental verification. The proposed model for the <b>coordinate</b> <b>regulation</b> of genes in the cluster accounts for the head-to-head orientation and parallel expression of the α 1 and β 2 subunit genes, and for the disruption of transcription caused by insertion of a neomycin gene in the close vicinity of the α 6 gene, which is proximal to a putative critical S/MAR. </p...|$|R
