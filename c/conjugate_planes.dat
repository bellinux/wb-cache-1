40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of second-order moments, a generalized canonical representation of a two-dimensional optical signal is proposed, which {{is associated with the}} angular Poincaré sphere. Vortex-free (or zero-twist) optical beams arise on the equator of this sphere, while beams with a maximum vorticity (or maximum twist) are located at the poles. An easy way is shown how the latitude on the sphere, which is a measure for the degree of vorticity, can be derived from the second-order moments. The latitude is invariant when the beam propagates through a first-order optical system between <b>conjugate</b> <b>planes.</b> To change the vorticity of a beam, a system that does not operate between <b>conjugate</b> <b>planes</b> is needed, with the gyrator as the prime representative of such a system.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the invariant line {{in the development of}} precipitation crystallography has received increasing recognition. Closed form expressions for the orientation relationship (OR) and the invariant line are available only from two-dimensional models, which cannot yield an invariant line inclined to the rotation axis. This paper presents a set of analytical expressions for the invariant line and the corresponding ORs in various conditions based on a systematic study using a three-dimensional model. If a pair of <b>conjugate</b> <b>planes</b> are parallel with different spacings, the invariant line must lie in these parallel planes. If a pair of conjugate Burgers vectors are parallel with different magnitudes, the interface will contain a set of dislocations alternating with O-lines which are usually inclined to the near-parallel <b>conjugate</b> <b>planes.</b> The distribution of atomic matching in selected interfaces containing the invariant line is also simulated.

40|$|A {{non-destructive}} imaging-based {{displacement measurement}} technique, Digital Image Correlation (DIC), {{was used to}} evaluate local displacements on surfaces of sand specimens throughout biaxial and triaxial tests. The DIC method yielded thousands of displacement data points across an imaged surface of a specimen, providing the opportunity for analysis of local, micro-level displacement mechanisms that trigger the onset of persistent shear bands. The displacement patterns evidenced both in biaxial and triaxial tests suggested clearly that shear banding naturally initiates along <b>conjugate</b> <b>planes.</b> However, when test boundary conditions did not constrain shear band growth, the formation of a single, persistent shear band was favored; otherwise, conjugate shear was sustained. Shear band formation commenced just before peak stress, near the edges of the specimen, where shear deformation was least constrained. Shear band formation was not instantaneous, but required a finite amount of shear translation to fully initiate. Displacement gradients across shear bands were decidedly parabolic, and displacement fields along the length of a shear band exhibited a notable, non-rotational periodicity, perhaps associated with “force chain ” buildup and collapse. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} variant of a {{traditional}} genetic algorithm, known as a niching genetic algorithm (NGA), which is effective at multimodal function optimi-zation. Such an algorithm is useful for geophysical inverse problems that contain more than one distinct solution. We illustrate the utility of an NGA via a multimodal seismological inverse problem: the inversion of teleseismic body waves for the source parameters of the Mw 7. 2 Kuril Islands event of 2 February 1996. We assume the source to be a pure double-couple event and so parametrize our models in terms of strike, dip, and slip, guaranteeing that two global minima exist, one of which rep-resents the fault plane and the other the auxiliary plane. We use ray theory to compute the fundamental P and SH synthetic seismograms for a given source-receiver ge-ometry; the synthetics for an arbitrary fault orientation are produced by taking linear combinations of these fundamentals, yielding a computationally fast forward prob-lem. The NGA is successful at determining that two major solutions exist and at maintaining the solutions in a steady state. Several inferior solutions representing local minima of the objective function are found as well.

40|$|We herein {{describe}} {{new methods}} for computing the quantitative parameters of earthquakes using macroseismic {{data and the}} uncertainties associated with these parameters. The methods allow for the location of epicenters that are offshore or that have no intensities assigned to any points in the epicentral region by maximizing the likelihood function of an attenuation equation with observed intensity data. In the most favorable cases, such an approach also allows the estimation of the source depth and the local attenuation coefficients. We compute the parameter uncertainties in two ways: (1) using formal methods, such as the inversion of the Hessian of the loglikelihood function at its maximum, and (2) by using bootstrap simulations. We tested the performance of our methods by comparison with reliable instrumental hypocenters of onshore earthquakes, and found a reasonable agreement with the epicentral locations (within 10 – 15 km for more than 70 % of cases) {{but not with the}} hypocentral depths, for which our results are generally underestimated by a factor of 2 or more and are poorly related to instrumental estimates. This finding indicates that the use of macroseismic depths in seismic hazard and seismotectonic investigations should be treated with caution. We nevertheless found good agreement (within 10 °– 15 °) between the fault-trace orientations that were computed using the macroseismic data and the associated focal mechanisms of earthquakes with Mw ≥ 5 : 7.

This thesis {{is an effort}} to address several issues in coherent beam combining. First, a mathematical formalism is developed to study cavity dependent properties, in particular, the modal response of complex laser systems. It is shown that the coherent beam combining in these common cavities is extremely sensitive to random path-length variations of the individual gain elements. Next, a number of methods are explored to reduce this sensitivity to length variations without actively controlling the path-lengths. This thesis introduces several coherent beam combining architectures based on Michelson cavity in which the spatial and longitudinal supermodes of the common cavity are manipulated to decrease the path-length sensitivity. A set of experiments is designed to verify the role of spatial and longitudinal supermodes. The measured dominant eigenmode, eigenvalue and output power are in good agreements with the predictions of the modal analysis. Finally, many applications prefer the output power to be concentrated in a small spot, whereas the supermodes of most complex cavities contain several lobes. This thesis describes a mode shaping technique, capable of converting any supermode to the desired distribution, with theoretically a 100 % efficiency. The technique employs two phase plates modifying the phases in Fourier <b>conjugate</b> <b>planes</b> to create a uniform beam (both in amplitude and phase), which directs all the power to the central lobe of the far-field.

For a given set of three indices of refraction n 1, n 2, and n 3, functional relationships among the y,j 7 diagram parameters that eliminate simultaneously other Seidel aberrations are derived. Expressions for zero coma, astigmatism, and Petzval curvature are also given. Criteria for selecting the non - optical parameter k, which defines the desired properties of modules, are described. A one -to-one correspondence between the canonical optical parameters defined in previous studies of modules and certain quantities derivable from the y,ÿ diagram representation is shown. Critical values of the free parameters of modules for both the real and the imaginary cases are derived and defined relative to the y,,y diagram parameters.
