40|$|<b>Conservation</b> by <b>Voltage</b> <b>Reduction</b> (CVR) is the {{implementation}} of a distribution voltage strategy whereby all distribution voltages are lowered to the minimum allowed by the equipment manufacturer. This strategy is rooted in the fact that many loads consume less power when they are fed with a voltage lower than nominal. Electric utility companies consider CVR as a potential solution for managing power in distribution networks. However, a difficult challenge is to keep end-of-line (EOL) voltages within an acceptable range of the ANSI Standard C 84. 1. Therefore, to achieve maximum benefit from CVR, electric utilities should be able to regulate residential voltages depending on load requirements. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a local solution which can regulate residential voltage levels from the first customer on the distribution feeder until the EOL of the distribution network. Such a solution will not only provide flexibility to electric utilities for better control over residential voltages but it can also maximize the benefits from CVR. The goal of this research is to develop a Residential Static Var Compensator (RSVC) that will allow electric utility companies to develop strategies for CVR and other applications. The proposed RSVC is in fact a reactive power compensator that can regulate a residential load voltage with a fixed capacitor in shunt with a reactor controlled by two bidirectional switches. The two switches are turned on and off in a complementary manner using a pulse-width modulation (PWM) technique that allows the reactor to function as a continuously-variable inductor. The proposed RSVC has several advantages compared to a conventional thyristor-based static var compensator (SVC), such as a quasi-sinusoidal inductor current, sub-cycle reactive power controllability, lower footprint for reactive components, and its realization as a single-phase device...|$|R

For the customer side, this dissertation discusses the planning and operation of a customer with multiple demand response programs, energy storage systems and distributed generators; for the utility side, this dissertation addresses the implementation and assessment of voltage/VAR control and <b>conservation</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>reduction</b> in a distribution grid with distributed generators. The objectives {{of this research}} are as follows: (1) to develop methods to assist customers to select appropriate demand response programs considering the integration of energy storage systems and DGs, and perform corresponding energy management including dispatches of loads, energy storage systems, and DGs; (2) to develop stochastic voltage/VAR control techniques for distribution grids with renewable DGs; (3) to develop optimization and validation methods for the planning of integration of renewable DGs to assist the implementation of voltage/VAR control; and (4) to develop techniques to assess load-reduction effects of voltage/VAR control and <b>conservation</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>reduction.</b> In this dissertation, a two-stage co-optimization method for the planning and energy management of a customer with demand response programs is proposed. The first level is to optimally select suitable demand response programs to join and integrate batteries, and the second level is to schedule the dispatches of loads, batteries and fossil-fired backup generators. The proposed method considers various demand response programs, demand scenarios and customer types. It can provide guidance to a customer to make the most beneficial decisions in an electricity market with multiple demand response programs. For the implementation of voltage/VAR control, this dissertation proposes a stochastic rolling horizon optimization-based method to conduct optimal dispatches of voltage/VAR control devices such as on-load tap changers and capacitor banks. The uncertainties of renewable DG output are taken into account by the stochastic formulation and the generated scenarios. The exponential load models are applied to capture the load behaviors of various types of customers. A new method to simultaneously consider the integration of DGs and the implementation of voltage/VAR control is also developed. The proposed method includes both solution and validation stages. The planning problem is formulated as a bi-level stochastic program. The solution stage is based on sample average approximation (SAA), and the validation stage is based on multiple replication procedure (MRP) to test the robustness of the sample average approximation solutions of the stochastic program.

A {{phenomenon known as}} load diversity {{plays a role in}} <b>voltage</b> <b>reduction</b> and can counteract its effects on occasion. The concept of load diversity can most easily be explained with an example. In your neighborhood, it is unlikely that all of the homes' water heaters are on at the same time. Particularly during non-hot water usage hours (morning and evening showers), when your hot water heater is on, your neighbor's may be off. Due to the distributed and noncoincident nature of these loads, the aggregate peak can remain relatively constant. However, if the voltage is reduced to all of the resistive elements in the water heaters, the elements {{will not be able to}} heat the water as quickly. While an immediate reduction in the power demand will be recognized upon initiating <b>voltage</b> <b>reduction,</b> over time water heaters will need to be on longer to achieve the thermostat-set water temperature. Thus, more water heaters will be on at the same time. This will cause the aggregate peak to increase substantially. Therefore, with respect to thermostat controlled resistive loads the benefits of <b>voltage</b> <b>reduction</b> can be short lived, and may occasionally end up increasing the aggregate load demand.|$|R
