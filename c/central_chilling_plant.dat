40|$|A robust fault {{diagnosis}} and validation strategy for temperature sensors and flow meters in <b>central</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>plant</b> is developed, {{which is based}} on the first law of thermodynamics. The strategy evaluates soft sensor faults (biases) by examining and minimizing the sum of the squares of concerned mass or steady state energy balance residuals represented by the corrected measurement over a period. It considers systematically all the concerned energy balances and obtains the best estimates of the sensor biases by minimizing the sum of the mean squares of normalized residuals of all energy balances involved. The genetic algorithm technique is employed to determine the global minimal solution to the multimodal objective function, which can be difficult to achieve by traditional gradient-directed search methods. Performance of an advanced robust fault detection, diagnosis and evaluation (FDD&E) scheme is compared with that of a sequential scheme, which was reported earlier, in simulation tests. The robust scheme is superior to the sequential scheme in robustness to abrupt sensor faults, such as biases, etc. The robust scheme is applied to a <b>central</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>plant</b> in an existing commercial building, providing satisfied bias estimates. As a basic method, the sensor FDD&E strategy is of practical value in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems as well as in systems where the measurements of liquid flow variables are essential to control and performance monitoring.

Healthy sensor measurements of them are essential for proper chiller sequencing control. Site experience indicates that these measurements are easily corrupted by systematic errors or measurement faults. Therefore, an online sensor fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) strategy based on data fusion technology is developed to detect faults in the building cooling load direct measurement. The confidence degree, generated by a data fusion algorithm, is used to indicate {{the existence of the}} faults. The faults in the chilled water flow rate and supply temperature measurements are diagnosed according to the redundant information provided in building automation system (BAS). The faults in the return water temperature measurements are diagnosed by reconstructing the confidence degree using the expected values of the chilled water flow rate and the supply temperature by taking account of the associated uncertainties.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-based supervisory and optimal control strategy for <b>central</b> <b>chiller</b> <b>plants</b> {{to enhance their}} energy efficiency and control performance. The optimal strategy is formulated using simplified models of major components and the genetic algorithm (GA). The simplified models are used as the performance predictors to estimate the system energy performance and response to the changes of control settings and working conditions. Since {{the accuracy of the}} models has significant impacts on the overall prediction results, the models used are linear in the parameters and the recursive least squares (RLS) estimation technique with exponential forgetting is used to identify and update the model parameters online. That is to ensure that the linear models can provide reliable and accurate estimates when working condition changes. The GA, as a global optimization tool, is used to solve the optimization problem and search for globally optimal control settings.

For {{many people in the}} industry, the thermal performance of cooling towers is often taken for granted. With proper control of condenser water temperature from the cooling tower, up to a 27 % increase in efficiency of a <b>central</b> <b>chilled</b> water <b>plant</b> can be realized. The condenser water system for a <b>chilled</b> water <b>plant</b> usually consists of three major components: water chillers, cooling towers and circulating water pumps.

These machines are the <b>central</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>plants</b> and the supply for cotnfort cooling for many large commercial buildings. Virtually all absorption chillers use lithium bromide (LiBr) and water as the absorption fluids. Water is the refrigerant. Research has shown LiBr to he {{one of the}} best absorption working fluids because it has a high affinity for water, releases water vapor at relatively low temperatures, and has a boiling point much higher than that of water. The heart of the chiller is the absorber, where a process of simultaneous heat and mass transfer occurs as the refrigerant water vapor is absorbed into a falling film of aqueous LiBr. The more water vapor absorbed into the falling film, the larger the chiller�s capacity for supporting comfort cooling. Improving the performance of the absorber leads directly to efficiency gains for the chiller. The design of an absorber is very empirical and requires experimental data. Yet design data and correlations are sparse in the open literature. The experimental data available to date have been derived at LiBr concentrations ranging from 0. 30 to 0. 60 mass fraction.

40|$|In a {{conventional}} central plant design, {{it is common}} to maintain a one-to-one correspondence between the pumps and the individual primary users such as the central plant chillers, the cooling towers, and the boilers. Generally, an additional pump is installed as a backup. However, sometimes problems arise when conventional pump system design and control methods are utilized. Many systems have high capital costs, and high operation and maintenance costs. Other issues include motor overload from mismatch of the single pump performance and the system performance when more than one pump is designed. Finally, energy costs are still high due to issues caused by the conventional control logic for pump activation and deactivation even with the application of variable frequency drives. ^ This research proposes an innovative pump system configuration as a solution to the previously stated problems. The new pump system is configured to support a minimal number of pumps.

The model was developed using a transient systems simulation program (TRNSYS) that includes plant performance and manufacturer data for the primary system components, which are comprised of pumps, chillers, cooling towers, and a thermal energy storage tank. The model is calibrated to the actual measured performance of the plant using the current control strategy as a baseline. By observing and quantifying areas for potential improvement in plant performance under conditions of high campus cooling load demands, alternative control strategies for the plant are proposed. Operation of the plant under each of these control strategies is simulated in the model and evaluated for overall energy and demand-usage cost savings. These results are used to recommend improvements in the plant’s current control strategy, {{as well as to}} propose an optimal control strategy that may be applied to reduce plant operating costs. The results of the model identify that the plant can perform more economically by employing more chiller power to charge the Thermal Energy Storage tank to higher capacities during overnight periods when the utility rates are lower. Staging the operation of the different chillers to more precisely follow the tank charges during these off-peak periods can ensure faster tank charging when its capacity may not be sufficient to meet the peak and part-peak cooling load demands.

This dissertation describes research efforts on optimal control for the simultaneous use of active and passive building thermal storage inventory. Model-based predictive optimal control, model-free learning control, and a hybrid learning but model-based control scheme were investigated successively. Numerical analysis and experimental study demonstrated {{that each of these}} approaches has advantages and disadvantages in terms of feasibility, robustness, and control performance. While model-based predictive optimal control offers the best control quality from the perspective of cost savings compared with conventional control strategies, it requires an accurate building model and accurate weather prediction, which is hard to achieve when the building is complex. Model-free learning control avoids the need for a physical model and forecasting by using a statistical summary of past operational experience. However, the training period is too long to be practical for commercial building applications, and the performance of the pure learning controller is sensitive to the selection of learning parameters. Finally, a hybrid learning control approach was investigated, which is based on simulated reinforcement learning and combines the merits of model-based and pure learning control. An experimental study confirmed the feasibility of the proposed hybrid learning control approach. Although operating cost savings were achieved compared with conventional control methodologies, they were lower than those for model-based predictive optimal control. The hybrid learning controller was significantly affected by the quality of the training model used to implant prior domain knowledge, and extensive real-time learning was required for the learning controller to eliminate false cues it received during the initial training period. Nevertheless, compared with pure reinforcement learning, the hybrid controller can be much more readily applied to a commercial building for implementation of supervisory adaptive optimal control. ...|$|R

40|$|Cooling equipment, whether used to meet {{air-conditioning}} {{or process}} cooling loads, represents a large consumer of energy. Even {{more to the}} point, cooling loads and the associated cooling equipment energy consumption tend to be at maximum levels during periods of high ambient air temperatures. It is precisely at those times that the general demand for energy is at its peak and therefore the price or value of energy is also at its highest level. Cooling loads often drive the peak electric power demand of energy users and thus affect not only the level of consumption of high cost energy, but also affect the peak power demand. Together, the energy and demand costs equate to very high unit costs for operating cooling equipment. Accordingly, it is of interest to minimize cooling energy use and costs by maximizing the energy efficiency of cooling equipment installations. A relatively new approach has been developed and is being increasingly used to maximize <b>chiller</b> <b>plant</b> efficiency. The approach {{involves the use of}} a standardized, pre-engineered, shop-fabricated approach to entire <b>chiller</b> <b>plant</b> installations. Compared to the traditional, piece-meal approach to <b>chiller</b> <b>plants</b> that utilize individual component specification, procurement and installation, the "packaged" or modular <b>chiller</b> <b>plant</b> approach often delivers substantially improved energy efficiencies. Also, the packaged plant approach achieves further benefits for large cooling system owners and operators.
