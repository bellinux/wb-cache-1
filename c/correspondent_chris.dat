2500|$|For a {{half century}} leading up to World War I, the Armenian populations of Anatolia became {{increasingly}} politically active, and in turn endured increasingly more brutal persecution under Sultan Abdul Hamid II. As the Ottoman Empire declined, its political leadership either authorized or tolerated increasingly violent and reckless attacks on the Armenian population, attracting harsh criticism from various Western nations whose missionary communities in Anatolia witnessed several wide scale massacres of Armenians. From 1894 to 1896 the Sultan ordered the deaths of up to 300,000 Armenians, resulting in at least 50,000 Armenian orphans, in the Hamidian massacres, which were later described by BBC <b>correspondent</b> <b>Chris</b> Morris in The New Turkey (Granta Books, 2005) as [...] "a portent of the grim events of 1915".|$|E

50|$|Way Too Early was an American {{morning news}} show which aired weekday mornings on MSNBC. It premiered on July 27, 2009 hosted by Willie Geist.

The final host was Chief White House <b>Correspondent</b> <b>Chris</b> Jansing. It ended August 5, 2016, as its lead-in program First Look was expanded back into the full hour and re-branded as Morning Joe First Look to build continuity with the later program, and presumably because the timeslot is now nearly universally programmed as a morning news slot on local television stations in both the Eastern and Central Time Zones, making the title Way Too Early an artifact.|$|E

5000|$|Azerbaijan and Turkey have {{subsequently}} {{built upon}} their linguistic and cultural ties {{to form a}} very close economic partnership that sees Turkey negotiating to buy natural gas from Azerbaijan and the two co-operating, along with neighbouring Georgia, in such infrastructure projects as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, the South Caucasus Pipeline, Kars-Tbilisi-Baku railway and the proposed Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline all of which bypassing Armenia despite a recent thawing in diplomatic relations between Ankara and Yerevan, which make them key players in European energy security.
