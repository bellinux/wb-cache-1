40|$|Background. A rubella mass {{vaccination}} campaign targeting 15 – 29 -year-old women {{was performed in}} Brazil in 2001 – 2002. Rubella vaccination was contraindicated during pregnancy. A follow-up protocol was implemented for pregnant women who were vaccinated {{as well as their}} newborns. The risks of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>infection</b> (<b>CRI)</b> after vaccination were assessed according to the pregnant women’s immune status. Methods. This was a prospective, noncontrolled study of pregnancy outcomes in women vaccinated against rubella in the state of Rio de Janeiro, including clinical and laboratory evaluations. Results. Of 2292 reported pregnant women who were vaccinated, 1636 had known outcomes: there were 1577 newborns (96. 4 %), 52 miscarriages (3. 2 %), and 7 stillbirths (0. 4 %). Gestational age at vaccination was# 5 weeks in 75 % of the susceptible, vaccinated pregnant women. Nine newborns were positive for immunoglobulin M; 4 were born to susceptible pregnant women, for a 2. 0 % CRI rate (95 % confidence interval,. 5 %– 4. 9 %); 4 were born to vaccinated pregnant women with indeterminate or unknown status; and 1 had CRS, with a wild-type virus infection. Conclusions. The absence of vaccine-related CRS cases further supports recommendations to not interrupt a pregnancy exposed to rubella vaccine virus. Monitoring pregnancy outcomes and CRI with vaccine virus can distinguish between wild-type and vaccine virus infections, especially in situations of viral circulation...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{susceptibility to}} and {{factors associated with}} rubella infection among pregnant mothers and to estimate the burden of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>infection</b> (<b>CRI)</b> in Vietnam where rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) {{is not included in}} the routine immunization program, we conducted a prospective cohort study in Nha Trang, Vietnam between 2009 and 2010. Rubella-specific immunoglobulin-M and immunoglobulin-G were investigated in cord blood samples by enzyme immunoassay. Corresponding clinical-epidemiological data were analyzed and the national congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) incidence was estimated using modeling. We enrolled 1988 pairs of mothers aged 17 - 45 years and their newborn babies. No mothers had received RCV. Multivariate analysis revealed that mothers aged 17 - 24 (aOR 2. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 7 - 3. 8) or 25 - 34 (1. 4, 1. 0 - 2. 1) years {{were more likely to be}} susceptible than those aged 35 - 45 years. Overall 28. 9 % (574 / 1988, 95 % CI: 26. 9 - 30. 9 %) of mothers were seronegative. The CRI rate was 151 (95 % CI: 0 - 322) per 100, 000 live births. Modeling estimated that 3788 babies (95 % CI: 3283 - 4143) were born with CRS annually in Vietnam with an overall CRS incidence of 234 (95 % CI: 207 - 262) cases per 100, 000 live births. A substantial proportion of women of childbearing age (WCBA) are at risk of rubella infection during pregnancy and this can result in a high frequency of miscarriage or burden of CRS across Vietnam. Prompt introduction of RCV into national immunization program with catch-up vaccination to children and WCBA will reduce CRI in Vietnam. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 654 号 学位授与年月日:平成 26 年 3 月 20 日Author: Masami Miyakawa, Hiroshi Yoshino, Lay Myint Yoshida, Emilia Vynnycky, Hideki Motomura, Le Huu Tho, Vu Dinh Thiem, Koya Ariyoshi, Dang Duc Anh, Hiroyuki MoriuchiCitation: Vaccine, 32 (10), pp. 1192 - 1198; 201...|$|E
40|$|Rubella is {{an acute}} {{infectious}} disease that normally has a mild clinical course. However, infections during pregnancy, especially before week 12 of gestation (WG), can cause severe birth defects known as <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> syndrome (CRS). The {{aim of this}} study was to perform genotyping and molecular characterization of rubella viruses involved in congenital infections in France over the past 15 years (1995 to 2009). Amniotic fluid (AF) specimens (n = 80) from pregnant women with <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>infections</b> (<b>CRI)</b> before week 20 of gestation, and a few other samples available from children/newborns with CRS (n = 26), were analyzed. The coding region of the rubella virus E 1 gene was amplified directly from clinical specimens by reverse transcriptase PCR, and the resulting DNA fragments were sequenced. Sequences were assigned to genotypes by phylogenetic analysis with rubella virus reference sequences. Sufficient E 1 gene sequences were obtained from 56 cases. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences showed that at least five different genotypes (1 E, 1 G, 1 B, 2 B, and 1 h) were present in France and were involved in congenital infections, with a strong predominance of genotype 1 E (87 %). This is one of the very few comprehensive studies of rubella viruses involved in CRI. The results indicated that over the past 15 years, multiple introductions of the dominant genotype E caused most of the CRI cases in France. A few sporadic cases were due to other genotypes (1 B, 1 G, 1 h, 2 B) ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: According to {{a report}} from WHO, cases of <b>rubella</b> <b>infection</b> in Indonesia has {{increased}} up to 10 -fold from 2007 to 2011. Despite no data of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> syndrome in the report, there are approximately 45, 000 cases of babies born with heart failure and 0. 1 - 0. 3 % live births with congenital deafness in Indonesia. Allegedly, <b>rubella</b> <b>infection</b> during pregnancy {{may play a role}} in this condition. This study aimed to optimize and validate a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method to detect rubella virus RNA as an aid for the diagnosis of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>infection.</b> METHODS: Method optimization was conducted using nucleic acids extracted from Trimovax Merieux vaccine with the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit. One step RT-qPCR was performed with Quantifast Multiplex RTPCR+R Kit. Target synthetic DNA was designed and used to determine the sensitivity of the method. RNA internal control was synthesized to control the process of extraction and amplification. RESULTS: The analytical sensitivity of this method was as low as 5 copies target synthetic DNA/μl. The mean Coefficient of Variation (CV) % of the critical threshold (Ct) obtained were 2. 71 %, 1. 20 %, 1. 62 %, and 1. 59 % for within run, between run, between kit lots, and between operators, respectively. Recovery of the target synthetic DNA from amniotic fluid was 100. 51 % (by the log copies/μl) at the concentration of 1, 000, 000 copies/μl. CONCLUSIONS: RT-qPCR is successfully used for the detection of rubella virus RNA in vaccine and synthetic nucleic acid.

To evaluate the effects of rubella vaccination during pregnancy, the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo conducted a follow-up study of pregnant women vaccinated during a rubella campaign in 2001. Methods. Women vaccinated during pregnancy were reported to a national surveillance system. In the state of Sao Paulo, follow-up of vaccinated women included household interviews. Serum samples from vaccinated women were tested for antirubella antibodies to classify susceptibility to <b>rubella</b> <b>infection.</b> Children born to susceptible mothers were tested for evidence of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>infection</b> and evaluated for signs of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> syndrome. Results. The Sao Paulo State Health Department received 6473 notifications of women vaccinated during pregnancy. Serology performed for 5580 women identified 811 (15 %) that were previously susceptible. Incidence of spontaneous abortion or stillbirth among previously susceptible vaccinated women was similar to women with prior immunity.

The mother gave birth to an icteric, microcephalic, dysmature neonate with hepatosplenomegaly and exanthema with multiple, small purple-red spots. Ultrasound cardiography revealed a persistently open arterial duct and a small defect of the ventricular septum. Radiological evaluation of the long bones showed the characteristic longitudinal lucent strands ('celery stalk appearance'). Ultrasound of the cerebrum showed diffuse widespread calcifications in the white matter and basal ganglia, striatal vasculopathy and diffuse parenchymal disorders. Psychomotor development was impaired. The patient was completely deaf in the left ear and had severely poor hearing in the right ear.

Follow up has so far been completed for seven of these cases, and they are described in this report. The other two cases are still being evaluated. These cases reveal that rubella during pregnancy and <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>infection</b> do occur in Italy. Only one case of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> was identified, indicating an incidence of CR well below the elimination threshold of less than 1 case per 100 000 live births, which in Italy would be equivalent to 5 CR cases. These data, however, probably represent marked underreporting. All cases were notified by the same hospital centre in Rome, and so we assume that many more unreported cases occur across Italy. This indicates a need for improved training of physicians regarding the necessity of reporting cases of suspected rubella in pregnancy and of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella...</b>|$|R

When the children were assessed between 8 months and 4 years 8 months of age a blood sample was also taken and tested for rubella antibodies so that a retrospective diagnosis of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>infection</b> could be made. Only 19 % of children exposed to subclinical maternal rubella showed evidence of intrauterine infection compared with 53 % of those born to mothers who had clinical rubella.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study on the}} {{prevalence}} of rubella-specific antibody among young adult females aged 14 - 25 years old in four cities and one district town in Ethiopia are presented. The highest prevalence of rubella antibody (97 %) was found among young females in Addis Ababa in the central region of the country, followed by those in Dessie, in the north of Ethiopia, and in Awassa in the south, both of which exhibited 94 % prevalence. The next highest prevalences were observed in Dire Dawa (88 %), a large town in the Hararge region, and in Gambella (85 %), a town in the remote western part of the country. The overall prevalence of the antibody was found to be 94 %. The remaining 6 % of the young adult female population are potentially susceptible to <b>rubella</b> virus <b>infection.</b> It follows that the incidence of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>infection</b> is probably low in Ethiopia because {{the vast majority of the}} female population is immune...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>infection</b> can be {{prevented}} by protecting women of reproductive age through vaccination. The aims {{of this study were}} to estimate the seroprevalence of rubella virus antibodies among females aged between 15 and 45 years in the province of Frosinone and to assess knowledge about <b>Rubella</b> and <b>Congenital</b> <b>Rubella</b> Syndrome (CRS) and the association between rubella immunization status and various risk factors. Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out involving 1242 females recruited by random selection. Enzyme immunoassay method was used to detect and quantify human anti IgG antibodies for rubella virus in 1242 anonymously females aged between 15 and 45 years. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic data including age, sex, previous history, previous vaccination and knowledge about rubella. Statistical analysis was carried out using the program EpiInfo 3. 3. Results: The majority of the females recruited to the study were 15 - 24 years old (66 %), unmarried (71. 2 %), students (61 %) who had not previously given birth (87. 9 %). Rubella Seroprevalence was 90. 3 % in women aged 40 - 45 years old and 68. 8 % in those aged 15 - 19 (p= 0. 0001). Only 137 participants reported having received rubella vaccination. Generally knowledge about <b>rubella</b> and <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> syndrome was lacking. Conclusions: In the province of Frosinone, women in each age group were in need of active immunization. Furthermore, the susceptibility rates for rubella are far from the value of national serosurveys for similar age groups (8 %) and even further from the target set by the National Plan for Measles and <b>Congenital</b> <b>Rubella</b> Elimination launched in 2003. For females of reproductive age, immunization is an effective but underutilized method of CRS prevention and although rubella vaccine is free charge for these women and pre-conception screening is available, these opportunities remain substantially underutilised...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Rubella is {{a disease}} caused by the rubella virus and is usually mild and self-limiting. Infection of a {{developing}} fetus is serious and important because the child may be born with <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> syndrome. Its symptoms include mental retardation, heart defects, cataract, etc. In 2003, mass vaccination against measles and rubella in individuals 5 - 25 years old was done. One of the main objectives {{of this study was}} to survey <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>infection</b> status with the presence of IgM antibodies against rubella virus in cord blood samples and also the immunity assessment of maternal IgG antibodies against rubella virus in the samples. Materials & Methods: In this cross-sectional study 358 cord blood samples were collected in hospitals affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences in 2008 - 2009. The collected samples were analyzed by two ELISA methods for detection of IgG and IgM antibodies and RT-nested PCR tests on samples of IgG–negative and IgM-positive. In this study two groups of mothers were tested, one consisted of the ones 29 with the frequency of 29. 1 %. Results: The mean age of subjects was 22. 6 years old. Out of 358 samples, 326 (91. 1 %) were IgG positive, and 10 (2. 8 %) were IgM positive against rubella virus. All of the samples with negative result for IgG antibody, and positive result for IgM antibody against rubella virus were tested for the presence of rubella genome with RT-nested PCR method. None of these samples were positive according to the presence of the virus genome. Conclusion: According to the high immunity of mothers, the probability of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> transmission is low, but because of low immunity of mothers being > 29 years old, it is highly reccommended to upgrade the age of vaccination to 28.

40|$|Background. Rubella during {{pregnancy}} can cause serious fetal abnormalities and death. Peru has had integrated measles/rubella surveillance since 2000 {{but did not}} implement <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> syndrome (CRS) surveillance until 2004, {{in accordance with the}} Pan American Health Organization recommendations for rubella elimination. The article describes the experience from the CRS sentinel surveillance system in Peru. Methods. Peru has maintained a national sentinel surveillance system for reporting confirmed and suspected CRS cases since 2004. A surveillance protocol was implemented with standardized case definitions and instruments in the selected sentinel sites. Each sentinel site completes their case investigations and report forms and sends the reports to the Health Region Epidemiology Department, which forwards the data to the national Epidemiology Department. CRS surveillance data were analyzed for the period 2004 – 2007. Results. During the period 2004 – 2007, 16 health facilities, which are located in 9 of the 33 health regions, representing the 3 main geographical areas (coast, mountain, and jungle), were included as sentinel sites for the CRS surveillance. A total of 2061 suspected CRS cases were reported to the system. Of these, 11 were classified as CRS and 23 as <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>infection.</b> Factors significantly associated with rubella vertical transmission were: (1) in the mother, maternal history of rash {{during pregnancy}} (odds ratio [OR], 12. 0; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 8 – 37. 8); (2) and in the infant, pigmentary retinopathy (OR, 18. 4; 95 % CI, 3. 2 – 104. 6), purpura (OR, 14. 7; 95 % CI, 2. 8 – 78. 3) ...|$|R
