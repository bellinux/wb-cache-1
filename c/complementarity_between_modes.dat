40|$|This article aims {{to assess}} {{barriers}} to service {{provision in the}} banking and telecom sectors of four Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries, {{and the impact of}} these barriers on firm performance. Our methodology involves the computation of aggregate and modal trade restrictiveness indices (TRIs) by sector, and utilisation of these TRIs as regressors of firms' economic performance. Our analysis shows that significant regulatory reforms have taken place in the service sectors over the last decade in the MENA region, but that a broad range of restrictions still remain. The most significant change in these service sectors has been the lifting or softening of constraints on foreign equity participation. These regulatory reforms, however, have had varying degrees of impact on market structure depending on the country, the sector and the mode. Moreover, service restrictions have had an impact on economic performance in the three studied sectors. While a rent-creating effect seems to dominate restrictions on banking and fixed telecom sectors, a cost-inefficiency effect seems to dominate the mobile telecom sector. Finally, we find evidence of interactions between modal restrictions for banking services. Our results suggest a <b>complementarity</b> <b>between</b> <b>Modes</b> 3 and 1, as well as a substitution effect between Modes 3 and 4 in the banking sector...|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} {{a model of}} offshoring with externalities and firm heterogeneity. Due {{to the presence of}} externalities, temporary shocks like the Y 2 K problem can have permanent effects, i. e., they can permanently raise the extent of offshoring in an industry. Also, the initial advantage of a country as a potential host for outsourcing activities can create a lock in effect, whereby late movers have a comparative disadvantage. Furthermore, the existence of firm heterogeneity along with externalities can help explain the dynamic process of offshoring, where the most productive firms offshore first and the others follow later. Finally, we show the possibility of <b>complementarity</b> <b>between</b> two <b>modes</b> of offshoring: FDI and offshore outsourcing. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{summarizes the}} main findings of "Regulation" theory about {{the evolution of}} the Japanese economy since WWII and proposes an institutional interpretation of the crisis of the 90 s. The company-ist compromise is the core of the whole institutional architecture via an original wage labour nexus, largely different from the American Fordist one. There is a clear hierarchy between the large corportation and sub-contractors. One observers a <b>complementarity</b> <b>between</b> the <b>mode</b> of governance of the firm and the main bank and finallybetween the industrial wselfare and the management of employment. A highly original "regulation" mode has allowed the implementation of a mass production and consumption economy, but this regime enters into crisis by its very success and this crisis is exacerbated by the impact of the financial bubble of the 90 s. The paper surveys the transformation of the main institutional firms since the 90 s and builds three scenarios based respectively upon: a large inertia of Japanese economic and political institutions; a quick adoption of typical market-led institutions under the pressure of financial market; or a new hybridization process that would concern banking and finance and not only the manufacturing industries, as was the case after WWII. ...|$|R

This includes discussion of multisector linkages to the service sector, as well both measuring barriers to trade and investment (generally {{with a mix of}} firm surveys, price comparisons and econometrics), and how changes in these barriers, however measured, have been implemented in the CGE literature. Three challenges are highlighted: (i) identification of how trade in services takes place and how market access is therefore affected by policy; (ii) to find data sufficiently robust for modeling purposes; and (iii) linked to the data problem, quantify the barriers to be examined. Significant {{progress has been made in}} modeling foreign direct investment and linking this to productivity, which turns out to be important. We also provide an example of modeling productivity linkages to openness and domestic regulation, with an applied CGE model of Italy. This illustrates cross-sector linkages and the integration of economic data and policy measures to define service sector experiments. Priorities for future research include better modeling of market structure, the linkages between sectors and the <b>complementarities</b> <b>between</b> different <b>modes</b> of supplying services...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{investigate}} the relationship between cross border trade in services (Mode 1) and commercial presence in services (Mode 3). I postulate that these two modes of supply facilitate each other, and that, in contrast to the manufacturing sector, this complementarity might occur even at the level of horizontal investment. For the empirical analysis I make use of bilateral data on US majority-owned foreign affiliate operations (MOFAs). The same exercise is carried for the case of goods sectors. After using two different estimating techniques, results confirm the intuition, not only Mode 1 and Mode 3 in services are complements but also the complementarity relationship is stronger than that found in the case of goods. Moreover, the <b>complementarity</b> <b>between</b> this two <b>modes</b> of supply, for the case of services, is also found at the level of horizontal FDI. international trade in services; modes of supply; FDI...|$|R

Using clickstream data on a panel of more than 16, 000 European consumers, we estimate the eects of illegal downloading and legal streaming on the legal purchases of digital music. Our results suggest that Internet users do not view illegal downloading as a substitute to legal digital music. Although positive and signicant, our estimated elasticities are essentially zero: a 10 % increase in clicks on illegal downloading websites leads to a 0. 2 % increase in clicks on legal purchases websites. Online music streaming services are found to have a somewhat larger (but still small) eect on the purchases of digital sound recordings, suggesting <b>complementarities</b> <b>between</b> these two <b>modes</b> of music consumption. According to our results, a 10 % increase in clicks on legal streaming websites lead to up to a 0. 7 % increase in clicks on legal digital purchases websites.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{functionality}} {{of the private}} and public enforcement of directors' duties in the Australian context, as well as providing a first approximation of the empirical incidence of the formal enforcement of these laws. The theoretical literature suggests a possible <b>complementarity</b> <b>between</b> the <b>mode</b> of enforcement and the degree of dispersion of share ownership. That is, coordination costs may be expected to affect the likelihood of private enforcement by shareholders, whereas public enforcement is not subject to collective action problems. To shed light on these claims, this paper presents a new hand-collected database of 145 Australian cases involving alleged breaches of directors' duties. The research results indicate that the probability that a publicly listed company will have one of its directors named a defendant in a case is 0. 08 %, which suggests a rate of enforcement more similar to the US than the UK. Further, the principal modality of enforcement varies according to whether the company in question is publicly listed or private. Cases involving directors of publicly listed companies {{are more likely to have}} resulted from public enforcement, whereas those brought against directors of private companies are more likely to have been initiated by private parties. Moreover, the substantive issues in cases resulting from public enforcement differ systematically from those brought by private parties, and the research confirms prior findings that insolvency is a trigger for litigation against errant directors. Finally, a significant proportion of private enforcement actions in the dataset are actually initiated by the companies themselves, as opposed to being brought by shareholders. This modality of enforcement, which the data suggest is empirically significant, has not been discussed in prior literature. </p...|$|R

In this paper, we take a broader approach to the issue, combining a "productivity" and an "adoption" approach, while including a search for contextual variables in the firm's strategy that affects complementarity. Analysis of contextual variables is not only interesting per se, but also improves the productivity test for the existence of complementarity. We use our empirical methodology to analyze <b>complementarity</b> <b>between</b> innovation activities: internal research and development (R& D) and external knowledge acquisition. Our results suggest that internal R& D and external knowledge acquisition are complementary innovation activities, but that the degree of complementarity is sensitive to other elements of the firm's strategic environment.

In this study, we used earlier census data and 1 % population survey data to examine {{the distribution of the}} skilled workforce in cities in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) along with its changes, and drew the following three conclusions. First, a highly skilled workforce is the engine of urban development, increasing urban wages and population. Second, big cities can promote <b>complementarity</b> <b>between</b> skill sets so that there are greater numbers of high-skilled and low-skilled workers in those cities. This explains why both low-skilled and high-skilled workforces agglomerate in big cities. Last, <b>complementarity</b> <b>between</b> the low-skilled and high-skilled workforce is inhibited in the PRC’s cities because of the biased household registration system (HRS) toward the high-skilled workforce, resulting in limited supply of low-skilled labor. This policy is not conducive to enhance labor productivity in big cities and to carry out its leading role of economic growth...|$|R

First we design a sophisticated data term that incorporates HSV colour representation with higher order constancy assumptions, completely separate robust penalisation, and constraint normalisation. Our anisotropic smoothness term reduces smoothing in the data constraint direction instead of the image edge direction, while enforcing a strong filling-in effect orthogonal to it. This allows optimal <b>complementarity</b> <b>between</b> both terms and avoids undesirable interference. The high quality of our complementary optic flow (COF) approach is demonstrated by the current top ranking result at the Middlebury benchmark. ...|$|R

Thus, this model predicts investment patterns comparable to the horizontal model but requires neither trade barriers nor reductions in home wages...|$|R
