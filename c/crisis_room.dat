We present a concept of a collaborative system that aims at supporting the production of daily bulletin and situation report production or similar workflows. The central feature of the CoSitRepSys is the collaborative editing of reports and a broad applicability on big wall displays of varying size. The whole system uses just a few simple interaction patterns. There are two separate areas: one for creating and editing situation reports and another for sifting and review of information sources. The key artefact is the big wall display and the information shown thereon. Besides the present operators also remote team members can control what is displayed by using their personal mobile devices, such as laptops, tablets or smart phones.

However, this paper proposes that the relationship between crisis planning and crisis management outcomes is more complex and nuanced relationship the often assumed. Contingency planning which is successful in the pre-crisis stage, does not guarantee a successful crisis response. Correspondingly, contingency planning failures in the pre-crisis stage, do not automatically lead to a flawed crisis response. The reasons rest primarily with the multiple influences on crisis responses – only some of which can be anticipated and planned for. The conclusion provides policy-oriented and analytical reflections which recognise the value of contingency planning, while suggesting that we should not inflate our expectation of contingency planners or rush too quickly to vilify them for a lack of adequate preparations...|$|R

Automatic behavior understanding {{is defined as the}} generation of semantic event descriptions from machine perception. Outputs from available perception modalities can be fused into a world model with a single spatiotemporal reference frame. The fused world model can then be used as input by a reasoning engine that generates semantic event descriptions. We use a newly developed annota-tion tool to generate hypothetical machine perception outputs instead. The applied reasoning engine is based on fuzzy metric temporal logic (FMTL) and situation graph trees (SGTs), promising and universally ap-plicable tools for automatic behavior understanding. The presented case study is automatic behavior report generation for staff training purposes in <b>crisis</b> response control <b>rooms.</b> Various group formations and interac-tion patterns are deduced from person tracks, object information, and information about gestures, body pose, and speech activity...|$|R

In this historical overview, we argue that emergency room problems arise from past decisions that gave hospitals a predominant role in the healthcare system and partly modified their original mission, as well as from counterproductive funding modalities. Other decisions have also weakened primary care services, which are strongly focused on acute health problems and are poorly coordinated {{with the rest of the}} system.

40|$|A {{discussion}} on the prophetic witness {{of the church is}} relevant in many respects. Firstly, most African countries have embraced democracy, without defining its contents; hence, democracy practised in Africa varies from one country to another. Secondly, democracy, itself, has left unpredictable consequences in African societies, where its leaders have cherished what they gain from leadership, rather than thinking in terms of community development. Thirdly, many people have lost confidence in the church in times of misery. The need for a solution to social <b>crisis</b> has created <b>room</b> for alternative modes of public discourse that compete with the church&rsquo;s prophetic voice of: &lsquo;Thus says the Lord&rsquo;. Fourthly, churches seem to have established a dichotomy between theology and societal realities. Fifthly, the church has, so far, concentrated most of its efforts on evangelising to the regular faithful who attend the Sunday service and other meetings and have rather neglected those on the streets. Lastly, &lsquo;armchair sermons&rsquo;, coupled with the effect of democracy seem to have moulded passive and expectant citizens, rather than challenge them to strive for a committed and responsible stewardship.

40|$|Seizure {{disorders}} {{may present}} with {{signs and symptoms}} that are usually associated with psychiatric disorders. Physicians must be alert to this possibility; they should use careful history taking in conjunction with EEGs to avoid misdiagnosing certain cases of psychomotor, petit mal, and grand mal epilepsy. ONLY FAIRLY recently has epilepsy been recognized {{as a group of}} disorders that are primarily organic in ori-gin. Although paroxysmal brain discharges may dis-turb affect, thinking, and behavior, unusual symptoms of epilepsy may be thought to represent so-called func-tional disorders. An automatic assumption that bizarre symptoms indicate psychiatric disorders on a narrow view of the manifestations of seizure disorders may lead to misdiagnosis, especially in emergency <b>rooms,</b> <b>crisis</b> centers, and similar situations. The primary cane physician and the psychiatrist must be alert to the possibility of psychiatric presenta-tions of seizure disorders and take appropriate steps to ensure accurate diagnosis. Even though pressure may exist in some settings to forgo seemingly excessive lab tests and to leave physical examinations to other physi-cians, our patients may benefit if we as psychiatrists use our neunologic expertise. The incidence of misdiag-nosis of seizure disorders is probably small, but to the individual patient the significance is great. Although the incidence of psychiatric disorders is greater in epileptics than in the general popu-lation (1, 2), my concern here is with those symptoms which occur as part of the basic seizure disorder. Grand mal, psychomotor, and petit mal epilepsy are the seizure types I will discuss, although it is conceiv-able that other seizure types could also be mistaken for psychiatric disorders. PSYCHOMOTOR EPILEPSY Psychomotor epilepsy is perhaps the quintessential example of a disorder on the borderline between psy-chiatry and neurology.
