40|$|Involvement of {{the state}} in the {{domestic}} economy has long been considered as useful for enhancing public welfare in modern society. However, since the 1980 s the expenditures devoted to support the domestic economy show a downward and converging development in most OECD countries. This development is examined by means of a comparative analysis over time. Three possible explanations are analysed: firstly, the politics of fiscal stringency in order to curb big government; secondly, the impact of trans-national pressure, in this case from the EMU; and thirdly, the impact of party politics and government in relation to budget choices that affect spending levels on state economic support. The analysis demonstrates that lower levels of state economic support are because of the development of total government outlays and consequently non-welfare or <b>core</b> <b>expenditures</b> are traded off in favour of welfare spending. Furthermore, EMU requirements affect this development. Finally, these developments vary cross-nationally owing to where a policy legacy of the Left (high levels of public spending) existed before the 1980 s and where the Right is present in government after 1980. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd...|$|R

One approach would be to use an index {{of goods and services}} whose prices are market determined and not subject to frequent, idiosyncratic, and transitory changes.

40|$|Objective: Non-shivering {{thermogenesis}} {{in brown}} adipose tissue (BAT) plays {{a central role}} in energy homeostasis. Thioesterase superfamily member 1 (Them 1), a BAT-enriched long chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase, is upregulated by cold and downregulated by warm ambient temperatures. Them 1 −/− mice exhibit increased energy expenditure and resistance to diet-induced obesity and diabetes, but the mechanistic contribution of Them 1 to the regulation of cold thermogenesis remains unknown. Methods: Them 1 −/− and Them 1 +/+ mice were subjected to continuous metabolic monitoring to quantify the effects of ambient temperatures ranging from thermoneutrality (30  °C) to cold (4  °C) on energy <b>expenditure,</b> <b>core</b> body temperature, physical activity and food intake. The effects of Them 1 expression on O 2 consumption rates, thermogenic gene expression and lipolytic protein activation were determined ex vivo in BAT and in primary brown adipocytes. Results: Them 1 suppressed thermogenesis in mice even in the setting of ongoing cold exposure. Without affecting thermogenic gene transcription, Them 1 reduced O 2 consumption rates in both isolated BAT and primary brown adipocytes. This was attributable to decreased mitochondrial oxidation of endogenous but not exogenous fatty acids. Conclusions: These results show that Them 1 may act as a break on uncontrolled heat production and limit the extent of energy expenditure. Pharmacologic inhibition of Them 1 could provide a targeted strategy for the management of metabolic disorders via activation of brown fat...|$|R
40|$|The {{well-known}} Phillips curve {{suggests that}} future inflation depends on {{current and past}} inflation and a measure of economic slack or resource utilization. Using the unemployment gap to measure slack, a simple Phillips curve currently predicts that inflation will remain quite low through 2015. Two variations of the model, which impose a higher anchor for inflation expectations or focus only on a short-term unemployment gap, still predict that inflation will remain low, albeit higher than implied by the basic model. Over the past two years, inflation has remained persistently low. As measured by the <b>core</b> personal consumption <b>expenditures</b> price index (<b>core</b> PCEPI), which excludes volatile energy and food prices, annual inflation has been below the Federal Reserve’s 2 % target since April 2012. Given the recent path of inflation, a natural question to consider is how likely it is to remain low in the future. Recent research using financial market forecasts (Bauer and Christensen 2014) shows that inflation will remain low going forward. In this Economic Letter, we examine the outlook for inflation using model-based forecasts. We rely on the well-known Phillips curve model and examine its implications for inflation {{over the next two}} years.

40|$|Following {{two decades}} of {{relatively}} rapid growth, and a decade of liberalization, there is growing confidence within India, as well as internationally, {{about the state of}} the economy, and India's development potential. Nonetheless, and particularly since the late nineties, when India's states experienced a sharp fiscal deterioration, they have faced a squeeze on development spending, particularly acute in the poorer ones. In response, most state governments embarked on fiscal reforms, aimed at reducing deficits, and enabling effective interventions in priority areas. States in India play an increasingly important role in devising, and implementing policies to stimulate economic growth, and promote human development. But the performance of India's states is increasingly divergent, State deficits and debt levels rose sharply in the late nineties, and off-budget liabilities also increased rapidly. This sharp fiscal deterioration gave rise to state-level fiscal adjustment efforts, which in recent years have shown some signs of improved fiscal performance. Concerns about the level, and composition of fiscal deficits remain. The report states that a halt in reforms would endanger the states quality and quantity of productive expenditures, while debt levels would steadily build. It reviews expenditure reforms - particularly salaries, at the <b>core</b> of <b>expenditure</b> restructuring - and, pensions as a rapidly-mounting liability, which can be contained by parametric reforms, and longer-term structural reforms, while also examines subsidies, exemplifying the difficulties involved in reforming subsidy regimes. Regarding power sector reforms, commercial discipline should be a top priority. Public enterprise reforms are outlined, suggesting that while immediate fiscal gains may not be achieved, such reforms will prevent future budgetary support from keeping loss-making enterprises afloat. On examining revenue reforms, the report indicates these are essential to reduce fiscal imbalances, suggesting the elimination of tax on inter-state exports is critical, and should proceed with, or without the value-added tax (VAT), specifying tax administration reforms are perhaps more important than tax reforms. On strengthening the fiscal federal framework, it is recommended States need more flexibility to borrow, but under a centrally-imposed aggregate borrowing cap. Three institutional reform would therefore help fiscal federalism in India: Finance Commission as a permanent body; entrusting a single agency in compiling timely state-level fiscal data; and, reviewing the role of the Planning Commission...|$|R
40|$|Draft: Please do not quote without permission. The {{relationship}} between local government structure and expenditure has received considerable attention, {{yet there is}} little consensus on how the features of representative government affect local expenditure decisions. The sole exception is city council size, which has consistently {{been found to have}} a positive and significant impact on expenditure. Previous results rely on cross-sectional estimation which may be subject to both omitted variable and potential endogeneity bias. This paper analyzes three components of municipal governments—the form of government, the size of the city council, and the election method of city councilors—and their respective effects on municipal expenditure. In this paper I utilize a comprehensive data set that spans 20 years and contains information on thousands of U. S. cities. The data allow for the use of fixed effects to eliminate time invariant factors which may be biasing previous results. Results from the fixed effects models show that the positive impact of city council size on expenditures is no longer significant. I find that expenditures are invariant to the method of election for all sample sizes and models, except when a more uniform set of public service expenditures is employed. When only a few <b>core</b> areas of <b>expenditure</b> are considered, the fraction of councilors elected by district has a positive and significant effect. In the fixed effects models utilizing cities with populations of 10, 000 or more, mayor-council governments are associated with lower expenditures, but when cities of all sizes are included there is no effect...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has {{emphasized that the}} Federal Reserve under Chairman Alan Greenspan was forward looking, smoothed interest rates, and focused on core inflation. The semiannual monetary policy reports to U. S. Congress indicate that the measure of inflation used in monetary policy deliberations has also been refined over time: For most of the Greenspan period before 2000, inflation forecasts used {{the consumer price index}} (CPI), but in the early 2000 s, inflation forecasts switched to using the <b>core</b> personal consumption <b>expenditures</b> (PCE) deflator. Using information contained in Greenbook forecasts, this article estimates two forward-looking Taylor rules that differ only with respect to the measure of inflation used over 1987 : 1 - 2006 : 4. A Taylor rule that is estimated using a time-varying measure of core inflation-CPI until 2000 and PCE thereafter-depicts parameter stability in the Greenspan years, and tracks the actual path of the federal funds rate during the subperiod 2000 : 1 – 2006 : 4, when the measure of inflation used changed. In contrast, a Taylor rule that is estimated using headline CPI inflation does not depict such parameter stability, and indicates the actual funds rate was too low relative to the level prescribed during the subperiod 2000 : 1 - 2006 : 4, as headline CPI inflation remained elevated because of the continual rise in oil prices. Moreover, in real time during most of this subperiod, core PCE inflation was much lower than what is indicated by the current vintage data. These results highlight the importance of using real-time information in evaluating historical monetary policy actions. Inflation (Finance); Monetary policy...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} implicated an {{inflammatory}} link between obesity and type 2 diabetes. We applied a multidisciplinary approach spanning from in vivo animal physiology to in vitro cell culture and biochemistry {{to address the}} role of obesity-related inflammation in adipose tissue. The inhibitor of κB kinase β (IKKβ) has previously been linked to insulin resistance. High-fat diet dramatically increased protein and kinase activity levels of the two noncanonical IKK family members, IKKε and TBK 1, in adipose tissue. Genetic ablation of IKKε or pharmacologic inhibition of IKKε and TBK 1, using the selective protein kinase inhibitor amlexanox, resulted in many metabolic improvements, including reduced weight gain in mice on a high fat diet. The improvements in IKKε knockout and amlexanox-treated mice on a high fat diet were correlated with increased energy <b>expenditure,</b> <b>core</b> body temperature, adipogenesis, and the proton uncoupling protein, UCP 1 protein levels in adipose tissue. Studies with 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes elucidated the mechanism by which IKKε and TBK 1 regulate cAMP and β-adrenergic signaling in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Expression of IKKε in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes decreased UCP 1 expression in response to β-adrenergic stimulation. The rate of lipolysis, levels of cAMP, and phosphorylation of PKA substrates such as hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) were also diminished in response to isoproterenol or forskolin by overexpression of IKKε or TBK 1 in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. IKKε and TBK 1 are induced by inflammatory stimuli, such as tumor necrosis α (TNFα) and Poly(I:C), and blockade of these kinases reversed the diminution of β-adrenergic signaling, cAMP, and lipolysis. The reduction of cAMP levels in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes expressing IKKε or TBK 1 was reversed by the phosphodiesterase 3 B inhibitor, zardaverine. IKKε and TBK 1 were found to bind to and phosphorylate PDE 3 B at serine 318, resulting in its activation and 14 - 3 - 3 β binding. These studies suggest that reduced cAMP production through phosphorylation and activation of PDE 3 B by IKKε and TBK 1 is responsible for mediating the effects of IKKε and TBK 1 in adipocytes...|$|R
40|$|Since the double-digit {{inflation}} of the 1970 s, the Federal Reserve {{has consistently}} pursued {{the goal of}} price stability in the United States. And, since {{the second half of}} 2002, the year-to-year increase in the core Consumer Price Index (that is, excluding the relatively volatile food and energy components) has been below 2 %, which, according to Fed Governor Bernanke, is probably the de facto equivalent of price stability (Bernanke 2003). This development in the U. S. economy inflation dynamics is unambiguously an important achievement. However, last year, as the prospects for growth remained uncertain, there were concerns that the downward tendency of inflation might continue, posing a remote, but still possible, risk that the inflation rate could fall to a level that is too low. For instance, the balance-of-risks statement issued {{at the close of the}} FOMC meeting on May 6, 2003, recognized explicitly that the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level. This Economic Letter examines the distinct features of deflation, discusses why it is a matter of concern to the public and to policymakers in general, and looks at the recent experience of the inflation and deflation in the U. S. and other countries. What is deflation? Let’s first be clear about the definition of deflation. Deflation refers not to falling prices anywhere in the economy, but to a decline in the general price level across the economy. In other words, it is a decline in the price level, not a decline in the growth rate of the price level. The latter is often referred to as “disinflation, ” which means a decline in the rate of inflation. It also is useful to be clear that, for the purposes here, one need not make a strict distinction between the low inflation and the deflation. Part of the reason is that, in reality, it is hard to distinguish between very low inflation and modest deflation. This is because inflation as measured by regular price indices is often biased upward; for instance, according to statistical analysis, the annual inflation rate as measured by <b>core</b> Personal Consumption <b>Expenditure</b> (PCE) price index is probably biased upward by about 0. 5 percentage point, and the bias can be even a bit higher when measured by cor...|$|R
