5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b> This point is +90° if you are watching the North <b>Celestial</b> <b>Pole</b> or −90° if you are observing the Southern <b>Celestial</b> <b>Pole.</b> The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E
5|$|The German {{cartographer}} Johann Bayer {{used the}} Greek letters alpha to theta to label {{the most prominent}} stars in the constellation, while his countryman Johann Elert Bode subsequently added iota to phi. Only lambda and pi remain in use, likely because of their proximity to the north <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b> Within the constellation's borders, there are 39stars brighter {{than or equal to}} apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E
5|$|Declination is {{positive}} for an eastward deviation {{of the field}} relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with {{the direction of a}} <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b> Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).|$|E
50|$|The <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> {{are also}} the <b>poles</b> of the <b>celestial</b> {{equatorial}} coordinate system, meaning they have declinations of +90 degrees and &minus;90 degrees (for {{the north and south}} <b>celestial</b> <b>poles,</b> respectively).|$|R
50|$|The {{north and}} south <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> are the two {{imaginary}} points in the sky where the Earth's axis of rotation, indefinitely extended, intersects the celestial sphere. The {{north and south}} <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> appear permanently directly overhead to an observer at the Earth's North Pole and South Pole, respectively. As the Earth spins on its axis, the two <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> remain fixed in the sky, and all other points appear to rotate around them, completing one circuit per day (strictly per sidereal day).|$|R
50|$|The {{celestial}} meridian is undefined when the observer {{is at the}} North Pole or South Pole, since at these two points, the zenith and nadir are on the <b>celestial</b> <b>poles,</b> and any great circle passing through the <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> also passes through the zenith and nadir.|$|R
5|$|Located at the {{northern}} edge of the constellation and just southwest of Achernar is Alpha Hydri, a white sub-giant star of magnitude 2.9, situated 72 light-years from Earth. Of spectral type F0IV, it is beginning to cool and enlarge as it uses up its supply of hydrogen. It is twice as massive and 3.3 times as wide as our sun and 26 times more luminous. A line drawn between Alpha Hydri and Beta Centauri is bisected by the south <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} star is the 2.8-magnitude Beta Hydri, also the closest reasonably bright star {{to the south}} <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b> Pulsating between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, Gamma Hydri is a variable red giant 60 times the diameter of our Sun. Lying near it is VW Hydri, {{one of the brightest}} dwarf novae in the heavens. Four star systems in Hydrus have been found to have exoplanets to date, including HD 10180, which could bear up to nine planetary companions.|$|E
5|$|Capella {{is closer}} to the north <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> than any other first {{magnitude}} star. Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands. Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are {{on opposite sides of the}} pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris. Visible halfway between the Belt of Orion and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the winter sky in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|Celestial bodies {{other than}} Earth also have {{similarly}} defined <b>celestial</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{meridian}} plane is any plane {{perpendicular to the}} celestial equator and containing the <b>celestial</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{seen from}} the equator, objects on the <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> stay at fixed points on the horizon.|$|R
5|$|The {{path of the}} Sun in {{the local}} sky {{over the course of}} a local day during Uranus's and its major moons' summer {{solstice}} is quite different from that seen on most other Solar System worlds. The major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The Sun would appear to follow a circular path around Uranus's <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from it. Near the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or due south (depending on the season). At latitudes higher than 7°, the Sun would trace a circular path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set.|$|E
5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Whether a star is {{circumpolar}} {{depends upon}} the observer's latitude. Since the altitude of the north or south <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> (whichever is visible) equals the absolute value of the observer's latitude, any star whose angular distance from the visible <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> {{is less than the}} absolute latitude will be circumpolar. For example, if the observer's latitude is 50° N, any star will be circumpolar if it is less than 50° from the north <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b> If the observer's latitude is 35° S, then all stars within 35° of the south <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> are circumpolar. Stars on the celestial equator are not circumpolar when observed from any latitude in either hemisphere of the Earth.|$|E
5000|$|Effective latitude:If that dial-plane is {{horizontal}}, then it's {{a horizontal}} dial (bifilar, or straight-style). Then, {{of course the}} north <b>celestial</b> <b>pole's</b> altitude, measured from the dial-plane, is the latitude of the location. Well then, if the flat-dial is reclined, declined, or reclined-&-declined, everything {{is the same as}} if it the dial were horizontal, with the <b>celestial</b> <b>pole's</b> altitude, measured with respect to the dial-plane, treated as the latitude.|$|R

25|$|Sigma Octantis, the {{southern}} pole star, is a magnitude5.4 star just over 1degree {{away from the}} true South <b>Celestial</b> <b>Pole.</b> Its relative faintness means {{that it is not}} practical for navigation. Conveniently for navigators, there are other, much easier methods for locating {{the southern}} <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is more {{difficult}} to find the south <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> in the sky at this moment, as that area is a particularly bland portion of the sky, and the nominal south pole star is Sigma Octantis, which with magnitude 5.5 is barely {{visible to the naked eye}} even under ideal conditions. That will change from the 80th to the 90th centuries, however, when the south <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> travels through the False Cross.|$|E
25|$|NGC 188 is an {{open cluster}} that has the {{distinction}} of being the closest open cluster to the north <b>celestial</b> <b>pole,</b> as well as one of the oldest known open clusters.|$|E
50|$|The {{poles of}} astronomical bodies are {{determined}} {{based on their}} axis of rotation {{in relation to the}} <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> of the <b>celestial</b> sphere.|$|R
50|$|The {{identity}} of the pole stars gradually changes over time because the <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> exhibit a slow continuous drift through the star field. The primary {{reason for this is}} the precession of Earth's rotational axis, which causes its orientation to change over time. Precession causes the <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> to trace out circles on the celestial sphere approximately once every 26,000 years, passing close to different stars at different times (with an additional slight shift due to the proper motion of the stars).|$|R
50|$|The <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> do {{not remain}} {{permanently}} fixed {{against the background}} of the stars. Because of a phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes, the poles trace out circles on the celestial sphere, with a period of about 25,700 years. The Earth's axis is also subject to other complex motions which cause the <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> to shift slightly over cycles of varying lengths; see nutation, polar motion and axial tilt. Finally, over very long periods the positions of the stars themselves change, because of the stars' proper motions.|$|R
25|$|When {{viewed from}} the north <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> (i.e., from the {{approximate}} direction of the star Polaris) the Moon orbits Earth anticlockwise and Earth orbits the Sun anticlockwise, and the Moon and Earth rotate on their own axes anticlockwise.|$|E
25|$|For example, the {{constellation}} Crux, the Southern Cross, currently points toward the South <b>Celestial</b> <b>Pole,</b> if one draws {{a line from}} Gamma Crucis to Alpha Crucis. Another method includes an asterism made up of Sigma, Chi, Tau, and Upsilon Octantis, which form a distinctive trapezoid shape.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of the precession is a changing pole star. Currently Polaris is extremely well suited to mark {{the position of the}} north <b>celestial</b> <b>pole,</b> as Polaris is a moderately bright star with a visual magnitude of 2.1 (variable), and it is located about one degree from the pole.|$|E
5000|$|As on Earth, {{the effect}} of {{precession}} causes {{the north and south}} <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> to move in a very large circle, but on Mars the cycle is 175,000 Earth years ...|$|R
50|$|These {{concepts}} {{are important for}} understanding celestial coordinate systems - frameworks for measuring the positions of objects in the sky. Certain reference lines and planes on Earth, when projected onto the celestial sphere, form the bases of the reference systems. These include the Earth's equator, axis, and the Earth's orbit. At their intersections with the celestial sphere, these form the celestial equator, {{the north and south}} <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> and the ecliptic, respectively. As the celestial sphere is considered infinite in radius, all observers see the <b>celestial</b> equator, <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> and ecliptic at the same place against the background stars.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{types of}} sundials are {{designed}} with a fixed gnomon that is not aligned with the <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> like a vertical obelisk. Such sundials are covered below under the section, [...] "Nodus-based sundials".|$|R
25|$|The {{right-hand}} rule {{can be used}} {{to indicate}} the direction of the angular velocity. If the thumb of the right hand points to the north <b>celestial</b> <b>pole,</b> its fingers curl in the direction that the Moon orbits Earth, Earth orbits the Sun, and the Moon and Earth rotate on their own axes.|$|E
25|$|As the observer's {{latitude}} increases (he travels north) so {{does the}} declination. The pole rises over the horizon by an angle of the same amount. The elevation at the terrestrial North Pole is 90° (straight up) and the <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> has a declination of the same value. The latitude also is 90.|$|E
25|$|As one travels {{south of}} the Equator, the {{opposite}} happens. The south <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> appears increasingly high in the sky, and all the stars lying within an increasingly large circle centered on that pole become circumpolar about it. This continues until one reaches the Earth's South Pole where, once again, all visible stars are circumpolar.|$|E
50|$|In astronomy, {{cardinal}} {{points of the}} disk of an astronomical body may be four points defined by {{the direction in which}} the <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> are located, as seen {{from the center of the}} disk.|$|R
50|$|The {{equinoctial}} colure is the meridian {{or great}} {{circle of the}} celestial sphere which passes through the <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> and the two equinoxes: the first point of Aries and the first point of Libra.|$|R
50|$|In other cases, the hour-lines are not spaced evenly, {{even though}} the shadow rotates uniformly. If the gnomon is not aligned with the <b>celestial</b> <b>poles,</b> even its shadow will not rotate uniformly, and the hour lines must be {{corrected}} accordingly. The rays of light that graze {{the tip of a}} gnomon, or which pass through a small hole, or reflect from a small mirror, trace out a cone aligned with the <b>celestial</b> <b>poles.</b> The corresponding light-spot or shadow-tip, if it falls onto a flat surface, will trace out a conic section, such as a hyperbola, ellipse or (at the North or South Poles) a circle.|$|R
