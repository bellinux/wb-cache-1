40|$|Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus and Acquired Immune-Deficiency Syndrome {{communication}} {{remains one}} of the most significant tools in the fight against HIV/AIDS given the absence of the cure to fight the growth and spread of the global pandemic. Through the use of information, HIV/AIDS communication seeks to empower recipients or societies with skills that will help reduce their risk of infection. South Africa has seen a high visibility of HIV/AIDS <b>communication</b> programmes or <b>campaigns</b> aimed at empowering different audiences, whilst paying particular emphasis on the most vulnerable. Young people, in particular young women, have a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS in South Africa. This has prompted the development of many youth focused <b>communication</b> <b>campaigns</b> which have sought to address factors that increase young people`s vulnerability to HIV infection. However, despite the high visibility of HIV/AIDS <b>communication</b> <b>campaigns</b> targeting young people, high risk behaviours are still being seen among young women. Important to note are the high teenage pregnancy rates, growing abuse of substances and even the premature engagement of sexual activities among female youths. This, therefore, raises questions on the effect of HIV/AIDS communication programmes in encouraging protective behaviour against risky behavioural practices amongst young women. Using both quantitative and qualitative research approaches to this study, an investigation was conducted into whether current HIV/AIDS <b>communication</b> <b>campaigns</b> have been limited (in terms of effectiveness) when it comes to communicating with young women on issues relating to HIV/AIDS. Awareness of HIV/AIDS and HIV/AIDS communication programmes, relevance of HIV/AIDS communication programmes, the factors that influence the use and understanding of HIV/AIDS messages and the impact of HIV/AIDS communication on attitude and behaviour change amongst female youths is measured. A total of 350 questionnaire copies were self-administered to 350 participants, with a 100 percent response rate. From the 350 participants, seventy five took part in focus group discussions. Data obtained was analysed using SPSS (for descriptive statistics), and the grounded theory. The results of the study indicate that all participants were aware of HIV/AIDS with at least 60 % of the participants aware of at least three HIV/AIDS <b>communication</b> <b>campaigns.</b> When measuring the relevance of HIV/AIDS <b>communication</b> <b>campaigns,</b> participants (58 %) indicate that issues discussed in most HIV/AIDS <b>communication</b> <b>campaigns</b> increased the relevance of HIV/AIDS messages to young women although such relevance was, for some respondents, affected by limited access to <b>communication</b> <b>campaigns.</b> Results also show that levels of knowledge and understanding of factors that expose young women to HIV infections differed amongst participants in as much as the factors that hinder the use of advice contained in HIV/AIDS messages also differed. Sixty-nine percent of the participants have knowledge and a better understanding of factors that expose young females to HIV infections. Twenty-five percent of the participants identified peer pressure, whilst 23 % identified limited access to HIV/AIDS <b>communication</b> <b>campaigns</b> and another 18 % identified a disregard of HIV/AIDS messages as significant factors that limit the ability of individuals to implement advice contained in HIV/AIDS messages. The results also indicate that although HIV/AIDS <b>communication</b> <b>campaigns</b> seem to have played a role in empowering some participants, there is still a significant minority whom communication has not effectively communicated with. Based on these findings, the study suggests, amongst other things, the need to intensify current HIV/AIDS <b>communication</b> <b>campaigns</b> through the provision of consistent messages on appropriate condom use, the identification of easily accessible communication channels and the development of thought provoking and attention grabbing campaigns as well as the need to continue to directly involve young women in the processes of their own development...|$|R
