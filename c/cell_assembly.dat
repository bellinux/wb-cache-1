This paper presents a plausible model of sequential memory at the neurological level based on the theory of <b>cell</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The basic idea is that sequences in the brain are represented by <b>cell</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Each item of the sequence and the sequential association between the items are represented by <b>cell</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Simulation results show that the model is capable of recognizing and discriminating multiple sequences stored in memory. The <b>cell</b> <b>assemblies</b> that represent the sequential association between two items are activated if these items occur in the input in the correct order.

We show that multiple <b>cell</b> <b>assemblies</b> generated by external stimuli can survive noisy spontaneous network activity for an adequate range of the strength of STD.

5000|$|Hebb viewed {{motivation}} and learning as related properties. He believed that {{everything in the}} brain was interrelated and worked together. His theory was that everything we experience in our environment fires a set of neurons called a <b>cell</b> <b>assembly.</b> This <b>cell</b> <b>assembly</b> is the brain's thoughts or ideas. These cell assemblies then work together to form phase sequences, which are streams of thoughts. [...] Once these cell assemblies and phase sequences are formed, they can be activated by stimulation from the environment. Therefore, the more stimulating and rich the environment, the more the cell assemblies grow and learn. This theory played into his beliefs in education. Hebb believed that the environment {{was very important to}} learning in children. Children learn by building up these cell assemblies and phase sequences. An enriched environment with varied opportunities for sensory and motor experiences contribute to children developing the cell assemblies and phase sequences necessary for continued learning in adulthood. To attempt to prove this, Hebb and his daughters raised pet rats at home. By raising them in an enriched environment, the rats showed improved maze learning in adulthood.

Due to {{the limited}} {{computational}} capacity of visual systems and the limited capacity to perform several mental operations at once, animals only select {{a small proportion of}} the stimuli available at any one time.

As a result, when facing a previously learned input, the system is able to retrieve the cognitive map it belongs to. As a consequence, ambiguous inputs which could belong to multiple cognitive maps can be disambiguated by the knowledge of the context, i. e.  the cognitive map. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|Until today, {{there does}} not exist enough {{evidence}} to contradict Hebb’s definition of a <b>cell</b> <b>assembly.</b> From the physiological point of view, the idea requires variable excitatory synapses that obey Hebb’s rule.

However, this specific {{point of view is}} difficult to test due to the unavailability of experimental data. Valentino Braitenberg {{was the first one to}} give interpretation to the theory of cell assemblies in terms of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology [20]. Most of the ideas presented on Braitenberg’s work have been thoroughly explored and served as the basis of <b>cell</b> <b>assembly</b> theory. For a detailed discussion of the current state of <b>cell</b> <b>assembly</b> theory see [21]. According to Hebb’s definition, a <b>cell</b> <b>assembly</b> represents only one concept in our brain.

In an effort to investigate if the cortical network is sufficient to contain all of our concepts Palm formulated the main problem of the theory of cell assemblies.

However, due to the complexity of the definition; the number of neurons on a brain-sized neuronal network; and the number of connections per neuron, it still may not be possible, in practice, to solve the problem of finding all cell assemblies.
