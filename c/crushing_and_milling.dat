That two rival companies, if they happened to hit upon ore, might cut one another's throats by erecting two sets of furnaces or pumping plants, and bringing two separate streams to the spot, where one would answer. In short--to employ the golden word--that amalgamation might prove better in the end than competition; and that he advised, at least, a conference on the subject.|$|E

The {{aim of the}} thesis was to examine samples of regionally grown cereals, oilseeds and legumes using NIR analyzer DA 7200 and compare the results to the tables and chemical analysis. A total of 26 samples were used. For the whole, <b>crushed</b> <b>and</b> <b>milled</b> grains <b>and</b> seeds, according {{to the type of}} the sample, analysis of water, crude protein, crude fiber, crude fat and starch were made. The content of crude protein was verified by the chemical laboratory. NIR measurements showed discrepancies in the case of evaluation of individual substances for the whole, <b>crushed</b> <b>and</b> <b>milled</b> grains or seeds, although the same material was used and the measured values should be similar. We have detected for example crude protein content in Apache (Litava) wheat sample by NIRS analysis 129, 3 +- 1, 78 g. kg- 1 for the whole grains, 116, 5 +- 0, 72 g. kg- 1 for the <b>crushed</b> grains <b>and</b> 100, 9 +- 2, 71 g. kg- 1 for the milled grains. The chemical analysis for the same sample showed the value of 120, 8 g. kg- 1. According to the literature, the crude protein content in wheat should be between 118 and 132, 1 g. kg- 1. When evaluating the characteristics of the whole, <b>crushed</b> <b>and</b> <b>milled</b> samples crude protein content reached 135, 6 +- 8, 78 g. kg- 1 for the whole, 132, 3 +- 9, 97 g. kg- 1 for the <b>crushed</b> <b>and</b> 130, 5 +- 11, 55 g. kg- 1 for the milled samples. Given that the crude protein measurement results were in accordance with the chemical analyses and the tabular values, it is apparent that the NIR analyzer is working properly. The results of this thesis, however, bring the presumption that the device setting is now not suitable for multiple analyses of different materials...|$|R

40|$|In the Mining Industry, Rock Blasting can be {{considered}} as the first phase of comminution. The downstream phases of comminution are mechanical, and consist in consecutive stages of <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>milling</b> for grain size reduction. The total energy of mechanical comminution depends on grain size and on the resistance of the material to grindability. Usually, the first is quantified by the grains size distribution or one of its KPIs (such as the diameters X 50 or X 80), while the latter by the Working Index (WI), representing the amount of energy necessary {{to reduce the size of}} grains of a determined amount of material to the desired equivalent diameter (usually expressed in kWh/t). It is widely recognized that it is possible to manage the output of a blast in terms of grain size distribution varying specific charge (Powder Factor, P. F.) and charge distribution; specific algorithms such as the KUZ-RAM or the SWEBREC have been created to predict such output. Also, Katzabanis et al. have demonstrated how higher P. Fs. weaken the blasted material by creating micro-fractures that reduce its WI. This paper focuses on a related aspect: the influence of charge distribution on the specific comminution energy in <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>milling.</b> Small-scale blasts have been performed on 14 limestone blocks with different P. Fs. and charge distribution. For every P. F., charges have been designed to simulate concentraded and distributed geometries. Concentrated charges simulate open-cast blasts with large-diameter holes, with large burdens and spacings. Distributed charges simulate bench blasts with small-diameter holes and reduced burden and spacing. Three control blocks have been fragmented by mechanical means for comparison. For every sample has been determined the grain size distribution, the Crushing Specific Energy and the WI in ball mill. Results confirm the existence of precise correlations between charge distributions and the specific energy of mechanical comminution in <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>milling.</b> It is finally discussed the opportunity of adjusting charge diameters and distributions in open-cast blasts to improve the output of the comminutions circuit...|$|E

40|$|Titania slag is a {{feedstock}} to {{the pigment}} industry, {{which in turn}} provides titania pigment to producers of everyday products like paper, cosmetics and toothpaste. Titania slag is the primary product of the pyrometallurgical process of ilmenite smelting – the other products being iron and CO gas. Titania slag is typically tapped from the furnace into blocks of approximately 20 tons. After cooling these blocks are <b>crushed</b> <b>and</b> <b>milled</b> to size fractions suitable for the processes of the pigment producers. These processes are broadly grouped into two types of technology: the chloride route (during which titania slag is reacted with chlorine and subsequently re oxidised thereby removing the impurities) and the sulphate route (in this process the titania slag is purified after dissolving the slag in sulphuric acid). Due {{to the nature of}} these two processes, several specifications are imposed {{on the quality of the}} titania slags. The fluidised-bed technology used in the chloride process limits the size distribution of the slag to between 106 µm and 850 µm. Ilmenite smelting industries consequently <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> <b>mill</b> the titania slag to below 850 µm. The fraction below 106 µm is then sold to the sulphate market. Since the coarser chloride grade product is the more valuable product, slag producers continuously strive to improve the ratio between the coarser and finer fractions. This study reports on parameters which influence the particle size distribution of titania slags and therefore the split between the coarser (more valuable) and finer (less valuable) products. Pilot-scale slag ingots were used to identify chemical and process variables which influence the yield of coarser material. The microstructure of as-cast <b>and</b> <b>milled</b> slag was examined, and indicated a role of silicate phases in the crushing behaviour. Industrial-scale slag ingots were used to test whether the roles of tapping rate and water cooling (as identified from the pilot-scale ingots) also applied under industrial conditions. A numerical method was applied to estimate the thermal conductivity of the solidified slag (from measurements on pilot-scale ingots), and to predict the cooling and solidification behaviour of industrial-scale ingots. The study concludes that the chemical composition and cooling conditions of the slag block play central roles in the final particle size distribution of the slag.

40|$|A {{viability}} {{study was}} undertaken {{on a farm}} Zandrivierspoort 210 JP, in the Pilanesberg Alkaline Complex to investigate the red syenite deposit. The red syenite deposit of interest {{is located in the}} south-western quadrant of the Pilanesberg. It is a potential source of nepheline, which is used as a flux in glass and ceramics industry. The study was aimed at establishing the demand for the material in South Africa and the market logistics related to its exploitation. Glass and ceramics manufacturers have different specifications as far as the quality and the product form is concerned. A market study conducted indicated that glass manufacturers require already beneficiated material with a low Fe content, depending on the kind of glass being manufactured. Ceramics manufactures also want material with low Fe content, but the material can be unbeneficiated as most of these factories already have facilities to remove Fe and other gangue. The common requirement is that material must be <b>crushed</b> <b>and</b> <b>milled</b> to a specific size. Red Syenite complies with the specifications of the ceramics manufacturer and did not comply directly with the specification of the glass manufacturer. The main reason for not non-compliance with glass specifications {{can be attributed to the}} fact that the material supplied was unbeneficiated. A major concern from the industry is the continuity of production from the deposit and an assurance of constant quality. It was also established that the availability of substitutes such as feldspar at a lower cost than nepheline results in an unwillingness of potential users to source nepheline despite its advantages. It is recommended that extensive geological studies be undertaken to confirm the resources and reserves of the entire nepheline-bearing deposits in the Pilanesberg. The mining of the deposit will be undertaken by employing a quarrying method, which will be followed by opencast to a depth of 50 m. The Run-Of-Mine (ROM) will be <b>crushed</b> <b>and</b> <b>milled</b> to sizes specified by clients and the beneficiation process will follow. A financial investigation based on the known facts about the deposit established that capital, production rate, and selling price have the highest influence on the viability of the project. Transport and operating costs in this case showed a less significant influence on the viability of the project. Dissertation (MSc (ESPM)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007. Geologyunrestricte...|$|R

Starting from excavation of limestone, raw material <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>milling,</b> clinker manufacturing, cement grinding and bulk & bag material transportation demands use of natural resources {{in the form of}} material and energy. Driving of sustainability initiatives in the cement industry has gained focus {{over a period of time}} and reducing the non-renewable energy usage in the thermal process of clinker manufacturing has been identified as a key area to drive. In the traditional cement manufacturing process, the thermal energy demand of the cement kiln is supplied through the use of fuel such as coal and heavy furnace oil which is a non-renewable energy source. The initiative to replace traditional fuel usage by using alternative fuel derived from the industrial wastes unfolds cement industry to drive sustainability in two aspects. Firstly, through replacing coal and hence conserving a non-renewable energy and secondly through making the cement kilns available under controlled conditions to thermally destruct hazardous and non-hazardous waste and thereby providing an environmentally sound final destination to dispose their waste to the industrial waste generators.

TPIEC 18 O 2 SSITKA experiments combined with SIMS analysis of the depth profiles of Pr 18 O and Ce 18 O suggest thatfast oxygen diffusion in composites is provided by domains of disordered perovskite-like phases as well as Pr,Y-doped ceria. For best composites, {{the value of the}} oxygen chemical diffusion coefficient estimated by theweight relaxation technique exceeds that of well known LSFC–GDC composite...|$|E
50|$|Giffen Limeworks dated {{from the}} mid- to late 19th century and later. They were {{probably}} the last traditional limeworks to work in Scotland, closing in 1972. A substantial amount remained, the kilns being essentially intact in 2009, with a bank of two single-draw rubble kilns, reinforced with buttresses and with old rails, and heightened in brick. Progressive demolition has been taking place since 2009. Covered conveyors linked the segmental-arched draw holes with a wood-framed, corrugated-iron <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> bagging <b>mill.</b> The works were at map reference: NS 3645 5073.|$|R
25|$|Conventional open-pit mining {{techniques}} {{are used to}} mine natural zeolites. The overburden is removed to allow access to the ore. The ore may be blasted or stripped for processing by using tractors equipped with ripper blades and front-end loaders. In processing, the ore is <b>crushed,</b> dried, <b>and</b> <b>milled.</b> The milled ore may be air-classified as to particle size and shipped in bags or bulk. The crushed product may be screened to remove fine material when a granular product is required, and some pelletized products are produced from fine material.|$|R
50|$|It {{was well}} known for its gold mining equipment, {{including}} stamper batteries <b>and</b> ore <b>crushing</b> <b>mills,</b> <b>and</b> {{played an important role}} in equipping Victoria's first mineral boom in the 1850s and '60s. Major facilities included a Bessemer converter (1887) and a cast-iron pipe-making shop which produced water, sewerage and hydraulic pipes, and structural columns, including those for Princes Bridge.|$|R
