50|$|Pyridazines {{are rare}} in nature, {{possibly}} reflecting {{the scarcity of}} naturally occurring hydrazines, common building blocks for the synthesis of these heterocycles. The pyridazine structure is a popular pharmacophore which is found within a number of herbicides such as credazine, pyridafol and pyridate. It is also found within the structure of several drugs such as cefozopran, <b>cadralazine,</b> minaprine, pipofezine, and hydralazine.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY We {{performed}} simultaneous noninvasive {{measurements of}} common carotid artery and brachial artery hemodynamics in nine normal subjects and 10 subjects with sustained essential hypertension. In hypertensive subjects, brachial artery blood flow and forearm vascular resistance {{were in the}} normal range while carotid artery blood flow and carotid artery resistance were decreased and increased, respectively. The most important findings were {{the changes in the}} internal caliber of large arteries. Although the brachial and carotid artery diameters of hypertensive subjects were measured for the same level of mean arterial pressure, brachial artery diameter was significantly increased and carotid artery diameter was strictly normal as compared with values found in normal subjects. To assess whether carotid artery circulation could influence the baroreceptor reflex response to arteriolar vasodilation, carotid artery and brachial artery hemodynamics were measured in imme-diate succession in normotensive and hypertensive subjects before and after oral administration of <b>cadralazine,</b> a dihydralazine derivative. After <b>cadralazine</b> treatment, carotid artery tangential ten-sion decreased in hypertensive subjects, and the changes were significantly correlated to the Increase in heart rate. A similar correlation was found in normal subjects, but it was reset toward higher heart rates. These results indicate that the carotid artery does not behave like the brachial artery in respons...|$|E
