5000|$|Due to {{limitations}} in 40-pin packaging, the SAM contains a duplicate of the VDG's internal 12-bit <b>address</b> <b>counter.</b> Normally this counter's settings {{are set to}} duplicate the VDG's display mode. However, this is not required and results {{in the creation of}} some new display modes not possible when the VDG is used in a system alone. Instead of the VDG requesting data from RAM by itself, the VDG is [...] "fed" [...] data by the SAM's internal copy of the VDG <b>address</b> <b>counter.</b> This process is called [...] "Interleaved Direct Memory Access" [...] (IDMA) by Motorola and ensures that the processor and VDG always have full access to this shared memory resource with no wait states or contention.|$|R
50|$|In each case, {{the result}} is the XOR of the <b>current</b> <b>address</b> with the next address. XOR of this with the <b>current</b> <b>address</b> in R1 leaves the next address. R2 is left with the {{requisite}} XOR pair of the (now) <b>current</b> <b>address</b> and the predecessor.|$|R

One listing includes over 50 distinct uses.The 50 or so applications can be roughly classified under a few broad headings. There are visual similarities between practices in different categories.

The categories include : ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a member}} of the Intel MCS-85 device family, the 8237 is an 8-bit device with 16-bit addressing. However, it is {{compatible}} with the 8086/88 microprocessors. The IBM PC and PC XT models (machine types 5150 and 5160) have an 8088 CPU and an 8-bit system bus architecture; the latter interfaces directly to the 8237, but the 8088 has a 20-bit address bus, so four additional 4-bit address latches, one for each DMA channel, are added alongside the 8237 to augment the <b>address</b> <b>counters.</b> However, because these external latches are separate from the 8237 <b>address</b> <b>counters,</b> they are never automatically incremented or decremented during DMA operations, making it impossible to perform a DMA operation across a 64 KiB address boundary. Attempts to cross a 64 KiB boundary in a DMA transfer will wrap around within one 64 KiB block of memory. (For example, if a DMA channel and the associated address latch were programmed to transfer 256 bytes to ascending addresses starting at address 0x3FF8C, instead of transferring to addresses 0x3FF8C through 0x4008B, data would be transferred to addresses 0x3FF8C through 0x3FFFF and then to 0x30000 through 0x3008B.) ...|$|R

It also featured 64 bytes of scratchpad memory, accessed by the ISAR register in cells (register windows) of eight, which meant external RAM was not always needed for small applications. In addition, the 2-chip processor did not need support chips, unlike others which needed seven or more.|$|R

50|$|In a constructivist approach, {{the focus}} is on the sociocultural {{conventions}} of academic discourse such as citing evidence, hedging and boosting claims, interpreting the literature to back one's own claims, and <b>addressing</b> <b>counter</b> claims. These conventions are inherent to a constructivist approach as they place value on the communicative, interpersonal nature of academic writing with a strong focus on how the reader receives the message. The act of citing others’ work is more than accurate attribution; it is an important exercise in critical thinking in the construction of an authorial self.|$|R
