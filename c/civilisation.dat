5|$|Early monasteries {{throughout}} Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman classical <b>civilisation.</b> The Church {{eventually became}} the dominant influence in Western <b>civilisation</b> {{into the modern}} age. Many Renaissance figures were sponsored by the church. The 16th century, however, began to see challenges to the Church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures in the Protestant Reformation, {{as well as in}} the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the Enlightenment. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the Church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the New World.|$|E

40|$|Two {{fundamental}} problems for extraterrestrial intelligences (ETIs) attempting to establish interstellar communication are timing and energy consumption. Humanity's study of exoplanets via their transit across the host star highlights {{a means of}} solving both problems. An ETI 'A' can communicate with ETI 'B' if B is observing transiting planets in A's star system, either by building structures to produce artificial transits observable by B, or by emitting signals at B during transit, at significantly lower energy consumption than typical electromagnetic transmission schemes. This can produce a network of interconnected <b>civilisations,</b> establishing contact via observing each other's transits. Assuming that <b>civilisations</b> reside in a Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ), I conduct Monte Carlo Realisation simulations of the establishment and growth of this network, and analyse its properties {{in the context of}} graph theory. I find that at any instant, only a few <b>civilisations</b> are correctly aligned to communicate via transits. However, we should expect the true network to be cumulative, where a "handshake" connection at any time guarantees connection in the future via e. g. electromagnetic signals. In all our simulations, the cumulative network connects all <b>civilisations</b> together in a complete network. If <b>civilisations</b> share knowledge of their network connections, the network can be fully complete on timescales of order a hundred thousand years. Once established, this network can connect any two <b>civilisations</b> either directly, or via intermediate <b>civilisations,</b> with a path much less than the dimensions of the GHZ.
