25|$|The {{development}} proposed would {{differ significantly}} {{from that of a}} typical zoo in that animals would be exhibited in a natural environment rather than in cages. In 1964, the park was assessed financially and then moved onto the next phase; this resulted in three alternative developments. There was an idea for a <b>conservation</b> <b>farm,</b> a game preserve, and a natural environment zoo. The natural environment zoo development was chosen over the <b>conservation</b> <b>farm</b> and game preserve even though it was the most expensive option. The estimated initial cost was $1,755,430.|$|R

50|$|Bromfield {{grew up in}} Pleasant Valley. When he {{returned}} there as an adult, he wanted to buy an old farm—the Herring farm. Eventually, he bought the farm from Clement Herring in 1939. He also bought adjacent farms in 1940 and 1941. In all, he owned 595 acres of land. The Bromfield family moved to Pleasant Valley in 1939 and lived in the “Fleming house” until their “Big House” was built. Bromfield chose architect Louis Lamoreux of Mansfield to help him design and construct a Greek revival style home. The original Herring house {{was used as the}} center of the construction. The Big House was expanded from this focus point and made to look like sections had been added on over the years. Bromfield was constantly ordering changes to rooms and walls. Thus, the project was dragged out for 18 months. The 32-room western reserve, where Bromfield wrote many of his books, attracted film stars, artists, politicians, writers, and conservationists annually. As many as 20,000 people visited the farm every year. Sunday tours alone attracted 100 to 200 people. The farm spread over 1000 acres of land. At one point, 200 acres were set aside for apple trees, but they ended up costing Bromfield money. So he got out of apple production. He also stopped his egg production, as well as his sheep and hog breeding. He chose to focus on beef and dairy. Additionally, Bromfield developed a technique known as <b>conservation</b> <b>farming.</b> This was based on grass farming, which produced large quantities of forage and pasture. Malabar Farm became a national model for sustainable agriculture. In addition to this, Bromfield experimented with composting using manure from livestock on the farm. Square fields were changed to follow {{the lay of the land}} so as to discourage erosion. 140 acres were put aside for timber. In 1958, Bromfield’s children sold the farm to a conservation foundation—Friends of the Land. In August 1972, the deed of Malabar Farm was accepted by the state of Ohio after the Louis Bromfield Malabar Farm Foundation—which had been operating the farm—faced foreclosure. In 1976, the farm became a state park. On April 4, 1993 a fire burned the main barn to the ground. In September, 1994, 150 volunteers from the Timber Framers Guild of North America raised a new barn in resemblance of the original.|$|E

40|$|<b>Conservation</b> <b>farming</b> {{offers a}} package of {{improved}} agronomic practices – including early land preparation, early planting, early weeding, careful field measurement and precision input application – that enable resource-poor farmers to raise productivity through improved farm management. • Zambia’s cotton farmers own fewer cattle and earn only about 25 % as much nonfarm income as non-cotton farmers, thus limiting their ability to hire labour and purchase cash inputs. • This paper evaluates a series of <b>conservation</b> <b>farming</b> technology packages as possible vehicles for incrementally raising productivity and incomes among asset-poor farm households in Zambia’s cotton zone, where a majority of farm families till with a hand hoe and where <b>conservation</b> <b>farming</b> is most well established and best suited agronomically. • The results suggest that <b>conservation</b> <b>farming</b> can increase crop income by 140 % among the poorest smallholder cotton farmers, with no access to cash inputs...|$|E

40|$|This study {{builds on}} an earlier {{research}} done by the researchers in Chivi south district {{on the impact of}} <b>conservation</b> <b>farming</b> on food security. The major focus of this study however is on the conflicts and contradictions embedded in <b>conservation</b> <b>farming</b> owing to differential perceptions and life-worlds and implications thereof on sustainable agriculture. It contends that these diverging and conflicting life-words are counter-productive and inimical to the goal of sustainable development in general and sustainable agriculture in particular. The treatise argues that unless and until an interface analysis is implemented to try and sever the impasse, <b>conservation</b> <b>farming</b> just like the preceding farming intervention programs proffered by the state and non-state state actors as the panacea to the incessant food insecurity quagmires bedeviling perennially drought prone regions, will be rendered obsolete. Findings in this study reveal that the <b>conservation</b> <b>farming</b> project is shrouded in perpetual conflicts and struggles pitting several stakeholders involved in the program. The study was grounded in qualitative methodology and adopted unstructured interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs) and expert interviews as the main data gathering techniques. Norman Long's Actor Oriented Approach (AOA) was the theoretical lens used in the research as the major analytical framework to understand and bridge the impasse for <b>conservation</b> <b>farming</b> to have meaning to the stakeholders and leave up to its hype in rural development...|$|E
