A comparison between any two elements may be performed algorithmically by searching for the lowest common ancestor of the corresponding two leaves; if that ancestor is a parallel composition, the two elements are incomparable, and otherwise the order of the series composition operands determines the order of the elements.

As in Cole's technique, they use a desynchronized parametric search, in which each separate thread of execution of the simulated parallel sorting algorithm is allowed to progress until it needs to determine the result of another comparison, and in which the number of unresolved comparisons is halved by finding the median <b>comparison</b> <b>value</b> and calling the decision algorithm with that value. As they show, the resulting randomized parametric search algorithm makes only a logarithmic number of calls to the decision algorithm with high probability, matching Cole's theoretical analysis. An extended version of their paper includes experimental results from an implementation of the algorithm, which show that the total running time of this method on several natural geometric optimization problems {{is similar to that}} of the best synchronized parametric search implementation (the quicksort-based method of van Oostrum and Veltkamp): a little faster on some problems and a little slower on some others. However, the number of calls that it makes to the decision algorithm is significantly smaller, so this method would obtain greater benefits in applications of parametric searching where the decision algorithm is slower.|$|E
5000|$|... further {{optimized}} the parametric search {{technique for}} cases (such as the example) {{in which the}} test algorithm is a comparison sorting algorithm. For the AKS sorting network and some other sorting algorithms {{that can be used}} in its place, Cole observes that it is not necessary to keep the simulated processors synchronized with each other: instead, one can allow some of them to progress farther through the sorting algorithm while others wait for the results of their comparisons to be determined. Based on this principle, Cole modifies the simulation of the sorting algorithm, so that it maintains a collection of unresolved simulated comparisons that may not all come from the same parallel time step of the test algorithm. As in the synchronized parallel version of parametric search, it is possible to resolve half of these comparisons by finding the median <b>comparison</b> <b>value</b> and calling the decision algorithm on this value. Then, instead of repeating this halving procedure until the collection of unresolved comparisons becomes empty, Cole allows the processors that were waiting on the resolved comparisons to advance through the simulation until they reach another comparison that must be resolved.Using this method, Cole shows that a parametric search algorithm in which the test algorithm is sorting may be completed using only a logarithmic number of calls to the decision algorithm, instead of the [...] calls made by Megiddo's original version of parametric search. Instead of using the AKS sorting network, it is also possible to combine this technique with a parallel merge sort algorithm of , resulting in time bounds with smaller constant factors that, however, are still not small enough to be practical. A similar speedup can be obtained for any problem that can be computed on a distributed computing network of bounded degree (as the AKS sorting network is), either by Cole's technique or by a related technique of simulating multiple computation paths [...]|$|E

Proportional <b>comparison</b> <b>value</b> is a number that indicates the ratio high-rise unit towards the rights over mutual parts, mutual objects and mutual land, calculated based on total area and value of the concerned high-rise unit towards the building total area or the high-rise overall value at the first time the developer calculates its overall development cost to determine its selling price. In relation to the issue of deed of separation, some problems raised as follow; firstly, its legal consequences if there is changes on building plan in further stage during the high-rise development which results in changes on proportional <b>comparison</b> <b>value</b> of the Deed of High-Rise Separation, and secondly, whether strata unit and Strata title / Building title can be used as credit security and how is the implementation of partial revocation mortgage in high-rise construction credit. A research is designed as normative legal research in order to respond those problems by using 2 types of approaches that consists of: The Statue Approach and The Legal Content Analitical Approach. The legal materials analyzed herein are primary legal material and secondary legal material, arranged descriptively and systematically. Research shows that it is possible for the high-rise developer to change the building plan provided that before making any changes on the building plan, it must inform such changes to the Association of High-Rise Residents and also has received approval from the Association of High-Rise Residents, especially if such changes result in changes of the high-rise <b>comparison</b> <b>value.</b> High-rise and high-rise unit can also be used as debt security through Mortgage/Fiduciary Institution, which allows the developer to pledge the high-rise for construction credit, in which the high-rise unit that has been fully paid by its owner can be released from the credit security of high-rise construction, thus the high-rise owner may then transfer their high-rise unit for credit security of apartment ownership (KPA) as well as other financing credit security. </span...|$|E

One of the ways to control {{production}} costs is applying production standard costs that comparing the realization to production costs standard. So, it can be know the difference among the reality with the standardized production costs, in the form of profitable or lost difference. The purposed to be attained in this research is to review the production cost control conducted by the company and to know how far the company performing production control {{in order to be}} effective and efficient. Research design used is case study. Research is done in Saradan Forestry Department of Madiun. Data used in this research is secondary data in the form of data issued by the company for management party in period of 2005 - 2007. Its data collecting technique is documentation and the collected data are production cost data and organization structure. The collected data are analyzed by assessing company’s effectiveness level, efficiency level and by analyzing company’s overhead cost difference. From the research results, it can be known that production volume effectiveness for period of 2005 is 14. 270 m 3 in the budgeted production with the actual production is 15. 922 and 112 % in <b>comparison</b> <b>value.</b> For 2006, it is 16. 157 m 3 in the budgeted production, while its actual production is 17. 427 and 108 % in <b>comparison</b> <b>value.</b> And for 2007, it is 18. 954 m 3 in the budgeted production, with its actual production is 19. 486 and 103 % in <b>comparison</b> <b>value.</b> It means that the company has been effective, where the actual production has met the budgeted production target. From the cost efficiency, it seems that the actual production cost for period 2005 - 2006 is still below the budgeted production costs. In 2005, the actual cost is 98 % from production cost budget and 98. 3 in 2006. It means that company has efficient. If production cost is too high hence cost of good sold will also high. Last, in company’s volume/capacity difference is occurred profitable BOP difference where there is capacity difference in 2005 as much as Rp. 63. 732. 198, Rp. 27. 789. 963 in 2006 and Rp. 6. 750. 989 in 2007. Thus, it can be said that the company’s standardized capacity need a higher cost tariffs than the standardized capacity cost. Thus, it can be suggested that company should improves its control in each works and it needs a good coordination among each division in its job authority and assignment according to the existing organization chart. Thereby, it can be created a better work circumstance and harmonious to support all policy and the established goal...|$|E
