40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{critical}} analysis of the discourse of the Dansk Folkeparti. Through this we will be investigating the relationship that discourse has with the mainstream political discourse of their allies in government Venstre. Understanding {{their relationship with the}} party that controls the government in Denmark will guide us in identifying a hegemonic discourse of nationalism in Denmark. Relating that to the context of our globalized society we will investigate how these ideologies address and hope to confront global problems. We will also be investigating which issues are problematized. Through the theories of Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu we hope to understand the structures of power the discourse of Dansk Folkeparti reinforce with their nationalist ideology and what influence that ideology has had on contributing to a nationalist hegemonic discourse in Denmark. Posing this problem over the background of a “world risk society” we see how nationalism poses a threat to global cooperation and global democracy (Beck 2002). We also see how risks are exploited to insight fear around issues problematized by parties who <b>conveniently</b> <b>position</b> themselves as the only players in the field equipped to solve them, further strengthening their position of power and dominance...|$|R

5000|$|The station's {{location}} {{was an important}} consideration for the Brigade when first established. The building now sits in a quiet suburban area, but when built was {{in close proximity to}} some of Gympie's largest mine headworks, and was <b>conveniently</b> <b>positioned</b> between the CBD and the One Mile and Monkland mining areas. In 1904 there were 1723 miners employed in Gympie. Accident data from the Department of Mines from the early 1900s amply demonstrates the range of occupational hazards (including defective explosives, rockfalls and machinery accidents) which led to injury or death for men working in Gympie's gold mines. In the period where the ambulance station attended to mining related cases there were 37 mining deaths and numerous accidents on the Gympie goldfield. The Gympie brigade used a special [...] "Scott Tracy" [...] stretcher, fitted with leather straps to vertically raise miners from underground.

5000|$|At {{the start}} of the 1870s, however, the growing trade and {{industry}} in Glasgow resulted in the Clyde Navigation Trustees needing additional space for shipping quays in Glasgow. They used their statutory powers to compulsorily purchase the area occupied by the Clyde Bank Iron Shipyard in Govan, which belonged to J & G Thomson. Forced to find another site for their shipyard, J & G Thomson looked at various sites further down the River Clyde, and eventually purchased, from the estates of Miss Hamilton of Cochno, some suitably flat land on the [...] "West Barns o'Clyde" [...] on the north bank of the river, opposite the point where the River Cart flows into the River Clyde.

25|$|Porous bass trap {{absorbers}} {{need to be}} {{very thick}} to be effective at lower frequencies so they tend to be allocated either as diagonal wedges in the corners or as thick rectangular bulk behind false walls where they are {{out of the way and}} less likely to disrupt higher frequencies or room function. Air gap behind a porous panel absorber e.g. straddling a corner also helps to ensure it protrudes more into the room where there is more air velocity, improving its velocity-based absorption and extending its bandwidth while inducing some ripple in its absorption spectrum. Resonant bass trap absorbers need to be at a pressure maximum and tend to be thinner, so they are more <b>conveniently</b> and effectively <b>positioned</b> flat against a wall in a corner where the pressure is maximum, rather than straddling a corner where there is more velocity.|$|R
5000|$|The biggest {{advantage}} of recombineering {{is that it}} obviates the need for <b>conveniently</b> <b>positioned</b> restriction sites, whereas in conventional genetic engineering, DNA modification is often compromised by the availability of unique restriction sites. In engineering large constructs of >100 kb, such as the Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs), or chromosomes, recombineering has become a necessity. Recombineering can generate the desired modifications without leaving any 'footprints' behind. It also forgoes multiple cloning stages for generating intermediate vectors and therefore is used to modify DNA constructs {{in a relatively short}} time-frame. The homology required is short enough that it can be generated in synthetic oligonucleotides and recombination with short oligonucleotides themselves is incredibly efficient. Recently, recombineering has been developed for high throughput DNA engineering applications termed 'recombineering pipelines'. Recombineering pipelines support the large scale production of BAC transgenes and gene targeting constructs for functional genomics programs such as EUCOMM (European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Consortium) and KOMP (Knock-Out Mouse Program). Recombineering has also been automated, a process called [...] "MAGE" [...] -Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering, in the Church lab. With the development of CRISPR technologies, construction of CRISPR interference strains in E. coli requires only one-step oligo recombineering, providing a simple and easy-to-implement tool for gene expression control.|$|E

25|$|On August 14, 1959, {{the first}} league meeting {{was held in}} Chicago, and charter {{memberships}} were given to Dallas, New York, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis-Saint Paul. On August 22 the league officially was named the American Football League {{at a meeting in}} Dallas. The NFL's initial reaction was not as openly hostile as it had been with the earlier All-America Football Conference (Bell had even given his public approval), yet individual NFL owners soon began a campaign to undermine the new league. AFL owners were approached with promises of new NFL franchises or ownership stakes in existing ones. Only the party from Minneapolis accepted, and the Minnesota group joined the NFL the next year in 1961; the Minneapolis group were joined by Ole Haugsrud and Bernie Ridder in the new NFL team's ownership group, which was named the Minnesota Vikings. The older league also announced on August 29 that it had <b>conveniently</b> reversed its <b>position</b> against expansion, and planned to bring NFL expansion teams to Houston and Dallas, to start play in 1961. (The NFL did not expand to Houston at that time, the promised Dallas team – the Dallas Cowboys – actually started play in 1960, and the Vikings began play in 1961.) Finally, the NFL quickly came to terms with the Bidwills and allowed them to relocate the struggling Cardinals to St. Louis, eliminating that city as a potential AFL market.|$|R
30|$|Both in the British period (1757 - 1947) {{and in the}} Pakistan period (1947 - 1971), the {{education}} system of the nation remained a contested space of uneven yet firm political interest.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} guiding a mobile robot in the 3 -dimensional world using a set of known targets <b>conveniently</b> <b>positioned</b> at each of its docking stations. A sequence of images is acquired along the way from one station to another. Each image in the sequence is processed and motion clues are extracted to correct the E-dimensional position and orientation of the robot caused by motion slip and inaccuracy in the mechanical assembly and platform holding the robot. Using the rigidity of the target {{with respect to a}} fixed coordinate system, we expressed a set of equations from which a unique solution to the camera pose is determined. Since the camera is rigidly fixed with respect to the mobile robot, the error in a preplanned trajectory is readily known. Tests of this solution on synthetic data are presented showing that the analytic method is very accurate. The only sources of errors presently experienced in this system are those occurring during image processing operations necessary for the extraction of the image target. These errors are directly related to the maximum size of the image in the vision system as well as the target geometry...|$|E
40|$|Winds of cool dwarfs are {{difficult}} to observe, {{with only a few}} M dwarfs presenting observationally-derived mass-loss rates (Mdot), which span several orders of magnitude. Close-in exoplanets are <b>conveniently</b> <b>positioned</b> in the inner regions of stellar winds and can, thus, be used to probe the otherwise-unobservable local properties of their host-stars' winds. Here, we use local stellar wind characteristics observationally-derived in the studies of atmospheric evaporation of the warm-neptune GJ 436 b to derive the global characteristics of the wind of its M-dwarf host. Using an isothermal wind model, we constrain the stellar wind temperature to be in the range [0. 36, 0. 43] MK, with Mdot=[0. 5, 2. 5] x 10 ^{- 15 } Msyn/yr. By computing the pressure balance between the stellar wind and the interstellar medium, we derive the size of the astrophere of GJ 436 to be around 25 au, significantly more compact than the heliosphere. We demonstrate in this paper that transmission spectroscopy, coupled to planetary atmospheric evaporation and stellar wind models, can be a useful tool for constraining the large-scale wind structure of planet-hosting stars. Extending our approach to future planetary systems discoveries will open new perspectives for the combined characterisation of planetary exospheres and winds of cool dwarf stars.

40|$|The tropoelastin monomer {{undergoes}} {{stages of}} association by coacervation, deposition onto microfibrils, and cross-linking to form elastic fibers. Tropoelastin {{consists of an}} elastic N-terminal coil region and a cell-interactive C-terminal foot region linked together by a highly exposed bridge region. The bridge region is <b>conveniently</b> <b>positioned</b> to modulate elastic fiber assembly through association by coacervation and its proximity to dominant cross-linking domains. Tropoelastin constructs that either modify or remove the entire bridge and downstream regions were assessed for elastogenesis. These constructs focused on a single alanine substitution (R 515 A) and a truncation (M 155 n) at the highly conserved arginine 515 site that borders the bridge. Each form displayed less efficient coacervation, impaired hydrogel formation, and decreased dermal fibroblast attachment compared to wild-type tropoelastin. The R 515 A mutant protein additionally showed reduced elastic fiber formation upon addition to human retinal pigmented epithelium cells and dermal fibroblasts. The small-angle X-ray scattering nanostructure of the R 515 A mutant protein revealed greater conformational flexibility around the bridge and C-terminal regions. This increased flexibility of the R 515 A mutant suggests that the tropoelastin R 515 residue stabilizes {{the structure of the}} bridge region, which is critical for elastic fiber assembly...|$|E
40|$|Small {{vertebrate}} {{model organisms}} have recently gained popularity as attractive experimental models that enhance {{our understanding of}} human tissue and organ development. Despite {{a large body of}} evidence using optical spectroscopy for the characterization of small model organism on chip-based devices, no attempts have been so far made to interface microfabricated technologies with environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Conventional scanning electron microscopy requires high vacuum environments and biological samples must be, therefore, submitted to many preparative procedures to dehydrate, fix, and subsequently stain the sample with gold-palladium deposition. This process is inherently low-throughput and can introduce many analytical artifacts. This work describes a proof-of-concept microfluidic chip-based system for immobilizing zebrafish larvae for ESEM imaging that is performed in a gaseous atmosphere, under low vacuum mode and without any need for sample staining protocols. The microfabricated technology provides a user-friendly and simple interface to perform ESEM imaging on zebrafish larvae. Presented lab-on-a-chip device was fabricated using a high-speed infrared laser micromachining in a biocompatible poly(methyl methacrylate) thermoplastic. It consisted of a reservoir with multiple semispherical microwells designed to hold the yolk of dechorionated zebrafish larvae. Immobilization of the larvae was achieved by a gentle suction generated during blotting of the medium. Trapping region allowed for multiple specimens to be <b>conveniently</b> <b>positioned</b> on the chip-based device within few minutes for ESEM imaging...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} gene {{cartridges}} containing a novel synthetic promoter (P(syn)) was constructed. The P(syn) sequence {{is based on}} the consensus of a number of naturally occurring promoters and displays strong activity in Eschericihia coli and Rhizobium legunuminosarum. In a direct comparison, P(syn) proved to be about twice as strong as the tac promoter in E. coli, while the difference in Rhixobium was about tenfold. A small P(syn) cartridge was constructed by adding a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, an ATG codon, and a removable lac operator, whose excision can convert the regulated cartridge into a constitutively expressed unit. A second cassette was obtained by the addition of a lacI(q) gene in order to provide autonomous regulation also in hosts lacking lacI functions, such as R. leguminosarum. A promoterless lacZ gene was inserted to monitor the activity. This gene can be either replaced with genes of interest, or used for gene fusions by means of <b>conveniently</b> <b>positioned</b> restriction sites. A third cassette was generated by adding a mercury-resistance determinant as a selectable marker, suitable for monitoring tagged bacteria released into environments. In such cases, where a non-antibiotic-resistant marker is preferrable, the use of mercury chloride adds the advantage of inhibiting fungal growth when plating soil suspensions. The presence of the second marker, lacZ driven by the strong P(syn) facilitates the selection. Furthermore, the P(syn) fragment {{can be used as a}} specific probe for the detection of released bacteria engineered with any of the above constructs...|$|E
40|$|Super-hydrophobic (SH) {{surfaces}} are bio-inspired, nanotechnology artifacts which feature a reduced friction coefficient whereby {{they can be}} used for a number of very practical applications including, on the medical side, the manipulation of biological solutions. These surfaces can be combined with bio-photonic devices to obtain an integrated lab-on-a-chip system where, on a first stage, the SH surface would vehicle or transport the analytes of interest into a small area and, on a second stage, the bio-sensors would permit, in that area, the detection of the solute with the resolution of a single molecule. This novel diagnostic modality offers realistic possibilities for the early detection of cancers. Nevertheless, as it stands, the device still suffers from the severe disadvantage that the exact final position of the solute, upon evaporation, is unpredictable, and thus the localization and recognition of few molecules would be impractical. Conventional SH surfaces typically comprise micro pillars combined to form a regular hexagonal motif. Here, the periodicity of those pillars was broken introducing artificial gradients of wettability over the surface. In doing so, some regions are rendered more hydrophilic than others and, on account of this, a solute would preferentially target these hydrophilic regions upon evaporation. In this work, such non regular geometries were realized and used to condense diluted Rhodamine solutions in a small area. Randomly distributed silver nano aggregates, <b>conveniently</b> <b>positioned</b> upon the micropillars, permitted the identification of few molecules using enhanced Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|The {{heterogeneity}} of multiprocessor systems on chip (MPSoC) has presented unique opportunities for furthering today’s diverse application needs. FPGA-based MPSoCs {{have the potential}} of bridging the gap between generality and specialization but has traditionally been limited to device experts. The flexibility of these systems can enable computation without compromise but can only be realized if this flexibility extends throughout the software stack. At {{the top of this}} stack, there has been significant effort for leveraging the {{heterogeneity of}} the architecture. However, the betterment of these abstractions are limited to what the bottom of the stack exposes: the runtime system. The runtime system is <b>conveniently</b> <b>positioned</b> between the heterogeneity of the hardware, and the diverse mix of both programming languages and applications. As a result, it is an important enabler of realizing the flexibility of an FPGA-base MPSoC. The runtime system can provide the abstractions of how {{to make use of the}} hardware. However, it is also important to know when and which hardware to use. This is a non-issue for a homogeneous system, but is an important challenge to overcome for heterogeneous systems. This thesis presents a self-aware runtime system that is able to adapt to the application’s hardware needs with a runtime overhead that is comparable to a naive approach. It achieves this through a combination of pre-generated offline data, and the utilization of runtime data. For systems with diminishing hardware, the results confirmed that the runtime system provided high resource efficiency. This thesis also explored different runtime metrics that can affect the application on a heterogeneous system and offers concluding remarks on future work...|$|E
40|$|Ground-based {{proximal}} sensing of vineyard features {{is gaining}} interest {{due to its}} ability to serve in even quite small plots with {{the advantage of being}} conducted concurrently with normal vineyard practices (i. e., spraying, pruning or soil tilling) with no dependence upon weather conditions, external services or law-imposed limitations. The purpose of the present work was to test performance of the new terrestrial multi-sensor MECS-VINE® in terms of reliability and degree of correlation with several canopy growth and yield parameters in the grapevine. MECS-VINE®, once <b>conveniently</b> <b>positioned</b> in front of the tractor, can provide simultaneous assessment of growth features and microclimate of specific canopy sections of the two adjacent row sides. MECS-VINE® integrates a series of microclimate sensors (air relative humidity, air and surface temperature) with two (left and right) matrix-based optical RGB imaging sensors and a related algorithm, termed Canoyct). MECS-VINE® was run five times along the season in a mature cv. Barbera vineyard and a Canopy Index (CI, pure number varying from 0 to 1000), calculated through its built-in algorithm, validated vs. canopy structure parameters (i. e., leaf layer number, fractions of canopy gaps and interior leaves) derived from point quadrat analysis. Results showed that CI was highly correlated vs. any canopy parameter at any date, although the closest relationships were found for CI vs. fraction of canopy gaps (R 2 = 0. 97) and leaf layer number (R 2 = 0. 97) for data pooled over 24 test vines. While correlations against canopy light interception and total lateral leaf area were still unsatisfactory, a good correlation was found vs. cluster and berry weight (R 2 = 0. 76 and 0. 71, respectively) suggesting a good potential also for yield estimates. Besides the quite satisfactory calibration provided, main improvements of MECS-VINE® usage versus other current equipment are: (i) MECS-VINE® delivers a segmented evaluation of the canopy up to 15 different sectors, therefore allowing to differentiate canopy structure and density at specific and crucial canopy segments (i. e., basal part where clusters are located) and (ii) the sensor is optimized to work at any time of the day with any weather condition without the need of any supplemental lighting system...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} on the Turkish-speaking community, {{comprising}} Turkish-Cypriots, Turks from Turkey, and Kurds from Turkey, and ethnic community football in London, which has been conceptualised as a transnational social field. It is intended as a contribution in the debates on the growing importance of issues of diasporic communities, their identity politics, and cultural integration {{in a context of}} ‘super-diversity’. There are three major analytical themes. The first is transnational diaspora politics, which is redefined to comprise any relationship of power or interest by mobilising diasporic connections. I argue that the Turkish-speaking community uses ethnic football as a means for communal mobilisation around and representation of their ethnic identity in the public space of London, a city of unique political-economic and symbolic significance for the Cyprus Conflict which helped create the Turkish and Greek Cypriot football leagues in London. I show that the Turkish-speaking community has ever since used football to create and maintain a bridge between London and all the different locations of the community including Cyprus, Turkey, Germany, and beyond. The second major theme is collective identities and how they are (re) produced, represented, and manifested in the diaspora. I argue that the nature of the field of ethnic football as a familiar, open, and welcoming space <b>conveniently</b> <b>positioned</b> between the Turkish-speaking private sphere and the British/Londoner public space has been a major factor accounting for the effectiveness of various identity projects to be pursued within this field. Lastly, after presenting the historical link between modern competitive sports and masculinity, I claim that the one defining aspect of all the ethnic identities reproduced within the field is their masculine character. The last analytical theme is the cultural integration of immigrant communities. Without adopting a normative definition of cultural integration, I have considered the implications of involvement in ethnic community football in terms of belonging, social inclusion, marginalisation, and the psychological development and well-being of the individuals involved. The presented and analysed discussion rejects any automatic causal link between involvement in sports and integration or that involvement in mono-ethnic sporting organisations and segregation. Having reviewed a few exemplary organisations, which used football for integration purposes, {{and the nature of the}} ethnic community leagues, I have also argued in this thesis that the field of ethnic community football, again due to its specific nature, structure, and position between the private and public spaces, offers a great potential to be engaged by local and national governments in the service of integration policies.
