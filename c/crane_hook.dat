40|$|Tower cranes enjoy a long useful working life. Therefore, a vast {{population}} of cranes {{are still in}} use today that do not feature the advanced automation and sensor technologies such as those with which {{some of the new}} models are equipped. This paper examines the technological and economic feasibility of retrofitting existing tower cranes with semi-automatic devices for motion control. The proposed improvements are intended to enhance the cranes'efficiency and their capacity {{to meet the challenges of}} today's tightly scheduled construction projects. Based on work studies and analyses of craning cycles, the concept offered by the proposed improvements distinguishes between the long-distance navigation of the <b>crane's</b> <b>hook</b> and the fine maneuvering in the loading and unloading zones. The expected economic benefits resulting from the enhancement of the crane's performance, with regard to both types of motion, far exceed the cost of installing the various devices. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{strength}} of grey cast iron components subjected to combined bending and tension, this case of loading being met in C-frames and clamps, <b>crane</b> <b>hooks</b> and various eccentrically—loaded protruding machine parts. Specimens of rectangular as well as trapezoidal sections, made of flake graphite cast iron, were tested under conditions of eccentric loading. With due consideration of non-linearities and inequalities in stress-strain relations in tension and compression, stress distribution for these sections was obtained from strain measurements. The ratio of bending to tensile stress components is herein shown to {{play a significant role}} in locating the neutral plane and in identifying the dominating failure stress. The value 2, for this ratio, is shown to draw some demarkation border between the two modes of fracture encountered in the tests. The apparent superiority of bending strength over tensile strength is herein attributed to the widely differing stress-strain relations in tension and compression...|$|R
5000|$|The camera ran on {{a ceiling}} {{track in the}} hotel room and when it came outside the window, was meant to be picked up by a hook {{suspended}} from a giant crane nearly 30 metres high. A system of gyroscopes was fitted on the camera to steady it during the switch from this smooth indoor track to the crane outside. Meanwhile, the bars on the window had been given hinges. When the camera reached the window and the bars were no longer in the field of view, they were swung away to either side. At this time the camera's forward movement had to stop for a few seconds as the <b>crane's</b> <b>hook</b> grabbed it and took over from the track. To hide this, the lens was slowly and smoothly zoomed until the crane could pull the camera forward. Antonioni directed the scene from a van by means of monitors and microphones, talking to assistants who communicated his instructions to the actors and operators.|$|R

5000|$|At 0609 hours, the Stena Welder {{diving bell}} entered the water {{carrying}} rescue divers Phil Kasey-Smith and Eddy Frank. Due to communication problems, {{failure of the}} lights on the Stena Welder bell, the absence of the Wildrake bells transponder, {{and the fact that the}} Wildrake crew had forgotten they had moved the bell away from the SALM base a few hours earlier, it took Kasey-Smith nearly an hour to find the Wildrake bell on the seafloor. At 0755 hours, he saw Walker and Guiel giving him thumbs up through the porthole. Kasey-Smith spent another hour directing the recovery of the slack guide wire around the SALM base. Because the Stena Welder was not a dynamic positioning (DP) vessel, it could not be held in a constant position, causing the Stena Welder bell to drag Kasey-Smith around the seabed on his umbilical. At 0902 hours, Kasey-Smith attached the guide wire to the bell. The Wildrake began lowering its <b>crane</b> <b>hook,</b> but Kasey-Smith now saw that Walker and Guiels movements had become [...] "very very frantic". The <b>crane</b> <b>hook</b> came down too far from the bell for Kasey-Smith to reach it with the wire slings attached to the hook. The hook was raised, had further slings attached, and was sent down again to Kasey-Smith, who attached the slings to the Wildrake bell at 1010 hours.|$|E

50|$|The diving vessel Stena Welder came {{alongside}} the Wildrake to render {{assistance in the}} rescue, but its diving system was undergoing repairs {{and had to be}} hastily readied for diving. Rather than having the Stena Welder recover the bell with its own crane, Holmes and Brian Masterson elected to raise the bell with the Wildrakes crane. This necessitated that the Stena Welder rescue divers attach a guide wire to the bell, which would then be used to send the Wildrake <b>crane</b> <b>hook</b> to the bell, allowing the rescue diver to attach it to the bell with a wire sling.|$|E

50|$|The {{station was}} powered by three Caterpillar Diesel Generator sets. One ran {{at all times}} {{providing}} power for the station. Multiple storage tanks were situated around the station to hold fuel for these generators. On a lower level from the station was a boat house and a crane engine building. The crane was operated by another Caterpillar engine. The island had no landing place with sheer cliffs rising on all sides. To get on or off the island, other than by helicopter, the <b>crane</b> was <b>hooked</b> up to a sixteen-foot fiberglass boat with an outboard engine, The men would climb into the boat and be swung by the crane {{over the edge of}} the island and dropped the sixty feet to the water. To get back on the boat had to be maneuvered under the hook at the base of the cliff, attached and lifted back up. Needless to say this was not any easy feat and was seldom done in rough weather. Resupply was accomplished the same way, hoisting cargo nets of supplies up onto the boathouse deck.|$|R

50|$|When {{flying from}} a warship, the Walrus would be {{recovered}} by touching-down alongside, then {{lifted from the}} sea by a ship's crane. The aircraft's lifting-gear was kept in a compartment in the section of wing directly above the engine - one of the Walrus' crew would climb onto the top wing and attach this to the <b>crane</b> <b>hook.</b> Landing and recovery was a straightforward procedure in calm waters, but could be very difficult if the conditions were rough. The usual procedure was for the parent ship to turn through around 20° just before the aircraft touched down, thus creating a 'slick' to the lee side of ship on which the Walrus could alight, this being followed by a fast taxi up to the ship before the 'slick' dissipated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Boom or tower type <b>crane</b> consist <b>hook</b> {{facility}} to lift or move material {{and it is}} more flexibility than simple beam type horizontally established gantry crane. In this crane, beam is lifted by means of wire rope, link or chain to the distal end of boom and material can be lift by means of wire rope with lifting point. Beam is directly suspended using wire ropes and its move by boom crane. Wire ropes are fitted with lugs which are directly welded to the horizontally suspended beam for lifting material or objects. Generally, Beams are used to move slender materials specifically say slender plate as one industry application. Slender plate type objects are flexible in nature so, it may be sag or bend {{during a time of}} lifting because of only two lifting lug are generally used. Moreover, fixed size of beam is used for a single application of lifting plate so; this is a limitation of a beam, and in major cases it requires changing as application changes. On the other hand, due to two lifting point on a beam plate may be band or sag so it’s require to solve two problem simultaneously. Also it is not solution to simply weld more number of lifting points say lug to beam, but need of specific and optimum design is requirement which is detail describe in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This {{probabilistic}} {{analysis of}} WIPP TRUDOCK crane failure {{is based on}} two sources of failure data. The source for operator errors is the report by Swain and Guttman, NUREG/CR- 1278 -F, August 1983. The source for <b>crane</b> cable <b>hook</b> breaks was initially made by WIPP/WID- 96 - 2196, Rev. O by using relatively old (1970 s) U. S. Navy data (NUREG- 0612). However, a helpful analysis by R. K. Deremer of PLG guided the authors to values that were more realistic and more conservative, with the recommendation that the crane cable/hook failure rate should be 2. 5 x 10 - 6 per demand. This value was adopted and used. Based on these choices a mean failure rate of 9. 70 x 10 - 3 (1 /yr) was calculated. However, a mean rate by itself does not reveal the level of confidence {{to be associated with}} this number. Guidance to making confidence calculations came from the report by Swain and Guttman, who stated that failure data could be described by lognormal distributions. This is in agreement with the widely use d reports (by DOE and others) NPRD- 95 and NPRD- 91, on failure data. The calculations of confidence levels showed that the mean failure rate of 9. 70 x 10 - 3 (1 /yr) corresponded to a percentile value of approximately 71; i. e. there is a 71 % likelihood that the failure rate is less than 9. 70 x 10 - 3 (1 /yr). One also calculated that there is a 95 % likelihood that the failure rate is less than 29. 6 x 10 - 3 (1 /yr). Or, as stated previously, there is a 71 % likelihood that not more than one dropped load will occur in 103 years. Also, there is a 95 % likelihood that not more than one dropped load will occur in approximately 34 years. It is the responsibility of DOE to select the confidence level at which it desires to operate...|$|R
