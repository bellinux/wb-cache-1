40|$|Diagonal bracing is {{a common}} method used in South Africa for the bracing of timber trussed roofs with spans of less than 9 m.

Some of the stiffness of the bracing is lost because the low torsional rigidity of the top chord as well as the batten to top chord nailing is all part of the structural system. In this paper the authors investigate bracing of the entire roof system and contend that it is better to connect the bracing member closer to the battens as this improves the stiffness and bracing ability of the system. The authors study both the diagonal brace as well as the alternative bracing method that uses criss-cross metal strapping, sometimes called speed brace. The speed brace is nailed to the top of the <b>compression</b> <b>chord</b> and is therefore much closer to the battens. Two different truss spans were studied to ascertain the buckling length of the top chord for both the diagonal bracing as well as speed bracing.

40|$|In South Africa, timber-trussed roofs {{supporting}} concrete tiles {{have for}} many years often been braced solely by means of diagonal braces. Failures {{have shown that the}} diagonal brace was inadequate for larger span roofs, and the use of diagonal bracing has subsequently been limited to spans of less or equal to 10 m. When designing the <b>compression</b> <b>chords</b> of a timber truss in a braced roof, SANS 10163 : 1 (2003) recommends a minimum effective length for out-of-plane buckling of not less than 15 x b, which is 540 mm for a 36 mm wide member. This effective or out-of-plane buckling length of the top chord was later assumed to be equal to the spacing of the trusses. With the availability of PC-based packages that are able to perform three-dimensional buckling analyses, it is perhaps useful to investigate the validity of using the effective length equal to the truss spacing, and then also the 10 m limit on span for roofs braced by means of diagonal braces. A common error made when analysing three-dimensional buckling problems is to assume connectivity on the centreline of the members, thereby neglecting eccentricity between the centreline of the bracing and the centreline of the member being braced (see Figure 1). In timber-trussed roofs, the diagonal brace is nailed to the underside of the top chord of a number of adjacent trusses. The brace runs at more or less 45 ° and triangulation appears to be complete when viewed on plan, as the battens form the other elements of the bracing system triangulation. Trusses some distance from the trusses that are connected to the diagonal brace can, however, only obtain lateral support via the battens that are connected {{to the top of the}} <b>compression</b> <b>chords.</b> The authors feel that a more correct way of analysing a timber-trussed roof, braced by means of a diagonal brace, requires that the eccentricity between the centreline of the battens on top of the <b>compression</b> <b>chords</b> and the centreline of the braced points on the underside of the <b>compression</b> <b>chords</b> be taken into account. Furthermore, the connections between the battens and the top chord are not infinitely stiff and this stiffness, together with the low torsional rigidity of the timber members, should be taken into account in the buckling analysis. The analysis can be further improved by taking the out-of-plane bending stiffness of the web members into account. All these factors will influence the buckling length of the <b>compression</b> <b>chords</b> to some degree. In this paper, the authors show how incorrect assumptions may mislead the designer into believing that the buckling length is equal to or less than the spacing of the trusses. They also show that, even though the bracing members have been placed on the correct sides of the top chord in the analysis, incorrect assumptions about the torsional stiffness of the top chords can lead to buckling lengths that are slightly less than when a more realistic torsional stiffness is used...|$|R

The design and analysis of trusses evolved over time to its current state. Most manual truss analyses use the methods of joints and sections under idealized conditions. These ideal conditions, including pinned connections, cause discrepancies between the ideal truss being analyzed and the actual truss being constructed. The discrepancies include joint rigidity, connection eccentricity, and transverse loading. These cause secondary stresses, which induce bending moment into the truss members due to the chord’s continuity. Secondary stresses are most severe in continuous <b>compression</b> <b>chord</b> members.

This report aims to determine the variables that affect the magnitude of secondary stresses in continuous compression chords due to chord continuity. The variables considered are chord stiffness, truss depth, and chord efficiency. Pratt trusses with WT chords were analyzed using the commercial analysis software RISA 3 D. Pinned and continuous chord trusses were compared using the interaction value for each chord member. The results were used to determine how these variables affect secondary stresses and how secondary stresses can be predicted. Evaluation criteria were examined to determine the severity of secondary stresses. These criteria examine the radius of gyration, moment of inertia, depth, and section moduli of the chord members, and the moment of inertia of the truss for determination of secondary stress severity. The results of the studies show that secondary stresses increase with increasing member stiffness, decreasing member efficiency, and decreasing truss depth.

The Quebec Bridge {{was the longest}} cantilever structure attempted until that time. In its final design, the clear span was 548. 6 m (1, 800 ft) long. The bridge project was financially troubled from the beginning. This caused many setbacks {{in the design and}} construction. Construction finally began in October 1900. In August 1907, the bridge collapsed suddenly. Seventy five workers were killed in the accident, and there were only 11 survivors from the workers on the span. A distinguished panel was assembled to investigate the disaster. The panel’s report found that the main cause of the bridge’s failure was improper design of the latticing on the <b>compression</b> <b>chords.</b> The collapse was initiated by the buckling failure of Chord A 9 L, on the anchor arm near the pier, immediately followed by Chord A 9 R.

40|$|AbstractThe {{design of}} {{concrete}} members for shear without stirrups {{has become a}} major issue worldwide especially for bridge decks as the shear capacity according to the ‘new’ regulations like the Eurocode often gives significant smaller values than the one predicted by former codes. Therefore nowadays stirrups are required in bridge decks. In addition the safety of existing structures mainly build without shear reinforcement has been brought into focus. The lack of the available design models will be demonstrated by comparing the results of various codes. The inaccuracy of the EC 2 approach is checked by means of a shear database. Experimental as well as numerical studies revealed that the shear capacity of haunched beams is different from members with constant height. It is questionable whether this behavior is caused by the vertical component of the inclined <b>compression</b> <b>chord</b> Vcc...|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{the present}} work is {{intended}} to numerically formulate the truss model with an inclined <b>compression</b> <b>chord</b> shown in Fig.  1 by decoupling the beam behavior into the tied arch and the beam. The theoretical base concept for the present approach {{is based on the}} relationship between shear and bending moment in a cracked reinforced concrete beam, i.e., V = dM/dx. Utilizing some idealizations together with the recent elaborations by Collins and Mitchell (1991) and Hsu (1993), a gross compatibility condition is established and formulated between the deformation associated with the tied arch and the deformation with the web. Thereby, the beam shear resistant mechanism is decoupled into the base components. The performance of the present approach is briefly examined by a comparison with the existing experimental data and a sensitivity study. It is also shown that the theoretical results can explain in a rigorous and consistent way the experimentally observed behavior of beam failing in shear.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies, shear behaviour {{before or}} after strengthening is still not fully understood, particularly in continuous concrete structures which are the norm. Upgrading shear resistance is altogether more difficult since Externally Bonded Reinforcement (EBR) or Near Surface Mounted (NSM) techniques do not allow the FRP material to be anchored into the compression zone of the T-beams and they cannot be used {{in cases where the}} sides of the beams are inaccessible. An innovative retrofit technique, named Deep Embedment (DE) or Embedded Through Section (ETS) technique involves the insertion of FRP/steel bars upwards into vertical or inclined holes which have been drilled from the soffit of concrete beams. In this way, the tension and <b>compression</b> <b>chords</b> of the beams are directly connected while the bars are bonded to the concrete core through adhesives. With this technique strengthening can be done in cases where the webs are inaccessible. Thus the main focus {{of this study is to}} significantly contribute to the current knowledge on the behaviour of Reinforced Concrete continuous T-beams strengthened in shear using the DE technique where large shear forces are combined with large negative bending moments. An experimental program consisting of ten two-span continuous T-beams designed to fail in shear was carried out in order to significantly contribute to the current knowledge on the behaviour of RC continuous Tbeams strengthened in shear using this technique. Therefore, this paper reports on the test results and on their significance in being able to apply this technique on concrete structures by validating them through adequate analytical models...|$|R

After {{the development of the}} first branch of the critical shear crack, failure is considered to occur when the stresses at any point of the concrete <b>compression</b> <b>chord</b> reach the assumed biaxial stress failure envelope.

40|$|In {{reinforced}} concrete beams subjected to concentrated loads, the shear resisted increases considerably as the loads {{approach to the}} support. There is not a consensus in the current codes of practice about any simple design formulation which adequately considers this phenomenon. A mechanical model has been developed at the Polytechnic University of Barcelona, which predicts the shear strength of beams. The mo del is originally applicable to slender beams (a/d > 2. 0 - 2. 5), and is under consideration for adoption into the Eurocodes. The model deals with shear - flexure failure, in which flexural cracks develop inclined through the web and stabilized near the neutral axis. Failure is assumed to happen when this flexural crack develops inside the <b>compression</b> <b>chord,</b> subjected to normal and shear stresses, which takes place when the stresses reach the biaxial failure envelope of Kupfer. The model has been extended to ca ses where the loads are applied near the supports. In this case, the Bernoulli assumption (Plane sections remain plane) is no longer valid, and the problem must be faced as a typical discontinuity “D” region, because the dimensions (a/d< 2) and because the vertical stresses introduced by the vertical loads {{by means of the}} bearing plates interact with the state of stresses of the <b>compression</b> <b>chord.</b> The extension of the model proposed at UPC consists on incrementing the neutral axis depth as the load approach es the supports and including the vertical stresses due to the applied concentrated loads, as confinement stresses in the concrete, thus changing the state of principal stress in the failure envelope from tension - compression to compression - compression, thu s enhancing the shear capacity In this thesis, a data base of beams with loads near the supports, with and without stirrups, has been collected.

This study evaluated C-perpendicular to behavior of typical assemblies used in construction, in which members experience C-perpendicular to stresses near their longitudinal-end through wood-on-wood contact.

For each test assembly, paired ASTM tests of the main member (bottom chord member in BC tests, and bottom plate member in BP tests) were conducted. The assembly stresses at 1 mm deflection were always lower than the corresponding ASTM stresses at the same deflection. Due to varying assembly depths, 1 mm deflection was a poor criterion for determining C-perpendicular to stress values. For B.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Current {{compression}} perpendicular-to-grain (c-perp) {{design values}} for wood members {{are based on}} mean stress using the ASTM D 143 specimen. Base design value, as determined from 0. 04 -in deformation in the ASTM specimen, is applied to all c-perp applications. While the standard ASTM test was presumably believed to adequately reflect relevant c-perp applications {{at the time it}} was developed (likely railroad cross-ties, wall plates and similar cross-sections), the specimen has limited applicability to many of today's c-perp bearing applications. Previous work has shown that wood-on-wood c-perp bearing is a more severe case as opposed to metal-on-wood bearing. End bearing conditions have been shown to represent a more severe c-perp loading scenario as opposed to load applied over central area. Research has shown that c-perp behavior of wood members is dependant on angle of applied load to annual ring orientation and that the most severe loading case is usually at an angle between 30 and 60 degrees to direction of applied load. Past studies also suggest that depth of member affects c-perp MOE and that higher aspect ratio may lead to instability of the member. As the c-perp behavior observed in the ASTM testing procedure is that of continually increasing stress with increasing deflection and densification, c-perp is generally believed to be serviceability rather than a life safety issue. However, in engineered wood applications, c-perp bearing may occur at areas where structural cohesiveness of a member is necessary to transmit forces through fasteners, such as truss plates. In such scenarios, c-perp has the potential to be a life safety issue. A study was designed to evaluate c-perp behavior of typical as-constructed assemblies in which members experience c-perp stresses near their longitudinal end through wood-on-wood contact. The study included both finite element analysis and experimental testing. Two as-constructed assemblies were evaluated in the study. These included assembly of the bottom chord of a truss bearing on the top plate of a wall (BC assembly) and assembly of the <b>compression</b> <b>chord</b> of a shear wall bearing on the bottom plate (BP assembly) of a wall. Finite element analysis modeled wood material as a composite with alternating earlywood and latewood layers with infinite radius of curvature. BC, BP and ASTM configurations were modeled both with load applied perpendicular and parallel to annual rings. Three BC assemblies were tested. These included BC- 2 X 4, BC- 2 X 8, and BC- 2 X 12, which had nominal 2 X 4, 2 X 8, and 2 X 12 members as bottom chord members, respectively. Therefore, within BC test assemblies aspect ratio of the bottom chord members varied greatly. The three BC geometries were each tested with both Douglas-fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir top plate material. BP configuration was also tested with both Douglas-fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir bottom plate material. For each test assembly, paired ASTM tests of the main member (bottom chord member in BC tests, and bottom plate member in BP tests) were conducted. Results were analyzed utilizing a variety of statistical methods. Finite element analysis revealed that strain was more uniform throughout depth of the bottom chord member when loaded perpendicular to annual rings than when loaded parallel to annual rings. In BC tests majority of deflection was found to occur in the bottom chord member. In BP test, the majority of deflection was found to occur within the bottom plate with only minimal deflection occurring in the longitudinally loaded <b>compression</b> <b>chord.</b> Due to varying assembly depths, 0. 04 -in, deflection was found to be a poor criterion for determining c-perp stress values. In order to account for assembly depth, stress values were based on system strain. As 0. 04 -in, deflection corresponds to two percent strain in the 2 -in, deep ASTM specimen, it was determined that stress determination be based on 2 -percent system strain. Due to large settlement effects observed in the tested wood-onwood assemblies, an offset strain was adopted as the method for determining and comparing stress values across differing assemblies and configurations tested. Within BC tests, the species of top plate material was not found to significantly affect assembly performance. This was due to the overwhelming influence of bottom chord behavior on system behavior. Within BP tests there was suggestive but inconclusive evidence of a significant difference between Douglas-fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir tests. It was recommended that further BP tests be conducted with larger sample sizes in order to determine the influence of wood species on c-perp behavior of bottom plate members. Mean stress values of BC and BP assembly tests were found to be significantly lower than that of corresponding ASTM tests of the main member. This finding lends justification to the Canadian 2 / 3 reduction factor for these scenarios as well as to the design procedures suggested by German researchers. It was determined that the ASTM c-perp test does not adequately represent these bearing scenarios. Adjustment factors are recommended for wood-on-wood bearing and opposite side end bearing. Aspect ratio was found to affect c-perp failure mode and led to high potential for sudden and catastrophic failure of members. Fifteen percent of 2 X 12 members tested failed prior to NDS design stresses due to premature failure of the nominal 2 X 12 bottom chord member. It was estimated that the odds of a 2 X 1 2 failing catastrophically are at least 16 times that of a 2 X 8 failing catastrophically. It was determined that as aspect ratio increases c-perp becomes a life safety as well as a serviceability issue and an adjustment factor for aspect ratio is recommended...|$|E
