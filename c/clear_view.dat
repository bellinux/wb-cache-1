5|$|The <b>Clear</b> <b>View</b> School {{was built}} in 1917 by Frank Vanderlip on his Beechwood {{property}} as the Scarborough School, the first Montessori school in the United States. In 1978, the school closed; The <b>Clear</b> <b>View</b> School purchased the property in 1980 and opened in 1981. It runs a day treatment program for 83 students with mental disorders.|$|E

5|$|But {{he failed}} to ensure the {{fighting}} qualities of these soldiers earned them a proportionate share of recognition and honours. Further, despite claims that Chauvel alone had a <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> of the battle, that his coolness and skill were crucial in gaining the victory, his name was omitted from {{the long list of}} honours published on New Year's Day 1917. Murray did offer Chauvel a lesser award (a Distinguished Service Order) for Romani which he declined.|$|E

5|$|Following the Scarborough School's closing, the Beechwood Theater {{had stood}} empty for many years, and was {{restored}} in 1983 by the Greater Ossining Area Community Theater. On March 17, 1984, The <b>Clear</b> <b>View</b> School presented a solo performance of Currier Bell, Esquire (a dramatization of Charlotte BrontÃ«'s life) performed by Julie Harris. The performance was a $100-a-ticket {{benefit for the}} school. Also on that day, the theater was rededicated as the Julie Harris Theater. Briarcliff High School used the theater until its own was constructed in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{audience}} is seated {{in front of}} the stage, to {{the left side of the}} stage, and in the corner front-left of stage; these are in order of decreasing desirability. While the metsuke-bashira pillar obstructs the view of the stage, the actors are primarily at the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where the views of the two main actors would be obscured, ensuring a generally <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> regardless of seating.|$|E

5|$|As the Union army approached, Lee {{chose to}} make a stand at Sharpsburg, Maryland along Antietam Creek. On September 17, 1862, the armies engaged in the Battle of Antietam. The V Corps was held in reserve {{in the center of}} Union lines during the battle. The 22nd had a <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> of both flanks of the Union army and watched the assaults that took place {{over the course of the}} day. The V Corps, however, took no part in these assaults. Historians have criticized McClellan for his uncoordinated attacks at Antietam and for not {{committing}} the V Corps which might have broken Lee's army.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Vanderlip family, {{particularly}} Virginia Vanderlip Schoales, {{continued to}} administer the school for sixty years. A 1959 development plan made way for a new primary school in 1961, new science facilities in 1962, expansion of the library in 1963, {{and the creation of}} an organization for alumni, of whom there were more than a thousand living in 1977. The school was unable to obtain sufficient funding and closed in 1978. In 1980, the buildings and property were taken over by The <b>Clear</b> <b>View</b> School, which opened in September 1981 after major renovations. The school runs a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21, and is sponsored by the Association for Mentally Ill Children of Westchester; its program involves education, treatment, and crisis intervention and parent involvement.|$|E
5|$|The Nanjakana {{compound}} is {{the most}} highly elevated of the three compounds in the rova at Ambohimanga. Located to the northeast of Mahandrinoro, this compound {{is believed to have}} been first constructed by Andrianjafy in the late eighteenth century. To the north of the compound is a stone esplanade that offers a <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> of the surrounding areas where Andrianampoinimerina reportedly came to reflect on his military strategy for bringing Imerina under his control. During the 1861 funeral of Queen Ranavalona I held in the Nanjakana compound, a spark accidentally ignited a nearby barrel of gunpowder destined for use in the ceremony, causing an explosion and fire that killed a number of bystanders and destroyed three of the compound's historic royal residences.|$|E

5|$|The Scarborough Day School was {{a private}} school in Scarborough-on-Hudson, in Briarcliff Manor, New York. Frank and Narcissa Vanderlip {{established}} the school in 1913 at their estate, Beechwood. The school, a nonsectarian nonprofit college preparatory day school, taught students at pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade levels and had small class sizes, with total enrollment rarely exceeding 150 students. Since 1980, the buildings and property have been owned by The <b>Clear</b> <b>View</b> School, which runs a day treatment program for 83 students. The current school still uses the Scarborough School's theater, which was opened in 1917. The school campus is a contributing property to the Scarborough Historic District.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Dive Coaster can vary {{slightly}} from one to another. Depending on the amusement park's request, one row on the train can seat anywhere from 6 to 10 riders. Stadium seating {{is also used to}} give every rider a <b>clear</b> <b>view.</b> Next, compared to standard Bolliger & Mabillard 4 abreast cars, because of the extra weight of each car on a Dive Coaster, the size of the track must be larger than other B models (such as the Hyper Coaster) to support the weight. At the top of the primary vertical drop, a braking system holds the train for 3 to 5 seconds, giving riders a view of the drop ahead before being released into the drop.|$|E
5|$|The {{stage and}} {{associated}} props took twenty-four semi-trailer trucks to transport. The setup {{consisted of a}} main stage with three elevators and a turntable (which rose and lowered), a central runway with LED and strobe lights connected to a central stage with a LED view screen in the construction and an elevator. The two secondary runways were raised up into the stands and also had view screens inside the construction. Two projection screens were raised above the audience so those who couldn't get a <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> of the stage could still see the performance. There were also 3 LED screens that moved around during the performance, including one semicircular transparent screen lowered onto the stage during the video interludes.|$|E

5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{has been}} home {{to a number of}} schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day & Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978. Since then, The <b>Clear</b> <b>View</b> School has run a day {{treatment}} program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21 there. The Macfadden School ran from 1939 to 1950 at the William Kingsland mansion in the village.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{controversy}} and celebrity surrounding the case, the judicial duel between Carrouges and Le Gris {{was the last}} ever permitted by the French government and as such a well attended and infamous event, it soon attracted near-legendary status. In France {{the memory of the}} duel far outlasted its participants, primarily a result of it being recorded soon after by the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart. Over the following century, vivid and imaginative accounts were carried in the chronicles of Jean JuvÃ©nal des Ursins and the Grandes Chroniques de France as well as by Jehan de Waurin and others, many embellishing the story with imaginative twists. The factual details of the case are unusually well recorded for a medieval trial as the records of the Parlement de Paris have survived intact and Jacques Le Gris' lawyer Jean Le Coq kept meticulous notes on the case which still exist. In addition to a <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> of proceedings these notes also contain Le Coq's own concerns about his client, whose innocence Le Coq deemed highly suspect.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, Napoleon I of France {{arrived at}} SchÃ¶nbrunn Palace {{to play the}} Turk. According to an {{eyewitness}} report, MÃ¤lzel took responsibility {{for the construction of}} the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk (Johann Baptist Allgaier) saluted Napoleon {{before the start of the}} match. The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory. According to Bradley Ewart, it is believed that the Turk sat at its cabinet, and Napoleon sat at a separate chess table. Napoleon's table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into the Turk's area, with MÃ¤lzel crossing back and forth to make each player's move and allowing a <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> for the spectators. In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move, as was usual; but MÃ¤lzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing the move, the Turk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game. Napoleon attempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Napoleon then attempted the move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, and then played a real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender. Alternate versions of the story include Napoleon being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later time, playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a shawl around the head and body of the Turk in an attempt to obscure its vision.|$|E

5|$|Saladin besieged Tiberias in {{the eastern}} Galilee on 3 July 1187 and the Crusader army {{attempted}} to attack the Ayyubids by way of Kafr Kanna. After hearing of the Crusaders' march, Saladin led his guard back to their main camp at Kafr Sabt, leaving a small detachment at Tiberias. With a <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> of the Crusader army, Saladin ordered al-Muzaffar Umar to block the Crusaders' entry from Hattin by taking a position near Lubya, while GÃ¶kbÃ¶ri and his troops were stationed at a hill near al-Shajara. On 4 July the Crusaders advanced toward the Horns of Hattin and charged against the Muslim forces, but were overwhelmed and defeated decisively. Four days after the battle, Saladin invited al-Adil {{to join him in}} the reconquest of Palestine, Galilee and Lebanese coast. On 8 July the Crusader stronghold of Acre was captured by Saladin, while his forces seized Nazareth and Saffuriya; other brigades took Haifa, Caesarea, Sebastia and Nablus, while al-Adil conquered Mirabel and Jaffa. On 26 July, Saladin returned to the coast and received the surrender of Sarepta, Sidon, Beirut, and Jableh. In August, the Ayyubids conquered Ramla, Darum, Gaza, Bayt Jibrin, and Latrun. Ascalon was taken on 4 September. In SeptemberâOctober 1187, the Ayyubids besieged Jerusalem, taking possession of it on 2 October, after negotiations with Balian of Ibelin.|$|E
