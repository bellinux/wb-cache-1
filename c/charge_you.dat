5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a <b>charge,</b> <b>you</b> are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E

500|$|Saint-Gaudens {{wrote to}} Roosevelt later in January, [...] "Whatever I produce cannot {{be worse than}} the inanities now {{displayed}} on our coins." [...] However, Saint-Gaudens foresaw resistance from Barber, who [...] "has been in that institution since {{the foundation of the}} government, and will be found standing in its ruins". [...] In , the sculptor wrote to Roosevelt that he had sent an assistant to Washington to obtain the technical [...] details of the redesign, but [...] "if you succeed in getting the best of the polite Mr. Barber or the others in <b>charge,</b> <b>you</b> will have done a greater work than putting through the Panama Canal. [...] Nevertheless, I will stick at it, even unto death." ...|$|E
500|$|Finding the Persian fleet {{gone from}} Samos, the Allies were thrown into uncertainty. Eventually they {{resolved}} {{that they would}} sail to the mainland, and equipped themselves for a naval battle. However, when the Allies approached Mycale, the Persians {{did not attempt to}} engage them, and remained guarding their camp. Leotychides therefore sailed as close to the camp as possible, and had a herald make an appeal to the Ionians: [...] "Men of Ionia, you who hear us, understand what I say, for by no means will the Persians understand anything I <b>charge</b> <b>you</b> with when we join battle; first of all it is right for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry Hebe: and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it." [...] Herodotus suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold; firstly to encourage the Ionians, unbeknownst to the Persians, to fight for the Allies (or at least not to fight against them); or, if the message became known to the Persians, to make the Persians mistrust the Ionians.|$|E
500|$|Moffat and Vertue became {{interested}} in casting Cumberbatch as the title character after watching his performance in the 2007 film Atonement. The actor was cast after reading the script for the creative team. [...] "Cumberbatch", says The Guardian, [...] "has a reputation for playing odd, brilliant men very well, and his Holmes is cold, techie, slightly Aspergerish". Cumberbatch said, [...] "There's a great <b>charge</b> <b>you</b> get from playing him, because {{of the volume of}} words in your head and the speed of thought—you really have to make your connections incredibly fast. He is {{one step ahead of the}} audience and of anyone around him with normal intellect. They can't quite fathom where his leaps are taking him." [...] Piers Wenger, head of drama at BBC Cymru Wales, described the series' rendering of Sherlock as [...] "a dynamic superhero in a modern world, an arrogant, genius sleuth driven by a desire to prove himself cleverer than the perpetrator and the police—everyone in fact". Addressing changing social attitudes and broadcasting regulations, Cumberbatch's Holmes replaced the pipe with multiple nicotine patches. The writers believed that Sherlock should not talk like [...] "a completely modern person", says Moffat, but were initially intent that [...] "he never sounded like he's giving a lecture". Moffat turned the character [...] "more Victorian" [...] in the second series, capitalising more on Cumberbatch's [...] "beautiful voice" [...] to make it sound like [...] "he's giving a lecture".|$|E
6000|$|... "The charge which I laid at {{your door}} then, Mr. Clyffurde, {{has not been}} lifted from its {{threshold}} yet. I <b>charged</b> <b>you</b> with deliberately conspiring against my King and my country all the while that you were eating bread and salt at my table. I <b>charged</b> <b>you</b> with striving to render assistance to that Corsican usurper whom may the great God punish, and you yourself practically owned to this before you left my house." ...|$|R

The soldiers are to be punished {{as in the case}} of an irremissible crime if they offer any affront or violence to the women because, besides being offenses against God, such excesses committed by them could also bring disaster to the entire expedition.|$|E
2500|$|King is {{a public}} critic of Paul LePage, the Republican Governor of Maine, and has {{referred}} to LePage {{as one of the}} Three Stooges, along with Florida Governor Rick Scott and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. [...] He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a weekly radio address on March 18, 2015, that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the Governor's office but no apology was issued. [...] King said LePage was [...] "full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green" [...] and demanded that LePage [...] "man up and apologize". [...] LePage declined to apologize to King, stating [...] "I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. What I said was, Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said." [...] LePage further told King that he should [...] "make me the villain of your next book and I won’t <b>charge</b> <b>you</b> royalties".|$|E
2500|$|The ministers {{were all}} on hand, and ruling elder Thomas Leverett was charged with {{managing}} the examination. He called Mrs. Hutchinson and read the numerous errors with which she had been charged. [...] What followed was a nine-hour interrogation where only four of the many errors were covered. At the end, Cotton was put in the uncomfortable position of delivering the admonition to his admirer. [...] He said, [...] "I would speake it to Gods Glory [...] you have bine an Instrument of doing some good amongst us... he hath given you a sharp apprehension, a ready utterance and abilitie to exprese yourselfe in the Cause of God." [...] With this said, it was the overwhelming conclusion of the ministers that Hutchinson's unsound beliefs outweighed any good that she had done, and that she endangered the spiritual welfare of the community. [...] Cotton continued, [...] "You cannot Evade the Argument... that filthie Sinne of the Communitie of Woemen; and all promiscuous and filthie cominge togeather of men and Woemen without Distinction or Relation of Mariage, will necessarily follow.... Though I have not herd, nayther do I thinke you have bine unfaythfull to your Husband in his Marriage Covenant, yet that will follow upon it." [...] He concluded, [...] "Therefor, I doe Admonish you, and alsoe <b>charge</b> <b>you</b> {{in the name of}} Ch Je, in whose place I stand... that you would sadly consider the just hand of God agaynst you, the great hurt you have done to the Churches, the great Dishonour you have brought to Je Ch, and the Evell that you have done to many a poore soule." [...] With this, Hutchinson was instructed to return on the next lecture day in one week.|$|E
