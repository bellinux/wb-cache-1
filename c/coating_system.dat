40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effectiveness}} of innovative polymeric coatings, polyurea and polyaspartic polyurea, to protect structural steel from corrosion was investigated through standard laboratory tests. The coating evaluation tests included salt fog test, QUV weathering test, adhesion test, and freeze-thaw stability test. These tests {{were used to}} assess the long-term performance of coating technologies compared to the conventional polyurethane type coatings, i. e. <b>coating</b> <b>systems</b> with inorganic zinc primer, epoxy intermediate coat and polyurethane topcoat. This paper presents part of results in the aforementioned evaluation tests. The results illustrate that polyaspartic <b>coating</b> <b>systems</b> are very promising for corrosion mitigation and can provide long-term adhesion strength for transportation steel structures. In addition, compared with the <b>coating</b> <b>systems</b> currently used by Department of Transportation’s (DOT’s), the polyaspatic <b>coating</b> <b>systems</b> performed equally well with even higher bond strength...|$|R

5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, passive fire {{protection}} remains inactive in the <b>coating</b> <b>system</b> until a fire occurs. There are mainly two types of PFP: intumescent fire protection and vermiculite fire protection. In vermiculite fire protection, the structural steel members are covered with vermiculite materials, mostly a very thick layer. This is a cheaper option as compared to an intumescent one, but is very crude and aesthetically unpleasant. Moreover, if the environment is corrosive in nature, then the vermiculite option is not advisable, as {{there is the possibility}} of water seeping into it (because of the porous nature of vermiculite), and there it is difficult to monitor for corrosion. Intumescent fireproofing is a layer of paint which is applied along with the <b>coating</b> <b>system</b> on the structural steel members. The thickness of this intumescent coating is dependent on the steel section used. For calculation of DFT (dry film thickness) a factor called Hp/A (heated perimeter divided by cross sectional area), referred to as [...] "section factor" [...] and expressed in m−1, is used. Intumescent coatings are applied as an intermediate coat in a <b>coating</b> <b>system</b> (primer, intermediate, and top/finish coat). Because of the relatively low thickness of this intumescent coating (usually in the 350- to 700-micrometer range), nice finish, and anti-corrosive nature, intumescent coatings are preferred on the basis of aesthetics and performance.|$|E

50|$|When applied, liquid roofing systems {{encapsulate}} {{the surface}} they are applied to, preserving whatever is underneath and protecting it from weathering. This is especially desirable {{when dealing with}} asbestos roofs, as attempted removal of asbestos roofing can damage it, releasing material that can trigger asbestosis.
