40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of <b>colestipol</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> a new bile acid-sequestrant resin, on some of the parameters of cholesterol turnover and metabolism in man. Three normal volunteers and eight hyperlipidemic patients participated in three sets of cholesterol turnover studies carried out at intervals of approximately 1 yr. The effects of colestipol were assessed by comparing the results obtained before therapy with those obtained on repeat study after several months of resin therapy. Colestipol treatment significantly reduced the serum cholesterol concentration (mean reduction 21 %), and produced a large increase in the production rate of cholesterol (mean 86 %) and in the turnover rate of cholesterol in pool 1 (mean 46 %). The values of the intercompartmental rate constants and of the size of the rapidly exchangeable pool were unchanged with therapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} oral {{administration}} of the non-absorbable anion-exchange resins cholestyramine and colestipol on the systemic clearance and other pharmacokinetic parameters of intravenously administered ibuprofen (25 mg kg- 1) was studied in rabbits. Single doses of <b>colestipol</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (0. 4 g kg- 1) or cholestyramine (0. 17 g kg- 1) were given 30 min before ibuprofen administration. In cholestyramine-treated rabbits {{a significant reduction in}} ibuprofen plasma concentration was observed compared with both control (water only) and colestipol-treated rabbits. Cholestyramine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the terminal elimination half-life and the mean residence time. Furthermore, a 31 % increase in the systemic clearance and 23 % decrease in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve were also observed in cholestyramine-treated rabbits. Colestipol treatment did not change these parameters. The volume of distribution parameters (Vdss and Vd(area)) did not change following either treatment. The changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters are compatible with an acceleration of ibuprofen elimination induced by oral administration of cholestyramine and not by colestipol. This effect is thought to be due to augmentation of net biliary excretion through enteric binding...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the bile acid sequestrant, <b>colestipol</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> on the {{incidence}} of dimethylhydrazine-induced tumors of the large intestine was determined in male Swiss mice. The subcutaneous administration of dimethylhydrazine (15 mg/kg) produced tumors in approximately 89 % of the animals {{with an average of}} 1. 70 tumors per tumor-bearing animal. When carcinogen-treated animals received dietary colestipol (0. 52 %, w/w) from 4 weeks prior to the first injection of dimethylhydrazine until the time of death, there was {{an increase in the number}} of tumors per tumor-bearing animal to 2. 23. In an attempt to understand the nature of this enhancement, animals were administered dietary colestipol at different times in relation to the administration of the carcinogen. The number of tumors per tumor-bearing animal for the different protocols was: post-initiation colestipol exposure, 1. 70; colestipol exposure concomitant with dimethylhydrazine, 1. 41; pre-initiation colestipol exposure, 2. 23. Thus, colestipol appeared to function both as an anticarcinogen and as a promoter (pre-initiation). Since colestipol has the capacity to bind a number of chemical agents, the different biological effects probably reflect the multifactorial nature of colorectal cancer with the end result dependent on the balance between opposing factors. The selective administration of colestipol in relation to carcinogen administration may prove useful in elucidating the various factors involved in the etiology of this disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether a concomitant single oral dose of one of the anion exchange resins <b>colestipol</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (10 g) or cholestyramine (8 g) administered with ibuprofen (400 mg) would alter the bioavailability of this non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent. The study was performed according to a randomized three-way crossover design in six healthy male volunteers. After dosing, serial blood samples were collected for a period of 10 h. Plasma harvested from blood was analysed for ibuprofen by a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method. There were no significant differences between colestipol treatment and control for peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time to peak concentration (Tmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), mean residence time (MRT), elimination rate constant (Kel), or elimination half-life (t 1 / 2). Cholestyramine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in AUC (26 %, p < 0. 05) and Cmax (34. 4 %, p < 0. 01) and a significant increase in Tmax (80 %, p < 0. 01) and MRT (20. 2 %, p < 0. 05). Cholestyramine administration showed no significant effect on the Kel and t 1 / 2 values. A significant correlation was obtained between the increase in MRT and the increase in Tmax. The confidence intervals (90 %) of the mean values of the pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC 0 -infinity and Cmax) for the colestipol: control ratio were well within the acceptable range of 100 +/- 20, whereas those for the cholestyramine: control ratio were outside it. Colestipol treatment was found to be bioequivalent to the control treatment by Schuirmann's two one-sided t tests, while cholestyramine treatment was found to be bioinequivalent.
