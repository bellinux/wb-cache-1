5|$|The <b>chromosphere,</b> {{transition}} region, and corona {{are much}} hotter than {{the surface of}} the Sun. The reason is not well understood, but evidence suggests that Alfvén waves may have enough energy to heat the corona.|$|E
5|$|Above the <b>chromosphere,</b> {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper <b>chromosphere</b> to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|During a total solar eclipse, {{when the}} disk of the Sun {{is covered by}} that of the Moon, parts of the Sun's {{surrounding}} atmosphere can be seen. It is composed of four distinct parts: the <b>chromosphere,</b> the transition region, the corona and the heliosphere.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} recent UV and X-ray {{evidence for}} the existence of solar-type <b>chromospheres,</b> transition regions and coronae in stars other than the sun. The stellar spectral types associated with emission lines indicative of <b>chromospheres</b> and transition regions and X-ray fluxes indicative of coronae are examined, and the possibility of <b>chromospheres</b> and transition regions existing in stars hotter or cooler than the late-type stars is considered. The stellar parameters determining the properties of stellar <b>chromospheres,</b> transition regions and coronae are discussed, including varying magnetic fields, stellar rotation and convection zone parameters. A speculative scenario for the source of <b>chromospheres,</b> transition regions and coronae in O, B and A stars, late-type dwarfs, and G-M giants and supergiants is then presented which is based on the predominant role of magnetic fields in the nonradiative heating of outer atmospheres...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} the {{formation}} of the H-alpha absorption line in the <b>chromospheres</b> of cool stars is discussed and a number of results are presented which demonstrate that observations of this line can provide valuable information on certain properties of stellar <b>chromospheres.</b> It is shown that the widespread existence of strong H-alpha absorption in cool stars indicates the equally widespread existence of stellar <b>chromospheres.</b> The calculations also reinforce the idea that the great widths of H-alpha absorption lines in late-type giant stars are due to nonthermal chromospheric velocity fields...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{by which the}} geometric extent of the <b>chromospheres</b> around late-type stars can be estimated from measurements of the total emission-line flux and line ratios within the C II (UV 0. 01) multiplet. Application of this technique {{to a sample of}} 15 late-type stars indicates a clear difference in the radial extent of the <b>chromospheres</b> around coronal and noncoronal stars. The former stars appear to have very thin <b>chromospheres</b> (of no more than 0. 1 percent of the photospheric radius), while the latter stars have <b>chromospheres</b> extending, on average, out to 2. 5 photospheric radii. This, in principle, provides information for understanding structural differences between late-type giant and supergiant stars with and without coronae, and could lead {{to an understanding of the}} mass-loss mechanisms involved...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the photosphere, six other components of Betelgeuse's atmosphere have now been identified. They are a molecular environment otherwise known as the MOLsphere, a gaseous envelope, a <b>chromosphere,</b> a dust environment and two outer shells (S1 and S2) composed of carbon monoxide (CO). Some of these elements {{are known to be}} asymmetric while others overlap.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chromosphere</b> of Tau Ceti—the {{portion of}} a star's {{atmosphere}} just above the light-emitting photosphere—currently displays little or no magnetic activity, indicating a stable star. One nine-year study of temperature, granulation, and the <b>chromosphere</b> showed no systematic variations; Ca II emissions around the H and K infrared bands show a possible 11-year cycle, but this is weak relative to the Sun. Alternatively {{it has been suggested}} that the star could be in a low-activity state analogous to a Maunder minimum—a historical period, associated with the Little Ice Age in Europe, when sunspots became exceedingly rare on the Sun's surface. Spectral line profiles of Tau Ceti are extremely narrow, indicating low turbulence and observed rotation. The amplitude of the star's oscillations are about half those of the Sun, and have a lower mode lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The visible {{outer surface}} of the Sun is called the photosphere. Above this layer is a thin region known as the <b>chromosphere.</b> This is {{surrounded}} by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the super-heated corona.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chromospheres</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} also in stars other than the Sun.|$|R
40|$|New data {{indicate}} that red giants are surrounded by geometrically thick <b>chromospheres</b> of several stellar radii extent. Such <b>chromospheres</b> occur among stars which apparently lack coronae. Maintenance of this extended warm region may require non-compressional wave heating of a magnetic character, and this may provide a crucial clue to the mechanism of rapid mass loss from red giant stars...|$|R
40|$|The meiosporangia (resistant sporangia) of the watermold Allomyces contain particles, called <b>chromospheres,</b> which average 3 to 4 # in {{diameter}} and stain with basic dyes such as methyl green and methylene blue {{as well as with}} acetoorcein (1). Each sporangium contains several hundred <b>chromospheres</b> (Figs. 1 and 2). The <b>chromospheres</b> ultimately disappear (Figs. 3 and 4), a phenomenon which is completed in 24 to 36 hours (1 - 3). The sporangium is then observed to be filled with dense, granular protoplasm. The objective {{of this study was to}} establish the chemical nature of <b>chromospheres.</b> Materials and Methods Growth and Collection of Meiosporangia. [...] The Burma 1 Db strain of Allomyces arbuscula was used in this study. Stock cultures were carried on YpSs (a yeast extract-soluble starch medium) nutrient agar slants (4) with periodic mycelial transfers. To obtain meiosporangia in quantity, large numbers of YpSs nutrient agar plates were inoculated at the center with mycelial blocks. Mter the plates became covered with mycelium they were flooded with distilled water and the sporangia scraped from the surface with the edge of a glass slide...|$|R
5|$|It is safe {{to observe}} the total phase of a solar eclipse {{directly}} only when the Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon, and not before or after totality. During this period, the Sun is too dim to be seen through filters. The Sun's faint corona will be visible, and the <b>chromosphere,</b> solar prominences, and possibly even a solar flare may be seen. At the end of totality, the same effects will occur in reverse order, and {{on the opposite side}} of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The {{high levels}} of chromospheric activity, strong {{magnetic}} field, and relatively fast rotation rate of Epsilon Eridani are characteristic of a young star. Most estimates {{of the age of}} Epsilon Eridani place it in the range from 200 million to 800 million years. The low abundance of heavy elements in the <b>chromosphere</b> of Epsilon Eridani usually indicates an older star, because the interstellar medium (out of which stars form) is steadily enriched by heavier elements produced by older generations of stars. This anomaly might be caused by a diffusion process that has transported some of the heavier elements out of the photosphere and into a region below Epsilon Eridani's convection zone.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani has an {{estimated}} mass of 0.82 solar masses and a radius of 0.74 solar radii. It shines with a luminosity of only 0.34 solar luminosities. The estimated effective temperature is 5,084K. With a stellar classification of K2V, {{it is the}} second-nearest K-type main-sequence star (after Alpha Centauri B). Since 1943 the spectrum of Epsilon Eridani has served {{as one of the}} stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Its metallicity, the fraction of elements heavier than helium, is slightly lower than the Sun's. In Epsilon Eridani's <b>chromosphere,</b> a region of the outer atmosphere just above the light emitting photosphere, the abundance of iron is estimated at 74% of the Sun's value. The proportion of lithium in the atmosphere is five times less than that in the Sun.|$|E
40|$|Developments in the {{understanding}} and use of chromospheric diagnostics are discussed with emphasis on the following aspects: (1) trends emerging from semiempirical models of single stars; (2) the validity of claims that theoretical models of <b>chromospheres</b> are becoming realistic; (3) {{the correlation between the}} widths of Ca 2 H and K line emission cores and stellar absolute luminosity extending over 15 magnitudes (Wilson-Bappu relation); and (4) the existence of systematic flow patterns in stellar <b>chromospheres...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{observational}} results concerning <b>chromospheres</b> and coronae in late-type {{stars are}} described. In particular, it is indicated {{where in the}} cool half of the HR diagram <b>chromospheres,</b> transition regions, coronae, and large mass loss occur and what the important parameters determining the energy balance of these layers are. The chromospheric modelling process is summarized and models of the late-type supergiants Beta Dra, Epsilon Gem, and Alpha Ori recently computed by Basri and Linsky (1980) are detailed...|$|R
40|$|The <b>chromospheres</b> of evolved {{stars with}} {{peculiar}} chemical abundances are reviewed, emphasizing {{the dependence of}} chromospheric properties on the evolutionary status of the stars. A sample of intermediate mass stars observed in the radio, IR and UV wavelength regions is compiled. The <b>chromospheres</b> of MS, S, and C stars are compared with one another. The sample is used to study the relationship between stellar parameters and chromospheric heating. The results are used to construct a scenario for AGB evolution...|$|R
5|$|The first {{evidence}} of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as {{a bright yellow}} line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers in the spectrum of the <b>chromosphere</b> of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D3 Fraunhofer line because it was near the known D1 and D2 lines of sodium. He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun, ἥλιος (helios).|$|E
5|$|When the helium is exhausted, the Sun {{will repeat}} the {{expansion}} it followed when the hydrogen {{in the core}} was exhausted, except that this time it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity {{to as much as}} 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU. According to a 2008 model, Earth's orbit is shrinking due to tidal forces (and, eventually, drag from the lower <b>chromosphere),</b> so that it will be engulfed by the Sun near the tip of the red giant branch phase, 1 and 3.8 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate. Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars {{at the tip of the}} asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius. For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula. By the end of that phase – lasting approximately 500,000 years – the Sun will only have about half of its current mass.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} power {{required}} to heat the solar corona can easily be calculated as the difference between coronal radiative losses and heating by thermal conduction toward the <b>chromosphere</b> through the transition region. It is about 1 kilowatt for every square meter of surface area on the Sun's <b>chromosphere,</b> or 1/40000 {{of the amount of}} light energy that escapes the Sun.|$|E
40|$|We explore subtle {{variations}} in disk-integrated measurements spanning ∼ 10 years. Subject headings: numerical methods — stars: <b>chromospheres</b> — stars: rotation – 3...|$|R
25|$|Also A-stars do {{not have}} {{convection}} zones {{but they do not}} emit at the UV and X-ray wavelengths. Thus they appear to have neither <b>chromospheres</b> nor coronae.|$|R
25|$|The astronomical {{observations}} planned {{with the}} Einstein Observatory by Giuseppe Vaiana {{and his group}} showed that F-, G-, K- and M-stars have <b>chromospheres</b> and often coronae much like our Sun.|$|R
25|$|One {{problem with}} wave heating is {{delivery}} of the heat to the appropriate place. Magneto-acoustic waves cannot carry sufficient energy upward through the <b>chromosphere</b> to the corona, both because of the low pressure present in the <b>chromosphere</b> and {{because they tend to}} be reflected back to the photosphere. Alfvén waves can carry enough energy, but do not dissipate that energy rapidly enough once they enter the corona. Waves in plasmas are notoriously difficult to understand and describe analytically, but computer simulations, carried out by Thomas Bogdan and colleagues in 2003, seem to show that Alfvén waves can transmute into other wave modes {{at the base of the}} corona, providing a pathway that can carry large amounts of energy from the photosphere through the <b>chromosphere</b> and transition region and finally into the corona where it dissipates it as heat.|$|E
25|$|Investigation of {{the outer}} layer of the Sun, which {{consists}} of the <b>chromosphere,</b> transition region, and the corona. CDS, EIT, LASCO, SUMER, SWAN, and UVCS are used for this solar atmosphere remote sensing.|$|E
25|$|Filament {{cavities}} are zones which look {{dark in the}} X-rays and {{are above}} the regions where Hα filaments are observed in the <b>chromosphere.</b> They were first observed in the two 1970 rocket flights which also detected coronal holes.|$|E
50|$|The astronomical {{observations}} planned {{with the}} Einstein Observatory by Giuseppe Vaiana {{and his group}} showed that F-, G-, K- and M-stars have <b>chromospheres</b> and often coronae much like our Sun.The O-B stars, which do not have surface convection zones, have a strong X-ray emission. However these stars do not have coronas, but the outer stellar envelopes emit this radiation during shocks due to thermal instabilities in rapidly moving gas blobs.Also A-stars do not have convection zones {{but they do not}} emit at the UV and X-ray wavelengths. Thus they appear to have neither <b>chromospheres</b> nor coronae.|$|R
50|$|Star C is {{separated}} from the A-B pair by 700 arc seconds, compared to a minimum of 4.6 arcsec for A-B, so {{its effect on the}} movements of the A-B pair is small. A and B have active <b>chromospheres.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} thermal free-free {{millimetre}} fluxes expected from non-dusty and non-pulsating K through mid-M giant stars {{based on our}} limited understanding of their inhomogeneous <b>chromospheres.</b> We present a semi-analytic model that provides estimates of the radio fluxes for the mm wavelengths (e. g., CARMA, ALMA, JVLA Q-band) based on knowledge of the effective temperatures, angular diameters and chromospheric Mg II h & k emission fluxes. At 250 GHz, the chromospheric optical depths {{are expected to be}} significantly less than unity, which means that fluxes across the mm and sub-mm range will have a contribution from the chromospheric mate- rial that gives rise to the ultraviolet emission spectrum, as well as the cool molecular material known to exist above the photosphere. We predict a lower bound to the inferred brightness temperature of red giants based on heating at the basal-flux limit if the upper <b>chromospheres</b> have filling factor 1. Multi-frequency mm observations should provide important new information on the structuring of the inhomogeneous <b>chromospheres,</b> including the boundary layer, and allow tests of competing theoretical models for atmospheric heating. We comment on the suitability of these stars as mm flux calibrators...|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{proved to}} be correct and their naming of the phenomena became the international standard. Wild likened this research {{to the study of}} taxonomy that preceded Darwin's Origin of species. His analysis of the anatomy of the solar flares and his development of the physical interpretation culminated in a unified model that integrated the apparently complex radio flare phenomena in the solar <b>chromosphere,</b> solar corona, and in the interplanetary space.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} {{is the same}} as the one in the Sun's interior, mainly hydrogen, but completely ionized, thence protons and electrons, and a small fraction of the other atoms in the same percentages as they are present in the photosphere. Heavier metals, such as iron, are partially ionized and have lost most of the external electrons. The ionization state of a chemical element depends strictly on the temperature and is regulated by the Saha equation. Historically, the presence of the spectral lines emitted from highly ionized states of iron allowed determination of the high temperature of the coronal plasma, revealing that the corona is much hotter than the internal layers of the <b>chromosphere.</b>|$|E
25|$|The sun's corona is much hotter (by {{a factor}} from 150 to 450) than the visible {{surface of the}} Sun: the photosphere's average {{temperature}} is 5800 kelvin compared to the corona's one to three million kelvins. The corona is 10−12 times as dense as the photosphere, and so produces about one-millionth as much visible light. The corona is separated from the photosphere by the relatively shallow <b>chromosphere.</b> The exact mechanism by which the corona is heated is still the subject of some debate, but likely possibilities include induction by the Sun's magnetic field and magnetohydrodynamic waves from below. The outer edges of the Sun's corona are constantly being transported away due to open magnetic flux and hence generating the solar wind.|$|E
50|$|These {{are close}} binary systems with highly active <b>chromospheres,</b> {{including}} huge sunspots and flares, {{believed to be}} enhanced by the close companion. Variability scales ranges from days, close to the orbital period and sometimes also with eclipses, to years as sunspot activity varies.|$|R
40|$|A VLA {{continuum}} {{survey of}} 22 cool M and C type giants and supergiants {{has been conducted}} in order to investigate the physical properties of the partially ionized, expanding <b>chromospheres</b> of the coolest luminous star. The results indicate small upper limits for the ionized-mass-loss rates and 2 - 6 cm spectral indices that are much steeper than the 0. 6 value predicted by the standard stellar-wind model. It is suggested that hydrogen is predominantly neutral and that carbon and other metals may not be completely ionized {{in many of the}} late M giants. For several of the stars the brightness-temperature upper limits imply that the winds and <b>chromospheres</b> are optically thin at 6 cm, setting useful constraints on the chromospheric emission for these stars...|$|R
