25|$|In deep marine environments, {{the water}} current working the sea bottom is small. Only fine {{particles}} can be transported to such places. Typically sediments depositing {{on the ocean}} floor are fine clay or small skeletons of micro-organisms. At 4km depth, the solubility of carbonates increases dramatically (the depth zone where this happens is called the lysocline). <b>Calcareous</b> <b>sediment</b> that sinks below the lysocline dissolves, as a result no limestone can be formed below this depth. Skeletons of micro-organisms formed of silica (such as radiolarians) are not as soluble and still deposit. An example of a rock formed of silica skeletons is radiolarite. When {{the bottom of the sea}} has a small inclination, for example at the continental slopes, the sedimentary cover can become unstable, causing turbidity currents. Turbidity currents are sudden disturbances of the normally quite deep marine environment and can cause the geologically speaking instantaneous deposition of large amounts of sediment, such as sand and silt. The rock sequence formed by a turbidity current is called a turbidite.|$|E
6000|$|Thus, in {{the whole}} of the [...] "intermediate zone," [...] the silicious deposit which is being formed there, as elsewhere, by the {{accumulation}} of sponge- spicula, Radiolaria, and Diatoms, is obscured and overpowered by the immensely greater amount of <b>calcareous</b> <b>sediment,</b> which arises from the aggregation of the skeletons of dead Foraminifera. The similarity of the deposit, thus composed of a large percentage of carbonate of lime, and a small percentage of silex, to chalk, regarded merely as a kind of rock, which was first pointed out by Ehrenberg,[5] is now admitted on all hands; nor can it be reasonably doubted, that ordinary metamorphic agencies are competent to convert the [...] "modern chalk" [...] into hard limestone or even into crystalline marble.|$|E

If it be asked, at what rate in years I suppose a reef of coral favourably circumstanced could grow up from a given depth; I should answer, that we have no precise evidence on this point, and comparatively little concern with it. We see, in innumerable points over wide areas, that the rate has been sufficient, either to bring up the reefs from various depths to the surface, or, as is more probable, to keep them at the surface, during progressive subsidences; and this is a much more important standard of comparison than any cycle of years.|$|E

40|$|Correlation {{of mineral}} {{associations}} from sediment recovered on the northwestern Australian continental margin document the juvenile-to-mature {{evolution of a}} segment of the Indian Ocean. Lower Cretaceous sediments contain sandy-to-silty radiolarian claystone that consists of highly smectitic mixed-layered illite/smectite (I/S) in addition to minor amounts of diagenetic pyrite, barite, and rhodochrosite. These immature, poorly sorted sediments were derived from nearby continental margin sources. Discrete bentonite layers and abundant smectite are the alteration products of volcanic material deposited during early basin formation. Abundant quartz-replaced radiolarian tests suggest high surface-water productivity, and calcareous fossils indicate water depths were above the calcite compensation depth (CCD) in the juvenile Indian Ocean. The increase in pelagic carbonate from the mid- to Late Cretaceous signals the transition to mature, open-ocean conditions. Similar to other slowly deposited contemporaneous deep-sea sediments, mid- to Upper Cretaceous sediments of the northwestern margin of Australia contain palygorskite. This palygorskite is associated with <b>calcareous</b> <b>sediment</b> across the ooze-to-chalk transition, detrital mixed-layered I/S, and zeolite minerals in places. This palygorskite occurs above the transformation from opal-A to opal-CT.

50|$|The third type of {{tesselation}} {{recognized by}} Branagan {{is associated with}} the shrinkage and cracking of fine-grained, either clayey or <b>calcareous,</b> <b>sediments.</b> They consist of polygonal cracking, often associated with individual 'plates' that tend to be concave upward, that characterizes the formation of mudcracks in fine-grained sediments.

40|$|The {{ability of}} rock-magnetic {{properties}} {{to serve as}} a proxy sedimentological, stratigraphic, and paleoceanographic indicator for deep-sea sediments was tested by detailed rock-magnetic measurements of pelagic sediment cores from the central and western North Pacific. ^ Results from the eleven piston cores from the three areas in the western North Pacific show that detailed variations in the rock-magnetic parameters can be readily correlated between cores within each area. Major trends in the magnetic grain-size variation recorded in two <b>calcareous</b> <b>sediment</b> cores (DSDP Holes 577 and 577 A) are consistent with those of a core from the central North Pacific (LL 44 -GPC 3). This relationship indicates that rock-magnetic techniques provide a rapid and non-destructive tool for regional and possible basin-wide correlation of pelagic sediment cores. ^ The observed regional magnetic grain-size variations of the study cores are in good agreement with the eolian grain-size data obtained from analyses of the total eolian component of the sediment, indicating that grain-size-dependent rock-magnetic parameters can provide information about total eolian grain-size variation. Major fluctuations in concentration-dependent rock-magnetic parameters plotted as accumulation rates for core LL 44 -GPC 3 correspond to intervals of paleoenvironmental change that have been detected previously by other paleoceanographic methods. Thus, rock-magnetic methods constitute a valuable new tool for paleoceanographic studies, because of their speed, simplicity, and non-destructiveness. ^ Rock-magnetic parameters show a distinctive pattern of high concentration of relatively coarse magnetic grains at the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary in cores from both the central and western North Pacific, suggesting that these techniques may provide a valuable tool for rapidly identifying the K/T boundary. ^ Finally, detailed paleomagnetic records of two <b>calcareous</b> <b>sediment</b> cores provide excellent magnetostratigraphies that are characterized by a complete geomagnetic polarity sequence for the interval 0 - 5 Ma and an almost complete polarity sequence for the interval 50 - 70 Ma. ...|$|E
