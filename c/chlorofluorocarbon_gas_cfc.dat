50|$|In 2009, however, Ward {{noticed that}} the lowest levels of total column ozone since {{measurements}} began in 1927 occurred in 1992 and 1993 following the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo—the largest volcanic eruption since 1912. He subsequently found that similar depletion of ozone follows most volcanic eruptions, even small ones. From these observations, he argued that sulfate in ice cores is an important measure of the rate of volcanic activity, but that warming appears to result from ozone depletion by volcanic emissions of chlorine and bromine, which allows more ultraviolet-B radiation to reach Earth's surface, cooling the stratosphere and warming Earth. All eruptions deplete ozone, causing warming, but explosive eruptions, unlike effusive eruptions, also form stratospheric aerosols, which reflect and scatter sunlight, causing net cooling. He also argued that chlorine from man-made <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> <b>gases</b> (<b>CFCs)</b> apparently caused the global warming observed from 1970 to 1998 by depleting the ozone layer, and that reduction of CFC emissions mandated by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer led to the Global Warming Hiatus from 1998 to 2013, during which no statistically significant warming occurred. Warming began again in August 2014 when Bárðarbunga volcano in Central Iceland erupted 85 square kilometers of basaltic lava in six months—the largest effusive volcanic eruption since 1783. As with most effusive volcanic eruptions, this one did not form cooling aerosols in the stratosphere.|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of {{groundwater}} residence time {{is important in}} understanding key issues {{in the evolution of}} water quality, whether this occurs due to water–rock interaction or simply by mixing or contamination. The build-up in the atmosphere of the trace <b>gases</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> (<b>CFCs)</b> and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) {{from the middle of the}} last century offers a convenient way of dating waters up to ~ 60 yrs old. The gases are well-mixed in the atmosphere so their input functions are not area-specific as is the case with tritium. While any one of these trace gases can in principle provide a groundwater age, when two or more are measured on water samples the potential exists to distinguish between different modes of flow including piston flow, exponential flow and simple end-member mixing. As with all groundwater dating methods, caveats apply. Factors such as recharge temperature and elevation must be reasonably well-constrained. Primarily for SF 6, the phenomenon of ‘excess air’ also requires consideration. Primarily for the CFCs, local sources of contamination need to be considered, as do redox conditions. For both SF 6 and the CFCs, the nature and thickness of the unsaturated zone need to be factored into residence time calculations. However, as an inexpensive dating method, the trace gases can be applied to a wide range {{of groundwater}} problems where traditional age indicators might once have been used more sparingly. Examples include tracing flowlines, detecting small modern inputs in ‘old’ waters, and pollution risk assessment.

30|$|For {{instance}} – {{to mention}} some spectacular cases – in the 1960 s <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> <b>gas</b> was successfully marketed {{as a major}} chemical innovation {{in the production of}} cooling agent, fire-extinguishing agents, multi-purpose lubricants, aerosol such as in hair sprays, and many other purposes. It seemed to solve many technical problems in an inexpensive and convenient way. Only years later it was discovered what immense social costs the innovation caused. Chlorofluorocarbon emissions contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect. Moreover, the gas accumulated in the stratosphere and started to destroy the Earth’s ozone layer. After the discovery a cumbersome process of reaching an agreement on collectively putting a ban on <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> <b>gas</b> use started. While the process was eventually successful it may last long until the ozone layer fully recovers. Further examples of innovations passing the market test as supposed solutions for technical or commercial problems which later turned out to cause immense social costs are not difficult to find: new materials such as asbestos; new pesticides such as DDT; new drugs such as Rofecoxib (Vioxx); new techniques such as nuclear power generation or deep sea oil drilling, and so on (see also (Tenner 1996)).|$|R

Also, to find out if the technique can predict whether manual aspiration will be successful, hence avoiding the need for intercostal tube drainage. DESIGN [...] Prospective study of 25 episodes of pneumothorax during which patients breathed air from a Douglas bag that contained <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> <b>gases</b> from a metered dose inhaler while the pneumothorax was aspirated. SETTING [...] Medical unit of a district general hospital. PATIENTS [...] 22 patients who presented over nine months with acute pneumothorax. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Presence or absence of <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> marker <b>gases</b> in the aspirate. Presence or absence of sustained re-expansion of the affected lung in the chest radiograph. RESULTS [...] Marker gas was detected in the aspirate from 16 out of 25 pneumothoraces. Of these, 13 required intercostal tube drainage because of failure of the lung to re-expand. Marker gas was not detected in nine cases, and in all of these cases manual aspiration resulted in sustained re-expansion of the lung. CONCLUSIONS [...] The presence or absence of a pleural leak during manual aspiration of spontaneous pneumothorax can be shown by using this technique. The absence of marker gas in the aspirate implies that manual aspiration will be successful, whereas its presence predicts, in most cases, either failure of manual aspiration to expand the lung or early re-collapse of the lung...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This report {{presents}} {{new information}} regarding emissions of CFC 12 {{used to make}} extruded polystyrene foam products. Earlier reports identified {{a significant difference in}} emission rates from extruded polystyrene foam that are used to estimate the amount of the chlorofluorocarbon yet to be released from these materials – the banked amount.

This report will provide evidence that CFC 12 is emitted from extruded polystyrene foam more than an order of magnitude slower than some earlier reported rates, resulting in a bank of CFC 12, yet to be released from the foam, potentially larger than previously estimated.

40|$|Reactive {{inorganic}} chlorine plays {{a crucial}} role in the stratospheric ozone depletion.

As these source gases are photolysed in the stratosphere into inorganic chlorine and fluorine, respectively, the turn over of the inorganic chlorine (HCl and ClONO 2) and slowing down of fluorine (HF and COF 2) reservoirs act as a verification of the effectiveness of these protocols. Here we present results of long-term measurements of the stratospheric column of HCl, ClONO 2, and HF obtained at different stations in the northern hemisphere (Ny Alesund, Kiruna, Zugspitze, Jungfraujoch, Izana, all affiliated to the NDACC, Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change) within the PEP (Pole- Equator-Pole) network.
