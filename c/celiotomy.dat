40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} describing the hepatic and splenic blunt trauma, indicates that as many as 67 % of exploratory <b>celiotomies,</b> are reports as diagnostic. Avoiding unnecessary surgical procedure offers an attractive choice. Nevertheless, nonsurgical management should not bew considered unless the patient meets the following criteria: 1) hemodynamic stability, with or without minimal fluid resuscitation; 2) no demonstrable peritoneal signs on abdominal examination; and 3) the absence on computer tomography (CT scan) of any intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal injuries that require operative intervention. Although a patient could meet the above criteria, several additional factors can be used as predictors of failure of non surgical treatment...|$|R
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{effectiveness}} of peritoneal lavage and to define its limitations {{in the evaluation of}} patients who have sustained blunt abdominal trauma, a prospective study of 500 such patients was undertaken by the Trauma Service at the Naval Hospital, San Diego. Utilizing a qualitative colorometric method to evaluate the degree of hemoperitoneum, patients could rapidly be divided into three clinical groups: strongly positive, weakly positive, and negative. Using this method, patients with a strongly positive peritoneal lavage had a 94 % incidence of significant intra-abdominal injuries. In 333 patients with a negative lavage, there was no documented incidence of significant intra-abdominal injuries. Visceral angiography and abdominal echography were utilized in this group of patients to identify those with significant intra-abdominal injuries. By utilizing this approach, there were only eight unnecessary <b>celiotomies</b> in the total group of 500 patients. It is concluded, therefore, that peritoneal lavage is a safe, rapid, and effective means of evaluating patients who have sustained blunt abdominal trauma...|$|R

40|$|<b>Celiotomy</b> in cirrhotic {{patients}} {{is reported to}} bear {{a high risk of}} operative morbidity and mortality. We reviewed 100 consecutive, cirrhotic patients who underwent nonshunt <b>celiotomy.</b> Thirty patients died and major complications occurred in another 30 patients. Hospital mortality rate was 21 % in 39 biliary operations, 35 % in 26 procedures for peptic ulcer disease, and 55 % in nine colectomies. Fifty-two variables were compared between survivors without complication, survivors with complications, and nonsurvivors. A computer-generated, multivariant discriminant analysis yielded an equation predictive of survival. Utilizing coagulation parameters, presence of active infection, and serum albumin, the equation predicted survival with 89 % accuracy. In a similar fashion, amount of operative transfusions, absence of postoperative ascites, pulmonary failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and culture-positive urine predicted survival with 100 % accuracy. We conclude that <b>celiotomy</b> in the cirrhotic patient is truly associated with very high morbidity and mortality, and preoperative assessment can predict survival with 89 % accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Cryptorchidism is {{the most}} common {{developmental}} defect in the horse (Schambourg, M. A. et al, 2006). Studies have shown 2 - 8 % prevalence for this condition in horses. Cryptorchidism is characterized by failure of one or both testes to descend into the scrotum. Retained testes can be found anywhere between the caudal poles of the kidneys to subcutaneously outside of the body wall, but abdominal retention {{is the most}} common presentation (Amann, R. P. and Veeramachaneni, D. N. R., 2007). Normal and disturbed testicular descent is frequently approached exclusively through consideration of the caudal testicular suspensory apparatus. However, embryological gonads develop with both cranial and caudal suspensory ligaments, and the sexes differ in respect to the persistence and development of both the cranial and caudal ligaments (Van Der Schoot, P. and Elger, W., 1992). The following case report illustrates an atypical case of bilateral abdominal cryptorchidism. "Starham's Yellow Brick", a 3 year old male Quarter Horse that presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals for persistence of stallion-like behavior despite previously reported castration. Upon physical examination, testes could not be seen or palpated within the scrotum. After performing an hCG stimulation test and measuring testosterone, the diagnosis of cryptorchidism was made. Laparoscopic abdominal exploratory with the horse in dorsal recumbency was unsuccessful in locating the testis. Bilateral exploratory flank <b>celiotomies</b> were then performed and the testes were located and removed from an unusual anatomical position...|$|R
40|$|CASE DESCRIPTION A 7 -year-old 573 -kg (1, 261 -lb) Swiss Warmblood gelding was {{evaluated}} because of signs of acute abdominal pain. CLINICAL FINDINGS Physical examination revealed a markedly distended abdomen with subjectively reduced borborygmi in all abdominal quadrants. A large, gas-distended viscus {{was present at}} the pelvic brim preventing complete palpation of the abdomen per rectum. Ultrasonographic evaluation could not be safely performed in the initial evaluation because of severe signs of abdominal pain. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Ventral midline <b>celiotomy</b> was performed, and right dorsal displacement of the ascending colon was corrected. Progressive signs of abdominal pain after surgery prompted repeat ventral midline <b>celiotomy,</b> and small intestinal incarceration in a large, radial mesojejunal rent was detected. The incarceration was reduced, but the defect was not fully accessible for repair via the <b>celiotomy.</b> Repair of the mesenteric defect was not attempted, and conservative management was planned after surgery; however, signs of colic returned. A standard laparoscopic approach was attempted from both flanks in the standing patient, but the small intestine could not be adequately mobilized for full evaluation of the rent. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) allowed identification and reduction of jejunal incarceration and repair of the mesenteric rent. Although minor ventral midline incisional complications were encountered, the horse recovered fully. CLINICAL RELEVANCE HALS techniques should be considered for repair of mesenteric rents in horses. In the horse of this report, HALS facilitated identification, evaluation, and repair of a large radial mesenteric rent that was not accessible from a ventral median <b>celiotomy...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{sensitivity of}} conventional assays of liver function was evaluated in com- parison with galactose clearance, {{a test of}} liver function used in humans since the 1960 s. Results of galactose clearance tests were compared with plasma enzyme concentrations and serum bile acid levels in clinically normal galahs (Eolophus roseicapillus; n = 8), after <b>celiotomy</b> (n = 4), and after 6 % or 18 % hepatectomy (n = 8, respectively). Clearance tests and biochemical analyses were performed within 2 - 4 hours of surgery and at 4 and 7 days after surgery. <b>Celiotomy</b> and 6 % and 18 % hepatectomy resulted in changes in alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and al- anine aminotransferase concentrations that were consistent with muscle trauma. <b>Celiotomy</b> and 6 % hepatectomy did not significantly alter the results of galactose clearance tests; however, 18 % hep- atectomy resulted in significant reduction in galactose clearance and galactose clearance as a func- tion of body surface area (GEC-SA). Galactose single-point concentrations were not significantly elevated {{at any time during}} the experiments; however, single-point concentrations were strongly correlated with galactose clearance and GEC-SA values, especially at 80 minutes after galactose injection. Serum bile acid levels were not significantly elevated after <b>celiotomy</b> or partial hepatec- tomy. Measurement of galactose single-point concentrations has the potential to be a simple, sen- sitive method of screening for reduced hepatic function in birds. Galactose clearance and GEC-SA have the potential to be sensitive assays of hepatic functional mass, for use as a noninvasive method of monitoring hepatic function...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{advances}} in technology {{have made it possible}} to decompress acute pseudo-obstruction of the colon with colonoscope instead of <b>celiotomy</b> and cecostomy. Twenty-two patients who developed acute pseudo-obstruction of the colon and underwent colonoscopy were analyzed. The authors were successful in completely or partially decompressing the dilated colon in 19 of 22 patients. There were no complications. Acute pseudo-obstruction of the colon is usually secondary to intra- or extra-abdominal insult resulting in direct or reflex derangement of the sacral parasympathetic outflow. This causes a functional obstruction of the left colon. The goal of management is to prevent colonic perforation while treating the primary problems. Once the diagnosis has been made, colonoscopy should be attempted. <b>Celiotomy</b> should be reserved to cases in which colonoscopy is unsuccessful or in cases with perforation or impending perforation...|$|E

The mild nature of the colic, the findings on palpation per rectum, and the continued passage of feces in 40 % of horses, frequently led to the diagnosis and treatment of colonic impaction prior to admission. The condition was correctly diagnosed prior to exploratory <b>celiotomy,</b> by palpation per rectum, in only 18 % of cases. Two types of displacement were identified.

40|$|Objective: To assess {{risk factors}} for <b>celiotomy</b> incisional {{infection}} in horses, especially the use of staples for skin closure. Study Design: Case series. Animals: Horses (n = 356) that had 1 exploratory <b>celiotomy</b> for colic and survived > 2 weeks after surgery between March 1, 2004 and December 31, 2007. Methods; Incisions were classified as “normal” (no complication, only edema, serous drainage lasting < 24 hours) or as “surgical site infection (SSI) ” (persistent serosanguinous drainage or purulent drainage with or without positive bacterial culture). All possible risk factors, including method of skin closure (monofilament sutures or staples), were statistically analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Of 356 horses, 303 (85 %) had normal wound healing and 53 (15 %) developed a SSI (purulent: 48 [14 %]; persistent serosanguinous: 5 [1 %]). Bacterial cultures were positive in 33 of 40 cases. Factors significantly associated with SSI in the multivariate analysis were: use of staples for skin closure (OR 3. 85, P <. 001) and surgical site closure by a 1 st or 2 nd year resident (OR 2. 20, P =. 016). Lavage of the linea alba with sterile saline solution after closure was a protective factor (OR 0. 38, P =. 004). Conclusion: Use of staples for skin closure and less experienced surgeons closing the abdomen are {{risk factors for}} incisional infection. Incisional lavage after linea alba closure was a protective factor. Clinical Relevance: Despite their ease and speed of application, skin staples can {{lead to an increase}} in <b>celiotomy</b> wound complications in horses...|$|E
40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Incisional {{complications}} {{are a major}} post operative challenge following ventral midline exploratory <b>celiotomy</b> for {{abdominal pain}} in horses. They lead to discomfort, prolonged hospitalisation, longer recovery times and increased cost; therefore, investigation of preventative procedures are warranted. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effect of antibacterial (triclosan) coated 2 - 0 polyglactin 910 suture material on the likelihood of incisional infections when used for closure of subcutaneous tissue following ventral midline celiotomies in horses. METHODS: One hundred horses undergoing exploratory <b>celiotomy</b> assigned at random to one of 2 groups. In the control group coated 2 - 0 polyglactin 910 (Vicryl) was used for apposition of the subcutaneous tissue in a simple continuous pattern and, in the study group, antibacterial (triclosan) coated 2 - 0 polyglactin 910 suture material (Vicryl Plus) was used. Post operatively an elastic adhesive abdominal bandage was applied, changed and the incision was inspected by a clinician blinded to the study protocol at 24 - 36 h and 6 - 9 days post operatively. Outcomes of interest were evidence of incisional pain, incisional oedema, sheath/udder oedema, incisional drainage, hernia formation and dehiscence. RESULTS: Antibacterial-coated suture material did not decrease the likelihood of incisional complications in 100 horses. CONCLUSIONS: A beneficial effect on ventral midline incisions in 100 horses was not evident by using antibacterial-coated suture material. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Lack of effectiveness of antibacterial-coated suture material in equine ventral midline closure after exploratory <b>celiotomy</b> and the observed potential adverse effects suggest that further clinical investigations are needed before using such material routinely on horses...|$|E

40|$|Four {{cases of}} {{ulceration}} and stricture {{of the right}} dorsal colon were encountered. Ulceration of the right dorsal colon is generally associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) toxicosis but there are few reports of stricture following ulceration. All four horses had recent phenylbutazone use: three had been given doses well {{in excess of the}} recommended dose and in one the dose was marginally above those recommended but was combined with administration of other NSAIDs. All four horses presented with intermittent low-grade colic, weight loss and ventral oedema. Diarrhoea was also seen in three of them. All had hypoproteinaemia due to severe hypoalbuminaemia, and hyperfibrinogenaemia. Hypoalbuminaemia was less severe in one horse and this horse was successfully managed medically. Two cases were definitively diagnosed at exploratory <b>celiotomy</b> and two at necropsy. Exploratory <b>celiotomy</b> was performed in two horses: one was euthanased at surgery and one was managed successfully with medical treatment and remained normal 1 year after surgery.
