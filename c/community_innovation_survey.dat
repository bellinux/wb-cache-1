40|$|Recent {{analyses}} of <b>Community</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Survey</b> (CIS) data suffer from methodological shortcomings. Using Finnish CIS data, we illustrate the potential {{consequences of these}} shortcomings and propose {{ways of dealing with}} them. We show how the neglect of lag structures between dependent and independent variables has certain consequences on the results. It is also important to check and identify any differences in the typical lifecycle durations between industries. Finally, the precise definition of ‘innovators’ {{to be included in the}} estimate also has a significant impact on the results, as does the non-normal distribution of shares in the sales of innovative products. Earlier studies have not been too explicit on some of these problems.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the disclosure limitation of microdata from the <b>Community</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Survey</b> of manufacturing and services sector enterprises. Business surveys such as the <b>Community</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Survey</b> often pose particular problems for disclosure limitation methodology. There are several reasons for this. First, {{in order to provide}} the best possible representation of the population, business survey designs include the largest and most identifiable enterprises with probability one; see Cox (1995). Secondly, public registers are available that contain the names of enterprises together with such features as their main economic activity, geographical area and number of employees. Accordingly, the match between public registers and an unprotected sample can often be an easy task, especially when a priori information is available. In this case identification and hence disclosure is accomplished without too much difficult...|$|E

In particuiar, we investigate growth differences between R&D-performing firms and non-R&D performers. As internal R&D is only one source of innovativeness, we also consider growth contributions of product and process innovations. Using a sample of more than 1, 200 firms in Flemish manufacturing and selected services, we find that R&D-performers show an almost 6 %-points higher growtb rate between 2002 and 2004 than non-R&D performers, on average. However, once product and process innovation are introduced in the model, the contribution of R&D drops to about 4 %-points. Interestingly, we find that process innovations are an important driver of productivity growth while product innovations have no significant impact once it is controlled for R&D activity.

The results indicate that the capacity of firms to build on external domestic linkages is what matters most for the innovation output. And that foreign external linkages lead to superior innovation performance only in combination with the domestic ones. Also the results suggest that the positive effect of domestic cooperation is driven by linkages to education, research and scientific institutions, even though these types of partners tend to be used by firms noticeably less frequently for cooperation on innovation than their suppliers and customers.

The data set for this analysis is taken from the <b>Community</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Survey</b> which allows us to compare the results obtained with results obtained for other countries. For reasons discussed in the study the Finnish results are checked against results obtained for analyses of the <b>Community</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Survey</b> in Germany. Concerning the overall effects of public funding in Finland we can draw quite positive conclusions based on our empirical analysis: First, on average, public funding increases the private innovation effort of funded firms, in both nominal and real terms.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{conducted}} under the research project “Enterprise of the Future: Trends and Scenarios towards Competitiveness” which attempts to disclosure determinants of future enterprise competitiveness. Innovation {{is not only}} a must today but also an imperative in future competitiveness scenarios. In modern evolutionary economics it is argued that sector-specific factors are one of the key factors explaining innovative behaviour and performance of firms. Several contributions have pointed that industries largely differ in terms of knowledge base and technological sources, opportunities and appropriation of innovative activities, technological trajectories and firms’ strategies. Using as background Pavitt’s taxonomy, this paper explores the nature, extent and sources of variety of innovation in the manufacturing industry, aiming at identifying common patterns across industries, and sectoral patterns across countries. This paper presents evidence based on the aggregated results of the last IV <b>Community</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Survey</b> released by EUROSTAT (CIS 4), for which data is available for a number of industries and countries. innovation, manufacturing industry, <b>Community</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>survey</b> CIS...|$|E

40|$|The {{innovation}} {{performance of}} firms is primarily determined {{by their own}} innovative activities and the interaction with their innovation-related environment. This environment typically differs among countries. We assess empirically these differences on firms' innovation performance. To that end we first estimate the relationship between an aggregate innovation input measure and an aggregate innovation output measure, thereby explicitly controlling for structural differences between countries. We then consider {{the extent to which}} firms located in a particular country perform better or worse than this estimated benchmark performance. The analysis is based on a panel dataset that we have constructed from Eurostat's first and second <b>Community</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Survey.</b> In order to control for possible data contamination we employ an outlier-robust estimator. It appears that among the fourteen countries considered Italy, Germany and Ireland offer an environment that facilitates most the transformation of innovation-related inputs into commercial outputs while the environment in Denmark is the least facilitating.

40|$|Patent {{citation}} {{data are}} used in {{a growing body of}} economics and business research on technological diffusion. Research in this area uses “backward” citations to measure technological knowledge acquired by the patenting entities studied. “Forward” citations (citations to the firm’s patents made by other patents) have been interpreted as a measure of the knowledge diffusing outward from the patenting entity. Until now, there exists little evidence on whether or not patent citations are a good measure of knowledge flows. Our paper assesses the legitimacy of using European patent citations as a measure of technology flows. It uses information from the <b>Community</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Survey</b> (CIS) collected by the French Service des Statistiques Industrielles (SESSI), which contain firms’ responses to questions about their innovative activity. We show that patent citations are indeed related to firms’ statements about their acquisition and dispersion of new technology, but that the strength and statistical significance of this relationship varies across geographical regions and across channels of knowledge diffusion. patent, citation, <b>Community</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Survey,</b> innovation, spillovers, count data...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{starts with}} a brief summary of {{theoretical}} perspectives {{on the relationship between}} multinationality and innovation and the move from a centralized and hierarchical perspective to a more decentralized network-based one. Four hypotheses are set up to test the relationship between multinationality and innovation, using data from the <b>Community</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Survey</b> 12 for the financial services sector. All models control for the size of the enterprise. The results show that multinationality is positively related to innovation activities. The positive impact of being part of a multinational company (MNC) on the propensity to innovate seems largely {{due to the fact that}} MNCs operate in different countries rather than, or more than, to the enterprise being part of a group. The relevance of multinationality appears to be higher, the higher the degree of internationalization of the company of which the enterprise is part.
