40|$|Management of the {{stockyard}} layout in the precast <b>concrete</b> <b>products</b> <b>industry</b> is {{very important}} for efficient storage and dispatch of the concrete products. The industry uses the make-to-stock principle in production to meet the seasonal demand (high in summer and low in winter) from the construction industry. In order to stabilize production output and cater for the huge demand in summer, stock is built up during the winter and spring period. The concrete products are kept in stock for 4 - 5 months. As 2000 - 3000 different precast concrete products are produced, and the products have different size, weight and handling requirements, determination of appropriate stockyard location for the products constitutes a comples process. This paper describes some ongoing research that is focused on identifying the appropriate methodology for designing and managing the stockyard layout that ensures efficient storage and dispatch of products, and provides ease of rotation of products within the yard. An integrated simulation model employing artificial intelligence methods has been proposed to evaluate 'what-if' scenarios and recommend a suitable methodology for the management of stockyard space for precast concrete products. This paper presents the findings from a case study, which includes work-study, frequency analysis of historical order data. The paper also introduces the specifications, processes and outline prototype of the proposed model. A general purpose simulation language (SIMAN) based software, 'Arena 4. 0 ' (Systems Modelling Corporation), has been selected to develop the prototype simulation model and ILOG views and rules have been considered to generate a knowledge-based stockyard layout...|$|E

As an initial stage, a detailed layout for the precast concrete production processes is developed {{in order to understand the}} relationships amongst the manufacturing processes in such industry. In addition, simulation methodology is developed to analyse the precast manufacturing system and identify the resource bottlenecks.

40|$|The <b>concrete</b> {{building}} <b>products</b> manufacturing <b>industry</b> supplies 2, 000 - 4, 000 precast <b>concrete</b> building <b>products</b> to {{the construction}} industry. Owing to seasonal demand, the industry builds up stock in winter to meet the high demand in summer. As <b>concrete</b> <b>products</b> are heavy and vary in shape and size, proper stocking in terms of layout and methods of stocking of products on the yard is essential. Industrial practice suggests that stockyard space management gets less attention during strategic and budget planning as it is left to the stockyard manager. The industry experiences space congestion for both the storage and dispatch of products. During dispatch process, greater retrieval time is required, long queues of lorries (shipping vehicles) are formed and desired level of service cannot be maintained. Presents a review of stockyard operations, analysis of parameters affecting loading and dispatch process on the yard and strategies to optimise the stockyard layout.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The precast <b>concrete</b> <b>products</b> <b>industry</b> {{supplies}} 2, 000 to 4, 000 {{of different}} {{products to the}} construction industry. The demand for the products is seasonal. The industry builds up the stock in winter to meet the high demand in summer. As large numbers of products varying sizes and weights are involved, different handling and stacking requirements, the process of deciding appropriate locations to stock the products and track them while loading into lorries for dispatch becomes complex. Due to lack of appropriate methodology to manage stockyard layout, the industry experiences space congestion for both the storage and dispatch of products on the yard. During dispatch process, greater retrieval time is required, long queues of lorries (shipping vehicles) are formed, and desired level of service cannot be maintained. This paper describes an ongoing research that addresses the stockyard layout management problem through development of a simulation model, which investigates the effects of using different layout scenarios and handling equipment {{on the performance of}} stockyard. A prototype model is being developed using ARENA/SIMAN, a general-purpose simulation language. The model integrates production and forecast schedules, evaluates “what-if ” scenarios with different layout, product allocation to storage locations and order picking policies. The performance of stockyard is evaluated through vehicle waiting time, vehicle queue lengths, stockyard space utilisation and the cost of storage and dispatch of products.

40|$|The {{demand for}} the {{concrete}} products is seasonal and huge stock is built in winter for dispatch in summer. As 1000 - 2000 products with different sizes, weights, handling and stacking requirements are involved, the process of deciding appropriate locations to stock the products and track them while loading into lorries for dispatch becomes complex. Stockyards in the precast <b>concrete</b> <b>products</b> <b>industry</b> are experiencing space congestion, and long vehicle waiting times for both the storage and retrieval of concrete products {{due to lack of}} a proper methodology to manage stockyard layouts and their operations. This paper describes an ongoing research that addresses the stockyard layout management problem through the development of an integrated simulation and visualisation model. The paper focuses {{on the development of the}} visualisation and simulation element of the stockyard management system "SimStock". The simulation model has been developed using ARENA/SIMAN, a general-purpose simulation language. The simulation model integrates production and forecast schedules, evaluates "what-if" scenarios with different layouts, products allocation to storage locations and order picking policies. The output of the simulation model is recorded in a database (Ms Access). The visualisation model was developed through integrating AutoCAD 2000 with the database of the simulation model such that the simulated layouts can be studied in greater details and validated in a simpler manner. The visualisation module is used to assist managers in designing stock layouts (one of the major inputs to the simulation model) and visualise the simulation process in 2 D (and 3 D) perspectives, and manage real time implementation of proposed stockyard solutions...|$|E
40|$|The Yorkshire and Humber Regional Assembly and the Yorkshire and the Humber Regional Aggregates Working Party (RAWP) {{are seeking}} {{assistance}} in analysing the likely {{environmental impacts of}} meeting additional sand and gravel extraction {{and the ability of}} aggregate producing areas in the region to absorb such impacts. Although the region has adequate permitted reserves to meet the crushed rock guideline figure to 2016, a sand and gravel shortfall is anticipated, in particular, concreting aggregate. The Yorkshire and Humber Assembly commissioned the British Geological Survey to carry out a study to identify the broad areas of sand and gravel resources in the region and to further identify potentially suitable resources for use in the <b>concrete</b> <b>products</b> <b>industry.</b> In addition, information on the environmental and cultural assets and planning considerations associated with these areas was requested. The project was carried out in three key stages. This report describes the methodology employed at each stage. The first stage of the study was concerned with resource identification, both the broad distribution of sand and gravel resources and those resources potentially suitable for concreting aggregate. The sand and gravel resources of the region can be broadly subdivided into river sand and gravel, sub-alluvial deposits, glaciofluvial deposits, glaciolacustrine deposits, blown sand, head gravel and beach sand and gravel. Of these, river sand and gravel, glaciofluvial deposits and sub-alluvial deposits have the greatest potential for use as concreting aggregate. These resources were, in turn, divided into inferred and indicated resources, reflecting differing degrees of geological assurance. It {{is important to note that}} the economic potential of specific sites can only be proved by a detailed evaluation programme. The second stage of the study identified the environmental and cultural assets and other features relevant to planning in the region. The identification of assets and planning features was undertaken in consultation with the Assembly. Only those assets available digitally were incorporated. The final stage of the study integrated the identified environmental and cultural assets into a composite assets layer termed an ‘environmental sensitivity layer’. This layer depicts areas of higher or lower sensitivity based on the number of environmental or cultural assets at a given location. Higher sensitivity does not necessarily mean an area will be unsuitable for aggregates development, just that there may be more to consider and more stakeholders to consult. The data compiled in all three stages of this study will provide essential baseline information for the next steps of the ODPM ‘Good Practice Guidance on the Environmental Appraisal of the Provision of Aggregates’ (ODPM, 2004). The guidance is a two stage, 10 step process and is an aid to decision makers evaluating various supply scenarios for aggregates at the strategic scale. The data from this project will provide a useful reference in any scenario testing of future aggregates provision as required by the ODPM guidance...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} study effects of incorporating fly ash into <b>concrete</b> <b>products.</b> Scope {{of this study}} were (1) hazard identification of fly ash (2) study on standard testing of various <b>concrete</b> <b>products</b> and (3) study on environmental impact assessment of <b>concrete</b> <b>products</b> mixed with fly ash. Various types of fly ash namely A, B, C and D were sampling from different power plants. Hazard identification of fly ash was analyzed in terms of total threshold limit concentration (TTLC) and soluble threshold limit concentration (STLC). It was found that concentrations of chromium, cadmium, lead, mercury, nickel, zinc, copper and arsenic passed the criteria of notification of the ministry of industry regarding disposal of wastes or unusable materials B. E. 2548 (2005) in appendix- 2. Three types of <b>concrete</b> <b>products</b> namely brick road, concrete block and ready mixed concrete were studied. Fly ash was used as cementitious materials to replace Portland cement at 10 % and 30 % mixture. <b>Concrete</b> <b>products</b> with proportion of fly ash showed lower compressive strengths during 28 days of curing times. However, increase of curing times showed higher compressive strengths for all types of <b>concrete</b> <b>products.</b> ANOVA analysis showed that different fly ash proportion and curing times had a significant effect on compressive strength. The method of CML 2 baseline 2000, SimaPro 7. 3 was used in environmental impact assessment. The functional unit was set up through working area of 1 m 3. It was found that <b>concrete</b> <b>products</b> mixed with fly ash showed lower environmental impact compared to <b>concrete</b> <b>products</b> without fly ash. Increasing proportion of fly ash showed decreased environmental impact. From ANOVA analysis, there was no significant effect of fly ash types on environmental impact reduction for all types of <b>concrete</b> <b>products.</b> However, % fly ash mixture showed significant effect on environmental impact reduction especially in terms of global warming. Decrease in global warming (GW) potential for block road, concrete block and ready mixed concrete with 10 % fly ash mixture were 6. 15 % - 6. 16 %, 8. 44 % - 8. 46 % and 9. 31 % - 9. 32 % whereas the <b>concrete</b> <b>products</b> with 30 % fly ash mixture were 18. 41 % - 18. 46 %, 25. 35 % - 25. 41 % and 25. 22 % - 25. 26 % respectively...|$|R
