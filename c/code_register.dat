50|$|RISC-V has no {{condition}} <b>code</b> <b>register</b> or carry bit. The designers {{believed that}} condition codes make fast CPUs more complex by forcing interactions between instructions in {{different stages of}} execution. This choice makes multiple-precision arithmetic more complex. Also, a few numerical tasks need more energy.|$|E
50|$|The R2000 {{could be}} booted either big-endian or little-endian. It had thirty-one 32-bit general purpose registers, but no {{condition}} <b>code</b> <b>register</b> (the designers {{considered it a}} potential bottleneck), a feature it shares with the AMD 29000 and the Alpha.

50|$|Additionally, {{there are}} {{electromechanical}} meters, like prepaid water meters and {{automatic meter reading}} meters. The latter integrates an electronic measurement component and a LCD with a mechanical water meter. Mechanical water meters normally use a reed switch, hall or photoelectric <b>coding</b> <b>register</b> as the signal output. After processing by the microcontroller unit (MCU) in the electronic module, the data are transmitted to the LCD or output to an information management system.|$|R
50|$|It {{should also}} be noted that {{condition}} <b>code</b> <b>register</b> (CCR) affects the decryption process. For example, an arithmetic operation in the main program having the 0 number as a result, will cause zero flag bit to be set in CCR. This will cause the value in (SP) to be changed in the trace vector. This is also done to obfuscate against reverse engineering.|$|E
50|$|The ST7 has six registers: the accumulator, X and Y index registers, stack pointer, program counter, and {{condition}} <b>code</b> <b>register.</b> Also, double-indirect addressing allows the zero page of RAM {{to serve as}} additional registers. An unusual but useful feature is that an interrupt pushes four of these registers on the stack (A and X {{as well as the}} usual PC and CC), and interrupt return restores them.|$|E
50|$|This {{instruction}} is sensitive {{because it allows}} access to the entire status register, which includes not only the condition codes but also the user/supervisor bit, interrupt level, and trace control. In most later family members, starting with the MC68010, the MOVE from SR instruction was made privileged, and a new MOVE from CCR instruction was provided to allow access to the condition <b>code</b> <b>register</b> only.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This brief {{proposes a}} new class of hybrid VLSI ar-chitectures for {{survivor}} path processing to be used in Viterbi de-coders. The architecture combines the benefits of register exchange and traceforward algorithms, that is, low storage requirement and latency versus implementation efficiency. Based on a structural comparison, it becomes evident that the architecture can be ef-ficiently applied to codes with a larger number of states where traceback-based architectures, which increase latency, are usually dominant.

40|$|Trade-offs between <b>code</b> selection, <b>register</b> allocation, and {{instruction}} scheduling are inherently interdependent, especially when compiling for fine-grain parallel architectures. However, the conventional approach to compiling for such machines arbitrarily separates these phases so that decisions made during any one phase place unnecessary {{constraints on the}} remaining phases. Mutation Scheduling attempts {{to solve this problem}} by combining <b>code</b> selection, <b>register</b> allocation, {{and instruction}} scheduling into a unified framework in which trade-offs between the functional, register, and memory bandwidth resources of the target architecture are made "on the fly" in response to changing resource constraints and availability...|$|R
50|$|In the x86 {{processor}} line, {{a typical}} pre-486 CPU {{did not have}} an individual register file, as all general purpose register were directly work with its decoder, and the x87 push stack was located within the floating-point unit itself. Starting with Pentium, a typical Pentium-compatible x86 processor is integrated with one copy of the single-port architectural register file containing 8 architectural registers, 8 control registers, 8 debug <b>registers,</b> 8 condition <b>code</b> <b>registers,</b> 8 unnamed based register, one instruction pointer, one flag register and 6 segment registers in one file.|$|R

50|$|Like all Motorola {{processors}} {{that share}} lineage from the 6800, {{they use the}} von Neumann architecture as well as memory-mapped I/O. This family has five CPU registers that {{are not part of}} the memory: an 8-bit accumulator A, an 8-bit index register X, an 8-bit stack pointer SP with two most significant bits hardwired to 1, a 13-bit program counter PC, and an 8-bit condition <b>code</b> <b>register</b> CCR.|$|E
