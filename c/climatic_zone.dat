25|$|Considering its {{relatively}} small area, Bulgaria has variable and complex climate. The country occupies the southernmost {{part of the}} continental <b>climatic</b> <b>zone,</b> with small areas in the south falling within the Mediterranean <b>climatic</b> <b>zone.</b> The continental zone is predominant, because continental air masses flow easily into the unobstructed Danubian Plain. The continental influence, stronger during the winter, produces abundant snowfall; the Mediterranean influence increases {{during the second half}} of summer and produces hot and dry weather. Bulgaria is subdivided into five climatic zones: continental zone (Danubian Plain, Pre-Balkan and the higher valleys of the Transitional geomorphological region); transitional zone (Upper Thracian Plain, most of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the lower Sub-Balkan valleys); continental-Mediterranean zone (the southernmost areas of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the eastern Rhodope Mountains, Sakar and Strandzha); Black Sea zone along the coastline with an average length of 30–40km inland; and alpine zone in the mountains above 1000m altitude (central Balkan Mountains, Rila, Pirin, Vitosha, western Rhodope Mountains, etc.).|$|E

25|$|Ecological {{succession}} {{is generally}} {{defined as the}} successive occupation of a site by different plant communities. In an accreting mudflats the outer community along the sequence represents the pioneer community which is gradually replaced by the next community representing the seral stages and finally by a climax community typical of the <b>climatic</b> <b>zone.</b> Robert Scott Troup suggested that succession began in the newly accreted land created by fresh deposits of eroded soil. The pioneer vegetation on these newly accreted sites is Sonneratia, followed by Avicennia and Nypa. As the ground is elevated {{as a result of}} soil deposition, other trees make their appearance. The most prevalent, though one of the late species to appear, is Excoecaria. As the level of land rises through accretion and the land is only occasionally flooded by tides, Heritiera fomes begins to appear.|$|E

Due to its size, diverse topography, maritime location and most importantly having a coastline to two different bodies of water {{to the north and}} south, Istanbul exhibits microclimates. The northern half of the city, as well as the Bosporus coastline, express characteristics of oceanic and humid subtropical climates, because of humidity from the Black Sea and the relatively high concentration of vegetation.

The annual precipitation in the northern half can be twice as much (Bahçeköy, 1166.6mm), {{than it is in the}} southern, Marmara coast (Florya 635.0mm).

Major soil group-distribution model relationships on a world level seem to follow more equitable patterns than those established for biocenoses and soil patterns at fine scales. At a continental level, the pedosphere’s diversity is characterized by similarities rather than differences. Differences in diversity by <b>climatic</b> <b>zones</b> are more marked. Evenness (Pielou’s index) and diversity (Shannon’s index) tend to be greater in the <b>climatic</b> <b>zones</b> of intermediate latitudes than in circumequatorial and circumboreal latitudes. The <b>climatic</b> <b>zones</b> closest to the Poles could be the planet’s most uniform soil patterns at small scales. Mountain areas, in general, achieve the highest pedorichness and lowest values of diversity. Global soil pattern distribution was also analyzed using multivariate techniques. At a continental level, it is possible for the structure of the global pedosphere to be determined by the continent’s geological, tectonic and climatic histories. Soil patterns of different <b>climatic</b> <b>zones</b> are linked in a very well-defined latitudinal gradient...|$|R
