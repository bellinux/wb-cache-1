5|$|The Chumscrubber is a 2005 American-German comedy-drama film, {{directed}} by Arie Posin, starring an ensemble cast led by Jamie Bell.

Some of the themes addressed in the film are the lack of communication between teenagers and their parents and the inauthenticity of suburbia.

Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia, and the local authorities begin to incite Višegrad's non-Serb population against the town's Serb residents.

Austria-Hungary's invasion is swiftly repulsed and the Serbians advance across the Drina, prompting the Austro-Hungarians to evacuate Višegrad and destroy portions of the bridge.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{deaths from}} {{smallpox}} often changed dynastic succession. The only surviving son of Henry VIII, Edward VI, died from complications shortly after apparently {{recovering from the}} disease, thereby nullifying Henry's efforts to ensure a male successor to the throne (his two immediate successors were both women, who had both had it and survived). Louis XV of France succeeded his great-grandfather Louis XIV {{through a series of}} deaths of smallpox or measles among those earlier in the succession line. He himself died of the disease in 1774. William III lost his mother to the disease when he was only ten years old in 1660, and named his uncle Charles as legal guardian: her death from smallpox would indirectly spark a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> would eventually lead to the permanent ousting of the Stuart line from the British throne. William III's wife, Mary II of England, died from smallpox as well.|$|E
5|$|As a {{delegate}} for the Junta, {{he led the}} ill-fated Paraguay campaign. His troops were defeated by Bernardo de Velasco at the battles of Campichuelo and Paraguarí. Though he was defeated, the campaign initiated the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> led to the Independence of Paraguay in May 1811. He retreated to the vicinity of Rosario, to fortify it against a possible royalist attack from the Eastern Band of the Uruguay River. While there, he created the flag of Argentina. The First Triumvirate did not approve the flag, but because of slow communications, Belgrano would only learn of that many weeks later, while reinforcing the Army of the North at Jujuy. There, knowing {{he was at a}} strategic disadvantage against the royalist armies coming from Upper Peru, Belgrano ordered the Jujuy Exodus, which evacuated the entire population of Jujuy Province to San Miguel de Tucumán. His counter-offensive at the Battle of Tucumán resulted in a key strategic victory, and it was soon followed by a complete victory over the royalist army of Pío Tristán at the Battle of Salta. However, his deeper incursions into Upper Perú led to defeats at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, leading the Second Triumvirate to order his replacement as Commander of the Army of the North by the newly arrived José de San Martín. By then, the Asamblea del Año XIII had approved the use of Belgrano's flag as the national war flag.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Game-based {{learning}} environments often {{make use of}} pre-scripted scenarios to present educational and training content. However, a one-size-fits-all scenario may not address all of the abilities, needs, or goals of a particular learner. This paper presents a methodology for automatically adapting a game scenario to better suit such requirements. We describe initial steps toward an intelligent technology called a Scenario Adaptor that employs planning-like algorithms to add or remove events from a scenario that relate to learning objectives. The Scenario Adaptor attempts to “re-write ” scenarios {{in order for the}} learner to achieve the desired set of learner-specific learning objectives. Scenario cohesion is maintained by integrating causal <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> lead to the scenario’s outcome.

40|$|Fluctuations of {{work-in-progress}} (WIP) levels cause {{variability of}} cycle time and {{often lead to}} productivity losses in semiconductor wafer fabrication plants. To identify sources of such variability, we are developing a root cause analysis tool with history logs <b>of</b> operational <b>events,</b> such as high WIP or equipment downtime, as inputs to automatically find the <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> create the variability. In the root cause analysis, {{one of the key}} steps is to aggregate the observed <b>events</b> into groups <b>that</b> are likely in cause-effect relationships. For operational <b>events</b> <b>that</b> involve time lags in cause-effect relationships, grouping the <b>events</b> requires identification <b>of</b> the time windows of causality based on discrete event simulations.

Furthermore, we show that if the bug is not corrected during system development, CrystalBall is effective in steering the execution away from inconsistent states at runtime...|$|R

30|$|Finally, the {{proposed}} ROIA {{is based on}} a model in which time is represented by fixed timeslices, where each timeslice is independent of each other. This implies that an impact of, e.g., the first timeslice is not considered anymore in the impact assessment of the second timeslice. To overcome this characteristic, the local impact probabilities must be adequately designed, as, e.g., proposed throughout this article. Another possibility is to utilize a time-dependent model, where the respective model of a timeslice t is dependent on nodes of the model representing timeslice t− 1. Doing so creates a form of a dynamic Bayesian networks in which a near-realtime analysis of impacts is provided. Furthermore, such a network allows one to analyze <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> lead to an impact in retrospective. The design and mathematical implications of such a time-dependent dynamic impact assessment is considered by Motzek et al. in [11] utilizing so-called activator dynamic Bayesian networks [49].|$|R
