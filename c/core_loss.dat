40|$|The {{prediction}} of {{switched reluctance motor}} (SRM) performance requires knowledge of <b>core</b> <b>losses.</b> However, the calculation of iron losses in SRM is especially complex first because the flux waveforms are nonsinusoidal and {{different parts of the}} magnetic circuit have different waveforms and second because they are conditioned by the type of control used. This study proposes an analytical method for calculating <b>core</b> <b>losses</b> that comprises simulation of the SRM using finite element analysis to determine the magnetization curves, and SRM modeling, which enables transient simulations with the associated electronic power converter run under different control strategies. The flux density waveforms in the different parts of the SRM are derived from the flux density waveform of the stator pole that is obtained from the transient simulation. The specific <b>core</b> <b>losses</b> (in W/kg) are separated into three parts (hysteresis losses, classical eddy current losses and excess losses) and calculated using the waveforms and time derivatives of the local flux density. The <b>core</b> <b>losses</b> for each part of the SRM’s magnetic circuit can be estimated using the calculated values for specific hysteresis losses, specific classical eddy current losses and specific excess losses for each zone. Adding these individual losses yields the total <b>core</b> <b>losses.</b> The method was applied to three-phase 6 / 4 SRM, and the calculated results were compared with experimentally obtained measurements.

5000|$|The {{parallel}} shunt component on {{the equivalent}} circuit diagram {{is used to}} represent the <b>core</b> <b>losses.</b> These <b>core</b> <b>losses</b> come from {{the change in the}} direction of the flux and eddy currents.

The Heyland diagram is an approximate representation of circle diagram applied to induction motors, which assumes that stator input voltage, rotor resistance and rotor reactance are constant and stator resistance and <b>core</b> <b>loss</b> are zero.

50|$|In a {{transformer}} the no load loss {{is dominated by}} the <b>core</b> <b>loss.</b> With an amorphous core, this can be 70-80% lower than with traditional crystalline materials.The loss under heavy load {{is dominated by the}} resistance of the copper windings and thus called copper loss. Here the lower saturation magnetization of amorphous cores tend to result in a lower efficiency at full load. Using more copper and core material it is possible to compensate for this. So high efficiency AMTs can be more efficient at low and high load, though at a larger size. The more expensive amorphous core material, the more difficult handling and the need for more copper windings make an AMT more expensive than a traditional transformer.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} <b>core</b> <b>losses</b> in induction motors running under different loading conditions. The investigation is conducted using 2 -D finite-element methods incorporating two different core-loss models. The simplified model disregards the minor loops and skin {{effect in the}} lamination. The second approach solves the magneto-dynamic problem in the lamination taking hysteresis and viscosity effects into account. The simulation {{results show that the}} <b>core</b> <b>losses</b> increase significantly with loading and the effect of slot harmonics on the eddy-current loss and minor loops can be remarkable. The distribution of the fluxes change dramatically with loading, leading to an overall increase in the harmonic content and a general decrease in the amplitude of the fundamental flux components. Therefore, even though the fundamental flux components decrease by increasing the load, the <b>core</b> <b>losses</b> rise {{as a result of the}} increase in the flux distortions and higher harmonics...|$|R

50|$|Scanning {{confocal}} {{electron energy}} loss microscopy (SCEELM) {{is a new}} analytical microscopy tool that enables a double corrected transmission electron microscope to achieve sub-10 nm depth resolution in depth sectioning imaging of nanomaterials. It was previously termed as energy filtered scanning confocal electron microscopy {{due to the lack}} to full spectrum acquisition capability (only a small energy window on the order of 5 eV can be used at a time). SCEELM takes advantages of the newly developed chromatic aberration corrector which allows electrons of more than 100 eV of energy spread to be focused to roughly the same focal plane. It has been demonstrated that a simultaneous acquisition of the zero loss, low-loss, and <b>core</b> <b>loss</b> signals up to 400 eV in the confocal geometry with depth discrimination capability.|$|E
50|$|The EMF of a {{transformer}} {{at a given}} flux density increases with frequency. By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed {{to achieve the same}} impedance. However, properties such as <b>core</b> <b>loss</b> and conductor skin effect also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400 Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight. Conversely, frequencies used for some railway electrification systems were much lower (e.g. 16.7 Hz and 25 Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50-60 Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early electric traction motors. Consequently, the transformers used to step-down the high overhead line voltages (e.g. 15 kV) were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies.|$|E
50|$|Silicon {{significantly}} {{increases the}} electrical resistivity of the steel, which decreases the induced eddy currents and narrows the hysteresis loop of the material, thus lowering the <b>core</b> <b>loss.</b> However, the grain structure hardens and embrittles the metal, which adversely affects the workability of the material, especially when rolling it. When alloying, the concentration levels of carbon, sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen {{must be kept}} low, as these elements indicate the presence of carbides, sulfides, oxides and nitrides. These compounds, even in particles as small as one micrometer in diameter, increase hysteresis losses while also decreasing magnetic permeability. The presence of carbon has a more detrimental effect than sulfur or oxygen. Carbon also causes magnetic aging when it slowly leaves the solid solution and precipitates as carbides, thus resulting {{in an increase in}} power loss over time. For these reasons, the carbon level is kept to 0.005% or lower. The carbon level can be reduced by annealing the steel in a decarburizing atmosphere, such as hydrogen.|$|E
