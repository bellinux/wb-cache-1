They {{are used in}} industry for cutting and drilling, and in military as directed-energy weapons. The first <b>chemical</b> <b>laser</b> was co-invented by Jerome V. V. Kasper and George C.

25|$|A {{chemical}} oxygen iodine laser is {{an infrared}} <b>chemical</b> <b>laser.</b> The chemical oxygen iodine laser {{was invented by}} the United States Air Force's Phillips Laboratory in 1977 for military purposes. Its properties make it useful for industrial processing as well; the beam is focusable and can be transferred by an optical fiber, as its wavelength is not absorbed much by fused silica but is very well absorbed by metals, making it suitable for laser cutting and drilling. COIL is the main weapon laser for the military airborne laser and advanced tactical laser programs.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1985, the Air Force tested an SDIO-funded {{deuterium}} fluoride laser known as Mid-Infrared Advanced <b>Chemical</b> <b>Laser</b> (MIRACL) at White Sands Missile Range. During a simulation, the laser successfully destroyed a Titan missile booster in 1985, however the test setup had the booster shell pressurized and under considerable compression loads. [...] These test conditions {{were used to}} simulate the loads a booster would be under during launch. The system was later tested on target drones simulating cruise missiles for the US Navy, with some success. After the SDIO closed, the MIRACL was tested on an old Air Force satellite for potential use as an anti-satellite weapon, with mixed results. The technology was also used to develop the Tactical High Energy Laser, (THEL) which is being tested to shoot down artillery shells.|$|E
2500|$|Secretary of Defense Gates {{summarized}} fundamental {{concerns with}} the practicality {{of the program}} concept: [...] "I don't know anybody at the Department of Defense, Mr. Tiahrt, who thinks that this program should, or would, ever be operationally deployed. The reality is that you would need a laser something like 20 to 30 times {{more powerful than the}} <b>chemical</b> <b>laser</b> in the plane right now {{to be able to get}} any distance from the launch site to fire....So, right now the ABL would have to orbit inside the borders of Iran in order to be able to try and use its laser to shoot down that missile in the boost phase. And if you were to operationalize this you would be looking at 10 to 20 747s, at a billion and a half dollars apiece, and $100 million a year to operate. And there's nobody in uniform that I know who believes that this is a workable concept." ...|$|E
