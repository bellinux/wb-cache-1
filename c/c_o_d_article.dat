The curing of flock adhcsives and the graft modification of fibers and filaments for bulk and surface property enhancement are described as typical of thc high speed performance available with modern electron beam equip-ment. Applications of ultraviolet curing to bonding enhancement on textiles and to surface coating such as leather and man-made fabrics, are reviewed. At the present time, the adoption of this non-polluting technology is particulady active in the printing industry as tougher pollution control legislation takes effect. Some data on its healthy growth rates worldwide arc reviewed, and its importance for energy in-tensive industries, such as textile finishing, is discussed. THE RADIATION SOURCES HE MOST WIDELY used ultraviolet lamp is the quartz tube medium T pressure mercury vapor arc. It provides photon (light) emission between 240 and 280 nm (5. 2 and 4. 4 eV respectively) and between 350 and 390 (3. 5 and 3. 2 eV respectively), and it is these ultraviolet emissions which possess sufficient energy to interact directly with specific photo-active chemicals. These bulbs are made in lengths to approximately 2 meters and with di-ameters to 25 m. In order to provide a sufficiently intense W source, these tubes are operated at pressures of about 2 bars.
