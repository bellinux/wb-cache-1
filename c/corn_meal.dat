40|$|Abstract. US Patent No. 5, 030, 268 {{discloses}} that <b>corn</b> gluten <b>meal,</b> {{the protein}} fraction of corn (Zea mays L.) grain, {{can be used}} as a natural preemergence herbicide. However, <b>corn</b> gluten <b>meal</b> is insoluble in water, and this characteristic renders it difficult to apply as a herbicide. To seek a water soluble material with more potent herbicidal activity, the phytotoxicity of various samples derived from <b>corn</b> gluten <b>meal</b> and other related crop materials were evaluated by using three different grass species under controlled environments. Greenhouse and growth chamber bioassays showed that the sample of enzymatically hydrolyzed <b>corn</b> gluten <b>meal</b> was more herbicidally active than the corn gluten itself and was highly water soluble. Gluten hydrolysate prepared with bacterial source proteinase had the greatest inhibitory activity to the root growth of germinating seeds. This water-soluble material derived from <b>corn</b> gluten <b>meal</b> had a growth-regulating effect on the root system and {{can be used as}} a natural herbicide. The use of herbicides for weed control has been practiced to some extent since 1927. Synthetic and organic pesticides have become a major component of agricultural, forestry, and turfgrass management systems (Balogh and Anderson 1992).
