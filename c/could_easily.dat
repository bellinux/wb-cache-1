40|$|Diastereoselective {{introduction}} of phosphono groups into l-proline derivatives at the 5 -position was achieved with suitable selection of N-protecting group. N-Benzoyl-l-prolinate preferentially gave trans-phosphorylated products, which <b>could</b> be <b>easily</b> transformed into (S) -(pyrrolidin- 2 -yl) phosphonates. On the other hand, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-prolinate reacted with phosphite to give cis-substituted products, which <b>could</b> be <b>easily</b> transformed into (R) -(pyrrolidin- 2 -yl) phosphonates...|$|R
5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one sat down in the pit, one <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> miss the subtleties of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E
5|$|Bates leaves Obydos; {{he finds}} the people lazy, as {{otherwise}} they <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> become comfortable with mixed farming. They sail through a tremendous storm. He finds a Pterochroza grasshopper whose forewings perfectly resemble leaves, the Victoria waterlily, masses of ticks, the howler monkey and large Morpho butterflies. He meets Wallace again at Barra. Back in Para, he catches yellow fever.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{population}} size would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty period, when the population doubled to 100 million {{people because of}} extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with rural farmers holding more abundant yields of food that they <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> provide to the growing market.|$|E

5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> hear them play. Young men would gather around the gandingan and gossip about people they dislike, usually “chatting” with other gandingan players further away.

5|$|Proximal {{volcanic}} hazards pose {{a significant}} threat {{to human life}} near Gareloi. If Gareloi were to erupt unexpectedly, ash clouds, falling volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows, and debris avalanches (such as lahars) <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> span deadly hazards such as tsunamis. As volcanic ash can induce engine failure, it puts commercial airplanes in particular at high risk. Inhalation of volcanic ash, also known as tephra, creates respiratory complexities and irritation of the eye.|$|E

5|$|Smythe was an NHL owner {{during the}} era before the player's union. The NHL was only six teams and players who didn't toe the line <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be demoted to {{the minor leagues}} and a {{replacement}} found.

Two players, Danny Lewicki and John McCormack were both demoted to the minors for getting married without Smythe's permission.|$|E

5|$|A paper {{documenting the}} {{discovery}} was {{prepared by the}} team {{and sent to the}} journal Physical Review in March 1941, but publication was delayed until a year after the end of World War II due to security concerns. At the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product. They calculated that element 94 would be fissile, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium, and <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be separated from it.|$|E
5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
