40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the ca-pability of axisymmetric swirling flow models to correctly reproduce the flow features in the draft tube <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> a <b>pump</b> turbine. Time averaged PIV velocity measurements for three operating points (part load, best efficiency, over load) are used to assess the accuracy of the numerical results. It is shown that the axisymmetric swirling flow model can capture both flow detachment from the cone wall, at low swirl levels, {{and the development of a}} large quasi-stagnant region in the center, at high swirl levels. A brief analysis of the accuracy of turbine flow simu-lations reveals the difficulties in accurately estimate the swirl level downstream the turbine runner, particu-larly for low specific speed machines. The numerical simulations favorably compare with experimental data at part load and best efficiency operating points. However, it is shown that the inlet boundary condi-tions used at the over load point significantly under-estimate the swirl level. As a result, we conclude that accurate swirling flow numerical results heavily rely on the draft tube cone inlet boundary conditions corresponding to the swirling flow downstream the turbine runner blades...|$|R
50|$|Water levels or {{pressures}} can be contoured {{similar to}} elevation on topographic maps. Contour maps often show “bulls-eyes” around pumped wells {{that represent the}} <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> depression.

40|$|The {{potentiometric}} {{surface of}} the Middendorf aquifer for November and December 2009 shows that the generally southeastward ground-water flow is affected by several potentiometric lows.

30|$|The {{equipotential}} {{lines of}} {{the central part of}} MAIWF as shown in Fig.  8 are curved in an open trench with flow from all directions especially in the area of Gabal El-Hadid City (Fig.  8). This may be attributed to the concentration of wells in these parts with heavy uncontrolled pumping (more than 1, 200 production wells). This open trench with flow from all directions appears at all time intervals related to the three proposed scenarios. But it divides into <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> depressions as a result <b>of</b> heavy <b>pumping</b> (Fig.  8).
