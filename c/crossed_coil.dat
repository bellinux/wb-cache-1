Part of the NED activities is a design study of different possible dipole configurations which is shared amongst the collaborating institutes. This thesis covers the electromagnetic design study of an 88 mm large bore superconducting 15 T dipole magnet with a <b>coil</b> <b>cross</b> section in cos-theta-layer design. Based on analytically describable geometries the sources of multipole errors are studied and elementary estimations of the magnet are carried out, e. g., the required amount of superconductors or the influence of the iron yoke thickness on the field quality. The magnet cross section for NED is optimized by means of the CERN field computation program ROXIE. The preliminary NED design serves as starting point for the <b>coil</b> <b>cross</b> section optimization with respect to field quality and a radial positioning of the conductor blocks. Due to the high field of magnetic induction, the surrounding iron yoke saturates for high transport currents and the multipole errors vary with excitation. In order to reduce the variation, modifications of the iron yoke shape are studied, like, e. g., holes punched into the yoke laminations, a change of the outer yoke contour or an inner contour of elliptical shape. For an elliptically shaped inner iron yoke contour the <b>coil</b> <b>cross</b> section is again optimized resulting in the Reference Design V. 2 for the NED collaboration.

40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} {{performances}} of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils, {{it is necessary to}} store more energy within a shorter HTS tape length and to reduce leakage magnetic fields. To attain these goals, we need to increase the critical current of the coil. The critical currents and n-values of the HTS tape generally depend on the magnitudes and angles of the applied magnetic field. Therefore, we calculated the transport current performances of HTS coils with anisotropic properties. In general, anisotropy generates relatively large electric fields at the coil edges, limiting the transport current performances of the coil. To solve this problem, we proposed a new symmetric, lattice shaped HTS <b>coil</b> <b>cross</b> sections. The <b>coil</b> assembly consists of small ring-shaped <b>coils</b> of rectangular <b>cross</b> section forming pairs of Helmholtz coils. As a result, the angle between the magnetic field and tape and electric fields decreased, resulting in an increase in the critical current of the coil.

Furthermore, the leakage magnetic field was substantially reduced...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study is to harvest 1 mW energy with a Brooks coil 2 cm in diameter from environmental magnetic field at 60 Hz.

40|$|Constitutional {{heterozygous}} loss-of-function {{mutations in}} the SPRED 1 gene cause a phenotype known as Legius syndrome, {{which consists of}} symptoms of multiple cafe-au-lait macules, axillary freckling, learning disabilities and macrocephaly. Legius syndrome resembles a mild neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) phenotype. It has been demonstrated that SPRED 1 functions as a negative regulator of the RAS-ERK pathway and interacts with neurofibromin, the NF 1 gene product. However, the molecular details of this interaction {{and the effects of}} the mutations identified in Legius syndrome and NF 1 on this interaction have not yet been investigated. In this study, using a yeast two-hybrid system and an immunoprecipitation assay in HEK 293 cells, we found that the SPRED 1 EVH 1 domain interacts with the N-terminal 16 amino acids (aa) and the C-terminal 20 aa of the GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP) -related domain (GRD) of neurofibromin, which form two <b>crossing</b> α-helix <b>coils</b> outside the GAP domain. These regions {{have been shown to be}} dispensable for GAP activity and are not present in p 120 GAP. Several mutations in these N- and C-terminal regions of the GRD in NF 1 patients and pathogenic missense mutations in the EVH 1 domain of SPRED 1 in Legius syndrome reduced the binding affinity between the EVH 1 domain and the GRD. EVH 1 domain mutations with reduced binding to the GRD also disrupted the ERK suppression activity of SPRED 1. These data clearly demonstrate that SPRED 1 inhibits the Ras-ERK pathway by recruiting neurofibromin to Ras through the EVH 1 -GRD interaction, and this study also provides molecular basis for the pathogenic mutations of NF 1 and Legius syndrome. status: publishe...|$|R

Inductive power transfer {{can be used as}} a power delivery method for a variety of portable devices, from medical implants to electric vehicles and is gaining increased interest. The focus is on high quality factor coils and MHz operation, where accurate measurements are difficult to achieve. Fast models of all pertinent aspects of inductive power transfer systems for constant <b>cross</b> section <b>coils</b> are developed. These models are used to optimise a new coil winding pattern that aims to increase efficiency in volume constrained scenarios. Measurement systems are developed to measure coil Q factors in excess of 1, 000. The prototype measurement systems are verified against models of that system, as well as finite element simulations of the coil under test. Shielding of inductive power transfer systems is then investigated. A structure typically used at GHz frequencies, the artificial magnetic conductor, is miniaturised as an alternative to conventional ferrite backed ground plane shielding. Finite element simulation shows this structure significantly improves link efficiency. The artificial magnetic conductor prototype does not result in a gain in efficiency expected, however it does display the properties expected of an artificial magnetic conductor, including increased coupling factor. Finally, an unconventional inductive power transfer system is presented where transmitter and receiver are up to 6 m away from each other and of radically different size. This system provides mW level power to remote devices in a room, for example thermostats or e-ink displays. Conventional approaches to design do not consider the distortion of the magnetic field caused by metallic objects in the room.

Various electromagnetic analyses have been performed to determine the electromagnetic loadings that the coils will experience during normal operating conditions, plasma disruptions, and fault conditions.

The objective {{is to provide a}} powerful insight into {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the different topologies, and to establish some design guidelines for selecting an appropriate direct drive SC generator for offshore wind turbine applications. Firstly, the structures of the three SC generator topologies are introduced. Then, the influence of the SC <b>coil</b> <b>cross</b> sectional area on torque capability is compared. After that, three SC generators with different topologies are optimized respectively for further comparison, including the active material cost, weight, harmonics in the electromotive force (EMF), torque ripple, field harmonics in the SC coil, and forces on the rotor and stator components, etc. It is found that, with the same SC quantity, the torque capability of the iron-cored stator and rotor topology is much better than that of the other two topologies. However, the advantage becomes less significant when a larger area of the SC coil is employed. The air gap flux density waveform of the ASART is much smoother than those of the ISIRT and ISART. The torque ripples of the ISIRT and the ISART are much higher than that of the ASART. The field harmonics (both amplitude and frequency) in the SC coil of the ASART are the lowest. For the ISIRT, most of the force on the rotor is acting on the rotor iron, and thus, the SC coil is more likely to be safe from a mechanical performance point of view and the design of the corresponding supporting structure is simple. However, for the air-cored rotor topologies, nearly all the force is acting on the SC coil. For the air-cored stator, the force mainly acts on the armature winding, while for the iron-cored stator, it is mainly on the stator teeth. Due to the excellent mechanical performance of iron, the iron-cored stator is therefore more robust. ...|$|R

Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the pulsed induction motor and to collect data {{that could be used}} for scaling calculations. A 14. 4 kg aluminum plate was accelerated down a 4 m track to speeds of over 15 m/sec with peak thrust up to 18 kN per coilset.

Two power cars, one at each end of the train, provide 6 MW from two gas turbine prime power units. The thrust is about 210. 000 N and is essentially constant up to 200 km/hr since wheel slippage does not limit thrust as with conventional wheeled propulsion. A key component of the SERAPHIM concept is the use of passive wheel-on-rah support for the high speed vehicle. Standard steel wheels are capable of handling over 200 mph.
