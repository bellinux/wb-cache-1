25|$|Regurgitation {{is the sum}} of {{retrograde}} flow {{during the}} <b>closing</b> <b>motion</b> of the valve and leakage flow after closure. It is directly proportional to valve size and is also dependent on valve type. Typically, caged-ball valves have a low amount of regurgitation as there is very little leakage. Tilting-disc and bileaflet valves are comparable, with the bileaflet valves have a slightly larger regurgitation volume. Bioprosthetics prevail over MHV in this case, as they have virtually no regurgitation volume.|$|E
50|$|A {{study by}} Hayward {{found that the}} termini of α-helices and β-sheets form hinges in {{a large number of}} cases. Many hinges were found to involve two {{secondary}} structure elements acting like hinges of a door, allowing an opening and <b>closing</b> <b>motion</b> to occur. This can arise when two neighbouring strands within a β-sheet situated in one domain, diverge apart as they join the other domain. The two resulting termini then form the bending regions between the two domains. α-helices that preserve their hydrogen bonding network when bent are found to behave as mechanical hinges, storing `elastic energy' that drives the closure of domains for rapid capture of a substrate.|$|E

5000|$|Another type {{of rolling}} machine, {{manufactured}} {{by at least}} one company, is less commonly seen, but easier to use than the dual-wheel variety. In a [...] "rolling box", a belt of material is exposed by opening the rolling box. The lower portion of the belt can be expanded against a curved tray component, and the tray filled with the material that one wishes to roll a cigarette or joint out of. A piece of rolling paper is then placed behind the material, against the belt material, with the gummed side at the top and facing outwards. As the box is slowly closed, a bar lifts the belt material up against the material to be rolled, simultaneously pressing it against the rolling paper and packing it more tightly, and also causing the portion of the belt with the lower edge of the rolling paper to roll around outwards, forming the cigarette or joint.

With a two-dimensional square-lattice array of these resonators formed of gold on a glass substrate, we monitor the visible-pump-pulse induced gigahertz oscillations in intensity of reflected linearly-polarized infrared probe light pulses, modulated by the resonators effectively acting as miniature tuning forks. A multimodal vibrational response involving the opening and <b>closing</b> <b>motion</b> of the split rings is detected in this way. Numerical simulations of the associated transient deformations and strain fields elucidate the complex nanomechanical dynamics contributing to the ultrafast optical modulation, and point to the role of acousto-plasmonic interactions through the opening and <b>closing</b> <b>motion</b> of the SRR gaps as the dominant effect.

30|$|As {{illustrated}} in Section 5 and the corpus studies in Section 6, unless {{one of the}} two morphemes is 到 dao ‘arrive’, two <b>closed</b> scale <b>motion</b> morphemes typically do not occur together in an MMMC. Both multi-point <b>closed</b> scale <b>motion</b> morphemes (e.g., 回 hui ‘return’) and two-point <b>closed</b> scale <b>motion</b> morphemes (e.g., 進 jin ‘enter’) are associated with a bounded scale. Although the two types of motion morphemes differ from each other as to whether they lexicalize a multi-point or two-point scale, morphemes of either type are able to express a single delimited motion event in which a moving object moves along a path in a certain direction to an endpoint. In other words, in terms of the degree of specification of a scale, a two-point <b>closed</b> scale <b>motion</b> morpheme is not more specific than a multi-point <b>closed</b> scale <b>motion</b> morpheme, or vice versa: both specify the existence of a scale and the existence of an endpoint for the scale.

40|$|New protein {{functions}} {{can require}} complex sequence changes, but the minimal path {{is not well}} understood. The guanylate kinase enzyme (GKenz), which catalyzes phosphotransfer from ATP to GMP, evolved into the GK domain (GKdom), a protein-binding domain found in membrane associate guanylate kinases that function in mitotic spindle orientation and cell adhesion. Using an induced polarity assay for GKdom function, we show that a single serine to proline mutation is sufficient to switch extant GKenz into a functional GKdom. The mutation blocks catalysis (GKenz function) but allows protein binding and spindle orientation (GKdom function). Furthermore, whereas the GKenz undergoes a large <b>closing</b> <b>motion</b> upon GMP binding, fluorescence quenching and NMR demonstrate that the S → P mutation inhibits GMP-induced GK movements. Disrupting GK closing with a mutation at a different position also leads to GKdom function, suggesting that blocking the GKenz <b>closing</b> <b>motion</b> is sufficient for functional conversion of GKenz to GKdom. Although subtle changes in protein function can require complex sequence paths, our work shows that entirely new functions can arise from single mutations that alter protein dynamics...|$|E

30|$|The {{temporal}} {{pattern of}} tricuspid valve closure, tricuspid annular and right ventricular contraction has, also due to shortcomings of current imaging modalities, never been investigated before. Right ventricular contraction and the <b>closing</b> <b>motion</b> of the tricuspid anterior leaflet occur simultaneously, whereas {{the reduction of}} the tricuspid septal-lateral diameter occurs about 150  ms later in the cardiac cycle when the leaflet is closed. It could therefore be speculated that the tricuspid leaflets have a sail like function [as suggested for the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve (Bothe et al. 2009)], where annular shortening occurs secondary to right ventricular contraction rather than being the result of an active annular contraction. If true, annular repair approaches should focus more on preserving valve function rather than preserving tricuspid annular contraction.|$|E

A method to obtain designs of these fingers capable of various behaviours during their <b>closing</b> <b>motions</b> is presented. The method is based on using triggered passive elements in carefully selected joints of the finger and the selection or optimization of geometric parameters to obtain particular kinematic relationships between the motions of the phalanges. This method is very general and can be applied to any self-adaptive robotic finger in order to obtain many different types of <b>closing</b> <b>motions.</b> Examples given in this paper are focusing on two different preshaping motions, the first one aims at allowing pinch grasps while the second mimics a human finger.

30|$|The {{hierarchy}} {{consists of}} the four scalar types of Chinese motion morphemes. It predicts that when semantically compatible (cf. Huang and Chang 1996) motion morphemes from different classes co-occur in a motion construction, they will tend to be ordered {{from left to right}} according to how their types appear in the hierarchy in 5. Because a multi-point and a two-point <b>closed</b> scale <b>motion</b> morpheme usually do not occur together in a motion construction and both occur in the same position in sequences of multiple motion morphemes, these two types are grouped together as one, i.e. <b>closed</b> scale <b>motion</b> morphemes, in the hierarchy. Note that 來 lai ‘come’ and 去 qu ‘go’ are frequently found after other <b>closed</b> scale <b>motion</b> morphemes such as 回 hui ‘return’, 進 jin ‘enter’, and 出 chu ‘exit’, but such 來 lai ‘come’ and 去 qu ‘go’ are no longer full-fledged multi-point <b>closed</b> scale <b>motion</b> morphemes (See more discussion in Section Motion morphemes from different scalar classes but in an order reverse to the Motion Morpheme Hierarchy). In addition, the two-point <b>closed</b> scale <b>motion</b> morpheme 到 dao ‘arrive’ is treated as a special motion morpheme and positioned in the rightmost of the hierarchy because it does not behave all the same with other motion morphemes such as 進 jin ‘enter’ and 出 chu ‘exit’ from the same type.

40|$|BackgroundResidual or {{recurrent}} mitral regurgitation frequently occurs after {{mitral valve}} repair for ischemic mitral regurgitation with an annuloplasty ring. Because annuloplasty primarily addresses annular dilatation, we studied an adjunctive technique that might correct restricted leaflet (Carpentier type IIIb) systolic <b>closing</b> <b>motion,</b> which often accompanies annular dilatation {{in patients with}} ischemic mitral regurgitation. MethodsSix sheep had radiopaque markers placed on the left ventricle, mitral leaflets and annulus, and mitral subvalvular apparatus. A pericardial patch was sutured into the middle scallop of the posterior mitral valve leaflet and furled in with a reefing stitch placed in the radial axis. Posterolateral left ventricular myocardial ischemia was created by using proximal circumflex occlusion to induce acute ischemic mitral regurgitation. Under open-chest conditions, 3 -dimensional marker coordinates were measured by using biplane videofluoroscopy at baseline and during acute ischemia {{both before and after}} release of the reefing stitch (leaflet extension); transesophageal echocardiography was used to grade ischemic mitral regurgitation. ResultsLeaflet apical systolic tethering was not improved by leaflet extension, but ischemic mitral regurgitation decreased (control, 0. 9 ± 0. 3 *; ischemia, 2. 4 ± 0. 3; leaflet extension, 1. 5 ± 0. 3; *P < 0. 002). Posterior mitral valve leaflet midline length (control, 1. 45 ± 0. 09 *; ischemia, 1. 53 ± 0. 10; leaflet extension, 1. 83 ± 0. 13 *; *P < 0. 001) and posterior mitral valve leaflet middle scallop area (control, 1. 66 ± 0. 20 cm 2 *; ischemia, 1. 91 ± 0. 22 cm 2; leaflet extension, 2. 36 ± 0. 22 cm 2 *; *P < 0. 006) increased with leaflet extension because of patch unfurling (mean ± 1 standard error of the mean; repeated-measures analysis of variance, Dunnet post-hoc test vs ischemia). ConclusionsPosterior mitral valve leaflet extension ameliorated acute ischemic mitral regurgitation but did not correct the abnormal apically restricted systolic posterior mitral valve leaflet <b>closing</b> <b>motion.</b> This technique might be a useful adjunct repair in combination with ring annuloplasty for ischemic mitral regurgitation, but the clinical role of this adjunct remains to be defined in patients...|$|E

30|$|Rappaport Hovav and Levin (2010) {{identify}} three {{properties of}} scales that can classify motion verbs into four types. The first property is {{existence of a}} scale, i.e. whether a verb denotes motion in a particular direction. This property classifies all motion verbs into two types: scalar change motion verbs (e.g., recede, return, enter) and nonscalar change motion verbs (e.g., fly, walk). Their second property is boundedness, that is, whether a scale has an endpoint or not, i.e. whether the motion event denoted by the motion morpheme has an inherent endpoint or not, which classifies scalar change motion verbs into two types: open scale (e.g., recede, ascend) and <b>closed</b> scale <b>motion</b> verbs (e.g., return, enter). The third proposed property is punctuality; that is, whether a scale is understood as having multiple points so that the motion along the scale is durative, or as having only two points (the starting and end points) so that the motion is punctual. The property of punctuality divides <b>closed</b> scale <b>motion</b> verbs into multi-point (e.g., return, come) and two-point <b>closed</b> scale <b>motion</b> verbs (e.g., enter, arrive).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Ω-loop of TEM β-lactamase is {{involved}} in substrate recognition and catalysis. Its dynamical properties and interaction with water molecules were investigated by performing multiple molecular dynamics simulations of up to 50 ns. Protein flexibility was assessed by calculating the root mean-square fluctuations and the generalized order parameter, S 2. The residues in secondary structure elements are highly ordered, whereas loop regions are more flexible, which is in agreement with previous experimental observations. Interestingly, the Ω-loop (residues 161 – 179) is rigid with order parameters similar to secondary structure elements, {{with the exception of}} the tip of the loop (residues 173 – 177) that has a considerably higher flexibility and performs an opening and <b>closing</b> <b>motion</b> on the 50 -ns timescale. The rigidity of the main part of the Ω-loop is mediated by stabilizing and highly conserved water bridges inside a cavity lined by the Ω-loop and residues 65 – 69 of the protein core.

Hydration of the cavity and exchange of the water molecules with the bulk solvent occurs via two pathways: the flexible tip that serves as a door to the cavity, and a temporary water channel involving the side chain of Arg 164...|$|E
40|$|Dramatic {{functional}} {{changes of}} enzyme usually require scores of alterations in amino acid sequence. However, {{in the case}} of guanylate kinase (GK), the functional novelty is induced by a single (S -> P) mutation, leading to the functional transition of the enzyme from a phosphoryl transfer kinase into a phosphorprotein interaction domain. Here, by using molecular dynamic (MD) and metadynamics simulations, we provide a comprehensive description of the conformational transitions of the enzyme after mutating serine to proline. Our results suggest that the serine plays a crucial role in maintaining the closed conformation of wild-type GK and the GMP recognition. On the contrary, the S -> P mutant exhibits a stable open conformation and loses the ability of ligand binding, which explains its functional transition from the GK enzyme to the GK domain. Furthermore, the free energy profiles (FEPs) obtained by metadymanics clearly demonstrate that the open-closed conformational transition in WT GK is positive correlated with the process of GMP binding, indicating the GMP-induced <b>closing</b> <b>motion</b> of GK enzyme, which is not observed in the mutant.
