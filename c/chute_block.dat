40|$|Geometry of {{the chute}} blocks in stilling basins plays a {{significant}} role in size and type of these structures. One of the most influencing factors {{in the design of the}} blocks is the fluctuating pressure which may cause fatigue on the blocks. Despite investigations conducted by many researchers, there is not enough information about the pressure fluctuation around chute blocks in compacted stilling basins such as Saint Anthony Falls (SAF) basins. In this paper, the results of a naval experimental work and measurement of pressure fluctuations around chute blocks of SAF stilling basins are reported. The results show that the pressure fluctuations around the chute blocks cannot be overlooked in designing such structures. The variation of pressure fluctuation with Froude number of incoming supercritical flow at various faces of the <b>chute</b> <b>block</b> is reported, which shows an increasing trend of pressure fluctuation. It is also observed that the submergence of hydraulic jump will decreasingly affect the pressure fluctuations. The trend of variations will follow different patterns at the different faces of the block...|$|E

5000|$|Still {{another use}} for manmade {{hydraulic}} jumps is energy dissipation. One {{example of an}} energy dissipating use is a hydraulic jump stilling basin. In these basins, horizontal and sloping aprons are used to dissipate up to 60% of the energy of incoming flow; the basins implement devices such as <b>chute</b> <b>blocks,</b> baffle piers, and dentated ends whose effectiveness in energy dissipation {{is dependent on the}} Froude number of the incoming flow. ‘Hydraulic jump stilling basins are not typically suggested for use when dealing with heads greater than 100 meters due to complications caused by turbulences like intermittent cavitation, vibration, uplift, and hydrodynamic loading.’ [...] Other hydraulic structures such as dams and weirs also use these same energy dissipating principles to reduce the incoming force from turbulent flows that tend to scour or erode downstream areas.|$|R

40|$|Cavitation in {{vertical}} flows is {{an important}} problem. In particular, cavitation in the vortices trailing from lifting surfaces such as propellers and hydrofoils has been studied extensively {{in the past few}} years. Factors which affect tip vortex cavitation include water quality (which relates to the amount of tension that can be supported before cavitation occurs), the details of vortex roll-up close to the tip, and flow unsteadiness. An experimental and numerical investigation has been conducted to examine these effects. The experimental phase reported herein includes lift and drag measurements, oil flow visualization of the boundary layer flow on lifting surfaces, and observation of cavitation inception in strong and weak water. An improved photographic technique has been developed to study the complex bubble dynamics inherent in the inception process. Preliminary results indicate that the growth process is strongly dependent on the size and number of nuclei in the free stream.

Intermediate between turbulent eddies and tip and hub vortices are a variety of secondary flow phenomena such as the horseshoe vortices that form around bridge piers, <b>chute</b> <b>blocks</b> and struts, and the secondary vortices that are found in the clearance passages of turbomachinery. The focus of this paper is on tip vortex cavitation. Recent research on tip vortex cavitation is discussed. This problem was first studied in detail by McCormick (1954, 1962). Subsequently, little further attention was given to this topic until recently, when there has been a resurgence of interest in the problem. Our understanding of the physics has been considerably enhanced in the past decade (1983 - 1993). The emphasis of this paper is on the details of the inception process.

40|$|Rock <b>chutes</b> or <b>block</b> ramps {{represent}} a valid and low environmental impact alternative as fishway passages. The {{interaction between the}} free surface and the bed material in flow over rock chutes under leads macro-roughness conditions to a high air entrainment into the flow. This improves the re-aeration in rivers with low dissolved oxygen content, due to the turbulence enhanced by the threedimensional macroroughness conditions. Thus the two-phase flow properties over macro- and intermediate roughness condition have got greater awareness in recent years. Air concentration properties and frictional properties were studied in uniform flow condition over different roughness conditions and general expressions were developed. Moreover, this study gives a general expression for estimating the air inception length. The turbulence nature and the energy dissipation characteristics of the flows over the macro- and intermediate roughness conditions were also studied...|$|R

Therefore, the correct {{assessment of the}} role of the sediment load on natural or anthropic pools morphology downstream of river grade control structures, such as rock <b>chute</b> or <b>block</b> ramps, is of fundamental interest for preserving the fish habitat and the river morphology. This work presents an experimental study on the sediment load influence on rectangular expanding pools downstream of block ramps in live-bed conditions. Several longitudinal and transversal expanding ratios have been tested. Ramp slopes were varied between 0. 083 and 0. 25. The effect of the pool geometry and the sediment load on hydraulic jump downstream of block ramp as well as scour morphologies and flow patterns have been analyzed.

This paper analyzes the air entrainment inception in flows over beds in macroroughness condition and the self-aerated flow features of the developing flow downstream of the inception point. Air concentration, inception point locations, and water depth elevations have been measured on two different scaled chutes for slopes ranging between 1 V: 5. 88 H and 1 V: 2. 17 H. Moreover, two different ogee crest lengths have been tested to assess {{the role of the}} inlet conditions on the location of the inception point. New equations have been developed to estimate the location of the point of inception and the respective water depth. Longitudinal variations of the mean air concentration downstream from the inception point have been studied and compared with data from the literature.

40|$|A {{high-resolution}} {{mosaic of}} Ida shows a highly irregular body (roughly 56 km long), heavily covered with craters, with many interesting geological features, including grooves, <b>blocks,</b> <b>chutes,</b> dark-floored craters, and crater chains. A satellite of Ida, with a preliminary designation of 1993 (243) 1, {{was discovered in}} orbit around Ida. It is approximately 1. 5 km in diameter, has an albedo and spectral reflectance not grossly different from Ida, and orbits Ida in a prograde direction with a period of roughly 20 hr. No other comparable-sized satellites have been found near Ida. New pictures of {{the opposite side of}} Ida reveal an irregular, dog-bone shape, with a prominent gouge that seems to separate Ida into two chief components. A V-shaped valley, well shown in the highest-resolution view of Ida returned in April, may mark a modest expression on the September face of the more dramatic feature on the back side. Ida's dense population of craters shows a wide diversity of morphologies, consistent with the surface having been subjected to saturated bombardment by smaller projectiles. Assuming the same projectile flux applies to Ida was used in deriving Gaspra's cratering age of about 200 m. y., and assuming that Gaspra and Ida both have the same impact strength, then the age of Ida's surface is calculated to be 1 - 2 b. y. This is considerably older than expected from other evidence concerning the Koronis family. Our favored explanation of Ida's satellite is that it (or a precursor satellite from which the present satellite was derived) formed during the catastrophic disruption event that formed Ida itself and formed the Koronis family of asteroids. Perhaps, instead, the satellite is a block ejected from a cratering impact. In any case, smaller blocks visible on some parts of Ida are more certain to be crater ejecta, {{whether or not they were}} ever temporary satellites...|$|R
40|$|New {{detailed}} {{data about the}} morphology of the submerged slopes of Lake Albano (Rome, Italy) have been collected by a sonar multibeam survey financed by the Italian Department of Civil Protection. These data allow for investigation of the subaqueous slope dynamics of the lake, which partially fills a volcanic depression, and the elucidation {{of the relationships between}} subaqueous and subaerial slope processes. Subaerial, submerged and combined subaerial/submerged landslide-related morphologies were detected around the inner slopes of the lake. In the submerged slopes, several gravity-induced landforms were recognized: landslide scar areas, landslide accumulations, erosional <b>chutes</b> and channels, <b>block</b> fields, isolated blocks, scarps and slope breaks. An attempt to evaluate the state of activity of the submerged slopes was carried out by taking into consideration the relative freshness of some selected landforms. Interpretation of bathymetric data, as well as direct surveys of the subaerial slopes, was used to assess the morphometric features and interpret the type of movement of the landslides. We propose a comprehensive classification based on the landslide’s size and type of movement. We recognized rock fall/topples, debris flows, rock slides and slump, complex rock slides/channelled flows and debris slide and slump. The volume of the main landslides ranged between 101 and 103 m 3, while a few rock and debris slides have volumes ranging between 103 and 105 m 3. Two large palaeo-landslides with volumes on the order of 106 m 3 were identified in the southern and northern part of the lake, respectively. Velocities of the recognized landslides range from rapid to extremely rapid. Two main landslide hazard scenarios have been depicted from the results of the integrated analysis of both subaerial and submerged gravity-induced landforms. The most hazardous scenario involves extremely rapid large volume events (> 106 m 3) that could, if they interacted with water, induce catastrophic tsunamis...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Bulk {{materials}} handling is {{a rapidly growing}} global industry. Immense challenges exist to improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of transporting and handling bulk materials continuously. The nature and scale of bulk {{materials handling}} varies from country to country. This study specifically focuses on the handling of bulk materials in the mining sector. Within this industry, transfer chutes are a key component used for transferring bulk material from one conveyor to another. Among other uses {{it can also be}} used under hoppers or silos to transfer material to conveyors, trains, trucks or ships. In a continuous effort to improve the efficiency of processes the industry is bombarded with transfer chute problems that include: •	<b>blocked</b> <b>chutes</b> •	high wear of liner materials •	spillage due to skew loading •	conveyor belt wear at loading points. Thorough investigation of existing transfer points, before modifying or replacing them with another configuration, gives better insight into the problems. This aids the designer {{to come up with the}} optimum solution for a specific transfer point. In this dissertation a study is done on the configuration of dynamic chutes or hood and spoon chutes. After completing a detailed investigation of existing problems, the study focuses on rectifying material transfer problems and designing for ease of maintenance. Adding to the improved flow in the new design, for the specific case study discussed in this dissertation, other design details are discussed which further validates the new design. This design improves the wear life of the liners inside the chute and minimises down time by reducing maintenance shutdowns. There are literally endless possibilities when it comes to chute configurations due to the uniqueness of each plant, material type and layout constraints. It is therefore beneficial to know what issues to address in the process of chute design or optimisation. This study focuses on a specific case study with unique problems and solutions. It should however give further insight and a basic understanding of what a chute designer must consider, and the methods taken, to optimise an existing material transfer point. The purpose of this document is therefore not to provide the reader with a recipe for chute optimisation but rather with the knowledge to comprehend the problems and solutions by discussing a specific industry case study.

40|$|It is {{surprising}} that gravel-bed rivers meander. In laboratory settings using cohesionless sediment transported as bedload, braiding inevitably emerges. The easily entrained outer bank sediments lead to relatively rapid bank erosion, the inner bank bar reaches it shallowest depth towards {{the center of}} the channel, the flow diverges, and braiding arises. These observations have led to the inference that meandering requires some bank strength to slow outer bank erosion and allow the inner bank to keep pace with outer bank retreat. Commonly {{it has been suggested that}} vegetation can provide that outer bank strength. While this view has led recently to numerical modeling incorporating vegetation strength, no studies had successfully created meandering rivers in the laboratory such that controlling mechanisms could be explored. Nor has there been an effort to delineate under what general conditions gravel bedded meanders are found in the field. These knowledge gaps are particularly important to stream restoration work because the creation of morphologically-stable gravel-bedded meanders is a common goal. 	This dissertation uses flume experiments and a compilation of field data to explore the conditions that support meandering in gravel-bed rivers. Using alfalfa sprouts as model vegetation, sand as scaled-down gravel, and a lightweight plastic as scaled-down sand, I created for the first time a self-maintaining, laterally migrating meandering river with cutoff loops in a 6. 1 -m wide, 17 -m long laboratory flume. The channel, 0. 4 m wide, had a sinuosity of 1. 1 - 1. 2 and transported sediment with a median size of 0. 78 mm. The sinuosity of the channel increased as bends grew, decreased as the channel cut off, and was regenerated while the channel maintained a steady width. In this experiment, we found that a steady bankfull flow was sufficient to sustain a meandering planform, and that application of higher peak flows caused the channel to widen because bank erosion outpaced bar growth. Coarse sediment was exchanged between eroding banks and the next bar downstream with little net downstream flux, consequently to prevent aggradation and avulsion at the upstream end of the experimental reach required turning off the coarse sediment feed. The input of fine sediment was crucial for <b>blocking</b> <b>chute</b> channels (a locus for braiding), filling point bars downstream of the bend apex, and plugging abandoned channels following cutoff. Hence, sustained growth of bends and development of meandering requires more than just sufficient bank strength to slow the outer bank erosion rate. 	A compilation of 166 gravel-bedded meanders from the literature shows that gravel meanders primarily occur in lower gradient reaches extending from mountain ranges, high-elevation valleys, and in humid areas influenced by glaciation or glacio-fluvial outwash. Unexpectedly, analysis of Google Earth imagery showed that about 1 / 3 of the dataset lacked cutoff scars and other evidence of active migration. Gravel bedded meanders with median surface grain size> 10 mm had low Shields stress, particularly for meanders with cutoffs and without islands. Gravel bedded meanders with median surface grain sizes < 10 mm had higher Shields stresses that were transitional between coarser gravel bedded meanders and finer sand bedded meanders. Calculation of potential sediment transport rates show that for 16 of the 18 gravel bedded meanders with migration rate data, the sediment flux from bank erosion exceeds this transport capacity, suggesting that bank erosion is a primary source of sediment. Collectively this shows that gravel bedded meanders can be classed into different types that reflect the relative migration rates and associated Shield stress and that generally gravel-bedded meanders are associated with low Shield stresses and relatively low sediment supply. 	Because of the importance of sediment supply in meandering rivers, I also investigated the morphological effects of doubling supply to a self-formed sinuous channel with 9 bends that was fixed in place. Five of these bends developed bar-pool topography. The doubling of supply caused the channel to steepen by 33 %, and the topographic response of bars was limited to shoaling of two pools as they filled with coarse sediment. One of the bars also extended upstream. Three other bends had limited changes to an increase in supply, likely due to the fixed walls that supported wide bars and narrow, deep pools. The maximum aggradation was greater than a channel depth, indicating that for a similar supply increase in a freely migrating channel would lead to avulsion. This experiment supports further the interpretation that gravel-bedded meanders are associated with relatively low sediment supply. 	The final experiment replicated our first alfalfa experiment but used a constant discharge and sediment supply with much denser alfalfa, in order to explore the effect of increased bank strength on channel morphodynamics. The denser alfalfa led to a narrower channel, but the migration rate was similar to our first experiment. As the channel migrated, associated decreases in the water surface slope caused the style of migration to change from focused on the entire bend to focus at the bend apex, creating skewed bends. As the bend skewness increased, the sediment flux at the flume outlet decreased, and most of the sediment flux out of the experimental reach was the lightweight plastic (model sand) rather than the coarse sediment supply. This created a channel with a sinuosity of 1. 6, but then the channel aggraded and cut off, decreasing the sinuosity (to 1. 2) and a corresponding increased slope. Following the cutoffs, the sediment transport rates and channel migration rates increased. The steady flow discharge and dense alfalfa limited cutoffs until aggradation altered floodplain hydrology to suppress alfalfa growth and create relatively weak paths through the floodplain. 	Taken together these studies show that for gravel bedded rivers to meander three conditions are needed: 1) additional bank strength (here from vegetation) to slow erosion rates' 2) low sediment supply and correspondingly low Shields stresses to prevent aggradation and avulsion as sinuosity increases; and 3) fine sediment to fill chutes and the downstream end of bars. Variable peak discharges are not necessary but may contribute to cutoffs that maintain a steeper slope able to transport the sediment supplied to the reach. These observations suggest that creating a self-maintaining laterally migrating gravel-bedded river as a restoration outcome will require an assessment of likely coarse and fine sediment supply as well as the ability of vegetation to provide sufficient bank strength...|$|R
