This study validates the relationship between certain critical factors and the <b>cost</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> green building projects. Support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), a data mining-based feature selection method, is applied to a data set comprising 53 green building projects.

40|$|AbstractMaintaining {{sustained}} attention {{over time}} is an effortful process limited by finite cognitive resources. Recent theories describe {{the role of}} motivation in the allocation of such resources as a decision process: the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> effortful <b>performance</b> are weighed against its gains. We examined this hypothesis by combining methods from attention research and decision neuroscience. Participants first performed a sustained attention task {{at different levels of}} reward. They then performed a reward-discounting task, measuring the subjective <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance.</b> Results demonstrated that higher rewards led to improved performance (Exp 1 – 3), and enhanced attentional effort (i. e. pupil diameter; Exp 2 & 3). Moreover, discounting curves constructed from the choice task indicated that subjects devalued rewards that came at the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> staying vigilant for a longer duration (Exp 1 & 2). Motivation can thus boost sustained attention through increased effort, while sustained performance is regarded as a cost against which rewards are discounted...|$|R

The sum <b>of</b> full <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> measures does not equal the full <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the <b>performance</b> program area, as NIH utilizes a representative sampling approach to report on program performance progress.

To allocate costs for program management, we selected the Research Management and Support (RMS) line item from the NIH mechanism display and Office of the Director Operations, a line item in the appropriation for the Office of the Director. Although these lines support some activities in addition to program management, they represent the majority of NIH program management activities. These totals were reduced by the direct <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the <b>performance</b> goals that are funded through RMS or OD operations.

In an engine running at lower RPMs, a smaller intake valve area forces a given volume of air to flow into the chamber faster; this causes the fuel to atomize better, and therefore burn far more efficiently.
