50|$|Hibiscus tiliaceus is {{a common}} coastal plant in Eastern and Northern Australia, Oceania, Maldives, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. It has become {{naturalized}} {{in parts of the}} New World, such as Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. It is uncertain if the species is native to Hawaii, as it may have been introduced by the Polynesians. Hibiscus tiliaceus can be found at elevations from sea level to 800 m in areas that receive 900 - 2500 mm of annual rainfall. It is commonly found growing on beaches, by rivers and in mangrove swamps. Sea Hibiscus is well adapted to grow in coastal environment in that it tolerates salt and waterlogging and can grow in quartz sand, coral sand, marl, limestone, and <b>crushed</b> <b>basalt.</b> It grows best in slightly acidic to alkaline soils (pH of 5-8.5).The plant lends its name to a coastal community in Cotton Tree, Queensland, Australia.|$|E

The apparatus eliminates the problem of adsorption of the released gases by fresh sample surfaces generated by crushing. Upper concentration levels for nitrogen, H 2, CH 4, O 2 and other gases released from <b>crushed</b> <b>basalts</b> are reported.

This mechanical crushing process more closely resembles the physical weathering/comminution processes of basaltic rocks on Mars, where meteoric impacts and wind abrasion are the mechanisms of comminution. The JMSS- 1 Martian soil simulant {{was produced}} via the following steps: (1) coarse crushing: using a jaw crusher, the mined Jining basalt and hematite with diameters of approximately 100 to 300 mm were crushed into small rocks with diameters of < 3 mm; (2) fine crushing: using a ball crusher, the coarse <b>crushed</b> Jining <b>basalt,</b> magnetite, and hematite were crushed to fine grains with diameters of < 1 mm; (3) mixing: these fine-grained samples were systematically mixed (93 wt% basalt, 5 wt% magnetite, and 2 wt% hematite); and (4) sieving and particle size adjustment: the grain size distribution was adjusted to achieve the target distribution by sieving the mixture.|$|R
50|$|Later in {{the nineteenth}} century and {{continuing}} to the present, mining became an important economic activity. Early businesses in Havelock included a post office, store, bakery, a blacksmith and a millinery and were located south of the current village on high ground at the intersection of County Road 30 and Old Norwood Road. In 1881, the Canadian Pacific Railway surveyed a right-of-way through the area north of Havelock and a year later laid rails and surveyed and filled the swampy land to make room for a larger village. The current village of Havelock was developed on the filled land by the tracks north of the former village site and was incorporated in 1892. In the fall of 1884, the first full passenger train stopped at Havelock, from Toronto on its way to Smith's Falls. Havelock was an important freight depot from the 1880s to the 1960s. The railway is now run by Canadian Pacific as Kawartha Lakes Railway and its activity today consists of transporting nepheline syenite and <b>crushed</b> <b>basalt</b> rock from two mines north of Havelock operated by Unimin. In 1998, the village of Havelock was amalgamated with the township of Belmont-Methuen to form the current township of Havelock-Belmont-Methuen.|$|E

For comparison, this technique was used in studying geometrical figures and terrestrial formations: sands, slags of present day volcanoes, and <b>crushed</b> <b>basalt.</b> It was established that regolith particles are shaped from the following groups: spherules; breccias and fragments; slags and sinters.

50|$|MMS or Mojave Martian Simulant was {{developed}} in 2007 to address some issues with JSC MARS-1. While the JSC MARS-1 does simulate some Martian regolith properties well, it does not do well with others, including its hygroscopic qualities—it has undergone weathering that attracts water, making it more clay-like. MMS, however, is hygroscopically inert due to minimal weathering {{and the way it}} is crushed, which allows it to better simulate that feature of Martian regolith, among others. MMS can be found naturally as whole rocks in a volcanic formation near the town of Boron, California, in the western Mojave desert. The darker color basalt rocks can be crushed or sorted without creating weathering marks on them. After <b>crushing,</b> <b>basalt</b> sands can be processed and graded into particular sizes, MMS Coarse and MMS Fine. MMS Dust is smaller basalt particles which matches to the particle size distribution of Martian dust. A separate volcanic event created red-colored cinder which is mined and crushed to create MMS Cinder.|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of the Earth's shallow crust is composed of basalt that erupted on the seafloor and was subsequently altered by chemical exchange with seawater. One aspect of this alteration is the replacement of glass by secondary minerals, including clays. Petrographic thin sections from ODP Holes 504 B and 896 A revealed characteristic patterns of pitting (channels) at the interface of fresh basalt glass and secondary clay. Fluorescent dyes that bind specifically to nucleic acids (Hoechst 33342, PO-PRO- 3, and Sytol 11) were used to examine thin sections for evidence of cellular life. Independent experiments with the three dyes indicated the presence of particulate nucleic acids at the interface of altered and unaltered glass, particularly at the distal tips of channels.

Plane-strain load-displacement tests were conducted with different footings and different lunar simulants in a deep transparent plexiglass container. The model footings considered include the rectangular, hemispherical, and spudcan designs.

Artificial rocks were made from cement, sands and basalt particles of different sizes in order to produce artificial rock differ in their textures. Three kinds of rock textures were designed to investigate the effects of the rock texture on the slope stability of benches at various angles of slope and various bench heights. <b>Crushed</b> <b>basalt</b> samples were collected from a basalt quarry in Sabaloga, these <b>crushed</b> <b>basalt</b> samples were classified to produce three sizes coarse, medium, and fine which were used to produce coarse, medium and fine artificial rock textures. It was found that the benches would be more stable at grains having sizes less than 5 mm for slope angle less than 75 degree. But when the grain sizes coarser than 5 mm, the benches would not be stable at this angle as a result of both tension and shear stresses depending on the bench height.

A new Martian soil simulant, called Jining Martian Soil Simulant (JMSS- 1), was developed at the Lunar and Planetary Science Research Center at the Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The raw materials of JMSS- 1 are Jining basalt and Fe oxides (magnetite and hematite).

The maximum bearing capacity of a densely packed sample with density of 2. 1 g/cm^ 3 was about 7 kg/cm^ 2. The effects of vacuum were insignificant compared with the effect of packing density. Direct shear tests indicated the cohesion in a few densely packed samples to be 1 - 2 X 10 ^ 4 dynes/cm^ 2.

40|$|Surface (0 – 10 cm) {{samples of}} 7 soils from {{tropical}} coastal Queensland were incubated {{at room temperature}} and at field capacity with finely ground (< 150 μ) basalt rock for 3 months. The amendment was applied at 0, 1, 5, 25 and 50 t/ha to cover situations of moderate application rates to that where the amendment might be banded to produce high local concentrations. Having an abrasion pH of about 9, the amendment was able to reduce both active acidity (as estimated {{by an increase in}} soil pH) and reserve acidity (reduction in % Al saturation of the CEC). Increases in soil pH resulted in increased CEC, depending on the variable charge nature of each soil, accompanied by increases in exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K supplied by the basalt. The amounts of basic cations converted to exchangeable form constituted {{only a fraction of the}} amounts applied. Thus the cations held in reserve ensure that the effect of cation enrichment will be prolonged. In some soils phosphate sorption was significantly reduced by <b>crushed</b> <b>basalt</b> application. Furthermore, ‘available’ P as measured by extraction with 0. 005 M H 2 SO 4 was increased. These effects appear to be due to the release of silicate from the basalt as well as modest amounts of phosphate in the rock. Three extractants commonly used for estimating Si availability in sugarcane production indicated that all 7 soils contained sub-optimal levels of the element. Application of <b>crushed</b> <b>basalt</b> rock increased extractable Si levels above what is considered sufficient for this crop. The incubated soils were placed in columns and leached with the equivalent of 2750 -mm (average wet season) rainfall.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{discussion of}} whether lunar basalt or regolith {{should be used}} as a resource for mineral processing schemes on the lunar surface, with pros and cons for each argument is presented. A literature review has shown that the majority of authors feel that mining the lunar <b>basalt,</b> <b>crushing</b> it, and then processing to remove the desired minerals, would be the route to take. The argument that this method would not be a sound mineral processing practice is presented. Mining and crushing are difficult propositions even on Earth; to attempt such processes in the hostile lunar environment would be a phenomenal task. It would be better to start with a simpler scheme, such as processing the regolith, which can be adapted to the multitude of unknowns facing the first lunar production plant. If, however, the lunar mining trend is followed, it must be kept in mind that mining and processing technology which is radically different from what is currently available and used on Earth will have to be developed. Podnieks and Roepke (1987) and Lindroth and Podnieks (1987) have summarized the new technology that may be applicable, but this technology is very similar to the current, 99 percent inefficient technology used on Earth. One such possible technique is sodium vapor fragmentation of basalt.

40|$|Knowledge of {{particle}} percolation impacts {{on both the}} economics and safety of cave mining operations. Nevertheless, very little {{research has focused on}} particle percolation in block or sub-level caving mines. The aim of this thesis is to study the percolation of fine particles in highly angular particle assemblies similar to caved rock, using physical and discrete element numerical models. In the first stage the magnitude and distribution of shear strain resulting from isolated draw was measured using scaled physical models (1 : 100) on 13. 20 mm <b>crushed</b> <b>basalt</b> aggregate. Digital images of marker particles were taken after each draw cycle and the changes in shear strain were calculated. In the second stage, a Shear Cell for Percolation of Geomaterials (SCPG) was designed for angular rock particles. Percolation tests were carried out for ideal media consisting of steel spheres (4. 00 mm), glass spheres (4. 00, 5. 00, 6. 00, 15. 75 mm) and plastic spheres (4. 00 mm) and highly angular <b>crushed</b> <b>basalt</b> aggregate (2. 86, 4. 05, 5. 21, 6. 18, 13. 20 mm). Key combinations of fine and bed-matrix particles were tested to quantify the effect of strain rate, particle diameter ratio, density and shape. Of the parameters tested, percolation was most influenced by particle diameter ratio, shape and strain rate, while density had the least effect. To explore the mechanisms controlling percolation across the range of tested particle shapes and sizes, a dimensionless percolation rate (DPR) relation was derived using the method of Bridgwater et al. (1978). In the third stage selected SCPG experiments were numerically simulated using PFC 3 D. Due to the limitations of PFC, particle shapes and sizes were simplified and all other parameters were kept as similar to the measured parameters as possible. Results from the physical SCPG experiments on angular particles were simulated using clump logic. The results were compared to corresponding numerical and physical experiments on mono-spherical particles with the same equivalent spherical diameter as the angular particles. The PFC results had broad agreement with the SCPG physical experiments showing that percolation is predominantly affected by particle shape and the ratio of fine and bed-matrix particle sizes...|$|E

This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} an experimental program aimed at investigating of the mechanical properties of composites based on aluminous cement for high-temperature applications and deal with the influence of high-thermal loading on polycarboxylate superplasticizing (PCSP) additive contained in the composite. The intent of this examination was caused by the suspicion that the action of high-temperatures can lead to burnout of the PCSP additive and thus subsequently affecting the mechanical properties of the final composite. Silica composites based on Portland cement and silica aggregates are not able to resist the effects of high-temperatures [1]. For high-temperature composites was therefore used aluminous cement Secar® 71 (Lafarge S. A.) in combination with <b>crushed</b> <b>basalt</b> aggregates of fraction 0 / 4 and 2 / 5 mm.

AA have upwards of 25 potentially identifying bands and this method defines sets of 10 – 19 bands per AA. Examination of AA-doped Mars-like basalt resulted in a maximum of eight bands being identified, as some characteristic bands were obscured by mineral bands, including the strongest intensity band in some cases. This proved the need for characteristic bands to be defined, enabling successful identification of AA. The ESA ExoMars Rover mission will crush and then pass the sample to the Raman Laser Spectrometer. We <b>crushed</b> a Mars-like <b>basalt</b> to a similar grain size expected to be created by the rover. Our samples were doped with 1 % (by weight) AA samples, resulting in no detection of AA, because of loss of original spatial context and spaces between the grains. We recommend that Raman spectroscopy on future missions should be conducted before the sample is crushed. Halite-entombed halophilic microbes, known to survive being entombed, were exposed to Mars-like surface (including temperature, pressure, atmospheric composition and UV) and freeze-thaw cycle (plus pressure and atmospheric composition) conditions. This test on the survival of the microbes showed that survival rates quickly deteriorated in surface conditions, but freeze-thaw cycle samples had well preserved Raman biosignatures, indicating that similar signatures could be detectable on Mars if similar life persists in evaporitic material or brines today...|$|R

Replicated columns were constructed with intact basalt core segments that contained natural fractures and with the same <b>basalt</b> <b>crushed</b> into particles. The columns were perfused with groundwater, and upon reaching a steady state, the columns were sacrificed and the attached and unattached communities were analyzed by multiple approaches. The analyses included the total number of cells, the phylogenetic affiliation of the cells (i. e., the α, β, and γ subclasses of the class Proteobacteria and gram positives with high G+C DNA content) by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), number and taxonomic affiliation by fatty acid methyl ester profiles of culturable heterotrophs, most-probable-number estimates of methanotrophs and phenol oxidizers, and whole-community sole carbon source utilization patterns from Biolog GN microplates. In the packed columns, about 99 % of the total biomass (per cubic centimeter of porous medium) was attached to the geologic medium. Lack of equitable units precluded a comparison of attached and unattached biomasses in the fractured columns where the attached biomass was expressed per unit of surface area. Compositional differences in the attached and unattached communities were evidenced by (i) the recovery of Pseudomonas stutzeri, an Enterococcus sp., and Bacillus psychrophilus from the groundwater and not from the basalt, (ii) differences between community carbon source utilization patterns, and (iii) the relative abundances of different phylogenetic groups estimated by FISH in both column types. In the packed columns, attached communities were depleted of members of the α- and β-Proteobacteria subclasses in comparison to those in the corresponding groundwater. In the fractured columns, attached communities were enriched in gram-positive Bacteria and γ-Proteobacteria and depleted of β-Proteobacteria, in comparison to those in the corresponding groundwater. Segregation of populations and their activities, possibly modified by attachment to geologic media, may influence contaminant fate and transport in the subsurface and impact other in situ applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to report a part of an ongoing research on the influence of using <b>crushed</b> <b>basalt</b> as aggregates on one of durability-related properties of concrete (i. e. alkali-silica reaction which is the most common form of Alkali-Aggregate Reaction). Alkali resistance has been assessed through several methods specified in the American Standards. Results of petrographic examination, chemical test (ASTM C 289) and accelerated mortar bar test (ASTM C 1260) have particularly been reported. In addition, the weight change and compressive strength of 28 days cured concrete containing basaltic aggregates were also reported after 90 days of exposure to 10 % NaOH solution. Dolomite aggregate were used in the latter test for comparison. The experimental results revealed that basaltic rocks quarried from As-Swaida’a region were suitable for production of aggregates for concrete. According to the test results, the studied basalt aggregates can be classified as innocuous with regard to alkali-silica reaction. Further, the 10 % sodium hydroxide attack did not affect the compressive strength of concrete...|$|E
