25|$|In September 1978, {{the ship}} was sold to a Canadian man for use by Food for the Hungry International. Despite being sold to a Canadian owner, British <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>agreements</b> allowed the ship to retain Australian registry. After a boiler refit, the ship {{relocated}} to Singapore and began operating in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand, rescuing Vietnamese refugees from boats and transporting them to shore. Several {{countries in the region}} refused the ship entry, and the Australian government persuaded the owner to change the ship's registry, as {{they did not want to}} be held responsible for any refugees rescued by an Australian-flagged vessel not under their control. The ship was re-registered as a Panamian-flagged private yacht under the name Akuna II on 4 February 1980. Around this time, a former United States Air Force pilot claimed to have purchased the ship from Food for the Hungry, and that he was using it to rescue US prisoners-of-war that were still interred in Vietnam. The pilot mass-mailed letters to families of missing-in-action soldiers asking for money to fund the rescue operations, but was later determined to be a money-making scam. Around the same time as the mass-mailing, the US government was informed that Akuna II was moored in Songkhla, having been there for about two years, with a two-man skeleton crew who lived aboard but knew nothing about how to operate or maintain the ship.|$|R

50|$|Most {{public housing}} in Australia was built between 1945, {{when the first}} <b>Commonwealth</b> State Housing <b>Agreement</b> was signed, and 1980, with governments in recent decades less willing to build and provide for new mass public housing estates.

However the construction of high-rise estates in Melbourne and Sydney during the 1950s and 1960s was aimed more at improving the living conditions of inner-suburban residents living in sub-standard housing.|$|R
50|$|In 1939 Lyons {{died and}} was {{replaced}} by Menzies; shortly after, World War II broke out and Menzies joined with Britain in declaring war on Germany. Under the changed circumstances, Playford renegotiated the deal in terms of shipbuilding rather than tinplate manufacture. In 1940 the <b>Commonwealth</b> Water <b>Agreement</b> Ratification Act was passed, complementary legislation passed through South Australia's parliament and South Australia's Engineering and Water Supply Department was given the task of getting the job done, under considerable pressure from the War Department, and with reduced manpower and materials due to exigencies of wartime. The first stage, from Whyalla to the Baroota Reservoir, was rushed through to help supply water for shipping. The whole route, using continuously welded steel pipe (supplied by Hume Pipe Company), four pumping stations and 127 concrete storage tanks, was completed in 1944, just in time to alleviate a serious drought that had hit the mid-North of South Australia. The pipeline was officially opened by the Governor of South Australia, Sir Charles Malcolm Barclay-Harvey in 1945.|$|R
