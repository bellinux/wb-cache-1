At the Paoay sand dunes, teams had to ride quad bikes and travel along a marked course measuring around 88 hectares. There were twenty check points with a basket, but only three check points contained their clue. Teams had to be careful in choosing because each basket could contain their clue, an hourglass (which teams had to turn over and wait for the sand to run out before continuing on), or a Rexona pass that guaranteed the team that the next three checkpoints would not contain their clue.|$|E

50|$|In Season One, {{a team of}} 3 contestants {{participate}} in the game. In Season Two, a team of 4 contestants {{participate in}} the game although {{one of them is}} locked up in the Inferno at the start. The contestants usually have a common bond (nurses, college students, models, chefs, etc,) The Soska sisters tell the contestants in the Hellevator part of the legend. The subsequent challenge relates to that part of the legend. In the second season, the overall legend relates to three of the Seven Deadly Sins, with each of the challenges relating to one of those three sins. The team members decide among themselves who will face that challenge, with each contestant having to take one of the three challenges. The contestant chosen exits the elevator and makes their way to the <b>challenge</b> <b>area</b> (they are usually told to follow the light that guides them). On the way there, they are usually either startled by sounds or actors intimidating them; or kidnapped by robed figures and taken to the <b>challenge</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

If they could not figure this out before the hourglass emptied, they would instead have to solve a surrealist jigsaw puzzle, which had an unusual configuration for completion (Not an exact rectangle). Teams were still required to walk back-to-back until they entered the <b>challenge</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
50|$|Day 33: That morning, Betong {{made himself}} busy to {{not to think}} about Maey. They later headed to the <b>challenge</b> <b>area</b> early that morning.

They were also among the final four who have never won an {{individual}} challenge before. Then, Betong started to shake and fell off, which led to Mara winning the last challenge of the season, after 2 hours and 11 minutes.

50|$|Day 15: After {{a stormy}} evening, the rain-drenched Nagar started {{rebuilding}} the roof's shelter and restarting a fire. At Sar Mayee, Ervic used {{his time with}} Elma to urge her to join his alliance. At Isla Misteryo, Moi finally found her luck in finding the buried coins. During her talk with Trizsa, the latter revealed his alliance with Jon and the voting options that they were planning. In the Immunity Challenge, spills, the rain, and temptations eliminated many castaways, leaving Elma, Aubrey, Mico, and Solenn still standing after three hours. Elma came down first when another temptation, a BLT sandwich, was presented. Thirty-six minutes later, an immunity bracelet was shown as yet another temptation, which Aubrey accepted. This gave Nagar tribal immunity in the process. Before leaving the <b>challenge</b> <b>area,</b> questionnaires were handed out to the tribes to be answered back at camp. With Aubrey already immune, Sar Mayee, particularly Jon's alliance, was left scrambling on who else to vote.|$|E

Buhawi opened the contents of his scroll, which said of him being designated as [...] "tribe leader". Aira would open hers at her first Tribal Council. Meanwhile, Princess, who never advanced through the cargo net after the challenge had finished, stayed behind at the <b>challenge</b> <b>area.</b> Later that night, to pass the time, Trizsa, Ian, Aubrey, and Myka did some role playing. Princess talked about her grievances and troubles with the show's resident psychologist. It was during this talk that she expressed her declaration to quit the game altogether due to hunger.|$|E

At {{the same time in}} the camp, the castaways and their loved ones (except Arnold's teammate) surfed using the surfboard brought by Mara's father. Instead of heading back to camp after the reward, KC, Troy, and their invitees immediately were brought in the <b>Challenge</b> <b>area.</b> In the Immunity Challenge, KC and Arnold had strong leads over the other castaways. However, they struggled in solving the Filipino word puzzle, resulting to Stef (being the fifth one to reach the top) winning the challenge by solving the word ALYANSA. After the challenge, the castaways said their goodbyes to their loved ones. Back at camp, Mara noticed the disappearance of the surfboard, which went along with his dad. Stef, Maey and Betong enjoyed Stef's new found accessory, the immunity necklace, with Arnold noting that this is an act of showiness. The castaways noticed how Arnold became so nice and hardworking at camp, knowing that the latter is no longer immune. The castaways then spent their night stargazing.|$|E

Echo, who was deemed by the medical staff to be well enough {{to return to the}} game, was sent back to camp, to the delight of her tribemates. At Airai, Charles told Louie about Cris talking to Shaun during the reward {{challenge}} the day before, thus, rousing suspicions about a conspiracy between the latter two. At the immunity challenge, Koror once again edged Airai 3-2 with Cris losing automatically to Amanda after he vomited. When Cris was once again given the immunity bracelet, Louie's suspicion about Cris grew, thinking that Cris blew the challenge so Koror would win. Before leaving the <b>challenge</b> <b>area,</b> the tribes were told of another new twist: each tribe would return to the opposing tribe's camp; anything that was left there would stay there. So when Koror returned to Airai's original camp, they were so furious to see its unkempt and slovenly condition, as opposed to their original camp, which Airai savored to their delight. Thus, Koror decided to clean and rearrange their new camp. At Airai, worried about her possible elimination, Mika asked Tara and Charles about voting out Louie, which the two assured that they would. Back at Koror, Suzuki once again amused his tribemates to take their minds off of the squalid conditions of their new home.|$|E
