50|$|In Hong Kong, {{the dish}} closest to Blood sausage is Pig blood <b>curd,</b> which is <b>only</b> made from pig's blood {{and is not}} {{considered}} a sausage.|$|R
50|$|In England, curds {{produced}} {{from the use}} of rennet are referred to as junket, with true <b>curds</b> and whey <b>only</b> occurring from the natural separation of milk due to its environment (temperature, acidity).|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} method for dolcelatte {{is similar to}} the methods used to make Gorgonzola. One difference is that it is made from the <b>curd</b> of <b>only</b> one milking, which makes it harder. It takes about two to three months to produce and age this cheese. The fat content of dolcelatte is higher than Gorgonzola at about 50%. Dolcelatte is comparable in taste and texture to dolceverde and torte gaudenzio cheese.|$|R
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} are industrially important microbes used {{all over the}} world in a large variety of industrial food fermentations. Cheese, cottage cheese, especially acid curd cheese, are characteristic dairy products for some Central and Eastern European countries. For production of acid <b>curd</b> cheese, <b>only</b> two components are needed: milk and lactic acid bacteria starter cultures. Starter cultures determine in large extent the technological process, the quality of the resulting quark and its shelf life. The composition of quark acid bacteria cultures is constituted in majority by Lactococcus and Leuconostoc bacteria. Selection of strains and construction of cultures with balanced species and stable composition for acid curd production is still very complex and presents a difficult challenge for producers of dairy cultures...|$|R
40|$|Semi-hard cheeses were {{manufactured}} at {{laboratory scale}} from milk inoculated at 2 % {{with a fresh}} culture of Micrococcus sp. INIA 528, or by mixing high enzymatic activity (HEA) curds, made with this strain, at 10 or 20 % with standard curds. Micrococci counts increased slightly during the first hours of manufacture and decreased gradually thereafter. Increases in proteolysis values of 63 % in cheese from milk inoculated with micrococci, and of 72 % in cheese made with 20 % HEA curds, with respect to control cheese were recorded after ripening for 14 days. Tributyrin esterase was detected from day 1 in cheese made from milk inoculated with micrococci and in cheeses with added HEA <b>curds.</b> However, <b>only</b> the addition of HEA curds enhanced lipolysis significantly, with a maximum increase of 85 % for cheese made with 20 % HEA curds after 14 days. Milk inoculation with micrococci and addition of HEA curds showed to be useful tools for the acceleration of cheese ripening. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Another {{distinctive}} feature of tissue stress {{is the principle}} of formation of its executive mechanism, the CURD, via tissuespecific self-damage of homologous tissue cells. Despite the fact that TAS, just as the cell stress, is realized via CURD, the TAS {{has a variety of}} features which distinguish it from the cell stress, the key one being the tissue-selectivity of CURD initiation under TAS effectors influence. In addition, under cell stress the cell protection is realized with <b>CURD</b> participation <b>only</b> via “passive” mechanism. It consists {{in the formation of the}} protective phase of this physiological reaction. Meanwhile, under tissue stress, its protective function may be carried out both the “passive” and “active” CURD-induced mechanisms. Thus, the cell stress mechanism is just one of the two instruments with which TAS protects the cells of homologous tissue. The third difference between tissue and cell stresses lies in ability of the former not only to increase but also to decrease the unspecific resistance of the cells. Meanwhile, the cell stress concept considers only the first possibility.|$|R
40|$|Ca 2 +-independent {{transglutaminase}} {{isolated from}} Streptoverticillium mobaraense {{was used to}} obtain a novel cheese we called “crosslinked cheese. ” We characterized both the cheese obtained by adding transglutaminase and milk clotting enzyme at the same time, and the one produced by adding transglutaminase, following cutting of the coagulum. In both cases, water content and cheese yields were higher, whereas protein content significantly increased from 33. 8 % to 39. 5 % only in {{the second type of}} crosslinked cheese. Isoelectric focusing of the protein extracted from the prepared cheese samples on a thin layer of polyacrylamide gel indicated that mainly β-caseins were involved in the transglutaminase-catalyzed crosslinks occurring in the curd. Few αs 1 -casein isoforms were entrapped in the <b>curd</b> matrix <b>only</b> when transglutaminase was added {{at the same time as}} the coagulant enzyme. Soluble nitrogen determination and HPLC peptide analysis indicated a markedly reduced proteolysis of crosslinked cheese during ripening, probably responsible for the observed enhancement of their hardness in comparison with the control cheese, obtained in the absence of transglutaminase...|$|R
40|$|Test {{procedures}} were developed {{for measuring the}} residual milk clotting activity of a protease produced by Endothia parasitica in curd and viii whey separated from freshly coagulated milk. A substrate was prepared by reconstituting 6 g low heat nonfat dry milk in 500 ml buffer containing 50 ml 0. 5 M cacodylic acid, 50 ml 0. 2 M CaCl 2, 30 ml 0. 2 M triethanolamine and 370 ml double distilled water. The substrate was stored at 2 to 4 C for 20 hours before use. Two milliliters of whey or supernatant from centrifuged curd-water slurries were inoculated into 25 ml of substrate at 30 C and the coagulation time noted, and compared with that produced by a known dilution of a standard enzyme solution. Endothia parasitica curd formed at pH 6. 7 contained 45 per cent of the enzyme activity added to 454 g milk hut when formed at pH 5. 2 the <b>curd</b> contained <b>only</b> 25 per cent. ix The recovery of Endothia parasitica protease in curd was made by preparing a 1 : 5 curd-water slurry, adjusting to pH 5. 4, filtering and testing the filterate...|$|R
40|$|Production of enriched curd by {{introducing}} a kelp of Laminaria family – Laminariaceae is discussed. The change of quality {{characteristics of the}} curd during storage have been studied. It was found that for the enriched product that meets the requirements of standards on the organoleptic, physico-chemical and microbiological parameters, optimal amount of kelp is 1 %. Bigger amount of Laminaria led to the slight increase in the acidity of the product and the deterioration of organoleptic characteristics. The microbiological analysis of samples of enriched cheese showed absence of coliform bacteria, bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus aureus and molds. During the entire storage period of product a decrease of product contamination was observed. The most intense microflora reduction observed in the test sample after 120 hours of storage. Hence, a kelp exhibit antimicrobial activity. During the storage period the number of micro-organisms met {{the requirements of the}} standards.  By the end of the storage period an amount of lactic acid bacteria in the product was at least 106 CFU / g. Adding of a 1 % kelp to the curd promoted slight increase the energy value of the product, while the iodine content increased by 10 times. Thus, the use for food of 100 g of the enriched by laminaria cheese satisfy the adult daily requirement of iodine by 60 – 70 %. Furthermore, the use of kelp as addition to the <b>curd</b> brings not <b>only</b> iodine but also vitamins, microelements and other beneficial agents for humans. Based on the above we can recommend this product as a prophylactic and preventive nutrition for different groups of the population suffering from iodine deficiency. </p...|$|R
