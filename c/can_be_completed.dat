5|$|Helvellyn may be {{included}} in a traverse of the full length of the Helvellyn range in either direction, but with a greater sense of climax when starting from the north. Most of the ridge track is a bridleway and so the route <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> by mountain bike in a challenging six-hour circular route of 16 miles off-road and 10 miles on-road riding. This may begin (and finish) at Mill Bridge near Grasmere.|$|E
5|$|If {{dropping}} {{the requirement for}} {{the uniqueness of the}} solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, but they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> to more than one solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is redundant. With slightly more than half the grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), the uniqueness of the solution constraint still dominates over the minimality constraint.|$|E

We discuss how to obtain the newest replica in an incomplete but completable quorum. In the traditional QB protocol, every quorum <b>is</b> <b>complete.</b> However, multimedia quorums <b>can</b> <b>be</b> completable.|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} items {{that can be}} picked up {{including}} smoke bombs and C4 explosives, {{as well as many}} different types of guns including a shotgun and a machine gun. The gun's ammo is limited and is replenished by collecting ten coins which are scattered around the map. In multiplayer mode, the player who collects the coins is the only person whose gun receives more ammo. Levels <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> in many different ways based on what characters the player or players choose. When playing in single-player mode, once a character is unlocked it can be used on any level and any level <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> as any character. In multiplayer mode, players work together to complete the levels. If one of the players dies, another must revive them before finishing the level.|$|E
5|$|To {{regain the}} Na'vi's trust, Jake connects {{his mind to}} that of Toruk, a dragon-like {{predator}} feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred Tree of Souls and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar {{with the aid of}} the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> {{in less time}} than other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E

5|$|In {{the board}} (and card) game domain, 4X {{is less of}} a {{distinct}} genre, {{in part because of the}} practical constraints of components and playing time. The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no extermination. Unless extermination is targeted at non-player entities, it tends to be either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed)</b> in board games.|$|E
5|$|Permanent seed {{implantation}} {{is suitable}} for patients with a localised tumour and good prognosis and {{has been shown to}} be a highly effective treatment to prevent the cancer from returning. The survival rate is similar to that found with EBRT or surgery (radical prostatectomy), but with fewer side effects such as impotence and incontinence. The procedure <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> quickly and patients are usually able to go home on the same day of treatment and return to normal activities after 1 to 2 days.|$|E
5|$|The Paladin Collector's Edition, {{a limited}} {{edition of the}} game, has a {{remote-controlled}} plane, the graphic novel Splinter Cell Echoes, a Billionaire's Yacht co-op map, an Upper Echelon pack with a Dead Coast map, gold sonar goggles, and a limited-edition poster. Splinter Cell: Blacklist - Spider Bot, a 2D puzzle game tie-in, was released for Android and iOS platforms on June 10, 2013 and is available on Google Play and the App Store respectively. Homeland, downloadable content for the game, was released on September 26, 2013. It added a crossbow, several new costumes, and two new missions which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> alone or with another player.|$|E

5|$|The V-scale, which {{originated}} in the United States, is an open-ended rating system with higher numbers indicating {{a higher degree of}} difficulty. The V1 rating indicates that a problem <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts. The scale begins at V0, and as of 2013, the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is V17. Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions {{in a variety of}} ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are changed in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Monaco {{consists of}} up to four players who each control different characters while they partake in s and robberies in many different locations. Players can control one of eight characters, each of whom have their own characteristics, such as the Hacker who can put viruses onto security systems, or the Cleaner who can put guards to sleep. The main difference between single-player and multiplayer modes is that in multiplayer, when a player dies they must be revived before the level <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed.</b>|$|E

50|$|Parasystole {{is a kind}} of {{arrhythmia}} {{caused by}} the presence and function of a secondary pacemaker in the heart, which works in parallel with the SA node. Parasystolic pacemakers are protected from depolarization by the SA node by some kind of entrance block. This block <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> or incomplete.|$|R
5|$|Unfortunately, the ship, now captained by Captain Tucker, is {{observed}} and attacked by Xindi vessels before the treatments <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed.</b> Outnumbered and heavily damaged, Phlox, T'Pol, and Archer race {{against the clock}} to create a subspace implosion. The ship is destroyed, but their plan works and the subspace parasites (which exist outside the normal space/time realm) are also destroyed by the implosion. The episode ends with the time-line reset; Archer is in sickbay recovering from a physical injury but will never develop the amnesia he originally suffered.|$|E
5|$|Deus Ex: Invisible War is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game developed by Ion Storm {{and published by}} Eidos Interactive for Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC) and the Xbox home console. The game released in 2003 in North America and 2004 in other regions. It is the second game in the Deus Ex series, and a direct sequel to the original game. The gameplay—combining first-person shooter, stealth and role-playing elements—features exploration and combat in environments connected to multiple city-based hubs, in addition to quests that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> {{in a variety of}} ways and flexible character customization. Conversations between characters feature a variety of responses, with options in conversations at crucial story points affecting how some events play out.|$|E
5|$|F-Zero GX is {{the first}} F-Zero game to feature a Story mode. Its story has the player {{assume the role of}} F-Zero pilot Captain Falcon in nine {{chapters}} of various racing scenarios; such as Falcon's training regiment, a race against a rival through a canyon with falling boulders, attack and eliminate a rival's gang, and escape from a collapsing building through closing blast doors. Each chapter <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> on a normal, hard, and very hard difficulty setting. Toshihiro Nagoshi, one of the game's co-producers, stated that this mode was included because the development team felt that the F-Zero universe was unique and they wanted to explain some of the characters' motivations and flesh out the game world.|$|E

Moreover, British identity was {{bound up with the}} empire.|$|R
5|$|Gameplay in Deus Ex {{emphasizes}} player choice. Objectives <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> {{in numerous}} ways, including stealth, sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. This level of freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, {{as a single}} play-through of the game will miss large sections of dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions, the player is encouraged to avoid using deadly force, and {{certain aspects of the}} story may change depending on how violent or non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its boss villains can be killed off early in the game, or left alive to be defeated later, and this too affects how other characters interact with the player.|$|E
5|$|The game {{world is}} divided into two halves: North and South Kyrat. Players start in South Kyrat and are free to explore it almost immediately, but can only unlock North Kyrat {{over the course of the}} story. The map is {{progressively}} opened by liberating bell towers, freeing them from Pagan Min's influence and allowing the Golden Path to expand. These towers help players reveal new areas and mark new locations of interest on the map. The world is scattered with outposts controlled by Pagan Min, which can be infiltrated by players. Four larger outposts, or fortresses, can also be found, and feature stronger defenses and more difficult combinations of enemies. If players successfully liberate these outposts, they will serve as fast-travel points, allowing quick navigation through the game's world. Additional missions and quests also become available. There are many side-missions that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed,</b> including hostage rescues, bomb disposal quests, and hunting missions. The collected animals' parts can then be used for crafting new pouches and belts.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} free to join {{any one of the}} servile groups and share common goals, or remain unaligned. Geneforge <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> without joining any group. Trajkov can be killed through combat or tricked into killing himself by using the Geneforge. He can also be aided in {{activating}} the device, if the player steals the shaper gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player fake shaper gauntlets, which do not protect Trajkov from the Geneforge's energy should he be convinced they are genuine shaping gloves. The player can complete the game by using the last boat on Sucia Island. The small vessel is moored in a guarded dock {{on the far side of}} the island. Finishing the game unlocks one of more than a dozen game endings, dependent on the player's actions during the game.|$|E

25|$|A {{deductive}} {{system for}} a logic {{is a set of}} inference rules and logical axioms that determine which sequences of formulas constitute valid proofs. Several deductive systems <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used for second-order logic, although none <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> for the standard semantics (see below). Each of these systems is sound, which means any sentence they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to prove is logically valid in the appropriate semantics.|$|R
