25|$|Brut Rose Champagnes {{came along}} in the 1990s, a version as dry as regular Brut Champagne. They are {{produced}} either by leaving the <b>clear</b> <b>juice</b> of black grapes to macerate on its skins {{for a brief time}} (known as the saignée method) or, more commonly, by adding a small amount of still Pinot Noir red wine to the sparkling wine cuvée. Champagne is typically light in colour even if it is produced with red grapes, because the juice is extracted from the grapes using a gentle process that minimizes the amount of time the juice spends in contact with the skins, which is what gives red wine its colour. Rosé Champagne {{is one of the few}} wines that allow the production of Rosé by the addition of a small amount of red wine during blending. This ensures a predictable and reproducible colour, allowing a constant Rosé colour from year-to-year. Popular in many countries and especially well-welcomed in Estonia where it was first introduced by an Estonian entrepreneur Henry-Jörgen Rautits, pink Champagne is very popular amongst high-end restaurants due to its soft yet sensitive taste, which is highly appreciated by wealthier customers.|$|E

40|$|Dr. Olga Padilla-Zakour, Dr. Edward McLaughlinTart cherries, Concord grapes, {{and apples}} {{are known for}} their health {{benefits}} due to high phenolic content and antioxidant capacity. Apples are also a rich source of fiber, helping {{to reduce the risk of}} some types of cancer. However, current juice processing leads to significant losses of these compounds through degradation heating and poor extraction from fruit. Pomace, a byproduct of pressing, is a rich source of total phenols, antioxidants, and dietary fiber. Therefore, alternative processing approaches which promote the preservation of these compounds are essential. Our objective was to develop pulpy juices from tart cherries, Concord grapes, and apples with maximum retention of fruit components and to evaluate storage quality of pulpy <b>juices</b> against <b>clear</b> <b>juices.</b> The following fruits were used in this study: Concord grape; tart cherry cv. Balaton and Montmorency; three varieties of red apple: Cortland, Empire, and McIntosh; and one variety of yellow apple: Golden Delicious. Fruits were harvested from the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station Orchards, Geneva, NY during the 2007 harvesting season. Juices were processed as clarified/clear (depectinased) and pulpy. A turbo extractor with two screen sizes, and a high shear mixer, were employed in pulpy tart cherry and Concord grape juice processing. A turbo extractor was used with or without a blanching and/or enzymatic treatment in pulpy apples juice processing. Juices were pasteurized by hot-filling at 85 ?C in 10 -oz glass bottles. Whole fruit and juices were analyzed for pH, acidity, soluble solids, and dry and pectin content. Juice viscosity was also measured. Shelf-life studies at 18 ?C were conducted at 0, 12, and 24 weeks to determine changes over time in color, percent settled solids, turbidity, total phenolics content, antioxidant capacity, anthocyanin content and polymeric color (only in tart cherry and Concord grape). Total phenolic and anthocyanin content, antioxidant capacity, and percent polymeric color in whole fruits were also measured in extracts prepared by methanol extraction of freeze-dried powdered fruit. Sensory evaluations were conducted at 0 and 24 weeks to determine an acceptance of color, flavor, mouthfeel, and overall acceptability using a 7 -point hedonic scale. The ranking test was used for flavor intensity and preference. Pulpy juices had higher phenolic and anthocyanin content, and antioxidant capacity than <b>clear</b> <b>juices</b> of the same fruit type; the content was comparable to that of whole fruits. These compounds in pulpy juices were 73 to 87 % of whole tart cherry, 95 to 100 % of whole Concord grapes, and 60 to 100 % of whole apples. The percent loss over time of these compounds was similar in <b>clear</b> and pulpy <b>juices</b> from tart cherry and Concord grapes; however, the content in pulpy tart cherry juices was 13 to 41 % higher than that of <b>clear</b> <b>juices,</b> and 50 to 134 % higher in Concord grape juices. Even though the percent loss of total phenols and antioxidant capacity over 24 weeks in <b>clear</b> apple <b>juices</b> was lower (0 to 11 %) than that of pulpy juices (6 to 22 %), pulpy juices had 1. 7 to 3. 6 times higher total amounts of these compounds than <b>clear</b> <b>juices.</b> Dry content of pulpy juices were 0. 3 to 11. 8 % higher than <b>clear</b> <b>juices.</b> Pectin content of pulpy juices was comparable to that of whole fruits. There was almost no pectin in <b>clear</b> <b>juices.</b> Pulpy juices represented a rich source of soluble fiber and one serving contained 0. 7 to 11. 6 g pectin. Sensory evaluation confirmed that overall acceptability and preference of pulpy juices were as equally acceptable as <b>clear</b> <b>juices</b> at 0 weeks storage but was lower at 24 weeks. However, pulpy juices were rated positively in all attributes and thus were acceptable from a consumer view point. Pulpy juices could be a healthy shelf-stable fruit juice product if the processing is optimized. Fulbright Foundation, Department of Food Science and Technology (Cornell University...|$|R

40|$|Dietary {{factors have}} been shown to {{contribute}} to the occurrence or persistence of chronic non-specific diarrhoea (CNSD). Among these are low dietary fat, high fluid consumption, and the consumption of apple juice. Prompted by the clinical impression that freshly pressed and unprocessed ('cloudy') apple juice was less likely to induce diarrhoea than normal, enzymatically processed ('clear') apple juice, both juices were compared in terms of carbohydrate malabsorption, gastric emptying, and effects on defecation patterns. Clear and cloudy apple juice differ in their fibre and non-absorbable monosaccharide and oligosaccharide contents. Ten healthy children aged 3. 6 to 5. 9 years ingested 10 ml/kg of clear and cloudy apple juice; in five of them it was enriched with 40 mg of [1 - 13 C]-glycine. <b>Clear</b> apple <b>juice</b> resulted in increased (> or = 20 ppm) breath hydrogen excretion in 8 / 10, compared with 5 / 10 after cloudy apple juice; peak breath hydrogen was higher in the <b>clear</b> apple <b>juice</b> group (35 (4) and 18 (3) ppm, respectively). Gastric emptying as determined by means of labelled breath carbon dioxide (13 CO 2) excretion was similar with both juices. In a four week crossover clinical trial 12 children, formerly diagnosed as having CNSD, were given extra clear fluids (excluding fruit juices; > or = 50 % over basal consumption), <b>clear</b> apple <b>juice,</b> or cloudy apple juice, for five day periods. Extra fluids and cloudy apple juice did not influence stool frequency and consistency compared with the basal period. In contrast, <b>clear</b> apple <b>juice</b> significantly promoted diarrhoea.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of pulsed high {{hydrostatic}} pressure was investigated {{as a possible}} approach to stabilize foodstuffs. The objective {{of this article was}} to investigate the effect of the main processing variables (pressure [150 to 300 MPa], temperature levels [25 to 50 ◦C], and pulse number [1 to 10]) on the sanitation of nonpasteurized <b>clear</b> Annurca apple <b>juice</b> as well as freshly-squeezed <b>clear</b> orange <b>juice.</b> The aim of the article was the optimization of the process parameters in step-wise pressure treatment (pressure holding time of each pulse: 60 s, compression rate: 10. 5 MPa/s, decompression time: 2 to 5 s). The shelf life of the samples, processed at optimized conditions, was evaluated in terms of microbiological stability and quality retention. According to our experimental results, the efficiency of pulsed high pressure processes depends on the combination of pulse holding time and number of pulses. The pulsed high pressure cycles have no additive or synergetic effect on microbial count. The efficacy of the single pulses decreases with the increase of the pulse number and pressure level. Therefore the first pulse cycle ismore effective than the following ones. By couplingmoderate heating to high pressure, the lethality of the process increases but thermal degradation of the products can be detected. The optimization of the process condition thus results in a compromise between the reduction of the pressure value, due to the synergetic temperature action, and the achievement of quality of the final production. The juices processed under optimal processing conditions show a minimum shelf life of 21 d at a storage temperature of 4 ◦C...|$|R
