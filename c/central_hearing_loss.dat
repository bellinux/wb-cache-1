40|$|To {{gain more}} insight into <b>central</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> we {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} cortical thickness and surface area, speech-relevant resting state EEG power, and above-threshold auditory measures in older adults and younger controls. Twenty-three older adults and 13 younger controls were tested with an adaptive auditory test battery to measure not only traditional pure-tone thresholds, but also above individual thresholds of temporal and spectral processing. The participants’ speech recognition in noise (SiN) was evaluated, and a T 1 -weighted MRI image obtained for each participant. We then determined the cortical thickness (CT) and mean cortical surface area (CSA) of auditory and higher speech-relevant regions of interest (ROIs) with FreeSurfer. Further, we obtained resting state EEG from all participants as well as data on the intrinsic theta and gamma power lateralization, the latter in accordance with predictions of the Asymmetric Sampling in Time hypothesis regarding speech processing (Poeppel, Speech Commun 41 : 245 – 255, 2003). Methodological steps involved the calculation of age-related differences in behavior, anatomy and EEG power lateralization, followed by multiple regressions with anatomical ROIs as predictors for auditory performance. We then determined anatomical regressors for theta and gamma lateralization, and further constructed all regressions to investigate age as a moderator variable. Behavioral results indicated that older adults performed worse in temporal and spectral auditory tasks, and in SiN, despite having normal peripheral hearing as signaled by the audiogram. These behavioral age-related distinctions were accompanied by lower CT in all ROIs, while CSA was not different between the two age groups. Age modulated the regressions specifically in right auditory areas, where a thicker cortex was associated with better auditory performance in older adults. Moreover, a thicker right supratemporal sulcus predicted more rightward theta lateralization, indicating the functional relevance of the right auditory areas in older adults. The question how age-related cortical thinning and intrinsic EEG architecture relates to <b>central</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> has {{so far not been}} addressed. Here, we provide the first neuroanatomical and neurofunctional evidence that cortical thinning and lateralization of speech-relevant frequency band power relates to the extent of age-related <b>central</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in older adults. The results are discussed within the current frameworks of speech processing and aging...|$|E

40|$|Age-related {{hearing loss}} (presbycusis) {{is a highly}} {{prevalent}} disease and can have a severe negative impact on social interactions, and eventually {{on the quality of}} life of the people affected. It is therefore of the utmost importance to find biomarkers from which to evaluate presbycusis. Studying presbycusis comprehensively constitutes a complex undertaking because hearing problems are frequently reported by older adults whose hearing impairment has failed to be identified through the traditional assessment of hearing loss, in which such impairment is viewed as a phenomenon occurring at the auditory periphery only. This PhD thesis is among the first to report behavioral consequences and biomarkers of hearing and speech processing problems in older adults which occur independently of peripheral hearing loss. This PhD thesis provides new insights into auditory perceptual difficulties in older adults and their most common treatment. It extends present frameworks of age- related hearing loss by suitably combining EEG, structural MRI and behavior. The results of the experimental work done in this PhD thesis have several implications: first, novel hearing tests assessing multifactorial aspects of hearing loss, especially <b>central</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> should be implemented in clinics; second, <b>central</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> emerges as a function of age-related changes in the morphology and functional lateralization of the auditory areas of the brain; third, peripheral hearing impairment delays central auditory plasticity, which suggests that preventive treatment is the key to understanding speech into old age; and fourth, hearing aids are indispensable for rehabilitation, but clinics need to inform older adults that the hearing aid type and algorithm can only be evaluated after intensive hearing aid usage, across 12 weeks for approximately 12 hours a day. Finally, the fact that hearing aids mainly focus on peripheral hearing treatment points to the necessity for new rehabilitation ideas. It is hoped that the accumulated findings of this PhD thesis will open the door for such novel innovation...|$|E

Methods: 20 individuals with autism and Asperger syndrome and 20 individuals without psychiatric disorders from eight to 19 years of age, were submitted to audiological and electrophysiological evaluation. Results: No alterations were observed on the audiological evaluation in all the individuals. In ABR, 50 % of individuals with autism and 30 % with Asperger syndrome presented alterations. Significant statistical differences were observed between the groups in the quantitative analysis. All groups presented alterations in AMLR and P 300. In AMLR, no significant statistical differences were observed between the groups in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. In the P 300, we noticed significant statistical differences between Asperger and control groups in the quantitative analysis. Conclusions: A high occurrence of alterations in auditory evoked potentials was seen in children with psychiatric disorders, although in some analysis it was observed a non-statistically significant difference when comparing study and control groups.

40|$|Background: The {{survival}} of preterm infants has increased substantially over {{last few decades}} because of improvements in obstetric and neonatal care. However, the newborn experience many perinatal complications including peripheral or <b>central</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> The prevalence of hearing loss {{is reported to be}} 1. 5 – 6 per 1000 newborn in the well-baby nursery population. Brainstem evoked response audiometry (BERA) is a simple, noninvasive way of evaluating the hearing function and has been widely used for early detection of hypoacusis and neural conduction irregularities in the auditory pathway. Several risk factors associated with hearing loss during early infancy, such as hereditary cause, in utero infection, prematurity, asphyxia, hyperbilirubinemia, and ototoxic medications, have been described by the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing. Aims & Objective: To analyze and compare BERA responses in preterm and term infants. Materials and Methods: The infants (30 preterm and 30 term) attending Pediatric OPD of Bapuji Hospital and Chigateri General Hospital satisfying the inclusion criteria were subjected to BERA. Parameters such as absolute latencies of waves I, III, and V, and interpeak latencies (IPLs) I–III, I–V, and III–V were assessed and analyzed by using unpaired t-test.

40|$|Purpose: In {{pediatric}} {{population with}} SNHL, a radiological presurgical mapping exam is usually performed, {{purpose of this}} study is to improve the inter-rater agreement giving different imaging modalities using MDCT and MRI to facilitate identifying patients in need for surgical modification before cochlear implant. Methods and material: 120 pediatric patients ranging between 1 and 12  years with an average age of 5  years diagnosed with congenital or acquired SNHL and requiring cochlear implant (CI) after proper surgical selection were included in the study. All patients underwent combined 64 detector MDCT using pediatric low dose protocol with sagittal, Stenvers views in addition to standard axial and coronal plane reconstruction from single acquisition volume. In the same session, 3 D DRIVE MRI axial plane reformatted into sagittal plane for the IAC and inner ear as well as axial T 2 WI/FLAIR for the whole brain. Two different head and neck radiologists blindedly reported the inner ear, cochlear nerve development, temporal bone anatomy, operative window, as well as normal variants that could hinder implantation as well as causes of <b>central</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Findings were compared with operative findings. Results: Patients were categorized into four groups; according to the capability of electrode implant, modification of surgical techniques and expected response with high intra-observer was noted with a PABAK value of 0. 96 for observer A and of 0. 93 for observer B. Lower inter observer agreement was observed on an individual usage of radiological techniques for reaching diagnosis (conventional CT, MRI, or Stenvers/sagittal oblique techniques alone) with a PABAK value of 0. 93, 0. 78 and 0. 73, respectively. A higher inter observer agreement was met on combining all these radiological modalities together (PABAK value of 0. 96). Conclusion: Stenvers view efficiently makes pre-surgical mapping for the intra-cochlear electrode pathway by identifying the cochlear turns, round and oval window, vestibule and SCC as well as facial nerve canal in one view helping the surgeon in optimizing the technique. MRI identifies the fibrous labyrinthitis ossificans not detected by CT and evaluates the cochlear nerve development and integrity of central auditory pathway. Combined MDCT/MRI imaging protocol helps the clinician in proper patient categorization, optimize their surgical approach and the type of electrode. Clinical relevance/application: SNHL is a malfunction of the inner ear, vestibulocochlear nerve or central auditory pathway. Imaging helps to establish treatment regimens that improve auditory function...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of auditory processing tests {{to patients with}} sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is controversial. Several {{studies have shown that}} it is difficult to separate peripheral from <b>central</b> <b>hearing</b> processes. In the present study, a Dutch auditory processing test battery was administered to 24 subjects with mild, relatively flat, symmetrical sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Tests were administered twice; the second time, the presentation level in four out of the six tests was adjusted according to the speech reception threshold.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study investigates {{the challenges and}} the problems in marriage when one partner has a hearing impairment and the other hears normally. Such knowledge is intended to help clinicians and researchers {{to have a more}} accurate picture of the lives of hearing impaired people in that it incorporates both positive and negative dimensions; and helps to lessen the likelihood that they will project their own negative fantasies on to their patients, clients and respondents. A method of investigation devised by Elizabeth Bott (1957) using repeated intensive interviewing, was adopted with certain adaptations. Using her approach, with other theoretical material, has produced an ethnographic study which illuminates the interaction between peoples' psychosocial experiences and the medical and audiological nature of hearing impairment. Eleven couples were interviewed ten times and five single people were interviewed five times. In the analysis of the findings, five major strands emerged: intimate family relationships, social support networks, communication strategies, the nature of care and rehabilitation, and recommendations for social policy. From this work particular psychosocial insights emerged. The research suggests that although acquired <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is a widespread problem in our society due to the growth in the numbers of elderly people in the population compounded by Noise Induced <b>Hearing</b> <b>Loss,</b> present provision is far from adequate.

40|$|Aims: To {{describe}} the auditory and language outcomes {{of children with}} early diagnosis and treatment for congenital toxoplasmosis. Methods: A cross-sectional study included all children diagnosed with congenital toxoplasmosis, through the Minas Gerais State Neonatal Screening Program, from September 2006 to March 2007. All children received early treatment, initiated {{before the age of}} 2. 5 months, and were periodically assisted by a team of specialists including pediatricians, ophthalmologists and speech-language therapists and audiologists. Hearing function was evaluated with the following procedures: tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, behavioral observation audiometry, and brainstem auditory evoked potentials. Hearing function and sensitivity was estimated and audiological results were classified as normal, conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> sensory-neural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and <b>central</b> dysfunction. Language performance was assessed and classified as normal or abnormal, according to test results. The following variables were studied: audiological results, neurological and ophthalmological conditions, language performance and presence of risk indicator for <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> other than congenital toxoplasmosis. Univariate analysis was conducted using the chi-square or Fisher’s Exact test. Results: From September 2006 to March 2007, 106 children were diagnosed with congenital toxoplasmosis through the neonatal screening program, and were included in the study. Data analysis showed normal hearing in 60 children (56. 6 %), while 13 children (12. 3 %) had conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> four children (3. 8 %) had sensory-neural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and 29 children (27. 4 %) presented <b>central</b> <b>hearing</b> dysfunction.

30|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine three questions: (a) how <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> affects the choice of transportation mode; (b) view on <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in relation to transport; and (c) need and design of support systems for road users with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> In general, the results reveal that <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> affects some aspects regarding how individuals experience safety as well as mobility in transport situations, where as other situations remain unaffected by the degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} study was {{identify}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in thalassemic patients with history of Desferrioxamine (DFO) therapy. This study {{was carried out}} in a cross-sectional descriptive survey on 195 thalassemic patients (3 - 30 years old) in Gazvin Thalassemia center and Tehran pediatrics' medical center. Methods: The patients underwent routine otolaryngologic history and physical examination, along with standard pure-tone audiometry. Results: <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was present in 43. 1 % of patients. 16 % of patients had conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and 4. 6 % of patient had sensory neural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> 22. 5 % of thalassemic patients had high-frequency sensory neural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and more importantly, high-frequency <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> attributable to Desferrioxamine ototoxicity was present in 12 % of patients. Furthermore, these evaluations showed that there is a significant relationship between <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and DFO usage and <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> too. There is no significant relationship between <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and ferritin level between <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and age of DFO usage too. Conclusion: Management of these patients requires proper dosing of Desferrioxamine, along with regular otolaryngolgic and audiometric follow-up in order to prevent the effect of ototoxicity of desferal...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{negatively}} impacts a person's {{quality of}} life. Only 20 % of 46 million Americans with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> seek amplification treatment. It {{is imperative to}} address the disparity within the general public between those who have <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and those who seek treatment for <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> The goal of this research project is to determine whether education, through in-person presentations, {{can be used to}} improve their knowledge on <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Sixty African Americans between 50 and 90 years of age participated in the study. Participants were given a pre-presentation questionnaire, followed by a presentation was that discussed: the types and causes of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> treatment for <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> and the effects of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Participants then filled in a post-presentation questionnaire and hearing tests were conducted to test their outer, middle, and inner ear functions. Results indicated that in-person presentations increased participants’ knowledge about <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and <b>hearing</b> health care. Participants responded to the presentations extremely positively, and indicated that further discussion about hearing health care is both wanted and needed. However, additional research {{needs to be done to}} determine whether the presentations have encouraged participants to seek treatment for <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> B. A. (Bachelor of Arts...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{wide range}} of {{prevalence}} figures when it comes to Down syndrome and <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> varying between 2 % and 81 % in earlier studies. There are different theories as to the cause of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> such as middle ear pathology and age. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate different aspects of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in association with Down syndrome in the Swedish population. The data analysed consisted of 83 females and 119 males with confirmed Down syndrome between the ages of 8 to 67 years. Different aspects with focus on the prevalence, type, degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and difference based on age and gender amongst the participants were studied. Our results show that <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was present in 64, 6 % of the ears, whereby the majority had a mild <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Binaural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was observed in 57, 5 % of the participants. Whether the results are an indication of early age-related <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> cannot be confirmed because there was not enough information to analyze the type of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> However, it was observed that persons with Down syndrome exhibit high frequency <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> from an early age.
