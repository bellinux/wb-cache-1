40|$|To {{identify}} issuer motives, {{we study}} {{the determinants of}} announcement effects of convertible debt issues in the Canadian market.

Equity-like convertibles are significantly negatively affected by agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> However, agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> debt have no significant effect on debt-like convertibles. Consistent with Stein (1992), this suggests convertibles in particular represent a substitute for equity. Moreover, convertible debt offers announced by income trusts experience significantly less negative wealth effects than offers by nontrusts - a finding explained by a more debt-like convertible design, very low agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> in case <b>of</b> income trusts, or both...|$|R
40|$|In a 2004 study, Harvey, Lin and Roper {{argue that}} debt makers with a {{commitment}} to monitoring can create value for outside shareholders whenever information asymmetry and agency costs are pronounced. I investigate Harvey, Lin and Roper's claim for bank loans by empirically testing the effect of information asymmetry and direct agency costs on the abnormal returns of the borrowers' stock around the announcement of bank loans. I divide my study into two main sections. The first section tests whether three proxies of the direct agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> are equally significant in measuring the direct costs associated with outside equity agency problems. I find that the asset utilization ratio proxy is the most statistically significant proxy of the direct agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> using a Chow F-test statistic. The second main section of my dissertation includes and event study and a cross-sectional analysis. The event study results document significant and positive average abnormal returns of 1. 01 % for the borrowers' stock on the announcement day of bank loans. In the cross sectional analysis of the borrowers' average abnormal stock returns, I find that higher quality and more reputable banks/lenders provide a reliable certification to the capital market about {{the low level of}} the borrowers' direct agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> and information asymmetry. This certification hypothesis holds only for renewed bank loans. In other words, in renewing the borrowers' line of credit, the bank/lender is actually confirming that the borrower has a low level of information asymmetry and direct <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> Given such a certificate from the banks/lenders, shareholders reward the company/borrower by bidding the share price up in the capital market...|$|R

40|$|The {{pecking order}} predicts that equity costs exceed debt costs when {{managers}} require outside funding. Primarily, these differential issuance costs arise because investors, who have inferior information, must discount new securities that managers issue. I use a statistical model to estimate issuance <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> The model uses {{years in which}} managers choose not to issue a type of security in order to estimate the issuance <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> that security. These estimates exhibit patterns that challenge the pecking order. First, after controlling for issuance costs, profits and cash holdings {{reduce the amount of}} debt firms issue, but not the amount <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> Second, debt <b>costs</b> increase from about 50 % <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>costs</b> in 1973 to 140 % <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>costs</b> in 2002. For all years after 1997, debt issuance costs actually exceed equity issuance costs. This pattern appears in a broad set of firms, as well as in subsets of firms chosen by market capitalization or analyst following. Third, information asymmetry does not increase the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> issuing <b>equity</b> relative to the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> issuing debt. This is true whether asymmetric information is measured by market capitalization or analyst following. On the other hand, information asymmetry appears to increase debt and equity costs individually. Fourth, information asymmetry reduces the issuance <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> relative to debt across industries. Overall, this implies that the pecking order cannot consistently explain firm capital structure decisions. Moreover, the premise upon which the pecking order is founded, information asymmetry costs between insiders and outsiders, does not push firms toward a pecking order. Considering distress costs or debt capacity cannot reconcile the pecking order to these facts...|$|R
