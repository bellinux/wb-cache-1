5|$|The farm {{utilized}} {{the concept of}} a European <b>country</b> <b>seat,</b> through tenant farming, established blacksmith, wheelwright, and harness shops on-site, in addition to a butcher shop and smokehouse. Buildings were centrally located around Walter Law's manor house, many of which were constructed in the Tudor Revival style. The farm's office building, Dysart House, the Briarcliff Lodge, and the railroad station shared that architectural style.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} modern period the house has been the <b>country</b> <b>seat</b> of several {{prominent}} families including the St Loes one of whom married Bess of Hardwick. They lived at Sutton Court and expanded the property {{in the second half}} of the 16th century. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries it was owned by the Strachey baronets and their descendants until it was sold in 1987 and converted into apartments. In the Early 1980's the house was used as a film location for the BBC Look and Read series 'Dark Towers', a series very popular to this day in Primary schools.|$|E
5|$|The farm {{combined}} {{a practical}} American business model {{with the concept}} of a European <b>country</b> <b>seat</b> or manor, with cows being milked constantly, and with milk promptly chilled and bottled within five minutes, and shipped to stores in New York City each night. The farm was progressive, with sterile conditions, numerous employee benefits, good living conditions for livestock, and regular veterinary inspections to maintain a healthy herd. The farm also made use of tenant farming, established working blacksmith, wheelwright, and harness shops on-site, was located around Walter Law's manor house, and constructed numerous buildings in the Tudor Revival architectural style.|$|E

5|$|Waugh left Piers Court on 1 September 1939, at the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War and moved his young family to Pixton Park in Somerset, the Herbert family's <b>country</b> <b>seat,</b> while he sought military employment. He also began writing a novel in a new style, using first-person narration but abandoned work on it when he was commissioned into the Royal Marines in December and entered training at Chatham naval base. He never completed the novel: fragments were eventually published as Work Suspended and Other Stories (1943).|$|E
5|$|Agnes and Gebhard {{married on}} 2February 1583 in Bonn and retired to the Elector's <b>country</b> <b>seat</b> in Poppelsdorf to {{celebrate}} their nuptials. Within weeks, the Cathedral chapter had deposed Gebhard, electing in his place an old opponent, Ernst of Bavaria, the brother of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria, who immediately set about raising an army {{with the help of}} his brother the duke, and his second brother, Ferdinand of Bavaria. In the spring and summer, Agnes and Gebhard did likewise, traveling to different parts of the electorate, raising an army, and extending the Protestant cause. By October, Ernst's brother Ferdinand entered the electorate from the south, near Koblenz. In their northward progress, they left a path of fire and destruction. Agnes and Gebhard fled, as Poppelsdorf, then Godesberg, and later the capital city of the electorate, Bonn, were over-run and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 1750, now well-known, the {{architect}} received an important commission to remodel Euston Hall in East Anglia, the Suffolk <b>country</b> <b>seat</b> of the influential 2nd Duke of Grafton. The original house, built circa 1666 in the French style, was {{built around a}} central court with large pavilions at each corner. While keeping the original layout, Brettingham formalised the fenestration and imposed a more classically severe order whereby the pavilions were transformed to towers in the Palladian fashion (similar to those of Inigo Jones's at Wilton House). The pavilions' domes were replaced by low pyramid roofs similar to those at Holkham. Brettingham also created the large service courtyard at Euston that now acts as the entrance court to the mansion, which today is {{only a fraction of}} its former size.|$|E

5|$|Born into {{a family}} of the Lincolnshire landed gentry, Boucherett became {{involved}} in local politics in Lincolnshire, and (owing mainly to his marriage) with artistic and mercantile circles in London. He {{was the chairman of}} the Grimsby Haven Company, which oversaw the reopening and expansion of Grimsby's first dock. He was a friend of the artist Sir Thomas Lawrence and the proprietor of Willingham, Lincolnshire, where he constructed his <b>country</b> <b>seat,</b> Willingham House, in 1790. For his investment in the Haven Company, he received the support of Lord Yarborough, one of its main investors and a principal land-owner in Grimsby; owing largely to Lord Yarborough's patronage, Boucherett was returned as the Member of Parliament for that borough at the 1796 election. He was not a frequent voter, but used his position to further the interests of his corporation. Nonetheless, the company met with financial difficulties after it opened the Harbour in 1800. In 1803, Boucherett resigned his seat in favour of Yarborough's heir and pursued a quieter political life. He died in a carriage accident in 1815.|$|E
