The mating type genes are located in homeobox and encode enzymes for production of pheromones and pheromone receptors.

Since sexual reproduction takes place in haploid organisms, it cannot proceed until <b>complementary</b> <b>genes</b> are provided by a suitable partner through cell or hyphal fusion.

Thus, we tried to isolate E. coli mutants deficient in the biosynthesis and their <b>complementary</b> <b>genes</b> by use of an artificial phenotypic screening system employing three carotenoid biosynthetic genes, crtE, crtB, and crtl. Cells were mutagenized with ethylmethanesulfonate, then transform-ed with a plasmid for expression of the carotenogenic genes. Mutants deficient in biosyn-thesis of isopentenyl diphosphate were expected to form white colonies, because {{they are unable to}} produce enough lycopene, whereas wild-type cells form red colonies. Among large numbers of red colonies, we identified 117 white colonies. Next, we transformed each mutant with an E. coli genomic library. Twenty-nine <b>complementary</b> <b>genes</b> that restore red color of host colonies were isolated. A homology search and further complementation study using subcloned genes revealed that the true <b>complementary</b> <b>genes</b> encode isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, subunits of ATP synthase, enzymes of the Krebs cycle, some aldehyde dehydrogenases, phosphate acetyltransferase, and enzymes which relate to the biosynthesis of ubiquinones and menaquinones.

40|$|The {{production}} of extreme or ‘transgressive ’ phenotypes in segregating hybrid populations {{has been speculated}} to contribute to niche divergence of hybrid lineages. Here, we assess the frequency of transgressive segregation in hybrid populations, describe its genetic basis and discuss the factors that best predict its occurrence. From a survey of 171 studies that report phenotypic variation in segregating hybrid populations, we show that transgression is the rule rather than the exception. In fact, 155 of the 171 studies (91 %) report at least one transgressive trait, and 44 % of 1229 traits examined were transgressive. Transgression occurred most frequently in intraspecific crosses involving inbred, domesticated plant populations, and least frequently in interspecific crosses between outbred, wild animal species.

40|$|SummaryAbout 12, 000 {{years ago}} in the Near East, humans began the {{transition}} from hunter-gathering to agriculture-based societies.

Independent recessive mutations in each of these genes caused cell wall thickening in a highly specific grain “disarticulation zone,” converting the brittle floral axis (the rachis) of the wild-type into a tough, non-brittle form that promoted grain retention. By tracing the evolutionary history of allelic variation in both genes, we conclude that spatially and temporally independent selections of germplasm with a non-brittle rachis were made during the domestication of barley by farmers in the southern and northern regions of the Levant, actions that made a major contribution to the emergence of early agrarian societies...|$|E
