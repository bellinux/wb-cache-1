40|$|OBJECTIVE: Major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) genes dominate genetic susceptibility factors in multiple sclerosis (MS). Given {{the general consensus}} that incidence and prevalence of MS has been rising and specifically in women, we evaluated MHC-gender interactions. METHODS: In a large family-based cohort consisting of 7, 093 individuals (2, 127 affected individuals) from 1, 055 MS families, we examined MHC transmission by family structure and gender stratified by genetic distance of affected relatives from the MS proband. RESULTS: We found that affected individuals with HLA-DRB 1 * 15 -positive genotypes have higher female-to-male ratios as compared with affected individuals with HLA-DRB 1 * 15 -negative genotypes (χ(2) = 9. 97, p = 0. 0015) {{with the exception of}} multiplex families with 3 or more affected across 2 generations. Transmission disequilibrium test results show that HLA-DRB 1 * 15 transmission was more distorted in <b>collateral</b> <b>families</b> vs nuclear families (χ(2) = 8. 030, p = 0. 0046), exclusively in affected female-female pairs (χ(2) = 7. 81, p = 0. 0051), but not in mixed gender pairs (χ(2) = 1. 58, p = 0. 21) or matched male pairs (Fisher p = 0. 21). CONCLUSIONS: These observations implicate the MHC as the site of interactions and modifications mediating the female-to-male gender ratio in MS and its progressive increase. They further suggest this occurs via gene-environment interactions and epigenetic modifications in this region. The difference between <b>collateral</b> and nuclear <b>families</b> provides some insight into the inheritance, decay, and gender specificity of putative epigenetic marks...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} work {{processes}} of racialized child welfare workers within hierarchical institutions and involves {{an understanding of}} several day-to-day child welfare activities such as case decisions, work training, court attendance, and work with families, as well as supervisors, co-workers and collaterals. While practicing, workers negotiate the power dimensions within the different and pre-determined work relations involving supervisors, colleagues, <b>collaterals,</b> <b>families</b> and children. The negotiating of power relations is complex and includes experiences of racial tension which are incorporated in the analysis. As the participants were {{both men and women}} with some workers being immigrants who had their own personal experiences of poverty, the analysis also recognizes the complexities of both gender and class. Part of the negotiation by the participants relates to addressing the tension that arises when their cultural values conflict with existing policies and laws, as well as institutional hierarchies. Drawing on Michel Foucault’s ideas of power, knowledge and the subject, this study analyzes the forms and uses of power through systems of differentiation, surveillance and hierarchical structures which provide a unique, relevant and applicable theoretical background to the understanding of race, gender, and class. The study adopts a qualitative methodology, an approach that allows for an exploration and understanding of the work experiences of racialized workers. The stories of the twenty-one participants involved in this research are significant and profound, and warrant attention. The study concludes that issues of race, gender and class alter perceptions and practice with families and thus calls for the integration of alternative ways of knowing within the dominant child welfare knowledge to better serve families and address experiences of tension by racialized child welfare workers...|$|R
50|$|Historically, Delhi {{located on}} the banks of the Yamuna River has been stated to be the Indraprastha city built by Pandavas of the Mahabharata epic period. Pandavas ruled from Indraprastha and Kauravas from Hastinapur (two <b>collateral</b> <b>families)</b> as per a {{brokered}} partition of the Kuru empire. But, in a dice game, Pandavas lost their Kingdom and were exiled for a 12-year term and in the 13th year must remain in hiding (with a rider that if they were detected during this period they would undergo the exile denovo). Mythological legend states that during the Pandavas' exile (imposed by their cousin Duryodhana of the Kaurava dynasty), in order to subdue Bhima’s (second of the five Pandava brothers) arrogance, Hanuman considered to be the brother of Bhima (both Vayu's children, appeared in the forest disguised as a weak and aged monkey. Bhima, while in search of a fragrant flower sought by Draupadi in the forest, found Hanuman lying with his tail blocking his way and, unaware of Hanuman’s identity, scornfully asked him to remove his tail. But Hanuman told Bhima to lift the tail since being old he was unable to do it on his own. Bhima tried hard several times but failed to lift it, in spite of being a man of great strength. Bhima then realized that the monkey was none other his own brother, apologizes for his arrogant behavior and requests Hanuman to show him his true form. Hanuman was then said to have enlarged himself and showed Bhima the size in which he had crossed the sea to go to Lanka, looking for Sita during the Ramayana epic period. After the Pandavas won the Kurukshetra war against the Kauravas and re - established themselves in Indraprastha, the Pandava clan is stated to have built five temples of Hanuman and other deities.|$|R

The study is vital because managers who control the funds given to the government of Cameroon to help reduce poverty are politicians and do not equitably distribute the funds to all on the pretext that the default rate is high. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find better ways to make additional capital available to the microbusiness owners of Buea to open or improve businesses. This qualitative case study design was consistent with the aim of understanding the importance of risk management within the microfinance industry and the risks involved in getting loans and paying them back. The key research question concerned how the microbusiness owners of Buea can obtain additional capital to open new businesses or improve existing businesses. The conceptual framework for this study was Rostow 2 ̆ 7 s theory of modernization. Twenty purposively sampled loan officers, bank managers, government officials, and microbusiness owners in Buea were interviewed. Six participants from the population also participated in a focus group. Study findings suggest it is possible for microbusiness owners in Buea to get microloans and start or improve businesses with the use of land titles as <b>collateral</b> or <b>family</b> members as cosigners. The government of Cameroon could improve the financial stability of microbusinesses by facilitating the issuance of land titles or certificates, which are acceptable forms of collateral.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore current practice, {{barriers}} and facilitators to identifying and responding to alcohol problems in memory clinics. Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire sent to professionals in 55 memory clinics in England, Wales and the Isle of Wight and two focus groups with professionals from three memory clinics in England. Findings – Only 1 / 35 clinics that responded to the questionnaire was using a standardised alcohol screening tool but all attempted to gain some information about alcohol use. Without screening tools, practitioners found it difficult to determine whether alcohol use was problematic. Barriers to identification/intervention included cognitive impairment, service-user being “on guard” during assessment, presence of family members/carers, time constraints and a perception that brief interventions were not within the remit of memory clinics. Facilitators were obtaining visual clues of problem drinking during home visits and <b>collateral</b> information from <b>family</b> members/carers. Research limitations/implications – Focus group participants were recruited through convenience sampling and a small number of professionals took part. This means that the findings may be subject to selection bias and limits the generalisability of the findings. Practical implications – Memory clinics should provide guidance and training for practitioners on how to intervene and respond to alcohol misuse. Further research is required to determine the most effective way to identify alcohol problems in people with cognitive impairment and how to deliver brief alcohol interventions that take account of cognitive deficits. Originality/value – This is the first study to examine alcohol screening and interventions in memory clinics and identifies a need for guidance, training and further research...|$|R

40|$|Context: Development {{of early}} {{intervention}} strategies and identification of high risk subjects may improve outcome in psychosis. Affective psychoses have been neglected by these advances. While prodrome to manic relapse {{has been extensively}} studied, {{little is known about}} prodrome to the initial manic episode. Aims: Description of symptoms and behaviours characterising the 12 months preceding a first manic episode (proximal markers) and identification of possible pre-morbid risk factors (distal markers). Method: Retrospective assessment of the 12 months preceding an initial manic episode with psychotic features in a cohort of 18 subjects with a semi-structured questionnaire and assessment of premorbid functioning, psychiatric history and life events with standardised scales. If possible, collection of <b>collateral</b> information from <b>family</b> or partners. Results: During the mean 22 weeks proximal prodromal period, patients presented mainly with disrupted sleep, mood lability, elevated mood, concentration difficulties, and to a lesser extend irritability, disinhibition and increased energy. While suggestive of a mood problem, these symptoms may prove insufficiently specific to identify high-risk patients in a general population. The presence of other characteristics in subjects presenting with such symptoms may however increase their significance: Progressive decrease in functional level starting during early adolescence, first degree relative with history of mood disorder or psychosis (observed in 61 % of patients), history of substance use disorder, history of significant life event. Additionally, variations of substance use could also be considered as a warning sign. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest the observation of a certain symptomatic profile in the context of risk factors should raise the suspicion of a possible impending first manic episode. These elements apply however only to the proximal prodrome to a first manic episode. The observation of a progressive deterioration in functioning staring about 8 to 10 years before onset of the first manic episode is in keeping with previous and suggests more work {{needs to be done in}} order to identify a more distal prodrome...|$|R

Trata-se de uma pesquisa qualitativa realizada com oito casais, sendo dois representantes de cada fase do ciclo vital. A coleta de dados foi feita por meio da entrevista semiestruturada e sua análise a partir da análise de conteúdo de Bardin, à luz da teoria bioecológica do desenvolvimento humano, do constructo resiliência e teoria sistêmica da família. Os resultados indicam que os fatores de riscos comuns aos casais ao longo da conjugalidade foram: dificuldades de adaptação frente as mudanças da vida,como dificuldades financeiras e seus desdobramentos [...] Os fatores de proteção que atuaram na superação destes desafios foram: amor e união entre o casal, modelo das famílias de origem e a espiritualidade enquanto crença. Entre as estratégias de enfrentamento disponíveis nos vários contextos nos quais os casais interagem destacaram-se: o apoio e modelos das famílias de origem/colateral e descendente e o diálogo e a participação em grupos religiosos/sociais contribuindo na dinâmica da conjugalidade e no desenvolvimento de atitudes resilientes nos casais.

Although much of this evidence suggests that music interventions are most effective when they are “individualized”, this type of intervention is often difficult to implement in large, busy, aged care facilities where residents may be located together in communal areas during the day. The challenge therefore is to try and identify a particular musical genre which, when played as “ambient” or “background” music, demonstrates a consistent capacity to reduce agitated behaviour in late-stage dementia across resident populations in multiple facilities. This study was designed to test the comparative utility of three different types of background music identified in the existing research literature as being of possible benefit in this context. These three types of music were: gentle classical music, familiar music and baroque music. Using a sample of 65 older people with late-stage dementia living in a total of eight residential aged care facilities, this quasi-experimental study used quantitative measures to assess a specific range of agitated behaviours over a one week intervention period. The specific agitated behaviours were documented using the Scale for the Observation of Agitation in Persons with Dementia (SOAP-D) scale (Hurley, Volicer, Camberg, Ashley, Woods, Odenheimer, Ooi, McIntyre, 2 ̆ 6 Mahoney, 1999). In addition, the Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD) tool (Logsdon, 1999) was used to collect <b>collateral</b> information from <b>family</b> members or experienced care staff at each of the participating facilities about whether they perceived that the playing of music exerted any influence on {{the quality of life of}} participants. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five experimental subgroups of equal size. Participants in three of the five groups received exposure to audio recordings of music. Participants in one of the two remaining sub-groups were exposed to a non-musical intervention (audio recordings of storybooks) at the same time of day as the participants in the three music groups. Data relating to behaviour and perceived quality of life were recorded in the same manner for this group. The final group of participants acted as the control group for the study. Quantitative data were collected in the same manner for this group: however, they were exposed to no intervention. In addition, a series of structured interviews was undertaken with experienced care providers at each of the participating residential aged care facilities. The purpose of this procedure was to determine whether the experiences and subjective opinions of staff regarding the utility of music as an intervention to settle agitated behaviour in late-stage dementia and improve quality of life were consistent with the observational data recorded using the SOAP-D scale in conjunction with the proxy-rated QoL-AD scale. Results of the study indicated that overall levels of agitated behaviour were less within the three groups exposed to music compared with the nonmusic intervention group and the control. However, perceived quality of life was not measurably improved in any of the three music intervention groups. This study supports the continued use of music as a therapeutic intervention in the management of maladaptive behaviour associated with late-stage dementia, although the results do not support the preferential use of any of the three selected music forms...|$|R
