2500|$|Later that morning, Whitman {{rented a}} hand truck and cashed $250 (...) worth of bad checks at a bank. He {{drove to a}} {{hardware}} store, where he purchased a Universal M1 carbine, two additional ammunition magazines, and eight boxes of ammunition, telling the cashier he planned to hunt wild hogs. At a gun shop he purchased four more carbine magazines, six additional boxes of ammunition, {{and a can of}} gun <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvent.</b> At Sears he purchased a Sears Model 60 12 gauge semi-automatic shotgun before returning home.|$|E
40|$|The {{elimination}} of CFC-containing <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents</b> for oxygen systems has prompted {{the development of}} a number of alternative <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents</b> that must now be evaluated not only for cleanability, but compatibility as well. NASA Handbook 8060. 1 (NHB 8060. 1) establishes the requirements for evaluation, testing, and selection of materials for use in oxygen rich environments. Materials intended for use in space vehicles, specified test facilities, and ground support equipment must meet the requirements of this document. In addition to the requirements of NHB 8060. 1 for oxygen service, alternative <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents</b> must also be evaluated in other areas (such as corrosivity, non-metals compatibility, non-volatile residue contamination, etc.). This paper will discuss the testing requirements of NHB 8060. 1 and present preliminary results from early screening tests performed at Marshall Space Flight Center's Materials Combustion Research Facility...|$|R
40|$|Although {{designed}} to remove organic contaminants {{from a variety}} of waste water streams, the planned U. S. - and present Russian-provided water processing systems onboard the International Space Station (ISS) have capacity limits for some of the more common volatile <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents</b> used for housekeeping purposes. Using large quantities of volatile <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents</b> during the ground processing and in-flight operational phases of a crewed spacecraft such as the ISS can lead to significant challenges to the water processing systems. To understand the challenges facing the management of water processing capacity, the relationship between cabin atmospheric quality and humidity condensate loading is presented. This relationship is developed as a tool to determine the cabin atmospheric loading that may compromise water processing system performance. A comparison of cabin atmospheric loading with volatile <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents</b> from ISS, Mir, and Shuttle are presented to predict acceptable limits to maintain optimal water processing system performance...|$|R
40|$|Accelerated {{bearing life}} tests were {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of ODC-free bearing <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents</b> as a replacement to CFC- 113. Three chemically different, ODC-free <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents</b> were tested against the CFC- 113 baseline. Test bearings were representative of the type {{that would be used}} for a space scanner bearing application. The bearings were lubricated with two space flight oils. Lives with the replacement solvents exceeded those obtained with CFC- 113 baseline. Pennzane-lubricated bearings enjoy a 2 to 6 X life advantage over those lubricated with Bray 815 Z oil...|$|R
2500|$|Multiple drafts is also {{attacked}} {{for making}} a claim to novelty. It may be the case, however, that such attacks mistake which features Dennett is claiming as novel. Korb states that, [...] "I believe that the central thesis will be relatively uncontentious for most cognitive scientists, but that its use as a <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvent</b> for messy puzzles will be viewed less happily in most quarters." [...] (Korb 1993) In this way, Dennett uses uncontroversial ideas towards more controversial ends, leaving him open to claims of unoriginality when uncontroversial parts are focused upon.|$|E
2500|$|... 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane is a {{non-flammable}} gas used {{primarily as a}} [...] "high-temperature" [...] refrigerant for domestic refrigeration and automobile air conditioners. [...] These devices began using 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane in the early 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the more environmentally harmful R-12 and retrofit kits are available to convert units that were originally R-12-equipped. [...] Other uses include plastic foam blowing, as a <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvent,</b> a propellant for the delivery of pharmaceuticals (e.g. bronchodilators), wine cork removers, gas dusters, such as Dust-Off, and in air driers for removing the moisture from compressed air. [...] 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane has also been used to cool computers in some overclocking attempts. It is the refrigerant used in plumbing pipe freeze kits. It is also commonly used as a propellant for airsoft airguns. The gas is often mixed with a silicon-based lubricant.|$|E
2500|$|The Cell was {{initially}} {{developed as a}} lower-cost alternative to conventional column flotation cells for recovering fine particles, and was first used in the Mount Isa lead–zinc concentrator in 1988. Since then, use of the technology has spread to include coal flotation, base and precious metal flotation, potash flotation, oil sands flotation, molybdenum flotation, graphite flotation and <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvent</b> extraction liquors. Xstrata Technology, Glencore Xstrata's technology marketing arm, listed 328 Jameson Cell installations in May 2013. Cells have been installed by 94 companies in 27 countries. Today, the technology is the standard in the Australian Coal Industry where well over one hundred Cells have been installed to recover coal fines. It is mainly used in metals applications to solve final grade and capacity issues from conventional cell cleaner circuits. It has [...] found a niche in transforming traditional circuit designs where its inclusion allows cleaner circuits to be designed with fewer cells in a smaller footprint, while achieving cleaner and/or higher grade concentrates. It has also made possible the recovery of previously discarded fine materials, such as coal and phosphate fines, thereby increasing the efficiency and extending {{the life of the}} world's non-renewable natural resources.|$|E

40|$|Components in the {{aerospace}} industry must perform with accuracy and precision under extreme conditions, and surface contamination can be detrimental to the desired performance, especially in cases when the components {{come into contact with}} strong oxidizers such as liquid oxygen. Therefore, precision cleaning {{is an important part of}} a components preparation prior to utilization in aerospace applications. Current cleaning technologies employ a variety of cleaning agents, many of which are halogenated solvents that are either toxic or cause environmental damage. Thus, this project seeks to identify alternative precision <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents</b> and technologies, including use of less harmful <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents,</b> ultrasonic and megasonic agitation, low-pressure plasma cleaning techniques, and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction.

50|$|Stoddard solvent is a {{specific}} mixture of hydrocarbons, typically > 65% C10 or higher hydrocarbons, developed in 1924 by Atlanta dry cleaner W. J. Stoddard and Lloyd E. Jackson of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research as a less volatile petroleum-based dry <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvent</b> than the petroleum solvents then in use. Dry cleaners began using the result of their work in 1928 and it soon became the predominant dry <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvent</b> in the United States, until the late 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Resistance {{to water}} and {{solvents}} {{is critical in}} some applications. For example, in textile industry, resistance to dry <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents</b> may be required.

50|$|Before {{they became}} {{strictly}} regulated, {{the general public}} often encountered haloalkanes as paint and <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents</b> such as trichloroethane (1,1,1-trichloroethane) and carbon tetrachloride (tetrachloromethane), pesticides like 1,2-dibromoethane (EDB, ethylene dibromide), and refrigerants like Freon-22 (duPont trademark for chlorodifluoromethane). Some haloalkanes are still widely used for industrial cleaning, such as methylene chloride (dichloromethane), and as refrigerants, such as R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane).|$|R
50|$|Its {{increasing}} {{use in the}} 21st century {{resulted from}} the need for a substitute for chlorofluorocarbons and perchloroethylene (tetrachloroethylene) as a dry <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvent.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The phrase Russian twist {{can be used}} to {{indicate}} a special case that applies to Russia. An example is a case where smugglers bought grain alcohol from the US and smuggled it into Russia, disguising it as windshield-wiper fluid or <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvent.</b>|$|E
50|$|In July 1990, a <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvent</b> leak at the BASF {{chemical}} {{plant on the}} border of Norwood and Evanston resulted in a massive explosion, killing two and injuring 90 people. The blast heavily damaged Norwood businesses on Montgomery Road and affected Norwood homes as far as a mile away.|$|E
50|$|The hot mop (or steam mop) {{follows a}} similar concept to a steam iron. After adding water, {{the water is}} heated to make it exude {{on top of a}} floor, which can then be cleaned without using a <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvent.</b> These can work best on {{surfaces}} where a regular mop would also be used, such as bare floors, hearths, and laminate.|$|E
50|$|Basic {{mechanical}} cleaning can remove dirt, dust, and grime. <b>Cleaning</b> <b>solvents</b> and water {{can also be}} used to remove dirt, varnish, wax, in-painting, or adhesives. Acids should be used with caution. Desalination is a cleaning method that removes as much soluble salt from the porous fired clay as possible. Fragments are soaked in highly purified water for multiple days. The water is changed regularly until salt levels are reduced.|$|R
50|$|A {{child safety}} lock is a {{special-purpose}} lock for cabinets, drawers, bottles, etc. {{that is designed}} to help prevent children from getting at any dangerous contents. Young children are naturally curious about their surroundings and will always explore, but as they may be unaware of dangerous substances or situations, the results can be fatal. Numerous cases of poisoning have resulted from eating brightly colored pills or spilling <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents.</b>|$|R
40|$|Increasingly strict {{environmental}} regulations {{and the consequent}} phase out of many effective <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvents</b> has necessitated the development of novel cleaning chemistries and technologies. Among these is vacuum degreasing, a fully enclosed process that eliminates fugitive solvent emissions, thereby reducing cost, environmental, and health related exposure impacts. The effectiveness of vacuum degreasing using modified alcohol for common aerospace contaminants is reported and compared to current and legacy solvents...|$|R
50|$|Ultrasonic {{cleaning}} is {{a process}} that uses ultrasound (usually from 20-400 kHz) and an appropriate <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvent</b> (sometimes ordinary tap water) to clean items. The ultrasound can be used with just water, but use of a solvent appropriate for the item to be cleaned and the type of soiling present enhances the effect. Cleaning normally lasts between three and six minutes, but can also exceed 20 minutes, depending on the object to be cleaned.|$|E
5000|$|... γ-Butyrolactone (GBL) is a {{hygroscopic}} colorless liquid {{with a weak}} characteristic odor and profoundly disgusting taste. Soluble in water, GBL is {{a common}} solvent and reagent in chemistry {{as well as being}} used as a flavouring, as a <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvent,</b> as a superglue remover, and as a solvent in some wet aluminium electrolytic capacitors. In humans it acts as a prodrug for γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and it is used as a recreational intoxicant with effects similar to alcohol.|$|E
50|$|Commonly, a breech-end {{extension}} tube, {{known as}} a bore guide or rod guide, is also {{used in conjunction with}} the cleaning rod to prevent <b>cleaning</b> <b>solvent</b> from spilling out into the receiver, and to keep the rod supported and centered inside the bore in order to minimize potential damage to riflings. Similarly, a muzzle guide or muzzle guard might be used if the cleaning rod is to be inserted from the muzzle end of the firearm {{in order to protect the}} crown of the muzzle from mechanical damage.|$|E
