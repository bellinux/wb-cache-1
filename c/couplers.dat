In addition to these modifications, the tilt angle of the bogies will be lowered from the current eight degrees.

5|$|The Pendolino has {{received}} bad publicity {{since the first}} units were taken in service for its serious reliability issues, mostly caused by technical problems with the tilting system and the <b>couplers.</b> The coupling problems grew particularly important with {{the expansion of the}} Pendolino network in 2006, requiring rapid on-the-fly coupling of two trains at intersection stations. Because the units often could not be coupled the train units had to be run as two separate trains running one after another. This consumed one extra train slot on the heavily used rail sections causing cascading timetable delays. Sometimes two trains would not separate after coupling them, caused by moisture in the <b>couplers.</b> Due to the problems VR ended the practice of coupling Pendolino trains on-the-fly at the two intersection stations; in Tampere in late 2007 and in Kouvola during autumn 2008.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak ordered another seven Turboliner trainsets, {{which were}} {{delivered}} between 1976 and 1977. These were manufactured by Rohr Industries, and {{were known as}} RTL Turboliners. They {{were based on the}} earlier RTG series, but had American-style Janney <b>couplers</b> throughout and a different design of power car cab. The standard configuration of each set was five cars: power cars at either end, a food service car, and two coaches. In that configuration, each trainset could carry 264 passengers. At times, Amtrak operated Turboliners with an additional coach cut into the consist. These were the final gas turbine trainsets purchased by Amtrak; conventional diesel locomotive-hauled trains proved cheaper to operate.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter than {{conventional}} trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their trucks with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only {{reduced the number of}} trucks under the train, but it also dispensed with the need for <b>couplers</b> between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.|$|E

Technology advancements continued, with 3 position automatic signals introduced in 1915, the conversion of screw couplings to knuckle <b>couplers</b> from 1924, and the first remote controlled signalling provided in 1925.

5|$|While {{the rolling}} stock and Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} equipment were constructed in Japan, many parts were sourced from Europe. The trains were fitted with Stone Platt air-conditioning, Duwag bogies, Sig gangways, Scharfenberg <b>couplers</b> and Westinghouse brakes. Mitsubishi Electric's propulsion equipment was estimated to consume 50% less electricity than Hong Kong's existing MTR M-Train EMU. Its Automatic Train Control (ATC) signalling system was supplied by Westinghouse, capable of running at pre-programmed speeds and activated by the train driver. While theoretically possible to design for a fully driverless operation using this signalling technology, MRT Corporation (MRTC, now SMRT Corporation) decided against this option. The trainsets were assembled in Kobe, Japan, and then shipped to Singapore by Neptune Orient Lines. The first trainset was delivered to MRTC on 8 July 1986 at Bishan Depot, officiated by Yeo Ning Hong.|$|E

The area of the proposed rat-race <b>coupler</b> compared with the conventional structure, the proposed rat-race <b>coupler</b> in this paper has smaller size than the conventional structure. The main outcome of this work is reducing the area of the proposed <b>coupler</b> by 10 %. Microwave Office (MWO- 225 -SUF) tool is used to execute the design of the <b>coupler</b> in this work. Recently, wireless communication systems usually require smaller device size in order to meet circuit miniaturization and cost reduction. Thus, size reduction is becoming major design considerations for practical applications. However, in the low microwave frequency range, even the physically small size of a conventional hybrid <b>coupler</b> is still too large for some applications. Therefore, attempts continually are made to reduce its size. Lots of attempts are continually contributed to minimize the occupied area of hybrid <b>coupler</b> [6, 7].
