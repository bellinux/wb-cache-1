25|$|A {{breakout}} dock is conceptually {{a breakout}} {{box in the}} form of a dock. It is an extension to a typical port replicator in that it not only replicates existing ports already on the computer, but also offers additional ports. Modern computers most often accomplish this by using a special, often proprietary, connector that consolidates the signals from many concealed traces from onboard external buses into one connector. As such, the dock <b>can</b> <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> greater number of ports than is physically present on the computer. This allows the basic unit to have fewer physical ports while still allowing users a way to access to the full range of features of its motherboard.|$|E
25|$|A common {{aspect of}} {{recovery}} {{is said to}} be the presence of others who believe in the person's potential to recover, and who stand by them. While mental health professionals <b>can</b> <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> particular limited kind of relationship and help foster hope, relationships with friends, family and the community are said to often be of wider and longer-term importance. Others who have experienced similar difficulties, who may be on a journey of recovery, can be of particular importance. Those who share the same values and outlooks more generally (not just in the area of mental health) may also be particularly important. It is said that one-way relationships based on being helped can actually be devaluing, and that reciprocal relationships and mutual support networks can be of more value to self-esteem and recovery.|$|E
25|$|Takeover paper. Convertibles have a {{place as}} the {{currency}} used in takeovers. The bidder <b>can</b> <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> higher income on a convertible than the dividend yield on a bid victim’s shares, without having to raise the dividend yield on all the bidder’s shares. This eases the process for a bidder with low-yield shares acquiring a company with higher-yielding shares. Perversely, the lower the yield on the bidder’s shares, {{the easier it is}} for the bidder to create a higher conversion premium on the convertible, with consequent benefits for the mathematics of the takeover. In the 1980s, UK domestic convertibles accounted for about 80pct of the European convertibles market, and over 80pct of these were issued either as takeover currency or as funding for takeovers.

25|$|Cost–benefit {{analysis}} {{is often used}} by organizations to appraise the desirability of a given policy. It is {{an analysis of the}} expected balance of benefits and costs, including an account of foregone alternatives and the status quo. CBA helps predict whether the benefits of a policy outweigh its costs, and by how much relative to other alternatives, so that one can rank alternate policies in terms of the cost–benefit ratio. Generally, accurate cost–benefit analysis identifies choices that increase welfare from a utilitarian perspective. Assuming an accurate CBA, changing the status quo by implementing the alternative with the lowest cost–benefit ratio can improve Pareto efficiency. While CBA <b>can</b> <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> well-educated estimate of the best alternative – perfect appraisal of all present and future costs and benefits is difficult –, perfection in terms of economic efficiency and social welfare are not guaranteed.|$|E
25|$|General Electric (GE) stated {{it would}} not offer the GP7000 engine on the aircraft, and that {{previous}} contracts for the GEnx on the original A350 {{did not apply to}} the XWB. Engine Alliance partner Pratt & Whitney seemed to be at odds with GE on this, having publicly stating that it was looking at an advanced derivative of the GP7000. In April 2007, Airbus former chief executive Louis Gallois held direct talks with GE management over developing a GEnx variant for the A350 XWB. In June 2007, Airbus's chief operating officer John Leahy indicated that the A350 XWB would not feature the GEnx engine, saying that Airbus wanted GE to offer a more efficient version for the airliner. Since then, the largest GE engines operators, which include Emirates, US Airways, Hawaiian Airlines and ILFC have selected the Trent XWB for their A350 orders. In May 2009, GE said that if it were to reach a deal with Airbus to offer the current 787-optimised GEnx for the A350, it would only power the -800 and -900 variants. GE believed it <b>can</b> <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> product that outperforms the Trent 1000 and Trent XWB, but was reluctant to support an aircraft competing directly with its GE90-115B-powered 777 variants.|$|E
