5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for forced prostitution around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by <b>child</b> <b>abandonment</b> and orphanages.|$|E
5|$|The Tapas Seven {{were interviewed}} by Leicestershire police in England in April 2008, with the Polícia Judiciária in attendance.

The poor relationship between the McCanns and Portuguese police was evident again that month when, {{on the day the}} couple were at the European Parliament to promote a monitoring system for missing children, transcripts of their interviews with the Polícia Judiciária were leaked to Spanish television. The national director of the Polícia Judiciária, Alípio Ribeiro, resigned not long after this, citing media pressure from the investigation; he had publicly said the police had been hasty in naming the McCanns as suspects.

40|$|Protection {{is pleased}} to present to you the Florida Child Abuse Prevention and Permanency Plan: January 2009 – June 2010. Connecting our {{communities}} and empowering families will strengthen Florida’s children and prevent them from ever entering into foster care {{as a result of}} <b>child</b> abuse, <b>abandonment</b> and neglect. If in this we fail, we must make certain that a child’s time in our foster care system is as temporary as possible. With a sense of urgency, Florida’s foster children must be safely placed with permanent families, either through reunification with their biological families or by placing them into loving and nurturing adoptive families. This plan reflects our commitment to engage state agencies and local communities in a collaborative effort to prevent <b>child</b> abuse, <b>abandonment</b> and neglect; promote adoption; and support our adoptive families. Through their Legislature, the people of the State of Florida have determined that, “…the prevention of <b>child</b> abuse, <b>abandonment</b> and neglect shall be a priority of this state. ” To this end, the Office convened the Child Abuse Prevention and Permanency Advisory Council to embark on the development of Florida’s 18 -month statewide plan on prevention and permanency.

25|$|Europe's {{cultural}} makeover {{marked a}} period of significant innovation for adoption. Without support from the nobility, the practice gradually shifted toward abandoned <b>children.</b> <b>Abandonment</b> levels rose {{with the fall of}} the empire and many of the foundlings were left on the doorstep of the Church. Initially, the clergy reacted by drafting rules to govern the exposing, selling, and rearing of abandoned children. The Church's innovation, however, was the practice of oblation, whereby children were dedicated to lay life within monastic institutions and reared within a monastery. This created the first system in European history in which abandoned children did not have legal, social, or moral disadvantages. As a result, many of Europe's abandoned and orphaned children became alumni of the Church, which in turn took the role of adopter. Oblation marks the beginning of a shift toward institutionalization, eventually bringing about the establishment of the foundling hospital and orphanage.|$|R
25|$|Slavery {{was known}} in almost every ancient civilization and society {{including}} Sumer, Ancient Egypt, Ancient China, the Akkadian Empire, Assyria, Ancient India, Ancient Greece, the Roman Empire, the Hebrew kingdoms of the ancient Levant, and the pre-Columbian civilizations of the Americas. Such institutions included debt-slavery, punishment for crime, the enslavement of prisoners of war, <b>child</b> <b>abandonment,</b> {{and the birth of}} slave children to slaves.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} targeted rising divorce rates, {{and made}} divorce more difficult—it was decreed that a marriage could be dissolved only in exceptional cases. By the late 1960s, the population began to swell. In turn, {{a new problem}} was created by <b>child</b> <b>abandonment,</b> which swelled the orphanage population (see Cighid). Transfusions of untested blood led to Romania accounting for many of Europe's pediatric HIV/AIDS cases {{at the turn of}} the 21st century despite having a population that only comprises 3% of Europe's population.|$|E
25|$|In ancient times, abortion, {{along with}} infanticide, was {{considered}} {{in the context of}} family planning, gender selection, population control, and the property rights of the patriarch. Rarely were the rights of the prospective mother, much less the prospective child, taken into consideration. Although generally legal, the morality of abortion, birth control and <b>child</b> <b>abandonment</b> (as a form of infanticide) was sometimes discussed. Then, as now, these discussions often concerned the nature of man, the existence of a soul, when life begins, and the beginning of human personhood.|$|E
50|$|Rodríguez {{returned}} to Costa Rica and began {{teaching at the}} Escuela de Aplicación de Heredia, directed by Omar Dengo and later at the Normal School, the Liceo de Costa Rica, and {{was director of the}} Superior School for Young Ladies. She began writing and publishing numerous pieces in newspapers, including political essays and literary criticisms. From at least as early as 1922, she was publishing articles in the American Repertory criticizing the treatment of women and <b>children,</b> <b>abandonment</b> of <b>children,</b> alcoholism, as well as analyses of international politics. She also directed the Biblical Institute and served {{as the director of the}} Inter-American Office of Education. In 1923, the Liga Feminista Costarricense (LFC), first feminist organization in Costa Rica, was founded by Ángela Acuña Braun and Rodríguez joined the organization. She was involved in many protests of the league's protests with Acuña, Ana Rosa Chacón and Carmen Lyra.

25|$|Slavery {{was widely}} practiced in pre-Islamic Arabia, {{as well as}} in the rest of the ancient and early medieval world. The {{minority}} were white slaves of foreign extraction, likely brought in by Arab caravaners (or the product of Bedouin captures) stretching back to biblical times. Native Arab slaves had also existed, a prime example being Zayd ibn Harithah, later to become Muhammad's adopted son. Arab slaves, however, usually obtained as captives, were generally ransomed off amongst nomad tribes. The slave population increased by the custom of <b>child</b> <b>abandonment</b> (see also infanticide), and by the kidnapping, or, occasionally, the sale of small children. There is no conclusive evidence of the existence of enslavement for debt or the sale of children by their families; the late and rare accounts of such occurrences show them to be abnormal, Brunschvig states (According to Brockopp, debt slavery was persistent.) Free persons could sell their offspring, or even themselves, into slavery. Enslavement was also possible as a consequence of committing certain offenses against the law, as in the Roman Empire.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, <b>child</b> <b>abandonment</b> {{remained}} a significant social isssue in the period, with foundling hospitals, orphanages specifically for abandoned children, a common focus of charitable activity by the rich. [...] The seal of the London Foundling Hospital showed the scene, {{and the artist}} Francis Hayman gave them his painting of the subject, where it hung next to William Hogarth's painting of a slightly later episode of the young Moses and the princess. [...] We know a depiction by Charles de La Fosse {{was one of a}} pair of biblical subjects commissioned in 1701 for the billiards room at the Palace of Versailles, paired with Eliezer and Rebecca; possibly the idea was to encourage those winning bets on the game to give their winnings to charity.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992 the Government of India {{started the}} [...] "baby cradle scheme".

The scheme has been praised for possibly saving the lives of thousands of baby girls but also criticised by human rights groups, who say that the scheme encourages <b>child</b> <b>abandonment</b> and also reinforces the low status in which women are held. The scheme, which was piloted in Tamil Nadu, saw cradles placed outside state-operated health facilities. The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu added another incentive, giving money to families that had more than one daughter. 136 baby girls were given for adoption during the first four years of the scheme. In 2000, 1,218 cases of female infanticide were reported, the scheme was deemed a failure and it was abandoned. It was reinstated in the following year.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study is to identify the main representations {{of the process of}} the international adoption through a comparative analysis of the Italian fairy tales and stories used to talk about their adoption to adopted children, from 4 to 10 years old. The sample of the study includes 50 Italian fairy tales and stories, written since 1995 up to now, that tell the adopted children something about their origin and their adoption. The verbatim of the tales and the stories were analyzed through content analysis, both using a computer assisted text analysis program (T-Lab) and a thematic analysis of each story. The main results show the very different images of the various protagonists - adoptive parents, adopted child, birth mother, birth country, “bridge” caregivers (operators of institutes, or houses for children or foster families in the birth country…), social and legal operators both in the birth country and in the adoptive one… The two moments of the "beginning" of the story and of its "happy ending" result topical, together with the crucial description of the “first meeting” and the attribution of responsibility to someone for the <b>child’s</b> <b>abandonment.</b> The representational quality of the narrative productions created by adoptive parents or used with them in the post adoption groups is very important because {{it is one of the}} tools that communicate the image of adoption to adopted children. It can vary from a polarized image - all the positive pertains to the adoptive world and all the negative to the world of the origins - or a better integrated image, with positive aspects both in the adoptive and in the birth worlds...|$|R
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by Robert Graves and others that in the earliest Ur-myth of the hero, he was called Oedipais: [...] "child of the swollen sea." [...] He was so named because of the method by which his birth parents tried to abandon him—by placing him in a chest and tossing it into the ocean. The mythic topos of forsaking a child to the sea or a river is well attested, found (e.g.) in the myths of Perseus, Telephus, Dionysus, Romulus and Remus and Moses. Over the centuries, however, Oedipais {{seems to have been}} corrupted into the familiar Oedipus: [...] "swollen foot." [...] And it was this new name that might have inspired the addition of a bizarre element to the story of Oedipus' abandonment on Mt. Cithaeron. Exposure on a mountain was in fact a common method of <b>child</b> <b>abandonment</b> in Ancient Greece. It can thus be argued that the ankle-binding was grafted onto the Oedipus myth to update its relevance.|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, Final Fantasy VI {{moved away}} from the medieval setting of its predecessors, instead being set in a steampunk environment,. The game {{received}} considerable acclaim, and is seen {{as one of the greatest}} RPGs of all time, for improvements such as its broadened thematic scope, plotlines, characters, multiple-choice scenarios, and variation of play. Final Fantasy VI dealt with mature themes such as suicide, war crimes, <b>child</b> <b>abandonment,</b> teen pregnancy, and coping with the deaths of loved ones. [...] Square's Live A Live, released for the Super Famicom in Japan, featured eight different characters and stories, with the first seven unfolding in any order the player chooses, as well as four different endings. The game's ninja chapter in particular was an early example of stealth game elements in an RPG, requiring the player to infiltrate a castle, rewarding the player if the entire chapter can be completed without engaging in combat. Other chapters had similar innovations, such as Akira's chapter where the character uses telepathic powers to discover information. That same year saw the release of the 3DO console port of the 1991 PC RPG Knights of Xentar, which had introduced a unique pausable real-time battle system, where characters automatically attack based on a list of different AI scripts chosen by the player. Robotrek by Quintet and Ancient was a predecessor to Pokémon in the sense that the protagonist does not himself fight, but sends out his robots to do so. Like Pokémon, Robotrek was designed to appeal to a younger audience, allowed team customization, and each robot was kept in a ball.|$|E

O que importa aqui é trazer para a educação um debate contemporâneo sobre as imagens que nos cercam cotidianamente, especialmente quando têm como mote a narrativa sobre a infância. Assim, num primeiro momento, são apresentados alguns elementos da constituição dessa linguagem específica. Em seguida, passase à análise dos filmes em questão e, em especial, à forma como são dadas as relações de veracidade a partir das imagens e da construção das respectivas narrativas. Paralelamente a isso, discutese, mais amplamente, sobre imagens que nos fazem pensar na medida em que colocam, lado a lado, crianças, abandono, miséria e morte.

Firstly, I expose some elements of the constitution of that particular language, as well as some of the changes that were and are being made in this film genre. Then I move on to the analysis of the aforementioned films and, in particular, the way the relations of credibility derived from the images and the construction of their corresponding narratives take place.
