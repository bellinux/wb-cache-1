5|$|Apart {{from the}} single-player story, Undead Nightmare adds two {{multiplayer}} modes: Undead Overrun and Land Grab.

It is also designed so as to encourage cooperation such that players can revive each other if nearby. The other mode, Land Grab, is an additional game mode within the main game's multiplayer free roam and otherwise unconnected to the undead theme. In Land Grab, players attempt to secure seven areas across the game's environment. While players with the base game can join in Land Grab games, only Undead Nightmare owners can initiate them.|$|E
