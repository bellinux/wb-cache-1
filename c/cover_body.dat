6000|$|One may {{guess that}} the {{original}} pinch at the waist of the Mycenaean shield was evolved later into the two deep scoops to enable the warrior to use his arms more freely, while the shield, hanging from his neck by a belt, covered {{the front of his}} body. Fig. 4 shows shields of 1060-1160 A.D. equally designed to <b>cover</b> <b>body</b> and legs. Men wore shields, if we believe the artists of Mycenae, when lion-hunting, a sport in which speed of foot is desirable; so they cannot have been very weighty. The shield then was hung over one side, and running was not so very difficult as if it hung over back or front (cf. Fig. 5). The shields sometimes reach only from the shoulders to the calf of the leg. [Footnote: Reichel, p. 3, fig. 5, Grave III. at Mycenae.] The wearer of the largest kind could only be got at by a sword-stab over the rim into the throat [Footnote: Ibid., p. 2, fig. 2.] (Fig. 5). Some shields of this shape were quite small, if an engraved rock-crystal is evidence; here the shield is not half so high as an adjacent goat, but it may be a mere decoration to fill the field of the gem.

50|$|Muslim {{males are}} {{encouraged}} to grow their beards and trim the moustache. Men in some Muslim communities wear turban (head cap). Muslim men, as well as women, must dress modestly. For Muslim women, it is highly recommended to cover their hair. Muslim women are required to <b>cover</b> <b>body</b> in public, with some Islamic scholars stating that the Islamic Hadiths require covering the face too. These restrictions are called 'Hijab'. Islam encourages gender segregation in public, and Muslim men and women do not usually mix in public places such as mosques. These restrictions are part of 'Adab'.|$|E
50|$|The weapon feeds {{from the}} left side from open-link, metal {{ammunition}} belts: either the American disintegrating M13 belt (NATO standard) or the segmented German DM1 belt, whose 50-round sections can be linked through a cartridge. In order to adapt the weapon to feed from one belt type to the other, several components of the feed mechanism need to be reconfigured since the position of the feed tray's cartridge stop and pawl angles in the top cover are different. The MAG features a pawl-type feeding mechanism that continues to move the feed link during both the rearward and forward cycles of the reciprocating bolt carrier, producing a smooth belt flow. The feeding mechanism's three pawls are actuated by a roller connected to the bolt carrier. The feed channel rail, feed link, both feed slides and the feed tray are chrome plated. The top <b>cover</b> <b>body</b> is an anodized aluminum casting. In the infantry assault role, the weapon can be fitted with a sheet metal container that houses a 50-round belt and is attached to {{the left side of the}} receiver.|$|E

5000|$|Late in 1971, Ford began {{importing}} Panteras for the American {{market to}} be sold through its Lincoln Mercury dealers. The first 75 cars were simply European imports and {{are known for their}} [...] "push-button" [...] door handles and hand-built Carrozzeria Vignale bodies. A total of 1,007 Panteras reached the United States that first year. As with most Italian cars of the day, rust-proofing was minimal and the quality of fit and finish on these early models was poor with large amounts of body solder being used to <b>cover</b> <b>body</b> panel flaws. Subsequently, Ford increased their involvement in the production of the later cars with the introduction of precision stampings for body panels which resulted in improved overall quality. Several modifications were made for the 1972 model year Panteras. A new 4 Bolt Main Cleveland Engine, also 351 cu in, was used with lower compression ratio (from 11:1 to 8.6:1, chiefly to meet US emissions standards and run on lower octane standard fuel) but with the more aggressive [...] "Cobra Jet" [...] camshaft (featuring the same lift and duration as the 428 Cobra Jet's factory performance cam) in an effort to reclaim some of the power lost through the reduction in compression along with a dual point distributor. Many other engine changes were made, including the use of a factory exhaust header.|$|E

40|$|The most {{frequently}} used instruments for health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with osteoporosis are the Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO- 41) and the Osteoporosis Assessment Questionnaire (OPAQ 2. 0 and OPAQ SV). Since HRQL- and International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) -based approaches have both strengths and weaknesses, {{it is expected that}} they will be used simultaneously in clinical practice and research. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between osteoporosis-targeted instruments and the ICF. All three selected instruments <b>cover</b> <b>body</b> functions, including pain in back and emotional functions. Sleep functions and energy are represented in the QUALEFFO- 41 and OPAQ 2. 0 but not in the OPAQ SV. Body structures and environmental factors are covered only by the OPAQ 2. 0 and OPAQ SV. The ICF provides an excellent framework when comparing the content of osteoporosis-targeted HRQL instruments and may be useful when selecting health status instruments for clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of the Swiss Spinal Cord Injury Cohort Study (SwiSCI) is {{to gain a better}} {{understanding}} of how to support functioning, health maintenance, and quality-of-life of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) along the continuum of care, in the community, and along their life span. The purpose of this study was to present the SwiSCI study design. SwiSCI is composed of three complementary pathways and will include Swiss persons 16 yrs or older who have diagnoses of traumatic or nontraumatic SCI. Pathway 1 is a retrospective study of medical files of patients admitted to one of the collaborating SCI centers between 2005 and 2009. Pathway 2 is a nationwide survey of persons with chronic SCI. Pathway 3 is an inception cohort study including persons with newly acquired SCI. SwiSCI is conducted in collaboration with the Swiss Paraplegic Association and the major specialized rehabilitation centers in Switzerland. Measurement instruments that are to be used in Pathway 2 and 3 <b>cover</b> <b>body</b> structures and functions, activities, participation, life satisfaction, and personal and environmental factors. SwiSCI is a prospective cohort study that will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the lived experience of persons with SCI...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – To be able {{to apply}} all four types of {{knowledge}} conversion (socialization, internalization, externisation and combination) during formal education, {{for the purpose of}} developing appropriate attitudes, knowledge, skills, intuition, and creativity, it is necessary to have the work of students on real projects. Real projects, however, are never limited by boundaries of a single case. They often <b>cover</b> <b>body</b> of knowledge in various subjects, from different years of study, and even study programs. The real work is also very team, where each team member perform tasks in their domain of expertise. This implies that the project must participate with students of different subjects, majors, years of study and even different schools. To facilitate the coordination of such projects, special software was developed –as Web applications. Application itself provides a classic project management, and collaboration and cooperation of a number of teachers and students that can be spatially distant, as well as basic educational components-monitoring student achievement, their evaluation and self-evaluation, assistance in teamwork, and learning through trial and error method, analysis of the literature, brain-storming and team participation. In this paper, the possibilities of application are presented, a description of its use is given, and the importance and usefulness of the usage of such applications is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} {{psychometric properties of the}} Health and Functioning ICF- 60 (HF-ICF- 60) measure, based on the World Health Organization (WHO) ‘Interna-tional Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health: ICF ’ (2001). The aims of the present study were to test psychometric properties of the HF-ICF- 60, developed as a measure that would be respon-sive to change in functioning through changes in health and nutritional status, as a prospective measure to monitor health and nutritional status of populations and to explore the relationship of the HF-ICF- 60 with quality of life measures such as the World Health Organization WHOQOL-BREF quality of life assessment in relation to non-communicable diseases. Methods: The HF-ICF- 60 measure consists of 60 items selected from the ICF by an expert panel, which included 18 items that <b>cover</b> <b>Body</b> Functions, 21 items that cover Activities and Participation, rated on five-point scales, and 21 items that cover Environmental Factors (seven items cover Individual Environmental Factors and 14 items cover Societal Environmental Factors), rated on nine-point scales. The HF-ICF- 60 measure was administered to the Russian nationally representative sample within the Russian National Population Quality of Life, Health and Nutrition Survey, in 2004 (n= 9807) and 2005 (n= 9560), as part of the two waves of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS).

40|$|Changes in {{morphological}} traits, such as body size, body condition, and leg length, {{are important}} indicators of changes to life history or habitat quality, which {{can affect the}} performance of individuals and therefore the persistence of populations under environmental change. Only very few studies assessed the effect of fragmentation on morphological traits. The few available studies on anurans found that in landscapes with less forest <b>cover</b> <b>body</b> size decreased. Therefore, we predict that body size should also be smaller in fragments compared to continuous forest. Body condition is a further trait closely related to individual performance and thus should decline with more adverse conditions, as is expected in fragments. We tested these hypotheses using snout-vent length, body mass, body condition, and tibia length as response variables. We collected data of a habitat generalist (Rhinella ornata) and a habitat specialist (Ischnocnema guentheri), both leaf-litter amphibian species, from three sites in a fragmented landscape (two isolated and one connected site) and one site in a contiguous part of the Atlantic Forest of Southeast Brazil. In the generalist species, snout-vent-length (SVL) and body mass were significantly lower in fragments compared to the contiguous forest control, whereas tibia length and body condition did not differ among sites. In contrast, SVL, body mass, and tibia length of the specialist species did not differ among sites, but body condition was marginally different among sites, being relatively low in one but not the other isolated fragment. The results indicate that different processes affect the morphology of the two species following habitat fragmentation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Obstructive Sleep Apnea is {{increasingly}} {{seen as a}} common and important condition, contributing to sleep disturbance and consequential daytime sleepiness. According to recent research findings, the best predictors of morbidity in individual patients, as assessed by improvements with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure therapy), are nocturnal oxygen saturation and movements during sleep. Although pulse oximetry is a well-established technique to analyze oxygen saturation, video monitoring and interpretation is less well developed both from a processing and analysis viewpoint. This {{is due to the}} relative computational complexity of video processing analysis, as well as application-related technical challenges, involving night vision, the body being obscured by cover, variation on human size and behavior and massive video and audio data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to locate upper body parts of the <b>covered</b> human <b>body.</b> The locations of the upper body parts allow further analysis of <b>covered</b> <b>body</b> postures and human activity recognition in sleep. The experimental results show that the proposed model is promising to estimate the head and torso locations of the <b>covered</b> human <b>body</b> with various postures, body activities and filming environmental settings.
