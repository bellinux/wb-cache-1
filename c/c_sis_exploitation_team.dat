The as-grown products were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Studies reveal that a typical hierarchical <b>Cd</b> 4 <b>SiS</b> 6 /SiO 2 heterostructure nanowire {{is composed of}} a single crystalline <b>Cd</b> 4 <b>SiS</b> 6 nanowire core sheathed with amorphous SiO 2 sheath. Furthermore, secondary nanostructures of SiO 2 nanowires are highly dense grown on the primary <b>Cd</b> 4 <b>SiS</b> 6 core-SiO 2 sheath nanowires and formed hierarchical <b>Cd</b> 4 <b>SiS</b> 6 /SiO 2 based heterostructure nanowire arrays which stand vertically on silicon substrates. The possible growth mechanism of hierarchical <b>Cd</b> 4 <b>SiS</b> 6 /SiO 2 heterostructure nanowire arrays is proposed.

30|$|In summary, {{hierarchical}} <b>Cd</b> 4 <b>SiS</b> 6 /SiO 2 heterostructure nanowires arrays {{have been}} prepared on silicon substrates via simple thermal evaporation with CdS powder. Studies indicate that the hierarchical <b>Cd</b> 4 <b>SiS</b> 6 /SiO 2 nanowires heterostructure arrays consist of a single crystalline <b>Cd</b> 4 <b>SiS</b> 6 core coated amorphous SiO 2 and adjacent amorphous SiO 2 nanowires.

The properties of hierarchical <b>Cd</b> 4 <b>SiS</b> 6 /SiO 2 heterostructure nanowires were characterized by RS and PL. The Raman peaks can be assigned to the modes of Cd–S and Si–S.

HET teams were first heavily implemented by the U.S Marines, then the U.S Army in Iraq and Afghanistan. These teams were highly successful because of their capability to be a tactical collection asset as well as a tactical assault team. This gave commanders the ability to not only use the teams for intelligence collection but also for tactical objectives.

On June 5 he began to display listless behavior, first appearing unstable on his feet then lying down and soiling himself, becoming covered in excrement. As other prisoners had been known to exhibit false signs of faking physical distress, it was unclear if Hatab's behavior was legitimate, and his failure to communicate with the Marine translator compounded the situation. Paulus ordered one of his Marines to haul Hatab out of the common cell to where he could be hosed off. He ordered his soiled clothes removed and burned, and for him to be placed in an outside wire enclosure so his loss of bowel control wouldn't soil the other prisoners' living and eating areas.|$|R
