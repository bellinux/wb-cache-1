5|$|In {{addition}} to the Baptist faith, Methodists started coming to the Cacapon River Valley during {{the latter half of}} the 18th century. Methodist Episcopal Church circuit rider Francis Asbury traveled through the <b>Capon</b> Bridge area in 1781. In 1890, the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church established its presence in the <b>Capon</b> Bridge area under the leadership of G. O. Homan. According to Maxwell and Swisher, the <b>Capon</b> Bridge Methodist circuit consisted of the following places in 1897: <b>Capon</b> Bridge, North River Mills, Green Mound, Augusta, Sedan, Park's Hollow, Sandy Ridge, and <b>Capon</b> Chapel. <b>Capon</b> Chapel was not commonly used as a Baptist place of worship by the early 20th century, and developed into a permanent stop along the <b>Capon</b> Bridge Methodist circuit, which later grew to include Central Church at Loom and Bethel Church at Neals Run. In 1976, the circuit's pastor was Thomas Malcolm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Growth {{performance}} and carcass characteristics of <b>capons</b> (castrated cockerels) from three breeds/strains locally presented in Slovenia and Austria were investigated. Growth and feed consumption {{data were collected}} for a 156 -d and 199 -d period, when randomly chosen animals were slaughtered and their carcasses dissected. The feed conversion rate in barred Prelux, Sulmtaler and Styrian <b>capons</b> for the whole growing period was 6. 24 kg, 6. 32 kg and 7. 53 kg, respectively. Average body weight in barred Prelux and Styrian <b>capons</b> increased only in the first 156 days of age, but not further on. Cumulative mortality rate in Sulmtaler <b>capons</b> was 19. 05 % and was 2. 7 to 4. 4 -fold higher as compared with Styrian and barred Prelux <b>capons</b> (6. 90 % and 4. 31 % respectively). Sulmtaler <b>capons</b> had the lowest abdominal fat content. Barred Prelux <b>capons,</b> as compared to <b>capons</b> from other two breeds were characterized by higher pre-slaughter weight, higher carcass weight and higher dressing out percentages. This indicates that the layer type barred Prelux cockerels have a potential to be as <b>capons</b> put to profitable use...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{castration}} on {{the growth}} of muscles in different body parts were investigated in this study in cocks. Cocks and <b>capons</b> of New Hampshire (NH), Barred Plymouth Rock (BPR) and <b>capons</b> of BPR treated with testosterone propionate (TP) from 26 to 31 weeks of age were used. Body weights, muscle weights in different body parts and individual muscle weights were compared among the experimental groups at 20, 30 and 31 weeks of age. The results obtained were as follows: 1) There was little difference in body weitht between cocks and <b>capons</b> in NH and BPR breeds during experimental periods However, body weight gain in TP treated <b>capons</b> was significantly larger than those in cocks and <b>capons</b> {{during the period of}} TP administration. 2) Growth retardation of muscles was observed in cervical, dorso-caudal, pelvic, femoral and crural parts after castration. Muscle weights of these parts in <b>capons</b> were significantly smaller than those of the corresponding parts in cocks at 30 - 31 weeks of age. The most obvious retardation of muscle growth was seen in femoral part in <b>capons.</b> As the result of TP administration to <b>capons,</b> muscle weights of these parts were recovered from the weights in <b>capons</b> to those in cocks. 3) Castration had also a remarkable effect {{on the growth}} of the individual muscles such as M. sartorius, M. biceps femoris, M. semitendinosus, M. semimembranosus and M. quadriceps femoris. Weights of these muscles in <b>capons</b> were significantly smaller than those in cocks at 30 - 31 weeks of age. The most conspicuous retardation was seen in M. sartorius in <b>capons.</b> As the result of TP administration to <b>capons,</b> these individual muscle weithts were recovered from the weights in <b>capons</b> to those in cocks. In conclusion, castration had a remarkable effect on the growth of muscle, with the conspicuous depression of the growth of hindleg muscle in particular. It seems that this was due to the retardation of special muscle growth {{as the result of the}} lack of androgen secretion from testis. 本実験では雄鶏の去勢が体格部位骨格筋および個々の骨格筋の発育に及ぼす影響について研究した．供試鶏としては New Hampshire (NH) 種と Barred Piymouth Rock (BPR) 種の雄鶏と去勢鶏，それにBPRの去勢鶏に testosterone propionate (TP) を 26 週齢時から 31 週齢時まで投与したTP処理鶏を用いた．それぞれ計量した生体重，体格部位骨格筋および個々の骨格筋について，雄鶏と去勢鶏間では 20 ， 30 ， 31 週齢時に，去勢鶏とTP処理期間では 31 週齢時に比較検討を行った．その大要は次のとおりであった． 1 ）去勢鶏の生体重の変動は両品種とも雄鶏と同じであった．しかし，BPRのTP処理鶏でのTP投与期間中の増体量は雄鶏や去勢鶏より有意に大きかった． 2 ）去勢は体格部位骨格筋の発育に著しい影響を及ぼした．すなわち， 30 - 31 週齢時における去勢鶏の頸部，背および尾部，寛部，大腿部および下腿部骨格筋重量は両品種とも雄鶏より有意に小さく，特に大腿部で顕著であった．BPR去勢鶏へのTPの投与は去勢により発育の劣った骨格筋部位の発育の回復を引き起こした． 3 ）去勢は個々の骨格筋の発育にも著しい影響を及ぼした．すなわち， 30 - 31 週齢時における去勢鶏の個々の骨格筋重量は後肢を構成する縫工筋，大腿二頭筋，半腱様筋，半膜様筋および大腿四頭筋等で雄鶏より有意に小さく，特に縫工筋で顕著であった．BPRの去勢鶏にTPを投与すると去勢によって発育の劣った個々の骨格筋の発育の回復がみられた．以上のことから，雄鶏の去勢は特に後肢骨格筋の著しい重量低下をもたらしたが，それは精巣Androgenの欠如による特定骨格筋の発育の遅延に起因するものと思われる...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} caponisation on live weight, weight gain, carcass {{characteristics}} and blood plasma values of pheasants were examined. Eighty pheasants reared in feathered game nurserie {{were included in}} experiment. The birds were castrated at 8 or 12 weeks of age. The age of castration up to 12 weeks showed complete testicular regeneration while when castration was performed at 8 weeks of age testicular regeneration reached 25 %. Pheasant <b>capons,</b> that were fed higher protein diet, showed lower live weights but higher dressing percentages than game pheasants. Weight and weight gain of pheasant <b>capons</b> were increased till December. Blood plasma values showed significantly higher levels (P< 0. 01) of Ca, total protein and albumin for pheasant <b>capons</b> but these differences were related to composition of feed mixtures. We concluded that pheasant <b>capons</b> fed higher protein diet represents better commercial product than pheasant reared as game animals but that more studies under different feeding conditions and alternative breeding systems are necessary to clarify the effects of caponisation of pheasants and to justify production.

40|$|Abstract: Large comb (LC) broiler cockerels, {{with high}} levels of {{testosterone}} and corticosterone, survived acute heat stress while small comb (SC) cockerels, with low levels of testosterone and corticosterone were more susceptible to heat stress and suffered higher mortality rates. This phenomenon was related to the greater ability of the LC and the lesser ability of the SC broilers to synthesize heat shock proteins (HSP), which are involved in acquisition and maintenance of thermotolerance. When broiler cockerels, selected for LC or SC, were exposed to acute heat stress, the synthesis of three HSP-hsp- 90, hsp- 70 and hsp- 23 by peripheral blood leukocytes was elevated in both groups of broilers, but LC chickens responded with higher HSP synthesis than did SC chickens. One of the normal cellular proteins, actin, was depressed during the heat stress over 105 minutes. To determine whether steroid hormones, testosterone and corticosterone, influence the expression of HSP in chickens, exogenous testosterone and corticosterone were implanted in LC <b>capons</b> and metyrapone-fed LC <b>capons,</b> respectively. The plasma testosterone was raised in the testosterone-treated <b>capons,</b> was depressed in the <b>capons</b> and metyrapone-fed <b>capons</b> and was indicated indirectly by growth rate of the comb. The heat-induced synthesis of HSP was depressed by caponization and depressed further in the <b>capons</b> fed metyrapone, which blocks the synthesis pathway of endogenous corticosterone in adrenal glands. The exogenous testosterone and to a lesser degree, corticosterone, stimulated the expression of HSP in heat-stressed <b>capons.</b> The results suggested that the steroid hormones, testosterone and corticosterone, are involved in the expression of HSP, which are associated with acquired and maintained thermoresistance in domestic chickens...|$|R

5|$|The {{technological}} design advances made by Whipple and Murphy, {{in addition}} to further advances in steel and iron fabrication, made wrought iron truss bridges a major industry in the United States. The <b>Capon</b> Lake bridge was a Whipple–Murphy truss bridge, since it incorporated Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords. At {{the time of the}} bridge's original fabrication in 1874, metal truss bridges were ordered from catalogs by county courts and other entities responsible for transportation construction and maintenance. These entities provided the desired width, length, and other specifications, and the truss materials were shipped to the construction site and assembled by local construction teams. Metal truss bridges were more economically feasible, could span longer distances, and were simpler to construct than stone bridges, and they were more durable than wooden bridges. They were also marketed as detachable and transportable structures that could be dismantled and reassembled. The technology used in the <b>Capon</b> Lake Whipple Truss Bridge revolutionized transport throughout West Virginia. While the Whipple truss bridge had waned in popularity by the 1890s, the bridges were commonly disassembled and re-erected for use on secondary roads, {{as was the case with}} the <b>Capon</b> Lake Whipple Truss Bridge in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The Baptists {{established}} the oldest extant churches in Hampshire County. After {{the end of}} the American Revolutionary War, Baptist preachers continued their attempt to gain a foothold in what is now the Eastern Panhandle region. During the Baptists' early growth in Hampshire County, the best known Baptist ministers were John Monroe (1750–1824) and Benjamin Stone (1743–1842). Monroe preached at the North River, Crooked Run, and Patterson's Creek churches during the early 19th century. According to historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher in History of Hampshire County, West Virginia (1897), Monroe was a minister for Primitive Baptists, who were adherent to a strict interpretation of the Calvinist theology of the Ketocton Association. Monroe probably established a Baptist church {{on the site of the}} present-day <b>Capon</b> Chapel, where he is buried in the church's cemetery. However, other sources claim that a Baptist congregation began gathering at the <b>Capon</b> Chapel site as early as 1756.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare carcass and meat quality traits of ecologically reared <b>capons</b> and cocks.
