50|$|What are “chills” and “freezes” and {{why does}} DTC impose them? Occasionally a problem may arise with a company or its {{securities}} on deposit at DTC. In some of those cases DTC may impose a “chill” or a “freeze” on all the company’s securities. A “chill” is a restriction placed by DTC on {{one or more of}} DTC’s services, such as limiting a DTC participant’s ability to make a deposit or withdrawal of the security at DTC. A chill may remain imposed on a security for just a few days or {{for an extended period of}} time depending upon the reasons for the chill and whether the issuer or transfer agent corrects the problem. A “freeze” is a discontinuation of all services at DTC. Freezes may last a few days or an extended period of time, depending on the reason for the freeze. If the reasons for the freeze cannot be rectified, then the security will generally be removed from DTC, and securities transactions in that security will no longer be eligible to be cleared at any registered <b>clearing</b> <b>agency.</b> Chills and freezes are monitored by DTC's Office of Regulatory Compliance.|$|E

The paper begins with an overview of public sector statistics regarding capital investment financing. One of the most difficult tasks was to adapt the idiosyncratic reporting method of Croatian public sector statistics to more usual public expenditure conventions. After an attempt at statistical systematization in line with conventional procedures, and analysis of the results obtained, the paper tries to point to the problems that arise during the preparation and execution of the budget. These problems are connected with existing participants in the budget process: local governments, public enterprises, extra-budgetary funds, government agencies, the payments <b>clearing</b> <b>agency,</b> the government auditing agency, and the (non) existent government treasury. The paper offers some suggestions for improvements in the capital investment financing process. These relate to the improvement of public sector statistics; the establishment of the government treasury; the reevaluation of the roles of the payments <b>clearing</b> <b>agency,</b> the other government agencies and the public enterprises; problems of local government financing, of the allocation of funds through the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development, of development vs. reconstruction financing, of government auditing, of government guarantees, and of the necessity of foreign sources of financing.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} general {{guidelines and}} recommendations for introducing or refining an independent regulatory commission (IRC). The principles identified here can help policymakers decide on the basic design {{and structure of the}} IRC, its jurisdiction (whether single- or multi-sector) and its key regulatory functions.

Indeed, if any of these conditions is lacking, the IRC will be unable to function in a way that promotes strong sector performance. Focusing on the electric power sector, we recognize that the process of reform is still evolving and that an agency's structure must permit it to adapt effectively to changing technological and market conditions. Our recommendations reflect international experience and best practice developments in the past two decades...|$|R

Regulatory norms, which prescribe appropriate behavior {{for state and}} non-state actors, exist {{in a variety of}} issue-areas.

40|$|We offer a {{provocation}} – that {{we should}} stop appending ‘Critical’ to ‘Security Studies’. Critical security as an academically and politically contested terrain is no longer productive of emancipatory alternatives. In making this claim, we seek to reflect upon the underlying dynamics which drove the boom in critical security studies in the 1990 s and the early 2000 s and its pale afterlife in the recent years. To support the argument empirically, the {{attention is paid to}} the role of emancipatory agency at the heart of critical security understandings. As we argue, the current state of ‘critical’ security theorising is no longer informed by the emancipatory impulse of the 1990 s and the critical claims have been much damaged by the retreat of liberal internationalism and rise of non-emancipatory and post-emancipatory approaches. The critics that remain in the field thus articulate much lower horizons with regard to policy alternatives and conceptualise no <b>clear</b> <b>agency</b> of emancipatory possibilities. Ironically, ‘critical’ security theorists today are more likely to argue against transformative aspirations – rather than in favour of them...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, many {{attempts}} have been made to computerize the management of patient records using advanced computing and networking facilities across healthcare providers such as hospitals, clinics, and <b>clearing</b> <b>agencies.</b> In addition to this transition from disparate and paper-based infrastructure to consolidated and digital medium-based one, we have been confronted with privacy and security requirements since the advent of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA). The problem we seek to address in this paper is to provide authentication of individual identity in the context of accessing critical information in web-based e-Health systems including secure transmission of data across the Internet. These problems have technical solutions that are well known, but the solutions in general are strongly biased toward a single individual interacting with a single application. In this paper, we propose a scalable token-based authentication architecture and demonstrate how we can implement this architecture using commercial-off-the-self technologies. Our approach focuses on vendor-neutral specifications. The proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented so that the pilot testing may be conducted at various sites...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} aims to {{question}} the assumptions underlying the economic case for the independent European Central Bank (ECB) and argues that although a European <b>Clearing</b> <b>Agency</b> (ECA) of the type Keynes envisaged for the international economy is not a panacea for the economic problems of the European Union (EU), it is, nonetheless, a better way forward and far superior to the ECB. The paper (1) outlines the theoretical basis of Keynesian monetary and financial theory; (2) aims to ascertain {{the extent to which}} credit availability is affected by the creation of an ECB and, on that basis, to offer a critical analysis of current proposals for an ECB; (3) looks closely at the case for the ECA, seen as performing a range of functions rather than having a remit defined simply in terms of strict monetary control, including a commitment to providing the necessary finance for full employment and a responsibility for ensuring that the burden of balance-of-payments adjustment falls upon both deficit and surplus countries. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{financial}} crisis {{from the point of}} view of global intermediation, arguing that it is in crisis. Its main fault lines were exposed as early as the Asian crisis and the dotcom debacle. The global economy only recovered from those in a dysfunctional way: by creating a credit boom in the US after the 2001 - 2 recession. In the aftermath of the financial crisis the threat of global financial disintermediation has now reemerged, and the challenge for policy intervention today is to revive global intermediation on a sound footing. This in turn requires a new international monetary system that can address the problems embedded in the current system. This paper discusses current arguments for and against reviving a multicurrency system and old and new proposals for an enhanced role for special drawing rights (SDRs). In addition, it offers two new proposals: one for international development funds whose liabilities would carry a multilateral guarantee and could be used as reserve assets for both new and existing holdings of currency reserves, and another that would create an international <b>clearing</b> <b>agency</b> (ICA) to process payments in all member countries ’ currencies by debiting and crediting reserv...|$|E

40|$|In Malaysia, {{the use of}} French {{language}} is virtually nonexistent. Furthermore, students who major in French frequently do not choose this program voluntarily; often it is chosen for them by a national <b>clearing</b> <b>agency.</b> In this context, how can we boost learners’ participation and motivation in a course they have not selected? In a blended approach of e-learning, and m-learning, {{students were asked to}} use both the internet and their mobile phones to produce multimedia documents. These resources were then shared and evaluated on an e-learning platform. Evaluations were both self- and peer conducted. During and after this project, quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Our findings reveal that participation and motivation were mutually increased. This was achieved by implicating the students in the learning process, from the conception to the distribution and finally evaluation of resources. As a result, communication skills were boosted and an online community was forged. Could these results have been obtained without the use of technology? It is probable that an activity where messages were pinned on a board could also have enhanced the learning process. However, it seems unlikely that learners would have attained such a rich level of communication without employing ICTs. Mobile phones are important in the learners’ culture and including this technology proved more effective than expected...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} game-theoretic study of hybrid {{communication}} networks in which mobile devices can connect to a base station, The maximal number of allowed hops might be bounded {{in order to}} guarantee small latency. We introduce hybrid connectivity games to study the impact of selfishness {{on this kind of}} infrastructure. Mobile devices are represented by selfish players, each of which aims at establishing an uplink path to the base station minimizing its individual cost. Our model assumes that intermediate nodes on an uplink path are reimbursed for transmitting the packets of other devices. Depending on the model, the reimbursements can be paid either by a benevolent network operator or by the senders of the packets using micropayments via a <b>clearing</b> <b>agency</b> that possibly collects a small percentage as commission. Our main findings are these: If there is no constraint on the number of allowed hops on the path to the base station, then the existence of equilibria is guaranteed regardless of whether the network operator or the senders pay for forwarding packets. If there is an upper bound on the number of allowed hops on the uplink path, then the existence of equilibria depends on who pays for forwarding packets. If the network operator pays, then the existence of equilibria is guaranteed only if at most one intermediate node is allowed. If the senders pay for forwarding their packets, then equilibria are guaranteed to exist given any upper bound on the number of allowed hops. Our equilibrium analysis gives a first game-theoretic motivation for the implementation of micropayment schemes in which senders pay for forwarding their packets. We further support this evidence by giving an upper bound on the "price of anarchy" for this kind of hybrid connectivity game that is independent of the number of nodes but depends only on the number of hops and the power gradient...|$|E
