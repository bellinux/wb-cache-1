50|$|In NDP, {{a thermal}} or <b>cold</b> <b>neutron</b> beam {{passes through a}} {{material}} and interacts with isotopes that emit monoenergetic charged particles upon neutron absorption; either a proton or an alpha, and a recoil nucleus.

Because low-energy neutrons are used, {{there is no significant}} momentum transfer from the neutron beam to the substrate, and the analysis is practically non-destructive. As charged particles move towards the surface, they are rapidly slowed down, primarily by interacting with the electrons of the substrate. The amount of energy loss {{is directly related to the}} thickness penetrated by the particle. The depth of the reaction site can be found by stopping power correlations.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{production}} of ultracold neutrons (UCNs) in superfluid helium. The principal idea consists in installing a helium UCN source into an external beam of thermal or <b>cold</b> <b>neutrons</b> and in surrounding this source {{with a solid}} methane moderator/reflector cooled down to ~ 4 [*]K. The moderator {{plays the role of}} an external source of <b>cold</b> <b>neutrons</b> needed to produce UCNs. The flux of accumulated neutrons could exceed the flux of incident neutrons due to their numerous reflections from methane; also the source size could be significantly larger than the incident beam diameter. We provide preliminary calculations of cooling of neutrons. These calculations show that such a source being installed at an intense source of thermal or <b>cold</b> <b>neutrons</b> like the ILL or PIK reactor or the ESS spallation source could provide the UCN density 105 [*]cm− 3, the production rate 107 [*]UCN/s− 1. Main advantages of such an UCN source include its low radiative and thermal load, relatively low cost, and convenient accessibility for any maintenance.

50|$|After {{neutrons}} are produced, {{they need}} to be slowed down (decrease in kinetic energy), to the speed desired for imaging. This can take the form of some length of water, polyethylene, or graphite at room temperature to produce thermal neutrons. In the moderator the neutrons will collide with the nucleus of atoms and so slow down. Eventually the speed of these neutrons will achieve some distribution based on the temperature (amount of kinetic energy) of the moderator. If higher energy neutrons are desired, a graphite moderator can be heated to produce neutrons of higher energy (termed epithermal neutrons). For lower energy neutrons, a cold moderator such as liquid deuterium (an isotope of Hydrogen), can be used to produce low energy neutrons (<b>cold</b> <b>neutron).</b> If no or less moderator is present, high energy neutrons (termed fast neutrons), can be produced. The higher the temperature of the moderator, the higher the resulting kinetic energy of the neutrons is and the faster the neutrons will travel. Generally, faster neutrons will be more penetrating, but some interesting deviations from this trend exist and can sometimes be utilized in neutron imaging. Generally an imaging system is designed and set up to produce only a single energy of neutrons, with most imaging systems producing thermal or cold neutrons.|$|E
