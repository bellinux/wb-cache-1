5|$|In {{spite of}} these facts, the myth lived on: in his Histoire de la révolution française, Adolphe Thiers wrote an account repeating Barère's version, where Vengeur refused to surrender. In 1847 Alphonse de Lamartine even invented the story that Renaudin had been killed heroically, <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> by a cannon shot like Dupetit-Thouars.|$|E
5|$|Aborigines were {{represented}} by eight members out of 225 {{seats in the}} Legislative Yuan. In 2008, the number of legislative seats was <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> to 113, of which Taiwanese aborigines are represented by six members, three each for lowland and highland peoples. The tendency of Taiwanese aborigines to vote {{for members of the}} pan-blue coalition has been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature. Citing these six seats in addition with five seats from smaller counties that also tend to vote pan-blue has been seen as giving the pan-blue coalition 11 seats before the first vote is counted.|$|E
5|$|By 23BC, {{some of the}} un-Republican {{implications}} {{were becoming}} apparent concerning the settlement of 27BC. Augustus' retention of an annual consulate drew attention to his de facto dominance over the Roman political system, and <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> the opportunities for others to achieve what was still nominally the preeminent position in the Roman state. Further, he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the Principate in his turn, alienating his three greatest supporters– Agrippa, Maecenas, and Livia. Feeling pressure from his core group of adherents, Augustus turned to the Senate for help.|$|E

5|$|During Team Canada's stay in Moscow, the team's {{treatment}} {{was the source}} of numerous complaints by the players. When leaving Sweden, the team was informed that the players would stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players and wives together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and the players would smuggle some of their food to their wives. The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half.</b> At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1940, Fraser, {{her sister}} , and the cruiser Calcutta were {{returning}} from St. Jean de Luz after rescuing refugees {{trapped by the}} German Army (Operation Ariel), when Fraser was rammed by Calcutta in the Gironde estuary. Struck forward of the bridge by the cruiser's bow, Fraser was <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> and sank immediately. All but 45 of the ship's crew were rescued by Restigouche and other nearby ships.

5|$|The Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez circuit {{underwent}} substantial reconfiguration in the build-up to the event. The first corner complex was tightened on entry, {{while the}} middle {{part of the}} track was completely re-profiled, retaining much of the original design whilst reducing the reliance on aerodynamic grip. The most significant changes {{were made in the}} final part, with the Peraltada corner <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> and the circuit redirected through the Foro Sol stadium complex in the circuit infield beginning with turn 12, following a similar layout to the one used by Champ Car between 2002 and 2007. The track layout featured two drag reduction system (DRS) zones, one on the main straight and another between turns three and four.|$|E

By mid-August the encirclement succeeded and both towns were taken but many Soviet formations were able to evacuate by sea. Further west, {{the attack on}} Viborg was launched. With Soviet resistance breaking down, the Finns were able to encircle Vyborg by advancing to the Vuoksi River. The city itself was taken on 30 August, along with a broad advance {{on the rest of the}} Karelian Isthmus. By the beginning of September, Finland had restored its pre-winter war borders.|$|E

In April 2017, the series' third season, entitled Combiner Force, began airing and focuses on Bee Team's realization that they can combine into the Combiner, Ultra Bee, as well as the arrival of the Stunticons, who are also capable of combining. Soundwave also plans to return with the help of Activators, a new breed of Minicons.|$|E
5|$|Development since 1850 {{has greatly}} altered the {{places in the}} {{watershed}} where plants and animals can thrive. In a report published in 2005, the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES), using data from an early General Land Office survey, compared the watershed of 1851 with that of 2003. The study showed {{that all of the}} watershed provided plant and wildlife habitat in 1851, but by 2003 only 33percent provided habitat. In 1851, water covered 10percent of the watershed but that had been <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> by 2003. Marshes and other wetlands that had comprised 22percent of the earlier watershed dwindled to 1percent by 2003, while the percentage of land devoted to industry, commerce, and homes rose from 0 to 34. In addition, habitat remaining in 2003 was greatly disturbed, dominated by Himalayan blackberry and other invasive species and fragmented by roads. The riparian zone along the slough was generally narrow or nonexistent and devoid of trees and shrubs in places, including along the levees.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} was re-raised in 1921 as {{part the}} re-organisation of the Australian military {{that took place}} at that time, with the battalion becoming a part-time unit of the Citizen Forces, assigned to the 4th Brigade, 3rd Division. Upon formation, the battalion drew its personnel from four previously existing Citizen Forces units: the 2nd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment; the 5th Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment; 5th Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment {{and part of the}} 29th Light Horse, and perpetuated the battle honours and traditions of its associated AIF battalion. Based in Melbourne, the battalion was brought up to its authorised strength of around 1,000 men through the compulsory training scheme. The following year, however, the Army's budget was <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> and the scope of the scheme reduced following the resolution of the Washington Naval Treaty which arguably improved Australia's strategic outlook. As a result of this, the battalion's authorised strength was reduced to just 409 men of all ranks and training and recruitment were scaled back significantly.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} silk {{was found at}} the sites of Yangshao culture in Xia County, Shanxi, where a silk cocoon was found <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> by a sharp knife, dating back to between 4000 and 3000 BCE. The species was identified as Bombyx mori, the domesticated silkworm. Fragments of primitive loom {{can also be seen}} from the sites of Hemudu culture in Yuyao, Zhejiang, dated to about 4000 BCE. The earliest example of silk fabric is from 3630 BC, and was used as wrapping for the body of a child. The fabric comes from a Yangshao site in Qingtaicun at Rongyang, Henan. Scraps of silk were found in a Liangzhu culture site at Qianshanyang in Huzhou, Zhejiang, dating back to 2700 BCE. Other fragments have been recovered from royal tombs in the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 – c. 1046 BCE).|$|E

Fearing the attack of the French fireships or the boarding of Brézé's galleys, Contreras covered the damaged galleon at the head of six vessels, while Linhares flag galley towed it out of danger. The remaining ships engaged Brézé in an inconclusive action which lasted until both fleets separated at dusk. The Spanish lost the frigate Santa Catalina, burnt by its own crew to avoid capture when she was surrounded by the French la Mazarine and three other vessels. The foremost Spanish galleons Testa de Oro, León Rojo and Caballo marino received heavy damage, while a French fireship blew up. Two French galleons were also badly damaged. The human loss aboard the Spanish fleet is unknown. Forty men were killed or wounded aboard the French fleet One of them was Admiral Brézé, <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> by a cannonball which hit the stern of his flagship Grand Saint Louis.|$|E

5|$|On June 30, 2004, then-Mayor Newsom {{pledged to}} fix San Francisco’s {{homeless}} problem within 10 years and clear downtown streets of its widespread homeless population. He stated {{that people who}} were homeless and seriously ill would be given shelter. After 10 years and $1.5 billion, the city relocated 19,500 people off the streets, with 11,363 single adults being housed, and 8,086 people {{being sent to the}} home of a willing family member or friend though the Homeward Bound program. Before the program in 2002, there was a 8,640 generally homeless and 4,535 street homeless population in San Francisco. After the program was initiated, the homeless population dropped 28% by 2005, with a generally homeless population of 6,248 and a 2,655 street homeless population. However, after 2005, the homeless population has stayed approximately the same. In fact, the San Francisco population of homeless rose 3 percent between 2005 and 2013. The percentage of the homeless population in jail was <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> between 2005 and 2013, which is an indicator that some of the homeless population who would have ended up in jail were now being housed and treated.|$|E
