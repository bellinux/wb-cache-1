40|$|Stoichiometric {{modeling}} {{of the early}} stages of the <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> process by Aspergillus niger revealed that ammonium ions combine with a carbon-containing metabolite inside the cell, in a ratio 1 : 1, to form a nitrogen compound which is then excreted by the mycelium. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis identified glucosamine as the product of the relationship between glucose and ammonium during {{the early stages of}} the <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> process. Slightly acidic internal pHs, extremely low ammonium ion concentrations inside the cell, and glucosamine synthesis come into direct contradiction with the earlier theory of the ammonium pool inside the cell, regarded as responsible for inhibition of the enzyme phosphofructokinase. At later fermentation stages, when the mycelium is involved in a process of fragmentation and regrowth, the addition of ammonium sulfate leads to a series of events: the formation and secretion of glucosamine in elevated amounts, the short inhibition of citrate synthesis, growth enhancement, the utilization of glucosamine, and finally, the enhancement of citric acid production rates. Obviously, the enzymatic processes underlining the phenomena need to be reexamined. As a by-product of the <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation,</b> glucosamine is reported for the first time here. Suitable process manipulations of the system described in this work could lead to successful glucosamine recovery at the point of its highest yield before degradation by the fungus occurs...|$|E

40|$|The central {{aspect of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the influence of nitrogen feed rate at constant C/N ratio on continuous <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> by Candida oleophila ATCC 20177. Medium ammonia nitrogen and glucose concentrations influenced growth and production. Space-time yield (STY) meaning volumetric productivity, biomass specific productivity (BSP), product concentration, product selectivity and citrate/isocitrate ratio increased with increasing residence time (RT). BSP increased in an exponential mode lowering nitrogen feed rates. Highest BSP for citric acid of 0. 13 g/(g h) was achieved at lowest NH 4 Cl concentration of 1. 5 g/l and highest STY (1. 2 g/l h) with 3 g NH 4 Cl/l at a RT of 25 h. Citric acid 74. 2 g/l were produced at 58 h RT and 6 g NH 4 Cl/l. Glucose uptake rate seems to be strictly controlled by the growth rate of the yeast cells.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to obtain {{detailed}} information on the production of <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> during submerged <b>fermentation</b> by Aspergillus niger, {{in an attempt to}} understand and optimize the process. Initial experiments were performed to determine the effect of interruptions to aeration on <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> production. Unless the value of the Dissolved Oxygen Tension (DOT) of the culture fell below the DOT crit. (20 % of saturation), no gross effect was observed. When the DOT value fell to zero, <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> production ceased. Production however, recovered after recommencement of aeration, albeit after a delay. Experiments were performed in batch fermentation using various non-carbohydrate medium components as the growth-limiting nutrient. Nitrogen-, phosphate- or sulphate-limited cultures resulted in strong <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> production. The most significant observation during these fermentations was that the maximum <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> production rate occurred prior to the exhaustion of the limiting nutrient, i. e. when the organism was at a positive growth rate. Chemostat experiments were performed {{in order to determine the}} effect of the growth rate and the culture DOT on <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> production. Maximum <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> production rates and yields were achieved at low growth rate (u = 0. 017 h- 1) and high DOT (90 % of saturation) values.

40|$|The early {{production}} of gas in cheese, called 'blowing' was caused chiefly by some coli-aerogenes bacteria of the aerogenes-cloacae type and intermediate types. These bacteria produced gas in a combined fermentation-curdling test both on milk and on cheese; {{they were called}} blowing-positive strains. A second group of coli-aerogenes bacteria, although forming acid and gas from lactose in a synthetic lactose medium, did not produce gas in the combined fermentation-curdling test. This was apparently due {{to the presence of}} <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> in the combined test since this acid prevented blowing-negative coliaerogenes strains producing gas from lactose; the <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> was reduced to succinic acid. As a result these blowing-negative types decomposed the sugar present in the medium without forming gas. Excess of <b>citric</b> <b>acid,</b> however, may be fermented with {{production of}} gas. <b>Citric</b> <b>acid</b> always increased gas production by blowing-positive strains through its fermentation. Blowing caused by blowing-positive strains decreased when negative strains were also present. It was found that KN 0 3, KNO 2, and KClO 3, prevented gas production from lactose by blowing-positive strains. These compounds seemed to be reduced, thus inhibiting gas production from lactose, while intermediate products occurred which prevented the development of the coli-aerogenes bacteria. KClO 3 appeared to be the most efficient inhibitor. Under practical conditions addition of 1 g per 100 litres milk may be sufficient. Lactic <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> was not influenced by adding this amount of KClO 3. <p/...|$|R
40|$|During aerobic fermentations, {{availability}} of oxygen to microorganisms {{is a very}} important factor for their growth and subsequent product formation. To evaluate the amount of oxygen that is available to microorganisms for their consumption, the oxygen mass transfer coefficient (KLa) is often used in the design and comparison of bioreactors. It becomes more difficult to characterize oxygen mass transfer and to design bioreactors when the viscosity of the medium constantly increases during the fermentation process. Therefore, this work is concerned with the study of K La in viscous fermentation systems. Two types of bioreactors, the reciprocating plate bioreactor and the stirred tank bioreactor, were used to study the growth of Aspergillus niger and the production of <b>citric</b> <b>acid.</b> This <b>fermentation</b> leads to a very viscous fermentation medium due to the long filamentous structure of Aspergillus niger. Before conducting fermentation experiments with the microorganism Aspergillus niger, wood pulp solutions were used as a model fluid to mimic its physical characteristics and to study the oxygen mass transfer in such mixtures. Experiments were done with different pulp concentrations and KLa was estimated using the gassing-out method. The estimated KLa values were then correlated to the power input per unit volume and the gas superficial velocity using a power law equation. Fermentation experiments with Aspergillus niger were conducted with both bioreactors at different agitation speeds, and KLa was estimated using a data reconciliation algorithm that used 12 measured process variables and 4 mass conservation models. KLa was obtained at different stages of fermentation and at different agitation intensities. It is believed that the data reconciliation algorithm allowed reliable estimates of KLa...|$|R
30|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of molding composed of wood powder and <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> were investigated. The molding had good bending properties and impact strength. In particular, the molding with 20.0  wt% <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> content showed excellent values. The water resistance increased with increasing <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> content, and good resistance against boiling water was also recognized. However, marked elution caused by substances derived from <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> was observed in samples with high <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> content. The thermal properties of the molding decreased with increasing <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> content. However, a significant difference of the thermal properties was scarcely observed in the moldings after a repeated boiling treatment, irrespective of <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> content. Based on the results of FT-IR, it was clarified that the bonding mechanism of the molding was ester linkages between wood and <b>citric</b> <b>acid.</b> We therefore concluded that <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> can be used as an adhesive for wood-based molding.|$|R
