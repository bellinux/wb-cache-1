5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The Flight Data Recorder was recovered intact from the wreckage, but the <b>Cockpit</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>Recorder</b> had been damaged in the post-crash fire and was unusable.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{the pilot}} in command, {{according}} to the <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder</b> transcript, the first officer was the pilot flying {{at the time of}} the accident. In the National Transportation Safety Board report on the crash, investigators concluded that the likely cause of the crash was pilot error.|$|E
5|$|Following the crash, the aircraft's <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder</b> was {{recovered}} from the wreckage and the data recorded found to be intact and usable. Under Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 Air Taxi rules, no flight data recorder was required {{for this type of}} flight and one had not been installed.|$|E

5|$|In October 1992, Hans Ephraimson-Abt led a {{delegation}} of families and U.S. State Department officials to Moscow {{at the invitation of}} President Yeltsin. During a state ceremony at St. Catherine's Hall in the Kremlin, the KAL family delegation was handed a portfolio containing partial transcripts of the KAL007 <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder,</b> translated into Russian, and documents of the Politburo pertaining to the tragedy.|$|E
5|$|The DC-9 {{carried a}} {{primitive}} {{flight data recorder}} that recorded basic information about the aircraft's air speed, acceleration, heading, and altitude on metal foil tapes. Additionally, the aircraft was equipped with a simple <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder</b> that recorded all conversations {{that took place in}} the cockpit of the aircraft. The flight recorder was recovered by investigators on Thursday, June 10, 1971, and sent to Washington D.C. for analysis. Though the voice recorder was also recovered, the thermal protective measures had failed and the recording tapes were destroyed by fire.|$|E
5|$|The ICAO investigation, led by Caj Frostell, did {{not have}} the {{authority}} to compel the states involved to hand over evidence, instead having to rely on what they voluntarily submitted. Consequently, the investigation {{did not have}} access to sensitive evidence such as radar data, intercepts, ATC tapes, or the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and <b>Cockpit</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>Recorder</b> (CVR) (whose discovery the U.S.S.R. had kept secret). A number of simulations were conducted with the assistance of Boeing and Litton (the manufacturer of the navigation system).|$|E
5000|$|The Soviet {{authorities}} returned about 50% of the wreckage. Some {{major components}} were not returned, including the flight data and <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorders,</b> flight control systems, navigation and communication equipment.|$|R
5000|$|... {{a country}} without the {{technical}} ability {{to conduct a}} full investigation asks for the TSB's assistance (especially {{in the field of}} reading and analyzing the content of flight data <b>recorders</b> and <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorders).</b>|$|R
25|$|Both {{the flight}} data and <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> were {{recovered}} from the wreckage. Based on the pattern of wreckage, investigators concluded that the aircraft had broken up on impact and not while in the air.|$|R
5|$|The {{flight data}} {{recorder}} stopped recording at 22:25:40 AT (01:25:40 UTC), followed one second later by the <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder.</b> The aircraft briefly appeared again on radar screens from 22:25:50 AT (01:25:50 UTC) to 22:26:04 AT (01:26:04 UTC). The last altitude recorded was 9,700 feet. According to the <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder,</b> shortly after the first emergency declaration, the captain left his seat to fight the fire that was spreading {{to the rear of}} the cockpit; the Swissair volume of checklists was later found fused together in the wreckage, indicating that the captain may have attempted to use them to fan back the flames. The captain did not return to his seat; whether he was killed by the fire, asphyxiated by the smoke, or killed in the crash is not known. Flight data recording shows that engine two was shut down due to an engine fire approximately one minute before impact, implying that the first officer was still alive and continued trying to fly the aircraft until the final moments of the flight. At 22:31:18 AT (01:31:18 UTC), the aircraft struck the ocean at an estimated speed of 345mph (555km/h, 154m/s, or 299 knots) and with a force of the order of 350g, causing the aircraft to disintegrate instantly. The crash location was approximately , +/-300meters.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Russian {{president}} Boris Yeltsin disclosed five top-secret memos {{dating from}} {{a few weeks after}} the downing of KAL007 in 1983. The memos contained Soviet communications (from KGB Chief Viktor Chebrikov and Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov to General Secretary Yury Andropov) that indicated that they knew the location of KAL007's wreckage while they were simulating a search and harassing the American Navy; they had found the sought-after <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder</b> on October 20, 1983 (50 days after the incident), and had decided to keep this knowledge secret, the reason being that the tapes could not unequivocally support their firmly held view that KAL007's flight to Soviet territory was a deliberately planned intelligence mission.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{responsibility for}} investigating the incident lay with the Air Accident Investigation Board/Norway (AAIB/N), although {{the investigation and}} report was a close cooperation with the Interstate Aviation Committee {{and to a lesser}} extent, the Federal Air Transport Agency. AAIB/N had the primary responsibility for investigations at the crash site, cooperation with the Norwegian police and the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration, and writing the report. IAC was responsible for handling the investigations in Russia, the reading of the <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder,</b> the flight data recorder, the relationship with Vnukovo Airlines and a test flight. Both agencies agreed that English was to be the language of the final report; English is one of the ICAO languages.|$|E
50|$|Heavy {{vibration}} started {{shortly after}} takeoff, and the <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> recorded {{one of the}} pilots asking the tower {{to allow them to}} make a left downwind turn, that they had {{to get back on the}} ground.|$|R
50|$|Australia {{became the}} first country to mandate the {{carriage}} of <b>Cockpit</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>Recorders</b> on civil transport aircraft, a trend which was later followed by other countries. Today, all large civil transport aircraft are required to carry a CVR.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} term [...] "black box" [...] in reference to flight data <b>recorders</b> and <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> was by Mr E. Newton of the AAIB {{at a meeting of the}} Aeronautical Research Council in August 1958.|$|R
5|$|The {{weather in}} the area had wind up towards , with clouds and heavy rain, and some reports of turbulence. The {{aircraft}} was not equipped with ground proximity warning system, nor was this required. There was no requirement for the aircraft to have a flight data recorder and <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder</b> (CVR), but the airline had chosen to install the latter. Interviews with the surviving passengers showed {{that none of them}} perceived that there was any problems with the flight until the sudden impact. One of the passengers was a navigation professional and could see parts of the cockpit from his seat; he was thus able to confirm some of the navigational display readings. Interviews with locals indicated that the aircraft followed a normal path.|$|E
5|$|On 2 May 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{issued a}} Safety Recommendation {{document}} that included an interim {{summary of the}} investigation to date, {{as well as some}} immediate safety recommendations that the NTSB believes should be implemented by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to enhance flight safety. The NTSB reported that the Embraer apparently experienced a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) outage, unknown to its flight crew prior to the collision, according to the <b>Cockpit</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>Recorder</b> (CVR):Preliminary findings in the ongoing investigation indicate that, for reasons yet to be determined, the collision avoidance system in the Legacy airplane was not functioning {{at the time of the}} accident, thereby disabling the system's ability to detect and be detected by conflicting traffic. In addition, CVR data indicate that the flight crew was unaware that the collision avoidance system was not functioning until after the accident.|$|E
5|$|On November 18, 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in a {{goodwill}} {{gesture to}} South Korea {{during a visit}} to Seoul to ratify a new treaty, released both the flight data recorder (FDR) and <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder</b> (CVR) of KAL007. Initial South Korean research showed the FDR to be empty and the CVR to have an unintelligible copy. The Russians then released the recordings to the ICAO Secretary General. The ICAO report continued to support the initial assertion that KAL007 accidentally flew in Soviet airspace, after listening to the flight crew's conversations recorded by the CVR, and confirming that either the aircraft had flown on a constant magnetic heading instead of activating the INS and following its assigned waypoints, or, if it had activated the INS, it had been activated when the aircraft had already deviated beyond the 7½-nautical mile Desired Track Envelope within which the waypoints would have been captured.|$|E
2500|$|Recommendations {{included}} an urgent call for <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> and for closer co-operation between the Civil Aviation Authority and British airlines. Though the report covered {{the state of}} industrial relations at BEA, no mention was made of it in its conclusions, despite the feelings of observers that it intruded directly and comprehensively onto the aircraft's flight deck. BEA ceased to exist as a separate entity in 1974, when it and the British Overseas Airways Corporation merged to form British Airways. A recommendation of the report that all British-registered civil passenger-carrying aircraft of more than [...] all-up weight should be equipped with <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> resulted in their fitting becoming mandatory on larger British-registered airliners from 1973.|$|R
50|$|Broadcast audio {{must have}} a good {{signal-to-noise}} ratio, where speech or music is a bare minimum of 16db above {{the noise of the}} recording or transmission system. For audio that has a much poorer signal-to-noise ratio (like <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorders),</b> sonic enhancement is recommended.|$|R
50|$|At first, {{the task}} of finding out what had {{happened}} to flight 781 was difficult. In 1954, there were no <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> or flight data recorders (the so-called black boxes) to assist crash investigators. Also, no established protocol for aircraft accident investigation existed at the time.|$|R
5|$|The French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into the crash; it was joined by its German counterpart, the Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation (BFU), and was assisted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Hours after the crash, the BEA sent seven investigators to the crash site; these were accompanied by representatives from Airbus and CFM International. The <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder,</b> which was damaged but still usable, was recovered by rescue workers and was examined by the investigation team. The following week, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin announced that the flight data recorder, which was blackened by fire but still usable, had also been found. Investigators isolated 150 sets of DNA, which were compared with the DNA of the victims' families.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by Brazil's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos, CENIPA). Data from the flight data recorder and <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder</b> (CVR) were downloaded by the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States commencing July 20 and 23 respectively. Based on preliminary data from the FDR, on July 25 Airbus cautioned A320 operators to ensure that both thrust levers are set to idle during flare. The transcript of the CVR was released on August 1. It shows that the pilots were aware of the wet runway conditions and the deactivated thrust reverser. The pilots' comments suggest that the spoilers did not deploy and that they were unable to slow the aircraft. Crew error has not been ruled out.|$|E
5|$|The VOR/DME {{system was}} {{tested by the}} Civil Aviation Administration on 7 May and found to be working correctly. AIBN {{established}} a base of operations at the hangar at Brønnøysund Airport and used a helicopter to freight {{the pieces of the}} wreck there and bodies to Trondheim University Hospital for identification. Technical investigations started on 9 May. The aircraft was equipped with a flight data recorder and a <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder.</b> Both were found intact and were decoded at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch in the United Kingdom. Improper use of the microphone made it difficult to hear the captain's voice, but it was possible to reconstruct the conversations and line of events. A memorial service was held on 10 May and was attended by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. The last Home Guard personnel concluded their work on 11 May and the police concluded their investigations at Torghatten on 13 May.|$|E
5000|$|A towed pinger locator is a {{water-borne}} device used {{to locate}} the sonar [...] "ping" [...] from the underwater locator beacon which is fitted to the <b>Cockpit</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>Recorders</b> and Flight Data Recorders installed in commercial airliners. They can locate pingers at depths of up to 20,000 ft underwater.|$|R
50|$|The Honeywell Commercial Aviation {{business}} unit creates products for large commercial and regional aircraft such as auxiliary power units (APUs), aircraft environmental control systems, electric power systems, engine system accessories, flight data and <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorders,</b> {{air traffic management}} solutions, radar, navigation and communications systems, aircraft lighting, wheels and brakes.|$|R
25|$|On 5 November 1997, a Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340-300, G-VSKY, made an {{emergency}} landing following an undercarriage malfunction. Part of the undercarriage collapsed on landing, and both aircraft and runway were damaged. Recommendations made {{as a result of}} the accident included one that aircraft cabin door simulators should more accurately reproduce operating characteristics in {{an emergency}}, and another that <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> should have a two-hour duration in aircraft registered before April 1998.|$|R
5|$|Two {{parallel}} investigations were undertaken, one by HSL {{and one by}} Namdal Police District. The latter criticized the former because there were not given access to the <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder</b> (CVR). Since 1989 both {{the police and the}} prosecuting authority had not been represented in the accident investigations. HSL emphasized that they had no legal obligation to submit the tapes to the police, that the police had not asked for the tapes after Widerøe Flight 839 in 1990 and that the Ministry of Transport and Communications supported this line. The reason for the rules was that the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want the records from the CVR to be used in criminal cases against pilots. The investigation board stated that they would forward any information which supported criminal violations, while Namdal Police District stated that it was necessary for an independent police investigation to identify any criminal violations. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate's director Georg Apenes supported the police in their request for the tapes.|$|E
25|$|The job of {{investigating}} the crash was made difficult {{due to the}} aircraft having neither a flight data recorder or <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both flight {{recorder}}s, the <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorder</b> (CVR) and {{the flight}} data recorder (FDR) were recovered in the afternoon following the crash and were subsequently sent to the Lufthansa Technik laboratories in Germany for analysis.|$|E
500|$|At 5:56p.m. (16:56 UTC), {{one minute}} and 56 seconds into the flight, the plane {{disappeared}} from radar screens. Officials later determined that the plane went into a diving right turn before vanishing from radar screens. Burning wreckage was scattered for 200 to 300 metres near houses in Niederhasli, some [...] northwest of the runway at Zurich's Kloten airport. The flight data and <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> were recovered from the accident scene, both heavily damaged.|$|R
50|$|The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) were {{requested}} by Papua New Guinean Government in assisting the crash investigation. However, the ATSB could only {{determine the cause}} of the crash without the FDR and the CVR, as both flight recorders were not mandatory to be equipped on a Twin Otter, based on aviation regulations. The lack of both flight data and <b>cockpit</b> <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> adversely affected a full understanding of the accident by the investigation.|$|R
