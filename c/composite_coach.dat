5000|$|The <b>composite</b> <b>coach</b> was a {{standard}} coach design {{going back to}} the early days of railways, enabling a railway company to provide multi-class passenger accommodation in a single vehicle and so reduce costs. In the book [...] "Red For Danger" [...] by L.T.C Rolt it is mentioned that the train which came to grief at Wigan on the night of 2 August 1873 featured a Caledonian Railway <b>composite</b> <b>coach.</b> Early composite coaches did not feature corridors or gangways between the vehicles.|$|E

50|$|On 24 November 1904, the {{remainder}} of the railway's rolling stock was sold by auction at the GWR's yard in Swindon. At this time, there were four <b>composite</b> <b>coaches,</b> a passenger van, fifteen goods wagons and a goods brake van. One of the coaches was bought by the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway, and the other three went to the West Sussex Railway.|$|R
5000|$|Miners' trains [...] "...were {{old wooden}} six-wheelers with wooden seats [...]. The {{compartments}} were extremely narrow and stank to high heaven of coal dust and 'Tom Twist' an almost lethal tobacco beloved by the colliers both for smoking and chewing." [...] These trains were [...] "upgraded" [...] to public passenger status by adding an extra <b>composite</b> <b>coach,</b> complete with First Class compartment and lavatory.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009 a {{decision}} was made to change the livery on all rolling stock except for the Golden Pass Panorama and Golden Pass Classic trains. This was to include the various railways and funiculars marketed under the [...] "Golden Pass" [...] banner and the buses operated by the company. The colour scheme is to be a gold (lower portion) and white (upper portion) with all stock being rebranded [...] "Golden Pass". The new colours will be applied to the stock as it passes through works, although the [...] "Golden Pass" [...] logo will be applied as soon as practicable. The first vehicle to be reliveried, First / Second <b>Composite</b> <b>Coach</b> AB307, appeared in traffic on 27 August 2010 (1).|$|E
50|$|Consideration {{was given}} to the {{preservation}} of locomotive No.1 Macrory but, in the end, no locomotives were preserved. It is believed that this is due to an ill-informed belief among those in charge of its fate that the locomotive was of a different track gauge to the rest of Ireland, {{due to the fact that}} it was built and owned by a British company, however this was not the case. Only a 6-wheel <b>composite</b> <b>coach</b> was saved and can now be found in the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, Cultra, Co. Down. However, a GNR(I) 2-4-2t JT class locomotive, No. 93 which worked on the Greenore line has also been preserved and is displayed with the DNGR coach in Cultra. All the locomotive nameplates, however, are preserved.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{critical}} experience on international executives can have serious consequences, assignments may fail. So coaching support may enhance their psychological capital and global competencies. This small heuristic study involved five co-researchers specialised in coaching international executives {{across the world}} on career and leadership development. The themes and qualities of their coaching approaches were synthesised into a <b>composite</b> <b>coaching</b> framework, triangulated with literature and; highlighted person-environment matching based on experience of nomadic work/life style {{and the use of}} home-world coaching dialogue to appreciate ‘home as a process’...|$|R
50|$|An inauguration {{ceremony}} {{was held on}} 30 June 1852. The cannons and band of the 48th Regiment were present at Marshes Turnpike Gate for {{the departure of the}} first train at 2.30pm. Regular services on the line commenced on 1 July 1852 and consisted of three passenger trains each way at 7.00am, 12.00pm and 4.00pm from Newport, and 10.00am, 2.00pm and 6.00pm for the return journey. The line was worked by two new engines, numbers 17 and 18, with two <b>composite</b> <b>coaches,</b> four second class and six third class carriages provided by Wrights of Birmingham.|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{the engine}} of the mail train was derailed and tossed clear, the tender was derailed but {{remained}} on the track. The sudden deceleration caused the two vans, the front <b>composite</b> <b>coach</b> and first 3rd class coach to violently telescope. The rear 3rd class coach hit {{the rear of the}} front coach, forcing the front of the carriage to become entangled with the coach ahead of it, causing both underframes to bend upwards until it came to rest leaning {{on the north side of}} the bridge. Part of the roof off was torn off and thrown onto the bridge. The rear composite and the cars behind it came to an abrupt halt, but remained on the rails, each receiving varying amounts of damage.|$|E
5000|$|For its {{suburban}} railways the Southern {{continued the}} L&SWR practice {{of running a}} three-car EMU off-peak and an unpowered two-car trailer between two three-car units during peak hours. Most of the EMUs were re-built by the Southern from locomotive-hauled stock, mounted on new underframes and fitted with Westinghouse electrical equipment. In the 1930s electrication was extended to main lines, from [...] to [...] and [...] on 1 January 1933. For semi-fast services the 4Lav was designed; one <b>composite</b> <b>coach</b> had two toilets, one for first class and another for second class. For fast services six-car units were developed with a Pullman car or pantry in the set; three units had three first class trailers {{as well as the}} Pullman car for peak London Bridge services. The Brighton Belle was an all-Pullman EMU, providing 'at seat' meal service during the journey between London and Brighton.|$|E
50|$|The 10:00 pm LMS down {{passenger}} {{and mail}} express from Leeds to Bristol consisted of Midland Railway Class 3 4-4-0 No. 714 steam locomotive hauling a 6-wheel tender, a 6-wheeled parcels van, a goods van, a composite passenger coach, two third-class coaches, another <b>composite</b> <b>coach,</b> a TPO sorting van, a TPO tender, {{a pair of}} TPO vans and a passenger brake van. Of these cars, the parcels van, front composite, both 3rd class Coaches and all four TPO vehicles' lighting was powered by flammable gases. In total, the train was carrying 23 gas canisters in these carriages. Only the front goods van had been constructed with electrical lighting, whilst the rear composite and brake van were built to use gas lighting, but had been converted. All eleven carriages were wooden and {{old at the time}} of the crash, with the newest coach being the goods van which was built in 1915, the oldest vehicles were the TPO vans which dated back to 1885.|$|E
50|$|Series AB, First/Second <b>Composite</b> bogie <b>coach</b> with 23 {{first and}} 22 second class seats, {{numbered}} 221, built by SIG in 1946 and purchased from SBB (Brünig) in 1997, scrapped 2006.|$|R
5000|$|In the BR Mk1 era, non-gangwayed <b>composite</b> <b>coaches</b> were {{constructed}} {{for use on}} suburban lines, these had a side corridor connecting all the compartments of one class to a central toilet, with a similar corridor connecting the compartments of the other class to a different toilet. Thus first class passengers could move between the first class compartments, and third/second class passengers likewise move about their area, {{but there was no}} communication between the classes or to adjacent coaches. A non-gangwayed Corridor Composite of this type, designated [...] "CL" [...] (as opposed to CK for the gangwayed version), is preserved at the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway.|$|R
50|$|The train {{consists}} of one <b>composite</b> 1A/2A <b>coach</b> (HA-1), one 2A coach (A-1), four 3A (B-1/B-2/B-3/B-4), eight sleeper, one pantry car, no general coaches and two SLR coaches. Sometimes {{one or two}} high-capacity parcel vans may be attached. Total coach count is usually 20 or 21.|$|R
50|$|After {{their initial}} use as {{shunting}} locomotives, they took on passenger duties on the Vale of Glamorgan Railway. Two sets of two coaches {{were prepared for}} the role. They comprised a four-wheeled 1888 <b>composite</b> <b>coach</b> and a six-wheeled 1895 brake third which were close coupled. They were known as ‘Motor Sets’. At {{one end of the}} brake third was a driver’s compartment which, unusually, did not have regulator equipment to control the locomotive fitted. Instead a bell system was installed so that the driver could send instructions to the fireman in the locomotive. The controls available in the driver’s compartment were a brake and whistle controls which were operated by wires that ran {{along the top of the}} coaches and were attached to pulleys located on the dome and cab roof. The E Class operated with one set as a push-pull unit or with both sets located either side of the engine. This arrangement was used mainly on trains between Barry and Llantwit Major. However, when John Auld was appointed as Locomotive Superintendent in 1909, he did not favour the push-pull arrangement and subsequently ordered that trains should revert to running the engine around the train at the end of its journey.|$|E
50|$|For {{the opening}} of {{passenger}} services, the Manx Northern Railway ordered fourteen six-wheeled coaches built to the Cleminson system, a first {{on the island and}} using a complex system of six-wheeled arrangement whereby the middle set were not fixed. This arrangement allowed the outer wheels to pivot and the centre pair to slide from side to side thus allowing the coached to more easily negotiate tight curves than a rigid wheelbase. Expensively constructed, they proved to be troublesome in traffic, so much so that in service after the amalgamation with the Isle of Man Railway Company they saw little further use, occasionally being used for school traffic. A number of examples survive in preservation (see below). For the Foxdale branch a special bogie coach with enhanced braking capabilities was constructed by the Oldbury Carriage and Wagon Co. in 1886. It was a <b>composite</b> <b>coach</b> with a guard’s compartment, three third class compartments and one first class compartment specially for the Foxdale Mines’ Captain. To celebrate the centenary of the Manx Northern Railway in 1979, the coach was restored to its original livery. which it carried until 2001 when it reverted to the standard livery of red and cream. It remains in regular service today. Almost all of the original non-passenger stock was lost with only one closed van surviving today (Gr.12) which was rebuilt in 2001.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{partition}} of Ireland in 1921, royal trains were occasionally used for the British Royal family when Ireland was under British rule. In 1897 the Great Northern Railway provided a new Royal train of six vehicles comprising a drawing room saloon, a dining saloon, first-class carriage, <b>composite</b> <b>coach,</b> and two vans. This was constructed in their own workshops and used {{for the first time}} during a visit by the Duke of York and Duchess of York in September 1897 and a trip from Banagher to Clara over the tracks of the Great Southern and Western Railway. This use of a Royal Train continued in Northern Ireland until the last British royal train there in the 1950s.The Great Western Railway abandoned its old royal saloons of 1897 during the 1930s and borrowed stock from the London, Midland and Scottish Railway when required. After the Second World War they provided new saloons for their own Royal Train. In 1941 the London Midland and Scottish Railway built three armour-plated saloons for the King. Shortly after the war, the armour plating was removed. Two of these have survived into preservation.After the formation of British Railways in 1948, the individual regions continued to maintain the constituent railway companies' Royal Train carriages. A single [...] "Royal Train" [...] was formed in 1977 {{as a response to the}} demands of the Silver Jubilee. The Royal Family have also travelled on ordinary service trains more frequently in recent years to minimise costs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} {{part of the}} Wellington - Manawatu Line built by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR). The line to Paremata station, which {{was close to the}} Paremata Barracks ruins, was opened on 21 September 1885, without ceremony. The first train with 59 people aboard had three <b>composite</b> <b>coaches</b> and a van. Cobb & Co built stables at Paremata, and from October 1885 an early train leaving town at 7 a.m. made it possible to travel from Wellington to Wanganui in one day by rail and coach. The line was extended to Plimmerton in October, and Pukerua Bay {{by the end of the}} year. The line was extended to Paekakariki in 1886, and was electrified (with locomotive-hauled carriage trains) in 1940 after the opening of the Tawa Flat deviation.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{the railway}} used 30 ft 2-axle coaches, {{by the time}} {{services}} to Sheffield were introduced the company had 4-axle 51 ft <b>composite</b> corridor <b>coaches</b> on bogies. Most of the rolling stock was for freight; in 1923 the company had 4,808 freight wagons of which over 3,000 were open wagons. Additionally the company possessed a snow plough, since the cuttings in the Yorkshire Wolds were prone to drifts when snow occurred.|$|R
5000|$|Series AB, First/Second <b>Composite</b> saloon bogie <b>coach</b> No. 204, with 24 {{first and}} 23 second class seats, built by SIG in 1938 and rebuilt in 1997 {{can also be}} found at the depot of La Traction.|$|R
