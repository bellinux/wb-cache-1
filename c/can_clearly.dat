5|$|Twyfelfontein valley {{has been}} {{inhabited}} by Stone-age hunter-gatherers of the Wilton stone age culture group since approximately 6,000 years ago.

The Khoikhoi also produced rock art which <b>can</b> <b>clearly</b> be distinguished from the older engravings.|$|E

5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they <b>can</b> <b>clearly</b> hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes provides the bat {{with the ability to}} estimate the range to their prey.|$|E
5|$|Medusae {{and complex}} {{swimming}} colonies such as siphonophores and chondrophores sense tilt and acceleration {{by means of}} statocysts, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called statoliths. If the body tilts in the wrong direction, the animal rights itself by increasing {{the strength of the}} swimming movements on the side that is too low. Most species have ocelli ("simple eyes"), which can detect sources of light. However the agile Box Jellyfish are unique among Medusae because they possess four kinds of true eyes that have retinas, corneas and lenses. Although the eyes probably do not form images, Cubozoa <b>can</b> <b>clearly</b> distinguish the direction from which light is coming as well as negotiate around solid-colored objects.|$|E

In combining performance, play and self-exposure, Woodman’s photographs create extreme and often disturbing psychological states. In concealing or encrypting her subjects she reminds the viewer that photographs flatten and distort, never offering the whole truth about a subject.|$|E

25|$|The known {{remains of}} Samarra occupy {{an area of}} {{approximately}} , mostly {{on the east side}} of the Tigris. Out of 6,314 registered buildings at the site (as of 1991), only nine still have any components of significant height; the vast majority of the ruins consist of collapsed mounds of rammed earth and scattered debris. At ground level, the remains are mostly unimpressive; when viewed from the air, however, the entire plan of the Abbasid city, with its buildings and street pattern, <b>can</b> <b>clearly</b> be seen.|$|E
25|$|It can {{be argued}} that within this {{backdrop}} of mostly indistinguishable types, exceptions would be far more pronounced. Atypical reverses are usually seen during and after periods of war, at which time emperors make various claims of liberation, subjugation, and pacification. Some of these reverse images <b>can</b> <b>clearly</b> be classified as propaganda. An example struck by emperor Philip in 244 features a legend proclaiming the establishment of peace with Persia; in truth, Rome had been forced to pay large sums in tribute to the Persians.|$|E
25|$|This comment has {{traditionally}} caused commentators {{to conclude that}} Luke was a Gentile.

Although Luke is considered likely to be a Gentile Christian, some scholars believe him to be a Hellenized Jew. The phrase could just as easily be used to differentiate between those Christians who strictly observed the rituals of Judaism and those who did not.|$|E

25|$|A form {{of these}} arms {{was first used}} by King William the Lion in the 12th century, though no trace {{of them can be}} made out on his seal. However, a lion rampant <b>can</b> <b>clearly</b> be made out on the seal of his son, Alexander II. Over the years many writers have claimed them to be much older; even Alexander Nisbet, {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} more reliable Scottish heralds, claims that a lion was first adopted as a personal symbol by the legendary Fergus, with the royal tressure being added in the reign of Achaius. This is clearly untrue as, even if Fergus and Achaius had existed, they predate the existence of heraldry by several centuries.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 18 April 2012, the website of The Scotsman {{newspaper}} made available an extended 6 minute 23 second video of the proceedings. The extended video comprises visual footage from the standardised 4 minute 40 second video but a different audio track. The extended version is of note, because the audio track comprises 66 seconds of Jack Davidson QC's plea in mitigation. It was previously stated in the press that this specifically would not be filmed. Also included in the extended version is 4 seconds of heckling {{from members of the}} public gallery as David Gilroy is being led away. The majority of the heckling is inaudible, but someone <b>can</b> <b>clearly</b> be heard shouting 'die' before a court room police officer says 'quiet please'.|$|E
25|$|The {{kinematic}} {{connection between}} spiral and lenticular galaxies is most clear when analyzing the Tully–Fisher relation for spiral and lenticular samples. If lenticular galaxies are an evolved stage of spiral galaxies {{then they should}} have a similar Tully–Fisher relation with spirals, but with an offset in the luminosity / absolute magnitude axis. This would result from brighter, redder stars dominating the stellar populations of lenticulars. An example of this effect {{can be seen in the}} adjacent plot. One <b>can</b> <b>clearly</b> see that the best-fit lines for the spiral galaxy data and the lenticular galaxy have the same slope (and thus follow the same Tully–Fisher relation), but are offset by ΔI ≈ 1.5. This implies that lenticular galaxies were once spiral galaxies but are now dominated by old, red stars.|$|E
