5|$|Bears, crocodiles, golden jackals, leopards {{and snakes}} {{are the main}} predators of the jungle <b>cat.</b> The golden jackal, particularly, can be a major {{competitor}} to the <b>cat.</b> When it encounters a threat, the jungle <b>cat</b> will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing sounds like small roars – a behavior uncommon for {{the other members of}} Felis. The meow of the jungle <b>cat</b> is also somewhat lower than that of a typical domestic <b>cat.</b> The jungle <b>cat</b> can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E
5|$|The jungle <b>cat</b> (Felis chaus), {{also called}} the reed <b>cat</b> or swamp <b>cat,</b> is a {{medium-sized}} <b>cat</b> native to the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia and southern China.

40|$|Domestic <b>cats</b> (Felis catus) {{were first}} brought to Hawai‘i aboard sailing ships of European explorers and colonists. The job of these predators was to control {{mice and rats}} on the ships during the long voyages. As in other places, <b>cats</b> were taken in and adopted by the {{families}} of Hawai‘i and soon became household pets known as popoki. But <b>cats</b> have always been very well equipped to live and hunt on their own. On tropical archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands where no other predatory mammals of comparable size existed, abundant and naïve prey were particularly easy game, and <b>cats</b> soon thrived in the wild. Although the details of when <b>cats</b> first came {{to live in the}} wild remain little known, adventurers, writers, and naturalists of the day recorded some important observations. Feral <b>cats</b> were observed in remote wilderness around Kīlauea volcano on Hawai‘i Island as early as 1840 by explorer William Brackenridge. Mark Twain was so impressed by the great abundance of <b>cats</b> when he visited Honolulu in 1866 that he reported his observations in the Sacramento Union newspaper, which were later reprinted in his book Roughing It: I saw… tame <b>cats,</b> wild <b>cats,</b> singed <b>cats,</b> individual <b>cats,</b> groups of <b>cats,</b> platoons of <b>cats,</b> companies of <b>cats,</b> regiments of <b>cats,</b> armies of <b>cats,</b> multitudes of <b>cats,</b> millions of <b>cats...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} this tale narrates that when the youngest daughter-in-law was pregnant, she secretly ate the food-offerings ritually dedicated to Shashthi and then blamed the theft on the black <b>cat.</b> Angered by the dishonour of its mistress and the unjust accusation of theft, the <b>cat</b> pledged to teach the young mother a lesson. In {{this version of the}} tale, the <b>cat</b> not only stole her six children, but also ate them. But when the seventh child was born, the mother caught the <b>cat</b> fleeing with her child and followed it but tripped in middle of the chase and fainted. The <b>cat</b> took the infant to Shashthi's abode, where she told the goddess the whole tale of her insult. The benign goddess, however, was annoyed with the <b>cat</b> and rushed to the aid of the mother. The goddess explained the reason of her suffering, and after the mother had begged the <b>cat</b> for forgiveness and had sworn to worship Shashthi on anointed days, all seven of her children were returned to her.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} cats is {{referred}} to as a clowder or a glaring, a male <b>cat</b> is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered), an unaltered female is called a queen, and a juvenile <b>cat</b> {{is referred to}} as a kitten. The male progenitor of a <b>cat,</b> especially a pedigreed <b>cat,</b> is its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now obsolete word catling.|$|E
5|$|A pedigreed <b>cat</b> is {{one whose}} ancestry is {{recorded}} by a <b>cat</b> fancier organization. A purebred <b>cat</b> is one whose ancestry contains only individuals {{of the same}} breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as show cats. Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry {{are referred to as}} domestic short-haired or domestic long-haired cats, by coat type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly British), or (using terms borrowed from dog breeding) mongrels or mutt-cats.|$|E
50|$|Interaction {{with other}} <b>cats</b> with strains or {{diseases}} related to FeLV {{can be a}} great risk factor for <b>cats</b> attaining FeLV themselves. Therefore, a main factor in prevention is keeping the affected <b>cats</b> in quarantine from the unaffected <b>cats.</b> Stray <b>cats,</b> or indoor/outdoor <b>cats</b> {{have been shown to be}} at a greater risk for acquiring FeLV, since they have a greater chance of interacting with other <b>cats.</b> Domesticated <b>cats</b> that are kept indoors are the least vulnerable to susceptible diseases.|$|R

50|$|A working <b>cats</b> {{program is}} {{designed}} to place <b>cats</b> in safe environments where they are valued for their hunting skills as working <b>cats.</b> These programs are typically offered by animal shelters who will use otherwise unadoptable <b>cats</b> in the program as an alternative to euthanasia. The <b>cats</b> may not be suitable for adoption because they are feral <b>cats</b> or did not acclimate to living in close quarters with humans. Working <b>cats</b> programs usually provide <b>cats</b> that are spayed or neutered and fully vaccinated, and any adoption fee is often waived.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate serum cystatin C (sCysC) and urinary cystatin C (uCysC) in <b>cats</b> with hyperthyroidism and <b>cats</b> with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Methods: Thirty <b>cats</b> with FIV, 26 hyperthyroid <b>cats</b> and 28 healthy <b>cats</b> were included. sCysC and uCysC:creatinine (uCysC/uCr) ratio were measured with a human particle-enhanced nephelometric immunoassay, previously validated for feline CysC measurement. Routine renal variables (serum creatinine [sCr], urine specific gravity, urinary protein:creatinine ratio [UPC]) were also measured in the three groups. Results: <b>Cats</b> with hyperthyroidism had significantly higher sCysC and higher uCysC/uCr ratio, lower sCr and a higher UPC than healthy <b>cats.</b> <b>Cats</b> with FIV infection did not show a significantly higher sCysC concentration but had a significantly higher sCr and UPC than healthy <b>cats.</b> uCysC could be detected in only four of them. Conclusions and relevance: This study demonstrated that sCysC is increased in <b>cats</b> with hyperthyroidism, in contrast with sCr, but not in <b>cats</b> with FIV. Many hyperthyroid <b>cats,</b> but only four <b>cats</b> with FIV, had an elevated uCysC/uCr ratio. Further studies may reveal if uCysC might be a valuable marker for tubular dysfunction in <b>cats...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} (DKA) {{has long}} been considered a key clinical feature of type- 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) in humans although. An increasing {{number of cases of}} ketoacidosis have been reported in people with type- 2 DM. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: <b>Cats</b> initially diagnosed with DKA can achieve remission from diabetes. <b>Cats</b> with DKA and diabetic remission {{are more likely to have}} been administered glucocorticoids before diagnosis. ANIMALS: Twelve <b>cats</b> with DKA and 7 <b>cats</b> with uncomplicated DM. METHODS: Retrospective case review. Medical records of <b>cats</b> presenting with DKA or DM were evaluated. Diabetic remission was defined as being clinically unremarkable for at least 1 month after insulin withdrawal. The <b>cats</b> were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) <b>cats</b> with DKA and diabetic remission; (2) <b>cats</b> with DKA without diabetic remission; and (3) <b>cats</b> with DM and diabetic remission. RESULTS: Seven <b>cats</b> with DKA had remission from diabetes. These <b>cats</b> had significantly higher concentrations of leukocytes and segmented neutrophils, and significantly lower concentrations of eosinophils in blood and had pancreatic disease more often than did <b>cats</b> with uncomplicated DM and diabetic remission. With regard to pretreatment, 3 / 7 <b>cats</b> in group 1, 1 / 5 <b>cats</b> in group 2, and 1 / 7 <b>cats</b> in group 3 had been treated with glucocorticoids. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Remission of DM in <b>cats</b> presenting with DKA is possible. <b>Cats</b> with DKA and remission have more components of a stress leucogram, pancreatic disease, and seemed to be treated more often with glucocorticoids than <b>cats</b> with uncomplicated DM and diabetic remission...|$|R
5|$|In 1634, another tale with a trickster <b>cat</b> as hero was {{published}} in Giambattista Basile's collection Pentamerone although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved {{in a manner similar}} to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to the <b>cat,</b> promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the <b>cat</b> decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead <b>cat</b> by its paws and throw it out the window. The <b>cat</b> leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life. The <b>cat</b> then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, the <b>cat</b> performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare cutaneous mycoflora isolation and CD 4 +:CD 8 + ratio in feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) -infected <b>cats</b> with that in FIV-uninfected <b>cats.</b> Sixty <b>cats</b> were examined. Twenty-five were Fly-infected <b>cats</b> and 35 were RV-uninfected <b>cats.</b> All 60 <b>cats</b> were FeLV-negative. Fungi were speciated and immunophenotyping of peripheral CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes was performed. At least one fungal colony was isolated from 22 / 25 (88 %) FIV-infected <b>cats.</b> Among the FIV-uninfected <b>cats</b> fungal colonies were recovered from 13 / 35 (37 %) specimens. Dermatophytes were recovered from 2 / 25 (8 %) FIV-infected <b>cats</b> (one Microsporum gypseum, one Microsporum can is) and 3 / 35 (8. 5 %) FIV-uninfected <b>cats</b> (M gypseum). Malassezia species was the most commonly isolated organism from both groups of <b>cats</b> (51. 6 %). Malassezia species was more commonly isolated from FIV-infected <b>cats</b> than RV-uninfected <b>cats</b> (84 % vs 28. 6 %). The CD 4 + to CD 8 + lymphocyte ratio for FIV-infected <b>cats</b> was significantly lower than the CD 4 + to CD 8 + ratio in the FIV-uninfected <b>cats.</b> The CD 4 + to CD 8 + lymphocyte ratio for FIV-infected <b>cats</b> with cutaneous overall fungal isolation was significantly lower than the CD 4 :CD 8 lymphocyte ratio in the FIV-infected <b>cats</b> but without cutaneous fungal isolation. We can conclude that immunologic depletion due to retroviral infection might represent a risk factor to cutaneous fungal colonization in <b>cats.</b> (C) 2010 ISFM and AAFP.

40|$|Objectives: Hypertension is {{a common}} cause of {{proteinuria}} in HIV-infected people. In <b>cats,</b> feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection appears {{to be associated with}} proteinuria. Therefore, the results from systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements in naturally infected FIV-positive <b>cats</b> were reviewed to assess whether hypertension contributes to the observed proteinuria in these <b>cats.</b> Ultrasonographic findings in FIV-positive <b>cats</b> were reviewed to complete renal assessment and to extend the scant knowledge on renal ultrasonography in <b>cats.</b> Methods: Data from client-owned, naturally infected FIV-positive <b>cats</b> were retrospectively reviewed. To obtain a control group, records were reviewed from age-matched, privately owned, FIV-negative <b>cats.</b> Results: Data from 91 FIV-infected and 113 control <b>cats</b> were compared. FIV-infected <b>cats</b> showed a significantly lower SBP (P 0. 4) occurred more frequently in FIV-infected <b>cats</b> (P < 0. 001). Renal ultrasonography showed abnormalities in 60 / 91 FIV-infected <b>cats,</b> with hyperechogenic cortices in 39 / 91 and enlarged kidneys in 31 / 91. Conclusions and relevance: Hypertension can be excluded as a common cause of renal damage leading to proteinuria in FIV-infected <b>cats.</b> Proteinuria and poorly concentrated urine are common in naturally infected FIV-positive <b>cats,</b> in contrast to azotaemia. Clinicians should cautiously interpret ultrasonographic abnormalities as these occur in over half of FIV-infected <b>cats...</b>|$|R
