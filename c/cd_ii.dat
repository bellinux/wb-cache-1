40|$|We {{have made}} a {{large-scale}} map of the 158 micrometers C(+) line toward the L 1630 /Orion B molecular cloud. The map covers a approximately 35 min x 45 min area which includes the NGC 2024 H II region, zeta Ori, the reflection nebula NGC 2023, and the Horsehead nebula. Emission in the (<b>C</b> <b>II)</b> line is very widespread. The line was detected at levels in excess of a few 10 (exp - 4) ergs/sq cm/s/sr over almost the entire mapped region. Extended emission associated with the NGC 2024 H II region and its envelope {{accounts for more than}} half of the (<b>C</b> <b>II)</b> flux. Over this approximately 1. 5 x 2. 5 pc region, the amount of gas-phase carbon in the form of C(+) is comparable to the amount of carbon in CO. This result, together with the (<b>C</b> <b>II)</b> distribution, implies that (<b>C</b> <b>II)</b> emission arises on the surfaces of clumps throughout the cloud rather than in a single layer at the H II region boundary. Away from the H II region, most of the (<b>C</b> <b>II)</b> emission comes from the western edge of the L 1630 cloud and probably results from excitation by external OB stars. The overall extent of the (<b>C</b> <b>II)</b> emission is comparable to that of millimeter molecular lines, but the distributions are different in detail. The difference in (<b>C</b> <b>II)</b> and molecular line distributions, in particular, the larger extent of the (<b>C</b> <b>II)</b> emission west of NGC 2024 implies large variations in the radio of the (<b>C</b> <b>II)</b> and CO J = 1 goes to 0 intensities. Models of photon-dominated regions can explain the relation between (<b>C</b> <b>II)</b> and CO intensities only if one considers the cloud edges and cloud interior separately.

40|$|The atomic <b>C</b> <b>II</b> fine-structure line {{is one of}} the {{brightest}} lines in a typical star-forming galaxy spectrum with a luminosity ~ 0. 1 %- 1 % of the bolometric luminosity. It is potentially a reliable tracer of the dense gas distribution at high redshifts and could provide an additional probe to the era of reionization. By taking into account the spontaneous, stimulated, and collisional emission of the <b>C</b> <b>II</b> line, we calculate the spin temperature and the mean intensity {{as a function of the}} redshift. When averaged over a cosmologically large volume, we find that the <b>C</b> <b>II</b> emission from ionized carbon in individual galaxies is larger than the signal generated by carbon in the intergalactic medium. Assuming that the <b>C</b> <b>II</b> luminosity is proportional to the carbon mass in dark matter halos, we also compute the power spectrum of the <b>C</b> <b>II</b> line intensity at various redshifts. In order to avoid the contamination from CO rotational lines at low redshift when targeting a <b>C</b> <b>II</b> survey at high redshifts, we propose the cross-correlation of <b>C</b> <b>II</b> and 21 cm line emission from high redshifts. To explore the detectability of the <b>C</b> <b>II</b> signal from reionization, we also evaluate the expected errors on the <b>C</b> <b>II</b> power spectrum and C II- 21 cm cross power spectrum based on the design of the future millimeter surveys.

40|$|Sweet potato peels {{was used}} for the removal of <b>Cd</b> (<b>II)</b> from aqueous solutions. The residue was characterised using SEM, EDX, XRF, N 2 BET, TGA and ATR-FTIR. Sorption of <b>Cd</b> (<b>II)</b> was carried out by varying pH, contact time and initial ion {{concentration}} at 25 °C and the results showed a strong dependence of the ion removal on the adsorbate pH with optimum observed at pH 7. Kinetics of <b>Cd</b> (<b>II)</b> sorption indicates optimum time of 180 min and the removal of <b>Cd</b> (<b>II)</b> occurred via a fast initial uptake. This was modelled using the pseudo first, pseudo-second and intraparticle diffusion models. The pseudo-first order gave a better description of the uptake kinetics than the pseudo-second order model with an r 2 value of 0. 99. The intraparticle-diffusion model showed that sorption had multi-linear steps indicating that the intraparticle-diffusion is not the only rate controlling step in <b>Cd</b> (<b>II)</b> sorption. FTIR analysis of the PTPS before and after adsorption of <b>Cd</b> (<b>II)</b> indicates that some functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxylate groups may be involved in metal ion sorption. Isotherm modelling of <b>Cd</b> (<b>II)</b> sorption was carried out using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms using a non-linear optimisation.
