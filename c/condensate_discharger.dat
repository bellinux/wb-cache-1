40|$|Industrial steam users {{recognize}} the need to reduce system cost {{in order to remain}} internationally competitive. Steam systems are a key utility that influence cost significantly, and represent a high value opportunity target. However, the quality of steam is often taken for granted, even overlooked at times. When the recent global recession challenged companies to remain profitable as a first priority, the result was that maintenance budgets were cut and long term cost reduction initiatives for steam systems set aside due to more pressing issues. One of the regrettable results of such actions is that knowledgeable personnel are re-assigned, retired, or released when necessary steam system cost reduction programs are eliminated. When the time arrives to refocus on long term cost reduction by improving the steam system, some programs may have to start from the beginning and a clear path forward may not be evident. New personnel are often tasked with steam improvements when the programs restart, and they may experience difficulty in determining the true key factors that can help reduce system cost. The urgency for lowering long term fuel use and reducing the cost of producing steam is near for each plant. Population growth and resultant global demand are inevitable, so the global economy will expand, production will increase, more fossil fuel energy will be needed, and that fuel will become scarce and more costly. Although fuel prices are low now, energy costs can be expected to trend significantly upward as global production and demand increase. Now is the time for plants to make certain that they can deliver high quality steam to process equipment at lowest system cost. There are three stages to help optimize plant steam for best performance at a low system cost; Phase 1 : Manage the <b>condensate</b> <b>discharge</b> locations (where the steam traps & valves are located), Phase 2 : Optimize steam-using equipment, and Phase 3 : Optimize the entire steam system. This presentation will focus primarily on management of the <b>condensate</b> <b>discharge</b> locations (CDLs) and show sites how to use readily available data to more efficiently achieve goals; but will also provide insight into how the three stages interact to reduce system cost and improve process performance...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{emphasis}} on energy management has helped sites reduce system cost through {{the diagnosis and}} repair of ?Leaking? or ?Blowing? steam traps (?Leakage Failures?). Timely maintenance response is a significant action to lower energy use and GHG emissions generated by steam production. But, what action should be taken with Cold Traps? In every steam trap survey to determine the steam trap population?s current state of health, there are usually {{a significant amount of}} steam traps determined to be ?Cold? or ?Low Temp? (?Drainage Failures? or ?Cold Traps?). It seems that site personnel commonly assign a lower response priority to these Drainage Failures traps, and sometimes actually implement a practice to intentionally convert Leaking traps into Cold Traps by closing the inlet stop valve to immediately stop energy leakage. Subsequently, they may label those traps as ?Valved- Out? or ?Out of Service,? but those trap stations were originally designed as needed to drain retained condensate from the system. So, the correct designation for such a trap station is ?Cold,? regardless of the current intention. If the trap station does not drain condensate and is not hot, it is ?Cold. ? It can be astounding that many sites are not convinced of what actions or priority to take to repair Cold Traps, even while intrinsically understanding that {{there is something wrong with}} having Cold Traps that cannot drain condensate from a steam system. It often is simply because sites may not be fully aware of the potential dangers of uncorrected Cold Traps or the significant safety, reliability, and energy benefits of addressing them. Although safety is always the main priority, it cannot be overstated that there are huge reliability and energy benefits to prioritized repair of Cold Traps. Unfortunately, proactive response to repair Cold Traps in a steam system is not always achieved, often because the real benefits of such a response are not understood. Therefore, further review of ?WHAT TO DO ABOUT COLD TRAPS?AND WHY?? is warranted for safe, reliable, and energy-efficient management of the <b>condensate</b> <b>discharge</b> locations (CDLs). Several tables are provided to help sites valuate the cost impact of Cold Traps in their steam systems by using readily available historical data...|$|R
40|$|On December 23, 1991, the U. S. Dep of Energy, Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL) and the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) {{agreed to}} adhere to the {{provisions}} of the Department of Ecology Consent Order No. DE 9 INM- 177 (Consent Order) (Ecology and U. S. DOE 1991). The Consent Order lists the regulatory milestones for liquid effluent at the Hanford Site to comply with the permitting requirements of Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173 - 216 (State Waste Discharge Permit Program) or WAC 173 - 218 (Washington Underground Injection Control Progam) where applicable. DOE-RL provided the U. S Congress a plan and schedule to discontinue disposal of contaminated liquid effluent into the soil column on the Hanford Site (DOE 1987). The plan and schedule document contained a strategy for the implementation of alternative treatment and disposal systems. This strategy included prioritizing the into two phases. The Phase I streams were considered to be higher priority than the Phase II streams. The actions recommended for the Phase I and II streams were incorporated in the Hanford Federal Facility A and Consent Order (Tri Party Agreement) (Ecology, et al. 1994). Miscellaneous Streams are those liquid effluent identified within the Consent Order that are discharged to the ground but are not categorized as Phase I or Phase II Streams. Miscellaneous discharging to the soil column on the Hanford Site are subject to requirements of several milestones identified in the Consent Order. The Plan and Schedule for Disposition and Regulatory Compliance for Miscellaneous Streams (DOE/RL, 93 - 94) provides a plan and schedule for the disposition of Miscellaneous Streams to satisfy one of the Consent Order requirements. One of the commitments (Activity 6 - 2. 2) established in the plan and schedule is to annually update the Miscellaneous Stream Inventory. The annual update will continue until September of 1998, at which time four categorical permit applications are scheduled to have been submitted to Ecology. This document constitutes the 1996 revision of the Inventory of Miscellaneous Streanu. This inventory has been used to prepare the State Waste Discharge Permit Application for Cooling Water and <b>Condensate</b> <b>Discharges</b> (DOE/RL, 96 - 41) and the Miscellaneous Stream Best Management Practice Report (DOE/RL- 96 - 40).

The main application problems of radiant panel in summer include lower cooling capacity owing to high temperature of {{water supply and}} condensation. A new radiant panel was developed. Water duct and panel are straight forming which eliminates the thermal contact resistance. The panel are installed in an angle in order to <b>discharge</b> <b>condensate</b> water.

40|$|For maximum {{effectiveness}} in steam systems, steam traps should have operating characteristics which closely match {{the requirements of}} the applications for which they are used. A trap which holds back condensate until it is subcooled and some of the sensible heat has been utilized is unsuitable where the need is to get maximum output from an exchanger by <b>discharging</b> <b>condensate</b> as soon as it forms. Equally, a trap <b>discharging</b> <b>condensate</b> at steam temperature can exacerbate flash steam problems in cases where surplus heat exchange area exists and a subcooling trap might be more suitable. In all cases, undersized traps simply cannot drain condensate from the steam equipment at the required rate, while oversized traps which cost more will usually wear faster and begin leaking expensive steam. This emphasizes the need for carefully selecting trap sizes that are properly engineered for maximum system efficiency. And, of course, the ability of a trap to cope with varying loads and to discharge noncondensible gases is often important. The recommended procedure is to first select the trap type which has performance capabilities that satisfy specific application needs, and then to choose a size which handles the condensate load without any unnecessary excess capacity. The Selection Guide, Table 1, is not comprehensive but helps in many applications where no unusual operating conditions or severe corrosion problems exist. Choosing the correct trap size then implies estimating the steam consumption rate, which of course equals the condensate load. Sometimes the load has already been measured, or the rated output of the steam equipment is known or can be obtained from the original manufacturer. In other cases, an estimate must be made and a Table o f Load Formulas will help although it, too, cannot be comprehensive. After making the best possible estimate of the load, a safety factor is applied. This allows for any inaccuracies in the estimating, for increased condensation rates at start-up, and for lower than anticipated pressure differentials across the trap...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the energy loss through the steam trap in the steam system. In industry, steam traps {{frequently}} fail {{but they are not}} noticed except when they are leaking. If steam trap fail in failed open, live steam can escape to surrounding. High amount of energy will loss from the steam system. It takes weeks or months before it being repaired or replaced. The first objective {{of this study is to}} measure the heat loss for normal thermodynamic steam trap in respond to operating pressure for different condensate load. The second objective is to measure the heat loss for failed open thermodynamic steam trap in respond to operating pressure for different condensate load. The last objective is to compare energy loss between normal and failed open steam trap. From the last objective, the actual energy loss if failed steam trap is not repaired is determined. Thermodynamic steam trap has been tested in the experiment and the operating pressure is below 1 bar. <b>Condensate</b> that <b>discharges</b> from steam trap is collected to record the reading of its temperature and weight. These data is used to determine the energy loss through the steam trap. For normal steam trap, energy loss for high condensate load is higher than low condensate load. For failed open steam trap, energy loss for high condensate load is lower than low condensate load. Finally, after comparing the result, steam system that has low condensate load has higher energy loss compare to high condensate load...|$|R
40|$|Steam trap is {{the most}} {{important}} link in the condensate loop because it connects steam usage with condensate return. The function of steam trap is to <b>discharge</b> <b>condensate</b> while not permitting the escape of live steam. For the efficient usage of steam inside the process equipment, the steam should be kept inside the device until the complete steam is transformed into condensate. For thi s to be happen the steam trap functioning will be in perfect condition. The main objective of the study is to analyse the operating characte ristics of the presently installed steam trap and their effects on the efficiency of heat transfer in their respective process applications. From the study it may clear that trap failure may be of two-live steam to discharge and steam leak. Trap failure may also result in the water logging of heat exchangers of textile processing units. All these may results in excessive steam usage and it directly have an economy impact. This thesis work is an analytical study of steam traps to improve the steam system efficiency...|$|R
40|$|In oil {{refineries}} and petrochemical plants {{large number of}} steam traps are used to <b>discharge</b> <b>condensate</b> from steam mains, tracers and process equipment. Early efforts on steam traps focused almost exclusively on their selection and sizing, {{and it was not}} until the 1973 oil embargo that a need for regular maintenance became recognized. Although relatively small pieces of equipment, traps are responsible for large quantities of steam losses, decreased equipment efficiency and high maintenance costs; e. g., a steam trap leaking 100 psig steam through a 1 / 8 inch orifice costs at least $ 2 k/yr if steam is valued at $ 5 /k lb. Typically, a steam trap survey identifies 20 - 60 % of traps malfunctioning. Therefore, establishing an effective steam trap selection/maintenance program is not simple but can be extremely profitable. This paper will show how a successful checking/maintenance program can result in high returns by using a case study at an Exxon plant. The example also shows how a central engineering organization can interact with plant technicians/ maintenance personnel to help implement an effective steam trap maintenance program at competitive costs and high returns...|$|R
40|$|Industries {{including}} a fermentation step use {{large volumes of}} water to dilute their musts. In beet alcohol distilleries, this water is recovered as condensates during stillage concentration. Because of their high organic content, these <b>condensates</b> cannot be <b>discharged</b> without a treatment. The elimination of inhibitory solutes that they contain would enable their recycling into alcoholic fermentation. Reverse osmosis is an interesting process within this framework but membrane behavior with respect to small organic solutes is little known. A pre-selection step was necessary to choose among eight appropriate membranes (ESPA 2, LFC 3 and CPA 2 from Hydranautics, BW 30 and BW 30 LE from Filmtec, SG, SE and CE from Osmonics) the best one for this application. Their efficiency was estimated according to permeate fluxes, fermentation ability and solute concentration measurements, obtained at two pH and volume reduction factors. Permeate fluxes were high (between 35 and 120 L. m(- 2). h(- 1)). The target solutes were well rejected (between 82. 2 and 99. 2 %) and permeate inhibitory effect was weak (between 0 and 5. 2 %). According to these three criteria, ESPA 2 membrane {{appeared to be the}} most efficient, followed by CPA 2. Results were linked to membrane manufacturers' data and showed that the latter were not appropriate to differentiate membranes for this application. Permeabilities were calculated according to the solution-diffusion model and showed that transfer mechanism is different from one molecule to another...|$|R
