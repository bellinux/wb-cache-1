We quantitatively evaluate the tradeoffs in cost, performance, and reliability of these DIY-RAID systems. Our principal result is an architecture that scales from 10 s to 1000 s of disks; we demonstrate that a 1995 implementation would have much lower cost, better and more scalable performance, and roughly the same reliability as commercially available hardware RAID systems.

40|$|Abstract 1. The Advanced Light Source (ALS) [l] {{is a third}} {{generation}} 1 - 2 GeV synchrotron radiation source designed to provide arts for 60 beamlines. It uses a 50 MeV electron linac and 1. 5 F eV, 1 Hz, booster synchrotron for injection into a l- 2 GcV storage ring. Interesting control problems arc created {{because of the need}} for dynamic closed beam orbit control to eliminate interaction between the ring tuning requirements and to minimize orbit shifts due to ground vibrations. The extremely signal sensitive nature of the expcrimcnts rcquircs special attention to the sources of electrical noise. These requirements have led to a control system design which emphasizes connectivity at the accelerator equipment end and a large I/O bandwidth for closed loop system response. Not overlooked are user friendlyness, o tp crater response time, modcling, and expert system provisions. ortable consoles are used for local operation of machine equipment. Our solution is a massively parallel system with> 120 Mbits/set I/O bandwidth and> 1500 Mips computing power. At the equipment level connections are made using over 600 powerful Intelligent Local Controllcrs(ILC-s) mounted in 3 U size Eurocard slots using fiber-optic <b>cables</b> between <b>rack</b> locations. In the control room, personal computers control and display all machine variables at a 10 Hz rate including the siopk signals which are collected though the control svstem.

2500|$|The {{second of}} three spacewalks was {{completed}} on flight day 7. Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick {{were able to}} complete all their planned tasks in 5 hours and 54 minutes. The tasks included installing ammonia coolant loops, thermal blankets to protect the ammonia hoses, outfitting the earth facing port of Tranquility for the Cupola, install handrails and a non-propulsive vent valve (NPV). During the connection {{of one of the}} ammonia hoses, a small amount of ammonia leaked out of a quick disconnect valve and floated towards Nick Patrick. Procedures called for a [...] "bake-out" [...] while Patrick worked during the sunlit portion of the orbit, and a contamination test in the airlock. The bake-out happened {{at the end of the}} spacewalk. While the spacewalk was happening, Terry Virts and Kay Hire along with ISS commander Jeff Williams, Soichi Noguchi and T.J. Creamer, continued outfitting the Tranquility module. This included setting up the ventilation system, connecting electrical and computer <b>cables</b> and configuring <b>racks.</b> They confirmed lights and computers were on in the node once the ammonia cooling system had been activated. The crew also received word the mission had been extended by one day in the morning.|$|R
40|$|NASA {{recently}} assembled {{one of the}} world's fastest operational supercomputers to {{meet the}} agency's new high performance computing needs. This large-scale system, named Columbia, consists of 20 interconnected SGI Altix 512 -processor systems, {{for a total of}} 10, 240 Intel Itanium- 2 processors. High-fidelity CFD simulations were performed for the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) computer room at Ames Research Center. The purpose of the simulations was to assess the adequacy of the existing air handling and conditioning system and make recommendations for changes {{in the design of the}} system if needed. The simulations were performed with NASA's OVERFLOW- 2 CFD code which utilizes overset structured grids. A new set of boundary conditions were developed and added to the flow solver for modeling the roomls air-conditioning and proper cooling of the equipment. Boundary condition parameters for the flow solver are based on cooler CFM (flow rate) ratings and some reasonable assumptions of flow and heat transfer data for the floor and central processing units (CPU). The geometry modeling from blue prints and grid generation were handled by the NASA Ames software package Chimera Grid Tools (CGT). This geometric model was developed as a CGT-scripted template, which can be easily modified to accommodate any changes in shape and size of the room, locations and dimensions of the CPU racks, disk racks, coolers, power distribution units, and mass-storage system. The compute nodes are grouped in pairs of racks with an aisle in the middle. High-speed connection <b>cables</b> connect the <b>racks</b> with overhead <b>cable</b> trays. The cool air from the cooling units is pumped into the computer room from a sub-floor through perforated floor tiles. The CPU cooling fans draw cool air from the floor tiles, which run along the outside length of each rack, and eject warm air into the center isle between the racks. This warm air is eventually drawn into the cooling units located near the walls of the room. One major concern is that the hot air ejected to the middle isle might recirculate back into the cool rack side and cause thermal short-cycling. The simulations analyzed and addressed the following important elements of the computer room: 1) High-temperature build-up in certain regions of the room; 2) Areas of low air circulation in the room; 3) Potential short-cycling of the computer rack cooling system; 4) Effectiveness of the perforated cooling floor tiles; 5) Effect of changes in various aspects of the cooling units. Detailed flow visualization is performed to show temperature distribution, air-flow streamlines and velocities in the computer room...|$|R
