40|$|In {{the article}} are shown results of {{assessment}} {{of relationships between}} quantitative and qualitative <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> forests and morphometric <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> relief on an example model plot in Nanayskoe forest district of Khabarovsk Territory.

5|$|French {{paleontologist}} Eric Buffetaut and a Thai colleague, Varavudh Suteethorn, {{described a}} partial {{upper and lower}} jaw from the Aptian-Albian Khok Kruat Formation of Thailand in 1992, giving it the name Psittacosaurus sattayaraki. In 2000, Sereno questioned the validity of this species, citing its eroded and fragmentary nature, and noted an absence of features <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> the genus Psittacosaurus. However, in 2002 the original authors published new images of the fossil which seem to show teeth in the lower jaw that exhibit the bulbous vertical ridge <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> psittacosaurs. Other authors have also defended its validity, while some continue to regard it as dubious. Sereno (2010) proposed that the best assignment for the type material may be Ceratopsia incertae sedis.|$|E
