5|$|In {{addition}} to its applications in enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry is a fundamental tool for doing <b>calculations</b> in string theory. In the A-model of topological string theory, physically interesting quantities are {{expressed in terms of}} infinitely many numbers called Gromov–Witten invariants, which are extremely difficult to compute. In the B-model, the <b>calculations</b> can be reduced to classical integrals and are much easier. By applying mirror symmetry, theorists can translate difficult <b>calculations</b> in the A-model into equivalent but technically easier <b>calculations</b> in the B-model. These <b>calculations</b> are then used to determine the probabilities of various physical processes in string theory. Mirror symmetry can be combined with other dualities to translate <b>calculations</b> in one theory into equivalent <b>calculations</b> in a different theory. By outsourcing <b>calculations</b> to different theories in this way, theorists can calculate quantities that are impossible to calculate without the use of dualities.|$|E
5|$|Understanding data {{dependencies}} {{is fundamental}} in implementing parallel algorithms. No program can run {{more quickly than}} the longest chain of dependent <b>calculations</b> (known as the critical path), since <b>calculations</b> that depend upon prior <b>calculations</b> in the chain must be executed in order. However, most algorithms do not consist of just a long chain of dependent calculations; there are usually opportunities to execute independent <b>calculations</b> in parallel.|$|E
5|$|A {{lawrencium}} atom has 103 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. In 1970, {{it was predicted that}} the ground-state electron configuration of lawrencium was 5f146d17s2 (ground state term symbol 2D3/2), following the Aufbau principle and conforming to the 4f145d16s2 configuration of lawrencium's lighter homolog lutetium. However, the next year, <b>calculations</b> were published that questioned this prediction, instead expecting an anomalous 5f147s27p1 configuration. Though early <b>calculations</b> gave conflicting results, more recent studies and <b>calculations</b> confirm the s2p suggestion. 1974 relativistic <b>calculations</b> concluded that the energy difference between the two configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was the ground state. Later 1995 <b>calculations</b> concluded that the s2p configuration should be energetically favored, because the spherical s and p1/2 orbitals are nearest to the atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly.|$|E
