500|$|After the {{publication}} of the Guide, Evans concentrated on his work as a milling supply merchant and gaining financial security through licensing his patented designs. With enough millers now using Evans's machinery, adoption began to accelerate rapidly after 1800, as did his considerable wealth from the license fees. In these years Evans concentrated on growing his commercial operations in Philadelphia, expanding his store several times, becoming an agent for English imports, and taking on blacksmiths to complete more complicated metal work for mills. All the while Evans continued to refine various elements of mill design, including patenting a new process for making millstones and developing a screw mill for grinding plaster of Paris, which was in great demand in Philadelphia for stucco work.

50|$|Calendering is an {{operation}} {{carried out on}} a fabric to improve its aesthetics. The fabric passes {{through a series of}} calender rollers by wrapping; the face in contact with a roller alternates from one roller to the next. An ordinary calender consists of a series of hard and soft (resilient) bowls (rollers) placed in a definite order. The soft roller may be compressed with either cotton or wool-paper, linen paper or flax paper. The hard metal bowl is either of chilled iron or cast iron or steel. The calender may consist of 3, 5, 6, 7 and 10 rollers. The sequence of the rollers is that no two hard rollers are in contact with each other. Pressure may be applied by <b>compound</b> <b>levers</b> and weights, or hydraulic pressure may be used as an alternative. The pressure and heat applied in calendering depend on the type of the finish required.|$|R
40|$|Levered ETFs are {{designed}} to track a particular benchmark, but in an exaggerated fashion. For example, the Pro Shares Ultra S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 (SS 0) is a 2 X fund, meaning its performance should be twice {{the level of the}} index. However, this performance only matches short term. In particular, since volatility reduces <b>compounded</b> returns, <b>levered</b> funds 2 ̆ 2 lose 2 ̆ 2 performance through time.

50|$|The <b>compound</b> <b>lever</b> is {{a simple}} machine {{operating}} {{on the premise that}} the resistance from one lever in a system of levers will act as power for the next, and thus the applied force will be amplified from one lever to the next (as long as the mechanical advantage for each lever is greater than one).

40|$|International audienceStarting from a {{critical}} analysis of a first "proof of concept" study on {{the utility of the}} liver volatolome for detecting livestock exposure to environmental micropollutants (Berge et al., 2011), the primary aim {{of this paper is to}} improve extraction conditions so as to obtain more representative extracts by using an extraction temperature closer to livestock physiological conditions while minimizing analytical variability and maximizing Volatile Organic <b>Compound</b> (VOC) abundancies. <b>Levers</b> related to extraction conditions and sample preparation were assessed in the light of both abundance and coefficient of variation of 22 candidate VOC markers identified in earlier volatolomic studies. Starting with a CAR/PDMS fiber and a 30 min extraction, the reduction of SPME temperature to 40 °C resulted in a significant decrease in the area of 14 candidate VOC markers (p< 0. 05), mainly carbonyls and alcohols but also a reduction in the coefficient of variation for 17 of them. In order to restore VOC abundances and to minimize variability, two approaches dealing with sample preparation were investigated. By increasing sample defrosting time at 4 °C from 0 to 24 h yielded higher abundances and lower variabilities for 15 and 13 compounds, respectively. Lastly, by using additives favouring the release of VOCs (1. 2 g of NaCl) the sensitivity of the analysis was improved with a significant increase in VOC abundances of more than 50 % for 13 out of the 22 candidate markers. The modified SPME parameters significantly enhanced the abundances while decreasing the analytical variability for most candidate VOC markers. The second step was to validate the ability of the revised SPME protocol to discriminate intentionally contaminated broiler chickens from controls, under case/control animal testing conditions. After verification of the contamination levels of the animals by national reference laboratories, data analysis by a multivariate chemometric method (Common Components and Specific Weights Analysis - ComDim) showed that the liver volatolome could reveal dietary exposure of broilers to a group of environmental pollutants (PCBs), a veterinary treatment (monensin), and a pesticide (deltamethrin), thus confirming the usefulness of this analytical set-up...|$|R

50|$|The {{idea of the}} <b>compound</b> <b>lever</b> is {{attributed}} to the Birmingham inventor John Wyatt in 1743, when he designed a weighing machine that used four compound levers to transfer a load from a weighing platform to a central lever from which the weight could be measured.|$|E
5000|$|The {{figure on}} the left {{illustrates}} a <b>compound</b> <b>lever</b> formed from two first-class levers, along with a short derivation of how to compute the mechanical advantage. With the dimensions shown, the mechanical advantage, W/F can be calculated as [...] = 7.5, meaning that an applied force of 1 pound (or 1 kg) could lift a weight of 7.5 lb (or 7.5 kg).|$|E
50|$|Pipe and duct snips, {{also known}} as double cut snips, are a subtype of compound-action snip used to cut stove pipe and ducting lengthwise. The snips have a three-piece jaw that has two side blades that slide against a central blade. This creates a 11/64 in wide strip that curls up along the cut. A <b>compound</b> <b>lever</b> system is used to {{increase}} the mechanical advantage.|$|E
50|$|A piano key is a <b>compound</b> <b>lever</b> of the first-class, {{since the}} fulcrum {{is between the}} weight to be moved and the power. The purpose of this lever is to {{translate}} a small movement (depression of the key) into a larger and fast movement of the hammer on the strings. The quality of the resulting tone depends on whether the final speed is brought about by gradual or sudden movement of the key.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively, if the {{position}} of the fulcrum on lever AA' were moved so that A1 = 4 units and A2 = 9 units, then the mechanical advantage W/F is calculated as [...] = 1, meaning that an applied force will lift an equivalent weight and there is no mechanical advantage. This is not usually the goal of a <b>compound</b> <b>lever</b> system, though in rare situations the geometry may suit a specific purpose.|$|E
50|$|They {{are usually}} {{operated}} with two hands, and with handles typically between 30 cm & 91 cm long to give good leverage. Some have telescopic handles {{which can be}} extended to a length of two metres, {{in order to increase}} leverage and to reach high branches on a tree. Loppers are mainly used for the pruning of tree branches with diameters less than 5 cm. Some of the newer lopper designs have a gear or <b>compound</b> <b>lever</b> system which increases the force applied to the blades, or a ratchet drive.|$|E
50|$|A few {{examples}} of the <b>compound</b> <b>lever</b> are the scale, train brakes, and a common type of nail clippers. Another example is the elbow-joint press, which is used in printing, molding or handloading bullets, minting coins and medals, and in hole punching. Compound balances are used to weigh heavy items. These all use multiple levers to magnify force to accomplish a specific purpose. The train brake translates the force of pushing back the stick to the levers and they rub against the wheels, using friction to slow and eventually stop the train. These are everyday applications of this mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distances}} used in {{calculation of}} mechanical advantage are measured {{perpendicular to the}} force. In {{the example of a}} nail clipper on the right (a <b>compound</b> <b>lever</b> made of a class 2 and a class 3 lever), because the effort is applied vertically (that is, not perpendicular to the lever), distances to the respective fulcrums are measured horizontally, instead of along the lever. In this example, W/F is [...] = 6. Note that (7 + 1) cm = 8 cm is the distance from the point of application of the effort to the fulcrum of the first lever, perpendicular to the applied effort.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mechanical}} {{advantage of a}} simple machine like the wheel and axle is computed as {{the ratio of the}} resistance to the effort. The larger the ratio the greater the multiplication of force (torque) created or distance achieved. By varying the radii of the axle and/or wheel, any amount of {{mechanical advantage}} may be gained. [...] In this manner, the size of the wheel may be increased to an inconvenient extent. In this case a system or combination of wheels (often toothed, that is, gears) are used. As a wheel and axle is a type of lever, a system of wheels and axles is like a <b>compound</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{lever arm}} uses the [...] {{to lift the}} load using and intensifying an applied force. In practice, {{conditions}} may prevent {{the use of a}} single lever to accomplish the desired result, e.g., a restricted space, the inconvenient location of the point of delivery of the resultant force, or the prohibitive length of the lever arm needed. In these conditions, combinations of simple levers, called compound levers, are used. Compound levers can be constructed from first, second and/or third-order levers. In all types of <b>compound</b> <b>lever,</b> the rule is that force multiplied by the force arm equals the weight multiplied by the weight arm. The output from one lever becomes the input for the next lever in the system, and so the advantage is magnified.|$|E

50|$|Nail {{clippers}} {{are usually}} made {{of stainless steel}} but can also be made of plastic and aluminium. Two common varieties are the plier type and the <b>compound</b> <b>lever</b> type. Most nail clippers usually come with another tool attached, {{which is used to}} clean dirt out from under nails. A nail clipper often has a miniature file fixed to it to allow rough edges of nails to be manicured. A nail file allows for removal of any excess nail that is jagged or has been missed. Nail clippers occasionally come with a pocket knife or a nail catcher; the multi-purpose nail clipper was invented by Hungarian inventor David Gestetner. The nail clipper consists of a head which may be concave or convex. Specialized nail clippers which have convex clipping ends are intended for trimming toenails, while concave clipping ends are for fingernails. The cutting head may be manufactured to be parallel or perpendicular to the principal axis of the cutter. Cutting heads which are parallel to the principal axis are made to address accessibility issues involved with cutting toenails.|$|E

40|$|The cranial {{osteology}} of C. venustus, L. dimidiatus and S. fasciatus is described. C. venustus and L. dimidiatus possess three features {{characteristic of}} the family Labridae: protrusible upper jaws, the ascending process of the maxilla longer than the alveolar process, and the alveolar process of the premaxilla attached by fibrous tissue to the distal end of the maxilla {{which in turn is}} fastened to the ascending process of the dentary. The neurocranium of C. venustus shows several features involved in strengthening the skull to withstand the strong forces applied during feeding when crushing molluscs, barnacles and crabs as well as turning over slabs of coral. The forward movement of jaws and eyes have permitted L. dimidiatus to feed by picking small organisms off the general body surface, pharynx, gills and buccal cavity of host fish. S. fasciatus has at least three features characteristic of scarids: fused teeth on the premaxillae and dentary, a premaxilla firmly attached to the maxilla, and a secondary joint between the dentary and articular producing a <b>compound</b> <b>lever</b> type of articulation for the lower jaw. Several modifications help strengthen the upper and lower jaws and enable S. fasciatus to feed by scraping pieces of algae and coral fragments from the surfaces of coral rocks...|$|E
