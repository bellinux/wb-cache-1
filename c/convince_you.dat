Ingalls, however, congratulated it for being a [...] "well-produced pop/dance song". Adam Kivel of Consequence of Sound found the track to [...] "lack an identifiable tone or feeling", but felt its overall sound was [...] "effortless".

2500|$|He appeared, from 1984 until 1989, {{with the}} New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players (NYGASP), earning warm reviews for his [...] "subtle facial gesture and small comic touch" [...] and clear diction. [...] Of his 1986 Bunthorne with the company, The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Reed does not overdo. He sings and {{speaks in a}} {{moderate}} tone of voice, never moves more than fairly quickly, and never hits the audience {{over the head with}} a joke. As a result, when he strikes a pose of even mild ridiculousness, the result is hilarity. He makes Bunthorne a good-natured poseur, and admits his dependency on adulation with endearing simplicity." [...] At a NYGASP gala at Symphony Space in 1987, Reed proposed on stage to noted sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer. [...] He also performed in concerts in North America and Britain, including at The Berkshire Choral Institute as The Duke of Plaza Toro (with Kenneth Sandford as Don Alhambra) in The Gondoliers (1985). [...] In reviewing a 1988 concert, The Boston Globe wrote that Reed [...] "is near to perfect in his chosen field. Reed's acting, his command of patter and everything he does (which is a lot) to <b>convince</b> <b>you</b> that what he's emitting could really be mellifluous, all-out singing – all these are freshly and tirelessly amusing".|$|E
2500|$|David Browne {{reviewed}} the album for Entertainment Weekly and awarded it a [...] "B" [...] rating, calling Enya [...] "even less {{the life of}} the pub" [...] with her new release. [...] "With its layered, breathing-lesson choral harmonies cushioned in sullen keyboards, the album is, except for a few perky moments, wistful to the point of stultification. A gorgeous formula, but perhaps even Enya could use a good stiff belt." [...] The Los Angeles Times issued a three stars out of four rating in a review by Don Heckman. He wrote that Enya remains in her [...] "musical trance ... on an ethereal plateau of her own", which he recognises as a good thing for her fans. The [...] "technical proficiency and the mood-sustaining qualities" [...] of the music, that Heckman called [...] "mysterious" [...] and [...] "rich" [...] coupled with Enya's [...] "angelic, folk soprano" [...] and [...] "nostalgic" [...] piano, flow to make a seamless album that [...] "almost demands that the album be heard in its entirety". Heckman praised Enya for the [...] "remarkable" [...] feat of being the album's sole musician, and concluded with: [...] "If anything can restore the tarnished image of New Age music, this may be it". Rolling Stone magazine reporter Elysa Gardner gave the album three stars out of four. She wrote: [...] "Because Enya's lush, synthladen arrangements rarely come off as bloated or banal, her work typically inspires less ridicule than, say, Yanni's". Gardner picked out [...] "China Roses" [...] as a track that reminded her of the [...] "tranquil radiance" [...] of [...] "Caribbean Blue" [...] from Shepherd Moons, with [...] "Once You Had Gold" [...] sounding [...] "equally tender, with a reassuring lyric and all the prettiness of a Christmas carol". She continued: [...] "Regardless of whether you understand Latin or Gaelic, the atmospheric warmth of [...] "Pax Deorum" [...] and [...] "Athair Ar Neamh" [...] will temporarily <b>convince</b> <b>you</b> that the world isn't such a terrible place after all". The album received a more critical review from Howard Cohen for The Los Angeles Daily News, saying it does not [...] "disappoint, at least not stylistically" [...] with its [...] "flawless" [...] recording and [...] "gorgeous" [...] sounds, but goes on to write, [...] "She stalls ... drowning in her formula. Two stars".|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "Ori" [...] {{comes from}} the word [...] "Origin", as in {{the origin of the}} Ancients. When {{executive}} producer Robert C. Cooper looked at the root of [...] "origin", he retcon-invented the word [...] "Origin" [...] as the name of the Ori religion. Cooper said it was an interesting idea for him to address the philosophical arguments with various religious people, seeing the whole challenge as [...] "how do you prove whose God exists or whether God exists at all?" [...] Instead of the Goa'uld, who were proved quickly to not be gods by killing them and figuring out their technology, {{it would be hard to}} present the same argument to the Ori followers because the Ori were essentially ascended gods. Even if their gods were dead, it would not make much difference for them, as their followers would continue to believe; without the [...] "magic powers" [...] of the Ori, their followers and the Priors (the Ori's missionaries) could still use the technology and their ships. Cooper said that [...] "it's not necessarily wrong to believe in something ... what's wrong is to murder somebody because they don't believe the way you do." [...] Although Cooper was reluctant to get too serious about the meaning behind the Ori as Stargate should [...] "first and foremost [...] entertain people", he considered it representative of television and the media, [...] "mak people believe whatever the people in charge of that magic box [...] whatever they want you to believe they can pretty much <b>convince</b> <b>you,</b> or convince the vast majority of people." [...] For Cooper, [...] "the followers of the Ori were the interesting part", and he [...] "wanted to do a story that was in some way reflective of the differences between people's beliefs that we see around us in our society, and how conflicts arise as a result of that." [...] Cooper was particularly interested in the interaction between Ori followers and other normal human beings, the resulting [...] "mysterious aspect and quality to religious belief and the passion that it invokes." [...] The producers therefore put the Ori in the story background, similar to the way there was very little direct interaction between the actual deities of the religion and mankind in real life.|$|E
2500|$|King {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, based on 18 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". About.com gave it {{four out of}} five stars, stating [...] "with his swagger-jacking charm on the microphone, and enough charisma to <b>convince</b> <b>you</b> that he's really running things in his department, he just might be the Jay-Z of the south. King is not only T.I.'s most captivating album so far, it's probably the best thing {{to come out of the}} [...] "A-Town" [...] lately. And, as Pimp C explains on one of the album's many skits, a [...] "king" [...] is anyone that handles his business appropriately on the lyrical side of things, and many kings abound in southern rap. With such foraying display of bravado, T.I. has rightfully earned his membership to hip-hop's elite. Royal salute!" [...] Allmusic writer Andy Kellman gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 praising the album's lead single [...] "What You Know", and stating [...] "T.I.'s fourth album isn't the leap forward he's been threatening to make, but it does carry the best set of productions he has been given to work with, and it guarantees that he won't be leaving the singles charts any time soon." [...] Blender Magazine noted on T.I.'s status saying [...] "Before his album sold a surprise half a million copies in its first week of release, T.I. was a Southern star who didn’t quite feel like one: He made up with irresistible hooks what he lacked in personality. Now he’s a national star who doesn’t quite feel like one. A breezily charismatic drug rapper, he’s like Jay-Z without the worldview, Young Jeezy without the gravitas; he still hasn’t distinguished himself as an artist worth exploring past the singles. Thankfully, he’s packed album No. 4 full of singles, which might be just as good. His sonorous, self-assured drawl adds an air of unflustered authority to his alpha brags, and he pours it into unexpected patterns. What he’s best at is craft—woozy refrains and hypnotic rhyme schemes—and his fleet of beats is impeccable, highlighted by the four-minute epic “What You Know,” which laces imperious synths with an intriguing wistfulness. Throughout, producers Just Blaze, Swizz Beatz and DJ Toomp back T.I.’s self-deifying spiels with wild bombast: he’d seem a lot less kingly if it weren’t for his court." ...|$|E
