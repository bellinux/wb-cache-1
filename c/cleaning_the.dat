5|$|Bubbles is an arcade {{video game}} {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1982. The player uses a joystick {{to control a}} bubble in a kitchen sink. The object is to progress through levels by <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> sink while avoiding enemies. The game received a mixed reception from critics.|$|E
5|$|Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now {{an escaped}} {{political}} prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left {{a key to the}} chapel hidden {{at the feet of the}} statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins <b>cleaning.</b> <b>The</b> Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} budget, the {{restoration}} had been primarily focused on <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> sculptures, and Van Erp did not solve the drainage problem. Within fifteen years, the gallery walls were sagging, and the reliefs showed signs of new cracks and deterioration. Van Erp used concrete from which alkali salts and calcium hydroxide leached and were transported {{into the rest of}} the construction. This caused some problems, so that a further thorough renovation was urgently needed.|$|E
50|$|Generally for <b>cleaning</b> pigs, <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> force applied is the {{mechanical}} force between the pipe inner wall and <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> pig itself. This force {{is determined by}} the pig travel speed {{as well as by the}} hardness and shape of <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> edge: <b>The</b> faster the pig, <b>the</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> impact on <b>the</b> deposits, but at the same time only the surface of the debris is scratched away. Therefore several, sometimes many, pig runs are required to clean a pipeline.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This article {{presents}} how {{can be determined}} <b>the</b> degree of <b>cleaning</b> of <b>the</b> microelectronic parts. <b>The</b> <b>cleaning</b> degree ofthe parts depends on: temperature of <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> environment, <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> liquid nature, cleaning liquid viscosity, time of <b>cleaning.</b> Firstly <b>the</b> choice of <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> environments depends {{on the type of}} contaminant needed to be removed from the cleansed object, respectively on the chemical substance that can attack these contaminants. <b>The</b> degree of <b>cleaning</b> can be determined using two methods, in parallel, respectively: the method of mass loss and the method of microscopy...|$|R

Ozu, a tenant, shares Paloma's fascination with Renée's masked intelligence and brings {{her out of her}} shell (and also happens to set the entire book in forward motion), while Manuela is responsible for <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> apartments' toilets and is Renée's only real friend.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters {{spend much}} of their time grooming, which {{consists}} of <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.|$|E
40|$|Fouling layers on hot {{surfaces}} in food processing lines have frequently to be cleaned. Up to now, an inline monitoring of <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> process does not exist. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> {{is based on}} empirical knowledge and occasional optical inspections. The article presents a planar capacitive sensor together with an impedance spectroscopic measurement method and a multivariate signal evaluation to monitor <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> process. <b>The</b> result of the signal evaluation is a numerical cleaning indicator, which shows the progress of <b>the</b> <b>cleaning.</b> A steady state of <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> indicator signals <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> proc-ess. First results, obtained in a laboratory model of a heat exchanger, were presented. A reduction of <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> time in industrial plants up to 50 % is expected...|$|R

5|$|There {{are also}} {{a number of small}} items of {{uncertain}} function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and three have empty sockets at one end, which probably contained organic material such as bristle, to make a brush.

5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} {{is known}} from several groups of animals {{both in the}} sea and on land (see table). Cleaners include fish, shrimps and birds; clients include a much wider range of fish, marine reptiles including turtles and iguanas, octopus, whales, and terrestrial mammals. Cleaning symbioses with reptile clients include fish <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> teeth of American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus), geckos eating mosquitoes on Aldabra giant tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) and scarlet crabs (Grapsus grapsus), and three species of Galapagos finches removing ticks from marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus).|$|E

5|$|In some {{parenting}} species, young from {{a previous}} spawning batch may stay with their parents and help care for the new young. This is known to occur in around 19 species of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika. These helpers take part in cleaning and fanning eggs and larvae, <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> breeding hole and protecting the territory. They have reduced growth rate but gain protection from predators. Brood parasitism also exists among teleosts; minnows may spawn in sunfish nests as well as nests of other minnow species. The cuckoo catfish is known for laying eggs on the substrate as mouthbrooding cichclids collect theirs and the young catfish will eat the cichlid larvae. Filial cannibalism occurs in some teleost families and may have evolved to combat starvation.|$|E
5|$|JAL Express (JEX) was {{established}} on April 1, 1997, as a wholly owned domestic subsidiary airline of Japan Airlines (JAL), {{with an initial}} capital of ¥5.8 million. The airline operates scheduled passenger services to regional domestic destinations in Japan, {{as well as some}} low-demand flights for JAL under wet-lease agreement. It was anticipated that the airline may enter services on the domestic trunk and short-haul international routes. On July 1, 1998, JAL Express commenced operations from Osaka to Miyazaki and Kagoshima with two Boeing 737-400s, non-Japanese cockpit crew, and short-term contracted cabin attendants. The airline's cabin attendants are called Sky Cast, their duties include <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> 150-seat cabin between flights.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{all work}} units were {{continuously}} beaten by {{the guards and}} often shot or hanged at the gallows. Only the strongest men were selected from new arrivals daily to obtain the necessary replacements. There were other work details which had no contact with the transports: the Holzfällerkommando ("woodcutter unit") cut and chopped firewood, and the Tarnungskommando ("disguise unit") camouflaged the structures of the camp. Another work detail was responsible for <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> common areas. The Camp 1 Wohnlager residential compound contained barracks for about 700 Sonderkommandos which, when combined with the 300 Totenjuden living across from the gas chambers, brought their grand total to roughly one thousand at a time.|$|E

5|$|The thorax {{has three}} segments, {{each with a}} pair of robust legs, and a pair of {{membranous}} wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> antennae, and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets, flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are synchronised in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing. The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into the sting.|$|E
5|$|Those {{tending the}} {{furnaces}} were {{unaware that the}} heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started a chimney fire. With the doors of the furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven further up the flues than they should have been. The flues had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child chimney sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the <b>cleaning,</b> <b>the</b> fabric of the chimney was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of clinker had built up inside the flues.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failure}} of UNOSOM in 1991-2, the US led a {{multinational}} mission—UNITAF—which included military forces to ensure aid was distributed to Somalis. The US military entered Mogadishu on December 9, 1992, and moved to quickly secure the abandoned embassy, along with the airport and port. The following day, key military staff moved into the embassy to establish headquarters for the UNITAF mission, with the main headquarters located within the chancery. The embassy complex itself was in disrepair; buildings had been stripped bare, a foot (0.3m) of debris and trash covered the floors of the chancery, and bodies were found in some areas on the premises. Personnel promptly set out <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> compound's living spaces and work areas {{to make room for}} the arrival and assembly area. Old warehouses were razed, and new barracks, heads and galleys were erected in their place. US Navy support elements that arrived later also imported extra materials.|$|E
5|$|As silk was {{a luxury}} good, {{the market was}} small and easily {{saturated}} by machine produced goods. The next innovation in machine produced textiles came in the cotton industry which had a much wider market and produced more affordable goods. Spinning cotton was a more complex process than silk production. The water frame for spinning cotton was developed by Richard Arkwright and patented in 1769. The machines could spin yarn continuously and replaced skilled workers with unskilled supervisors {{to make sure the}} machines didn't break. Water frames varied in size from 4 to 96spindles. For these reasons, the water frame became popular and widespread. In 1771, Richard Arkwright took a lease on land in Cromford. By 1774, his first mill was operational, and in 1776 he began construction of a second mill at Cromford. During this time, he developed machines for pre-spinning and in 1775 took out his second patent. With spinning mechanised, the other processes involved in producing cotton could not keep up and also required mechanisation. He produced a machine for carding, the process which laid out the cotton fibres parallel, however not all his inventions were successful and <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> cotton was performed by hand until the 1790s when an effective machine was invented.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{can damage}} {{vegetation}} that grows on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other porous rock types, and the scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|E
30|$|Agar gels {{proved to}} be {{effective}} for <b>the</b> <b>cleaning</b> of <b>the</b> deposits on the marble substrate.
