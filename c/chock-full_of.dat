500|$|The year 1993 saw the {{formation}} of Melechesh in Jerusalem, [...] "undoubtedly the first overtly anti-Christian band to exist {{in one of the}} holiest cities in the world." [...] Melechesh began as a straightforward black metal act with their first foray into folk metal occurring on the title track of their 1996 EP The Siege of Lachish. Their subsequent albums saw the group straddling the boundaries between black, death, and thrash metal, with [...] "impressive, tastefully rendered epics <b>chock-full</b> <b>of</b> superb riffs, Middle Eastern melodies, and vocal exchanges varying from a throaty midrange screech to chanting." [...] Other oriental metal acts emerged thereafter with the band Distorted notably forming in 1996 as the first female-fronted metal act from Israel.|$|E
500|$|... "Die Hand Die Verletzt" [...] {{received}} early {{praise from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Die Hand Die Verletzt" [...] an [...] "A–", noting that, in the episode, [...] "Mulder and Scully largely step aside in this wacky, wicked effort <b>chock-full</b> <b>of</b> stunning imagery and wry comment." [...] The magazine praised Blommaert's acting, calling her [...] "juicily diabolical". Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping, {{in their book}} X-Treme Possibilities, gave the episode mostly positive reviews, although they criticized the ending. Day applauded the episode's themes of [...] "loss of faith … ritual abuse [...] repressed memories", along with the [...] "great set pieces", and the plot twists. However, he was slightly critical that the episode {{did not have a}} solid conclusion, and that the identity of Mrs. Paddock was never revealed. Cornell was even more critical about the lack of closure, calling it [...] "a vast unanswered question" [...] and [...] "very troubling in a show that's concerned with seeing the truth". However, he too was also complimentary towards the set pieces, calling them [...] "groovy".|$|E
500|$|The British premiere at the 1988 Edinburgh Festival brought {{critical}} praise: [...] "Through its sheer cleverness, wit, lyrical {{beauty and}} sense of theater, it sweeps aside most of the criticism to which it lays itself open." [...] When the work was finally performed in London, 13 years after its Houston premiere and after {{a long period of}} theatrical neglect, Tempos critic Robert Stein responded to ENO's 2000 production enthusiastically. He particularly praised the performance of Maddalena, and concluded that [...] "Adams's triumph... consists really in taking a plot <b>chock-full</b> <b>of</b> talk and public gesture, and through musical characterisation... making a satisfying and engaging piece." [...] Of the ENO revival in 2006, Erica Jeal of The Guardian wrote that [...] "from its early visual coup {{with the arrival of the}} plane, Sellars' production is an all-too-welcome reminder of his best form". In Jeal's view, the cast met admirably the challenge of presenting the work in a non-satirical spirit. Reviewing the 2008 Portland Opera production (the basis of the 2011 Canadian Opera Company presentation in Toronto), critic Patrick J. Smith concluded that [...] "Nixon in China is a great American Opera. I suspected that it was a significant work when I saw it in 1987; I was ever more convinced of its stature when I heard it subsequently, on stage and on disc, and today I am certain that it is one of the small handful of operas that will survive." ...|$|E
5000|$|Overexposed is a pop and pop rock {{album with}} dance-pop, disco, electropop, R&B and reggae influences. According to the band's {{official}} website, {{the album is}} [...] "a <b>chock-full</b> collection <b>of</b> undeniable, anthemic melodies." [...] Multiple critics stated that [...] "Moves Like Jagger" [...] served as the biggest influence for composing and writing most songs on Overexposed. Additionally, they noted that the works by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna influenced the album's sound.|$|R
500|$|... "Jury Duty" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and was considered}} by many critics {{to be a major}} {{step in the right direction}} for the series. Brian Marder from the New York Post wrote that, [...] " [...] was a step, if not a leap, in the right direction for the showwhich, let's be honest, is showing its fatigue and staleness; possibly nearing its end; clearly suffering without Steve Carell." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times gave the episode a positive review, calling the episode [...] "fun and surprisingly sweet." [...] McQuinn enjoyed the episode's developments, most notably the idea that both Jim and Dwight can bond as fathers and explained that he hoped the producers would not [...] "forget about it like almost every other development this season." [...] New York writer Michael Tedder complimented the writers for improving on the first half of the season and wrote that the episode felt more [...] "tightly written". He also complimented Krasinski's [...] "understated" [...] performance as well as Wilson's acting, citing the scene near the end of the episode wherein Dwight learns Angela's baby might be his. Despite this, he criticized the cold opening and the [...] "miming chill pill" [...] scene. Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar gave the episode a glowing review, saying, [...] "After a solid cold opening of Andy dancing ..., the rest of this week's episode of The Office is a success. ... This is one of my favorite episodes I can remember in a long time. Not too plot driven and <b>chock-full</b> <b>of</b> solid comedic writing plus a handful endearing moments that just made me feel good. To get a few of my favorite lines, just keep reading." ...|$|E

6000|$|It only {{remains to}} say that the smile (my smile) would have been at the expense of some modern editors of the famous Letters, rather than at that of my interlocutor. They are {{astonished}} at Gilbert White's vitality, and cannot find a reason for it. Why does this [...] "little cockle-shell of a book," [...] as one of them has lately called it, come gaily down to us over a sea full of waves, where so many brave barks have foundered? The style is sweet and clear, but a book cannot live merely because it is well written. It is <b>chock-full</b> <b>of</b> facts; but the facts have been tested and sifted, and all that were worth keeping are to be found incorporated in scores of standard works on natural history. I would humbly suggest that there is no mystery at all about it; that the personality of the author is the principal charm of the Letters, for in spite of his modesty and extreme reticence his spirit shines in every page; that the world will not willingly let this small book die, not only because it is small, and well written, and full of interesting matter, but chiefly because it is a very delightful human document.|$|E

Gazing down upon them from a bridge at the Junction, {{it was as if the}} concentrating Companies formed a great Industrial Exhibition of the works of {{extraordinary}} ground spiders that spun iron. And then so many of the Lines went such wonderful ways, so crossing and curving among one another, that the eye lost them. And then some of them appeared to start with the fixed intention of going five hundred miles, and all of a sudden gave it up at an insignificant barrier, or turned off into a workshop. And then others, like intoxicated men, went a little way very straight, and surprisingly slued round and came back again. And then others were so <b>chock-full</b> <b>of</b> trucks of coal, others were so blocked with trucks of casks, others were so gorged with trucks of ballast, others were so set apart for wheeled objects like immense iron cotton-reels: while others were so bright and clear, and others were so delivered over to rust and ashes and idle wheelbarrows out of work, with their legs in the air (looking much like their masters on strike), that there was no beginning, middle, or end to the bewilderment.|$|E

If he was he would never stir out after sunset, but instead of that he is out night after night on the cliffs, when there is any talk of a cargo being run. He is known to carry pistols about with him, and so though his life has been {{threatened}} many times, nothing has ever come of it. One thing is, he has got a big black horse, about the best horse there is {{in this part of the}} country, and he always rides mighty fast down into the town or up on to the cliffs, where he gets among the revenue men, and in course he is safe enough. He was down with that lot at Lulworth that night, {{and they say}} he cussed and swore loud enough to be heard all over the village, when they found that they had got there too late.

The girls'd like to put it down to your mother and me, but I don't believe it. I'm ashamed to say it, but I'm afraid it's the girls themselves. There's something not right about them, but I'm blessed if I know what it is. Their mother and I are a bit vulgar, I know, but I've done my best to copy those {{who know how to}} behave--and I believe we'd get through for what we are anywhere without giving offence. But my girls oughtn't to be vulgar. It's education as does away with that, and I've filled em <b>chock-full</b> <b>of</b> education from the time they were babies. It's run out of them, Mary, like the sands through an hour-glass. They can speak correctly, and I dare say they know all the small society tricks. But that isn't everything. They don't know how to dress. They can spend just as much as they like, and then you can come into the room in a black gown as you made yourself, and you look a lady, and they don't. That's the long and short of it. The only decent people who come to this house are your friends, and they come to see you. There's young Brooks, now. I've no son, Mary, and I'm fond of young men. I never knew one I liked as I like him. My daughters are old enough to be married, and I'd give fifty thousand pounds to have him for a son-in-law. And, of course, he won't look at 'em. He sees it. He'll talk to you. He takes no more notice of them than is civil. They fuss round him, and all that, but they might save themselves the pains. It's hard lines, Mary. I'm making money as no one knows on. I could live at Enton and afford it. But what's the good of it? If people don't care to know us here, they won't anywhere. Mary, how was it education didn't work with them girls? Your mother was my own sister, and she married a gentleman. He was a blackguard, but hang it, Mary, if I were you I'd sooner be penniless and as you are than be my daughters with five thousand apiece." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{send you}} to-day by book-post, registered, a little volume of tales which I lately put forth--most of which however {{you may have}} seen in magazines. Please accept at any rate the modest offering. Accept, too, my thanks for your sweet and dateless letter which I {{received}} a month ago--the one in which you speak with such charming appreciation and felicity of Paul Bourget. I echo your admiration--I think the Italian book one of the most exquisite things of our time. I am in only very occasional correspondence with him--and have not written since I heard from you; but I shall have an early chance, now probably, to repeat your words to him, and they will touch him in a tender place. He is living much, now, in Italy, and I may go there for May or June--though indeed I fear it is little probable. Colvin tells me of the volume of some of your inédites beauties that is on the point of appearing, and the news is a bright spot in a vulgar world. The vulgarity of literature in these islands at the present time is not to be said, and I shall clutch at you as one turns one's ear to music in the clatter of the market-place. Yet, paradoxical as it may appear, oh Louis, I have still had the refinement not to read the Wrecker in the periodical page. This is an enlightened and judicious heroism, and I do as I would be done by. Trust me, however, to taste you in long draughts as soon as I can hold the book. Then will I write to you again. You tell me nothing of yourself--so I have nothing to take up or take hold of, save indeed the cherished superstition that you enjoy some measure of health and cheer. You are, however, too far away for my imagination, and were it not for dear Colvin's friendly magic, which puts in a pin here and there, I shouldn't be able to catch and arrest at all the opaline iridescence of your legend. Yet even when he speaks of intending wars and the clash of arms, it all passes over me like an old-time song. You see how much I need you close at hand to stand successfully on the tiptoe of emulation. You fatigue, in short, my credulity, though not my affection. We lately clubbed together, all, to despatch to you an eye-witness in the person of the genius or the genus, in himself, Rudyard, for the concussion of whose extraordinary personality with your own we are beginning soon to strain the listening ear. We devoutly hope that this time he will really be washed upon your shore. With him goes a new little wife--whose brother--Wolcott Balestier, lately dead, in much youthful promise and performance (I don't allude, in saying that, especially to the literary part of it,) was a very valued young friend of mine.... The main thing that has lately happened to myself is the death of my dear sister a fortnight ago--after years of suffering, which, however, had not made her any less rare and remarkable a person or diminished the effect of the event (when it should occur) in making an extreme difference in my life. Of my occupation what shall I tell you? I have of late years left London less and less--but I am thinking sooner or later (in a near present) of making a long foreign, though not distant, absence. I am busy with the short--I have forsworn the long. I hammer at the horrid little theatrical problem, with delays and intermissions, but, horrible to relate, no failure of purpose. I shall soon publish another small story-book which I will incontinently send you. I have done many brief fictions within the last year....
