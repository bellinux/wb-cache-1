To clarify the <b>climatological</b> <b>factor</b> causing the summer FF declining trend at Kushiro, atmospheric vertical conditions in the planetary boundary layer and large-scale circulation are examined during 1989 - 2009 and 1958 - 2002, respectively, using available datasets. Composite analyses that are based on radiosonde observations reveal that the shallow fog layer is covered with a strong inversion layer during fog days whereas the inversion layer is absent during nonfog days. Composite circulation anomalies for the low-FF years at Kushiro show an intensified Okhotsk high (OH) pressure feature and southward shrinking of the North Pacific high (NPH) in July, in addition to the eastward displacement or shrinking of the NPH in August. These anomalous synoptic circulation patterns cause weakening in the southerly-southeasterly wind, which reduces sea-fog advection toward Kushiro and prevents the formation of stable stratification over the sea-fog layer. The authors suggest that the interannual variation in summer FF with the recent accelerated decline at Kushiro is primarily controlled by changes in the synoptic circulation associated with the OH and NPH development...|$|E
40|$|Present {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine optimal amounts of irrigation water for rice in different nitrogen application rates, flowering stage air temperatures, T f and plant populations. The results indicated that in water limiting conditions in the study area, the optimum irrigation water was affected by crop management (N application rate and plant population) and climatological factors such as T f. The optimum amounts of water, w w decreased at a higher rate (from 1988 to 1226 mm) by increase in nitrogen application rate (from 0 to 150 kg N ha - 1) at higher T f and plant population. These values were 2692 to 2191 mm of water for 0 to 150 kg N ha - 1 for low value of T f and plant population. Under unfavorable air temperature condition and low plant population, the w w decreased by 19 % at 150 kg N ha - 1, compared with 0 kg N ha - 1. However, under favorable air temperature condition and high plant population, this value was 38 %. Therefore, under water limiting conditions in the study area, the higher plant population and favorable <b>climatological</b> <b>factor</b> can highly reduce the optimum irrigation water at higher N application rate. Also, N application rate, plant population, P, air temperature at the flowering stage and applied irrigation water affected the net income. The maximum net income was obtained in T f = 28. 2 °C (near optimum air temperature during the flowering stage, 30 - 33 °C), P = 25 hills m - 2, 120 kg ha - 1 N application and 2138 mm applied irrigation water. The field management factors such as applied irrigation water, nitrogen application rate and plant population can be controlled by field manager and the optimum amounts may be applied. However, the climatological factors are unpredictable, therefore, these factors should be considered in economic analysis of crop yield production and field management...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPan {{evaporation}} is {{an effective}} way to analyze the multidimensional impact of climate change on irrigation water requirement since pan evaporation measures the integrated effect of radiation, wind, temperature and humidity on the evaporation from an open-water surface. The characteristic trends of pan evaporation and related <b>climatological</b> <b>factors,</b> as developed in this paper, indicate that most of the regions of Bangladesh have undergone a significant amount of decrease in evaporation through the years. The reduction in sunshine duration as a consequent of climate change can be attributed to be the principal reason for the decrease in evaporation. The spatial distribution of seasonal variation of pan evaporation along with solar radiation and humidity was analyzed, and solar radiation seemed to have the major influence on evaporation. The study also reveals that summer and spring are the seasons of highest evaporation in most of the regions.

The {{record of}} {{tropical}} circulation systems (TCS) affecting the Chesapeake Bay Region (CBR) extends {{back into the}} 16 th century, with a more detailed record beginning in 1950 that includes damage estimates for each storm. Between 1950 and 2006, the CBR accrued a total of $ 4, 158, 431, 635 ($ 14, 642, 055, 086 in 2011 USD equivalency) in damages resulting from TCSs. This region is ecologically sensitive but also sensitive {{in terms of the}} built environment and the damages that result from passing TCSs. A climatology of TCSs affecting the region is constructed providing information on the origin, path, intensity, and seasonality and each with a series of sub-types. The damage types defined in the TCS climatology include flooding, high winds, storm surge, and other (which includes any complicating factors such as tornadoes). Using the data collected between 1950 and 2006, a damage database is created to classify and quantify the <b>climatological</b> <b>factors</b> and damage types resulting from each storm. From this database, the costs associated with specific <b>climatological</b> <b>factors</b> and each damage type is determined. Of the <b>climatological</b> <b>factors,</b> the damage results vary greatly between the total cost of each sub-type and the cost per event for each sub-type. Using category as an example, the highest total cost is accrued by tropical storms ($ 2, 565, 954, 210), whereas; the most costly per category cost is for category 1 TCSs ($ 202, 631, 100). While this study did not find a significant trend in damage amounts over time, the most costly of the damage types is flooding, causing a total of $ 2, 889, 944, 884 ($ 11, 535, 539, 477 in 2011 USD equivalency). The results provide a generalized representation of the effects and damages for this region, and will allow proper preparation and mitigation for tropical circulation systems.

Several significant results emerged from the analysis, including the development of the NW flow corridor as the dominant derecho activity region in the climatology.

Evidence further suggests that <b>climatological</b> <b>factors</b> strongly control the distribution of derechos.

Normalisation provides {{an estimate of the}} losses that would occur if the floods from the past take place under current societal conditions. Economic losses from floods are the result of both societal and <b>climatological</b> <b>factors.</b> Failing to adjust for time-variant socio-economic factors produces loss amounts that are not directly comparable over time, but rather show an ever-growing trend for purely socio-economic reasons. This study has used available information on flood losses from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and the Natural Hazards Assessment Network (NATHAN). Following the conceptual approach of previous studies, we normalised flood losses by considering the effects of changes in population, wealth, and inflation at the country level. Furthermore, we removed inter-country price differences by adjusting the losses for purchasing power parities (PPP). We assessed normalised flood losses in 31 European countries. These include the member states of the European Union...|$|R
