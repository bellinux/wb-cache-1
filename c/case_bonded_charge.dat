50|$|More specifically, it is a non-recourse {{purchase}} of an assignment {{interest in a}} legal cause of action. A <b>case</b> <b>bond</b> provides a litigant with money prior to a monetary recovery. In return, the <b>case</b> <b>bond</b> accrues fees {{until there is a}} recovery which triggers the satisfaction of the assignment interest. If there is no recovery in the underlying claim or lawsuit the <b>case</b> <b>bond</b> self terminates and the obligation to satisfy its terms expire. Typically, <b>case</b> <b>bonds</b> are used by litigants to cover the costs of daily living expenses, medical bills and litigation costs.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the present}} system of <b>case</b> <b>bonds,</b> {{there is a lack}} of [...] "urgency" [...] for the {{plaintiff}} to settle out of court for lower amounts than those they would owe based on the amount of the <b>case</b> <b>bond</b> already in force. For example: if a plaintiff were required to pay $10,000 to the <b>case</b> <b>bond</b> investor based on the contractual <b>case</b> <b>bond</b> amount, settling for less than $10,000 would not be possible. This creates a problem for the defendant and possibly even for the plaintiff's attorney if they are considering settling for a lower amount. So, the purpose of the <b>case</b> <b>bond</b> is to reduce the [...] "urgency" [...] or [...] "need" [...] of the plaintiff to settle for a lower amount.|$|R

40|$|Our {{previously}} developed polarizable electrostatic {{model is}} applied to isolated N-methylacetamide (NMA) and to three hydrogen-bonded configurations of the NMA dimer. Two versions of the model are studied. In the first one (POL 1), polarizability along the valence bonds is described by induced <b>bond</b> <b>charge</b> increments, and polarizability perpendicular to the bonds is described by cylindrically isotropic induced atomic dipoles. In the other version (POL 2), the induced <b>bond</b> <b>charge</b> increments are replaced by induced atomic dipoles along the bonds. The parameterization is done by fitting to ab initio MP 2 / 6 - 31 ++G(d,p) electric potentials. The polarizability parameters are determined by subjecting the NMA molecule to various external electric fields. POL 1 {{turns out to be}} easier to optimize than POL 2. Both models reproduce well the ab initio electric potentials, molecular dipole moments, and molecular polarizability tensors of the monomer and the dimers. Nonpolarizable models are also investigated. The results show that polarization is very important for reproducing the electric potentials of the studied dimers, indicating that this is also the <b>case</b> in hydrogen <b>bonding</b> between peptide groups in proteins. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|Charge {{transfer}} among individual {{atoms in}} a molecule {{is the key}} concept in the modern electronic theory of chemical bonding. In this work, we defined an atomic region between two atoms by Slater orbital exponents of valence electrons and suggested a method for analytical calculation of charge penetration between all atoms in a molecule. Computation of charge penetration amount is self-consistently performed until each orbital exponent converges to its certain values respectively. Charge penetration matrix was calculated for ethylene and MgO, and <b>bonding</b> <b>charge</b> and its distribution were analyzed by using the charge penetration matrix and the orbital exponents under the bonding state. These results were compared with those by density function method and showed that this method is a simple and direct method to obtain <b>bonding</b> <b>charge</b> distribution of molecule from atomic orbital functions...|$|R
40|$|Using {{information}} obtained from X-ray scattering data, {{a model for}} the charge density in the transition metals is constructed. In this model the charge density is given by the sum of the charges situated at the ionic and bond centre sites. Within this framework, expressions for the second order elastic constants and the phonon frequencies in the cubic transition metals are obtained. These quantities have been calculated with and without the <b>bond</b> <b>charge</b> contributions for iron. The comparison with the experimental results shows that the introduction of <b>bond</b> <b>charges,</b> and hence angularity in the force-fields, in iron leads to distinctly better agreement with experiment.

40|$|The {{ground state}} of a {{one-dimensional}} Hubbard {{model with a}} bond-charge attraction W term at half-filling is investigated by the density matrix renormalization group method. It is confirmed that the spin gap will be closed at U> 8 W. But the long-range bond order wave survives even when the spin gap is closed. It indicates that the ground state is a novel dimerized spin fluid at U> 8 W. By a charge-spin transformation, it is shown {{that there should be}} a dimerized metallic phase at U < − 8 W. Furthermore, it is found that the Hubbard interaction U enhances initially the dimerization for a weak <b>bond</b> <b>charge</b> attraction W whereas it reduces monotonously the dimerization for a stronger <b>bond</b> <b>charge</b> attraction W.
