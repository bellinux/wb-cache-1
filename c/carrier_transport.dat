25|$|Transport of ions in the {{electrolyte}} can {{be adjusted}} by tuning the pH value in a dilute ionic solution, or by introducing an external electrical potential to change the surface charge density of the wall. As an analogy to semiconductor devices, the mechanism to control charge <b>carrier</b> <b>transport</b> in electronic devices {{was established in the}} area of nanofluidics. In nanofluidics, the active control of ion transport is realized using nano-scale channels or pores.|$|E
25|$|As {{the channel}} length becomes very short, these {{equations}} become quite inaccurate. New physical effects arise. For example, <b>carrier</b> <b>transport</b> {{in the active}} mode may become limited by velocity saturation. When velocity saturation dominates, the saturation drain current is more nearly linear than quadratic in VGS. At even shorter lengths, carriers transport with near zero scattering, known as quasi-ballistic transport. In the ballistic regime, the carriers travel at an injection velocity that may exceed the saturation velocity and approaches the Fermi velocity at high inversion charge density. In addition, drain-induced barrier lowering increases off-state (cutoff) current and requires an increase in threshold voltage to compensate, which in turn reduces the saturation current.|$|E

50|$|CNT {{may be used}} as a {{photovoltaic}} device {{not only}} as an add-in material to increase <b>carrier</b> <b>transport,</b> but also as the photoactive layer itself. The semiconducting single walled CNT (SWCNT) is a potentially attractive material for photovoltaic applications for the unique structural and electrical properties. SWCNT has high electric conductivity (100 times that of copper) and shows ballistic <b>carrier</b> <b>transport,</b> greatly decreasing carrier recombination. The bandgap of the SWCNT is inversely proportional to the tube diameter, which means that SWCNT may show multiple direct bandgaps matching the solar spectrum.|$|E

40|$|Polymer {{photovoltaic}} cells (PVC) are intensely investigated {{because of their}} potential advantages over Si-based PVCs. Their present drawbacks are low conversion efficiency, limited exciton diffusion length, poor hole <b>carriers</b> <b>transport</b> and short lifetime. The highest conversion efficiency achieved so far in spin-coated polymer blends is close to 5 %. Recently, efficiency growing has been demonstrated in multilayer architectures involving a donor/acceptor bulk heterojunction. Alternatively, a nanomaterial {{has been added to}} the polymer active layer to facilitate excitons dissociation and <b>carriers</b> <b>transport</b> through the polymer matrix. In this work we investigate both these approaches, first embedding single wall Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNT) in the polymericmatrix to improve the electrical transport and second studying the optical absorption of different polymer thin films to optimize the spectral response of the donor/acceptor heterojunction.
