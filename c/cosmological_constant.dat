5|$|Two {{proposed}} {{forms for}} dark energy are the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant,</b> a constant energy density filling space homogeneously, and scalar {{fields such as}} quintessence or moduli, dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space. Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually {{also included in the}} <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant.</b> The <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant</b> can be formulated to be equivalent to vacuum energy. Scalar fields having only a slight amount of spatial inhomogeneity would be difficult to distinguish from a <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant,</b> it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant.</b> In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant.</b> Such a duality is interesting from the point of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.|$|E
5|$|Unlike our universe, {{which is}} now known to be {{expanding}} at an accelerating rate, anti-de Sitter space is neither expanding nor contracting. Instead it looks the same at all times. In more technical language, one says that anti-de Sitter space corresponds to a universe with a negative <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant,</b> whereas the real universe has a small positive <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant.</b>|$|E

5|$|Dark {{energy in}} its {{simplest}} formulation {{takes the form}} of the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant</b> term in Einstein's field equations of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its equation of state and relationship with the Standard Model of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.|$|E
5|$|His {{work on the}} Newtonian limit, {{particularly}} in relation to cosmological solutions, led Ehlers, together with his former doctoral student Thomas Buchert, to a systematic study of perturbations and inhomogeneities in a Newtonian cosmos. This {{laid the groundwork for}} Buchert's later generalization of this treatment of inhomogeneities. This generalization was the basis of his attempt to explain what is currently seen as the cosmic effects of a <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant</b> or, in modern parlance, dark energy, as a non-linear consequence of inhomogeneities in general-relativistic cosmology.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant,</b> to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{observations}} of accelerating expansion imply {{that more and}} more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our event horizon and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant.</b> This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called phantom energy theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called Big Rip.|$|E
5|$|The Einstein field {{equations}} are nonlinear {{and very}} difficult to solve. Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But as early as 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric. This solution {{laid the groundwork for}} the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the Reissner–Nordström solution, now associated with electrically charged black holes. In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology. In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations—the cosmological constant—to match that observational presumption. By 1929, however, the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding. This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922, which do not require a <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant.</b> Lemaître used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the Big Bang models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state. Einstein later declared the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant</b> the biggest blunder of his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{model for}} the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory. The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant</b> (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of the {{constants}} {{that describe}} the current cosmological world model, H 0, t 0, {{and the three}} Ωs is central to physical cosmology. Although there is a vast range of suggested tests and existing constraints much of the recent discussion of <b>cosmological</b> <b>constants</b> involves three time variable photospheres: Cepheids, SNIa, and the CMB last scattering surface.

5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological expansion rate allow {{the total amount of}} matter in the universe to be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant</b> resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{fate of the}} Universe {{is still}} unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index k and the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant</b> Λ. If the Universe were sufficiently dense, k would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch, possibly starting a new Universe in a Big Bounce. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, k would equal 0 or −1 and the Universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Big Freeze and the heat death of the Universe. Modern data suggests {{that the rate of}} expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally, the Universe appears to be flat (k = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.|$|E
25|$|Lambda (λ), {{commonly}} known as the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant,</b> describes the ratio of the density of dark energy to the critical energy density of the universe, given certain reasonable assumptions such as positing that dark energy density is a constant. In terms of Planck units, and as a natural dimensionless value, the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant,</b> λ, is on the order of 10−122. This is so small that it has no significant effect on cosmic structures that are smaller than a billion light-years across.

40|$|We {{consider}} 5 -dimensional cosmological solutions of {{a single}} brane. The correct cosmology on the brane, i. e., governed by the standard 4 -dimensional Friedmann equation, and stable compactification of the extra dimension is guaranteed by {{the existence of a}} nonvanishing ˆ T 5 5 which is proportional to the 4 -dimensional trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We show that this component of the energy-momentum tensor arises from the backreaction of the dilaton coupling to the brane. The same positive features are exhibited in solutions found in the presence of non-vanishing <b>cosmological</b> <b>constants</b> both on the brane (Λbr) and in the bulk (ΛB). Moreover, the restoration of the Friedmann equation, with the correct sign, takes place for both signs of ΛB so long as the sign of Λbr is opposite ΛB in order to cancel the energy densities of the two <b>cosmological</b> <b>constants.</b> We further extend our single-brane thin-wall solution to allow a brane wit...|$|R
25|$|Some {{physicists}} {{believe this}} {{large number of}} solutions is actually a virtue because it may allow a natural anthropic explanation of the observed values of physical constants, in particular the small value of the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant.</b> The anthropic principle {{is the idea that}} some of the numbers appearing in the laws of physics are not fixed by any fundamental principle but must be compatible with the evolution of intelligent life. In 1987, Steven Weinberg published an article in which he argued that the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant</b> could not have been too large, or else galaxies and intelligent life {{would not have been able}} to develop. Weinberg suggested that there might be a huge number of possible consistent universes, each with a different value of the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant,</b> and observations indicate a small value of the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant</b> only because humans happen to live in a universe that has allowed intelligent life, and hence observers, to exist.|$|E
25|$|Instead of the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant</b> itself, cosmologists often {{refer to}} the ratio between the energy density due to the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant</b> and the {{critical}} density of the universe, the tipping point for a sufficient density to stop the universe from expanding forever. This ratio is usually denoted ΩΛ, and {{is estimated to be}} , according to results published by the Planck Collaboration in 2015.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the cosmology of the reduced 5 D Horava-Witten M-Theory (HW) with volume modulus and treating matter on the orbifold planes to first order. It is seen {{that one can}} recover the FRW cosmology in the Hubble expansion era with relativistic matter, but if a solution exist with non-relativistic (massive) matter it must be non-static with a Hubble constant {{that depends on the}} fifth dimension. (The same result holds when 5 -branes are present.) This difficulty is traced to the fact that in HW, the volume modulus couples to the bulk and brane <b>cosmological</b> <b>constants</b> (so that the net 4 D constant vanishes naturally). This situation is contrasted with the Randall-Sundrum 1 model (which is here treated without making the stiff potential approximation) where the radion field does not couple to the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constants</b> (and so one must instead fine tune the net constant to zero). One finds that non-relativistic matter is accommodated there by changing the distance between the end branes. 1...|$|R

25|$|Alexander Friedmann in 1922 {{found that}} Einstein {{equations}} have non-stationary solutions (even {{in the presence}} of the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant).</b> In 1927 Georges Lemaître showed that static solutions of the Einstein equations, which are possible {{in the presence of}} the <b>cosmological</b> <b>constant,</b> are unstable, and therefore the static Universe envisioned by Einstein could not exist. Later, in 1931, Einstein himself agreed with the results of Friedmann and Lemaître. Thus general relativity predicted that the Universe had to be non-static—it had to either expand or contract.
