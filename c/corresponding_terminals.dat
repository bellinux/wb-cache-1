40|$|Abstract—Recent work on {{wireless}} beamforming {{has focused}} on multi-user diversity effects, where terminals are chosen opportunistically based on their responses to test beams. Orthogonality between the test beams is typically chosen to aid subsequent interference-free transmission to the <b>corresponding</b> <b>terminals.</b> However, much of this work assumes that: (i) the pool of terminals on a given frequency-band is large enough that a subset of terminals can be found whose spatial signatures match the test beams; (ii) {{the responses to the}} test beams of the entire pool are known to the basestation; (iii) beamforming considerations can drive traffic scheduling and resource allocation. These conditions are not always met. Rather, we examine orthogonalizing a given set of beams for terminals that are chosen randomly or according to other resource considerations. Our orthogonalization is chosen to maximize the beamforming gain to the desired terminals, with the intent that other terminals may then “eavesdrop ” on the beamformed signals, knowing that the beams are orthogonal. These orthogonal beams can be used for training channel state information even if the actual beams are not known. We distinguish between frequency-division duplex and time-division duplex systems and show that there are training advantages for each. I...|$|E

To avoid possible performance degradations for cases of not evenly spread battery energies, we propose a hybrid approach that interchangeably uses energybased and first-come-first-served CRA’s to resolve packet conflicts. We extend the proposed energy-based collision resolution (CR) approach to cases without hard energy constraints but, rather, with energy-efficiency objectives. The algorithm then utilizes the distance from the receiver as the criterion. We then address energy-efficient conflict resolution in general multi-hop ad-hoc networks. In this context, a useful but yet simple method is proposed to reduce the interdependence between collision resolution processes at different receivers, which would otherwise distort the general structure of tree-splitting algorithms.

40|$|A {{multicast}} game is {{a network}} design game modelling how selfish non-cooperative agents build and maintain one-to-many network communication. There is a special source node {{and a collection of}} agents located at <b>corresponding</b> <b>terminals.</b> Each agent is interested in selecting a route from the special source to its terminal minimizing the cost. The mutual influence of the agents is determined by a cost sharing mechanism, which evenly splits the cost of an edge among all the agents using it for routing. In this paper we provide several algorithmic and complexity results on finding a Nash equilibrium minimizing the value of Rosenthal potential. Let n be the number of agents and G be the communication network. We show that - For a given strategy profile s and integer k>= 1, there is a local search algorithm which in time n^{O(k) }|G|^{O(1) } finds a better strategy profile, if there is any, in a k-exchange neighbourhood of s. In other words, the algorithm decides if Rosenthal potential can be decreased by changing strategies of at most k agents; - The running time of our local search algorithm is essentially tight: unless FPT= W[1], for any function f(k), searching of the k-neighbourhood cannot be done in time f(k) |G|^{O(1) }.

40|$|Abstract — In current {{cooperative}} communication schemes, {{to achieve}} cooperative diversity, synchronization between terminals is usually assumed, {{which may not}} be practical since each terminal has its own local oscillator. In this paper, we first present a necessary and sufficient condition for the space-time trellis codes based on the stack construction proposed by Hammons and El Gamal to possess the full cooperative diversity order without the synchronization assumption. The condition is that the binary generator metrices of the trellis codes are shift full rank (SFR) matrices, i. e., have full row rank no matter the shifts of their row vectors, where a row <b>corresponds</b> to a <b>terminal</b> (or transmit antenna) and the length of a row vector is the memory size of the corresponding trellis code on the <b>corresponding</b> <b>terminal.</b> We then present a simple construction of SFR for any number of rows, whose number of columns, however, grows exponentially with the number of rows.
