He was {{inactive}} as the Chargers third {{quarterback for}} six games. He {{was released by}} the team on October 20, 2010. In November 2010, he had workouts with the Miami Dolphins and Detroit Lions.|$|E
5|$|The faster-moving streams took {{advantage}} of uplift-created joints in the rocks. Eventually, all Cenozoic-aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area.|$|E
5|$|Chaco Culture National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park {{hosting the}} densest and most {{exceptional}} concentration of pueblos in the American Southwest.

5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} {{in a series}} of slits usually <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mother's {{ovipositor}} in live branches or twigs of their food plants. On average about sixteen eggs, among a total batch of a few hundred, are laid in each slit. The batch all hatch around 70 days later – usually within a day or two of one another – but take longer in cold or dry conditions. Oviposition has been observed {{on a wide range of}} native and introduced plant species and can weaken the branches of young orchard trees such that they cannot sustain the load of their fruit.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{is said to}} {{have arrived}} in Glastonbury by boat over the flooded Somerset Levels. On {{disembarking}} he stuck his staff into the ground and it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn (or Holy Thorn). This is said to explain a hybrid Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn) tree that only grows within a few miles of Glastonbury, and which flowers twice annually, once in spring and again around Christmas time (depending on the weather). Each year a sprig of thorn is <b>cut,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> local Anglican vicar and the eldest child from St John's School, and sent to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Marine General Rathvon M. Tompkins, {{commander}} of the 3rd Marine Division, {{has pointed out that}} had NVA actually intended to take Khe Sanh, North Vietnamese troops could have cut the Combat Base's sole source of water, a stream 500 meters outside the perimeter of the base. Had they simply contaminated the stream, the airlift would not have provided enough water to the Marines. Marine Lieutenant General Victor Krulak seconded the notion that there was never a serious intention to take the base by also arguing that neither the water supply nor the telephone land lines were ever <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> North Vietnamese.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau slowly raised these {{formations}} {{much higher}} than where they were deposited. This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral rivers and other streams on the plateau. The faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks to remove all Cenozoic-aged formations and cut gorges into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. Lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area during the later part of this process.|$|E
5|$|The gorge, {{which helped}} protect Bristol Harbour, has been quarried for stone {{to build the}} city, and its {{surrounding}} land has been protected from development as The Downs and Leigh Woods. The Avon estuary and the gorge are the county boundary with North Somerset, and the river flows into the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. Another gorge, <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hazel Brook (which flows into the River Trym), crosses the Blaise Castle estate in northern Bristol.|$|E
5|$|The {{grave in}} Abney Park was {{eventually}} surmounted by a memorial stone for Reed's {{family in the}} style of a Celtic cross, reflecting their connections to Ireland. It was <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> O'Shea brothers' firm. Reed's biographer, the printing executive and historian Stanley Morison, suggests that Reed's legacy is his History of the Old English Letter Foundries, while Jack Cox, historian of the B.O.P, asserts that the school stories first serialised in the magazine are the writer's true memorial.|$|E

5|$|A first {{opening of}} the bridge {{took place in the}} same day with the ceremonies for the {{national}} day on July 14, 1897, in the presence of governor Chabié. The ribbon for the access zone was <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> governor's wife, then the officials walked a short distance to the mobile deck, which was opened to allow the passage of the military ship L'Ardent. 21 cannon shots were fired at dusk and dawn to commemorate the construction of the bridge and on that day there were organised ceremonies including horse races and donkey races. The second opening was on October 19, 1897, in the presence of André Lebon, the prime minister of the French colonies.|$|E
5|$|A mould {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the moulded part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould gates, are located below the parting line or mould surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} mould on the parting line. The moulded part is <b>cut</b> (<b>by</b> <b>the</b> mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould. Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the finished moulded product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.|$|E
5|$|At about 08:00, the 4th Cavalry Division's 2nd Lancers (10th Cavalry Brigade) and the 5th Cavalry Division's 29th Lancers (Deccan Horse) (14th Cavalry Brigade) entered Afulah. Here about 75 German and 200 Ottoman {{prisoners were}} {{captured}} at the railway station, along with ten locomotives and 50 railway trucks or wagons in the sidings. A hospital, an aerodrome with three undamaged aircraft, a large quantity of petrol, and large stocks of champagne and hock were also captured. Armoured cars continued the pursuit, capturing 12 German lorries {{on the road}} to Beisan, while the railway running south and east from Afulah was cut; the line to the west had already been <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 13th Cavalry Brigade (5th Cavalry Division).|$|E

5|$|Chambers and {{his second}} in command, Captain Charles Spragg, {{immediately}} set about constructing a defensive trench across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully {{and out of sight}} to the defenders, so they had to climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks. This tactic worked well, and they broke up the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, and crept up {{to the edge of the}} New Zealanders' trench during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.|$|E
5|$|Heikkinen {{signed on}} as an {{assistant}} coach at Michigan in the spring 1939 initially expressing ambivalence about playing professional football. Then, on September 9, 1939 he had accepted an offer to play with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the NFL. Heikkinen had previously refused offers to play pro football, but the persistence of coach Potsy Clark, and Crisler’s assurance that a coaching job would be open for him in 1940, persuaded Heikkinen to try professional football. Heikkinen noted on signing, though, that he would definitely return to law school in 1940. It was reported that Heikkinen signed a contract for “at least $175 a game” with the Dodgers. Heikkinen was <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dodgers after playing only three games.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 Beyoncé's father {{resigned}} {{from his job}} to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly {{to work on their}} first recording, only to be <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.|$|E

5|$|Jason first {{appeared}} outside of {{film in the}} 1982 novelization of Friday the 13th Part 3 by Michael Avallone. Avallone chose to use an alternate ending, which was filmed for Part 3 but never used, as the ending for his 1982 adaptation. In the alternate film ending, Chris, {{who is in the}} canoe, hears Rick's voice and immediately rushes back to the house. When she opens the door, Jason is standing there with a machete, and he decapitates her. Jason next appears in print in the 1986 novelization of Jason Lives by Simon Hawke, who also adapted the first three films in 1987 and 1988. Jason Lives specifically introduced Elias Voorhees, Jason's father, a character that was slated to appear in the film but was <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> studio. In the novel, instead of being cremated, Elias has Jason buried after his death.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, it {{was mainly}} food that the {{inhabitants}} of Jerusalem needed. Starting 5 June, the Israeli engineers started to fix the road so that it let civil transport trucks pass to supply the city. 150 workers, working in four teams, installed a pipeline to supply the city with water, because the other pipeline, crossing Latrun, had been <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Jordanians. In O Jerusalem, Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins talked about heroic action, when during the night of 6–7 June, in fear of the critical situation of Jerusalem and to improve {{the morale of the}} population, 300 inhabitants of Tel Aviv were requisitioned to carry on their backs, for the few kilometers not yet ready for the trucks, what would be needed to feed {{the inhabitants of}} Jerusalem one more day.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, 1992 Vlasic {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, reuniting himself with former teammate Steve DeBerg. Vlasic began the preseason competing the third-string quarterback job behind Mike Pawlawski while DeBerg and Craig Erickson competed for the starting job. At the end of preseason, however, Vlasic was among the final group <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Buccaneers. When DeBerg was cut from the team in early November, Vlasic was re-signed to the team in his place. He remained on the roster for the 1994 preseason, but his only preseason pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown, and he was waived shortly afterward. This {{marked the end of}} Vlasic's professional football career.|$|E
