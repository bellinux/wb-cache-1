40|$|Computational Aerodynamic {{simulations}} of a 1484 ft/sec tip speed quiet high-speed fan system were performed at five different operating {{points on the}} fan operating line, {{in order to provide}} detailed internal flow field information for use with fan acoustic prediction methods presently being developed, assessed and validated. The fan system is a sub-scale, low-noise research fan/nacelle model that has undergone experimental testing in the 9 - by 15 -foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel at the NASA Glenn Research Center. Details of the fan geometry, the computational fluid dynamics methods, the computational grids, and various computational parameters relevant to the numerical simulations are discussed. Flow field results for three of the five operating points simulated are presented in order to provide a representative look at the computed solutions. Each of the five fan aerodynamic simulations involved the entire fan system, which includes a <b>core</b> <b>duct</b> and a bypass duct that merge upstream of the fan system nozzle. As a result, only fan rotational speed and the system bypass ratio, set by means of a translating nozzle plug, were adjusted in order to set the fan operating point, leading to operating points that lie on a fan operating line and making mass flow rate a fully dependent parameter. The resulting mass flow rates are in good agreement with measurement values. Computed blade row flow fields at all fan operating points are, in general, aerodynamically healthy. Rotor blade and fan exit guide vane flow characteristics are good, including incidence and deviation angles, chordwise static pressure distributions, blade surface boundary layers, secondary flow structures, and blade wakes. Examination of the computed flow fields reveals no excessive or critical boundary layer separations or related secondary-flow problems, {{with the exception of the}} hub boundary layer at the <b>core</b> <b>duct</b> entrance. At that location a significant flow separation is present. The region of local flow recirculation extends through a mixing plane, however, which for the particular mixing-plane model used is now known to exaggerate the recirculation. In any case, the flow separation has relatively little impact on the computed rotor and FEGV flow fields...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve an environmental-friendly engine i. e. with more {{efficiency}} and less noise emission, a geared ultra-high bypass ratio fan test rig has been designed within the EU-funded project SILENCE®. Engine cycle requirements were untypical in terms of mass flow rate, pressure ratio and BPR. In order to reach the desired mass flow rate and simultaneously to avoid a strong interaction of the shocks with the boundary layer an S-shape leading edged rotor with forward sweep close to casing has been designed. Specific blade numbers for rotor and stator {{has been used to}} minimize the rotor-stator interaction noise. For the same purpose a backward swept bypass stator has been designed. There are two stators in the <b>core</b> <b>duct</b> in order to bring the flow to zero swirl which is a necessity for test rig measurements. The main design loop includes blade shape and the flow path optimization as well as the computation of stress distribution in all blades and the rotor disc. The fan is being manufactured from titanium because of its specific aeroelastic properties and stators are made of steel. The rig is scheduled to be tested in 2006 for its aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of compression on pressure drop in flexible, spiral wire helix <b>core</b> <b>ducts</b> used in residential and light commercial applications. Ducts of 6 inches, 8 inches and 10 inches (150, 200 and 250 mm) nominal diameters were tested under different compression configurations following ASHRAE Standard 120 - 1999 [...] Methods of Testing to Determine Flow Resistance of HVAC Air Ducts and Fittings. The results showed that the available published references tend to underestimate the effects of compression. The study demonstrated that moderate compression in flexible ducts, typical of that often seen in field installations, could increase the pressure drop by a factor of four, while further compression could increase the pressure drop by factors close to ten. The results proved that the pressure drop correction factor for compressed ducts cannot be independent of the duct size, as suggested by ASHRAE Fundamentals, and therefore a new relationship was developed for better quantification of the pressure drop in flexible ducts. This study also suggests potential improvements to ASHRAE Standard 120 - 1999 and provides new data for duct design...|$|R

50|$|For primary defogging, heat is {{generally}} {{provided by the}} vehicle's engine coolant via the heater core; fresh air is blown through the heater <b>core</b> and then <b>ducted</b> to and distributed over the interior surface of the windshield by a blower. This air is in many cases first dehumidified by passing it through the vehicle's operating air conditioning evaporator. Such dehumidification makes the defogger more effective and faster, for the dried air has a greater capacity to absorb water from the glass at which it is directed.|$|R
40|$|A two {{dimensional}} nonaxisymmetric Euler solution in a geometric {{representation of a}} jet engine configuration without blades is presented. The domain, including internal and external flow, {{is covered with a}} multiblock grid. To construct the grid, a domain decomposition technique is used to subdivide the domain and smooth grids are dimensioned and placed in each block. The grid contains 44 blocks which cover the external field, the inlet, bypass duct, <b>core</b> <b>duct</b> and nozzle of the nonaxisymmetric engine configuration. The geometry is symmetric about the meanline of the hub, but the grid is not since there is no symmetry condition applied to the grid between the two halves. With a symmetric grid at zero angle of attack, the measures of the solution would cancel exactly. With an asymmetric grid, the solution will not necessarily be symmetric and the lift coefficient will not necessarily be zero. Thus, grid asymmetry can be exploited to verify the resolution of the solution. The solution may be verified on the basis of five theoretical quantities: conservation of mass and energy, deviation of the lift coefficient from zero, deviation of the drag coefficient from zero, deviations from constant entropy, and deviations in the pressure distributions over the symmetric surfaces of the components. This technique is suitable for obtaining numerical solutions in complex geometries and provides a foundation for complete engine throughflow calculations...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design of}} a Low Noise ADP Research Fan stage. The fan is a variable pitch design which is designed at the cruise pitch condition. Relative to the cruise setting, the blade is closed at takeoff and opened for reverse thrust operation. The fan stage is a split flow design with fan exit guide vanes and core stators. This fan stage design was combined with a nacelle and engine <b>core</b> <b>duct</b> to form a powered fan/nacelle, subscale model. This model is intended for use in aerodynamic performance, acoustic and structural testing in a wind tunnel. The model has a 22 -inch outer fan diameter and a hub-to-top ratio of 0. 426 which permits the use of existing NASA fan and cowl force balance designs and rig drive system. The design parameters were selected to permit valid acoustic and aerodynamic comparisons with the PW 17 -inch rig previously tested under NASA contract. The fan stage design is described in detail. The results of the design axisymmetric analysis at aerodynamic design condition are included. The structural analysis of the fan rotor and attachment is described including the material selections and stress analysis. The blade and attachment are predicted to have adequate low cycle fatigue life, and an acceptable operating range without resonant stress or flutter. The stage was acoustically designed with airfoil counts in the fan exit guide vane and core stator to minimize noise. A fan-FEGV tone analysis developed separately under NASA contract was used to determine these airfoil counts. The fan stage design was matched to a nacelle design to form a fan/nacelle model for wind tunnel testing. The nacelle design was developed under a separate NASA contract. The nacelle was designed with an axisymmetric inlet, cowl and nozzle for convenience in testing and fabrication. Aerodynamic analysis of the nacelle confirmed the required performance at various aircraft operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|For {{applications}} in nuclear fusion reactors where magnetic fields are very strong, liquid metal {{flow in the}} <b>core</b> of <b>ducts</b> can often be regarded as inertialess and practically inviscid, while viscous effects are localized in thin boundary layers. The intense electromagnetic Lorentz forces, resulting from the interaction of induced electric currents and imposed magnetic field, tend to remove flow variations along magnetic field lines and they force the fluid to circulate mainly in planes perpendicular to the field. The established quasitwo dimensional (Q 2 D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow can be predicted {{by means of an}} approximate model by reducing the basic governing equations to a 2 D problem by analytical integration along magnetic field lines. Such models have been applied in the past by numerous authors to investigate duct flow problems and magneto-convection. However, limitations of those Q 2 D approaches have never been systematically studied...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{conducted}} {{to develop the}} technology necessary to meet the unique reverse-thrust performance requirements of a variable pitch fan propulsion system are discussed. The losses and distortion associated with the air entering the fan and core compressor {{from the rear of}} the engine, the direction of fan blade pitch rotation for best reverse-thrust aeroacoustic performance, and engine response and operating characteristics during forward- to reverse-thrust transients are among the factors studied. The test results of several scale fan models as well as a full-size variable pitch fan engine are summarized. Results show the following: a flared exhaust nozzle makes a good reverse-thrust inlet; acceptable <b>core</b> inlet <b>duct</b> recovery and distortion levels in reverse flow were demonstrated; adequate thrust levels were achieved; forward- to reverse-thrust response time achieved was better than the goal; thrust and noise levels strongly favor reverse through feather pitch; and finally, flight-type inlets make the establishment of reverse flow more difficult...|$|R

In recent years, their clinical relevance has assumed more importance with the introduction of population based screening programmes. The exact pathogenesis of RS is unknown. Accumulating evidence indicates that they are associated with atypia and/or malignancy and, in addition, may be an independent risk factor for the development of carcinoma in either breast.

40|$|The {{experimental}} database {{established by}} this {{investigation of the}} flow in a large rectangular turning duct is of benchmark quality. The experimental Reynolds numbers, Deans numbers and boundary layer characteristics are significantly different from previous benchmark curved-duct experimental parameters. This investigation extends the experimental database to higher Reynolds number and thinner entrance boundary layers. The 5 % to 10 % thick boundary layers, based on duct half-width, results in a large region of near-potential flow in the <b>duct</b> <b>core</b> surrounded by developing boundary layers with large crossflows. The turbulent entrance boundary layer case at R sub ed = 328, 000 provides an incompressible flowfield which approaches real turbine blade cascade characteristics.

40|$|The noise {{sources and}} {{mechanisms}} {{of the front}} and rear HV AC systems of an automotive are characterized experimentally. The front system has three main outlet ducts equipped with louvers and operates in two modes of bypass and recirculation. The inlet and outlet sides of the rear system are both located in the cabin; hence, it always works only on the recirculation mode. The outlet duct of the rear system is covered by a ten-hole curved plate which is found to be a strong source of noise. Both systems are tested at the highest possible flow rate, as it is the most annoying condition of noise generation. The noise coming out of each duct of {{the front and rear}} systems and their fan units are measured separately. Since the fan {{is an important part of}} the systems, it is studied at different speeds with more details. In order to compare the effect of the noise generated by the fan section with the noise produced by the complete system, the impeller is replaced with a speaker generating an overall sound level similar to the fan noise. Under this condition, the flow noise due to the evaporator <b>core,</b> distributive <b>ducts</b> and louvers are cancelled. It is concluded that at low frequencies the duct flow-noise i...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{inertial}} migration of finite-size neutrally buoyant spherical particles in dilute and semi-dilute suspensions in laminar square duct flow. We perform several direct numerical simulations using an immersed boundary method {{to investigate the}} effects of the bulk Reynolds number Re_b, particle Reynolds number Re_p and duct to particle size ratio h/a at different solid volume fractions ϕ, from very dilute conditions to 20 %. We show that the bulk Reynolds number Re_b is the key parameter in inertial migration of particles in dilute suspensions. At low solid volume fraction (ϕ= 0. 4 %) and low bulk Reynolds number (Re_b= 144), particles accumulate {{at the center of the}} duct walls. As Re_b is increased, the focusing position moves progressively towards the corners of the duct. At higher volume fractions, ϕ= 5, 10 and 20 %, and in wider ducts with Re_b= 550, particles are found to migrate away from the <b>duct</b> <b>core</b> towards the walls. In particular, for ϕ= 5 and 10 %, particles accumulate preferentially at the corners. At the highest volume fraction considered, ϕ= 20 %, particles sample all the volume of the duct, with a lower concentration at the <b>duct</b> <b>core.</b> The presence of particles induces secondary cross-stream motions in the duct cross-section, for all ϕ. The intensity of these secondary flows depends strongly on particle rotation rate, on the maximum concentration of particles in focusing positions, and on the solid volume fraction. We find that the secondary flow intensity increases with the volume fraction up to ϕ= 5 %. However, beyond ϕ= 5 % excluded volume effects lead to a strong reduction of cross-stream velocities.

40|$|Leaky and {{disconnected}} joints in HVAC {{air distribution}} systems are extremely widespread. The average efficiency of duct systems in {{homes in the}} US is approximately 55 % with approximately 60 % of the loss due to duct leakage. Beyond the energy and emissions penalties caused by these leaks, leaky systems have detrimental comfort, health, and safety effects. The health and safety effects include the delivery of combustion products into the homes due to leakage induced depressurization. Current duct installation practice does not attempt to address the problem. This project developed a prototype Professionally Engineered Duct System that will virtually eliminate air leakage {{and that can be}} applied in new and replacement installations at the same labor cost as current designs. It uses snap-together duct fittings that will not come apart, can be applied to all types of duct systems, and cannot be separated without exceptional force. its use would require minimal changes to current installation practice. The research team developed the prototype through a multi-step process beginning with a functional analysis of duct connections. This was followed by identifying duct sealing and attachment methods offering potential to meet design objectives, evaluating the designs in terms of function and economic feasibility, and building and testing the most promising design option. Two versions of this design were developed through a test, revise, retest process. One application was to a rigid sheet metal duct, the other was to a helix <b>core</b> flex <b>duct.</b> The process produced a sheet metal application with 1 / 20 th the leakage of a standard connection and a flex duct application with 1 / 10 th the leakage of a standard connection.

40|$|The Perching Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (PUAV) is a 9 -inch {{diameter}} ducted vertical takeoff {{and landing}} reconnaissance vehicle with {{the capability of}} fast-forward cruise flight. Currently in the development stage, the program is envisaged to yield a man-portable craft that a foot soldier can use to provide over-the-hill observation. Several prototypes have been constructed and tested, with mixed results. Concerns regarding duct aerodynamics led to the proposal for further aerodynamic study to investigate effects of inlet lip radius and surface area, diffuser area ratio, blade tip clearance and rotor position on thrust, power and efficiency. This report covers the theory of rotorcraft and ducted propeller aerodynamics, and outlines the tests performed and results obtained. It also presents specifications of the test vehicle and methods {{that can be used}} in future ducted aircraft studies. Large angle diffusers tested showed reduced thrust and efficiency and increased power compared to smaller diffusers, contrary to theory. Reverse flow within the core appears to disrupt uniform exit flow and yields a conically divergent turbulent wake. Results of this study will be used in the redesign of a <b>duct</b> <b>core</b> fairing, which will act to control the airflow and reduce the tendency for reverse flow at the center where blade thrust is absent. Future studies will also consider twisted, cambered and tapered rotor blades in an effort to better address spanwise thrust distribution and optimized airflow. The test apparatus and methods developed for this report, in addition to results of initial testing, will be instrumental to further development of small ducted UAVs. Findings and methods are not limited to exact duplicates of PUAV-like aircraft, but can be used in a wide range of applications including lift and thrust-producing ducts. by Kyrilian Dyer. Thesis (S.

40|$|Duct leakage {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major source of energy loss in residential buildings. Most duct leakage occurs at the connections to registers, plenums or branches in the duct system. At each of these connections a method of sealing the duct system is required. Typical sealing methods include tapes or mastics applied around the joints in the system. Field examinations of duct systems have typically shown that these seals tend to fail over extended periods of time. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been testing sealant durability for several years. Typical duct tape (i. e. fabric backed tapes with natural rubber adhesives) was found to fail more rapidly than all other duct sealants. This report summarizes the results of duct sealant durability testing of five UL 181 B-FX listed duct tapes (three cloth tapes, a foil tape and an Oriented Polypropylene (OPP) tape). One of the cloth tapes was specifically developed in collaboration with a tape manufacturer to perform better in our durability testing. The first test involved the aging of common ''core-to-collar joints'' of flexible duct to sheet metal collars, and sheet metal ''collar-to-plenum joints'' pressurized with 200 F (93 C) air. The second test consisted of baking duct tape specimens in a constant 212 F (100 C) oven following the UL 181 B-FX ''Temperature Test'' requirements. Additional tests were also performed on only two tapes using sheet metal collar-to-plenum joints. Since an unsealed flexible duct joint can have a variable leakage depending on the positioning of the flexible <b>duct</b> <b>core,</b> the durability of the flexible duct joints could not be based on the 10 % of unsealed leakage criteria. Nevertheless, the leakage of the sealed specimens prior to testing could be considered as a basis for a failure criteria. Visual inspection was also documented throughout the tests. The flexible duct core-to-collar joints were inspected monthly, while the sheet metal collar-to-plenum joints were inspected weekly. The baking test specimens were visually inspected weekly, and the durability was judged by the observed deterioration in terms of brittleness, cracking, flaking and blistering (the terminology used in the UL 181 B-FX test procedure) ...|$|R
40|$|Low and {{high-grade}} ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) {{are known}} to be highly disparate by a multitude of parameters, including progression potential, immunophenotype, gene expression profile and DNA ploidy. In this study, we analyzed a group of intermediate and high-grade DCIS cases to determine how well the core biopsy predicts the maximal pathology in the associated excisions, and to determine if there are any core biopsy morphologic features that may predict a close (≤ 0. 2 cm) or positive margin in the subsequent excision. Forty-nine consecutive paired specimens [core biopsies with a maximal diagnosis of DCIS, and their corresponding excisions, which included 20 and 29 specimens from mastectomies and breast conserving surgeries respectively] were evaluated in detail. In 5 (10 %) of 49 cases, no residual carcinoma was found in the excision. In another 4 cases, the changes were diagnostic only of atypical ductal hyperplasia. There were 4 and 3 respective cases of invasive and microinvasive carcinoma out of the 49 excision specimens, for an overall invasion frequency of 14 %. In 28 cases where a sentinel lymph node evaluation was performed, only 1 was found to be positive. Among the 40 cases with at least residual DCIS in the excision, there were 5 cases in which comedo-pattern DCIS was present in the excision but not in the core biopsy, attributed to the lower maximal nuclear grade in the biopsy proliferation in 4 cases and the absence of central necrosis in the 5 th. For the other main histologic patterns, in 8 (20 %) of 40 cases, there were more patterns identified in the core biopsy than in the corresponding excision. For the other 32 cases, 100 %, 66 %, 50 %, 33 % and 25 % of the number of histologic patterns in the excisions were captured in 35 %, 5 %, 17. 5 %, 15 % and 7. 5 % of the preceding core biopsies respectively. Therefore, the core biopsy reflected {{at least half of the}} non-comedo histologic patterns in 77. 5 % of cases. In 6 (15 %) of the 40 cases, the maximum nuclear grade of the excision (grade 3) was higher than that seen in the core biopsy (grade 2). Overall, however, the maximum nuclear grade in the excision was significantly predicted by maximum nuclear grade in the core biopsy (p = 0. 028), with a Phi of 0. 347, indicating a moderately strong association. At a size threshold of 2. 7 cm, there was no significant association between lesional size and core biopsy features. Furthermore, the clear margin width of the cases with lesional size ≤ 2. 7 cm (mean 0. 69 cm) was not significantly different (p = 0. 4) from the cases with lesional size > 2. 7 cm (mean 0. 56 cm). Finally, among a variety of core biopsy features that were evaluated, including maximum nuclear grade, necrosis, cancerization of lobules, number of tissue cores with DCIS, number of DCIS <b>ducts</b> per tissue <b>core,</b> total DCIS <b>ducts,</b> or comedo-pattern, only necrosis was significantly associated with a positive or close (≤ 0. 2 cm) margin on multivariate analysis (Phi of 0. 350). It is concluded that a significant change [to invasive disease (14 %) or to no residual disease (10 %) ] is seen in approximately 24 % of excisions that follow a core biopsy diagnosis of intermediate or high-grade DCIS. Core biopsy features are of limited value in predicting a close or positive margin in these lesions...|$|R
