5|$|In the 1980s {{the city}} entered {{a period of}} rapid growth and the service sector overtook trade, {{industry}} and crafts as the leading sector of employment for the first time. Workers gradually began commuting to the city from most of east and <b>central</b> <b>Jutland</b> as the region became more interconnected. The student population tripled between 1965 and 1977 turning the city into a Danish centre of research and education. The growing and comparably young population initiated a period of creativity and optimism; Gaffa and the KaosPilot school were founded in 1983 and 1991 respectively, and Aarhus was at the centre of a renaissance in Danish rock and pop music launching bands and musicians such as TV2, Gnags, Thomas Helmig, Bamses Venner, Anne Dorte Michelsen, Mek Pek and Shit & Chanel.|$|E

25|$|The {{air force}} {{was led by}} Lieutenant General C.C.J. Førslev, who had {{previously}} served as colonel {{in the army and}} as first commander of the Danish Army Air Corps. The national command was located at Værløse Air Base which also served as Command East, while Command West was located at Karup in <b>central</b> <b>Jutland.</b> Royal Air Force volunteer and former member of the Free Norwegian Forces in England, Kaj Birksted, was appointed chief of the flying staff. The rivalries and mutual disrespect between the established officer Førslev, who had never been in air combat himself, and the experienced fighter ace Birksted led to a series of misunderstandings which delayed the operationalization of the air force. Further, the East and West commands lacked experience and knowledge of the newly delivered Gloster Meteor and F-84 Thunderjet aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|Traditional dialects differ both in phonology, {{grammar and}} {{vocabulary}} from standard Danish. Phonologically, {{one of the}} most diagnostic differences is {{the presence or absence of}} stød. There are four main regional variants for the realization of stød: In Southeastern Jutlandic, Southernmost Funen, Southern Langeland and Ærø, there is no stød but instead a pitch accent. South of a line (Stødgrænsen [...] "The Stød border") going through <b>central</b> South <b>Jutland,</b> crossing Southern Funen and central Langeland and north of Lolland-Falster, Møn, Southern Zealand and Bornholm there is neither stød nor pitch accent. In most of Jutland and on Zealand there is stød, and in Zealandic traditional dialects and regional language there are often more stød occurrences than in the standard language. In Zealand the stød line divides Southern Zealand (without stød), an area which used to be directly under the Crown, from the rest of the Island that used to be the property of various noble estates.|$|R

For each hemodialysis patient, we sam-pled 19 persons {{from the general population}} matched on age, gender, and municipality. In-formation on positive blood cultures was obtained from regional microbiology databases. All persons were observed from cohort entry until first episode of bloodstream infection, emi-gration, death, or end of hemodialysis treatment, whichever came first.

50|$|After the Second War of Schleswig in 1864, two new {{movements}} hit Denmark. One was {{a successful}} attempt to reclaim moors in <b>central</b> and western <b>Jutland</b> for farming; mostly sandy land abandoned in the 14th century {{as a result of}} the Black Plague, but in many cases good for potatoes. This movement was initiated by Hedeselskabet (the Heath Association). Equally important was an influx to the world market of grain from the Russian provinces Ukraine and Poland, resulting in a sharp drop in price. The most important factor was a flood of agricultural imports to Britain, Denmark's primary market for grains, from a rapidly industrializing United States, which caused not only a sharp drop in prices, but an agriculture crisis throughout Europe in the final decade of the 19th century. This affected the income of many Danish farmers and the result was a change in production; from grain to dairy products and meat. When a farmer couldn't sell his grain, he fed it to his cows and pigs.|$|R

This population-based cohort study aims to estimate risk and case fatality of bloodstream infection among chronic hemodialysis patients. In this population-based cohort study we identified residents with {{end-stage renal disease}} in <b>Central</b> and North <b>Jutland,</b> Denmark who had hemodialysis as first renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis patients) during 1995 - 2010. For each hemodialysis patient, we sampled 19 persons {{from the general population}} matched on age, gender, and municipality. Information on positive blood cultures was obtained from regional microbiology databases. All persons were observed from cohort entry until first episode of bloodstream infection, emigration, death, or end of hemodialysis treatment, whichever came first. Incidence-rates and incidence-rate ratios were computed and risk factors for bloodstream infection assessed by Poisson regression. Case fatality was compared by Cox regression. Among 1792 hemodialysis patients and 33 618 matched population controls, we identified 461 and 1126 first episodes of bloodstream infection, respectively. Incidence rates of first episode of bloodstream infection were 13. 7 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 12. 5 - 15. 0) per 100 person-years among hemodialysis patients and 0. 53 (95 % CI, 0. 50 - 0. 56) per 100 person-years among population controls. In hemodialysis patients, the most common causative microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (43. 8 %) and Escherichia coli (12. 6 %). The 30 -day case fatality was similar among hemodialysis patients and population controls 16 % (95 % CI, 13 %- 20 %) vs. 18 % (95 % CI, 15 %- 20 %). Hemodialysis patients have extraordinary high risk of bloodstream infection while short-term case fatality following {{is similar to that of}} population controls...|$|R
40|$|Background: Type- 1 and type- 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is {{associated}} with an increased fracture risk and possibly an increased risk of death following a fracture. Aim: To investigate the association between diabetes related drugs and mortality following a fracture. Methods: A nested case-control study was conducted. Cases were patients with DM who died following a fracture; controls were DM patients not dying after a fracture. We identified DM patients using the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register (1977 - 2011) and included information on date of DM diagnosis, date of fracture and comorbidities. From the Danish Cause of Death Register the date of death was collected (2008 - 2011). From the <b>Central</b> Region of <b>Jutland,</b> Denmark, medication use was collected (2008 - 2011). Analysis was performed by unconditional logistic regression. Results: 2, 621 diabetes patients with a fracture following the diabetes diagnosis and with information on medication use were included. Of these 229 died. In a multivariate analysis, statin use (n= 1, 106 (42 %) statin users, odds ratio (OR) = 0. 60, 95 % confidence interval, p= 0. 012) decreased the risk of dying subsequent to a fracture. Male gender (OR= 1. 57, p= 0. 005), increasing age (OR= 1. 08, p< 0. 001), a diagnosis of retinopathy (OR= 2. 12, p= 0. 008), heart failure (OR= 1. 68, p= 0. 004) and use of glucocorticoids (OR= 2. 22, p= 0. 001) were {{associated with an increased}} risk of death. None of the antidiabetics; biguanides, glucagon-like receptor agonists, β-cell stimulants, glitazones, and insulin were associated with mortality. Conclusion: Co-morbidity reflected by late onset complications, heart failure and glucocorticoid use was associated with an increased risk of mortality subsequent to a fracture. Statin use may reduce mortality subsequent to a fracture in diabetes patients. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether diabetes patients with a fracture should initiate statin treatment...|$|R
