5|$|During {{the reign}} of Ösel-Wiek Bishop, every canon was {{supposed}} to lead a chaste and virtuous life {{according to the rules}} of the monastery. Access of women to the Episcopal Castle was forbidden by threat of death. A legend tells that a canon fell in love with an Estonian girl and brought secretly the maiden into the castle. She hid by dressing as a choirboy and remained a secret for a long time, but when the bishop visited Haapsalu again, the young singer <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> and he ordered an investigation of the singer's gender.|$|E

By Dahmer's admission, what <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to Steven Hicks hitchhiking {{was the fact that}} the youth was bare-chested. He was bludgeoned with a {{dumbbell}} and strangled to death with this instrument before being dismembered. Remains pulverized and scattered in woodland behind Dahmer's childhood home.|$|E
25|$|A gracious, charming man in {{an old-fashioned}} Austrian manner, he seemed in later life almost the archetypal {{professor}} of popular imagination, with straggly white hair, wayward handwriting, and an infectious enthusiasm for anything that <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention.</b> Like Goethe he believed that literature could {{have an effect on}} individuals and mould them into world citizens. As a teacher he had a rare ability to bring poetry alive, and published on it prolifically.|$|E

25|$|Tompkins began {{teaching}} at St. F.X. in 1902. As vice-president {{of the university}} he attended the Conference of British Empire Universities in London, England in 1912, and returned filled with ideas for ways that the university could become more involved in solving rural economic problems through adult education. British Workers Educational Associations, the Danish Folk High Schools, and Swedish Study Circles particularly interested him. And in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan's agricultural program, and Quebec's agricultural colleges and credit unions, <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{scouting}} in Sweden in 1993, Andersson {{visited the}} national team selection camp for players born in 1973 in order to scout players such as Peter Forsberg and Markus Näslund, and while there noticed a young Tomas Holmström. The next year Holmström <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> again when Holmström's coach at the time, Niklas Wikegård, described Holmström as the best player on the team. In 1994 the Red Wings {{for the first time}} gave Andersson a draft pick, their 10th round pick, meaning he had first and final say over who would be chosen by the team in that round. Andersson chose Holmström, who has since been part of four Stanley Cup winning teams in Detroit.|$|E
25|$|Avalon {{was formed}} in 1995 after Norman Miller of Proper Management took {{the idea of a}} vocal group to Grant Cunningham, A Director at Sparrow Records. Miller's vision was to have two male and two female vocalists who could sing tight harmonies and carry the Gospel to the world. Cunningham publicized his {{intentions}} and received many demo tapes, but nothing fit his desires. After letting the idea of Avalon rest a while, Cunningham attended an artist showcase in Nashville to listen to a singer. However, another artist, Michael Passons, <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention,</b> and Passons {{was the first of the}} group's founding members. Soon after, former Truth vocalist and South Carolina native Janna Potter (Long) heard about Avalon's formation. Rikk Kittleman and Tabitha Fair became part of the group, but each left after a short time. Fair was offered a solo record deal, and Kittleman left for other opportunities. With two member openings, Long contacted former Truth vocalist Jody McBrayer, who became a member of Avalon a few days later. Nikki Hassman Anders was the fourth founding vocalist of Avalon. Hassman recorded two albums with Avalon, Avalon (December 26, 1996) and A Maze of Grace (December 1997), but left in May 1998 to pursue a solo career with Sony Records.|$|E
60|$|And now, {{hosts of}} bewildering and {{confused}} ideas came crowding on his mind. He {{seemed to be}} still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing--for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> own <b>attention,</b> as it were, by making some violent effort to save himself from falling, he {{found that he was}} talking to them. Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber's grasp upon his wrist. Suddenly, he started back at the report of firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.|$|R
5000|$|René Barbier III was {{descended from}} a family of French winemakers {{although}} he was born in Tarragona and grew up in Catalonia. Coming with his wife Isabelle Meyer and their young children to the Priorat region, he found a promising wine region that had for years been neglected although excellent wines had sometimes appeared such as the seminal 1974 vintage from Cellers de Scala Dei. [...] This wine <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> and others <b>attention</b> and he was eventually able to gather a group to make a single wine together in the same cellar although released under different labels. There were initially 10 different labels which morphed in to the main five that are seen today. [...] Ironically, despite being a defining wine for the region, at 12.5% alcohol it didn't qualify for DOQ certification as the minimum for a red wine is 13%.|$|R
60|$|Back of {{the cattle}} shed, at a {{distance}} of several hundred feet, was a slight hollow, where there was a pool of water surrounded by mesquite-trees and bushes.

500|$|Watson's new column quickly broadened {{its scope}} {{to cover all}} aspects of life in Seattle. In 1959 it was rechristened [...] "This, Our City." [...] By 1962, the column, {{primarily}} a [...] "three dot" [...] compilation of short items, was running five days a week. When a particular issue <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention,</b> Watson would produce a longer, essay-style column. It was these essay-style columns that provided most of the fodder for his 1993 book, My Life in Print.|$|E
500|$|Toward music {{more adventurous}} than Wagner's, {{especially}} that of Richard Strauss and later Claude Debussy, Rimsky-Korsakov's mind remained closed. He would fume for days afterwards {{when he heard}} pianist Felix Blumenfeld play Debussy's Estampes and write in his diary about them, [...] "Poor and skimpy to the nth degree; there is no technique, even less imagination." [...] This {{was part of an}} increasing musical conservatism on his part (his [...] "musical conscience," [...] as he put it), under which he now scrutinized his music and that of others as well. Compositions by his former compatriots in The Five were not immune. While working on his first revision of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, in 1895 he would tell his amanuensis, Vasily Yastrebtsev, [...] "It's incredible that I ever could have liked this music and yet it seems there was such a time." [...] By 1901 he would write of growing [...] "indignant at all [...] blunders of the ear"—this about the same music which <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> in 1889.|$|E
500|$|Following {{publication}} of Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson's nonfiction book Lone Survivor (2007), producer Barry Spikings met Luttrell's attorney, Alan Schwartz, who {{was interested in}} adapting the book to film. Schwartz suggested that Spikings's son-in-law, Akiva Goldsman, write the screenplay. Goldsman however did not believe he was the right screenwriter for the project; he suggested that Peter Berg write and direct the film. Spikings and Goldsman passed the book on to Berg's producing partner Sarah Aubrey. [...] Berg first learned of Lone Survivor while filming Hancock, and after Aubrey had read the book herself. After Berg had read the book, he and Aubrey arranged several meetings with Luttrell to discuss a film adaptation. Luttrell also viewed a rough cut of Berg's then-upcoming 2007 film The Kingdom, and was impressed by Berg's direction. [...] " [...] <b>caught</b> me with <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to detail", he said, [...] "and how he portrayed the enemy in the film." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was in this}} mood, {{exhausted}} by a visit to his lawyer, that he stepped into a military club and took up a newspaper. Caring little for politics, his eye wandered over, uninterested, its pugnacious leading articles and tedious parliamentary reports; and {{he was about to}} throw it down when a paragraph <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> notice which instantly engrossed all <b>his</b> <b>attention.</b> It was in the 'Morning Post' that he thus read: ...|$|R
60|$|He now for {{the first}} time heard on all sides distinctly, the {{confused}} noises which still rose from every quarter of Rome. The same incessant strife of struggling voices and hurrying footsteps, which had <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> ear in the early morning, attracted <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> now; but no shrieks of distress, no clash of weapons, no shouts of fury and defiance, were mingled with them; although, as he perceived by the position of the sun, the day had sufficiently advanced to have brought the Gothic army long since to the foot of the walls. What could be the cause of this delay in the assault; of this ominous tranquillity on the ramparts above him? Had the impetuosity of the Goths suddenly vanished at the sight of Rome? Had negotiations for peace been organised with the first appearance of the invaders? He listened again. No sounds <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> ear differing in character from those he had just heard. Though besieged, the city was evidently--from some mysterious cause--not even threatened by an assault.|$|R
500|$|The band {{returned}} to the music industry again in 2001. Producer Tim Sommer signed them to a demo deal with MCA Records and produced three tracks with them in Los Angeles {{in the middle of}} 2001 with Mark Dearnley engineering. Against Sommer's advice, MCA declined to pick up the band, and these tracks were never released. The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before falling into the hands of Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman and David Boxenbaum. While looking for talent for the Octone label, Berkman was given a bunch of demos by the brother of a former colleague at Columbia Records and the song that <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> was [...] "'Sunday Morning'" [...] which he referred it as a [...] "genius song". Berkman was surprised the song was credited to Kara's Flowers, because the band sounded completely different from the one he had heard while at Warner Brothers.|$|E
500|$|Padden {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career with the}} Roanoke Magicians, a minor league club in the Virginia State League in 1895, where he played with and managed the team to a 52–74 win–loss record. [...] During the 1896 season, the Pittsburgh Pirates manager, Connie Mack, was seeking a replacement for Harry Truby, his second baseman, who was not performing well, when Padden <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention.</b> [...] Padden was playing for the Toronto Canadiens in the Eastern League, and had a reputation of being a smart and quick player with good instincts, {{as well as a}} [...] "careful, timely batsman". [...] Based on his need to upgrade his second base position, and Padden's good reputation, Mack traded Truby for him. [...] He began his major league career shortly thereafter on July 15, one day after Truby's final game in the majors. [...] When Padden did not bat well to start the season, Mack and Pittsburgh's president and part owner, William Kerr, began to feud over the decision, with Kerr questioning Mack over whether they should have traded Truby. [...] However, his hitting improved and he completed the season with a [...]242 batting average in 61games played.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to taking songwriting classes, Kesha was also {{taught how to}} write songs by Pebe, and they would often write together when she returned home from high school. Kesha began recording demos which Pebe would give to people she knew. Kesha was also in a band with Lagan. Kesha and Pebe co-wrote the song [...] "Stephen" [...] together when Kesha was 16, Kesha then tracked down David Gamson, a producer that she admired, from Scritti Politti who agreed to produce the song. She {{dropped out of school}} at 17, after being convinced by Dr. Luke and Max Martin to return to Los Angeles to pursue a music career, and earned her GED after. Around this time, Pebe answered an ad by reality series The Simple Life, looking for an [...] "eccentric" [...] family to host Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. The episode aired in 2005. Luke and Martin had received one of Kesha's demos from Samantha Cox, senior director of writer/publisher relations at Broadcast Music Incorporated, and were impressed. Two of the demos were described in a cover story for Billboard, the first [...] "a gorgeously sung, self-penned country ballad" [...] and the second [...] "a gobsmackingly awful trip-hop track" [...] where Kesha raps ad lib for a minute when she runs out of lyrics near the end. Dr. Luke stated in an interview for the story that it was the latter track that <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention,</b> saying [...] "when you're listening to 100 CDs, that kind of [...] and chutzpah stand out." ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} {{a little}} bent branch {{from which the}} bruised leaves drooped limply <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> eye, for he had trained his powers of observation following the deer at the ranch, and moving a trifle he noticed one that was broken.

Peel recalled, [...] "I {{was one of the}} first lot on Radio 1 and I think it was mainly because ... Radio 1 had no real idea what they were doing so they had to take people off the pirate ships because there wasn't anybody else." [...] Peel presented a programme called Top Gear. At first he was obliged to share presentation duties with other DJs (Pete Drummond and Tommy Vance were among his co-hosts) but in February 1968 he was given sole charge of Top Gear; he continued to present the show until it ended in 1975.
