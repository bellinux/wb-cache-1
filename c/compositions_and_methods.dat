40|$|Title: Body <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> for its {{determination}} Objectives: Perform {{a literature}} search and then describe {{the human body}} <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> compare different <b>methods</b> to determine body composition in humans. Methods: Review and comparison of domestic and foreign literature that deals with body <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> its measurements. Results: Research summarized {{the literature on the}} topic of physical body <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> for its determination. Another result is a summarization of indirect methods, describe their advantages and disadvantages, practical use and calculation examples of predictive equations for specific methods. Indirect methods of determining body composition may be once or twice indirect. Among once belong mainly indirect laboratory methods such as DEXA, APD, NIR or nuclear magnetic resonance. The gold standard of laboratory methods are considered DEXA method. These methods are indirect in comparison with twice more accurate but more time-consuming and equipment. The two indirect methods belong field methods such as BIA, BMI, skinfold thickness measurements with calipers or hydrostatic weighing method. These methods are indeed more practical and affordable measured but with less precision. For the most used <b>and</b> practical field <b>method</b> is considered BIA.

Application of liposomes prepared from lipids with a composition {{similar to that of the}} stratum corneum resulted in almost twice the amount of interferon being deposited in the deeper skin layers than did application of liposomes prepared from phospholipids. Topical application of "skin lipid" liposomes prepared by the dehydration-rehydration method was twice as effective as was topical application of liposomes prepared by the reverse-phase evaporation method with respect to their ability to deposit interferon into the skin strata where the basal cell layers reside. These results are consistent with the effects of liposomal <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> <b>method</b> of preparation on the ability of the formulation to reduce lesion scores in the cutaneous herpes simplex virus type 1 guinea pig model...|$|R

They experimented with different glass <b>compositions</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> of heating the glass. In August 1970, Keck took measurements of the newest batch of fibers he had heat-treated. When Keck noticed the light passed through the 65 foot fiber seemingly without any loss, he exclaimed [...] "Good grief, what do I have here?" [...] Keck took more measurements of the fiber, and discovered it had an attenuation of 16 db/km, exceeding the goal of 20 db/km. Upon this discovery, Keck wrote in his laboratory notebook, [...] "Attenuation equals 16 db it says. Eureka," [...] followed by an exclamatory [...] "Whoopee!". Keck and his team had invented the first low-loss optical fiber; it was composed of heat-treated titanium-doped silica. Papers were written and patents were filed.|$|E
