50|$|Karlsvärd Fortress (Karlsvärds fästning) is {{a former}} {{fortification}} {{on the island of}} Enholmen near Slite on Gotland, Sweden. In its place Enholmen Fortress (Enholmens fästning) was built in the mid-1800s. It was decommissioned in 1905 and was then used as a training ground for the coastal artillery. During the 1990s it was used as a naval <b>mine</b> <b>control</b> <b>station</b> before the island was demilitarized in 2011. Karlsvärd Fortress ruin is since 2015 managed by the National Property Board.|$|R
50|$|During World War I and World War II, Enholmen was {{manned by}} {{military}} guards. A number of firing and observation bunkers was built {{during this time}} along the beach. After the wars, the coastal artillery in Fårösund used Enholmen as the location for emergency response exercises. From the 1950s to the 1900s a naval <b>mine</b> <b>control</b> <b>station</b> was situated in the old fortress. About fifteen meters underground were three large containers where dozens of people worked, slept and kept supplies before the station was closed in the 1990s. In 2008 {{it was decided that}} Enholmen would be sold by the Swedish Fortifications Agency. During 2010-11 Enholmen was demilitarized. In 2013 the Cultural Property Inquiry proposed that Enholmen would remain under state ownership. The National Property Board manages Karlsvärd Fortress ruin since 2015.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II Fort Foster's heavy {{guns were}} {{superseded}} {{by a new}} 16-inch (406 mm) gun battery at Fort Dearborn. The 10-inch guns of Battery Bohlen were scrapped in 1942. However, new construction also took place at Fort Foster {{as part of the}} general improvement of US coast defenses that began in 1940. In 1940-1944 the Harbor Defenses of Portsmouth were garrisoned by the 22nd Coast Artillery Regiment. A new <b>mine</b> <b>control</b> <b>station</b> and <b>mine</b> casemate were built near the former 10-inch battery, along with two new gun batteries at a different location. Battery 205, begun in 1942, was to have two 6-inch (152 mm) M1 guns on shielded barbette carriages with a bunker for ammunition and fire control, but construction was suspended in 1944 and the battery was never armed. A six-story fire control tower was constructed to spot targets for this battery. Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat Battery (AMTB) 952 was also built at Fort Foster in 1943, with an authorized strength of two fixed 90 mm guns and two towed 90 mm guns.|$|R
25|$|Krepost Sveaborg {{never did}} see action against Germany in Russian hands. After the Russian {{revolution}} {{the treaty of}} Brest-Litovsk ended Russia's participation in the First World War. The treaty affirmed the independence of Finland and required Russian troops to leave from the country. Of the approximately 35 000 Russian soldiers and sailors who were around Helsinki in January 1918 most were demobilized and sent home or simply left by 15 March. Around one thousand joined the Finnish Red Guards in the Finnish Civil War. The Soviet leadership ordered Krepost Sveaborg headquarters to begin preparations to abandon the fortress and destroy what could not be evacuated in case it would fall into German hands. Some field guns were transported to Russia, but all the coastal guns were left. On 3 April 1918 German Baltic Sea Division landed in Hanko, after being requested by the White Senate of Vaasa {{to participate in the}} Finnish Civil War against the Reds. Russian Baltic fleet officers had made an agreement with the Germans allowing a safe departure for the warships and disarming the fortress. Most of the Russian ships left by mid-April, but the last ships left only in May–June 1918. The disarmament - removing locks from the guns, cutting the cables <b>controlling</b> the <b>mines</b> and destroying the <b>mine</b> <b>control</b> <b>stations</b> - had to be done in secret as an agreement between Soviet government and Finnish Red Guards had promised the latter all the fortifications. When the Germans arrived in Helsinki the Red Guard could only use some of the land front fortifications in Leppävaara and Ruskeasuo, and the Germans with a well equipped and trained numerically superior force quickly captured Helsinki between 11th and 13 April. The Russian guards ceded the coastal forts to Germans according to their agreement. The disarmament of Krepost Sveaborg, denying the Reds from using it, was used in White propaganda by how Allan Staffans had duped the Russians and removed the locks without authorization; but actually the disarmament occurred with the order of the fortress commander and with the knowledge of naval headquarters. On 12 May Krepost Sveaborg was renamed Suomenlinna to celebrate the new independency.|$|R

40|$|Deformations of {{engineering}} structures {{and the earth}} crust are often measured to monitor the behavior and safety of constructed structures. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have evolved as an important tool for monitoring deformation. This study investigated the deformation of the earth’s crust using GPS at Tarkwa, an important <b>mining</b> town. Fifteen <b>control</b> <b>stations</b> were established for the monitoring. Two of these were used as reference stations, eight were established about 200 - 500 m to mining sites and five others established about 1 000 - 2 000 m from the mining areas. Field measurements were carried out every two weeks {{for a period of}} six months. Analysis of the results revealed both lateral and vertical movements in the area, with average displacement values of 13 mm for most stations close (200 - 500 m) to the mines and 5 mm for stations relatively far (1 000 - 2 000 m) from the mines. Lateral movements were the greatest, ranging from 0. 00 mm to 19. 00 mm and vertical movements were from- 1. 00 mm to 11. 00 mm. Cracks on some buildings in communities closer to mining areas corroborates the results. TS 2 D – Deformation Measurement Using GNS...|$|R

5000|$|Frequently used in {{combination}} with coastal artillery and hydrophones, <b>controlled</b> <b>mines</b> (or command detonation mines) can be in place in peacetime, which is a huge advantage in blocking important shipping routes. The mines can usually be turned into [...] "normal" [...] mines with a switch (which prevents the enemy from simply capturing the <b>controlling</b> <b>station</b> and deactivating the mines), detonated on a signal or be allowed to detonate on their own. The earliest ones were developed around 1812 by Robert Fulton. The first remotely <b>controlled</b> <b>mines</b> were moored mines used in the American Civil War, detonated electrically from shore.
