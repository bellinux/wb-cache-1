5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} to measure how {{strongly}} different genes are expressed {{in a sample of}} biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by a log ratio of , a halved expression rate <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by a log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by a log ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E

5|$|A path in a {{directed}} graph <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by {{a sequence of}} edges having the property that the ending vertex of each edge in the sequence {{is the same as}} the starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence; a path forms a cycle if the starting vertex of its first edge equals the ending vertex of its last edge. A directed acyclic graph is a {{directed graph}} that has no cycles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.|$|E

5|$|Because each {{configuration}} {{has only}} a bounded number of predecessors, the evolution of Rule 90 preserves the entropy of any configuration. In particular, if an infinite initial configuration is selected by choosing the state of each cell independently at random, {{with each of the}} two states being equally likely to be selected, then each subsequent configuration <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by exactly the same probability distribution.|$|E
5|$|Consider a {{particle}} moving under an arbitrary central force F1(r) whose magnitude depends {{only on the}} distance r between the particle and a fixed center. Since the motion of {{a particle}} under a central force always lies in a plane, {{the position of the}} particle <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by polar coordinates (r,θ1), the radius and angle of the particle relative to the center of force (Figure1). Both of these coordinates, r(t) and θ1(t), change with time t as the particle moves.|$|E
5|$|Given a {{set with}} an {{addition}} operation, one cannot always define a corresponding subtraction operation on that set; {{the set of}} natural numbers is a simple example. On the other hand, a subtraction operation uniquely determines an addition operation, an additive inverse operation, and an additive identity; for this reason, an additive group <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as a set that is closed under subtraction.|$|E

5|$|Nethicite, {{another type}} of magicite, works by {{absorbing}} Mist, thus nullifying the effects of magic and storing vast amounts of power. Nethicite <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as either deifacted or manufacted (literally, god-made or man-made). During {{the course of the}} game, it is discovered that deifacted nethicite is nethicite created by the Occuria, and that the ultimate source of known pieces of deifacted nethicite is the Sun-Cryst they created. Deifacted nethicite contains a large amount of magic and is known to influence the history of Ivalice.|$|E
5|$|Reversible {{inhibition}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> quantitatively {{in terms}} of the inhibitor's binding to the enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex, and its effects on the kinetic constants of the enzyme. In the classic Michaelis-Menten scheme below, an enzyme (E) binds to its substrate (S) to form the enzyme–substrate complex ES. Upon catalysis, this complex breaks down to release product P and free enzyme. The inhibitor (I) can bind to either E or ES with the dissociation constants Ki or Ki', respectively.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{have what}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as an {{incomplete}} gut; the gastrovascular cavity {{functions as a}} stomach and possesses a single opening to the outside, which operates as both a mouth and anus. Waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears a groove at one or both ends. The groove, termed a siphonophore, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through the gastrovascular cavity.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} form {{complete}} series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends. These compounds <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions. This description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes {{less and less}} accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase, and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable. For instance, ionic bonding gives way to metallic bonding along the series NaCl, Na2O, Na2S, Na3P, Na3As, Na3Sb, Na3Bi, Na.|$|E
5|$|The {{matching}} rules <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> in several ways. One {{approach is to}} color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another {{is to use a}} pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by the ovarian or uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle {{describes}} {{changes that occur}} in the follicles of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining of the uterus. Both cycles can be divided into three phases. The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.|$|E

5|$|The {{process by}} which an {{organisation}} achieves sufficient prominence that {{it is able to}} exercise naked power <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as the rule of three phases (Russell 1938:63). According to this rule, what begins as fanaticism {{on the part of some}} crowd eventually produces conquest by means of naked power. Eventually, the acquiescence of the outlying population transforms naked power into traditional power. Finally, once a traditional power has taken hold, it engages in the suppression of dissent by the use of naked power.|$|E
5|$|The stable {{homotopy}} {{groups of}} spheres {{are important in}} singularity theory, which studies the structure of singular points of smooth maps or algebraic varieties. Such singularities arise as critical points of smooth maps from Rm to Rn. The geometry near a critical point of such a map <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by an element of πmminus&1(S'nminus&1), by considering {{the way in which}} a small m minus& 1 sphere around the critical point maps into a topological n minus& 1 sphere around the critical value.|$|E
5|$|The {{substitution}} method for both P2 and P3 tilings <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> using Robinson triangles of different sizes. The Robinson triangles arising in P2 tilings (by bisecting kites and darts) are called A-tiles, while those arising in the P3 tilings (by bisecting rhombs) are called B-tiles. The smaller A-tile, denoted AS, is an obtuse Robinson triangle, while the larger A-tile, AL, is acute; in contrast, a smaller B-tile, denoted BS, is an acute Robinson triangle, while the larger B-tile, BL, is obtuse.|$|E
