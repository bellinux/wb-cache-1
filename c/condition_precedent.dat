5|$|The Court of Appeals {{held that}} Blacksmith could {{independently}} bring the claim for trespass, {{for which he}} need only show a right to possession. The Court of Appeals also held that Fellows' title was invalid, because the payment of compensation was a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent.</b> Welles, in dissent, agreed that Blacksmith could individually sue for trespass, but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent; he would have reversed and granted a new trial, with costs. The Court of Appeals remanded back to the Supreme Court, after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|An error as to a {{precedent}} fact, if committed, deprives the public authority {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, {{as the case may}} be, is a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in the}} United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was {{a precedent}} fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E
500|$|McHugh {{suggested}} that detention for a non-punitive purpose could still offend Chapter III if it prevented a court [...] "from determining some matter {{that is a}} <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> to authorising detention." [...] However, {{that was not the}} case here.|$|E
500|$|Before the New York Court of Appeals, Fellows was {{represented}} by J. C. Spencer, who made three arguments. First, {{he argued that the}} right to bring an action for trespass based on aboriginal title accrued only to an Indian nation, not an individual Indian. As Spencer noted, the Seneca Nation itself was prohibited by law from bringing an action [...] "by a private attorney." [...] Second, he argued that Fellows' title was valid. Third, he argued that the Seneca's rights under the treaty were only enforceable against the federal government, and did not affect the defendant's title as a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent.</b> The court reporter did not publish Martindale's responses.|$|E

50|$|Mrs. Fernandez {{moved to}} dismiss on three grounds. First she {{alleged that the}} oral {{agreement}} was barred by the Statute of Frauds, second that the agreement called upon Pando, a minor, to do an illegal act and is unenforceable, and third {{that it is impossible}} to prove in a court of law that the <b>conditions</b> <b>precedent</b> to the effectiveness of the contract had taken place.|$|R
500|$|The ratio decidendi, {{or legal}} {{point in the}} case which {{determined}} the judgment, was a narrow one. The appeals were allowed {{on the ground that}} the Minister had not discharged the burden of proving the validity of the detention orders. Under section 8(1) of the ISA, the President's satisfaction that a person poses a national security risk is a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> to the Minister's power to make a detention order. The Minister attempted to demonstrate that the President had been so satisfied before the detention order was made by pointing {{to the fact that the}} recitals in the detention orders stated that the President [...] "is satisfied", and by filing an affidavit by the Permanent Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs which asserted that the [...] "government" [...] was satisfied that the appellants were a danger to national security. However, the Court of Appeal found that this was inadmissible evidence as it amounted to hearsay. Furthermore, as regards the affidavit, the satisfaction of the Government was not the same as the President's satisfaction.|$|E
2500|$|For example, in Sumpter v Hedges {{a builder}} {{performed}} £333 worth of work, but then abandoned {{completion of the}} contract. The Court of Appeal held he could not recover any money for the building left on the land, even though the buyer subsequently used the foundations to complete the job. This rule provides a powerful remedy in home construction cases to a customer. So in Bolton v Mahadeva Mr Bolton installed a £560 heating system in Mahadeva's house. However, it leaked and would cost £174 to correct (i.e. 31% of the price). Mahadeva did not pay at all, and the Court of Appeal held this was lawful because the performance was so defective that there could {{not be said to}} be any substantial performance. However where an obligation in a contract is [...] "substantially performed", the full sum must be paid, only then deducting an amount to reflect the breach. So in Hoenig v Isaacs Denning LJ held a builder who installed a bookcase poorly, with a price of £750 but costing only £55 to correct (i.e. 7.3% of the price), had to be paid minus the cost of correction. If a contract's obligations are construed as consisting of an [...] "entire obligation", performance of it all will be a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> (a requirement before) to performance from the other side falling due, and allowing a breach of contract claim.|$|E
2500|$|Senior {{counsel for}} the {{applicant}} attacked the validity of par 12 of the Practice Note on two grounds. First it was put that at common law Royal Commissions have no coercive powers: McGuinness v Attorney-General for Victoria (1940) 63 CLR 73 at 98-99, Herald & Weekly Times Limited v Woodward [...] 1 VR 156 at 159. Any coercive powers must {{be found in the}} relevant statute under which the Royal Commission is established. Nothing in the Act compels the provision of a witness statement or its adoption in the witness box as prescribed in the Practice Note. It is impermissible to require, as a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> to the exercise of the right to cross-examine, the performance of an obligation which is beyond the power of the Commissioner to impose. Paragraph 12 of the Practice Note is an attempt by the Commissioner to do indirectly what he cannot do directly: Wragg v New South Wales (1953) 88 CLR 353 at 387-8, Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v Best (1990) 170 CLR 516 at 522. Further, it was said that the Commissioner did not have an unfettered discretion to grant or refuse leave to cross-examine. Secondly, it was put that the rules of natural justice may in some circumstances include the right to cross-examine a witness giving evidence adverse to a person affected. Paragraph 12 of the Practice Note was in absolute terms and applicable to all cross-examination, including cross-examination which was an exercise of rights conferred by the rules of natural justice.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} requirements that exist for an equitable assignment of property, outside the 'standard' clear and unconditional intention to assign. These requirements are fundamental {{characteristics of a}} statutory assignment: Absolute assignment (an unconditional transfer: <b>conditions</b> <b>precedent</b> or part of a debt are not absolute) and the assignment must {{be made in writing}} and signed by the assignor, and in particular, this applies to real property.|$|R
25|$|Contractual {{terms are}} {{classified}} differently {{depending upon the}} context or jurisdiction. Terms establish <b>conditions</b> <b>precedent.</b> English (but not necessarily non-English) common law distinguishes between important conditions and warranties, with a breach of a condition by one party allowing the other to repudiate and be discharged while a warranty allows for remedies and damages but not complete discharge. Whether or not a term is a condition is determined {{in part by the}} parties' intent.|$|R

60|$|But {{why this}} {{particular}} height {{rather than any}} other of the dozen that jut out into the plain? Well, there we get at another fundamental point in hill-top town history. Fiesole had water. A spring at such a height is comparatively rare, {{but it is a}} necessary accompaniment, or rather a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent,</b> of all high-place villages. In the Borgo Unto you will still find this spring--a natural fountain, the Fonte Sotterra--in an underground passage, now approached (so greatly did the Fiesolans appreciate its importance) by a Gothic archway. The water supplies the whole neighbourhood; and that accounts for the position of the town on the low col just below the acropolis.|$|E
60|$|The {{reader of}} Pope, as of every author, is advised {{to begin by}} letting him say {{what he has to}} say, in his own manner to an open mind that seeks only to receive the {{impressions}} which the writer wishes to convey. First let the mind and spirit of the writer come into free, full contact with the mind and spirit of the reader, whose attitude at the first reading should be simply receptive. Such reading is the <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> to all true judgment of a writer's work. All criticism that is not so grounded spreads as fog over a poet's page. Read, reader, for yourself, without once pausing to remember what you have been told to think.|$|E
6000|$|It would thus, {{in my view}} of the matter, be an {{inaccurate}} mode {{of expression}} to say, that obtaining appropriate conceptions is a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> to generalization.

As we obtain more knowledge of the phenomena themselves, and of the conditions on which their important properties depend, our views on this subject naturally alter; and thus we advance from a less to a more [...] "appropriate" [...] general conception, in the progress of our investigations.|$|E

25|$|There {{are certain}} <b>conditions</b> <b>precedent,</b> or defenses, to a {{recovery}} of damages for a person's failure to testify, or to provide documents pertinent to a hearing or trial. There {{must be a}} breach of testimonial duty, after having been properly served with a legitimately executed subpoena. There must be a demonstration of actual damages incurred from the absence of testimony. Most courts have rejected the arguments for seeking damages {{in this kind of}} case. Giving false testimony in a judicial proceeding even though the allegation is made that the person giving the testimony knew it to be false, does not give rise, either at common law or by statute, to a civil action for damages, resulting from such testimony. The situation is probably different if intentionally false documents are submitted under a subpoena duces tecum.|$|R
60|$|That {{which is}} true of the purely {{pastoral}} condition is a fortiori true of the purely agricultural* condition, in which the existence of the cultivator is directly dependent on the production of vital capital by the plants which he cultivates. Here, again, the <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> of the work of each year is vital capital. Suppose that a man lives exclusively upon the plants which he cultivates. It is obvious that he must have food-stuffs to live upon, while he prepares the soil for sowing and throughout the period which elapses between this and harvest. These food-stuffs must be yielded by the stock remaining over from former crops. The result is the same as before--the pre-existence of vital capital is the necessary antecedent of labour. Moreover, the amount of labour which contributes, as an accessory condition, to the production [160] of the crop varies as widely in the case of plant-raising as in that of cattle-raising. With favourable soil, climate and other conditions, it may be very small, with unfavourable, very great, for the same revenue or yield of food-stuffs.|$|E
60|$|Graham, in {{an admirable}} letter, truly {{worthy of a}} wise, affectionate, and {{faithful}} friend, said, 'My judgment is, on this occasion, balanced like your own.' He ran through the catalogue of Mr. Gladstone's most intimate political friends; {{the result was that}} he stood alone. Fixed party ties and active official duties would conduce to his present happiness and his future fame. He might form an intimate alliance with Lord Derby with perfect honour. His natural affinities were strong, and his 'honest liberal tendencies' would soon leaven the whole lump and bring it into conformity with the shape and body of the times. As for the leadership in the Commons, Graham had once thought that for Gladstone to sit on the treasury bench with Disraeli for his leader would be humiliation and dishonour. Later events had qualified this opinion. Of course, the abdication of Disraeli could not be made a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent,</b> but the concession would somehow be made, and in the Commons pre-eminence would be Gladstone's, be the conditions what they might. In fine, time was wearing fast away, Gladstone had reached the utmost vigour of his powers, and present opportunities were not to be neglected in vain expectation of better.|$|E
6000|$|Now I am {{not going}} to work this perhaps {{somewhat}} fanciful analogy to death, or pretend it is anything more than a convenient metaphor. Still, taken as such, it is not without its luminosity. For a metaphor, by supplying us with a picturable representation, often enables us really to get at the hang of the thing a vast deal better than the most solemn argument. And I fancy communities sometimes pass through just such a chrysalis stage, when it seems to the timid and pessimistic in their midst as if every component element of the State (but especially the one in which they themselves and their friends are particularly interested) were rushing violently down a steep place to eternal perdition. Chaos appears to be swallowing up everything. [...] "The natural relations of classes" [...] disappear. Faiths melt; churches dissolve; morals fade; bonds fail; a universal magma of emancipated opinion seems {{to take the place of}} old-established dogma. The squires and the parsons of the period--call them scribes or augurs--wring their hands in despair, and cry aloud that they don't know what the world is coming to. But, after all, it is only the chrysalis stage of a new system. The old social order must grow disjointed and chaotic before the new social order can begin to evolve from it. The establishment of a plastic consistency in the mass is the <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> of the higher development.|$|E

60|$|In {{the first}} place, no {{instinct}} is absolutely perfect. All of them necessarily fail at some points. If {{on the average}} they do good, they are sufficiently justified. Now the material with which {{you have to start}} in this case is not perfect. Each man marries, even in favourable circumstances, not the abstractly best adapted woman in the world to supplement or counteract his individual peculiarities, but the best woman then and there obtainable for him. The result is frequently far from perfect; all I claim is that it would be as bad or a good deal worse if somebody else made the choice for him, or if he made the choice himself on abstract biological and 'eugenic' principles. And, indeed, the very existence of better and worse in the world is a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> of all upward evolution. Without an overstocked world, with individual variations, some progressive, some retrograde, there could be no natural selection, no survival of the fittest. That is the chief besetting danger of cut-and-dried doctrinaire views. Malthus was a very great man; but if his principle of prudential restraint were fully carried out, the prudent would cease to reproduce their like, and the world would be peopled in a few generations by the hereditarily reckless and dissolute and imprudent. Even so, if eugenic principles were universally adopted, the chance of exceptional and elevated natures would be largely reduced, and natural selection would be in so much interfered with or sensibly retarded.|$|E
60|$|But, {{a little}} later, that growth of {{knowledge}} beyond imaginable utilitarian ends, {{which is the}} <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> of its practical utility, began to produce some effect upon practical life; and the operation of that part of nature we call human upon the rest began to create, not 'new natures,' in Bacon's sense, but a new Nature, the existence of which is dependent upon men's efforts, which is subservient to their wants, and which would disappear if man's shaping and guiding hand were withdrawn. Every mechanical artifice, every chemically pure substance employed in manufacture, every abnormally fertile race of plants, or rapidly growing and fattening breed of animals, {{is a part of}} the new Nature created by science. Without it, the most densely populated regions of modern Europe and America must retain their primitive, sparsely inhabited, agricultural or pastoral condition; it is the foundation of our wealth and the condition of our safety from submergence by another flood of barbarous hordes; it is the bond which unites into a solid political whole, regions larger than any empire of antiquity; it secures us from the recurrence of the pestilences and famines of former times; it is the source of endless comforts and conveniences, which are not mere luxuries, but conduce to physical and moral well-being. During the last fifty years, this new birth of time, this new Nature begotten by science upon fact, has pressed itself daily and hourly upon our attention, and has worked miracles which have modified the whole fashion of our lives.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{course this}} is {{perfectly}} true. I am afraid {{there is no}} man alive whose witness could be accepted, if the <b>condition</b> <b>precedent</b> were proof {{that he had never}} invented and promulgated a myth. In the minds of all of us there are little places here and there, like the indistinguishable spots on a rock which give foothold to moss or stonecrop; on which, if the germ of a myth fall, it is certain to grow, without in the least {344} degree affecting our accuracy or truthfulness elsewhere. Sir Walter Scott knew that he could not repeat a story without, as he said, [...] "giving it a new hat and stick." [...] Most of us differ from Sir Walter only in not knowing about this tendency of the mythopoeic faculty to break out unnoticed. But it is also perfectly true that the mythopoeic faculty is not equally active in all minds, nor in all regions and under all conditions of the same mind. David Hume was certainly not so liable to temptation as the Venerable Bede, or even as some recent historians who could be mentioned; and the most imaginative of debtors, if he owes five pounds, never makes an obligation to pay a hundred out of it. The rule of common sense is primâ facie to trust a witness in all matters in which neither his self-interest, his passions, his prejudices, nor that love of the marvellous, which is inherent to a greater or less degree in all mankind, are strongly concerned; and, when they are involved, to require corroborative evidence in exact proportion to the contravention of probability by the thing testified.|$|E
40|$|Virtually {{every action}} depends on some <b>conditions</b> <b>{{precedent}}.</b> Law is no exception. The common law and precedent involve reliance on earlier developments, as do more particularized phenomena like slippery slopes and path dependence.

Some commentators have raised concerns {{about the consequences of}} allowing bootstrapping, notably {{in the context of the}} individual mandate in the 2010 health care act. In this article I consider whether we, as citizens, should find bootstrapping, or a particular category of bootstrapping, particularly troubling. Bootstrapping is ubiquitous, so disallowing all bootstrapping by government actors would render the government unable to act. And I find that most possible distinctions are not useful. The one possible exception is a distinction between simultaneous and nonsimultaneous bootstrapping, as the former presents a situation in which the bootstrap is certain. Disfavoring simultaneous bootstrapping will do both too little (to the President) and too much (to Congress). I conclude that the costs of disfavoring some bootstrapping outweigh the benefits...|$|R
