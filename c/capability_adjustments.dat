50|$|Proxy Chaining is {{possible}} in RADIUS and authentication/authorization and accounting packets are usually routed between a NAS Device and a Home server {{through a series of}} proxies. Some of advantages of using Proxy chains include scalability improvements, policy implementations and <b>capability</b> <b>adjustments.</b> But in roaming scenarios, the NAS, Proxies and Home Server could be typically managed by different administrative entities. Hence, the trust factor among the proxies gains more significance under such Inter-domain applications. Further, the absence of end to end security in RADIUS adds to the criticality of trust among the Proxies involved. Proxy Chains are explained in RFC 2607.|$|E

50|$|The {{climate in}} Maine results in severe icing of the antenna wires during the winter, {{resulting}} in unacceptably large loads on the supporting structures. Therefore the antennas have a deicing system which runs large 60 Hz electric currents through the wires, heating them, to melt the ice. The power required for deicing is 3 MW, {{higher than the}} transmitter output power. An antenna array cannot transmit while it is being deiced, and one reason for having two arrays was to allow one array to be deiced while the other provides crucial uninterrupted transmission <b>capability.</b> Repairs and <b>adjustments</b> to an array can also be made without interrupting transmission.|$|R

An all-reflecting two-mirror star image motion compensator maintains both a flat focal plane and image focus for one or more star images. Both theoretical and experimental evaluations show that only one adjustment is needed to aline the system since the change in focus is linearly related to the misalinements of all critical components.
