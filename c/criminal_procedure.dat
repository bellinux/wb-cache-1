5|$|Petit {{jury and}} venue provisionsboth {{traceable}} to enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independenceare included in Article Three of the United States Constitution. More <b>criminal</b> <b>procedure</b> provisions {{are contained in}} the United States Bill of Rights, specifically the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments. With {{the exception of the}} Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and (maybe) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment, all of the <b>criminal</b> <b>procedure</b> provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to apply to the state governments.|$|E
5|$|The Vicinage clause has {{its roots}} in medieval English <b>criminal</b> <b>procedure,</b> the {{perceived}} abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution.

In search of support, Paraná {{went as far as}} to aid Liberal candidates in the 1854 provincial elections. The opposition by most saquaremas to this judicial reform was so fierce that a year later, Paraná (who had been raised from Viscount to Marquis in late 1854) backed down and implicitly withdrew the bill.|$|E

5|$|The Clause {{has led to}} {{very little}} litigation, {{in part because of}} its overlap (as a {{practical}} matter) with the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of <b>Criminal</b> <b>Procedure.</b> Further, {{with the exception of the}} District of Wyoming, which includes the portions of Yellowstone National Park in Idaho and Montana, no federal judicial district includes the territory of two or more states (although the short-lived District of Potomac once did).|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States issued {{almost no}} {{constitutional}} <b>criminal</b> <b>procedure</b> decisions {{for its first}} century of existence. Professor Akhil Amar highlights two reasons for this. First, the Court's decision in Barron v. Baltimore (1833) meant that the federal constitution did not apply in state proceedings until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases until 1891.|$|E
5|$|The current Saudi {{court system}} {{was created by}} King Abdul Aziz, who founded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, and was {{introduced}} to the country in stages between 1927 and 1960. It comprises general and summary Sharia courts, with some administrative tribunals to deal with disputes on specific modern regulations. Trials in Saudi Arabia are bench trials. Courts in Saudi Arabia observe few formalities and the country's first <b>criminal</b> <b>procedure</b> code, issued in 2001, has been largely ignored. King Abdullah, in 2007, introduced a number of significant judicial reforms, although they are yet to be fully implemented.|$|E
5000|$|Legal reform {{became a}} {{government}} {{priority in the}} 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the <b>criminal</b> <b>procedures</b> laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of [...] "counter-revolutionary" [...] activity (and references to [...] "counter-revolutionaries" [...] disappeared {{with the passing of}} the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while <b>criminal</b> <b>procedures</b> reforms encouraged establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.|$|R

5|$|Human Rights Watch, {{in their}} 2008 report on Saudi Arabian {{criminal}} justice system, {{noted that the}} <b>criminal</b> <b>procedure</b> code introduced in 2002 lacked some basic protections but, as mentioned above, had been ignored by judges in any case. Those arrested are often not informed {{of the crime of}} which they are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess. At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret, that is, without the public or press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1967 {{at his own}} trial Bukovsky {{used his}} final words to attack the regime's failure to respect the law or follow legal procedures.

He further suggested that the prosecution had repeatedly failed to observe the revised 1961 Code of <b>Criminal</b> <b>Procedure</b> in its conduct of the case. Bukovsky's final words in court circulated widely in a samizdat collection of such addresses {{and as part of}} a collection of materials about the demonstration and subsequent trials compiled by Pavel Litvinov.|$|E
