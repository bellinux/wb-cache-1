Crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals).

Bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage from salt <b>crystallisation,</b> as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the chlorides that had penetrated the surface.

5|$|For {{several years}} in the 1950s and 1960s, a {{by-product}} of the potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium while the rest was potassium and {{a small fraction of}} caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium, for example the Tanco Mine in Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as by-product from pollucite. Today, a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the fractional <b>crystallisation</b> of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O, which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 recrystallisations. The limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limit the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Caesium, however, is not produced from the above reaction. Instead, the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium, extracted from the ore mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction. Both metals are produced as by-products of lithium production: after 1958, when interest in lithium's thermonuclear properties increased sharply, the production of rubidium and caesium also increased correspondingly. Pure rubidium and caesium metals are produced by reducing their chlorides with calcium metal at 750°C and low pressure.|$|E

40|$|The work {{addresses}} {{the effect of}} the particle size of a bioactive glass feedstock on the processing and microstructure of the resulting coatings obtained by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). It was observed that the reduction of particle size negatively affects the flowability of the powder. In addition the thermal behaviour (weight losses, glass transitions, <b>crystallisations,</b> etc.) also depended on the particle size of the glass powder. No coating was obtained with the coarser fractions (higher than 200 μm) due to their low melting degree in the plasma. For the intermediate fractions (200 – 63 μm) coatings were obtained but insufficient particle melting was produced. On the contrary, the finest fraction (< 63 μm) needed a fluidiser which enabled the samples to be sprayed.

40|$|In {{real life}} {{it is hard}} to {{distinguish}} between the two life processes, growth and differentiation. We cannot expect one measured parameter to represent only one aspect of vital quality. But for most parameters we can recognise emphases on one or more aspects of the vital quality concept. We made this prelimary classification both by thinking about the concept and by looking at the experimental results. Also the conventional parameters are interpreted {{as a result of these}} processes in a more holistic way than usual. We realise that various parameters all concerning the same aspect of our quality concept can show different levels of the aspect. To belong to the same aspect of the quality concept does not automatically mean that their correlation (see annex 14. 2) must be high. We still have to get a lot of more experience to validate the parameters’ character. Here we present our first research on this topic, including the unanswered questions and realise that more experimental series will bring more and more certainty. After this first project we cannot say which parameters are so similar that it makes the other redundant. Until now we learned something from every parameter to develop our quality concept.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to arrive}} at a new {{understanding}} of the Self by taking an existential-phenomenological-hermeneutic approach to critically analyse several conceptualisations of the Self developed during this century. Through the synthesis of their insights, we articulate our own necessary dimensions of a conceptualisation of Self. In the first chapter, we articulate the basic notions of phenomenology, existential phenomenology and hermeneutics, {{as well as some of}} their limitations, following which we synthesise their opposite emphases, which we express respectively as those of understanding and explanation, taking place in an overall activity of interpretation within the context of the existential-hermeneutic circle. This synthesis is taken as the basis for a larger one between psychology as a human science and psychology as a natural science. This constitutes an initial contribution of the thesis, from which we establish the selection and evaluation criteria for the ensuing analysis of the conceptualisations of Self. In the second chapter, we present each author's conceptualisation, followed by the critical analysis of its understanding and explanatory aspects. In the third chapter, we articulate the necessary dimensions of a conceptualisation of Self, where an embodied primordial Self, as a conscious-embodied-subject-in-relationship-to-a-world-which-it-interprets, is at the centre of a constellation of secondary Selves, themselves seen as habitual <b>crystallisations</b> of lived experience in the primordial Self's four interrelated dimensions of materiality, interrelationship, interpretation and affection.

25|$|The {{central section}} or upper {{sections}} of many large ultramafic intrusions are poorly layered, massive gabbro. This is because as the magma differentiates it reaches a composition favouring <b>crystallisation</b> {{of only two}} or three minerals; the magma may also have cooled by this stage sufficiently for the increasing viscosity of the magma to halt effective convection, or convection may stop or break up into inefficient small cells because the revervoir becomes too thin and flat.|$|E
25|$|Whilst the {{dominant}} process of layering is fractional <b>crystallisation,</b> layering can also {{result in a}} magma body through assimilation of the wall rocks. This will tend to increase the silica content of the melt, which will eventually prompt a mineral to reach the liquidus for that magma composition. Note also that assimilation of wall rocks takes considerable thermal energy, so this process {{goes hand in hand}} with the natural cooling of the magma body. Often, assimilation can only be proven by detailed geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Crystallisation</b> {{experiments}} of galectins {{in complex}} with N-acetyllactosamine show that binding arises due to hydrogen bonding interactions from the carbon-4 and carbon-6 hydroxyl groups of galactose and carbon-3 of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) {{to the side}} chains of amino acids in the protein. They cannot bind to other sugars such as mannose because this sugar will not fit inside the carbohydrate recognition domain without steric hindrance. Due {{to the nature of}} the binding pocket, galectins can bind terminal sugars or internal sugars within a glycan. This allows bridging between two ligands on the same cell or between two ligands on different cells.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} a case study, a history, of -a magazine, Partisan Review, {{over a period of}} twenty years (1934 - 1954) treating it as a series of texts together constituting a transforming discourse. A discourse constructed in and against a discourse of Americanism, itself constructed through an interplay with representations of Europe. Partisan Review was initiated in 1934 within the institutional and intellectual framework of the American Communist Party as an organ of the John Reed Club. In 1937 formal links with the Communist Party were severed and the magazine reappeared as nominally independent but with clear Trotskyist sympathies. After a period of non-alignment without any explicit political programme, an editorial in 1952 declared a neo- Liberal and anti-communist support for "Our Country and Our Culture". It is asserted that these shifts did not constitute radical breaks, but were constructed gradually. The thesis attempts to make the discourse and its process of transformation intelligible to the reader by mapping the emergence and inter-relations of key concepts (including Aestheticism, Alienation, National, Intellectual, Science.) It is argued that each concept or element was defined both by its opposition to an antithetical concept and its place in the discourse - by the specific combination or articulation of the elements. Three editorial texts from 1937, 1941 and 1952, are taken as exemplars, momentary <b>crystallisations</b> of this transformatory practice, and each is subjected to an analysis which attempts to unpick and to gloss its changing component elements and the transforming articulations between elements...|$|R

At Curie's lab, Gleditsch performed a technique called fractional <b>crystallisations,</b> which purified radium. The work, which was highly specialized and few could complete, allowed her laboratory fees to be waived. She spent five years of analysis with Curie and returned even after leaving the lab to supervise experiments. In 1911, she received a [...] "Licenciée en sciences degree" [...] from the Sorbonne and was awarded a teaching post at University of Oslo.

She went anyway and despite having been rejected was able to work at the laboratory of Bertram Boltwood at Yale University, where she measured the half-life of radium, creating a standard measurement that was used for many years. One of the scientists who had originally turned her away from Yale, co-authored two articles with her and in June 1914, Smith College awarded her an honorary doctorate for her work. In 1913-14, she returned to the University of Oslo and became the second woman to be elected to Oslo‘s Academy of Science in 1917.

40|$|The {{end of the}} post-World War II ‘long boom’ in the mid- 1970 s {{proved the}} {{beginning}} of a process of political-economic change that has fundamentally transformed Australian labour law. Given the centrality of labour law to the production/reproduction of the commodity labour-power and the class struggle, the dramatic changes in labour law are a matter of tremendous importance, particularly for organised labour, which has found itself operating in an ever more hostile legal climate. However, the nature of labour law change in Australia remains poorly theorised. The traditional disciplines of labour law and industrial relations are primarily beholden to empiricist methods, whilst work on Australian political economy has typically paid scant attention to the issue of law beyond the descriptive account that neoliberalism has been associated with legal change. The result is a lack of a theoretically rigorous account of the evolution of Australian labour law. It is in to this lacuna that this thesis steps. Utilising the methodology of the Parisian Regulation Approach (PRA), I periodise Australian capitalism since World War II into two models of development, which are historically specific <b>crystallisations</b> of capitalist social relations unifying an industrial paradigm, accumulation regime and mode of regulation. The ability of the PRA to explain the role of a labour law regime within these models of development is crucially buttressed by its synthesis with a Marxist jurisprudence I have constructed, drawing upon the best work of scholars in this field. In particular, I argue that law is best conceived as a juridic form of capitalist production and exchange relations, rather than as a fundamentally a-capitalist institution determined by an economic base. Such a construction allows us to appreciate that law not only performs certain functions within a model of development, but also helps constitute its physiology and character...|$|R
