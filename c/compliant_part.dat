40|$|The {{deformation}} of <b>compliant</b> <b>parts</b> during material handling {{is a critical}} issue that can significantly affect the productivity and the parts' dimensional quality. There are multiple relevant aspects to consider when designing end-effectors to handle <b>compliant</b> <b>parts,</b> e. g. motion planning, holding force, part deformations, collisions, etc. This paper focuses on multi-robot material handling systems where the end-effector designs influence the coordination of the robots to prevent that these collide in the shared workspace. A multi-disciplinary methodology for end-effector design optimisation and multi-robot motion planning for material handling of <b>compliant</b> <b>parts</b> is proposed. The novelty is the co-adaptive optimisation of the end-effectors' structure with the robot motion planning to obtain the highest productivity and to avoid excessive part deformations. Based on FEA, the dynamic deformations of the parts are modelled in order to consider these during the collision avoidance between the handled parts and obstacles. The proposed methodology is evaluated for a case study that considers the multi-robot material handling of sheet metal parts in a multi-stage tandem press line. The results show that a substantial improvement in productivity can be achieved (up to 1. 9 %). These also demonstrate the need and contribution of the proposed methodology.

40|$|In high {{precision}} equipment {{the use of}} compliant mechanisms is favourable as elastic joints offer the advantages of low friction and no backlash. To satisfy exact constraint design the mechanism should have exactly the required degrees of freedom and constraints so {{that the system is}} kinematically and statically determinate. For this purpose we propose the following kinematic analysis using a flexible multibody modelling approach. In compliant mechanisms the system’s degrees of freedom are presented clearly from the analysis of a system in which the <b>compliant</b> <b>part</b> are free to deform while the support is considered rigid. If the Jacobian matrix associated with the dependent coordinates is not full column or row rank, the system is underconstraint or overconstraint. The rank of this matrix is calculated from a singular value decomposition. For an underconstraint system any motion in the mechanism that is not accounted for by the current set of degrees of freedom is visualised using data from the left singular matrix. For an overconstraint system a statically indeterminate stress distribution is derived from the right singular matrix and is used to visualise the overconstraints. In the next step of the mechatronic design the system’s closed-loop stability and performance are considered.

40|$|AbstractUnlike the {{metrology}} of rigid parts, no {{viable and}} industrial solutions {{in the case}} of non-rigid parts are available. Due to gravity load and residual stress, non-rigid parts (flexible, compliant) may have in a Free State condition a significant different shape than their corresponding nominal geometry (CAD model). As a result, very expensive and specialized fixtures mounting are needed by the industry to constrain the component during the inspection. Dealing with this real industrial problem, this paper proposes a new method to inspect non-rigid parts without these specialized fixtures. In this method, the CAD model is smoothly modified to fit the scanned part respecting two criteria that belong to non-rigid parts. The first criterion is the isometric transformation (or the condition that stretch should be very small) between the original CAD model and the modified one. The second criterion is the Euclidian distance between the modified CAD model and its corresponding scanned part. The proposed approach consists of adapting the Coherent Point Drift powerful non rigid registration method to meet the specifications of non-rigid parts. In other words, by minimizing the two above criteria, the paper proposes a ‘flexible’ registration to align the scanned manufactured <b>compliant</b> <b>part</b> to its nominal model in order to compare them and to deliver an inspection report. Satisfying results were obtained when validating the proposed method on a case study taken from the aerospace industry.

40|$|Dimensional {{variation}} {{is one of}} the most critical issues in the design of assembled products.

It combines the use of principal component analysis (PCA) and finite element analysis in estimating the effect of part/component variation on assembly variation. PCA is used to extract deformation patterns from production data, decomposing the component covariance into the individual contributions of these deformation patterns. Finite element analysis is used to determine the effect of each deformation pattern over the assembly variation.

40|$|Predicting {{the final}} shape {{variation}} of single and multi-station assemblies of <b>compliant</b> <b>parts</b> is a strategic topic especially in automotive and aeronautic industries for the wide-spread presence of sheetmetal assembly processes. The high flexibility of <b>compliant</b> <b>parts</b> causes wide final shape variations during the assembly process. Therefore, it is strategic to analyze different assembly configurations {{at the beginning}} of the design phase. Starting from the recent methodology proposed by the same authors in a previous paper to do tolerance/variation analysis of compliant assemblies in single- and multi-station configurations, the developed MATLAB-based tool, called SVA-FEA (Statistical Variation Analysis & Finite Element Analysis), is here briefly illustrated. SVA-FEA allows to pre-process FE models, imported from MSC. Patran® or HyperMesh®, defining input deviations and output variables, and including contacts between parts. Then, the results obtained with a linearization process by the MSC. Nastran® solver can be post-processed to evaluate the statistical variations - in term of mean and standard deviations - of all the points of interest.

40|$|FoF 1 -ATPase is a {{rotary motor}} protein synthesizing ATP from ADP {{driven by a}} cross-membrane proton gradient. The proton flow through the membrane-embedded Fo generates the rotary torque that drives the {{rotation}} of the asymmetric shaft of F 1. Mechanical energy of the rotating shaft is used by the F 1 catalytic subunit to synthesize ATP. It was suggested that elastic power transmission with transient storage of energy in some <b>compliant</b> <b>part</b> of the shaft is required for the observed high turnover rate. We used atomistic simulations to study the spatial distribution and structural determinants of the F 1 torsional elasticity at the molecular level and to comprehensively characterize the elastic properties of F 1 -ATPase. Our fluctuation analysis revealed an unexpected heterogeneity of the F 1 shaft elasticity. Further, we found that the measured overall torsional moduli of the shaft arise from two distinct contributions, the intrinsic elasticity and the effective potential imposed on the shaft by the catalytic subunit. Separation of these two contributions provided a quantitative description of the coupling between the rotor and the catalytic subunit. This description enabled us to propose a minimal quantitative model of the F 1 energetics along the rotary degrees of freedom near the resting state observed in the crystal structures.

40|$|As robots {{become more}} {{prevalent}} in smaller manufacturing and maintenance settings, it will become important {{to enable them to}} learn new tasks quickly without explicit programming by a human. One particularly challenging domain in robot learning is handling nonrigid objects and materials such as fluids and easily deformable parts and tools. The complexities of modeling nonrigid systems make it infeasible in general for a robot to plan its actions to perform a task by simulating their behavior, requiring an ability to learn an unknown model through experience. This experience can be gained both from a human demonstrating the way to perform a task and the robot itself performing task attempts to incrementally improve its model. Over time, as more experience is acquired, the robot should eventually obtain a model that allows it to perform the task when faced with new variations, generalizing its past experience. This dissertation explores this problem in the context of two robot tasks: pouring a specific volume of fluid into a moving container, and cleaning stains off of compliant objects. First, an approach is presented to learn the parameters of the pouring task by observing human demonstrations. The model learned from the demonstrations can then be exploited to learn how to pour new volumes with minimal extra learning effort by the robot. Second, this same task is used in development of a general approach for autonomous learning. Here, the robot takes a small set of random samples from the parameter space to build an initial task model and selects new parameters to test by building many local linear models. As more data is acquired, the robot's task performance improves substantially and it is able to very quickly find solutions to new task variations. Then another approach is shown that uses demonstrations to estimate a cost function for performing the task. This enables the robot to also learn strategy elements from how humans perform tasks. Finally, two approaches are discussed to learn the deformation model of a <b>compliant</b> <b>part.</b> A bimanual setup with two robot arms is used to hold and clean the part and the model is used to optimize the plans for both arms to reduce cleaning time and deformations. The first approach shows a black-box learning method to directly predict the part deformation when a known force is applied. The second uses a finite-element structure to represent the part, and learns the model by updating the stiffness parameters. When given a new part, the system only needs a few trials to improve quickly enough to clean new stains efficiently by predicting how much the part will deform under cleaning force...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{competitive}} market demands frequent change in product variety, increased production volume and shorten product/process change over time. These market requirements point towards development of key enabling technologies (KETs) to shorten product and process development cycle, improved production quality and reduced time-to-launch. One {{of the critical}} prerequisite to develop the aforementioned KETs is efficient and accurate modelling of product and process dimensional errors. It is especially critical for assembly processes with compliant parts as used in automotive body, appliance or wing and fuselage assemblies. Currently, the assembly process is designed under the assumption of ideal (nominal) products and then check by using variation simulation analysis (VSA). However, the VSA simulations are oversimplified as {{they are unable to}} accurately model or predict the effects of geometric and dimensional variations of compliant parts, as well as variations of key characteristics related to fixturing and joining process. This results in product failures and/or reduced quality due to un-modelled interactions in assembly process. Therefore, modelling and prediction of the geometric shape errors of complex sheet metal parts are of tremendous importance for many industrial applications. Further, as production yield and product quality are determined for production volume of real parts, thus not only shape errors but also shape variation model is required for robust assembly system development. Currently, parts shape variation can be measured during production by using recently introduced non-contact gauges which are fast, in-line and can capture entire part surface information. However, current applications of non-contact scanners are limited to single part inspection or reverse engineering applications and cannot be used for monitoring and statistical process control of shape variation. Further, the product shape variation can be reduced through appropriate assembly fixture design. Current approaches for assembly fixture design seldom consider shape variation of production parts during assembly process which result in poor quality and yield. To address the aforementioned challenges, this thesis proposes the following two enablers focused on modelling of shape errors and shape variation of compliant parts applicable during assembly process design phase as well as production phase: (i) modelling and characterisation of shape errors of individual <b>compliant</b> <b>part</b> with capabilities to quantify fabrication errors at part level; and (ii) modelling and characterisation of shape variation of a batch of compliant parts with capabilities to quantify the shape variation at production level. The first enabler focuses on shape errors modelling and characterisation which includes developing a functional data analysis model for identification and characterisation of real part shape errors that can link design (CAD model) with manufacturing (shape errors). A new functional data analysis model, named Geometric Modal Analysis (GMA), is proposed to extract dominant shape error xixmodes from the fabricated part measurement data. This model is used to decompose shape errors of 3 D sheet metal part into orthogonal shape error modes which can be used for product and process interactions. Further, the enabler can be used for statistical process control to monitor shape quality; fabrication process mapping and diagnosis; geometric dimensioning and tolerancing simulation with free form shape errors; or compact storage of shape information. The second enabler aims to model and characterise shape variation of a batch of compliant parts by extending the GMA approach. The developed functional model called Statistical Geometric Modal Analysis (SGMA) represents the statistical shape variation through modal characteristics and quantifies shape variation of a batch of sheet metal parts a single or a few composite parts. The composite part(s) represent major error modes induced by the production process. The SGMA model, further, can be utilised for assembly fixture optimisation, tolerance analysis and synthesis. Further, these two enablers can be applied for monitoring and reduction of shape variation from assembly process by developing: (a) efficient statistical process control technique (based on enabler ‘i’) to monitor part shape variation utilising the surface information captured using non-contact scanners; and (b) efficient assembly fixture layout optimisation technique (based on enabler ‘ii’) to obtain improved quality products considering shape variation of production parts. Therefore, this thesis proposes the following two applications: The first application focuses on statistical process control of part shape variation using surface data captured by in-process or off-line scanners as Cloud-of-Points (CoPs). The methodology involves obtaining reduced set of statistically uncorrelated and independent variables from CoPs (utilising GMA method) which are then used to develop integrated single bivariate T 2 -Q monitoring chart. The joint probability density estimation using non-parametric Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) has enhanced sensitivity to detect part shape variation. The control chart helps speedy detection of part shape errors including global or local shape defects. The second application determines optimal fixture layout considering production batch of compliant sheet metal parts. Fixtures control the position and orientation of parts in an assembly process and thus significantly contribute to process capability that determines production yield and product quality. A new approach is proposed to improve the probability of joining feasibility index by determining an N- 2 - 1 fixture layout optimised for a production batch. The SGMA method has been utilised for fixture layout optimisation considering a batch of compliant sheet metal parts. All the above developed methodologies have been validated and verified with industrial case studies of automotive sheet metal door assembly process. Further, they are compared with state-of-the-art methodologies to highlight the boarder impact of the research work to meet the increasing market requirements such as improved in-line quality and increased productivity...|$|E

Since most current computer-aided design (CAD) and Variation Simulation Analysis (VSA) systems are based on ideally sized, ideally located rigid or compliant geometry, {{they are unable to}} accurately model or predict the effects of variations in parts, fixturing and joining. This results in product failures due to un-modelled interactions between Key Product Characteristics (KPCs) of parts/assemblies and Key Control Characteristics (KCCs) of assembly process.

A literature review on 3 – 6 DoF compliant stages, static balancing strategies and statically balanced compliant mechanisms (SBCMs) has been performed. A classification from the inventory has been made and followed up by discussion. An obviously superior architecture for a 6 DoF compliant stage was not found. All the 6 DoF stages are either non-statically balanced compliant structures or statically balanced non compliant structures. The statically balanced non-compliant structures can be transformed into compliant structures using lumped compliance, while all SBCMs had distributed compliance. A 6 DoF SBCS is a great scope for improvements in precision engineering stages. BioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Free-form nonrigid parts {{form the}} {{substance}} of today’s automotive and aerospace industries. These parts have different shapes in free state due to their dimensional and geometric variations, gravity and residual strains. For the geometric inspection of such <b>compliant</b> <b>parts,</b> special inspection fixtures, in combination with coordinate measuring systems (CMM) and/or optical data acquisition devices (scanners) are used. This inevitably causes additional costs and delays that result in a lack of competitiveness in the industry. The goal of this thesis is to facilitate the dimensional and geometrical inspection of flexible components from a point cloud without using a jig or secondary conformation operation. More specifically, we aim to develop a methodology to localize and quantify the profile defects {{in the case of}} thin shells which are typical to the aerospace and automotive industries. The presented methodology is {{based on the fact that}} the interpoint geodesic distance between any two points of a shape remains unchangeable during an isometric deformation. This study elaborates on the theory and general methods for the metrology of nonrigid parts. We have developed a Generalized Numerical Inspection Fixture (GNIF), a robust methodology which merges existing technologies in metric and computational geometry, nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, and finite element methods to introduce a general approach to the fixtureless geometrical inspection of nonrigid parts...|$|R
40|$|The cumulus cell-oocyte complex (COC) matrix is an {{extended}} coat that forms around the oocyte {{a few hours}} before ovulation and plays vital roles in oocyte biology. Here, we analyzed the micromechanical response of mouse COC matrix by colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy. We found that the COC matrix is elastic insofar as it does not flow and its original shape is restored after force release. At the same time, the COC matrix is extremely soft. Specifically, the most <b>compliant</b> <b>parts</b> of in vivo and in vitro expanded COC matrices yielded Young’s modulus values of 0. 5 ± 0. 1 Pa and 1. 6 ± 0. 3 Pa, respectively, suggesting both high porosity and a large mesh size (≥ 100 nm). In addition, the elastic modulus increased progressively with indentation. Furthermore, using optical microscopy to correlate these mechanical properties with ultrastructure, we discovered that the COC is surrounded by a thick matrix shell that is essentially devoid of cumulus cells and is enhanced upon COC expansion in vivo. We propose that the pronounced nonlinear elastic behavior of the COC matrix is a consequence of structural heterogeneity and serves important functions in biological processes such as oocyte transport in the oviduct and sperm penetration...|$|R

40|$|Locating schemes, used to {{position}} parts during manufacturing, are usually designed {{in such a}} way that the response from the system is minimized. This implies that the position of the fasteners and/or welds are known in an assembly. Today there exist numerous of methods aiming to find an optimal set of locating points to increase the stability of an assembly, for both rigid and <b>compliant</b> <b>parts.</b> However, various industrial applications use surface-to-surface contacts to constrain certain degrees of freedom. This can lead to designs sensitive to geometric and load variations. As the complexity of the surfaces increases, difficulties of allocating geometric tolerances arise. An approach to control this is to keep the contact locations statistically stable. In this paper a methodology is presented where the First-Order reliability Method (FORM) is applied for numerical data, retrieved through Finite Element Analysis (FEA), to ensure that statistically stable contact location are achieved for two bodies with surface-to-suface contact. The FEA data represents how much of the total stress that lies within a given area, sW. The data is continuous and therefore it is assumed that the gradient can be calculated numerically with small steps. The objective function is to maximize sW for n variables. The data set is simulated through Finite Element Analysis using the commercial software Ansys and the results is illustrated on a case study from the machining industry...|$|R
40|$|Seismic {{velocities}} in {{rocks at}} ultrasonic frequencies depend {{not only on}} the degree of saturation but also on the distribution of the fluid phase at various scales within the pore space. Two scales of saturation heterogeneity are important: (1) saturation differences between thin compliant pores and larger stiffer pores, and (2) differences between saturated patches and undersaturated patches at a scale much larger than any pore. We propose a formalism for predicting the range of velocities in partially saturated rocks that avoids assuming idealized pore shapes by using measured dry rock velocity versus pressure and dry rock porosity versus pressure. The pressure dependence contains all of the necessary information about the distribution of pore compliances for estimating effects of saturation at the finest scales where small amounts of fluid in the thinnest, most <b>compliant</b> <b>parts</b> of the pore space stiffen the rock in both compression and shear (increasing both P- and S-wave velocities) in approximately the same way that confining pressure stiffens the rock by closing the compliant pores. Large-scale saturation patches tend to increase only the high-frequency bulk modulus by amounts roughly proportional to the saturation. The pore-scale effects will be most important at laboratory and logging frequencies when pore-scale pore pressure gradients are unrelaxed. The patchysaturation effects can persist even at seismic field frequencies if the patch sizes are sufficiently large and the diffusivities are sufficiently low for the larger-scale pressure gradients to be unrelaxed...|$|R
40|$|The {{assembly}} of <b>compliant,</b> non-rigid <b>parts</b> {{is widely used}} in automotive, aerospace, electronics, and appliance manufacturing. Dimensional variation is one important measure of quality in such assembly. This paper presents models for analyzing the propagation of dimensional variation in multi-stage compliant assembly systems {{and the use of}} such models for robust design and adaptive control of assembly quality. The models combine engineering structure analysis with advanced statistical methods in considering the effect part variation, tooling variation, as well as part deformation due to clamping, joining and springback. The new adaptive control algorithm makes use of the fine adjustment capabilities in new programmable tooling in achieving reduction of assembly variation.
