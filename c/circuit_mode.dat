5|$|Both {{versions}} of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games have three similar modes of gameplay: <b>Circuit</b> <b>mode,</b> Single Match, and Mission mode. <b>Circuit</b> <b>mode</b> is where players {{compete for the}} highest overall score in a pre-determined series of events or design their own circuit. In the Single Match, players can choose to compete in each event individually. Mission mode is a single-player option where each of the competitors has six character-specific missions to complete, although the characters' statistics are not as balanced as in the main game, making missions more difficult. The Wii version's Circuit and Single Match can have an additional one to three players competing simultaneously while its DS counterpart has an extra option dedicated to multiplayer called Versus Play. Versus supports up to four people to use the wireless capabilities of the Nintendo DS to play events. DS Download Play is possible for those without an individual copy of the game, however the number of sports available is limited to six events and <b>circuit</b> <b>mode</b> is not available.|$|E
5|$|Midtown Madness {{features}} 4 single-player modes: Blitz, Circuit, Checkpoint, and Cruise. In Blitz, {{the player}} must swing through 3 checkpoints {{and drive to}} the finish line within a time limit. The <b>Circuit</b> <b>mode</b> curtains off most of the city to resemble race tracks and pits the player against other cars. The Checkpoint mode combines the features of Blitz and Circuit has the player race against other cars to a destination—but also adds the complication of other traffic, such as police cars and pedestrians. In the Cruise mode, the player can simply explore the city at their own pace. All of these modes except Cruise are divided into missions; completing one unlocks the next. Environmental conditions that traverse all modes include weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy, and snowy), time of day (sunrise, afternoon, sunset, and night-time), and the density of pedestrians, traffic, and police vehicles. The heads-up display includes, alongside information about the race, a detailed map, but this display can be turned off.|$|E
500|$|Lego Racers {{gameplay}} {{received a}} mixed reaction from critics. Charla called creating and testing cars {{a lot of}} fun, especially because the way a car is built has [...] "a major effect on how it controls", and IGN's reviewer for the PC version found that unlocking new bricks in the <b>circuit</b> <b>mode</b> for use in car customization is addictive. However, Stahl called the game's construction system unfriendly, stating that the player is [...] "better off just sticking {{with one of the}} default vehicles". Imperio said that handling the cars is [...] "surprisingly tight", calling the N64 control scheme intuitive. Conversely, Charla found that most of the cars feel top-heavy, and stated that the racing is awful. IGN's reviewer for the PC version praised the power up system, calling it pretty cool, as well as stating that the Power Plus bricks add [...] "a new strategy to the game", but Stahl called the system [...] "terribly lame". Reviewers also criticised the game's multiplayer features, with IGN's PC reviewer calling the split screen mode simple, and an Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer stating that the [...] "lack of multiplayer options" [...] hurts Lego Racers replay value.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: With the {{introduction}} of high-speed traffic there is an increased consumption of traction current by new types of rolling stock. This issue is important, as high levels of traction currents can have not only prevents, but also a dangerous impact on the equipment of railway automation devices. It is necessary to investigate the propagation of traction currents and potentials along the rails. Objective: Investigate the propagation of traction currents and potentials along the rails, the determination of critical currents, which not executed tone track <b>circuits</b> <b>modes.</b> Methods: In order to investigate the mathematical model, and the method of calculation tone track <b>circuits</b> <b>modes</b> was used.

A comparative analysis of the experimental data {{and the results of}} the investigation has been realized. Based on received levels of reverse traction current their influence on track <b>circuit</b> <b>modes</b> has been investigated. Conclusions: The reverse traction current level near the substation and rolling-stock can be more than 600 A.
