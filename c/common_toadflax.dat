The embankments have colonised naturally and support yellow-wort, lady's bedstraw, ploughman's-spikenard, field scabious and marjoram.

50|$|Calophasia lunula is {{a species}} of noctuid moth known by the <b>common</b> names <b>{{toadflax}}</b> moth and toadflax brocade moth. It is used {{as an agent of}} biological pest control against yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris) and Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria genistifolia ssp. dalmatica) in areas where they are considered noxious weeds, such as in North America.|$|R
5000|$|The genus is {{native to}} {{southern}} Europe. It {{is closely related to}} the genera Linaria and Antirrhinum, differing in having creeping growth and flowers borne singly rather than in dense erect spikes. The <b>common</b> name <b>toadflax</b> is shared with Linaria and other related genera. The scientific name means [...] "resembling a cymbal" [...] for the somewhat rounded leaves.|$|R
50|$|Cymbalaria muralis, with <b>common</b> names ivy-leaved <b>toadflax,</b> Kenilworth ivy, coliseum ivy, Oxford ivy, {{mother of}} thousands, pennywort, {{wandering}} sailor, is a flowering plant native to Mediterranean Europe and widely naturalised elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|Linaria vulgaris (<b>common</b> <b>{{toadflax}},</b> yellow toadflax, or butter-and-eggs) is {{a species}} of toadflax (Linaria), native to most of Europe, northern Asia, the United Kingdom, Spain, east to eastern Siberia, and western China. It has also been introduced and is now common in North America.|$|E
50|$|The {{grassland}} flora {{is made up}} of a {{wide range}} of limestone-loving plants which include field scabious, lady's bedstraw, common bird's-foot-trefoil and oxeye daisy. Various colour-forms of greater knapweed may be found as well as common twayblade. Cowslips bloom in the spring. White campion, <b>common</b> <b>toadflax</b> and mouse-ear hawkweed are also supported. Common cornsalad may also be found which is becoming increasingly rare.|$|E
5000|$|The Antirrhineae are not {{noted as}} food- or fodder plants, {{probably}} due to the iridoid content making them less than palatable. However, the tribe does not seem to contain highly poisonous plants, either; rather, use in folk medicine has been documented for a few species. While e.g. <b>common</b> <b>toadflax</b> (Linaria vulgaris) is credited with a range of uses by European herbalists, as of the 2010s, little scientific study has been made and the traditionally attested medical properties of the Antirrhineae are by and large unremarkable by standards of the Plantaginaceae, which abound with species of major pharmacological interest. The chief human use of the present tribe is for the flowers, primarily as ornamental plants in gardening. Colloquially called [...] "the snapdragon", Antirrhinum majus is probably the single most widely known member of the Antirrhineae by far.|$|E
50|$|Penstemon linarioides is a {{plant species}} in the genus Penstemon. Its <b>common</b> names include <b>{{toadflax}}</b> penstemon, toadflax beardtongue and Colorado narrowleaf beardtongue. It grows in Nevada, Arizona , Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Linaria bipartita is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the plantain family known by the <b>common</b> name clovenlip <b>toadflax.</b> It is native to Morocco, {{but it can be}} found elsewhere as an introduced species and it is cultivated as an ornamental plant. It is an annual herb growing 10 to 30 centimeters tall with linear leaves 3 to 5 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a raceme of flowers occupying the top of the stem. The flower is about 2 centimeters long with five lobes arranged into two lips with a spur at the end. The flower is often reddish purple in color, but flowers of many different colors are bred for the garden. The fruit is a spherical capsule about 2 millimeters wide.|$|R
50|$|Linaria purpurea is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the plantain family known by the <b>common</b> name purple <b>toadflax.</b> It is native to Italy, {{but it can be}} found growing wild as an introduced species in parts of western North America, including California, western Washington, and British Columbia, and it is cultivated as an ornamental plant. It is a perennial herb growing 30 to 70 centimeters tall with linear leaves 2 to 5 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a raceme of flowers occupying the top of the stem. The flower is between 1 and 2 centimeters long with five lobes arranged into two lips with a spur at the end. The flower is usually light to medium purple in color. This plant is poisonous to livestock, the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera use this plant as a food source.|$|R
50|$|A. majus cultivars can today be {{encountered}} essentially {{anywhere between}} Earth's polar circles, whether grown {{in a range}} of sizes and colours by hobbyists or field-scale for sale as cut flowers. In the hottest parts of the globe, it dies after one flowering, and in arid regions, other species may be more important, but otherwise it is extremely adaptable, and in warm-temperate climates, individual plants may survive for several years. The readiness with which A. majus flower colour and shape mutate and can be crossbred has led to the establishments of unusual (e.g. peloric) cultivars, as well as to making this species one of the first model organisms of genetics and helping uniting the theories of Darwin and Mendel. It remains a key model organism today in fields such as plant developmental genetics. <b>Common</b> <b>toadflax</b> has become established as a model organism more recently; while it may be an invasive nuisance weed in agriculture, like other toadflaxes and snapdragons, its attractive flowers make it useful as a wildflower. At present however, the other members of this family are generally only of minor or localized interest.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{southern}} England, Linaria vulgaris (<b>common</b> yellow <b>toadflax)</b> {{suffers from}} {{high rates of}} nectar robbery by bumblebees. In a wild population of L. vulgaris we found that 96 % of open flowers were robbed. Five species of bumblebee were observed foraging on these flowers, although short-tongued species (Bombus lapidarius, B. lucorum and B. terrestris) robbed nectar whilst longer-tongued ones behaved as legitimate pollinators (B. hortorum and B. pascuorum). Nectar rewards were highly variable; on average there was less nectar in robbed than in unrobbed flowers, but this difference was not statistically significant. The proportion of flowers containing no nectar was significantly higher for robbed flowers compared with unrobbed flowers. Secondary robbers and legitimate pollinators had similar handling times on flowers and, assuming they select flowers at random to forage on, received approximately the same nectar profit per minute, largely because most flowers had been robbed. There {{was no significant difference}} in the number of seeds in pods of robbed flowers and in pods of flowers that were artificially protected against robbing. However, more of the robbed flowers set at least some seed than the unrobbed flowers, possibly as a consequence of the experimental manipulation. We suggest that nectar robbing has little effect on plant fecundity because legitimate foragers are present in the population, and that seed predation and seed abortion after fertilization may be more important factors in limiting seed production in this species. © 2000 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SA...|$|R
50|$|Linaria maroccana is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the plantain family known by the <b>common</b> names Moroccan <b>toadflax</b> and annual toadflax. It is native to Morocco, {{but it can be}} found elsewhere growing wild as an introduced species, such as California. It is a readily available ornamental plant for the flower garden. This is an annual herb growing erect to approach a maximum height of 50 cm, its stem with linear leaves 2 - 4 cm long. The inflorescence is a raceme of flowers occupying the top of the stem. At the base of each flower is a calyx with five narrow, pointed lobes. The flower is 2 - 4 cm long with five lobes arranged into two lips with a spur at the end. The flower is often purple in color with white near the throat, but flowers of many different colors are bred for the garden. Dwarf cultivars are also available.|$|R
