40|$|A cell {{boundary}} element method {{is used to}} solve the two-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equation for vortex-shedding flows around arrays of cylinders. The method is a hybrid scheme using a boundary element method in each fluid cell discretization with a finite element procedure to solve for the global fluid problem. Computations are presented of two-dimensional flow characteristics and interactive forces associated with flows around four equispaced cylinders of equal diameter, and two cylinders, one with circular cross-section and the other elliptical. It was found that behaviour such as in-phase vortex-shedding, anti-phase vortex shedding and synchronized vortex shedding, which are well-known <b>characteristics</b> <b>for</b> flows past <b>arrangements</b> of two circular cylinders, were also present in these more complicated flows.

Strategic Alliances and Vertical Coordination Vertical coordination encompasses many broad and varied methods of harmonizing or synchronizing farm-level supplies with retail-level demand. Vertical coordination via market prices with no attribute information is at one extreme of a continuum of vertical coordination methods, while vertical integration is at the other extreme. Between the two extremes are numerous vertical cooperation arrangements, including various types of contracts, joint ventures, cooperatives, partnerships, and alliances. Vertical cooperation is defined as the relationship between individual firms or organizations in two or more adjacent stages of the production-marketing channel without full ownership or control by individual firms (den Ouden et al.). This broad but useful definition seems applicable to vertical arrangements in the beef industry. In essence, vertical cooperation participants or partners fundamentally maintain their independence but share information to more effectively price products and improve the flow of products and information among the vertical production-marketing stages. This definition generally describes many of the alliances and vertical arrangements in the beef industry even though some organizations do not classify themselves as a strategic alliance. They might use cooperative, partnership, program, or another term to describe their organizational structure and operation. The term “strategic alliance ” is used here in a broad sense to encompass many types of vertical arrangements...|$|R

Tall and large spaces typically contain large fire loads {{that can lead}} to a rapid increase in temperatures during an accidental fire. Conventional {{fire suppression}} systems are not able to extinguish fires in tall and large atria. The water droplets distinguished from sprinkler systems can either be vaporized or carried away by the fire-induced hot air currents in tall and large spaces. In this thesis, the fundamental principles of rapid and effective fire extinguishment, the major findings and limitations of existing sprinkler systems widely used were identified first. A side-wall long-throw sprinkler system is then proposed. The characteristics of the system including their structure, flow coefficient, operating pressure, sprinkler head distance and installation height were then studied. The experimental portion of the study was started by establishing the key experiment parameters for the long-throw sprinkler, including the use of a 10 MW fire. Appropriate wood cribs were selected as the experimental fire in this study. The heat release rate <b>characteristics</b> <b>for</b> different <b>arrangements</b> of wood cribs with different numbers of wood cribs and placements were explored. Tests were conducted on the water distribution qualities of sprinklers in a hall with different installation heights of 6 m, 8 m and 10 m under operating pressures of 0. 2 MPa, 0. 35 MPa, and 0. 5 MPa respectively. The results were used to justify numerical simulations. Experimental results are then correlated with the most desirable water distribution <b>characteristics</b> <b>for</b> proposing design practices. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) was then used to study the performance of proposed side-wall long-throw sprinkler systems. Two sets of four scenarios on sprinkler fire were adopted for CFD-FDS simulation. The size distribution of water droplets, sprinkler flow effectiveness, sprinkler head design, fire extinguishing system activation time and heat transfer characteristics between smoke and sprinkler water droplets were studied. For medium hazard classes, sprinklers with flow coefficients 115 and 161, installation heights higher than 10 m and operating pressure of 0. 5 MPa are found to be appropriate for extinguishing fires. Full-scale experiments were conducted on sprinkler fire for justifying CFD-FDS predictions. Important technical requirements for designing sprinkler for tall and large halls are the proportion of large water droplets discharged from the sprinkler system reaching the fire. The concept of Actual Delivered Density and Required Delivered Density were applied to evaluate the performance of sprinkler systems. Results from full-scale experiments are consistent with those from the mathematical models. Department of Building Services EngineeringPh.

40|$|The Tai Hang Tung Storage Scheme (THTSS) is an {{essential}} component of the West Kowloon Drainage Improvement (Stage 2) Project that aims to solve the flooding problem in Mongkok - a congested and densely populated district of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region. Over the years rapid development and changes in land use have resulted in significant increases in surface stormwater runoff, and the existing drainage system failed to cope with severe rainstorms. Rather than digging up roads and widening/adding existing drains, an economic drainage improvement plan calls {{for the construction of a}} 100, 000 m 3 underground storage tank upstream of the flooding black spots, below an existing football field in the vicinity of the Tai Hang Tung-Tat Chee Road junction. The upstream storage can serve to attenuate peak floods and protect downstream areas from flooding. Due to the complicated flows in the stormwater drainage system (including subcritical and supercritical open channel flows, pressurized flow in closed conduit, side weir overflows, and transitional flows at junctions), a 1 : 22 undistorted Froude scale physical model was designed and constructed to study the feasibility and performance of the THTSS scheme. As a complement, a 1 D numerical model of the unsteady flow was developed to study water stages and flow <b>characteristics</b> <b>for</b> different side-weir <b>arrangements.</b> The key findings of the physical and numerical model studies are reported herein. The studies have resulted in an optimal design of the flood storage scheme; the physical model tests and numerical model results indicate that THTSS can enhance the flood control capacity to cope with a one in 50 -year rainstorm. © 2008 International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
