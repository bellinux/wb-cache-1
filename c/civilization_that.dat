5|$|Instead {{of playing}} {{as one of}} the {{standard}} civilizations, the player takes command of a special <b>civilization</b> <b>that</b> is linked to the character or period that each Act portrays. Most units of the player civilizations speak in English language, with the exception of unique units such as Spanish Rodeleros, Spanish Lancers, German Ulhans and German War Wagons.|$|E
5|$|Rand {{meets with}} the Seanchan, a <b>civilization</b> <b>that</b> invaded the {{continent}} {{earlier in the}} series. Their leader Tuon rejects Rand's offer of a truce after sensing a dark aura that emanated from Rand after he channeled the True Power. Following the meeting, Tuon declares herself Empress and prepares a surprise attack against the White Tower.|$|E
5|$|According to Tough, an {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might want}} to send various types of information to humanity by means of artifacts, such as an Encyclopædia Galactica, containing the wisdom of countless extraterrestrial cultures, or perhaps an invitation to engage in diplomacy with them. A <b>civilization</b> <b>that</b> sees itself {{on the brink of}} decline might use the abilities it still possesses to send probes throughout the galaxy, with its cultures, values, religions, sciences, technologies, and laws, so that they may not die along with their civilization.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Robotnik's space station, the Death Egg, crash-lands on {{a mystical}} {{floating}} landmass called Angel Island after Sonic and Tails defeat {{him at the}} end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. As Robotnik begins to repair the damaged station, he meets Knuckles the Echidna, the last surviving member of an ancient echidna <b>civilization</b> <b>that</b> once inhabited the island, as well as the guardian of the Master Emerald, which grants the island its levitation powers. Realizing Sonic and Tails will try to track him down, Robotnik dupes Knuckles into believing Sonic is trying to steal the Master Emerald, turning the two against each other while Robotnik tries to repair his space station.|$|E
5|$|John Ralston Saul {{expressed}} the view in The Unconscious <b>Civilization</b> <b>that</b> in contemporary developed nations {{many people have}} acquiesced in turning over their {{sense of right and}} wrong, their critical conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{exploratory}} {{parts of}} the game feature a series of arcane codes and glyphs, treasure maps and chests, and secret rooms. Players are left without guidance to determine whether game elements are decipherable subpuzzles or simply false signals. These sorts of puzzles include hidden warp gates, enigmatic obelisks, invisible platforms, sequences of tetrominos, a ciphered alphabet, and QR codes. One of the game's recurring themes is an ancient <b>civilization</b> <b>that</b> attempted {{to make sense of}} their dimensionality, as told through artifacts.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{of musical}} {{instruments}} in use by early civilizations of India is almost completely lacking, {{making it impossible}} to reliably attribute instruments to the Munda and Dravidian language-speaking cultures that first settled the area. Rather, the history of musical instruments in the area begins with the Indus Valley <b>Civilization</b> <b>that</b> emerged around 3000 BC. Various rattles and whistles found among excavated artifacts are the only physical evidence of musical instruments. A clay statuette indicates the use of drums, and examination of the Indus script has also revealed representations of vertical arched harps identical in design to those depicted in Sumerian artifacts. This discovery is among many indications that the Indus Valley and Sumerian cultures maintained cultural contact. Subsequent developments in musical instruments in India occurred with the Rigveda, or hymns. These songs used various drums, shell trumpets, harps, and flutes. Other prominent instruments in use during the early centuries AD were the snake charmer's double clarinet, bagpipes, barrel drums, cross flutes, and short lutes. In all, India had no unique musical instruments until the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|SETI {{researcher}} Carl Sagan {{believed that}} a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war {{to be able to}} avoid self-destruction. Representatives of such a civilization would treat humanity with dignity and respect, and humanity, with its relatively backward technology, would {{have no choice but to}} reciprocate. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer <b>civilization</b> <b>that</b> would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize humanity, much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E

25|$|The Ophidian alphabet, {{featured}} in , {{was used by}} the Ophidian <b>civilization</b> <b>that</b> inhabited the Serpent Isle. It is based on various snake forms. Ophidian lettering was quite difficult to read, so the game included a Translation spell that made the letters look like Latin letters.|$|E
25|$|I do {{not believe}} that the present sombre {{prospect}} in Turkey will be long permitted to offend the sight of Christendom.

40|$|As we {{discover}} numerous habitable planets around other {{stars in the}} Milky Way galaxy, including the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, one cannot help but wonder why have we not detected evidence for an advanced alien civilization as of yet. The surfaces of other planets might show either relics of advanced <b>civilizations</b> <b>that</b> destroyed themselves by self-inflicted catastrophes or living <b>civilizations</b> <b>that</b> are technologically primitive. Such circumstances can only be revealed by visiting those planets and not by remote observations. Comment: 3 pages, published in Scientific America...|$|R

25|$|Diplomacy is a {{key part}} of the game. Players — both human and AI — may trade technology, starbases, ships, planets, and trade goods (unique {{improvements}} built by one <b>civilization</b> <b>that</b> provide a bonus to those obtaining them). Negotiation skill is an important factor which varies with inherent civilization bonuses and research; it can be possible to gain a significant technological advantage through careful trading with less sophisticated civilizations.|$|E

25|$|The Kura–Araxes {{culture or}} the early trans-Caucasian culture was a <b>civilization</b> <b>that</b> existed from about 4000 BC until about 2000 BC, which has {{traditionally}} been regarded as the date of its end; in some locations it may have disappeared as early as 2600 or 2700 BC.

25|$|On Peter the Great's {{death in}} 1725, {{the city of}} Saint Petersburg was still {{far from being the}} centre of western culture and <b>civilization</b> <b>that</b> he had envisioned. Many of the aristocrats who had been {{compelled}} by the Tsar to inhabit Saint Petersburg left. Wolves roamed the squares at night while bands of discontented pressed serfs, imported to build the Tsar's new city and Baltic fleet, frequently rebelled.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, certain sects {{affiliated}} with the Black nationalist Moorish Science philosophy theorized an association with the Mound Builders. They argue that the Mound Builders were an ancient advanced Black <b>civilization</b> <b>that</b> developed the legendary continents of Atlantis and Mu, as well as ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica. These black groups claim that the American Indians were too primitive to have developed the sophisticated societies and the technology believed necessary to build the mounds.|$|E
