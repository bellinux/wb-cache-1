40|$|We {{present a}} study of the local {{magnetic}} properties of iron/iron oxide granular nanostructures by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). Metallic iron (alpha-Fe) nanoparticles, with average sizes ranging from 5 to 13 nm, are embedded in a nanocrystalline oxide matrix composed of both magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and maghemite (gamma-Fe 2 O 3). These granular samples were synthesized by <b>cold</b> <b>compacting</b> core-shell nanoparticles, in which a 2 – 3 nm-thick oxide layer surrounds the iron particles, synthesized by inert gas condensation. By exploiting the chemical selectivity and site sensitivity of XMCD, we were able to separate the magnetic contributions of the metallic core and of the two oxide phases present in the matrix and to study their behavior as a function of iron particle size and applied magnetic induction field.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} the effect of manufacturing conditions, especially milling time, on the microstructure and crystallite size of a newly developed nanostructural composite material with the aluminium alloy matrix reinforced with halloysite nanotubes. Halloysite, being a clayey mineral of volcanic origin, is characterized by high porosity and large specific surface area. Thus it can be used as an alternative reinforcement in metal matrix composite materials.
