5|$|The Swiss Confederation in Huldrych Zwingli's time {{consisted}} of thirteen states (<b>cantons)</b> {{as well as}} affiliated areas and common lordships. Unlike the modern state of Switzerland, which operates under a federal government, each of the thirteen <b>cantons</b> was nearly independent, conducting its own domestic and foreign affairs. Each canton formed its own alliances within and without the Confederation. This relative independence served {{as the basis for}} conflict {{during the time of the}} Reformation when the various <b>cantons</b> divided between different confessional camps. Military ambitions gained an additional impetus with the competition to acquire new territory and resources, as seen for example in the Old Zurich War of 1440–1446.|$|E

5|$|Rural {{and urban}} <b>cantons</b> {{had the same}} {{standing}} in the federation. Each canton was sovereign within its territory, pursuing its own foreign policy and also minting its own money. The diet and central council of the federation, the Tagsatzung, held no real power and served more {{as an instrument of}} coordination. The reformation in the early 16th century had led to a confessional division amongst the cantons: the central Swiss <b>cantons</b> including Lucerne had remained Catholic, while Zürich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and also the city of St. Gallen had become Protestant. The Tagsatzung was often paralysed by disagreements between the equally strong factions of the Catholic and Protestant sides.|$|E
5|$|The Reformation {{spread to}} other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several <b>cantons</b> resisted, preferring to remain Catholic. Zwingli formed an {{alliance}} of Reformed <b>cantons</b> which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war between the two sides was averted at the last moment. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of Martin Luther and other reformers.

5|$|Thus, {{while the}} rest of Europe saw revolutionary uprisings, the Swiss drew up a {{constitution}} which provided for a federal layout, much of it inspired by the American example. This constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the <b>cantons</b> the right to self-government on local issues. Giving credit to those who favoured the power of the <b>cantons</b> (the Sonderbund Kantone), the national assembly was divided between an upper house (the Council of States, two representatives per canton) and a lower house (the National Council, with representatives elected from across the country). Referendums were made mandatory for any amendment of this constitution. This new constitution also brought a legal end to nobility in Switzerland.|$|E
