5000|$|The [...] "implicit join notation" [...] simply {{lists the}} tables for joining, in the [...] {{clause of the}} [...] statement, using <b>commas</b> to <b>separate</b> them.

5000|$|This use {{originates}} with ALGOL 60, {{and falls}} between the comma ( [...] ,) - {{used as a}} list separator - and the period/full stop (.) - used to {{mark the end of}} the program. The semicolon, as a mark separating statements, corresponds to the ordinary English usage of separating independent clauses, and gives the entire program the gross syntax of a single ordinary sentence. Of these other characters, whereas commas have continued to be widely used in programming for lists (and rare other uses, such as the <b>comma</b> operator that <b>separates</b> expressions in C), they are rarely used otherwise, and the period {{as the end of the}} program has fallen out of use. The last major use of the comma, semicolon, and period hierarchy is in Erlang (1986), where <b>commas</b> <b>separate</b> expressions; semicolons separate clauses, both for control flow and for function clauses; and periods terminate statements, such as function definitions or module attributes, not the entire program. Drawbacks of having multiple different separators or terminators (compared to a single terminator and single grouping, as in semicolon-and-braces) include mental overhead in selecting punctuation, and overhead in rearranging code, as this requires not only moving lines around, but also updating the punctuation.|$|R
