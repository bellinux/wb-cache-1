However, because accounts of crop-raiding behaviour are frequently indirect, these parameters are rarely quantified or explicitly linked to crop damage. Using systematic {{observations of the}} behaviour of non-human primates on farms in western Uganda, this research identifies number of individuals raiding and duration of raid as the primary parameters determining <b>crop</b> <b>loss.</b> Secondary factors include distance travelled onto farm, age composition of the raiding group, and whether raids are in series.

5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where <b>crop</b> <b>losses</b> can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing {{this is the}} greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.|$|E

To determine yield reduction caused by this disease in Golestan province, field experiments were carried out in randomized complete block design with four replications and five wheat cvs. Tajan, Zagros, Shiroodi, Koohdasht, Shanghai and two lines N- 80 - 6 and N- 80 - 19 at Gorgan Research Station. Artificial inoculation was performed using spore suspension at three growth stages (Zadoks scale) including tillering (GS 37), stem elongation (GS 45) and flag leaf opening (GS 53). Control plots were sprayed with water. In this study, the 1 000 kernel weight (TKW), grain yield and area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) during growth season were measured. Statistical analysis showed that the levels of yield reduction was different in various studied wheat cultivars and lines and was reduced by 30 to 50 %. The highest losses were observed for cvs. Zagros and Tajan with 48. 86 % and 47. 41 % of grain yield reduc-tion, respectively.
