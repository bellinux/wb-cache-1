40|$|The {{performance}} of the satellite communication systems employing either polarization diversity or frequency-reuse schemes to improve the spectral efficiency is degraded due to the depolarization-induced interference originated by raindrops and ice particles present along the Earth-Satellite propagation path. Two models are able to account for both rain and ice contributions: one enables the prediction of the long-term first-order statistics (Cumulative Distribution Function, CDF) of cross-polarization discrimination (XPD), and the second enables the prediction {{of the relationship between}} XPD and <b>co-polar</b> <b>attenuation</b> (CPA). The second was developed considering exclusively data at V-band and so, it not only requires independent validation but also extension to other frequency-bands. The predictions provided by the first are usually converted on the corresponding XPD-CPA relationship using the long-term first-order statistics of rain attenuation, (incorrectly) considering that the equiprobability hypothesis applies. Using 8 years of measurements both models are tested, a new XPD-CPA relationship is proposed for the Ka-band and a novel approach to the conversion from the CDF of XPD to the corresponding XPD-CPA relationship is presented...|$|E
40|$|A medium-size Beacon Receiving System for {{reception}} and processing of the B 1 (20 GHz) and B 2 (30 GHz) beacons from Olympus has been developed. Integration of B 1 and B 2 receiving equipment into one system using one antenna {{and a common}} computer for control and data processing provides the advantages of a compact configuration and synchronization of the two receiver chains. Range for <b>co-polar</b> signal <b>attenuation</b> meaurement is about 30 dB for both beacons, increasing to 40 dB for B 2 if the receivers are synchronized to B 1. The accuracy is better than 0. 5 dB. Cross-polarization discriminations {{of the order of}} 10 to 30 dB may be determined with an accuracy of 1 to 2 dB. A number of radiometers for complementary measurements of atmospheric attenuation of 13 to 30 GHz has also been constructed. A small multi-frequency system for operation around 22 GHz and 31 GHz is presently under development...|$|R
