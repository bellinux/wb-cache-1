40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis {{was to investigate the}} contract administration process, during contract performance, prior to the point at which a Termination for Default (T for D) decision is made. The objective of this thesis was to determine if there are systemic indicators that may provide early warning signals to <b>contract</b> <b>administrators,</b> during performance of the contract, that the contractor may fail in complying with the contractual obligations, thus being Terminated for Default. This research was limited to Fixed-price Supply-type contracts. The data for this research were obtained through literature research, telephone interviews and survey questionnaires conducted with various Defense Logistics Agency organizations. This thesis concluded by providing a "Performance Indicator Management Model," developed by the researcher, based upon the data obtained from this research. This model focuses on the major areas of contract performance, monitored by <b>contract</b> <b>administrators</b> and provides the most effective indicators, which provide advance warning of contractor difficulty that may lead to default.

While at William & Mary, Stewart became a brother of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity, but later disassociated himself from the fraternity and left after six months. [...] "My college career was waking up late, memorizing someone else's notes, doing bong hits, and going to soccer practice," [...] he would later recall. His soccer coach would later describe him as a [...] "good player" [...] with [...] "high energy". After college, Stewart held numerous jobs: a contingency planner for the New Jersey Department of Human Services, a <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> for the City University of New York, a puppeteer for children with disabilities, a soccer coach at Gloucester High School in Virginia, a caterer, a busboy, a shelf stocker at Woolworth's, a bartender at the Franklin Corner Tavern (a local blue-collar bar), and a bartender at the legendary City Gardens in Trenton, New Jersey. He has said that working at City Gardens was a pivotal moment for him: [...] "finding this place City Gardens was like, 'Oh, maybe I'm not a giant weirdo.

40|$|Practical {{completion}} is a stage when in {{the opinion}} of <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> the works carry out by the contractor has reached practical completion. Generally, <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> will issue the Certificate of Practical Completion when: i) the works have been completed in accordance to the contract, ii) the whole works have passed any specified tests and inspections, iii) the building can be occupied for its intended purposes, and iv) the presence of minor defects does not affect the functionality of the building. However, based on the Auditor’s General Report, there are projects that have been issued with Certificate of Practical Completion, but are still incomplete and not in accordance to the contract. Therefore, the research on the prevailing practice of <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> needs to be refined in order to know to what extend does the <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> has discharged his duties in determining the practical completion. Based on the analysis of data, the prevailing practice of <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> can be divided into two categories. First is the contractual duties, which are any duties that are expressed in the contract and, secondly is noncontractual duties, which are the duties that are not stated in the contract or considered as common practice in the construction works. The data analysis has shown that the contract administrators have performed their duties in determining the practical completion beyond their contractual duties by performing the prevailing practices. They had performed their due diligence and sometimes more than the standards of what they were expected to do. The prevailing practice was needed to satisfy the duty. The more that the administrator follows the prevailing practice of the industry, the more likely that no breach of the duty can be found. It can be concluded that the power of <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> is quite extensive and broad because he is given the discretionary power in deciding practical completion. He has the authority to do more than what is required in the contract. By performing the duties, it will strengthen the decision taken by the <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> indetermining practical completion. This hereby dispels any doubt with the issuance of the Certificate of Practical Completio...|$|E

As a <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> and agent of the Employer, CA provides information to the contractor to enable him to carry out his contractual works,issue variations which may alter the extent,nature and quantity of the works, nominates sub-contractors and suppliers on the Employer’s behalf,supervises and approves the works. In his capacity as <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> and independent certifier, it is the Architect’s duty to issue certifications on all payments due under the contract and certify acceptance of completed works in conformity to contract specifications and accepted standards.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{practical}} problems faced by many contractors in construction contract is the contract administratorâ€™s failure in granting extension of time in a timely manner. When faced with a non-decision, refusal or late decision by the <b>contract</b> <b>administrator,</b> the contractor must pursue his contractual entitlement to additional time vigorously in order to avoid possible imposition of liquidated damages by the employer for late completion. Alternatively, the contractorâ€™s only recourse is to â€œaccelerateâ€? his works and claim for loss and damage suffered in implementing constructive acceleration measures. This research thus seeks to determine the importance of the contract administratorâ€™s duty in granting extension of time prospectively; and to ascertain the prospect of monetary recovery for loss and expense incurred in the event the contractor chooses to accelerate his works in the absence of timely award for extension of time. This research involved extensive literature review on time-related matters in the construction industry, which resulted in familiarity with the issues and achievement of the objectives of the research. The source of materials widely used include reference to relevant case-laws, books, articles, journals, seminar papers and website resources. The research shows that while a retrospective time extension may be valid in most instances, the <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> cannot choose to disregard his duty to administer the construction contract fairly. Thus, where it is possible to decide and reasonable to certify a time extension, the <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> must do so without undue delay. A claim for loss and damage may lie against the <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> or the employer, should the contractor accelerate the progress of his work to make up for a potential time loss for which an extension of time ought to be properly granted...|$|E

40|$|When a {{contractor}} thinks {{that his work}} has reached completion, he will notify the <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> for inspection. Thereafter the contractor administrator issues the Certificate of Practical Completion (CPC), provided that the defects are “minor” and contractor gives undertaking to rectify them. Standard forms of contract generally regard CPC can be issued notwithstanding there are works of very minor nature uncompleted. However there is no explanation on minor defects in the standard forms. As such, {{there is a question}} on the extent on the nature of minor defects that is allowed for the issuance of CPC. <b>Contract</b> <b>administrator</b> normally exercises his discretionary in issuing the certificate and it is always a question of fact and degree whether the defects are minor or otherwise. This issue of whether the defects are minor or major can give rise to disputes between the employer and the <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> on his behalf and the contractor. Therefore the aim of this research is to propose a checklist to determine whether the defects are minor or de minimis prior of the issuance of CPC. The scope of this research is limited to the cases related defects and practical completion in construction contracts. This research is conducted through the analysis of law cases reported in the Malayan Law Journal (MLJ/ MLJU) and English cases that are retrieved from Lexis Malaysia online database and literature. There are eleven cases retrieved and analysed in this research. The methodology used in this research involved four stages commencing from the initial stage until the conclusion and recommendation. The cases analysed based on the facts, the issues and the judgements. Based on the analysis, there are four items in the checklist that a <b>contract</b> <b>administrator</b> should observed when making decision whether or not to issue the CPC. The items are: one, the minor defects must not prevent the use of the project for the intended purpose; two, the contractor must be able to be carried out the rectification within the defects liability period; three, the cost of rectification must be within the outstanding retention fund or the performance bond; and four, the services such as water and electricity has been completed...|$|E

40|$|Claims for {{additional}} preliminaries cost due to project prolongation {{is actually a}} part of loss and/or expense claim. The principle governing this claim was established in Hadley v Baxendale (1854) which provides that the party who suffers direct and reasonably foreseeable costs entitled to damages. This principle has been adopted {{in most of the}} standard forms of contract in Malaysia. As required by the contractual provisions such as in the PWD 203 A (Rev. 2010 / 1), PAM Contract 2006, CIDB Form 2000 and IEM Form 1989, the contractor?s entitlement to loss and/or expense is limited to selected delaying events. In addition, the submission of claim must be made in specific time period as provided in the contract. There are cases when everything else was in order, the contractor was denied a claim due to his own failure to abide by the procedural requirement for submission of claim. The heads of claim under the loss and/or expense generally can be grouped under seven categories i. e. additional expenditure, interest and financing charges, loss of productivity, inflationary cost increase of materials and labour, site overheads or preliminaries, offsite or head office overheads and loss of profit. The objective of this research is to determine the preliminaries items that are considered and recommended for payment by <b>contract</b> <b>administrators</b> in claims {{for additional}} prolongation costs in the Malaysian construction industry. As a general guide, a possible list of claimable preliminaries items established from this study may be useful to contractors in their submission of loss and/or expense claims due to project prolongation in the future.

40|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of motivational research {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century, little has been undertaken within the New Zealand construction industry and internationally little evidence exists on the motivation factors that influence different occupational groups within the industry. As construction remains one of the most people-reliant sectors, employee motivation is a crucial element needed to increase productivity. This research aimed to fill these knowledge gaps by exploring the motivation of employees working on New Zealand’s largest construction project. The research regarded the employees firstly as a single group, and the factors considered as influential motivationally, and also investigated whether specific occupational groups were motivated by differing motivating factors. The four occupational groups included in the research were Project Managers, Construction Supervisors, Quantity Surveyor and <b>Contract</b> <b>Administrators.</b> A questionnaire was administered to 39 employees. 33 responded and partook in structured interviews. The findings revealed that the respondents as a group were motivated by intrinsic rewards such as co-worker relationships and completing challenging tasks which are highly rated on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. It was also found that Project Managers had a marked desire for intrinsic rewards compared to the three other occupational groups. Quantity Surveyors and Construction supervisors provided mixed responses, however they still identified intrinsic rewards as their most significant motivating factors. <b>Contract</b> <b>Administrators</b> were found to have a stronger desire for extrinsic rewards such as monetary rewards and job security. It was concluded that the employees of a large New Zealand construction company were primarily motivated by intrinsic rewards, and employers should perhaps base their employee motivation strategies around these preferred motivators. On a more detailed level, different motivating factors were favoured by each individual occupational group, and this should also be taken into account to improve motivation and overall productivity...|$|R
