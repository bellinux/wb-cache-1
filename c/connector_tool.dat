40|$|English The goal of {{this project}} is to design a {{hardware}} template for the hardware <b>connector</b> <b>tool.</b> With this template, one {{must be able to}} generate C code for the Analog devices ADSP- 21992 EZ-kit Lite evaluation board from a hardware independent 20 -Sim model. The template, together with the mentioned software tools (20 -Sim, hardware connector) will be used during the so called ‘Mechatronica project’, which is a second-year project for students in Electrical Engineering at the University of Twente. There already exists a 20 -Sim C code generation template for the ADSP- 2199 X family. This template has been altered and extended to create the necessary templates for the hardware <b>connector</b> <b>tool.</b> During the project the hardware connector also received some changes to match its goal of hardware independence. We now have a working setup which can be used by the students to easily create a controller in 20 -Sim and run this controller at an ADSP- 21992 EZ-kit Lite evaluation board. The Hardware Connector however misses some features in the way inputs and outputs are defined. There should be implemented some features that make it possible to bind some prerequisites to an input or output. To demonstrate the functional behavior of the board and the software, a demonstration setup has been made to show (some of) the functions the board can perform, generated from a hardware independent 20 -Sim model. The hardware of this demonstration setup consists of oscilloscope, wave generator and of course the ADSP- 21992 EZ-kit Lite itself...|$|E
40|$|Software {{development}} is an iterative process. As user re-quirements emerge software applications must {{be extended to}} support the new requirements. Typically, a programmer will add new code to an existing code base of an application to provide a new functionality. Previous {{research has shown that}} such extensions are easier when application logic is clearly separated from the user interface logic. Assuming that a programmer is already familiar with the existing code base, the task of writing the new code can be considered to be split into two sub-tasks: writing code for the application logic; that is, the actual functionality of the application; and writing code for the user interface that will expose the functionality to the end user. The goal of this research is to reduce the effort required to create a user interface once the application logic has been created, toward supporting scientists with minimal pro-gramming knowledge to be able to create and modify pro-grams. Using a Model View Controller based architecture, various model components which contain the application logic can be built and extended. The process of creating and extending the views (user interfaces) on these model components is simplified through the use of our Malleable Interactive Software Toolkit (MIST), a tool set an infrastructure intended to simplify the design and extension of dynamically reconfigurable interfaces. This paper focuses on one tool in the MIST suite, a connec-tor tool that enables the programmer to evolve the user interface as the application logic evolves by connecting related pieces of code together; either through simple drag-and-drop interactions or through the authoring of Python code. The <b>connector</b> <b>tool</b> exemplifies the types of tools in the MIST suite, which we expect will encourage collabora-tive development of applications by allowing users to inte-grate various components and minimizing the cost of de-veloping new user interfaces for the combined compo-nents...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The recent {{popularity}} of sensor networks and cloud computing has brought new opportunities of sensor-cloud integration that facilitates users to immediately forecast the future status {{of what they}} are observing. The main challenge is how to establish a series of elastic data channels from sensors to mobile users through data-analyzing jobs running in the cloud. The variation of network protocols, the dynamism of cloud-computing resources, and even user mobility result in the following three design problems. Data-analyzing programs must: (1) deal with the major sensor and cloud communication protocols; (2) include hard-coded sensor manipulation and data retrieval operations; and (3) handle job/user migration in dynamic cloud environments, which needs the recovery of broken data connections. To address these problems, we are developing the <b>Connector</b> software <b>tool</b> kit that provides cloud jobs with uniform data channels, allows them to exchange standard input/output as well as graphics with remote users, and re-establishes their data channels upon a job or user migration.

50|$|Solid, {{one piece}} {{compression}} moulded mats {{are made from}} recycled or virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as well as recycled or virgin Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE). Solid mats are lighter in weight than hollow rig mats but due to the simpler connection system provide the same or similar usable working surface area per mat once connected (10’ x 8’, 13.5’ x 6.5’). Typically this means that a significantly greater number of solid mats can be loaded onto a truck resulting {{in a number of}} key benefits including larger working surface area per truckload, reduced number of transport trips per project, reduced fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions per project, and reduced transport costs per project.A simple connection system, using standard <b>connectors</b> and <b>tools,</b> is used which means that mats can easily be installed and connected on undulating as well as flat surfaces, avoiding the need to prepare the ground surface in advance of installation. This also results in project time and cost -savings.Unlike hollow mats, solid mats cannot be punctured and therefore do not take on water (which can increase mat weight) or other fluids (such as fuel or chemicals) that could adversely impact on sensitive sites.|$|R

(2013) {{refers to}} the {{difficulty}} but also the necessity of finding good patterns {{while at the same}} time they identify the need for additional work in organizing and structuring the large body of existing Design Patterns. In the same work it is also mentioned that pattern centric design tools promise to be more appealing to the software engineers than mere component and <b>connector</b> drawing <b>tools.</b> In the literature one can find two types of patterns related to Software Engineering, the Architectural Patterns and Design Patterns. Design Patterns were introduced in (Alexander et al. 1977) as Software Engineering problems that may occur repeatedly, and they are associated with a solution that can be used to solve the problem every time it occurs within the current context that the problem exists. Architectural patterns are similar but with a wider scope. For example, more than one Design Pattern can be applied for specific Architectural patterns. Most of the publications related to Architectural Patterns are focusing in Architectural Styles and Views. Design patterns in terms of Software Architecture Design are generally met in papers related to Architectural Decisions (Capilla et al. 2016; Zimmermann 2012). In a more general perspective of Architecture design (Farenhorst and de Boer 2009) presents Design Patterns as part of the 4 views that consist of the Architecture Knowledge Management (AKM).

40|$|A tool {{has been}} {{developed}} for the special purpose of inserting the terminus of an optical fiber in a cable connector that conforms to NASA Specification SSQ- 21635. What prompted {{the development of the}} tool was the observation that because of some aspects of the designs of fiber-optic termini and of springs, sealing rings, and a grommet inside the shell of such a connector, there is a tendency for the grommet to become damaged and detached from the sealing rings during installation. It is necessary to ensure the integrity of the grommet for proper sealing and proper functioning of the <b>connector.</b> The special-purpose <b>tool</b> provides the needed protection for the grommet. The grommet-protection tool resembles a funnel into which an axial slit has been cut (see figure). Prior to insertion, the grommet-protection tool is rolled so that one side of the slit overlaps the other side. The rolled-up grommet-protection tool is inserted in one of the connector holes that accommodate the fiber-optic termini and is pushed in until the flange (the wider of the two conical portions) of the tool becomes seated on the connector grommet. Then a special-purpose installation tool is inserted in the flange of the grommet-protection tool and pressed in until it becomes seated in the flange. This operation expands the narrower of the two conical portions of the grommet-protection tool. The installation tool is removed and the grommet-protection tool remains expanded due to the flat surfaces on the axial slit. By use of a standard contact-insertion tool, a fiber-optic terminus is inserted, through the grommet-protection <b>tool,</b> into the <b>connector</b> cavity. By use of a pair of forceps or needle-nose pliers, the grommet-protection tool is then pulled out of the cavity. Finally, the grommet-protection tool is removed from around the installed fiber-optic cable by pulling the cable through the axial slit. Unlike in some prior procedures for installing the fiber-optic termini in the connector, the procedure that involves the use of the present grommet-protection tool does not include the use of lubricants that can contaminate the interior of the <b>connector.</b> The grommet-protection <b>tool</b> is made of a fluoropolymer, taking advantage of the flexibility of such polymers and further taking advantage of the inherent slipperiness of fluoropolymers. Although the tool is designed primarily for insertion of a fiber-optic terminus, it might also be useful for extracting a previously installed fiber-optic terminus...|$|R

40|$|Two simple {{interfaces}} {{were designed}} and realized, enabling on-line coupling of microfluidics reactor chips to a nanoflow electrospray ionization (NESI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (MS). The interfaces {{are based on}} two different approaches: a monolithically integrated design, in which ionization is assisted by on-chip gas nebulization, and a modular approach implying the use of commercially available Picospray 2 tips. Using reserpine as a reference compound in a 1 : 1 mixture of acetonitrile and water revealed that both interfaces provide a remarkably stable mass spectrometric signal (standard deviations lower than 8 % and 1 % for the monolithic and modular approaches, respectively). Glass microreactors, containing mixing zones, were fabricated and coupled to the modular interface with perfluoroelastomer Nanoport 2 fluidics <b>connectors,</b> providing a <b>tool</b> to study chemical reactions on-line. Investigation of the mixing dynamics showed that complete on-chip reagents mixing is achieved within a few tens of milliseconds. Metal–ligand interactions of Zn-porphyrin 1 with pyridine (2), 4 -ethylpyridine (3), 4 -phenylpyridine (4), N-methylimidazole (5), and N-butylimidazole (6) in acetonitrile as well as host–guest complexations of b-cyclodextrin (7) with N-(1 -adamantyl) acetamide (8) or 4 -tert- butylacetanilide (9) in water were studied by mass spectrometry using the modular NESI-chip interface. From on-chip dilution-based mass spectrometric titrations of Zn-porphyrin 1 with pyridine (2) or 4 -phenylpyridine (4) in acetonitrile Ka-values of 4. 6 +/- 0. 4 6 103 M 21 and 6. 5 +/- 1. 2 6 103 M 21, respectively, were calculated. The Ka-values are about four times larger than those obtained with UV/vis spectroscopy in solution, probably due to a higher ionization efficiency of complexed compared to uncomplexed Zn-porphyrin. For the complexation of N-(1 -adamantyl) acetamide (8) with b-cyclodextrin (7), a Ka-value of 3. 6 +/- 0. 3 6 104 M 21 was obtained, which is in good agreement with that determined by microcalorimetry...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Two {{particular}} areas {{which appear}} to create psycho-social tension following bariatric surgery are changes to food use and relationship dynamics. Food and eating {{are known to}} play significant roles within interpersonal relationships; however such roles after surgery are largely underreported. This study therefore aimed to explore participants’ experiences of the roles of food and eating {{within the context of}} their interpersonal relationships, following bariatric surgery, along with how people might manage these experiences. Method: A qualitative design was used, comprising semi-structured interviews with a homogenous sample of seven adult participants, recruited from a local bariatric support group. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), in order to generate themes based on participants’ lived experience. Results: There were three overarching master themes that emerged following the analysis of data: ‘Disruption to usual social eating’, ‘Food as a creator of conflict’ and ‘Food as a connector’. Disruption to usual social eating was characterised by a sense of embarrassment due to physical illness after eating. Such disruptions acted as a cue for change, with some embracing this and others resisting it. Either way {{there was a sense that}} participants tried to make the best of their new situation in a way that worked for them. The second and third master themes of conflict and connection existed on a continuum and were dependent upon the impact of and reactions to disruption. Hence, food could assume the role of being a source of conflict or a <b>connector</b> within relationships. <b>Tools</b> which seemed particularly important for managing experiences linked to this continuum were showing pride in the changes, facilitating communication through the use of humour and using food as a gift. Discussion: The findings were consistent with literature around food being closely linked to emotion and a source of maintaining identities/social bonds. Prior to surgery it may be useful for services to offer systemic assessments for prospective patients and significant others, so that the disruption to social eating and modified roles of food can be adequately prepared for. Other group based interventions may also be considered such as programmes with a mindfulness component; these may provide people who typically resolve emotional and social distress by turning to/using food, with alternative coping skills...|$|R
