5|$|A {{year after}} he took office, Bruce began {{investigating}} whether there would be interest in building a religious center and chapel <b>complex</b> <b>at</b> the school. After several years of negotiations with the various religious denominations which had operated on and off campus, Bruce engineered a consensus that the university would build a center based {{on the model of}} the Armed Forces Base Chapel. The new religious center would have a single chapel which would be shared by all of the groups, and office space for each group. The center opened in 1965 and was named for Bruce.|$|E
5|$|After Thiệu's resignation, the South Vietnamese {{military}} situation increasingly declined. On the 26th, the North Vietnamese {{launched an}} all-out attack to take Biên Hòa and the sprawling logistical <b>complex</b> <b>at</b> Long Binh {{from the south}} and southeast. Three days later, the port city of Vũng Tàu was under assault and the pressure against the Cu Chi front was intense.|$|E
5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. Wheeler {{became part of the}} DuPont design staff. He worked closely with its engineers, commuting between Chicago and Wilmington, Delaware, where DuPont had its headquarters. He moved his family to Wilmington in March 1943. DuPont's task was not just to build nuclear reactors, but an entire plutonium production <b>complex</b> <b>at</b> the Hanford Site in Washington. As work progressed, Wheeler relocated his family again in July 1944, this time to Richland, Washington, where he worked in the scientific buildings known as the 300 area.|$|E

5|$|Americium is an {{artificial}} element of recent origin, and thus {{does not have}} a biological requirement. It is harmful to life. It has been proposed to use bacteria for removal of americium and other heavy metals from rivers and streams. Thus, Enterobacteriaceae of the genus Citrobacter precipitate americium ions from aqueous solutions, binding them into a metal-phosphate <b>complex</b> <b>at</b> their cell walls. Several studies have been reported on the biosorption and bioaccumulation of americium by bacteria and fungi.|$|E
5|$|Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an {{investment}} bank on the 101st–105th {{floors of the}} North Tower, lost 658 employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer. Marsh Inc., located immediately below Cantor Fitzgerald on floors 93–100, lost 358 employees, and 175 employees of Aon Corporation were also killed. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that about 17,400 civilians were in the World Trade Center <b>complex</b> <b>at</b> the time of the attacks. Turnstile counts from the Port Authority suggest 14,154 people were typically in the Twin Towers by 8:45a.m. Most people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings.|$|E
5|$|Demand {{for heavy}} water {{increased}} in the early 1950s. The heavy water facility at Wabash, now renamed the Dana Plant by the Atomic Energy Commission, was reopened, and DuPont resumed production of heavy water in May 1952. The site was used a pilot plant for a new production process using hydrogen sulphide. The heavy water facility was closed again in early 1957. The facility, and a larger <b>complex</b> <b>at</b> the Savannah River Site had fulfilled its purpose, supplying heavy water for the plutonium production reactors at Savannah River.|$|E

5|$|Each {{aircraft}} {{requires a}} month-long packaged maintenance plan (PMP) every 300 flight hours. The stealth system, including its radar absorbing metallic skin, account for almost {{one third of}} maintenance. The canopy was redesigned after the original design lasted an average of 331 hours instead of the required 800 hours. F-22 depot maintenance is performed at Ogden Air Logistics <b>Complex</b> <b>at</b> Hill AFB, Utah.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in the}} saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES <b>complex.</b> <b>At</b> the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Fairs and {{exhibitions}} held on {{the lakefront}} sites created demand for an exhibition hall. In 1960, construction was begun on McCormick Place, a huge exposition and convention <b>complex</b> <b>at</b> 23rd Street and Lake Shore Drive named for newspaper magnate Robert R. McCormick. The original building burned in 1967, and was rebuilt and reopened in 1971 {{at the behest of}} mayor Richard J. Daley. Large expansions were added in 1986, 1997 and 2007. The current redevelopment includes greatly expanded hotel accommodation. McCormick Place also houses the Arie Crown Theater, and it is the annual location for the Chicago Auto Show.|$|E

5|$|On 21 October 1977 the 18th Engineer Brigade was {{reactivated}} at Karlsruhe, Germany. For 15 years, the Brigade {{served as}} the principal construction brigade for the United States Army, Europe and 7th Army. During this period, the Brigade performed numerous construction, rehabilitation and renovation missions in military communities and training areas of the 7th Army. These included an extensive range upgrade of the Grafenwohr Major Training Area in the early 1980s {{and the construction of}} the Range 23 <b>complex</b> <b>at</b> the Wildflecken Major Training Area in 1989 and 1990. Additionally, the Brigade was responsible for providing topographic support to the European Theater.|$|E

5|$|Recognized for its {{architectural}} {{and cultural}} significance, the Danebod Historic <b>Complex,</b> <b>at</b> 101 Danebod Court, was {{listed on the}} U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June30, 1975. The complex includes four historic buildings: the Folk School (built in 1888, rebuilt in 1917), Stone Hall (1889), Cross Church or Danebod Lutheran Church (1893), and Gym Hall (1904). Most of these buildings survived the disastrous fire of 1917, except for the Folk School, which burned down and was rebuilt the same year. These buildings also stood through the devastating 1918 tornado, which killed 36 people in the community.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor, {{it was decided that}} the USS Arizona would remain {{at the bottom of the}} harbor as the final resting place for those lost.

It includes a <b>complex</b> <b>at</b> Halawa Landing (opposite Ford Island) and a structure over the Arizona which receives visitors by ferry.
