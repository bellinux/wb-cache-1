5000|$|When {{the fuel}} in a flame combusts, the energy {{released}} by the combustion process is deposited in <b>combustion</b> <b>products,</b> usually molecular fragments called free radicals. The <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> are excited to a very high temperature called the adiabatic flame temperature (that is, the temperature before any heat has been transferred away from the <b>combustion</b> <b>products).</b> This temperature is usually {{much higher than the}} temperature of the air in the flame or which an object inserted into the flame can reach. When the <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> lose this energy by radiative emission, the radiation can thus be more intense than that of a lower temperature blackbody which has merely been inserted into the flame. The exact emission process involved varies with the material, the type of fuels and oxidizers, and the type of flame, though in many cases it is well established that the free radicals undergo radiative recombination. This energetic light emitted directly from the <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> may be observed directly (as with a blue gas flame), depending on the wavelength, or it may then cause fluorescence in the candoluminescent material. Some free radical recombinations emit ultraviolet light, which is only observable through fluorescence.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{considers}} the two approach-based techniques for calculating the non-stationary intra-chamber processes in solid-propellant rocket engine (SPRE). The first approach {{assumes that the}} <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> are a mechanical mix while the other one supposes {{it to be the}} mix, which is in chemical equilibrium. To enhance reliability of solution of the intra ballistic tasks, which assume a chemical equilibrium of <b>combustion</b> <b>products,</b> the computing algorithms to calculate a structure of the <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> are changed. The algorithm for solving a system of the nonlinear equations of chemical equilibrium, when determining the iterative amendments, uses the orthogonal QR method instead of a method of Gauss. Besides, a possibility to apply genetic algorithms in a task about a structure of <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> is considered. It is shown that in the tasks concerning the prediction of non-stationary intra ballistic characteristics in a solid propellant rocket engine, application of models of mechanical mix and chemically equilibrium structure of <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> leads to qualitatively and quantitatively coinciding results.
