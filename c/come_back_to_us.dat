6000|$|... 'Oh yes, you are! You'll leave here. Everybody leaves here. There are no ends of ways {{of leaving}} here. Now, don't <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> That entreaty is the second object of my call. Pray, don't <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> Upon my honour,' said Ferdinand in a very {{friendly}} and confiding way, 'I shall be greatly vexed if you don't take warning by the past and keep away from us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Bhaer, however, nodded wisely and answered, [...] "Don't be troubled, Fritz; the boy will <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> I'm sure of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Colonel Ray, who {{had been}} {{standing}} at the window, <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Όλα τελικά ξαναγυρνάν σε μας (Ola telika xanagirnan se mas, It all {{eventually}} <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us)</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Stapleton had {{abandoned}} the chase and <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> breathing hard and flushed with his exertions.|$|R
6000|$|... "One of our Indians. Other ones {{beat him}} {{and take away}} his pay. He <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> Ready now to take letter, bring rope,--anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And why {{will you}} not do so?' Miss Linnet said; 'you might <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> well and strong, and have {{many years of}} {{usefulness}} before you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My love, my love," [...] said Mr. Fraser, in a scared voice, [...] "it is not God's {{will that}} the dead should <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> thus----" ...|$|E
60|$|Just as he {{said those}} terrifying words, Maria <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> He asked at once what had kept her so long upstairs.|$|R
60|$|Then the cat rose, and {{continued}} his trot; and Montmorency, fitting {{what he calls}} his tail carefully into its groove, <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> and took up an unimportant position in the rear.|$|R
60|$|On {{the next}} day (Sunday), the close carriage, which had been kept at Mr. Ablewhite's, <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> empty. The coachman brought a message for me, and written {{instructions}} for my lady's own maid and for Penelope.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I do. Caroline, {{will you}} <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> to make home doubly sweet to a busy man, {{who will do}} his best to make you happy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> We {{have been}} expecting you," [...] he said. [...] "After all, store clothes and three well-laid {{meals a day}} are apt to pall on one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Hetty eagerly. [...] "That is {{just what}} I mean. If you saw they wanted anarchy, Larry, you would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us?</b> We should be glad to have you!" ...|$|E
60|$|Henrietta {{has spent}} a {{fortnight}} at Chislehurst with the Martins, and was very joyous there, and <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> with that happy triumphant air which I always fancy people 'just from the country' put on towards us hapless Londoners.|$|R
60|$|We {{were sitting}} on the forward deck, looking out at the {{beautiful}} scenes through which we were passing, and occasionally turning <b>back</b> <b>to</b> see that none of the gunners posted themselves where they might make our positions uncomfortable, when Corny <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b>|$|R
60|$|We joined {{our voices}} {{in a call}} with the unreasoning obstinacy with which men will cling to hope, but no answer <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> save a hollow moaning from the depths beneath. Footsore and heart-sick, we retraced our steps and climbed the slimy slope once more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Silly {{children}} cannot choose! No, no, Aura, {{you must}} go out and see the world, and <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> such a belle that your poor old father will scarce know you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An' they do say he's {{a strong}} bearing towards the ould religion," [...] said Mrs. O'Dwyer. [...] "God bless his sweet young face av' he'd <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> That's what I say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> We have been longing for you, my dear," [...] he said. [...] "I don't {{know what we}} should have done had they kept you in Montreal altogether." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was at the}} {{beginning}} of the new year, two days after my master was set free by the savages, that Captain Newport <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> this time in the ship John and Francis, and with him were fifty men who had been sent to join our colony.|$|R
6000|$|At {{about four}} {{o'clock in the}} {{afternoon}} milor <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> after a brief absence. He stayed for a little while playing with M. le Vicomte. Just before leaving he took Madame's hand in his and said very earnestly, and sinking his voice to the merest whisper: ...|$|R
6000|$|The plain {{was covered}} with grass tall as ripe wheat and when my father stopped his team and <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> and said, [...] "Well, children, here we are on The Big Prairie," [...] we looked about us with awe, so endless seemed this spread of wild oats and waving blue-joint.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Campbell," [...] {{the former}} said, coming forward and warmly shaking his hand, [...] "you are changed indeed, {{and you have}} <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> almost the living image of your father when he first joined." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Follow {{them about}} five miles; then, {{if they are}} still marching, you had both better <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> If they halt before that, do you remain and watch them; and send Roger back with the news." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Out with thy news, then," [...] said Erling, as Alric {{stood before}} him, panting violently, [...] "though I dare say {{the best news}} thou hast to give is that thou hast <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> safe and well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see--it is any {{girl with}} him," [...] she said. [...] "He dances with them, pays their bills--see, he pays for Annette there, and away he goes--laughing. You {{see it is}} so with them, too. He has {{finished}} with them now. He <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> Guess I'm not sure I want him." ...|$|R
60|$|However, I must {{set this}} much down as {{counting}} in our favor: when we landed {{in this country}} we had three pigs, and a cock and six hens, all of which we turned loose in the wilderness to shift for themselves, giving shelter <b>to</b> such as <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> when winter was near at hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a {{long time}} before I saw Eilie again. She went abroad to Dresden with her father's sister to learn French and German. It was in the autumn of 1875 when she <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> She was {{seventeen}} then--a beautiful young creature." [...] He paused, as if to gather his forces for description, and went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Chorus, Jack! Chorus, Mrs. Housekeeper! Ho! ho! look at her! She can't {{resist the}} music--she has <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> already. What {{can we do}} for you, ma'am? The flask's not quite drained yet. Come and have a drink." ...|$|E
60|$|DEARTH. Ah! Three {{things they}} say come not back to men nor women--the spoken word, the past {{life and the}} {{neglected}} opportunity. Wonder if we should make any more of them, Alice, if they did <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "John! John!" [...] cried Silas Croft, rising amazed {{from his}} seat upon a sack. [...] "Thank God--you have <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> from the dead!" [...] and {{trembling}} with joy and surprise he would have fallen on his neck.|$|E
60|$|I {{called to}} the gentleman that {{we were about to}} send him a basket, and then, by the aid of an umbrella, I gently pushed it through the snow tunnel to a point where he could reach it. Hearty thanks <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> through the hole, and when the basket and kettle were returned, we {{prepared}} our own evening meal.|$|R
60|$|Captain West strolled {{out of the}} chart-room. He {{said good}} morning in his {{customary}} way, courteously to me and formally to the mate, and strolled on along the poop to the wheel, where he paused to glance into the binnacle. Turning, he went on leisurely to the break of the poop. Again he <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> Fully two minutes must have elapsed ere he spoke.|$|R
60|$|A {{little before}} eleven Mr. Franklin <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> The {{resolute}} {{side of him}} had, to all appearance, given way, in the interval since his departure, under the stress that had been laid on it. He had left us at a gallop; he <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> at a walk. When he went away, he was made of iron. When he returned, he was stuffed with cotton, as limp as limp could be.|$|R
