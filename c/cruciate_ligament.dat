40|$|The {{isolated}} bilateral agenesis of both <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligaments</b> {{is a rare}} congenital disorder. A 17 -year-old male came to {{our attention}} due to an alteration in gait pattern, pain, and tendency {{to walk on the}} forefoot with his knee flexed. The patient did not recall previous injuries. Upon physical examination anterior and posterior chronic instability were observed. Radiographic examination of both knees showed hypoplasia of the tibial eminence, a hypoplastic lateral femoral condyle, and a narrow intercondylar notch.

40|$|Spontaneous {{synovitis}} {{has been}} {{detected in the}} stifle joints of control Wistar rats in 4 -wk and 2 -yr toxicity studies, and a specific site {{was found to be}} predisposed to synovitis. The incidence of synovitis was 27. 5 % for males in the 4 -wk study and 40. 0 % for males and 16. 0 % for females in the 2 -yr study. The severity was not increased with aging. The degenerative changes, including chondroid metaplasia of the <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligaments</b> of the stifle and/or the surrounding connective tissue at the border of the <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligaments</b> of the stifle, were present even in younger animals, and moreover there was a good correlation between synovitis and chondroid metaplasia of the <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligaments</b> of the stifle and the surrounding connective tissue at the border of the <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligaments</b> of the stifle. Vascular changes, including the development of fibrincontaining thrombi, were observed in the surrounding connective tissue at the border of the <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligaments</b> of the stifle.

The injury occurred two days before his official transfer deal to Fiorentina had been finalised, and it seriously threatened his career, at age 18. Although several team doctors feared he would not play again, Fiorentina retained their faith in him, agreeing to commit to the transfer as well as fund the required surgery, one of many reasons for Baggio's attachment to the club.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo provide {{anatomical}} and morphometric {{basis of}} the posterior <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament's</b> tibial insertions in order to assist the creation of anatomical tibial tunnels, in the ligament surgical reconstruction. Material and methodsThe topographic anatomy and morphometry of the posterior <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament's</b> anterolateral and posteromedial bundles’ tibial insertions were analyzed in 24 anatomical knee pieces. The pieces were photographed by a digital camera and the images obtained were studied by the software ImageJ, where the bundles’ insertion areas were measured in square millimeters, {{and the length of}} structures and the distances between significant points were measured in millimeters. ResultsIn 54. 2 % of the knees the insertion’ shape was concave; in most pieces (41. 6 %) the form of insertion was oval. The average posterior <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament's</b> tibial insertion total area was 88. 33 ± 21. 66 mm 2; the average anterolateral bundle's tibial insertion area was 46. 79 ± 14. 10 mm 2 and it was 41. 54 ± 9. 75 mm 2 for the posteromedial bundle. ConclusionsThe anterolateral bundle has a tibial insertion area larger than the posteromedial bundle; the insertion areas of those bundles in our study, were smaller than the ones found in the literature. The variations in the posterior <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament's</b> tibial insertion area suggest that there should be an indication for anatomical reconstructions of this ligament using single or double tibial tunnels according to individual characteristics...|$|R
