5|$|Combined Operations {{examined}} {{a number of}} options while planning {{the destruction of the}} dock. At this stage of the war the British government still tried to avoid <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties.</b> This ruled out a bombing attack by the RAF, which at the time did not possess the accuracy needed to destroy the dock without serious loss of civilian life.|$|E
5|$|Factories, {{ports and}} other {{strategic}} sites {{used by the}} German war effort were frequent targets of Allied bombers from both the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and American United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Many of these were located in towns and cities, and inaccuracy of the bombing resulted in substantial <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties.</b>|$|E
5|$|The use of M85S cluster bombs by the Georgians and RBK 250 cluster bombs by the Russians {{resulted}} in <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties.</b> Georgia {{was reported to}} have used cluster munitions twice to hit civilians fleeing via the main escape road and admitted using cluster bombs against Russian troops and near the Roki Tunnel. Russia denied using cluster bombs.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, Israel {{achieved}} a <b>civilian</b> <b>casualty</b> ratio of 1:30, or one <b>civilian</b> <b>casualty</b> for every thirty combatant casualties, in its airstrikes on militants in the Gaza Strip. Commentators have noted that, [...] "No army in history {{has ever had}} a better ratio of combatants to civilians killed in a comparable setting".|$|R

50|$|Sewall also {{conceived}} {{and led the}} first major field study on <b>civilian</b> <b>casualty</b> mitigation, which she conducted in Afghanistan with an inter-service team of researchers over 2008-2009. The Joint <b>Civilian</b> <b>Casualty</b> Study, as the unclassified version is known, documented the viability of enhancing mission effectiveness while reducing civilian harm and provided recommendations for institutionalizing civilian protection.|$|R
5|$|Arafat's {{ability to}} adapt to new {{tactical}} and political situations was perhaps tested {{by the rise of}} the Hamas and PIJ organizations, Islamist groups espousing rejectionist policies with Israel. These groups often bombed non-military targets, such as malls and movie theaters, to increase the psychological damage and <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties.</b> In the 1990s, these groups seemed to threaten Arafat's capacity to hold together a unified nationalist organization with a goal of statehood.|$|E
5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all {{he needed}} to know was that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the {{prospect}} even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties.</b> The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} authorities at Bombay. The report was released on 11 September 1944 {{and concluded that the}} fire and subsequent explosion on Fort Stikine was an accident. Sabotage was ruled out. The death toll was given as 231 service and port personnel killed, with 476 injured. <b>Civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> were in excess of 500 killed, with 2,408 treated in hospital.|$|E

5|$|During the {{preparation}} for D-Day {{in the spring}} of 1944, the Allies launched the Transport Plan, carrying out intensive bombing of railway junctions and transport networks across northern France and Belgium. Many of these targets were in towns near densely populated civilian areas, such as La Louvière and Kortrijk in Belgium, which were bombed in March 1944. The phase of bombing in the lead up to D-Day alone resulted in 1,500 <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties.</b> Bombing of targets in Belgium steadily increased as the Allies advanced westward across France. Allied bombing during the liberation in September 1944 killed 9,750 Belgians and injured 40,000.|$|E
5|$|In the Greater Toronto Area, local Tamil {{communities}} and organizations began {{to set up}} demonstrations by January 2009, following similar movements in the United Kingdom and India regarding the large <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> from the Sri Lankan Civil War. Tamil Student Associations at the University of Toronto and Ryerson University staged demonstrations on campus to promote awareness of the ethnic conflict to fellow students. During the week of 25 January, several Tamil media outlets announced a strike, requesting all Tamils to not attend work or school during the week and {{take part in the}} protests that would happen in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary.|$|E
5|$|Night falls, and Captain Magenta detects {{an unusual}} signal in the Cloudbase Radar Room. Rhapsody Angel is {{launched}} {{to investigate and}} finds that the readings are emanating from a spinning Mysteron spacecraft, which obliterates her interceptor in mid-air. To prevent <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> on the ground, Cloudbase is moved into Himalayan airspace on its horizontal thrusters, while its personnel prepare for the inevitable final confrontation. When more spacecraft appear on the radar, Captain Scarlet volunteers to challenge the Mysterons in Destiny's place, but crash-lands on the Cloudbase flight deck after his interceptor is damaged.|$|E
5000|$|... 13 Israelis {{were killed}} during the conflict, {{including}} 10 IDF soldiers (4 killed by friendly fire), giving a <b>civilian</b> <b>casualty</b> ratio for Palestinian forces of 24% or 3:10.|$|R
25|$|The given {{numbers of}} Taliban insurgent {{casualties}} in the operation vary, but were estimated between 13 and 15 killed in action. According to the Commander of the QRF, Lt. Col. Kjell Inge Bækken, there were no reports of <b>civilians</b> <b>casualties</b> in the operation.|$|R
5000|$|...Note: In UNAMA/AIHRC methodology, {{whenever}} it remains uncertain whether a victim is a civilian {{after they have}} assessed the facts available to them, UNAMA/AIHRC does not count that victim as a possible <b>civilian</b> <b>casualty.</b> The number of such victims is not provided.|$|R
5|$|Shoup {{argued that}} among the Vietnamese forces {{involved}} {{in the civil war}} there were nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention. He opposed many of the strategies associated with troop escalation, notably the air campaign over North Vietnam, which he saw as an aggressive measure causing <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> that could draw the People's Republic of China or the Soviet Union into the conflict. He also feared that other American interests, including the economy, were suffering through U.S. involvement in the war, and that the U.S. was losing prestige internationally.|$|E
5|$|For the American forces, abuses were {{typically}} either a disproportionate use of firepower or servicemen committing extrajudicial killings (such as in Haditha). Many accusations {{of human rights}} violations against the United States were connected with the First and Second Battles of Fallujah. Following the assault, the United States military admitted it had employed white phosphorus artillery rounds, the use of which is not permitted in civilian areas under the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Several Marines, all {{of them from the}} 3rd Battalion 1st Marines, were later charged (but not convicted) with executing Iraqi prisoners. Some British advisers also complained that the Marines had little regard for <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> and had used munitions containing depleted uranium that caused birth defects for years after the battle.|$|E
5|$|In Oosterbeek, the {{situation}} was becoming more desperate. Hackett {{was wounded in the}} morning and had to give up the eastern command. The RAF attempted some close support around the perimeter which just held, but shelling and sniping increased casualties by the hour. The aid stations were home to some 2,000 men, both British and German as well as Dutch <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties.</b> Because many of them were actually in the front line in homes taken over earlier in the battle, the odd situation was created where casualties were evacuated forward rather than rearwards. Without evacuation, the wounded were often injured again and some posts changed hands between the British and Germans several times as the perimeter was fought over.|$|E
50|$|The book {{opens with}} Major Malich, a captain at the time, leading a Special Forces {{team in a}} town of some unknown Persian {{speaking}} country. They are attacked and return fire, saving a village with only one <b>civilian</b> <b>casualty</b> and earning Captain Malich a promotion to Major.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{controversial}} stories were set during the contemporary Vietnam War, particularly [...] "Landscape" [...] (issue #2), which follows {{the thoughts of}} a Vietnamese peasant rice-farmer devoid of ideology, who nonetheless becomes a <b>civilian</b> <b>casualty.</b> Warren said the story caused key distributors to stop selling the title.|$|R
50|$|Reports of {{casualties}} in the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict have been made available {{by a variety of}} sources. Most media accounts have used figures provided by the government in Gaza or non-governmental organizations. Differing methodologies have resulted in varied reports of both the overall death toll and the <b>civilian</b> <b>casualty</b> ratio.|$|R
5|$|Occupied Belgium {{was also}} {{targeted}} by the Allied bombers from both the British RAF and American USAAF. The policy led to high <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> as bombs missed their intended targets and fell on civilian areas. In a raid on the Erla Motor Works in the Belgian town of Mortsel (near Antwerp) in April 1943, just two bombs dropped by the B-17s of the U.S. 8th Air Force fell on the intended target. The remaining 24 tons of bombs fell on civilian areas of the town, killing 936 and injuring 1,600 more in just eight minutes. The Allied policy was condemned by many leading figures within Belgium, including Cardinal van Roey.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> in Operation Storm is disputed. The State Attorney's Office of the Republic of Croatia claims that 214 civilians were killed156 in 24 {{instances}} {{of war crimes}} and another 47 as victims of murderduring the battle and in its immediate aftermath. The Croatian Helsinki Committee disputes the claim and reports that 677 civilians were killed during the same period. When submitted as evidence, their report {{was rejected by the}} ICTY due to unsourced statements and double entries contained within. Serbian sources quote 1,192 civilians dead or missing. ICTY prosecutors set the number of civilian deaths at 324. Croatian government officials estimate that 42 Croatian civilians were killed during the operation.|$|E
5|$|The raids {{had mixed}} results. While {{significant}} damage was inflicted on Singapore's important naval base and commercial port, some raids on these targets were not successful and other attacks on oil storage facilities on islands near Singapore were ineffective. The minelaying campaign disrupted Japanese shipping in the Singapore area {{and resulted in}} the loss of three vessels and damage to a further ten, but was not decisive. The Allied air attacks were successful in raising the morale of Singapore's civilian population, who believed that the raids marked the impending liberation of the city. The overall number of <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> from the bombings was low, though civilian workers were killed during attacks on military facilities; one attack rendered hundreds of people homeless.|$|E
50|$|According to a 2010 {{assessment}} by John Sloboda of Iraq Body Count, a United Kingdom-based organization, American and Coalition {{forces had}} {{killed at least}} 28,736 combatants as well as 13,807 civilians in the Iraq War, indicating a <b>civilian</b> to combatant <b>casualty</b> ratio inflicted by coalition forces of 1:2. However, overall, figures by the Iraq Body Count from 20 March 2003 to 14 March 2013 indicate that of 174,000 casualties only 39,900 were combatants, resulting in a <b>civilian</b> <b>casualty</b> rate of 77%.|$|R
2500|$|On 10 July another V1 {{flying bomb}} scored {{a direct hit}} on a cottage called [...] "Little Thatch". It killed the owner and injured his wife and child. This was the only <b>civilian</b> <b>casualty</b> of World War II in the village. The cottage was rebuilt and renamed Phoenix Cottage which survives to this day on Effingham Common Road.|$|R
50|$|The {{combined}} {{death toll}} of civilians for {{the battle of}} Manila was about 100,000, most of which was attributed to massacres by Japanese forces. Some historians, citing a higher <b>civilian</b> <b>casualty</b> rate for the entire battle, suggest that 100,000 {{up to more than}} 500,000 {{died as a result of}} the Manila massacre on its own, exclusive of other causes.|$|R
5|$|Though the {{campaign}} was criticized for high <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties,</b> including bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Milošević finally accepted the terms of an international peace plan on 3June 1999, ending the Kosovo War. On 11June, Milošević further accepted UN resolution 1244, under the mandate of which NATO then helped establish the KFOR peacekeeping force. Nearly one million refugees had fled Kosovo, and part of KFOR's mandate was to protect the humanitarian missions, in addition to deterring violence. In August–September 2001, the alliance also mounted Operation Essential Harvest, a mission disarming ethnic Albanian militias in the Republic of Macedonia. , 4,882KFOR soldiers, representing 31countries, continue {{to operate in the}} area.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Great Sand Sea, {{the coastal}} {{portion of the}} Libyan Desert is stony rather than sandy, {{but it is no}} less arid, and {{supports}} little vegetation. Close to the coast, the ground was broken by wadis. Military vehicles could traverse the stony desert with little difficulty, although the heat, dust and wind caused their rapid deterioration. Because it was so thinly populated, bombs and shells could be used with minimal risk of <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties.</b> Winter nights could be bitterly cold, yet the days could still be uncomfortably hot. There was almost no food or water, and little shelter from the cold, the heat or the wind. The desert was, however, relatively free from disease.|$|E
5|$|A July 2006 USA Today/Gallup {{poll found}} that 83% of the 1,005 Americans polled blamed Hezbollah, at least in part, for the 2006 Lebanon War, {{compared}} to 66% who blamed Israel to some degree. Additionally, 76% disapproved of the military action Hezbollah took in Israel, compared to 38% who disapproved of Israel's military action in Lebanon. A poll in August 2006 by ABC News and the Washington Post found that 68% of the 1,002 Americans polled blamed Hezbollah, at least in part, for the <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> in Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War, compared to 31% who blamed Israel to some degree. Another August 2006 poll by CNN showed that 69% of the 1,047 Americans polled believed that Hezbollah is unfriendly towards, or an enemy of, the United States.|$|E
