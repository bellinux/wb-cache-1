50|$|For {{simplifying}} {{the mass}} production process designers {{used in the}} gun's construction cheap types of <b>carbonized</b> <b>steel</b> without or with minimal use of rare and expensive nickel-, manganese- or chromium-added types of steel. Early version had two seats for the crew {{on both sides of}} a barrel, from 1906 they were replaced with an armoured shield. The shield had a specific design: an outer shield, with a big rectangular opening, and a smaller, inner shield behind it. The upper and lower portion of the bigger shield were folding during transport.|$|E
50|$|The class 82 was {{designed}} with a streamlined sloped head with two high beam lamps concentrated {{at the center}} top with two standard headlights at either sides. An ARR coupling system is used, and this is compatible with all of KTMB’s modern rolling stock. Route direction is indicated {{on the front of}} the train within a confined fluorescent lighted box using a lightly transparent plastic. The drivers cab features a dedicated access to outside on top of the door access to the passenger area. The class 82 have two double-leaf pressure plug doors per side each coach. The cab head is designed to be bottom heavy with the bulk of the power transformers located beneath the coach with full use of the top for passenger use, power traction motors are contained within the bogey itself. In terms of safety, the front outer frame is made of heavy <b>carbonized</b> <b>steel,</b> that is capable of sustaining high impact.|$|E
5000|$|The class 83 was {{designed}} with a streamlined sloped {{head with a}} large as per the front windows with two high beam lamps concentrated at the center top part of the cavity with two standard headlights at either bottom sides. An ARR coupling system is used, and this is compatible with all of KTMB’s modern rolling stock. Route direction is indicated on the top-right front of the train within a confined fluorescent lighted box using a lightly transparent plastic which is built integrated with the window shell. The drivers cab features a dedicated access to outside {{on top of the}} door access to the passenger area. The class 83 cab head is designed to be bottom heavy with the bulk of the power transformers located beneath the coach with full use of the top for passenger use, power traction motors are contained within the bogie itself. In terms of safety, the front outer frame is made of heavy <b>carbonized</b> <b>steel,</b> that is capable of sustaining high impact. [...] Unlike the latter class 92, the class 83 like its sister classes are endowed with multi-layered tempered glass that is of a higher degree of impact resistance. [...] The class 83 has a top speed of 140 km/h, at the time of launch this was similar to the top speed of the other classes but significantly faster than the railbuses that were in use at the time. During normal operation, 120 km/h was the typical top speed with the average speed being around 45 km/h. Compared to the other classes, the class 83 was found to have the best acceleration among the 8x classes, and {{this is due to the}} Mitsubishi regenerative braking system being used which gave efficient energy conservation during braking and reasonable acceleration during runs.|$|E
40|$|Duplex {{procedure}} of heat treatment of steels {{is a combination}} of two thermo diffusion procedures with purpose making of resistant layers on wear. There are many combinations of duplex procedures procedures such as carbonizing and boronizing, carbonitriding and boronizing, carbonizing and vanading etc. This paper elaborate results achieved with procedures carbonizing, boronizing and with duplex procedure carbonizing + boronizing on samples from two steels for quenching and tempering – unalloyed C 45 (Č 1530) and alloyed steel 42 CrMo 4 (Č 5432). Key words: heat treatment <b>steels,</b> <b>carbonizing,</b> boronizing, duplex procedures, comparison of results 1...|$|R
