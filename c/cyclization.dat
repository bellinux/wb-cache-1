5|$|Nitrogen analogues of the Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> {{reaction}} (known as imino-Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> reactions) {{have few}} instances; {{there is one}} example of a generalized imino-Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> reported (shown below), and several iso-imino-Nazarov reactions in the literature. Even these tend to suffer from poor stereoselectivity, poor yields, or narrow scope. The difficulty stems from the relative over-stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation, impeding <b>cyclization.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because they overstabilize the pentadienyl cation, β-electron {{donating}} substiuents often severely impede Nazarov <b>cyclization.</b> Building from this, several electrocyclic ring openings of β-alkoxy cyclopentanes {{have been}} reported. These are typically {{referred to as}} retro-Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> reactions.|$|E
5|$|Extensions of the Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> are {{generally}} also subsumed {{under the same}} name. For example, an α-β, γ-δ unsaturated ketone can undergo a similar cationic conrotatory <b>cyclization</b> that is typically referred to as an iso-Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> reaction. Other such extensions have been given similar names, including homo-Nazarov cyclizations and vinylogous Nazarov cyclizations.|$|E
40|$|The <b>cyclizations</b> of {{a number}} of terminally {{unsaturated}} alkenyl zinc iodides to cyclopentylmethylzinc iodides, formerly believed to be nonradical in nature, have been revealed as radical chain <b>cyclizations</b> initiated by adventitious oxygen. Five cases are presented in which the published carbozincation cis/trans selectivities are essentially the same as those found for the <b>cyclizations</b> of the unsaturated alkyl iodide precursors of the alkylzinc iodides by the iodine atom transfer method at approximately the same temperatures. In addition, it has been found that one of the organozinc <b>cyclizations</b> does not occur in a system in which oxygen has been rigorously excluded. The combined findings strongly suggest that these organozinc <b>cyclizations</b> occur by a zinc radical transfer mechanism rather than by a conventional carbometallation that is thought to occur with the analogous organolithium and organomagnesium <b>cyclizations.</b> © 2007 American Chemical Society...|$|R

5|$|The Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> {{reaction}} (often {{referred to}} as simply the Nazarov <b>cyclization)</b> is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of cyclopentenones. The reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants, depending on the reagents and substrates employed. It was originally discovered by Ivan Nikolaevich Nazarov (1906–1957) in 1941 while studying the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones.|$|E
5|$|The silicon-directed Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> {{reaction}} was subsequently {{employed in the}} synthesis of the natural product Silphinene, shown below. The <b>cyclization</b> takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol moiety, so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl alkene anti to the ether.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} described, the Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> {{involves the}} activation of a divinyl ketone using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or protic acid promoter. The key {{step of the}} reaction mechanism involves a cationic 4π-electrocyclic ring closure which forms the cyclopentenone product (See Mechanism below). As the reaction has been developed, variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> provided that they follow a similar mechanistic pathway.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} {{methodology}} for catalytic and potentially enantioselective photoreactions and especially -cyclizations. In the beginning of this work the methodology for photoinduced electron transfer (PET) -initiated <b>cyclizations,</b> catalyzed by organometallic chiral Lewis acids, was developed and the following parameters adjusted: Design of a chiral metal-ligand catalyst and evaluation of the proper PET-reaction conditions (electron donor/acceptor couple, solvent, wavelength of irradiation and light stability of the reaction components). Then the newly developed methodology was probed in different applications aiming at catalytic and asymmetric PET-triggered <b>cyclizations.</b> It was shown {{for the first time that}} PET-initiated <b>cyclizations</b> can be performed catalytically and enantioselectively. A potential mechanism of the <b>cyclizations</b> is also discussed in this work. Possible improvements of the methodology to reach higher enantioselectivity in this type of reactions are proposed...|$|R
5|$|Enolate {{trapping}} {{with various}} electrophiles is decidedly less common. In one study, the Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> is {{paired with a}} Michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to β-nitrostyrene. In this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions: it acts as the Lewis acid in the Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> {{and in the next}} step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R-group.|$|E
5|$|Research {{involving}} {{the reaction was}} relatively quiet in subsequent years, until in the mid-1980s when several syntheses employing the Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> were published. Shown below are key steps in the syntheses of Trichodiene and Nor-Sterepolide, the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual alkyne-allene isomerization that generates the divinyl ketone.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} {{version of}} the Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to circumvent. The first two are not evident from the mechanism alone, but are indicative of the barriers to cyclization; the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and protonation of the intermediate.|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} for the 5 -exo <b>cyclizations</b> {{of secondary}} alkyl radicals onto various imine acceptors (alkyl-, aryl-, benzoylhydrazones, oxime ethers, etc) have been determined. The preparation {{of a series}} of halo C=N containing "bis imine" systems (182 a [...] i) for use in kinetic studies has been described. The rate constants have been established by competitive "internal radical clock" type <b>cyclizations</b> {{on the basis of the}} known rate constants for alkene and N,N-diphenylhydrazone systems. In refluxing benzene the rate constants for these 5 -exo <b>cyclizations</b> fall within the range of 4 x 107 to 16 x 107 s- 1 depending on the electron withdrawing capacity of the imine acceptor. These rate constants are approximately 200 times faster than those for the corresponding 5 -exo <b>cyclizations</b> onto alkenes. The fastest rate constants were observed for the N,N-diphenylhydrazones and N-benzoylhydrazones. N,N-Diphenylhydrazones were further employed in the formation of nitrogen containing bicyclic systems via tandem radical <b>cyclizations.</b> Tandem products were obtained for 5, 5 - and 6, 5 -bicyclic systems. Attempted synthesis of 5, 6 - and 6, 6 -bicyclic systems via tandem <b>cyclizations</b> resulted only in the formation of monocylized products 284 and 285 respectively. A new chiral auxiliary 327 was synthesized for use in the study of asymmetric induction in radical <b>cyclizations</b> in the presence of chiral auxiliaries in systems such as 328 b.

5|$|The first chiral Lewis acid {{promoted}} asymmetric Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> {{was reported}} by Varinder Aggarwal and utilized copper (II) bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to 98% ee. The enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of 50mol% of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> as a tool in organic {{synthesis}} stems from the utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products (including jasmone, the aflatoxins, and a subclass of prostaglandins) and as useful synthetic intermediates for total synthesis. The reaction {{has been used in}} several total syntheses and several reviews have been published.|$|E
5|$|By extension, any pentadienyl cation {{regardless}} of its origin is capable of undergoing a Nazarov <b>cyclization.</b> There have been {{a large number of}} examples published where the requisite cation is arrived at by a variety of rearrangements. One such example involves the silver catalyzed cationic ring opening of allylic dichloro cylopropanes. The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of insoluble silver chloride.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{efforts to}} improve the selectivity of the Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> took advantage of the β-silicon effect in order to direct the regioselectivity of the elimination step. This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott Denmark of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in the mid-1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron trichloride to promote the reaction. With bicyclic products, the cis isomer was selected for to varying degrees.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of the classical Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by Shoppe to be an intramolecular electrocyclization and is outlined below. Activation of the ketone by the acid catalyst generates a pentadienyl cation, which undergoes a thermally allowed 4π conrotatory electrocyclization as dictated by the Woodward-Hoffman rules. This generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β-hydrogen. Subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product.|$|E
5|$|The {{shortcomings}} {{noted above}} limit {{the usefulness of}} the Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> reaction in its canonical form. However, modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an active area of academic research. In particular, the research has focused on a few key areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall stereoselectivity. These have been successful to varying degrees.|$|E

5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov <b>cyclization</b> {{in particular is}} the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule {{must be in the}} s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E
5|$|Once the <b>cyclization</b> has occurred, an oxyallyl cation is formed. As {{discussed}} extensively above, {{the typical}} course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization. However, these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively. Oxyallyl cation trapping {{has been developed}} extensively by Fredrick G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field. The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners. Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity.|$|E

Straightforward models are proposed to interpret both the chirality transfer and diastereoselectivity aspects.

40|$|In {{order to}} advance the {{existing}} methodology of allylsilane-terminated <b>cyclizations,</b> a series of amino-allyl(bis) silanes was prepared for use as intermediates in route to cationic <b>cyclizations</b> terminated by the novel allyl(bis) silane nucleophile.

As a result, this methodology was successfully applied to the stereoselective synthesis of biologically active isotropane alkaloids and the azapolycyclic core of the potent natural insecticide, stemofoline.
