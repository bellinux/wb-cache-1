5|$|Secondary injury events include {{damage to}} the blood–brain barrier, release of factors that cause inflammation, free radical overload, {{excessive}} release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (excitotoxicity), influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons, and dysfunction of mitochondria. Injured axons in the brain's white matter may separate from their cell bodies {{as a result of}} secondary injury, potentially killing those neurons. Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the blood flow to the brain; ischemia (insufficient blood flow); <b>cerebral</b> <b>hypoxia</b> (insufficient oxygen in the brain); cerebral edema (swelling of the brain); and raised intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull). Intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion, such as a hemorrhage. As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure (the pressure of blood flow in the brain) is reduced; ischemia results. When the pressure within the skull rises too high, it can cause brain death or herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed by structures in the skull. A particularly weak part of the skull that is vulnerable to damage causing extradural haematoma is the pterion, deep in which lies the middle meningeal artery, which is easily damaged in fractures of the pterion. Since the pterion is so weak, this type of injury can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma {{to other parts of the}} skull where the impact forces spreads to the pterion.|$|E

Using a structured case report form, we prospectively assessed 1, 933 children at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda with acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Children with uncomplicated malaria significantly differed from those with severe disease for 17 features. Among 855 children with severe disease, the case-fatality rate increased as the number of severity features increased. Logistic regression identified five factors independently associated with death: <b>cerebral</b> malaria, <b>hypoxia,</b> severe thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and lactic acidosis.

40|$|During {{the initial}} stages of hemorrhagic stroke, {{including}} intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, the reflex mechanisms are activated to protect cerebral perfusion, but secondary dysfunction of cerebral flow autoregulation will eventually reduce global cerebral blood flow and the delivery of metabolic substrates, leading to generalized <b>cerebral</b> ischemia, <b>hypoxia,</b> and ultimately, neuronal cell death. Cerebral blood flow is controlled by various regulatory mechanisms, including prevailing arterial pressure, intracranial pressure, arterial blood gases, neural activity, and metabolic demand.

The structural failure of the left wing set off alarms in the cabin, although they {{had no way of knowing}} that the wing had broken apart as the rear of the orbiter could not be seen from the cabin. All evidence indicated that the crew frantically tried to regain control of Columbia as it began to spin out of control, but the loss of the left wing caused the orbiter to yaw to the right, exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing total structural disintegration. The crew cabin separated from the rest of the orbiter and rapidly depressurized, which would have killed or incapacitated the astronauts within seconds. Afterwards, the cabin spun around at high RPM, which caused the seat restraints on their upper bodies to fail. They were thus whipped around violently and pummeled by flying and falling objects from the disintegrating cabin, along with their heads and necks being slammed against the helmets, which were not designed to provide any head protection.

We also measured the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in brain samples and monitored the expression of AVP-positive neurons in the hippocampus by immunohistochemistry. The VD model with repeated cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury evoked impairment of cognitive function and reduced cerebral concentrations of the antioxidation markers. Lesioning the rat PVN showed a similar effect on learning and memory and reduced antioxidation markers in the brain tissue. However, AVP injection into the PVN improved cognitive performance in VD rats, while enhancing/rectifying the changes in antioxidation markers.

Mild hypoxia and hyperoxia produced rapid changes (decrease and increase respectively) in the in vivo O 2 signal. Neuronal activation (tail pinch and stimulated grooming) produced similar increases in both O 2 and rCBF indicating that CPE O 2 currents provide an index of increases in rCBF when such increases exceed O 2 utilization.

40|$|Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are tortuous vessels {{characterized}} by arteriovenous (AV) shunts, which displace capillaries and shunt blood directly from artery to vein. Notch signaling regulates embryonic AV specification by promoting arterial, {{as opposed to}} venous, endothelial cell (EC) fate. To understand the essential role of endothelial Notch signaling in postnatal AV organization, we used inducible Cre-loxP recombination to delete Rbpj, a mediator of canonical Notch signaling, from postnatal ECs in mice. Deletion of endothelial Rbpj from birth resulted in features of AVMs by P 14, including abnormal AV shunting and tortuous vessels in the brain, intestine and heart. We further analyzed brain AVMs, as they pose particular health risks. Consistent with AVM pathology, we found <b>cerebral</b> hemorrhage, <b>hypoxia</b> and necrosis, and neurological deficits. AV shunts originated from capillaries (and possibly venules), with the earliest detectable morphological abnormalities in AV connections by P 8. Prior to AV shunt formation, alterations in ECgene expressionwere detected, including decreased Efnb 2 and increased Pai 1, which encodes a downstream effector of TGFβ signaling. After AV shunts had formed, whole-mount immunostaining showed decreased Efnb 2 and increased Ephb 4 expression within AV shunts, suggesting that ECs were reprogrammed from arterial to venous identity. Deletion of Rbpj from adult ECs led to tortuosities in gastrointestinal, uterine and skin vascular beds, but had mild effects in the brain.

To identify early hypoxia-induced alterations in gene expression during late-gestational hypoxia (6 % O(2), 6 h; gestational day 20) we compared primary mouse placenta and brain transcriptomes using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. Up-regulation of candidate marker genes for hypoxia was confirmed by quantitative RT PCR and immunohistochemistry. Both developing brain and placenta were highly responsive to systemic hypoxia at the level of gene expression involving hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) -dependent genes and immediate early genes (IEG) (Fos, Jun, Egr 1, Bhlhb 2), apoptosis-promoting factors (Bnip 3, Dusp 1, Ier 3) which were all up-regulated, and genes modulating RNA binding and translation (Rbm 3, Thap 2, Lig 4, Rbm 12 b) which mainly were down-regulated. Functional activity of the HIF system was obvious from elevated expression of various known HIF target genes (Adm, Vegf, Hk 2, Pdk 1, Bnip 3, Ier 3, Dusp- 1) indicating immediate availability among early response to acute hypoxia. In addition, genes not yet described as being hypoxia-related were identified that are involved in angiogenesis/cell differentiation (Gna 13, Gab 2), mRNA processing and embryonic development. RT PCR of placenta and brain tissues confirmed up-regulation of selected HIF target genes and IEG.

30|$|Severe {{head injury}} often {{combines}} {{the effects of}} a contusion with an acceleration-deceleration force leading to axonal tearing, cytogenic, vasogenic edema, impaired cerebral autoregulation, and subsequent perfusion mismatch [1]. Secondary patho-physiologic processes may ultimately result in areas of ischemia and cerebral infarct. These changes are commonly found in regions where cerebral microcirculation (RMBF) has been critically reduced [2, 3]. An additional contributor to cerebral ischemia is partial pressure of tissue oxygenation (PtiO 2) with a series of studies focussing on the relevance of cerebral oximetry [4 – 7]. While current evidence-based practice attempts to minimise the use of allogenic blood transfusions, specifically amongst critically ill patients [8, 9] by establishing a restrictive transfusion threshold [10 – 13]; controversy still remains regarding the safety of these measures, specifically when facing sustained low PtiO 2 levels, during the acute phase of head injury [4, 7, 14 – 19]. Studies have showed that a sustained hemoglobin concentration of 7  g/dL (known as the “restrictive transfusion threshold”) correlates with neurological injury due to <b>cerebral</b> tissue <b>hypoxia</b> [16]. In addition, blood transfusion has shown to significantly increase PtiO 2 independently of cerebral perfusion pressure [17, 18]. Furthermore, questions continue to rise despite a recent randomised control study [20] not really challenging the proposed level of acceptable anemia at a hemoglobin of 7  g/dL. In the meantime, the absence of clinical equipoise as well as the lack of methodological feasibility in designing a study that focuses on cerebral RMBF during anemia and severe head injury, leads to the need of experimental models, to further challenge this question. In the absence of clinically available measures of cerebral microcirculation, physiological markers of cerebral ischemia and hypoperfusion rather than global metrics such as mortality outcomes may be more appropriate endpoints [21].|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of how mild hypothermia could reduce CMRO 2 is still unclear. Recent {{studies have shown}} that mild hypothermia and anesthesia can both reduce cerebral oxygen metabolism safely (Ouchi et al. 2006). But maybe they have different mechanisms. One study found that (Michenfelder 2002), constant infusion of anesthetic initially produced the expected progressive decrease in CMRO 2 until a mean decrease to about 58 %. Thereafter, despite continued administration of anesthetic, no further effect on CMRO 2 was observed. Anesthetics, mainly by reducing cerebral electrical activity to decrease CMRO 2, revealed no alteration in normal cerebral metabolic pathways, hence it would provide no <b>cerebral</b> protection during <b>hypoxia.</b> In another study, German scholars observed the effect of mild hypothermia on CMRO 2 and cerebral function through an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), and subsequent decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) to reduce CBF (Bauer et al. 2000). This study found that mild hypothermia improved cerebral oxygen balance by reduction of brain energy demand. The brain electrical activity was less suppressed under hypothermia during severe blood flow reduction, which indicated that hypothermic neuroprotection may involve some other mechanisms. And further studies are needed to make it clear.|$|R
