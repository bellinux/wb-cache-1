40|$|AbstractA fault {{tolerant}} control (FTC) design technique against actuator stuck faults is investigated using integral-type {{sliding mode control}} (ISMC) with application to spacecraft attitude maneuvering control system. The principle of the proposed FTC scheme is to design an integral-type sliding mode attitude controller using on-line parameter adaptive updating law {{to compensate for the}} effects of stuck actuators. This adaptive law also provides both the estimates of the system parameters and external disturbances such that a prior knowledge of the spacecraft inertia or boundedness of disturbances is not required. Moreover, by including the integral feedback term, the designed controller <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>tolerate</b> actuator stuck faults, but also compensate the disturbances with constant components. For the synthesis of controller, the fault time, patterns and values are unknown in advance, as motivated from a practical spacecraft control application.

40|$|Background: Thlaspi caerulescens is {{a natural}} {{selected}} heavy metal hyperaccumulator that <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>tolerate</b> but also accumulate extremely high levels of heavy metals in the shoots. Thus, to identify the transportors involved in metal long-distance transportation {{is very important for}} understanding the mechanism of heavy metal accumulation in this hyperaccumulator. Methodology/Principal Findings: We cloned and characterized a novel gene TcOPT 3 of OPT family from T. caerulescens. TcOPT 3 was pronouncedly expressed in aerial parts, including stem and leaf. Moreover, in situ hybridization analyses showed that TcOPT 3 expressed in the plant vascular systems, especially in the pericycle cells that may be involved in the long-distance transportation. The expression of TcOPT 3 was highly induced by iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) deficiency, especially in the stem and leaf. Sub-cellular localization showed that TcOPT 3 was a plasma membrane-localized protein. Furthermore, heterogonous expression of TcOPT 3 by mutant yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) complementation experiments demonstrated that TcOPT 3 could transport Fe 2 + and Zn 2 +. Moreover, expression of TcOPT 3 in yeast increased metal (Fe, Zn, Cu and Cd) accumulation and resulted in an increased sensitivity to cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu). Conclusions: Our data demonstrated that TcOPT 3 might encode an Fe/Zn/Cd/Cu influx transporter with broad-substrate.
