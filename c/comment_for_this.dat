According to an IPS article of September, 2014, [...] "Last year, OceanaGold purchased Pacific Rim, despite the latter’s primary asset being the El Salvador gold-mining project, which has never been allowed to go forward. Although OceanaGold did not respond to a request for <b>comment</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> story, last year the company noted that it would continue with the arbitration case while also seeking [...] "a negotiated resolution to the … permitting impasse". For its part, the Salvadoran government says it has halted the permitting process not only over environmental and health concerns but also over procedural matters. While these include Pacific Rim’s failure to abide by certain reporting requirements, the company also appears not to have gained important local approvals. Under Salvadoran law, an extractive company needs to gain titles, or local permission, for any lands it wants to develop. Yet Pacific Rim had such access to just 13 percent of the lands covered by its proposal, according to Oxfam America, a humanitarian and advocacy group.".|$|E

The Army began evaluating the permanent closure of Landfill 7 and the inherent problems with its maintenance.

The Army chose to construct a $16 million cap.

30|$|In {{terms of}} the meaning changes {{associated}} with the score, {{findings from this study}} imply that rating changes can be explained by two different rubric effects; assessment criteria and scale severity. For four teacher-raters, the first ratings primarily focused on errors concerning grammar and mechanics. This phenomenon is consistent with previous studies that conclude when raters rate without a rubric, they are highly influenced by grammar or editing mistakes (Read, Francis, & Robson 2005). The reasons as to why teacher-raters in this study focused on these areas could be due to the style and content of the writing. The writing samples were 1 [*]~[*] 3 paragraphs in length, and at times, were underdeveloped. As Eunice <b>commented,</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> type of writing task, she focused more on sentence-level errors rather than on the development of a paragraph or an idea. In other words, the teacher-raters could have paid more attention to errors because they did not have a rubric or because those criteria were a better fit for the given task.|$|R

With offices in Washington, DC and San Francisco, CDT works with all interested stakeholders to develop and advance public policies, corporate practices and technology designs that enhance free expression, privacy, and democratic participation. Through research, dialogue, and advocacy, CDTʼs Health Privacy Project is promoting pragmatic, effective actions to better protect the privacy and security of electronic health information and build consumer trust in a wired health care system, so {{that the benefits of}} health information technology can be realized. CDTʼs work on consumer privacy on the Internet focuses on protecting the privacy of consumerʼs health information on-line, as consumers increasingly use the Internet to access and share health information on-line.

Those expressed here focus on protections for health information as part of electronic medical records kept by traditional participants in the health care system (such as physicians and other care providers, hospitals, and health plans), and personal health records, which are commonly offered by Internet companies and allow consumers to store and share copies of their health information with their health care providers and others as they see fit.
