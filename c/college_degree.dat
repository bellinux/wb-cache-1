In 1965, he was selected for an Air Force program to complete his <b>college</b> <b>degree,</b> and became a commissioned officer.

5|$|In his youth, {{he enjoyed}} polo and boxing. He led a polo team {{known as the}} Zardari Four. His father owned Bambino—a famous cinema in Karachi—and donated movie {{equipment}} to his school.

His official biography says he graduated from Cadet College, Petaro in 1972. He went to St Patrick's High School, Karachi from 1973–74; a school clerk says he failed his final examination there. In March 2008, he claimed he had graduated from the London School of Business Studies with a {{bachelor of education degree}} in the early 1970s.
