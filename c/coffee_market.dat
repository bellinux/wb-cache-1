50|$|As Minister for Agriculture, he {{sponsored}} numerous bills {{directed at}} localization {{of the coffee}} industry. The <b>Coffee</b> <b>Marketing</b> Board, although established by the administrator in 1964, had not developed {{along the same lines}} as the Copra Marketing Board; it was dominated by expatriates and responded to the needs of plantation owners and processors rather than the small indigenous growers. His initial legislation addressed the functioning of the <b>Coffee</b> <b>Marketing</b> Board. First was the <b>Coffee</b> <b>Marketing</b> Board Stabilization Fund, which he brought as a bill on 16 June 1972. Immediately afterwards, he introduced a bill to increase the size of the <b>Coffee</b> <b>Marketing</b> Board to include more growers. In the course of 1973, he repeatedly addressed the problems plaguing the coffee industry, including abuses in buying coffee from the indigenous small growers, as well as the management of coffee cooperatives.|$|R

25|$|The {{external}} difficulties had far-reaching consequences. The {{government was}} forced to suspend part of the country's debt payments and eventually to impose exchange controls. Excess coffee production led to increasing interventions in the <b>coffee</b> <b>market.</b> The state programs to support coffee prices went bankrupt in 1930. To avoid further decreases in coffee prices, the central government bought huge amounts of coffee, which was then destroyed. Central government intervention provided support to the coffee sector and, through its linkages, {{to the rest of}} the economy.|$|E
25|$|Coffee {{also found}} its way to the Isle of Bourbon, now known as Réunion, in the Indian Ocean. The plant {{produced}} smaller beans and was deemed a different variety of arabica known as var.

Circa 1727, the King of Portugal sent Francisco de Melo Palheta to French Guiana to obtain coffee seeds {{to become a part of}} the <b>coffee</b> <b>market.</b> Francisco initially had difficulty obtaining these seeds, but he captivated the French Governor's wife and she sent him enough seeds and shoots to commence the coffee industry of Brazil. In 1893, the coffee from Brazil was introduced into Kenya and Tanzania (Tanganyika), not far from its place of origin in Ethiopia, 600 years prior, ending its transcontinental journey.|$|E
25|$|Producer Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week {{contract}} {{to perform in}} The Streets of Paris on Broadway after seeing her perform in 1939 at Rio’s Cassino da Urca. Although {{she was interested in}} performing in New York, she refused to accept the deal unless Shubert agreed to also hire her band, the Bando da Lua. He refused, saying that there were many capable musicians in New York who could back her. Miranda remained steadfast, feeling that North American musicians {{would not be able to}} authenticate the sounds of Brazil. Shubert compromised, agreeing to hire the six band members but not paying for their transport to New York. President Getúlio Vargas, recognizing the value to Brazil of Miranda's tour, announced that the Brazilian government would pay for the band's transportation on the Moore-McCormack Lines between Rio and New York. Vargas believed that Miranda would foster ties between the northern and southern hemispheres and act as a goodwill ambassador in the United States, increasing Brazil's share of the American <b>coffee</b> <b>market.</b> Miranda took the official sanction of her trip and her duty to represent Brazil to the outside world seriously. She left for New York on the SS Uruguay on May 4, 1939, a few months before World War II.|$|E

The restoration of the Korean way of tea began in the 1970s, around Dasolsa. Commercial production of green tea in South Korea only began in the 1970s,. By 2012 the industry was producing 20% as much tea as Taiwan and 3.5% as much as Japan. Green tea is not as popular as coffee or other types of Korean teas in modern South Korea. The annual consumption per capita of green tea in South Korea in 2016 was , compared to [...] coffee. Recently however, as the <b>coffee</b> <b>market</b> reached saturation point, South Korean tea production doubled during 2010‒2014, as did tea imports during 2009-2015, despite very high tariff rate (513.6% for green tea, compared to 40% for black tea, 8% for processed/roasted coffee, and 2% for raw coffee beans).|$|E

40|$|The great {{challenge}} {{for this research}} work {{is to show that}} the biases of investor behavior are predictable and may affect the <b>coffee</b> futures <b>market</b> prices. This research work uses auto-regressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models to analyze results that cause deviations in the <b>coffee</b> futures <b>market</b> prices. The negative asymmetry coefficient of EGARCH model and the positive asymmetry coefficient of TGARCH model show the presence of the leverage effect where negative shocks have a greater impact in the volatility of returns in coffee than positive shocks.

The present study adopts a survey methodology {{designed to measure}} a combination of socio-economic impact indicators as well as measures particular to the Fair Trade <b>coffee</b> growing and <b>marketing</b> experience. We surveyed over 1200 small-scale coffee producers in Nicaragua, Peru, and Guatemala, of which about two-thirds participate in <b>coffee</b> <b>marketing</b> schemes sponsored by Transfair, USA. The study reports selected results related to production, marketing, material quality of life, education, health, and general wellbeing. Results show that producers participating in Transfair-supported Fair Trade cooperatives are indeed capturing more value than non-participants. This benefit transfer translates into modest but measurable improvements in quality of life, health, education, material comforts, social participation, technical and social assistance, and even sustainable agricultural practices. Consumers can have confidence that the Fair Trade scheme works. Retailers may be assured that by selling Fair Trade coffee they can defend the position that they are participating in a social change campaign...|$|R

40|$|People form cooperatives to do {{something}} better than they could do individually or through a Cooperative form of business. Forming a cooperative will not automatically solve business problems faced by individual households. This is because cooperatives {{are subject to the}} same economic forces, legal restrictions and international relations that other business face. Cooperative members’ expectations about the types and quality of services that should be offered and their criteria for performance of these services {{have a major impact on}} the level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction felt. Members’ satisfaction on the benefits obtained by establishing cooperatives should be evaluated by the level of the deviation of service expectation from perceived service performance. Thus, cooperatives’ performance should be continuously checked against the level of members’ satisfaction. This study therefore, aims at assessing the performance of primary <b>coffee</b> <b>marketing</b> cooperatives and there by to identify factors that impede members’ satisfaction, and to evaluate the performance of <b>coffee</b> <b>marketing</b> cooperatives in the study area, Financial ratios were computed based on annual audit reports of the cooperatives. Here, efficiency ratios, income ratios and creditworthiness ratios were calculated as performance indicators. The result reveals that, almost all the <b>coffee</b> <b>marketing</b> cooperatives in the study areas were performing their business inefficiently. Probit regression model was also employed to identify factors influencing the members’ satisfaction, the adequacy and context of services rendered by the cooperatives, and the major services as function and of socio-economic and institutional explanatory variables. The model analysis revealed that, age, family size, terms of payment for red cherry and dry cherry were found to be statistically significant at significance level of 5 %, 5 % 1 % and 5 % respectively which influenced negatively except the terms of payment for dry cherry which influenced positively.
