40|$|A {{constraint}} satisfaction problem (CSP) {{consists of a}} set of variables; for each variable, a finite set of possible values (its domain); and a set of constraints restricting the values that the variables can simultaneously take. A solution to a CSP is an assignment of a value from its domain to every variable, {{in such a way that}} every constraint is satisfied. Many problems arising in O. R., in particular scheduling, timetabling and other combinatorial problems, can be represented as CSPs. Constraint programming tools now exist which allow CSPs to be expressed easily, and provide standard strategies for finding solutions. This tutorial is intended to give a basic grounding in {{constraint satisfaction}} problems and some of the algorithms used to solve them, including the techniques commonly used in constraint programming tools. In particular, it <b>covers</b> <b>arc</b> and path consistency; simple backtracking and forward checking, as examples of search algorithms; and the use of heuristics to guide the [...] ...|$|R

AIRS shows a small global warming over the 13 year period, while MERRA- 2 shows a small global cooling. This difference results primarily from spurious MERRA- 2 temperature trends at high latitudes and over Central Africa.
