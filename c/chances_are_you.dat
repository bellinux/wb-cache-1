500|$|GamePro {{gave the}} Tetris & Dr. Mario {{compilation}} a rave review. They praised the Mixed Match mode and the SNES enhanced graphics and sounds, and concluded [...] "Sharp controls and absorbing action are what make these two classics even {{better as a}} pair than they were alone." [...] Next Generation, in contrast, said the compilation was only significant for being the first appearance of Tetris on the SNES, summarizing that [...] "Yeah, it's great, but <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> own a copy of {{one or both of}} these games already." [...] They did, however, praise Nintendo for having the [...] "cajones" [...] to package their Tetris-inspired game with Tetris itself.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Wilkening, {{writing for}} Taste of Country, gave the song {{a score of}} 7.5 out of 10, writing that the song is [...] "surprisingly serious and dour" [...] in {{contrast}} to its subject matter, but he praised the [...] "catchy melody". It also received 3.5 stars out of five from John Hill of About.com, who found it [...] "lyrically lacking" [...] but a [...] "solid contribution to the power ballad genre". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine found the song to be repetitive in its lyrical theme, {{and said that the}} group was [...] "sticking to the blandly pleasant, cliché-driven songwriting of Need You Now, not taking a single risk." [...] Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger criticized the song for bearing a close resemblance to [...] "Need You Now" [...] and concluded that [...] "if you swooned for 'Need You Now', <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> won't be able to resist the tidal pull of this one, either." [...] Shahryar Rizvi of Dallas Observer was also less enthusiastic about the song, writing that it [...] "seems kinda old-fashioned amongst all the outspoken and steamy acts in the Top 40." [...] Rizvi concluded by noting that [...] "maybe the music industry's just covering their bases by serving the demographic that appreciates sugar-coated love ballads over brash statements ... If not, well, then [...] "Just A Kiss" [...] will probably appear in sappy, modest teenage romantic comedies. If those types of movies still exist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics reacted {{favorably to}} Dream Theater's attempt at writing more concise songs. In their review, Loudwire commented, [...] "The band {{also seems to}} be {{expanding}} their appeal beyond the faithful with some punchy, stylish and tuneful songs that seduce immediately. Good thing, too. Because the more people that can hear an album like this, the more faithful there will be." [...] RTÉ.ie had a similar reaction, writing, [...] "Sure, the did-they-really-just-play-that? double takes arrive by the half-minute on their latest magnum opus (self-titled for extra definitiveness), but <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> will come away from Dream Theater singing a chorus rather than throwing air guitar/bass/drums/keyboards/violin/conductor's baton shapes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How the dickens can I? We are all {{shooting}} at the Duke's to-morrow, and I believe they're off on Saturday. You're not in earnest by any <b>chance,</b> <b>are</b> <b>you,</b> George?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> that <b>you</b> will <b>be</b> if <b>you</b> do," [...] said Barney, [...] "so wouldn't {{you rather}} take {{one hundred and}} fifty {{thousand}} marks and let me make my escape?" ...|$|R
25|$|Who {{has never}} heard or told a story? <b>Chances</b> <b>are,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a human being, your {{life has been}} {{surrounded}} by intricate webs of storytelling since your birth—and even before.|$|R
6000|$|... "More'n that," [...] said Cap'n Bill grimly. [...] "I'm {{pretty sure}} it'll take all o' you, young lady, an' the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> won't do it then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> may {{part with}} them {{before you leave}} Tavistock. If so, you {{will not have to}} pay for them. You will only have to pocket the difference.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd better be," [...] remarked Kaliko, who now {{ventured to}} enter the room. [...] "You'll have a war on your hands when Ozma hears of this, and the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> will lose your throne and your kingdom." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “No,” said Clay. “Your partner’s {{pretty smart}} and I {{guess you have}} got it safely locked {{up in one of}} the Island ports. The <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> that <b>you</b> won’t <b>be</b> able to give it to me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Seeing {{that in all}} {{probability}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> watching the wives and daughters {{of most of the}} kings of India, the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> that <b>you</b> won't,' I said, for it was dawning on me that Mulvaney had stumbled upon a big Queens' Praying at Benares.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{that would}} be nonsense. And the <b>chances</b> <b>are,</b> <b>you</b> know, {{that you would be}} at Jericho with her. Dear, dear Clary,--you know I love you." [...] Then he put his right arm round her waist, pipe and all, and kissed her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should {{advise you}} to keep your weather eye lifting, Mr. Glover," [...] Captain Crosbie said when Nat paid his {{farewell}} visit to the frigate; [...] "that craft of yours looks very much over-sparred. If you were caught in a squall with your topsails up the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> would turn turtle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There must be oystermen in port, either here, at Georgetown, or Alexander, and the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{would know}} some of them. Go round the water front, and see what can be found. Then try the other towns, and I'll {{guarantee}} you can strike an acquaintance somewhere. After that everything is simple, for you may borrow a rope without fear that information will be lodged against you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Felix {{gave his}} long, light laugh again. [...] "Seriously, I think not. And for this reason, among others: you {{strike me as}} very capable of enjoying, if the <b>chance</b> <b>were</b> given <b>you,</b> {{and yet at the}} same time as {{incapable}} of wrong-doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{remember}} that the slightest movement will cost you your life, for I shall let both barrels go if you do more than wink. I know what your reputation is, and don't intend to take any <b>chances.</b> Where <b>are</b> <b>you,</b> Jim?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, then, Mr. Wyatt. The two constables {{will be here}} at half-past seven, and I {{shall be}} ready to start with them at once. Should <b>you</b> by any <b>chance</b> <b>be</b> late, <b>you</b> will, no doubt, be able to {{overtake}} us before we get there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{less you}} drink, lad, {{while on the}} march the better; but the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> will find by night that every drop is worth its weight in gold. If you have the bad luck to be wounded yourself, the {{contents}} of the canteen may save your life; and if you don't want it yourself, you may be sure that there will be scores of poor fellows to whom a mouthful will be a blessing indeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It depends," [...] the {{stranger}} replied, reflectively. [...] "If {{you buy the}} goods here you'll have to pay such a big price that it won't {{be much of a}} pile. Now, if--I've got the very thing in mind! You'll remember the day you saw me if my plan works. I know a fakir here who has a fine layout that he wants to sell. You can get fifty dollars' worth of stuff for--well, he asks twenty; but I'll say you are friends of mine, an' the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> can make a trade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{view from}} Morambala is extensive, but cheerless past description. Swamp, swamp-reeking, festering, rotting, malaria-pregnant swamp, where {{poisonous}} vapours {{for several months}} in the year are ever bulging up {{and out into the}} air,--lies before you {{as far as the eye}} can reach, and farther. If you enter the river at the worst seasons of the year, the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> will take the worst type of fever. If, on the other hand, you enter it during the best season, when the swamps are fairly dried up, you have everything in your favour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bostil, my one <b>chance</b> <b>was</b> ruined--an' <b>you</b> {{know who}} did it," [...] replied Slone, as he {{gathered}} Nagger's rope and Wildfire's bridle together. [...] "I've no hard feelin's.... But I can't sell you my horse. An' I can't ride for you--because--well, because it would breed trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, {{bring your}} friend here {{whenever}} you please, and when I <b>chance</b> to <b>be</b> where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> working, I will call {{on you for}} one of the shines." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot stay,' said he, sitting down, however. 'She {{must not}} miss me, or all <b>chance</b> would <b>be</b> over. <b>You</b> don't mind the door being open?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{hope it will}} be that way," [...] {{his host}} replied, smiling. [...] "But in {{fighting}} such as we have here, there are constant changes. The party that is pursued one day is the pursuer a week later; and of the two, you know, speed is of much more importance in flight than in pursuit. If you cannot overtake a foe, well, he gets away, and you may have better fortune next time; but if you can't get away from a foe, the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> may never have another opportunity of doing so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you call}} that hunting! Is it worth the while of all those men to expend all that energy for such a result? Upon the whole, Mr. Morton, I should {{say that it is}} one of the most incomprehensible things that I have ever seen in the course of a rather long and varied life. Shooting I can understand, for you have your birds. Fishing I can understand, as you have your fish. Here you get a fox to begin with, and are all broken-hearted. Then you come across another, after riding about all day, and the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> can't catch him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I congratulate you. The <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{will have}} a much better time of it than if you were with your own regiment. I don't mean now, but when the {{campaign}} begins in the spring. O'Connor always seems to be in the thick of it, while our division may remain here, while the fighting is going on somewhere else. Besides, he always manages to dine a good deal better than we do. His fellows, being Portuguese, are able to get supplies, when the peasants are all ready to take their oath that they have {{not so much as a}} loaf of bread or a fowl in their village.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fact that}} we Atlanta are home to the world’s most {{impactful}} advertising portfolio school, the Creative Circus. <b>Chances</b> <b>are,</b> the advertising <b>you</b> know and love? Probably came from Creative Circus… ...|$|R
6000|$|He had {{suddenly}} perceived a possibility. He {{tried to speak}} calmly, but his face was white. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>are</b> <b>chance.</b> <b>You</b> said there <b>was</b> a monoplane--?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Critic Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated it 3.5/5 {{and noted}} that [...] "Tanu Weds Manu is a feel-good, light-hearted {{entertainer}} with the right dose of humor, drama and romance, besides a popular musical score and some smart dialogue that act as toppings. If you like simple, uncomplicated films that tug at your heartstrings, then <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> that <b>you</b> might just like this sweet little rom-com".|$|R
60|$|Before they parted for the evening, George {{communicated to}} his father the great fact of Miss Todd's picnic as settled for the next day; and Sir Lionel {{expressed}} himself as willing to make one of the party if Miss Todd could be induced to extend to him the light of her countenance. On this head young Bertram, though his own acquaintance had certainly been short, thought that he might take on himself to answer. People soon get intimate with each other at such places as Jerusalem. When you have been up the Great Pyramid with a lady, the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> know more about her than you would do from a year's acquaintance fostered by a dozen London parties; and a journey up the Nile with a man may be considered quite equal to three years spent together at the same college,--that is, if the fellow-travellers be young. After a certain age, men never become really intimate, let their relations with each other be ever so close.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose not," [...] said Ralph, chuckling in his triumph. [...] "And {{yet there}} isn't {{so much in}} it. What does it amount to when it's all told? You keep horses for other fellows to ride, you buy wine for other fellows to drink, you build a house for other fellows to live in. You've a deal of {{business}} to do, and if you don't mind it you go very soon to the dogs. You have to work like a slave, and everybody gets a pull at you. The <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> never have any ready money, and become as stingy as an old file. You have to get married because of the family, and the place, {{and all that kind}} of thing. Then you have to give dinners to every old fogy, male and female, within twenty miles of you, and before you know where you are you become an old fogy yourself. That's about what it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{world is}} passing rapidly from {{localised}} to generalised interests, but {{the method of}} election into which our fathers fell is the method of electing one or two representatives from strictly localised constituencies. Its immediate corruption was inevitable. If discussing and calculating the future had been, as it ought to be, a common, systematic occupation, the muddles of to-day might have been foretold a hundred years ago. From such a rough method of election the party system followed {{as a matter of}} course. In theory, of course, there may be any number of candidates for a constituency and a voter votes for the one he likes best; in practice there are only two or three candidates, and the voter votes for the one most likely to beat the candidate he likes least. It cannot be too strongly insisted that in contemporary elections we vote against; we do not vote for. If A, B and C are candidates, and you hate C and all his works and prefer A, but doubt if he will get as many votes as B, who is indifferent to you, the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> will vote for B. If C and B have the support of organised parties, you are still less likely to risk [...] "wasting" [...] your vote upon A. If your real confidence is in G, who is not a candidate for your constituency, and if B pledges himself to support G, while A retains the right of separate action, you may vote for B even if you distrust him personally. Additional candidates would turn any election of this type into a wild scramble. The system lies, in fact, wholly open to the control of political organisations, calls out, indeed, for the control of political organisations, and has in every country produced what is so evidently demanded. The political organisations to-day rule us unchallenged. Save as they speak for us, the people are dumb.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> may <b>be</b> caught yourself," [...] {{the king}} said. [...] "The Earl of Derby and other {{officers}} have been executed. There would <b>be</b> small <b>chance</b> for <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> to fall into their hands." ...|$|R
40|$|If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{to shake}} the hand of Scott Koepke, it would feel coarse and rugged {{after a long day}} of {{cultivating}} the soil. <b>Chances</b> <b>are</b> when <b>you</b> pull away your own hand, it will be covered in garden matter as well. People tend to not think much of that old banana peel in the trash or the slimy worms that resurface after a little rain, but not for Scott Koepke. These <b>are</b> his world, <b>you</b> could even say his soilmates...|$|R
6000|$|... "War!" [...] said Wayne, warmly. [...] "But not for {{anything}} {{inconsistent with the}} beautiful and the civilised arts. War for beauty. War for society. War for peace. A great <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> offered <b>you</b> of repelling that slander which, {{in defiance of the}} lives of so many artists, attributes poltroonery to those who beautify and polish the surface of our lives. Why should not hairdressers be heroes? Why should not--" ...|$|R
