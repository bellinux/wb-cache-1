There is also a willingness to embrace change and an awareness that no change is not an option.|$|E

500|$|Atangana was {{a devout}} Christian, and he {{supported}} the church throughout his life with land and gifts. He opposed popular Beti syncretist practices, {{and he was an}} opponent of an Ewondo initiation rite called the Sso; his efforts led to its eventual eradication from Beti society. In 1901 he secured land for the Pallottine Fathers to build a mission in Jaunde, thus opening East and South Kamerun to Catholic proselytisation. Nevertheless, Atangana supported traditional Ewondo customs on marriage. On widows, he said,My <b>colleagues</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> [...] [...] [...] can only reply in demanding the upholding of custom, which requires the widow to be the property of the heir until her liberation, which can only take effect after the return of her bridewealth.

500|$|On 26 April, {{two days}} before [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] was due to air, the British {{government}} intervened to prevent its broadcast. Howe telephoned Lord Thomson, chair of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), to request he force the postponement of the broadcast {{on the grounds that}} Howe feared the documentary might prejudice the coroner's inquest. Thomson personally viewed [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before making the final decision to permit its broadcast, with two alterations to the commentary. He later wrote that, [...] "paradoxically", the decision [...] "was not a difficult one. My <b>colleagues</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw no reason why the IBA should prevent Thames' journalists interviewing those who claimed to be eyewitnesses and investigating the affair as numerous other journalists had since the shootings, provided that the criminal record of the terrorists and the enormity of the outrage they planned was made clear and the legal position had been established to our satisfaction". With a slightly altered rationale—that the documentary could contaminate witness evidence at the inquest—Howe again attempted to prevent the programme's broadcast on the day it was due to be shown; after taking further legal advice, the IBA upheld its decision to permit the showing of [...] "Death on the Rock".|$|E

In an open space between the houses, just before the entrance to the centre building, we met two eight or nine-year-old girls, skiing. They were smoking cigarettes. My colleague, who is a Russian, said as a joke: “Don’t you know when you smoke a second head will grow on your shoulders?” The answer came right-away: “I don’t care!” This little conversation in Russian was our introduction to a series of meetings with different spokespersons working at arenas with influence on child and adolescent welfare in the region...|$|R

2500|$|After Australia's biggest {{defeat at}} home in 50 years the Australian press were in uproar and the {{selectors}} Ewart Macmillan, Jack Ryder and Don Bradman took drastic action, dropping the captain Brian Booth, batsman Bob Cowper and the bowlers Garth McKenzie, Peter Philpott and David Sincock. Booth {{received a letter from}} Bradman on behalf of the selectors explaining [...] "Never before have I written to a player to express my regret at his omission from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I want you to know how much my <b>colleagues</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good." [...] Booth had made only 84 runs (16.80) in the series and never played for Australia again. Cowper was blamed for slow scoring even though he had made 99 and 60 in the Second and Third Tests. Peter Allan of Queensland was brought back into the side after he had taken the third best bowling figures in Australia – 10/61 in the first innings against Victoria, but was injured and McKenzie was restored to the team. The off-spinner Tom Veivers and young batsmen Ian Chappell were called up and Keith Stackpole made his Test debut, so Australia went to Adelaide with only three specialist bowlers – McKenzie, Hawke and Veivers. England simply kept the same XI from Sydney, even though this meant that Geoff Boycott was their third place bowler after Jeff Jones and Dave Brown. Mike Smith won the toss and decided to bat.|$|E

The model, which we call the ‘mental health matrix’, consists of two dimensions, one temporal and one geographical. The temporal dimension comprises three phases: input (phase A), process (phase B) and outcome (phase C). The geo-graphical dimension has three levels: regional/ national (level 1), local or catchment area (level 2) and individual, meaning a patient or a group of patients (level 3). Nine cells are created by the inter-section of these two dimensions (Table 1). The matrix can be used not only to deal with problems in the description of mental health services, but also t...|$|R

6000|$|... [377] {338}While I {{was in the}} {{sub-committee}} of Drury Lane Theatre, I can {{vouch for}} my <b>colleagues,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope for myself, that we did our best {{to bring back the}} legitimate drama. I tried what I could to get De Montford revived, but in vain, and equally in vain in favour of Sotheby's Ivan, which was thought an acting play; and I endeavoured also to wake Mr. Coleridge to write us a tragedy[A]. Those who are not in the secret will hardly believe that the School for Scandal is the play which has brought the least money, averaging the number of times it has been acted since its production; so Manager Dibdin assured me. Of what has occurred since Maturin's Bertram I am not aware[B]; so that I may be traducing, through ignorance, some excellent new writers; if so, I beg their pardon. I have been absent from England nearly five years, and, till last year, I never read an English newspaper since my departure, and am now only aware of theatrical matters through the medium of the Parisian Gazette of Galignani, and only for the last twelve months. Let me, then, deprecate all offence to tragic or comic writers, to whom I wish well, and of whom I know nothing. The long complaints of the actual state of the drama arise, however, from no fault of the performers. I can conceive nothing better than Kemble, Cooke, and Kean, in their very different manners, or than Elliston in Gentleman's comedy, and in some parts of tragedy. Miss O'Neill[C] I never saw, having made and kept a determination to see nothing which should divide or disturb my recollection of Siddons. Siddons and Kemble were the ideal of tragic action; I never saw anything at all resembling them, even in person; for this reason, we shall never see again Coriolanus or Macbeth. When Kean is blamed for want of dignity, we should remember that it is a grace, not an art, and not to be attained by study. In all, not super-natural parts, he is perfect; even his very defects belong, or seem to belong, to the parts themselves, and appear truer to nature. But of Kemble we may say, with reference to his acting, what the Cardinal de Retz said of the Marquis of Montrose, [...] "that he was the only man he ever saw who reminded him of the heroes of Plutarch."[D] ...|$|E

One of the hypotheses that we returned to regularly was that cultural stereotypes derive from a lack of intimacy; when we open ourselves in the at tempt to experience as others experience, stereotypes lose their objectifying power. Over the course of those workshops, all administrators (from superintendent to building-level assistant principals) demonstrated an incredible willingness to take some significant risks — to share personal insights and values with each other, to open themselves to peer-critique, to grapple with troubling aspects of the images and discourse that emerged at several points...|$|R

The time scale of the model is suitable for storm events to seasonal changes, currently up to one year period. The model is very stable and is capable of handling complicated topographies including inlets and irregularly-shaped structures such as curved jetties and breakwaters. The purpose of three-dimensional models is to predict the change of bottom topography from the spatial distribution of the sediment transport rates, which are evaluated from the nearshore wave and current fields computed point by point in small areas defined by a horizontal grid placed over the region of interest. Models of 3 -D beach topography change require much fewer idealizations than do the line models. (Document has 43 pages.) ...|$|R
