The new runway will be 2,700 metres long and 45 metres wide, running parallel to the existing main runway and located between the current International Terminal (T1) and Abernethy Road. Although Perth Airport plans for the runway to open by 2027, if demand is high enough in the coming years, the airport will set a 2024 opening instead, the same year the terminals are expected to be consolidated.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} July 1999 {{that the results of}} the {{tendering}} process were made public. Metro Edgley Group (consisting of Metro Edgley, Multiplex Facilities Management, and a group of private investors) was awarded the tender. Their proposal intended for most of the rides to stay, but called for the Big Dipper to be replaced with a multipurpose concert venue, and asked to redevelop Crystal Palace as a function centre. Further consultation with North Sydney Council brought the development to a standstill, with the Council and the directors of Metro Edgley clashing over several aspects of the proposed redevelopment. A revised proposal was submitted in early 2000, but this was not approved by the Council until 2002. On top of this, specific applications had to be lodged for each element of the plan, each of which in turn would require <b>community</b> <b>consultation.</b> The development eventually began in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Most rural {{water supply}} schemes in India use a centralised, supply-driven approach, i.e. a {{government}} institution designs a project and has it built with little <b>community</b> <b>consultation</b> and no capacity {{building for the}} community, often requiring no water fees {{to be paid for}} its subsequent operation. Since 2002 the Government of India has rolled out at the national level a program to change the way in which water and sanitation services are supported in rural areas. The program, called Swajaldhara, decentralises service delivery responsibility to rural local governments and user groups. Under the new approach communities are being consulted and trained, and users agree up-front to pay a tariff that is set at a level sufficiently high to cover operation and maintenance costs. It also includes measures to promote sanitation and to improve hygiene behaviour. The national program follows a pilot program launched in 1999.|$|E

Jeepney drivers are required to post kanan (Tagalog for [...] "right") or kaliwa (Tagalog for [...] "left"), in reference to their direction. Since August 2007 a new jeepney route has been in force. The new route prohibits access to the middle campus—which contains most of the university's main buildings—to promote walking and to lessen noise and air pollution inside the campus. As {{this part of the}} campus was the destination of many passengers, jeepney drivers estimated the change would result in a loss of ₱200–300 (US$5–7) and a 90 percent loss of passengers. Due to this, the implementation was met with protests, including a transport strike. A walkout was staged by around 500 students, citing the lack of <b>community</b> <b>consultation</b> before implementation of the plan. The mayor of Los Baños refused to interfere.|$|E
