25|$|It {{is unclear}} {{in what ways}} silica is {{important}} in the nutrition of animals. This field of research is challenging because silica is ubiquitous and in most circumstances dissolves in trace quantities only. All the same it certainly does occur in the living body, leaving us with the problem {{that it is hard to}} create proper silica-free controls for purposes of research. This makes it difficult to be sure when the silica present has had operative beneficial effects, and when its presence is coincidental, or even harmful. The current consensus is that it <b>certainly</b> <b>seems</b> important in the growth, strength, and management of many connective tissues. This is true not only for hard connective tissues such as bone and tooth but possibly in the biochemistry of the subcellular enzyme-containing structures as well.|$|E
500|$|John Michael Wright, who at {{the height}} of his career would interchangeably sign himself [...] "Anglus" [...] or [...] "Scotus", is of {{uncertain}} origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest. [...] A London birth <b>certainly</b> <b>seems</b> supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a [...] "Mighell Wryghtt", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.|$|E

500|$|Another local legend arose about a stone coffin that {{supposedly}} held Richard's remains, which Speed wrote was [...] "now made a drinking trough for horses at a common Inn". A coffin <b>certainly</b> <b>seems</b> to have existed; John Evelyn recorded it {{on a visit}} in 1654, and Celia Fiennes wrote in 1700 {{that she had seen}} [...] "a piece of his tombstone [...] he lay in, which was cut out in exact form for his body to lie in; {{it remains to be seen}} at ye Greyhound [...] in Leicester but is partly broken." [...] William Hutton found in 1758 that the coffin, which had [...] "not withstood the ravages of time", was kept at the White Horse Inn on Gallowtree Gate. Although the coffin's location is no longer known, its description does not match the style of late 15th-century coffins, and it is unlikely to have had any connection with Richard. It is more likely that it was salvaged from one of the religious establishments demolished following the Dissolution.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Travis Fickett {{rated the}} episode 7.5/10, {{explaining that he}} liked the [...] "attention to bits of logic that work as the glue, holding the show together" [...] such as Peter's security clearance, but was skeptical of the episode's fringe science. Fickett also noticed many similarities to The X-Files, writing [...] "not enough {{is being done to}} move the show into its own direction"; he concluded [...] "The production values are exceptional, the acting is top notch, and it <b>certainly</b> <b>seems</b> to be going somewhere. Where, is another matter all together, but {{there does seem to be}} momentum." [...] Website blogger io9 highlighted [...] "The Arrival" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to understand the show. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "The Arrival" [...] the twelfth best episode of the series, explaining the episode [...] "formally, memorably introduced the Observer known as September (Michael Cerveris), a Tabasco-loving, Fedora-wearing, bald-headed time traveling surveyor from the future. His altercation with Peter in the graveyard — mirroring his movements; parroting his speech in real time — was one of the show's earliest water-cooler-weird moments." ...|$|E
500|$|Several collaborations between Rakoto Frah {{and other}} {{international}} artists have been recorded. Rakoto Frah is featured on tracks recorded with Manu Dibango, jazz artists David Lindley and Henry Keiser, Kassav', and Ladysmith Black Mambazo, whom he met while performing in India. As a musician who played by ear, he would join an ongoing performance by listening carefully to determine the key of the song. The American composer and jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman described Rakoto Frah as having [...] "some of the best phrasing of any musician in the world". He was also cited as a key influence by Ian Anderson, the flutist and leader of 1970s British rock group Jethro Tull. In the liner notes for the 1991 compilation A World Out of Time, producers David Lindley and Henry Kaiser expressed their admiration for the artist, stating: [...] "He {{is one of the}} most amazing master musicians and individuals that we have ever met. His mastery of the sodina is on a level that you could only compare to great, western instrumental masters like John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Billy Pigg or Miles Davis. Rakoto Frah <b>certainly</b> <b>seems</b> to know mysterious things about the phrasing of melodies that nobody else knows." [...] Contemporary Malagasy artists performing in diverse genres ranging from heavy metal and hip hop to jazz and the traditional mangaliba have cited the sodina master as an inspiration and legend in the pantheon of Malagasy cultural figures.|$|E

2500|$|According to John Beynon, {{masculinity and}} men are often conflated and {{it is unclear whether}} masculinity, men or both are in crisis. [...] He writes that the [...] "crisis" [...] is not a recent phenomenon, {{illustrating}} several periods of masculine crisis throughout history (some predating the women's movement and post-industrial society), suggesting that due to masculinity's fluid nature [...] "crisis is constitutive of masculinity itself". Film scholar Leon Hunt also writes: [...] "Whenever masculinity's 'crisis' actually started, it <b>certainly</b> <b>seems</b> to have been in place by the 1970s".|$|E
2500|$|Historians {{debate whether}} the {{dramatic}} changes merely reflect long-term trends that were more-or-less inevitable, or whether government intervention played the decisive role {{in changing the}} goals and roles of the chiefs. As Conway (2006) concludes, the new policies [...] "went far beyond earlier efforts to promote economic development in the Highlands and ... represented the first real endeavour to transform the region's social system ... the post-rebellion legislation <b>certainly</b> <b>seems</b> to have accelerated the change." [...] However Devine (1999) and Ray (2001) argue that long-term economic and social changes were already undermining the clan system.|$|E

2500|$|Benevento, as Maleventum, [...] {{was one of}} {{the chief}} cities of Samnium, {{situated}} on the Via Appia at a distance of [...] east from Capua {{on the banks of the}} river Calor (modern Calore). There is some discrepancy as to the people to which it belonged at contact: Pliny expressly assigns it to the Hirpini; but Livy <b>certainly</b> <b>seems</b> to consider it as belonging to the Samnites proper, as distinguished from the Hirpini; and Ptolemy adopts the same view. All ancient writers concur in representing it as a very ancient city; Solinus and Stephanus of Byzantium ascribe its foundation to Diomedes; a legend which appears to have been adopted by the inhabitants, who, in the time of Procopius, pretended to exhibit the tusks of the Calydonian Boar in proof of their descent. Festus, on the contrary (s. v. Ausoniam), related that it was founded by Auson, a son of Ulysses and Circe; a tradition which indicates that it was an ancient Ausonian city, previous to its conquest by the Samnites. But it first appears in history as a Samnite city; and must have already been a place of strength, so that the Romans did not venture to attack it during their first two wars with the Samnites. It appears, however, to have fallen into their hands during the Third Samnite War, though the exact occasion is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|The afore {{mentioned}} {{critics are}} consistent with the point argued by Stephen Booth in Shakespeare's Sonnets/ Edited with Analytic Commentary by Stephen Booth, that the [...] "fools" [...] are not necessarily [...] "witnesses", but rather [...] "exhibits" [...] whose deaths are called to offer a cautionary tale of those whose crimes have caught up to them. In his article [...] "Politics, Heresy, and Martyrdom in Shakespeare's Sonnet 124" [...] John Klause argues against this view, noting that [...] " [...] One does not 'call' exhibits, but witnesses. It is more likely that the fools are being summoned to testify from beyond the grave... If the foolish are to speak, it is to be on behalf of constant love". He believes that the most plausible identity for those who have died as exemplars of constant love are the martyrs, arguing, [...] "But martyrs will have chosen a foolish goodness over a wise compliance that would have saved them from crime. I n the fatal choice they evoke admiration in a poet who feels that their love in some way establishes a precedent for his own". While this explanation <b>certainly</b> <b>seems</b> plausible, Russell Fraser in his work Young Shakespeare claims that, [...] "Martyrs,Protestand or Catholic, were only grist to Shakespeare's mill. To prove Klause's logic would require more conclusive evidence of Shakespeare's sympathy for martyrs.|$|E
2500|$|David Balls of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review: [...] "Unafraid {{to drop a}} line like [...] "My name's Shaniqua and what?", {{it was only a}} matter of time before N-Dubz turned their large underground following into mainstream success. Now, having shifted over 500,000 copies of debut disc Uncle B and reached No.1 alongside Tinchy Stryder, the Camden trio are aiming to become leaders of the Brrap pack with second album Against All Odds. Reflecting their move up pop's pecking order, this trailer single is their biggest, most bombastic moment yet. It's got hawkish sirens and loads of clubby synths - evidently inspired by Fraser T Smith's production on the Tinchy album - but N-Dubz haven't lost their usual quirky charm, dropping in oh-so-relevant references to Facebook and LBDs (that's [...] "little black dress", fellas). With an appeal that extends far beyond the back of the bus, 'I Need You' is – to borrow a word from the inimitable Dappy - probably best described as a [...] "smasher"." [...] Sarah-Louise James of the Daily Star reviewed the single as: [...] "British hip-house at its fizziest." [...] Alt-Uk.net reviewed the track: [...] "I Need You is an absolute fun-packed single from N-Dubz, and whilst listening to this one it really is difficult not to start singing along. N-Dubz once again demonstrates here a great knack for penning a perfect pop song, and this group <b>certainly</b> <b>seems</b> to know what it's doing when it comes to making the music as infectious as possible." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog also positively reviewed the song, mentioning: [...] "It's this kind of bonkers happenstance which I love. I basically do internal bogglejumps whenever they do something like that. Pop songs are so safe, and N-Dubz seem to wander over the lines of acceptable behaviour almost as if they don't realise they are there." [...] The Chemistry Is Dead described the single as being [...] "much more mainstream" [...] as well as something that would [...] "appeal to their old fans and new fans alike." [...] Inside Gossip labelled [...] "I Need You" [...] as a [...] "club banger that has set the standards and told the world that they are here and that they are not one hit wonders." ...|$|E
