If the process is complex and much discretion is accorded to the authority by the empowering statute, the court is unlikely to find that a precedent fact is involved.

40|$|Rare-earth manganites with {{divalent}} doping {{have attracted}} attention {{because of their}} interesting physical phenomena. Manganites, doped with divalent lead, are grown from solvent PbO–PbF_ 2. Single crystals of R_ 1 -x_Pb_xMnO_ 3 and mixed rare-earth (R_y R_ 1 -y) _ 1 -xPb_xMnO_ 3, where R, R =La, Nd and Pr are grown with different values of x using eutectic composition of PbO: PbF_ 2 as solvent. Growth temperature can then be significantly reduced. Optimized charge-to-flux ratio 1 : 6 yields large crystals with dimension up to 4 × 3 × 2 mm^ 3. A variety of surface features such as hillocks, micro and macro step patterns, dendrites as well as clear featureless surfaces are observed on as-grown <b>crystals.</b> <b>Clear</b> surfaces reveal that growth occurred predominantly by two-dimensional layer growth mechanism. The hillocks might have originated {{at the site of}} screw dislocation, which suggests the growth mechanism at low supersaturation.

25|$|Luo-rap is {{the second}} most {{dominant}} kind of hip hop that has also grown in Uganda, especially in northern Uganda. This was recognised after the late legend Lumix Da Don, a.k.a Lumumba Patrick. Lumix was an underground Ugandan rapper, record producer and CEO of Valley Curve Records. He is also the producer with the most singles produced and recorded. Most of Lumix’s singles were either freestyles or were written 5–10 minutes before being recorded.

40|$|Anomers and epimers alpha- and beta-gluco and -galactosides are {{expected}} to behave differently. However, recent results {{on a series of}} Guerbet glycosides have indicated similar liquid <b>crystal</b> <b>clearing</b> temperatures for pure p-glucosides and the corresponding alpha-galactosides. This observation has led to speculation on similarities in the self-assembly interactions between the two systems, attributed to the trans-configuration of the 4 -OH group and the hydrophobic aglycon. Previous simulations on related bilayers systems support this hypothesis, by relating this clearing transition temperature to intralayer (sugar-sugar) hydrogen bonding. In order to confirm the hypothesis, the comparison was expanded to include the cis-configurated pair, that is, alpha-gluco/beta-galactoside. A set of alpha-configurated Guerbet glucosides as well as octyl alpha-galactoside were prepared and their thermotropic phase behavior studied. The data obtained enabled a complete comparison of the isomers of interest. While the results in general are in line with a pairing of the stereo-isomers according to the indicated cis/trans-configuration, differences within the pairs can be explained based on the direction of hydrogen bonds from a simple modeling study.

40|$|The {{organization}} of space manufacturing {{the high quality}} materials, such as super homogeneous <b>crystals,</b> <b>clear</b> medicine etc., {{is the most important}} problem of the XXI century. This is the well-known idea to use micro gravity conditions aboard spacecraft for above-mentioned production. By modern performances the growth of high quality semiconductor crystals needs super low level of the gravity accelerations about (10 – 6 – 10 – 8) g 0 where g 0 is the normal Earth’s gravity acceleration. In all realized space experiments the gravity acceleration level was about (10 – 3 – 10 – 5) g 0. Therefore the disturbance level was too high. We cannot realize super low acceleration level on-board large spacecraft and space stations because of crew action and operation of several subsystems (propulsion system, solar array panels etc.). All these factors generate own vibration. These needed conditions can be realized on-board of the autonomous small satellite with special external power supply system by microwave or laser beams for wireless power transmission (WPT). 1...|$|R
