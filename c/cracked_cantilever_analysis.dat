40|$|Using {{the example}} of a <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam, this paper {{illustrates}} a means of identifying damage in structures using the so-called higher order Frequency Response Function (FRFs) which are based on the Volterra series. It is well known that, when a beam subject to a dynamic excitation vibrates, a transverse "breathing"crack present in the beam can change the state (from open to closed and vice-versa), causing nonlinear dynamic behaviour. A simple model of a <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam vibrating in its first mode is proposed. Across the frequency range which encompasses the first mode of vibration, it is possible to model the response characteristics of a cracked beam using a relatively simple asymmetric bilinear oscillator. As described in this article, it is possible to use these higher order FRFs to characterise the nonlinear behaviour of the cantilever beam and investigate the qualitative relation with the parameters of the fault such as entity and location. In this study, the case of single harmonic excitation has been considered initially. Then, a new characteristic function, again based on the higher order FRFs, is proposed for detecting the crack by exploiting the fact that due to the second-order nonlinear behaviour, two harmonic inputs combine to excite the sum of their frequencies. Comparisons are made between results derived using the simple model described and those obtained from a FE model simulating some experimental tests on the bea...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in the development of structural health monitoring for vibrating structures, especially crack detection methodologies and on-line diagnostic techniques. In the current research, methodologies have been developed for damage detection of a <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam using analytical, fuzzy logic, neural network and fuzzy neuro techniques. The presence of a crack in a structural member introduces a local flexibility that affects its dynamic response. For finding out the deviation in the vibrating signatures of the <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam the local stiffness matrices are taken into account. Theoretical analyses have been carried out to calculate the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam using local stiffness matrices. Strain energy release rate has been used for calculating the local stiffness of the beam. The fuzzy inference system has been designed using the first three relative natural frequencies and mode shapes as input parameters. The output from the fuzzy controller is relative crack location and relative crack depth. Several fuzzy rules have been developed using the vibration signatures of the cantilever beam. A Neural Network technique using multi layered back propagation algorithm has been developed for damage assessment using the first three relative natural frequencies and mode shapes as input parameters and relative crack location and relative crack depth as output parameters. Several training patterns are derived for designing the Neural Network. A hybrid fuzzy-neuro intelligent system has been formulated for fault identification. The fuzzy controller is designed with six input parameters and two output parameters. The input parameters to the fuzzy system are relative deviation of first three natural frequencies and first three mode shapes. The output parameters of the fuzzy system are initial relative crack depth and initial relative crack location. The input parameters to the neural controller are relative deviation of first three natural frequencies and first three mode shapes along with the interim outputs of fuzzy controller. The output parameters of the fuzzy-neuro system are final relative crack depth and final relative crack location. A series of fuzzy rules and training patterns are derived for the fuzzy and neural system respectively to predict the final crack location and final crack depth. To diagnose the crack in the vibrating structure multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (MANFIS) methodology has been applied. The final outputs of the MANFIS are relative crack depth and relative crack location. Several hundred fuzzy rules and neural network training patterns are derived using natural frequencies, mode shapes, crack depths and crack locations. The proposed research work aims to broaden the development in the area of fault detection of dynamically vibrating structures.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, the damage {{identification}} methods of civil and mechanical structures have been drawing much interest from various fields. Wavelet analysis, a relatively new mathematical and signal processing tool, is one of such methods that have been studied recently. It is a time–frequency analysis that provides more detailed information about non-stationary signals which traditional Fourier analysis miss. This rather new method {{has been applied to}} various fields including civil, mechanical and aerospace engineering, especially for damage detection. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide the review of the research that has been conducted on damage detection by wavelet analysis. First, the theory of wavelet analysis is presented including continuous wavelet transform followed by its application. This paper proposes damage detection in beam-like structures with small cracks, whose crack ratio [r = Hc/H] in between 10 % to 20 %, without baseline modal parameters. The approach is based on the difference of the continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) of two sets of mode shape data which correspond to the uncrack cantilever beam with the <b>crack</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam. The mode shape data of a cracked beam are apparently smooth curves, but actually exhibit local peaks or discontinuities in the region of damage because they include additional response due to the cracks. The modal responses of the <b>crack</b> <b>cantilever</b> beams used are computed using the modal testing method. The results demonstrate whether the crack can be detect on the cantilever beam using the CWT, and they provide a better crack indicator than the result of the CWT of the original mode shape data. The effects of crack location and sampling interval are examined. The experimental and the analysis results show that the proposed method has great potential in crack detection of beam-like structures as it does not require the modal parameter of an uncrack beam as a baseline for crack detection.

Changes in the loading patterns, weakening/degeneration of structures with time and influence of environment may cause cracks in the structure, especially in engineering structures which are developed for prolonged life. Hence, early detection of presence of damage can prevent the catastrophic failure of the structures by appropriately monitoring {{the response of the}} system. In recent times, condition monitoring of structural systems have attracted scientists and researchers to develop on line damage diagnostic tool. Primarily, the structural health monitoring technique utilizes the methodology for damage assessment using the monitored vibration parameters. In the current analysis, special attention has been focused on those methods capable of detecting multiple cracks present in system by comparing the information for damaged and undamaged state of the structure. In the current research, methodologies have been developed for damage detection of a <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam with multiple cracks using analytical, Finite Element Analysis (FEA), fuzzy logic, neural network, fuzzy neuro, MANFIS, Genetic Algorithm and hybrid techniques such as GA-fuzzy, GA-neural, GA-neuro- fuzzy. Analytical study has been performed on the cantilever beam with multiple cracks to obtain the vibration characteristics of the beam member by using the expressions of strain energy release rate and stress intensity factor. The presence of cracks in a structural member introduces local flexibility that affects its dynamic response. The local stiffness matrices have been measured using the inverse of local dimensionless compliance matrix for finding out the deviation in the vibrating signatures of the <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam from that of the intact beam.

The structural steel is widely used in various engineering systems such as bridges, railway coaches, ships, automobiles, etc. The glass fiber reinforced epoxy layered composite material has become popular for constructing the various engineering structures due to its valuable characteristics such as higher stiffness and strength to weight ratio, better damage tolerance capacity and wear resistance. Therefore, layered composite and structural steel have been taken into account in the current study. The theoretical analysis has been performed to measure the vibration signatures (Natural Frequencies and Mode Shapes) of multiple cracked composite and structural steel. The presence of the crack in structures generates an additional flexibility. That is evaluated by strain energy release rate given by linear fracture mechanics.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The power plant and aerospace industries have been facing a huge loss, due to structural failure. The structural failure occurs due {{to the presence of}} the crack in it. Hence, it becomes necessary to monitor the structural health under operating condition. Most of the techniques, for structural health monitoring are used for a specific purpose. Some of these techniques require structure dismantling, which is very much expensive and time consuming. So the vibration based structural health monitoring is advantageous, compared to other techniques. Most of the vibration based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) approaches, use linear vibration theory. But, these linear vibration based procedures, have inherently low sensitivity to crack. Since crack introduces nonlinearities in the system, their merits in damage detection need to be investigated for SHM. In this thesis, the problem is focused on studying nonlinear dynamics of cracked structures for Structural Health Monitoring. For this, simulations and experiments are performed. The new procedure for the simulation is developed using Matlab-Simulink. It uses the numerical approximation for dynamic compliance operators and a nonlinear model of cracks contact faces interaction to study the dynamic behaviour of the cracked bar. Furthermore, the finite element model of the <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> bar with crack- tip plasticity is developed and the dynamic behaviour of the elasto-plastic bar is studied. Additionally, numerous experiments are performed to study the dynamics of cantilever bar with the fatigue crack in it. The results from Matlab-Simulink simulation shows the distribution of higher harmonics generated along the bar length, as a function of distance from the crack. In finite element simulation, comparison is made between the resonance frequency of <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> bar with and without crack-tip plasticity. It is found that, there is decrease in resonance frequency of the cracked bar with cracked tip plasticity, when compared with the resonance frequency of cracked bar without crack-tip plasticity. This reduction in resonance frequency is due to the crack-induced plasticity near the crack tip which affects the overall stiffness of bar. In experiments, the response is measured at four different points on the <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> bar at a given resonant frequency of excitation at lower and higher vibration amplitude. For lower vibration amplitude, it is found that the response obtained near the vicinity of the crack shows the presence of higher harmonics of resonant frequency, which disappears in the response obtained far away from the crack. For higher vibration amplitude, it is found that the response obtained near the vicinity of the crack shows the presence of higher harmonics along with the low frequency component. This low frequency component causes modulation, which leads to the generation of side band frequencies near the resonant frequency. The occurrence of low frequency component and side band frequencies is due to the vibro-impact behaviour of crack. The amplitude of these side band frequencies and higher harmonics are reduced in the response obtained far away from the crack. This indicates that crack-induced nonlinearity has a localized effect on the dynamics of bar. It is also observed that the magnitude of low frequency component is proportional to the magnitude of resonant frequency of excitation. This indicates that crack behaves like a signal modulator, detector of low frequency component and amplifier as the magnitude of low frequency component is proportional to the magnitude of resonant frequency excitation. From the Matlab-Simulink simulation and experimental results, it is concluded that crackinduced nonlinearity affects the dynamic behaviour of the cracked bar significantly, which will be effective in structural health monitoring.

This indicates that crack behaves like a signal modulator, detector of low frequency component and amplifier as the magnitude of low frequency component is proportional to the magnitude of resonant frequency excitation. From the Matlab-Simulink simulation and experimental results, it is concluded that crackinduced nonlinearity affects the dynamic behaviour of the cracked bar significantly, which will be effective in structural health monitoring.

40|$|Engineering {{structures}} have {{structural defects}} such as cracks due to long term services, vibrations and material non-uniformity. Cracks in structural members lead to local {{changes in their}} stiffness and consequently their static and dynamic behavior is altered. Cracked beam problem has grabbed the attention of many researchers in recent years. Analytical, numerical and semi-numerical methods have been developed during the years. The influence of cracks on free vibration and buckling load of the beam with a single transverse thorough surface crack using finite element method (FEM) is investigated in present work. In this study modal <b>analysis</b> of a <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam with circular cross section is analyzed for different crack positions and different crack depths using Ansys, Matlab and FFT Analyzer. Buckling analysis of the beam is also carried out using finite element method (FEM). Beam element of {{two degrees of freedom}} (transverse displacement and rotation) is taken for analysis. Stiffness matrix of intact beam element as well as the cracked beam element is computed from total flexibility matrix. Modal frequencies are verified using analytical and experimental procedures for different crack locations and different crack depths. Buckling load of the column is computed from the modal analysis...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the dynamic {{behavior}} of a fatigue cracked beam is investigated. The purpose is to reveal the nonlinear behavior of the structure with fatigue damage by using wavelet transform. A <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam is modeled by the finite element (FE) method using ALGOR ™ software. A breathing crack is described in the FE method as a surface to surface contact of the two edges of the crack during vibration. Strain time history in the area adjacent to the crack has been analyzed using data processing techniques. Nonlinear effects in signals are usually difficult to detect by conventional data processing methods such as fast Fourier transform. However wavelet transform has recently {{been shown to be}} an effective method of detecting such nonlinear effects in signals. Modulus maxima, an important property of wavelet transform, have been used as an indicator of the crack size. Numerical results obtained from the FE analysis are presented in this paper, as well as some experimental results. It is shown that detection of fatigue cracks using breathing behavior and wavelet transform can be used to develop a vibration-based crack detection technique. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of a crack could not only cause a local variation in the stiffness, but it could affect the mechanical behaviour of the entire structure to a considerable extent. The frequencies of natural vibrations, amplitudes of forced vibrations and areas of dynamic stability change due {{to the existence of}} such cracks. The vibration characteristics of cracked structures can be useful for non-destructive testing. In particular, the natural frequencies and mode shapes of cracked beams can provide insight into the extent of damage. The beam has been schematized as a 2 -D continuous medium and discretized by means of quadrilateral finite elements. The lowest three natural frequencies (and the associated mode shapes) of the <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam, were obtained via both modal and spectral analyses, and were compared with experimental data from literature in order to assess the reliability of different models of crack state, namely open crack and contact crack. Both experimental and numerical results reveal the significant influence of the opening and closing conditions of the crack on the frequency reduction; namely this reduction decreases as more realistic contact phenomena are considered at crack interfaces...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{analyzes}} {{the free and}} forced dynamics of a 2 -DOF mechanical system with piecewise linear restoring force, by means of analytical/numerical and experimental investigations. This oscillator is roughly representative of an asymmetrically <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam vibrating in bending and hence exhibiting a bilinear stiffness, {{depending on whether the}} crack is open or closed. A parametric analysis of the NNMs has been performed {{for a wide range of}} the damage parameter: the influence of damage on the nonlinear frequencies has been investigated and bifurcations characterized by the onset of superabundant modes with or without internal resonance, have been revealed. The dynamic behavior of the system under harmonic base excitation has been numerically investigated assuming both low and high damping. It has been found that the NNMs of the free motion play a key role in the system forced response. Finally, a test set-up has then been built to investigate the validity of the proposed model for technical applications: the experimental measurements qualitatively and quantitatively capture the basic bifurcation scenarios anticipated by the model while a strong robustness of the phenomena pointed out by the theoretical analyses has been revealed in the experiments...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{the effects}} of the non-propagating open cracks on the dynamic {{behaviors}} of a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid are studied. The model divides the pipe into a number of segments from the crack sections and assembles all segments each by each by a rotational spring which has no mass. The stiffness of the spring is obtained through linear fracture mechanics. In order to obtain the modal functions which satisfy the boundary conditions and geometrical discontinuity conditions at the crack’s location, a simple approach is used. That is adding polynomial functions to the modal functions of the uncracked beam. The equations of motion for the <b>cracked</b> <b>cantilevered</b> pipe conveying fluid is derived based on the extended Lagrange equations for systems containing non-material volumes. Not only the virtual work done by the discharged fluid, but also that done by the fluid at the crack position due to the geometrical discontinuity conditions are considered in the present equations of motion. In this article, several numerical examples are given. The comparisons of solutions of the present equations with that of model in existence show that the present work is better. The influences of the relative depth, the position ratio of the cracks, the flow velocity on the eigenvalues are depicted...|$|R
