25|$|A 2010 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} Chinese-language literature found numerous acupuncture-related adverse events, including pneumothorax, fainting, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and infection as the most frequent, and cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious, {{most of which were}} due to improper technique. Between 1980 and 2009, the Chinese-language literature reported 479 adverse events. Prospective surveys show that mild, transient acupuncture-associated adverse events ranged from 6.71% to 15%. In a study with 190,924 patients, the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly 0.024%. Another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of 2.2%, 4,963 incidences among 229,230 patients. Infections, mainly hepatitis, after acupuncture are reported often in English-language research, though are rarely reported in Chinese-language research, making it plausible that acupuncture-associated infections have been underreported in China. Infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles. Other adverse events included spinal epidural hematoma (in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine), <b>chylothorax,</b> injuries of abdominal organs and tissues, injuries in the neck region, injuries to the eyes, including orbital hemorrhage, traumatic cataract, injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture, hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis, peripheral motor-nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction, local allergic reactions to metal needles, stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture.|$|E

50|$|A chyle fistula {{occurs when}} defect(s) of lymphatic vessel(s) result in leakage of lymphatic fluid, {{typically}} accumulating in the thoracic (pleural) or abdominal (peritoneal) cavities, {{leading to a}} chylous pleural effusion (<b>chylothorax)</b> or chylous ascites, respectively.|$|E
50|$|A <b>chylothorax</b> (or chyle leak) {{is a type}} of pleural effusion. It {{results from}} lymph formed in the {{digestive}} system called chyle accumulating in the pleural cavity due to either disruption or obstruction of the thoracic duct.|$|E

5000|$|Pleural effusion: a fluid {{accumulation}} {{within the}} pleural space. Abnormal collections of pleural fluid {{may be due}} to excessive fluid volume (i.e. excess intravenous fluids, renal failure), decreased fluid protein (e.g. cirrhosis, proteinuria), heart failure, bleeding (hemothorax), infections (parapneumonic effusions, pleural empyema), inflammation, malignancies, or perforation of thoracic organs (i.e. <b>chylothorax,</b> esophageal rupture).|$|E
50|$|In {{people on}} a normal diet, this {{effusion}} can be identified by its turbid, milky white appearance, since chyle contains high levels of triglycerides. It is important to distinguish <b>chylothorax</b> from pseudochylothorax (pleural effusions high in cholesterol), which has a similar appearance, but is caused by more chronic inflammatory processes, and has a different treatment.|$|E
50|$|Other {{causes of}} pleural {{effusion}} include tuberculosis (though stains of pleural fluid are only rarely positive for acid-fast bacilli, {{this is the}} most common cause of pleural effusions in some developing countries), autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, bleeding (often due to chest trauma), <b>chylothorax</b> (most commonly caused by trauma), and accidental infusion of fluids.|$|E
50|$|In most centers, the {{mortality}} risk for surgery is between zero and 2%. A specific risk of open surgical repair of double aortic arch is {{injury to the}} recurrent laryngeal nerve, which can cause vocal cord paralysis. Injury to the lymphatic system can lead to postoperative <b>chylothorax.</b> Additional risks include lung injury, bleeding {{with the need for}} blood transfusions and wound infection.|$|E
50|$|Pleural effusions {{may also}} develop {{following}} {{the accumulation of}} other fluids within the pleural cavity; if the fluid is blood it is known as hemothorax (as in major chest injuries), if the fluid is pus it is known as pyothorax (resulting from chest infections), and if the fluid is lymph it is known as <b>chylothorax</b> (resulting from rupture of the thoracic duct).|$|E
50|$|Pulmonary {{function}} testing {{can show}} obstruction of the airways. People with pleural effusions may show evidence of restriction in lung volumes {{due to the}} fluid. Analysis of the fluid in pleural effusions generally shows high levels of protein but low levels of cholesterol and lactate dehydrogenase, but about 30% of effusions are chylous (<b>chylothorax)</b> in {{that they have the}} characteristics of lymph.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{mechanism}} behind <b>chylothorax</b> {{is not well}} understood, treatment options are limited. Drainage of the fluid out of the pleural space is essential to obviate damage to organs, especially the inhibition of lung function by the counter pressure of the chyle. Another treatment option is pleuroperitoneal shunting (creating a communication channel between pleural space and peritoneal cavity). By this surgical technique loss of essential triglycerides that escape the thoracic duct can be prevented. Omitting fat (in particular FFA) from the diet is essential. Either surgical or chemical pleurodesis are options: the leaking of lymphatic fluids is stopped by irritating the lungs and chest wall, resulting in a sterile inflammation. This causes the lung and the chest wall to be fused together which prevents the leaking of lymphatic fluids into the pleural space. The medication octreotide {{has been shown to}} be beneficial and in some cases will stop the <b>chylothorax</b> after a few weeks.|$|E
50|$|In human anatomy, the {{thoracic}} duct {{is the largest}} of the two lymph ducts of the lymphatic system. It is also known as the left lymphatic duct, alimentary duct, chyliferous duct, and Van Hoorne's canal. The other duct is the right lymphatic duct. It carries chyle, a liquid containing both lymph and emulsified fats, rather than pure lymph. Thus when it ruptures, the resulting flood of liquid into the pleural cavity is known as <b>chylothorax.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{the bone}} {{destruction}} spontaneously ceases and no treatment is required. But when {{the disease is}} progressive, aggressive intervention may be necessary. Duffy and colleagues reported that around 17% of patients with Gorham's disease in the ribs, shoulder, or upper spine experience extension of the disease into the chest, leading to <b>chylothorax</b> with its serious consequences, and that the mortality rate in this group can reach as high as 64% without surgical intervention.|$|E
50|$|The {{first sign}} of a malignancy, {{especially}} an intraabdominal one, may be an enlarged Virchow's node, a lymph node in the left supraclavicular area, in the vicinity where the thoracic duct empties into the left brachiocephalic vein, right between where the left subclavian vein and left internal jugular join (i.e. the left Pirogoff angle). When the thoracic duct is blocked or damaged {{a large amount of}} lymph can quickly accumulate in the pleural cavity, this situation is called <b>chylothorax.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A pleural {{effusion}} is excess fluid that accumulates in the pleural cavity, the fluid-filled space {{that surrounds the}} lungs. This excess can impair breathing by limiting {{the expansion of the}} lungs. Various kinds of {{pleural effusion}}, depending {{on the nature of the}} fluid and what caused its entry into the pleural space, are hydrothorax (serous fluid), hemothorax (blood), urinothorax (urine), <b>chylothorax</b> (chyle), or pyothorax (pus). A pneumothorax is the accumulation of air in the pleural space, and is commonly called a [...] "collapsed lung." ...|$|E

Scoliosis was associated with extranumerary vertebral bodies and 13 ribs. Because of delayed gastric emptying, a gastrostomy tube was inserted. In addition, because of persistent <b>chylothorax,</b> he underwent decortication of the right lung and oversewing of the thoracic duct.|$|E

50|$|LAM {{can come}} to medical {{attention}} in several ways, most of which trigger a chest CT. Thin-walled cystic change in the lungs may be found incidentally on CT scans of the heart, chest or abdomen (on the cuts that include lung bases) obtained for other purposes. HRCTs of TSC patients reveals that about 20% of women have cystic change by age 20 and about 80% of women have cystic changes after age 40. LAM is sometimes revealed by chest CT in patients who present with an apparent primary spontaneous pneumothorax, but more often CT scanning is not ordered (in the United States) until recurrences occur. Progressive dyspnea on exertion without the exacerbations and remissions that are characteristic of asthma or COPD sometimes prompt a chest CT. A review of the CT by an expert familiar with LAM may increase diagnostic accuracy. <b>Chylothorax</b> can also bring LAM to attention.|$|E
5000|$|... • CARDIOTHORACIC - Symptoms {{that arise}} from disease of the cardiothoracic region include a chronic cough, wheezing, dyspnea (shortness of breath)—especially serious when {{occurring}} at rest or when lying down—fever, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, anxiety, and coughing up blood or chyle. As the deranged lymphatic vessels invade the organs and tissues in the chest they put stress on the heart and lungs, interfering with their ability to function normally. Additionally, these lymphatic vessels may leak, allowing fluid to accumulate in the chest, which puts further pressure on the vital organs, thus increasing their inability to function properly. [...] Accumulations of fluid and chyle are named based on their contents and location: pulmonary edema (the presence of fluid and/or chyle in the lung), pleural effusions (fluid in the lung lining), pericardial effusions (fluid in the heart sack), <b>chylothorax</b> (chyle in the pleural cavity); and chylopericardium (chyle in the heart sack).|$|E
50|$|Chyle {{does not}} {{generally}} cause pleural inflammation or fibrosis. Small stable chylous effusions rarely require intervention once the LAM diagnosis is made. Shortness of breath may mandate possibly repeated drainage. Sirolimus is effective for chylous effusions and most experts believe {{it should be}} used as the first line of therapy. Imaging the source of the leak with heavy T2-weighted MRI or contrast lymphangiography is an advised for refractory effusions. Some leaks are amenable to embolization through catheters threaded from groin lymph nodes into the thoracic duct. Thoracic duct ligation can be considered, but since thoracic effusions sometimes originate from ascites that are siphoned into the chest by the bellows action of the thorax, it is important to rule out an abdominal source before considering this option. Pleural symphysis may be required to prevent nutritional and lymphocyte deficiencies that can result from repeated taps or persistent drainage. Chemical pleurodesis is generally an effective therapy for <b>chylothorax,</b> as is mechanical abrasion and talc poudrage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Chylothorax</b> {{refers to}} the {{accumulation}} of chyle in the pleural cavity. Although rare, {{it is the most}} frequent cause of pleural effusion in the neonatal period. Its incidence is estimated at one in 15, 000 neonates. The causes of <b>chylothorax</b> are multiple, and there are several major types of <b>chylothorax</b> defined by origin, ie, traumatic (and iatrogenic) <b>chylothorax,</b> medical (spontane-ous) <b>chylothorax,</b> and congenital <b>chylothorax.</b> A case of neonatal <b>chylothorax</b> following surgery for esophageal atresia and our therapeutic approach to this entity are presented. Conservative therapy with total enteral nutrition and drainage were sufficient. Treatment for <b>chylothorax</b> is essentially medical, ie, pleural drainage, removal of dietary fats, treatment of any medical cause, and use of drugs to reduce production of chyle. In the event of failure or reappearance of a large effusion, surgical treatment is needed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: <b>Chylothorax</b> in {{paediatric}} age is {{a life-threatening}} clinical entity that cause serious respiratory, nutritional and immunologic complications. <b>Chylothorax</b> {{in the absence of}} trauma or tumour is uncommon and lymphangiomatosis of the bone, although extremely rare, has been associated with these condition. The authors describe the case of a two-year-old girl who presented with a massive <b>chylothorax</b> associated with hip and paravertebral lymphangioma and spread lymphangiomatosis of the spine. The authors also review the literature and their experience of congenital and postoperative <b>chylothorax</b> in order to establish guidelines for the diagnosis and management of both primary and postoperative <b>chylothorax</b> in paediatric age. METHODS: From 1990 and 1999, 14 children had <b>chylothorax.</b> 9 patients had pleural effusion after surgical procedure, 5 patients had congenital <b>chylothorax</b> (both in prenatal and neonatal time), one of whom with bone lymphangiomatosis associated. RESULTS: Postoperative <b>chylothorax</b> has been successfully treated by conservative approach (starvation, total parenteral nutrition and chest tube) in 6 out of 7 cases (two patients died because of complex cardiac malformation). Conservative approach is useful in case of congenital <b>chylothorax,</b> but not with bone lymphangiomatosis associated. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative and congenital <b>chylothorax</b> is well managed with conservative treatment. <b>Chylothorax</b> with bone lymphangiomatosis associated needs early and aggressive surgical approach...|$|E
