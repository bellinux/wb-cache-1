25|$|Reliability {{engineering}} is {{the discipline of}} ensuring a system meets <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> for reliability throughout its life; i.e., it does not fail more frequently than expected. Next to prediction of failure {{it is just as}} much about prevention of failure. Reliability engineering applies to all aspects of the system. It is closely associated with maintainability, availability (dependability or RAMS preferred by some), and logistics engineering. Reliability {{engineering is}} always a critical component of safety engineering, as in failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and hazard fault tree analysis, and of security engineering.|$|E

The helicopter that was eventually to enter production as the A119 was conceived in 1994, as Agusta was recovering from a period of financial woes that had nearly put the company out of business. In February 1995, the second of two prototypes conducted its first flight. The first prototype was used for static tests. Civil certification was originally anticipated in 1997, this deadline was missed allegedly due to multiple issues such as personnel problems, the need to concentrate resources {{on the development of}} the A109 Power, and further development to increase the aircraft's performance to meet <b>customer</b> <b>expectations.</b>|$|E

25|$|Former {{editor-in-chief}} Robert McHenry {{believes that}} Britannica failed to exploit its early advantages {{in the market}} for electronic encyclopedias. Britannica had, for example, published the second multimedia encyclopedia titled Compton's MultiMedia Encyclopedia as early as 1989 (the first one being the Academic American Encyclopedia published by Grolier), but did not launch Britannica CD until 1994, a year after Microsoft launched their Encarta encyclopedia. McHenry believes these failures were due to a reluctance among senior management to fully embrace the new technology, caused largely by the overriding influence of the sales staff and management. The sales personnel earned commissions from door-to-door selling of the print encyclopedias, which McHenry believes led to decisions about the distribution and pricing of the electronic products being driven by the desires of the sales personnel rather than market conditions and <b>customer</b> <b>expectations.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Performance {{engineering}} is {{the discipline of}} ensuring a system meets <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> for performance throughout its life. [...] Performance is usually defined as {{the speed with which}} a certain operation is executed, or the capability of executing a number of such operations in a unit of time. Performance may be degraded when an operations queue to execute is throttled by limited system capacity. [...] For example, the performance of a packet-switched network is characterized by the end-to-end packet transit delay, or the number of packets switched in an hour. The design of high-performance systems uses analytical or simulation modeling, whereas the delivery of high-performance implementation involves thorough performance testing. Performance engineering relies heavily on statistics, queueing theory and probability theory for its tools and processes.|$|E

Many firms now choose to set <b>customer</b> <b>expectation</b> by announcing their maximal delivery time. Customers will be satisfied if their perceived delivery times are shorter than their expectations. This gap model of service quality is used in this paper to study how a firm might choose a delivery-time commitment to influence its <b>customer</b> <b>expectation,</b> and delivery quality in order to maximize its market share. A market share model is developed to capture (1) the impact of delivery-time commitment and delivery quality on the firm's market share and (2) the impact of the firm's market share and process variability on delivery quality when there is a congestion effect. We show that the choice of the delivery-time commitment requires a proper balance between the level of service capacity and customer sensitivities to delivery-time expectation and delivery quality. We prove the existence of Nash equilibria in a duopolistic competition, and show that this delivery-time commitment game is analogous to a Prisoners' Dilemma. <b>customer</b> <b>expectation,</b> delivery-time commitment, queueing theory, gap model of quality...|$|R
