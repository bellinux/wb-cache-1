5|$|Although {{archaeology}} {{shows that}} the myth reflects an actual custom, the placement of coins with the dead was neither pervasive nor <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single coin in the deceased's mouth. In many burials, inscribed metal-leaf tablets or Exonumia {{take the place of}} the coin, or gold-foil crosses during the early Christian period. The presence of coins or a coin-hoard in Germanic ship-burials suggests an analogous concept.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, a {{dissident}} movement {{of a different}} kind emerged when a group of unemployed miners led by Vladimir Klebanov attempted to form a labor union and demand collective bargaining. The main groups of Soviet dissidents, consisting mostly of intellectuals, remained aloof, and Klebanov was soon <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mental institution. Another attempt a month later to form a union of white collar professionals was also quickly broken up by authorities and its founder Vladimir Svirsky arrested.|$|E

In November 1979, he retired from the AFL-CIO, after a 57-year career in organized labor. He was succeeded by Lane Kirkland, who served as AFL-CIO president for the next 16 years.|$|E
5|$|Andrić {{had been}} Yugoslavia's {{ambassador}} to Germany from 1939 to 1941, {{during the early}} years of World War II, and was arrested by the Germans in April 1941, following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. In June 1941, he was allowed to return to German-occupied Belgrade but was <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> friend's apartment in conditions that some biographers liken to house arrest. The novel was one of three that Andrić wrote over the next several years. All three were published in short succession in 1945, following Belgrade's liberation from the Nazis. The Bridge on the Drina was published in March of that year to widespread acclaim.|$|E

5|$|Changeling is a 2008 American mystery thriller film directed, co-produced {{and scored}} by Clint Eastwood and written by J. Michael Straczynski, that explores child endangerment, female disempowerment, {{political}} corruption, mistreatment {{of mental health}} patients, and the repercussions of violence. The script was based on real-life events, specifically the 1928 Wineville Chicken Coop Murders in Mira Loma, California. The film stars Angelina Jolie as a woman reunited with a boy whom she immediately realizes is not her missing son. When she tries to demonstrate this {{to the police and}} city authorities, she is vilified as delusional, labeled as an unfit mother, and then <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> psychiatric ward.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Quaternary period (0.7 {{million years}} ago), small emus {{lived on a}} number of {{offshore}} islands of mainland Australia. In addition to the King Island emu, these included taxa found on Kangaroo Island (D.n.baudinianus) and Tasmania (D.n.diemenensis), all of which are now extinct. The smallest taxon, the King Island emu, was <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small island situated in the Bass Strait between Tasmania and Victoria, approximately 100km (62mi) from both coasts. King Island was once part of the land bridge which connected Tasmania and mainland Australia, but rising sea levels following the last glacial maximum eventually isolated the island. As a result of phenotypic plasticity the King Island emu population possibly underwent a process of insular dwarfism.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati {{as a criminal}} defense attorney, defending several people accused of murder. In one case, he used a form of the insanity defense that saved the accused from the gallows; the woman was instead <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mental institution. Hayes also defended slaves who had escaped and were accused under the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, it was a destination for escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts. A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his {{work on behalf of}} fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|Hoffman {{provides}} the Group with information {{leading them to}} Pocatello, Idaho, {{where a group of}} even more cloned girls is found living in a commune. The police fear that a cult-involved suicide may be being planned, and they take the girls into protective custody. The girls are taken onto a bus as Black speaks to their biological father, a preacher <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> negative pressure ventilator (Morgan Woodward). The man reveals to Black that he attempted to create a caste of pure and innocent people who could repopulate society benevolently after the cataclysm. He contacted some of the girls to let them know he would die before the apocalyptic date, and they committed suicide shortly afterwards. That night, a power cut stops the man's ventilator, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Ibn al-Ash'ath {{remained}} {{safe under}} the protection of the Zunbīl, but al-Hajjaj, fearing that he might raise another revolt, sent letters to the Zunbīl, mixing threats and promises, to secure his surrender. Finally, in 704 the Zunbīl gave in, in exchange for lifting the annual tribute for 7 or 10 years. Accounts of Ibn al-Ash'ath's end differ: one version holds that he was executed by the Zunbīl himself, or that he died of illness, and that his head was cut off and sent to al-Hajjaj. The more widespread account, however, holds that he was <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> remote castle at Rukhkhaj in anticipation of his extradition to al-Hajjaj, and chained to his warden, but that he threw himself {{from the top of the}} castle (along with his warden) to his death.|$|E

5|$|In later years, Jenner {{developed}} Parkinson's {{disease and}} therefore retired from IBM. With money that Jessie had inherited, the couple moved to Bexley in 1953, where they began attending Bexley Gospel Hall. Towards {{the end of}} his life, Jenner developed dementia and his narcolepsy worsened. For six months, he was <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bed and was treated with amphetamine. He was then diagnosed with colorectal cancer and spent a subsequent ten days at Calvary Hospital, Kogarah, New South Wales, where he died at 11:45pm on 8 May 1977 at the age of 73. Because he had befriended so many police officers towards {{the end of his}} life, his body was given a police escort to the burial, which took place at Woronora Lawn Cemetery. His wife died two years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Africa, {{birds of}} both the European subspecies P. d. domesticus and the Indian subspecies P. d. indicus were introduced around 1900. Birds of P. d. domesticus ancestry are <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few towns, while P. d. indicus birds have spread rapidly, reaching Tanzania in the 1980s. Despite this success, native relatives such as the Cape sparrow also occur in towns, competing successfully with it. In South America, it was first introduced near Buenos Aires around 1870, and quickly became common {{in most of the}} southern part of the continent. It now occurs almost continuously from Tierra del Fuego to the fringes of the Amazon basin, with isolated populations as far north as coastal Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|Saumarez {{immediately}} {{moved to}} engage the French ship and managed to isolate the frigate and subject it to a fierce barrage of fire {{for more than two}} hours. Captain François A. Dénian on Réunion responded, but aside from inflicting minor damage to Saumarez's rigging achieved little while his own vessel was heavily battered, suffering severe damage to rigging masts and hull and more than 80 and possibly as many as 120 casualties. British losses were <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single man wounded by an accident aboard Crescent. Eventually Dénian could not hold out any longer and was forced to surrender on the arrival of the 28-gun British frigate HMS Circe. Réunion was later repaired and commissioned into the Royal Navy, while Saumarez was knighted for his success.|$|E

5|$|The finals of {{the first}} Italian Football Championship was decided {{in a single day}} with four teams competing, three from Turin and one from Genoa. The title was decided using a {{knock-out}} format between the finalists with Genoa, the inaugural winners. The knock-out format was used until the 1909–10 season, when a league consisting of nine teams was formed. The championship, which had been <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single league in the north of Italy, became a national competition in 1929 with the foundation of Serie A and Serie B.|$|E
5|$|This {{ability of}} Clostridium to metabolize sugars directly, or to produce acetic acid from less costly inputs, {{suggests}} that these bacteria could produce acetic acid more efficiently than ethanol-oxidizers like Acetobacter. However, Clostridium bacteria are less acid-tolerant than Acetobacter. Even the most acid-tolerant Clostridium strains can produce vinegar in concentrations {{of only a few}} per cent, compared to Acetobacter strains that can produce vinegar in concentrations up to 20%. At present, it remains more cost-effective to produce vinegar using Acetobacter, rather than using Clostridium and concentrating it. As a result, although acetogenic bacteria have been known since 1940, their industrial use is <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few niche applications.|$|E
