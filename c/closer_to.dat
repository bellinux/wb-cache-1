5|$|Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles {{begin to}} {{differentiate}}. <b>Closer</b> <b>to</b> {{the back of}} the embryo, they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals. <b>Closer</b> <b>to</b> the front of the embryo, the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary saccule, which will eventually become the saccule and cochlea. Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to the cochlear duct. This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens.|$|E

5|$|The Prosaurolophus-Saurolophus clade {{has been}} a {{problematic}} grouping when trying to place among hadrosaurines. Many skull features are similar to Edmontosaurus, while other are <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Gryposaurus, so the group has been classified as close to both. However, the clade might be <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Edmontosaurus, as the features are more numerous uniting them.|$|E
5|$|The p-adic {{numbers are}} an {{alternative}} number system {{of interest in}} number theory. Like the real numbers, the p-adic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via Cauchy sequences; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> p, and much <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> pn, {{than it is to}} 1. The p-adic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So arithmetic can be performed in the p-adics, and there are no infinitesimals.|$|E

The Persian alphabet is supported by the devoutly religious, Islamists, and by those who wish to bring the country <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Iran and their Persian heritage.
