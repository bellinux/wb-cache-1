40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the inflammatory response of rabbit bone after insertion of titanium screws under different torque values. METHODS: Four holes {{were made in}} the back tibia of fifteen New Zealand male albino rabbits; three screws were placed in each animal and a <b>control</b> <b>hole</b> remained without a screw. The screws were inserted with 0, 5 or 10 N. cm of torque. The animals were assigned to five groups according to the day of sacrifice after surgery (2, 7, 14, 21 or 42 days). The inflammatory cells and the thickness of the bone tissue around the screws was count. RESULTS: The screws were associated with a larger number of inflammatory cells when compared to the <b>control</b> <b>hole.</b> There was no statistically significant difference when several comparisons were made among the groups with different torque intensity. CONCLUSIONS: The histological changes were not statistically significant. There was a trend toward an increase in inflammatory cells found in local bone tissue surrounding the titanium screws installed with the highest torque. There was a tendency toward the formation of a lower thickness of tissue surrounding those bone screws that were inserted with higher torque...|$|E

One manifestation {{is the large}} {{anisotropy}} of Zeeman spin splitting. Using undoped, coupled quantum wells (QWs), we examine this anisotropy by comparing the hole spin dynamics for high- and low-symmetry crystallographic orientations of the QWs. We directly measure the hole $g$ factor via time-resolved Kerr rotation, and for the low-symmetry crystallographic orientations (110) and (113 a), we observe a large in-plane anisotropy of the hole $g$ factor, in good agreement with our theoretical calculations. Using resonant spin amplification, we also observe an anisotropy of the hole spin dephasing in the (110) -grown structure, indicating that crystal symmetry {{may be used to}} <b>control</b> <b>hole</b> spin dynamics...|$|E

High-performance, high-functionality and reliable complementary circuits require n- and p-type thin-film transistors with balanced characteristics. Recent advancements in ambipolar organic transistors in terms of semiconductor and device engineering demonstrate the great potential of this route but, unfortunately, the actual development of ambipolar organic complementary electronics is currently hampered by the uneven electron (n-type) and hole (p-type) conduction in ambipolar organic transistors. Here we show ambipolar organic thin-film transistors with balanced n-type and p-type operation. By manipulating air exposure and vacuum annealing conditions, we show that well-balanced electron and hole transport properties can be easily obtained. The method is used to <b>control</b> <b>hole</b> and electron conductions in split-gate transistors based on a solution-processed donor-acceptor semiconducting polymer. Complementary logic inverters with balanced charging and discharging characteristics are demonstrated.

The applicability of four models to hole-trap creation will be examined. These are the trapped hole-electron recombination model, the electrical field energy model, the hole injection model, and the hydrogen model. To testify these models, stresses have {{to be carried out}} not only under substrate hole injection (SHI), but also under Fowler-Nordheim injection (FNI). By combining FNI with SHI, {{we will be able to}} <b>control</b> <b>hole</b> fluency independent of the electron-induced hydrogen release. This allows us to determine how important hydrogen is for hole-trap generation. Although it was reported that hydrogen could play a major role in positive charge generation for devices with an Al gate or without a gate, we will show that hydrogen does not dominate hole-trap generation, when poly-si gated devices are stressed under our test conditions. Unambiguous results will also be given to show that key predictions of the recombination model and the electrical field energy model are not observed here. In this paper, the most important process for hole-trap generation is found to be the direct interaction of injected holes with the oxide. status: publishe...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is to highlight if PEMFs influence cell metabolic activity during the replacement of the blood clot with granulation tissue in the inflammation phase of bone repair. Four equal transcortical holes were made, at the same diaphyseal level, in both metacarpals (McIII) of five mate adult horses. The left McIII were exposed to PEMFs 24 hr/day; the right untreated McIII were used as controls. Eight days after surgery, the horses were sacrificed. We investigated the effect of PEMFs on 1) histological aspects of the lesion, 2) histochemical detection of the bone marker alkaline phosphatase, and 3) molecular markers as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR). The histological analysis indicates that the blood clot, in both PEMF treated and <b>control</b> <b>holes,</b> is being replaced by granulation tissue extending from the endosteal towards the periosteal side of the lesion. TALP positive areas do not exactly correspond to the areas where fibroblasts are present, these being wider than the former.

40|$|Abstract—Well known “hole ” {{problem is}} hardly avoided in {{wireless}} sensor networks because of various actual geographical environments. Existing geographic routing protocols (such as GFG [1] and GPSR [2]) use perimeter routing strategies to find a detour path around the boundary of holes when they encounter the “local minimum ” during greedy forwarding. However, this solution may lead to uneven energy consumption around the holes since it consumes more energy of the boundary sensors. It becomes more serious when holes appear in most of routing paths {{in a large scale}} sensor network. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed strategy to balance the traffic load on the boundary of holes by virtually changing the sizes of these holes. The proposed mechanism dynamically <b>controls</b> <b>holes</b> to expand and shrink circularly without changing the underlying forwarding strategy. Therefore, it can be applied to most of the existing geographic routing protocols which detour around holes. Simulation results show that our new strategy can effectively balance the load around holes thus prolong the network life of sensor networks when using with GPSR.

The interpretation {{is that there is a}} system of conductive fractures, which are relatively easy to fill with grout. They are connected by a network of less pervious channels, which make up low permeability connections between the conductive fractures. They are difficult to intersect by a borehole and are thus difficult to grout. Finally the findings support a conceptual model of the rock as a system of sparse conductive two-dimensional fractures connected by much less conductive one-dimensional channels...|$|R

From the white rotted areas, a fungus was isolated on PDA that formed cream-yellow to light-brown colonies with dense aerial mycelium.

Two transcortical holes (4. 5 mm diameter) were drilled at the same diaphyseal level in the lateral margin of the right and left metacarpal bone (McIII) of six adult male horses. The left McIII were exposed to PEMFs (75 Hz; 2. 8 mT, 1. 3 ms impulse width) 24 h/day; the right untreated McIII were used as controls. Horses were sacrificed 8 and 15 days after the operation. The bone segments containing the holes were fixed, dehydrated in ethanol solutions, and, undecalcified, embedded in methylmethacrylate. The midlongitudinal sections of the holes were either stained with soluidine blue or processed for evaluation of the total alkaline phosphatase (TRAP) and the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work on fibre transitions made in {{photonic crystal}} fibres (PCF) and conventional standard fibres. Three post-processing techniques {{were used to}} make the transitions: fibre tapering, ferrule drawing and a new technique – PCF hole inflation. All these methods change the fibre dimensions on a centimeter scale while maintaining very low loss. In the hole inflation technique, cladding holes are pressurized and can be enlarged while heat-treating, unlike other techniques where the holes can only be reduced in size. <b>Controlled</b> <b>hole</b> expansion was used to produce devices for applications such as supercontinuum generation. Furthermore, differential pressurization of holes could create a diversity of core shapes in a PCF section. For example they were investigated to improve interfacing of laser diodes to fibres. Differential pressurization was also used to introduce new cores into PCFs. Introducing a larger core asymmetrically by the original core resulted in a fundamental to second-order mode conversion with a high extinction ratio. Alternatively, similar mode conversion was demonstrated by fusing two unequal standard fibres. Also with standard fibres, low-loss multimode to single-mode fibre transitions were made using a modified fibre fabrication technique. These fibre transitions and optical devices have a wide range of potential applications, for example in supercontinuum generation and low-loss interfacing of fibres to other optical systems.

This challenge appears to have being well examined in case of straight hole-angle (Belavadi and Chukwu 1994), {{but in the case of}} highly deviated and horizontal portions of the well, removal of drilled cuttings is still a major problem (Ismail et al. 2016). Also, when drilling in highly deviated and horizontal portions of the annulus, the cleaning of the well worsens with increasing well depth and hole deviation (Ismail et al. 2016; Onuoha et al. 2015; Gavignet and Sobey 1989). Application of this form of drilling system is in most cases linked with serious drilling problems which often affect the performance of drilling muds. High torque and drag, barite sag, formation damage, lost circulation, slow drilling rate, increased equivalent circulating density (ECD), kick leading to blowout if not properly <b>controlled,</b> <b>hole</b> instability, and in terrible situation, differential stuck pipe, are several of the problems faced while drilling in highly deviated or horizontal wells (Ismail et al. 2016; Onuoha et al. 2015; Gavignet and Sobey 1989; Ford et al. 1990). If these problems are not properly addressed, it can get worse and probably lead to well side tracking or even loss of the entire well (Gatlin 1960). Thus, appropriate design of drilled cuttings transport strategy, such as incorporating optimum drilling fluid properties with the best drilling practice is crucial to obtaining a successful drilling operation.|$|R
