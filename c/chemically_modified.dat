5|$|Diamonds are {{naturally}} lipophilic and hydrophobic, {{which means the}} diamonds' surface cannot be wet by water, but can be easily wet and stuck by oil. This property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds. However, when diamond surfaces are <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> with certain ions, {{they are expected to}} become so hydrophilic that they can stabilize multiple layers of water ice at human body temperature.|$|E
5|$|Compared to B-DNA, the A-DNA form is a wider {{right-handed}} spiral, with a shallow, wide minor groove and a narrower, deeper major groove. The A form occurs under non-physiological {{conditions in}} partly dehydrated samples of DNA, {{while in the}} cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA strands, and in enzyme-DNA complexes. Segments of DNA where the bases have been <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> by methylation may undergo a larger change in conformation and adopt the Z form. Here, the strands turn about the helical axis in a left-handed spiral, {{the opposite of the}} more common B form. These unusual structures can be recognized by specific Z-DNA binding proteins and may be involved in the regulation of transcription.|$|E

25|$|By mutating aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, chemists have {{expanded}} the genetic codes of various organisms to include lab-synthesized amino acids {{with all kinds}} of useful properties: photoreactive, metal-chelating, xenon-chelating, crosslinking, spin-resonant, fluorescent, biotinylated, and redox-active amino acids. Another use is introducing amino acids bearing reactive functional groups for <b>chemically</b> <b>modifying</b> the target protein.|$|R
5|$|Oligonucleotide {{synthesis}} is {{the chemical}} synthesis of relatively short fragments of nucleic acids with defined chemical structure (sequence). The technique is extremely useful in current laboratory practice {{because it provides}} a rapid and inexpensive access to custom-made oligonucleotides of the desired sequence. Whereas enzymes synthesize DNA and RNA only in a 5' to 3' direction, chemical oligonucleotide synthesis does not have this limitation, although it is, most often, {{carried out in the}} opposite, 3' to 5' direction. Currently, the process is implemented as solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidite method and phosphoramidite building blocks derived from protected 2'-deoxynucleosides (dA, dC, dG, and T), ribonucleosides (A, C, G, and U), or <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> nucleosides, e.g. LNA or BNA.|$|E
5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein {{is defined by the}} sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E

25|$|A {{large number}} of the {{individual}} nucleotides in a tRNA molecule may be <b>chemically</b> <b>modified,</b> often by methylation or deamidation. These unusual bases sometimes affect the tRNA's interaction with ribosomes and sometimes occur in the anticodon to alter base-pairing properties.|$|E
25|$|Because the Edman {{degradation}} {{proceeds from}} the N-terminus of the protein, it will not work if the N-terminus has been <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> (e.g. by acetylation or formation of Pyroglutamic acid). Edman degradation is generally not useful to determine the positions of disulfide bridges. It also requires peptide amounts of 1 picomole or above for discernible results, making it less sensitive than mass spectrometry.|$|E
40|$|To study DNAs and RNAs it {{is often}} {{necessary}} to <b>chemically</b> <b>modify</b> them.

40|$|A report {{presents}} a short discussion of one company's {{effort to develop}} composites of carbon nanotubes in epoxy and other polymer matrices. The focus of the discussion is on the desirability of <b>chemically</b> <b>modifying</b> carbon nanotubes to overcome their inherent chemical nonreactivity and thereby enable the formation of strong chemical bonds between nanotubes and epoxies (or other polymeric matrix materials or their monomeric precursors). The chemical modification is effected in {{a process in which}} discrete functional groups are covalently attached to the nanotube surfaces. The functionalization process was proposed by the company and demonstrated in practice for the first time during this development effort. The covalently attached functional groups are capable of reacting with the epoxy or other matrix resin to form covalent bonds. Furthermore, the company uses this process to <b>chemically</b> <b>modify</b> the nanotube surfaces, affording tunable adhesion to polymers and solubility in select solvents. Flat-sheet composites containing functionalized nanotubes demonstrate significantly improved mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties...|$|R
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.integrifolia has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Studies on B.integrifolia suggest that its proteoid root mat achieves this by <b>chemically</b> <b>modifying</b> its soil environment.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the main}} methods of {{avoiding}} nonkosher gelatin is to substitute gelatin-like materials in its place; substances with a similar chemical behaviour include food starch from tapioca, <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> pectins, and carrageenan combined with certain vegetable gumsguar gum, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, gum acacia, agar, and others. Although gelatin is used for several purposes by {{a wide variety of}} manufacturers, it has started to be replaced with these substitutes in a number of products, due to the use of gelatin also being a significant concern to vegans and vegetarians.|$|E
500|$|The vast {{majority}} of DNA damage affects the primary structure of the double helix; that is, the bases themselves are <b>chemically</b> <b>modified.</b> These modifications can in turn disrupt the molecules' regular helical structure by introducing non-native chemical bonds or bulky adducts that do not fit in the standard double helix. Unlike proteins and RNA, DNA usually lacks tertiary structure and therefore damage or disturbance does not occur at that level. DNA is, however, supercoiled and wound around [...] "packaging" [...] proteins called histones (in eukaryotes), and both superstructures are vulnerable {{to the effects of}} DNA damage.|$|E
500|$|As {{shown on}} the right, enzymes with a {{ping-pong}} mechanism can exist in two states, E and a <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> form of the enzyme E*; this modified enzyme is known as an intermediate. In such mechanisms, substrate A binds, changes the enzyme to E* by, for example, transferring a chemical group to the active site, and is then released. Only after the first substrate is released can substrate B bind and react with the modified enzyme, regenerating the unmodified E form. When a set of v by [...] curves (fixed A, varying B) from an enzyme with a ping–pong mechanism are plotted in a Lineweaver–Burk plot, a set of parallel lines will be produced. [...] This is called a secondary plot.|$|E

2500|$|The {{development}} of plastics {{has evolved from}} the use of natural plastic materials (e.g., chewing gum, shellac) to the use of <b>chemically</b> <b>modified,</b> natural materials (e.g., natural rubber, nitrocellulose, collagen, galalite) and finally to completely synthetic molecules (e.g., bakelite, epoxy, polyvinyl chloride). Early plastics were bio-derived materials such as egg and blood proteins, which are organic polymers. In 1600 BC, Mesoamericans used natural rubber for balls, bands, and figurines. Treated cattle horns were used as windows for lanterns in the Middle Ages. [...] Materials that mimicked the properties of horns were developed by treating milk-proteins (casein) with lye.|$|E

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to obtain more potent {{antitumor}} compounds by <b>chemically</b> <b>modifying</b> asterriquinones. Amino-and aziridinyl-asterriquinone were newly synthesized, but showed no activity. However, dimethylallylation of asterriquinone Cl, which had no effect in vivo, yielded an active compound, with a change in pKa value from 5. 0 to 7. 2. This suggests that other active compounds may be obtained by the chemical modification of asterriquinones with various other functional groups...|$|R
2500|$|Stähelin quickly {{assumed the}} {{leading role in the}} {{discovery}} and development of Podophyllum compounds; four of them, including etoposide (Vepesid), were later marketed. He was able to detect in a partially purified, <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> extract of the Podophyllum plant the presence of a then-unknown agent with interesting properties, which had at first been considered by the chemists to be [...] "dirt". The chemists, under the direction of A. von Wartburg, analysed this impurity. Guided by Stähelin's in-vitro and in-vivo assays, they found the active compound responsible for the good antitumor activity of SP-G (Proresid oral) and SP-I (Proresid intravenous; discovered in April 1959, commercialized 1963). Further chemical modifications led to the well-known thenylidene derivative VM-26 (teniposide, Vumon, discovered in October 1965, commercialized by Sandoz in 1976) and to the ethylidene derivative VP-16-213 (etoposide, Vepesid, discovered on October 21, 1966), which remains very clinically successful.|$|E
2500|$|PAHs {{that affect}} cancer {{initiation}} are typically first <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> by enzymes into metabolites that react with DNA, leading to mutations. When the DNA sequence is altered in genes that regulate cell replication, cancer can result. Mutagenic PAHs, such as benzopyrene, usually have {{four or more}} aromatic rings {{as well as a}} [...] "bay region", a structural pocket that increases reactivity of the molecule to the metabolizing enzymes. Mutagenic metabolites of PAHs include diol epoxides, quinones, and radical PAH cations. These metabolites can bind to DNA at specific sites, forming bulky complexes called DNA adducts that can be stable or unstable. Stable adducts may lead to DNA replication errors, while unstable adducts react with the DNA strand, removing a purine base (either adenine or guanine). Such mutations, if they are not repaired, can transform genes encoding for normal cell signaling proteins into cancer-causing oncogenes. Quinones can also repeatedly generate reactive oxygen species that may independently damage DNA.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescence {{detection}} {{can also}} be used in capillary electrophoresis for samples that naturally fluoresce or are <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> to contain fluorescent tags. This mode of detection offers high sensitivity and improved selectivity for these samples, but cannot be utilized for samples that do not fluoresce. [...] Numerous labeling strategies are used to create fluorescent derivatives or conjugates of non-fluorescent molecules, including proteins and DNA. [...] The set-up for fluorescence detection in a capillary electrophoresis system can be complicated. [...] The method requires that the light beam be focused on the capillary, which can be difficult for many light sources. [...] Laser-induced fluorescence has been used in CE systems with detection limits as low as 10−18 to 10−21 mol. [...] The sensitivity of the technique is attributed to the high intensity of the [...] light and the ability to accurately focus the light on the capillary. [...] Multi-color fluorescence detection can be achieved by including multiple dichroic mirrors and bandpass filters to separate the fluorescence emission amongst multiple detectors (e.g., photomultiplier tubes), or by using a prism or grating to project spectrally resolved fluorescence emission onto a position-sensitive detector such as a CCD array. [...] CE systems with 4- and 5-color LIF detection systems are used routinely for capillary DNA sequencing and genotyping ("DNA fingerprinting") applications.|$|E
