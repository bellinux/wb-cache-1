40|$|Electron {{microscope}} studies {{been made}} of mock-infected or herpes implex virus (HSV) type 1 (strain 17) - or HSV- 2 (strain HG 52) -infected Flow 2002 cells grown in the absence or presence ofvarious concentrations of <b>cicloxolone</b> sodium (CCX). Fifty non-serial, thin sections of mock-infected orHSV-infected cells, which contained {{a portion of the}} nucleus, were examined by transmission electron microscopy. With increasing drug concentration, counts of capsid structures both in the nucleus and cytoplasm showed a {{decrease in the number of}} virions per cell section, an increase in the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic virus, a relative reduction in the percentage of cytoplasmic enveloped virus particles, but no effect on the ratio of empty to core-containing capsid structures. The high particle to p. f. u, ratio induced by CCX treatment is thus not explained through failure to assemble morphologically mature core-containing capsids. In part it can be explained by non-envelopment, but in addition, specific effects on other virion proteins (tegument and envelope) must be involved. The extracellular virus particle yield was unaffected, indicating that CCX treatment enhances the egress of HSV. In the presence of CCX the encapsidation f HSV DNA into DNase-resistan...|$|E
40|$|The related triterpenoid {{compounds}} carbenoxolone sodium (CBX) and <b>cicloxolone</b> sodium (CCX) {{have been}} investigated in clinical trials for treatment of herpes implex virus (HSV) infections. When the drugs were tested in vitro, two dose-related effects on BHK cells became apparent: the rate of cell growth was reduced and the drugs exhibited cytotoxicity at high concentrations. Flow 2002 cells, in contrast, were apparently unaffected by all drug concentrations tested. The effect of up to 3 days incubation with 100 gM-CCX on BHK cells was reversible. The presence of 500 IIM-CBX or 300 gM-CCX during the HSV replication cycle reduced the infectious virus yield to less than 0. 01 ~: CCX is the more potent anti-herpes agent. The contribution made by cytotoxicity to the overall antiviral effect (measured by 24 h yield) was negligible in Flow 2002 cells, and was relatively unimportant in BHK cells. The amount of HSV- 1 or HSV- 2 adsorbing to pretreated BHK cells was reduced by 20 ~ and 40 ~ respectively atthe highest drug concentrations. Neither 500 ~tM-CBX nor 300 gM-CCX treatment for 24 h completely inhibited HSV- 1 replication, but HSV- 2 replication was abolished. The drugs appear to be continuously active throughout the infectious cycle. Infectious HSV particles appeared to become inactivated uring or soon after egress from the cell. The two triterpenoid rugs lowered the number of virus particles made, and to a much greater extent reduced the infectious virus yield; thus, the progeny virus quality is greatly diminished. HSV- 2 infections were more readily inhibited by either CCX or CBX than were HSV- 1 infections...|$|E
40|$|Virucidal {{agents are}} {{chemical}} substances that attack and inactivate viral particles outside the cell (virions). In general {{this is accomplished}} by damaging their protein shells (capsid) or the substance penetrates the core itself, where it destroys the genetic material. Damage to the virion structure is also possible. These agents are used not only for traditional surface disinfection or sterilization of blood, blood products, and other medicinal products {{as well as in}} antiviral chemotherapy. They have also been used in recent times for inactivation of viruses in foodstuffs, detergents or cosmetics. Below is given an overview of the data currently available on the performance of these substances when used for the latter applications (cleaning and cosmetics). These include: * hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorites, cupric and ferric ions, per-acids * ethanol, parachlorometaxylenol in a sodium C 14 - 16 olefin sulfonate, glutaraldehyde, quaternary ammonium salts, chlorhexidine and chlorhexidine gluconate, curdline sulphate, glycerol, lipids, azodicarbonamide, <b>cicloxolone</b> sodium, dichlorisocyanuric acid (sodium salt), benzalkonium salts, disulfate benzamides and benzisothiazolones, congo red, ascorbic acid, nonoxynol- 9, para-aminobenzoic acid, bis(monosuccinamide) derivative of p,p’-bis(2 -aminoethyl) diphenlyi-C 60) (fullerene). * merocyanine, benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A, rose bengal, hypericin, hypocrellin A, anthraquinones extracted from plants, sulfonated anthraquinones and other anthraquinone derivatives * gramicidine, gossypol, garlic (Allium sativum) extract and its components: ajoene, diallyl thiosulfinate (allicin), allyl methyl thioulfinate, methyl allyl thiosulfinate, extracts of ledium, motherworth, celandine, black currant, coaberry and bilberry, extract of Cordia salicifolia, steam distillate from Houttuynia cordata (Saururaceae) and its component, 5, 6, 7 -trimethoxyflavone from Calicarpa japonica, isoscullarein (5, 7, 8, 4 ’-tetrahydroxyflavone) from Scutellaria baikalensis and isoscutellarein- 8 -methylether, alkaloids and phytosteryl ester compounds...|$|E
