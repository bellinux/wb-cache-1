50|$|The oiling {{problem was}} caused by the passage from the center <b>cam</b> <b>bearing</b> to the {{cylinder}} head being offset by an inch and too small. The motor oils of the era were low in detergents, but high in petroleum coke; when combined with short trips and infrequent oil changes, this led to blockage of this passage.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{documents the}} thermodynamic and fluid mechanic analysis of an engine lubrication system. A comprehensive thermofluid computer model {{was developed to}} provide a flexible design analysis tool for the accurate prediction of oil pressures, flow rates and temperatures at any point within any lubrication system. Technical and financial support for the study was provided by Jaguar Cars. A comprehensive literature review revealed that the past {{research in this field}} had concentrated on either the thermofluid analysis of the lubrication system by engine testing, or the detailed analysis of individual components. A small number of computer models were developed for the flow analysis of the whole lubrication system. However, these models had limited heat transfer prediction capabilities, some requiring measured engine temperature data, and were not flexible enough to be employed as design tools. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a flexible steady-state thermofluid design analysis tool, by integrating a flow analysis approach with a detailed analysis of the heat transfer within the engine block. Mathematical models of the thermofluid behaviour of the lubrication system components were developed and were implemented in a suite of FORTRAN computer programs which formed the design analysis package. A simple, linear flow model was initially developed to represent the system with a combination of laminar pipes, pumps, filters, journal bearings, crank-shaft transfer holes and <b>cam</b> <b>bearing</b> transfer holes. The linear program provided a rapid analysis tool, but the accuracy of the results were limited by the simplified flow characteristics of the system components. A more comprehensive and flexible non-linear flow model was developed, which solved for the unknowns with an iterative technique. Additional component models with non-linear flow characteristics, such as turbulent pipes, annular pipes, strainers, and oil coolers, were developed. The non-linear solution technique was proven to be robust and flexible and was subsequently used in all the analysis programs. The heat transfer to the oil within the pressurised part of the lubrication system is modelled by the heat transfer program. The engine block temperatures are calculated by the engine block program. This program accounts for the heat transfer to the oil splashed on to the internal surfaces of the engine. The engine geometry is represented by a series of block elements and modelled as a nodal resistance network. This capability has particular importance during the design stage, rapidly providing an estimate of the temperature profile through the engine block, results which were previously only available from expensive and slow FEA models. It was shown that both the Jaguar AJ 6 and V 8 engine lubrication systems could be analyzed in great detail. Engine tests showed that the predicted flow rates, pressures and temperatures were in excellent agreement with measured values. The overall accuracy of the results induced a high degree of confidence in the thermofluid model. The final analysis package was proven to be easy to use, robust, rapid, flexible and accurate. The design analysis package, developed during the course of this study, represents a unique stand-alone simulation tool which can rapidly analyze any engine lubrication system configuration. This package provides a valuable analysis tool which can be used to optimise system designs at the initial design stage and the diagnosis of performance problems during the development phase. Parametric studies can be easily carried out on the lubrication system and engine block configuration to identify areas which can enhance heat transfer to the oil. The steady-state analysis package forms an excellent platform for the development of a full transient model. This would allow a detailed analysis of the lubrication system during engine warm-up, with the aim of reducing engine emissions and determining minimum oil requirements...|$|E

All conventional engines are using crankshafts to convert the piston reciprocating motion to a rotating motion in the drive line, but crankshafts are responsible of side thrust force, vibrations and also they are not efficient in transferring the power to the drive line. Crank-less and free piston engines were a good example to overcome the crank shaft problems, but these new kinds of engines are facing a control and starting problems. Revetec engine is a new engine arrangement used to increase engine’s efficiency by replacing the crankshaft and the connecting rod used in conventional engines by cams to control the piston movement.

40|$|The six papers {{presented}} in this thesis consider the effects on elastohydrodynamic lubrication (ehl) of non-steady conditions. The vast majority of ehl investigations, both experiemental and theoretical, utilise steady state conditions, i. e. constant load, velocity, geometry and temperature. The lubricant is, however, in conditions that are far from those of steady state. Many components operate with varying load, velocity and geometry. Some examples are gears, rolling element <b>bearings,</b> <b>cams</b> and follower mechanisms and reciprocating seals. To predict the operation of these components {{it is necessary to}} consider the transient effects. The theory of elastohydrodynamic lubrication under non-steady conditions is {{presented in}} this thesis and applied to some practical cases. Papers A and B deal with the simulation of the lubrication in the contact between an impacting ball and a lubricated surface. These investigations give understanding of lubrication under impact loading and also fundamental understanding of the dynamics of an ehl contact. Paper C is an experimental investigation of the impacting ball problem. The deformation of the surfaces in the contact region is studied for different combinations of lubricant viscosities and impact velocities. Paper D and E deal with the breakdown mechanisms of a lubricant film. It is shown that lubricant film failure occurs at high sliding velocities if the load is non-stationary. This contradicts elastohydrodynamic theory since increasing sliding velocity implies increasing entrainment of lubricant and thus thicker lubricant film and less risk for failure. It is, however, shown in Paper E that starvation can be the reason why film failure occurs even if the conjunction is lubricated by a thick layer of lubricant.
