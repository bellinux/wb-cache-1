50|$|Indirect Liquid cooling (ILC) {{involves}} water <b>cooled</b> <b>racks</b> with (active) {{rear door}} or in-row heat exchangers which are water cooled. The {{advantage of the}} active rear doors {{is that all the}} heat from air cooled IT is immediately absorbed by the water circuit when it leaves the rack which eliminates the need for CRACs, also in partial ILC implementations. This makes cooling systems very efficient, and supports limited efficiency on the IT itself by assisting ventilation.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{known as}} the POWER7-IH, the Power 775 is a water <b>cooled</b> <b>rack</b> module, 34 inches wide, 54 inches deep and 3.5 inches (2U) high. Each drawer {{comprises}} up to eight nodes (single O/S images) with a MCM with four POWER7 CPUs each, and 16 DDR3 SDRAM slots per MCM {{for a total of}} 256 POWER7 cores and 2 TB RAM.

50|$|During its reconstruction, the Colonel {{had a new}} {{foundation}} poured, {{which created}} a basement. In the basement, he had ovens installed whose vents and chimney extended underground beneath Route 25 to a structure that once stood on the other side. In addition to the ovens, marble slabs and <b>cooling</b> <b>racks</b> were also installed. It is thought that at one time, the windmill basement was an operating bakery. During the flour rationing of World War I, the bakery supposedly produced bread for the Fabyan family and even for their two bears, Tom and Jerry. However, the extent of use of the mill's bakery is debatable due to an inadequate oven draft.|$|R
50|$|Angel food cakes {{are cooled}} upside down. Some tube pans have “feet” or “fingers” that extend {{off of the}} top rim of the pan. The “feet” are placed on a <b>cooling</b> <b>rack.</b> If the pan does not have “feet” it is {{customary}} for home bakers to place a glass soda bottle or something similar through the tube {{to ensure that the}} pan is elevated. The elevation provides sufficient air flow to the cake, so that it cools properly. If a non-stick pan or greased pan were used, the cake would fall out when inverted, leading to a collapsed cake.|$|E
50|$|Militarised TGS {{models have}} GVWs ranging from around 18- to 44-tonnes. Tractor trucks are {{available}} with GCWs of up to 250-tonnes. MAN turbocharged six-cylinder diesel engines are fitted across the range, with emissions options (dependant on territory) ranging from EURO 3 to EURO 5. Standard engine options for militarised TGS models are a MAN D20 rated at 440 hp or a MAN D26 rated at 480 hp. The D26 engine with rated at 540 hp is available for heavy equipment transporter applications, this including an extra <b>cooling</b> <b>rack.</b> A 16-speed ZF manual all-synchromesh gearbox is standard for the TGS range, this coupled to a MAN two-speed transfer box with selectable or permanent all-wheel drive. Axles are of the hub-reduction type, rear drive axles being single tyre specific if required. Examples with undriven front axles are also available. Suspension is by conventional leaf springs, complemented by shock-absorbers and anti-roll bars as required. Standard tyre size is 14.00 R 20, with options including 395/85R 20, 525/65R 20.5 and 12.00 R 24 twin tires for heavy equipment transporters.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMilitary electronics are frequently operated in excessively confined spaces aboard ships and aircraft. This limited space impacts significantly {{on the space}} available for cooling equipment. The optimal solution {{is the development of}} one universal, modular rack for shipboard or aviation use. with a modular design, upgrades to equipment could also be accompanied by an upgrade to the <b>cooling</b> <b>rack</b> itself with very little additional cost or difficulty. A water cooled avionics rack can provide sufficient cooling for any piece or combination of avionics equipment if enough water flow paths are used, the water is at the appropriated temperature and the water is properly distributed within the passages. To determine if the cooling medium, water, is sufficiently distributed within a modular <b>cooling</b> <b>rack,</b> an analysis of the flow and pressure distribution of the coolant is required. This thesis presents a computer code that has been developed as an initial step in the total design of a modular <b>cooling</b> <b>rack</b> for avionics equipment. It itself, the code details a specific design technique and allows for the determination of whether a proposed configuration, including source location, characteristics of the cooling water, and {{the size and shape of}} the proposed flow passages will indeed provide a proper distribution of the coolant.

50|$|This {{means that}} the water {{infrastructure}} becomes segmented. Instead of feeding each cooling setup in a parallel infrastructure, the inlets of different technologies or {{different parts of the}} infrastructure are connected to the return circuit of another part of the infrastructure. In essence, the output of a liquid <b>cooled</b> <b>rack</b> should not be routed to a cooling installation, but to a different type of liquid cooling environment. By chaining the segmented liquid circuits in larger environments, very high return temperatures can be achieved, which enables the practical and effective reusability of thermal energy and decreases investments needed to make large scale heat reuse a viable option.|$|R
50|$|Since {{there is}} no such thing as one {{solution}} for all, any platform should be designed with the optimal technology for its different elements. Therefore, each part of a platform should be set up with a mix of optimised technologies. For example, storage environments are least suitable to be cooled directly by liquid due to the low energy production and the common dependency on moving parts. These can be set up in water <b>cooled</b> <b>racks.</b> High volumes of servers which require the least maintenance can best be positioned in a Total Liquid Cooling environment. Varying specialised server systems which require constant physical access are best situated in Direct Liquid Cooled environments.|$|R
50|$|Professional sheet pans used in {{commercial}} kitchens typically {{are made of}} aluminum, with a 1 in raised lip around the edge, and in the United States come in standard sizes. The full-size sheet pan is 26 by 18 in, which is too large for most home ovens. A two thirds sheet pan (also {{referred to as a}} three quarter size sheet pan) is 21 by 15 in. A half sheet pan is 18 by 13 in; quarter sheets are 9 by 13 in. The half sheet is approximately the same size as mass-market baking sheets found in supermarkets, and the quarter sheet is a common size for rectangular, single-layer cakes. Other commercial kitchen equipment, such as <b>cooling</b> <b>racks,</b> ovens, and shelving, is made to fit these standard pans.|$|R

50|$|A {{difficulty}} with forced air fan <b>cooling</b> in <b>rack</b> equipment is that fans can fail due to age or dust. The fans themselves {{can be difficult}} to replace. In the case of network equipment, {{it may be necessary to}} unplug 50 or more cables from the device, remove the device from the rack, and then disassemble the device chassis to replace the fans.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{increased}} density of blade-server configurations can still result in higher overall demands for <b>cooling</b> with <b>racks</b> populated at over 50% full. This {{is especially true}} with early-generation blades. In absolute terms, a fully populated rack of blade servers is likely to require more cooling capacity than a fully populated rack of standard 1U servers. This is because one can fit up to 128 blade servers in the same rack that will only hold 42 1U rack mount servers.|$|R
40|$|Eleven <b>cooling</b> {{systems for}} <b>rack</b> mounted {{computer}} equipment were evaluated and compared for their cooling effectiveness and their energy use. The cooling systems were of various designs but all were "close coupled" or "enclosed", {{and they all}} ultimately transferred heat to the building chilled water system. The types of cooling systems tested were: <b>rack</b> <b>cooler</b> with air to water heat exchanger, row type <b>rack</b> <b>cooler</b> with air to refrigerant or air to water heat exchanger, rack rear door passive cooler with air to refrigerant or air to water heat exchanger, a prototype direct touch cooling system using refrigerant, and a design consisting of a shipping container type enclosure cooled with chilled water. A number of energy-efficiency metrics and test parameters were introduced and used for comparison. The energy-efficiency metrics follow industry-standard methods with some modifications. A set of three metrics calculates and compares energy efficiency using an algorithm of cooling provided divided by the electrical power needed. Another metric includes the power required for the rack-mounted electronic equipment, thus providing a metric for total power required. All of the devices were effective in cooling the information technology (IT) equipment. The overall energy use efficiency varied considerably for a given cooling device configuration...|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} computational fluid dynamics/heat transfer (CFD/HT) {{model for}} a unit cell of a data center with a hot aisle-cold aisle (HACA) layout is simulated. Inefficiencies dealing with the mixing of hot air present in the room, with the cold inlet air leading {{to a loss of}} cooling potential are identified. For existing facilities, an algorithm called the Ambient Intelligence based Load Management (AILM) is developed which enhances the net data center heat dissipation capacity for given energy consumption at the facilities end. It gives a scheme to determine how much and where the computer loads should be allocated, based on the differential loss in cooling potential per unit increase in server workload. While the gains predicted are validated numerically initially, experimental validation is conducted using server simulators. For new facilities, a novel layout of the data center is designed, which uses scalable pods (S-Pod) based cabinet arrangement and air delivery. For the same floor space, the S-Pod and HACA facilities are simulated for different velocities, and the results are compared. An approach to incorporate heterogeneity in data centers, both for lower heat dissipation and liquid <b>cooled</b> <b>racks</b> has been established. Various performance metrics for data centers have been analyzed and sorted {{on the basis of their}} applicability.

40|$|NASA {{recently}} assembled {{one of the}} world's fastest operational supercomputers to {{meet the}} agency's new high performance computing needs. This large-scale system, named Columbia, consists of 20 interconnected SGI Altix 512 -processor systems, {{for a total of}} 10, 240 Intel Itanium- 2 processors. High-fidelity CFD simulations were performed for the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) computer room at Ames Research Center. The purpose of the simulations was to assess the adequacy of the existing air handling and conditioning system and make recommendations for changes {{in the design of the}} system if needed. The simulations were performed with NASA's OVERFLOW- 2 CFD code which utilizes overset structured grids. A new set of boundary conditions were developed and added to the flow solver for modeling the roomls air-conditioning and proper cooling of the equipment. Boundary condition parameters for the flow solver are based on cooler CFM (flow rate) ratings and some reasonable assumptions of flow and heat transfer data for the floor and central processing units (CPU). The geometry modeling from blue prints and grid generation were handled by the NASA Ames software package Chimera Grid Tools (CGT). This geometric model was developed as a CGT-scripted template, which can be easily modified to accommodate any changes in shape and size of the room, locations and dimensions of the CPU racks, disk racks, coolers, power distribution units, and mass-storage system. The compute nodes are grouped in pairs of racks with an aisle in the middle. High-speed connection cables connect the racks with overhead cable trays. The cool air from the cooling units is pumped into the computer room from a sub-floor through perforated floor tiles. The CPU cooling fans draw cool air from the floor tiles, which run along the outside length of each rack, and eject warm air into the center isle between the racks. This warm air is eventually drawn into the cooling units located near the walls of the room. One major concern is that the hot air ejected to the middle isle might recirculate back into the <b>cool</b> <b>rack</b> side and cause thermal short-cycling. The simulations analyzed and addressed the following important elements of the computer room: 1) High-temperature build-up in certain regions of the room; 2) Areas of low air circulation in the room; 3) Potential short-cycling of the computer <b>rack</b> <b>cooling</b> system; 4) Effectiveness of the perforated cooling floor tiles; 5) Effect of changes in various aspects of the cooling units. Detailed flow visualization is performed to show temperature distribution, air-flow streamlines and velocities in the computer room...|$|R

50|$|An air handler, or air {{handling}} unit (often abbreviated to AHU), is a device used to regulate and circulate air {{as part of a}} heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. An air handler is usually a large metal box containing a blower, heating or <b>cooling</b> elements, filter <b>racks</b> or chambers, sound attenuators, and dampers. Air handlers usually connect to a ductwork ventilation system that distributes the conditioned air through the building and returns it to the AHU. Sometimes AHUs discharge (supply) and admit (return) air directly to and from the space served without ductwork.|$|R
40|$|Today’s large {{data centers}} are the {{computational}} hubs {{of the next}} generation of IT services. With the advent of dynamic smart <b>cooling</b> and <b>rack</b> level sensing, the need for visual data exploration is growing. If administrators know the rack level thermal state changes and catch problems in real-time, energy consumption can be greatly reduced. In this paper, we apply a cell-based spatio-temporal overall view with high-resolution time series to simultaneously analyze complex thermal state changes over time across hundreds of racks. We employ cell-based visualization techniques for trouble shooting and abnormal state detection. These techniques are based on the detection of sensor temperature relations and events to help identify the root causes of problems. In order to optimize the data center cooling system performance, we derive new non-overlapped scatter plots to visualize the correlations between the temperatures and chiller utilization. All these techniques have been used successfully to monitor various time-critical thermal states in real-world large scale production data centers and to derive cooling policies. We are starting to embed these visualization techniques into a handheld device to add mobile monitoring capability...|$|R
