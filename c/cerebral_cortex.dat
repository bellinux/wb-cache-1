5|$|The {{elaboration}} of the <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex</b> {{carries with it}} changes to other brain areas. The superior colliculus, which {{plays a major role}} in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates, shrinks to a small size in mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex.</b> The cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion (the neocerebellum) dedicated to supporting the <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex,</b> which has no counterpart in other vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex,</b> carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex.</b> The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex</b> and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E

50|$|Genetic Duplication {{could be}} an {{implicit}} factor in how the human <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortexes</b> are more advanced than early vertebrates 2. Geneticists have discovered that genes can sometimes duplicate themselves, and if this duplication occurs in gametes (ova or sperm), then this new gene can {{be passed on to}} the offspring of an organism 2.

5|$|Fezf2 is a {{gene that}} is {{regulated}} by TBR1. Fezf2 expression is observed in layer V of the <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex.</b> The <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex</b> is constructed in six layers. Fezf2 expression is restricted to layer V for proper development and migration of neurons of the corticospinal tract, which is derived from layer V neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control. Recent studies show that TBR1, expressed in layer VI, binds directly to the Fezf2 gene, preventing Fezf2 expression in layer VI. In this manner, TBR1 acts as a transcription repressor of Fezf2. Mutation of TBR1 results in Fezf2 expression in layer VI and malformation of the corticospinal tract. Abnormal activation of TBR1 in layer V eliminates corticospinal tract formation.|$|E

40|$|Cerebral {{ischemia}} {{induced by}} unilateral carotid occlusion in rats decreases in an asymmetric manner {{the number of}} beta-adrenergic receptors in microvessels prepared from <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortexes</b> ipsilateral and contralateral {{to the side of}} the ligature. In particular, the reduction is more pronounced in the left hemisphere in case of both right and left carotid ligature. The greater receptor decrease in the left side of the brain was shown to depend on the integrity of interhemispheric connections. We show that the changes in capillary beta-adrenergic receptors in response to unilateral carotid occlusion are qualitatively modified during aging. In particular, the asymmetry in the response pattern observed in young rats is lost. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon may be based on an age-related impairment in the transfer of neuronal information between the two sides of the brain...|$|R

5|$|The pallium is a {{layer of}} gray matter that lies {{on the surface of}} the {{forebrain}} and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ. In reptiles and mammals, it is called the <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex.</b> Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and spatial memory. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex</b> consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed.|$|E

5000|$|AVE {{consists}} of constant, repetitive stimuli {{of the proper}} frequency and sufficient strength to [...] "excite" [...] the thalamus and neocortex.

Some parts, such as the <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex</b> and the cerebellar cortex, consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space.

5|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the Af9 protein acts as a {{repressor}} of Tbr1 in the upper layers of the six-layer developing <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex,</b> thereby confining Tbr1 to the lower cortical layers (preplate, subplate, layer VI). This process is regulated through interaction of Af9 with the methyltransferase DOT1L, which methylates histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). Af9 association with DOT1L enhances methylation of H3K79 at the TBR1 transcription start site, thereby interfering with RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) activity and reducing TBR1 expression. Mutants of Af9 experience increased dimethylation of H3K79 and increased TBR1 expression.|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) causes {{central nervous}} system damage and neurobehavioral disorders, and {{sevoflurane}} protects the brain from ischemic injury. We investigated the effects of sevoflurane on EMP-induced brain injury. Rats were exposed to EMP and immediately treated with sevoflurane. The protective effects of sevoflurane were assessed by Nissl staining, Fluoro-Jade C staining and electron microscopy. The neurobehavioral effects were assessed using the open-field test and the Morris water maze. Finally, primary cerebral cortical neurons were exposed to EMP and incubated with different concentration of sevoflurane. The cellular viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level were assayed. TUNEL staining was performed, and the expression of apoptotic markers was determined. The <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortexes</b> of EMP-exposed rats presented neuronal abnormalities. Sevoflurane alleviated these effects, {{as well as the}} learning and memory deficits caused by EMP exposure.

40|$|Two {{cases of}} the {{juvenile}} form of amaurotic family idiocy were {{described in the present}} communication. 1) Case 1 was a 11 -year- 10 -month boy. His family history had consanguinities. He was slightly deteriorated before the onset of the disease. At the age of 5 years, the ataxia of gait was initially manifested. Later there developed the progressive mental deterioration and the “Blitz-Nick- Salaam Krämpfe”. On neurological examinations the marked cerebellar syndroms (ataxia, intention-tremor and hypotonia), the involuntary movements and the narrowing of the ocular vessels could be recognised. Case 2 was 10 -year- 7 -month girl. Her two brothers died of amaurotic family idiocy. She had been healthy until she complained of the myoclonic contractions of the tips of the fingers. The mental deterioration, the convulsive seizures and the visual disturbances were gradually appeared. The neurological examinations showed the involuntary movements, the hypotonia, the optic atrophies and the retinal degeneration. Both patients died six years after the onset of the disease. 2) The autopsy findings of the brains in both cases revealed macroscopically the generalised atrophy and the increased consistency. Microscopically the essential changes were observed in the neuronal swelling and the lipidosis. These changes were distributed ubiquitously throughout the central nerves system and were most markedly in the <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortexes,</b> decreasing by degrees caudally. Furthermore in the case 1, the severest damage was seen in the cerebellar cortex. In the cerebellum of case 1, the entire nerve cell elements except Golgi's cells and the nerve fivers were almost completely obliterated. The swelling of axons in the the <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortexes</b> was recognised in both cases. too. 3) The findings of the organs such as liver, spleen and others in case 2 revealed no lipid accumuration as seen in Niemann-Pick's disease. There were observed the degeneration of the retinal outer layer which was characteristic of the juvenile form of the disease. 4) From the results of the histochemical observations in both cases it was concluded that the intraneuronal substances consisted of the mixture of the sphingomyelin and PAS-positive substances that might be the glycolipid. A part of them and the substances in the fat granulle cells were assumed to be combined with the protein. 5) Above mentioned results, the clinical, the histological and the histochemical findings in both cases indicated the jnvenile form of the disease.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to measure the effects of a tomographic {{synchrotron}} irradiation on healthy mouse brain. The <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortexes</b> of healthy nude mice were irradiated with a monochromatic synchrotron beam of 79 keV at a dose of 15 Gy in accordance with a protocol of photoactivation of cisplatin previously tested in our laboratory. Forty-eight hours, one week and one month after irradiation, the blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability was measured in the irradiated area with intravital multiphoton microscopy using fluorescent dyes with molecular weights of 4 and 70 kDa. Vascular parameters and gliosis were also assessed using quantitative immunohistochemistry. No extravasation of the fluorescent dyes was observed in the irradiated area at any measurement time (48 h, 1 week, 1 month). It appears that the BBB remains impermeable to molecules with a molecular weight of 4 kDa and above. The vascular density and vascular surface were unaffected by irradiation and no gliosis was induced. These findings suggest that a 15 Gy/ 79 keV synchrotron irradiation does not induce important damage on brain vasculature and tissue on the short term following irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Objective(s) : Exposing {{to stress}} may be {{associated}} with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, high level of oxidative stress may eventually give rise to accumulation of oxidative damage and development of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. It has been presented that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) supports neurons against various neurodegenerative conditions. Lately, there has been growing evidence that changes in the cerebral neurotrophic support and especially in the BDNF expression and its engagement with ROS might be important in various disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, we aimed to investigate protective effects of BDNF against stress-induced oxidative damage. Materials and Methods: Five- to six-month-old male wild-type and BDNF knock-down mice were used in this study. Activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes, and the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) were assessed in the cerebral homogenates of studied groups in response to acute restraint stress. Results: Exposing to acute physiological stress led to significant elevation in the markers of oxidative stress in the <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortexes</b> of experimental groups. Conclusion: As BDNF-deficient mice were observed to be more susceptible to stress-induced oxidative damage, it can be suggested that there is a direct interplay between oxidative stress indicators and BDNF levels in the brain...|$|R

40|$|Loss of the {{survival}} motor neuron gene (SMN 1) {{is responsible for}} spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the most common inherited cause of infant mortality. Even though the SMA phenotype is traditionally considered as related to spinal motor neuron loss, it remains debated whether the specific targeting of motor neurons could represent the best therapeutic option for the disease. We here investigated, using stereological quantification methods, the spinal cord and <b>cerebral</b> motor <b>cortex</b> of ∆ 7 SMA mice during development, to verify extent and selectivity of motor neuron loss. We found progressive post-natal loss of spinal motor neurons, already at pre-symptomatic stages, and a higher vulnerability of motor neurons innervating proximal and axial muscles. Larger motor neurons decreased {{in the course of}} disease, either for selective loss or specific developmental impairment. We also found a selective reduction of layer V pyramidal neurons associated with layer V gliosis in the <b>cerebral</b> motor <b>cortex.</b> Our data indicate that in the ∆ 7 SMA model SMN loss is critical for the spinal cord, particularly for specific motor neuron pools. Neuronal loss, however, is not selective for lower motor neurons. These data further suggest that SMA pathogenesis is likely more complex than previously anticipated. The better knowledge of SMA models might be instrumental in shaping better therapeutic options for affected patients...|$|R
