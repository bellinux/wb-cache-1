25|$|This {{pioneering}} setup {{gave way}} in 1958 {{to a system}} called 'GuideMatic' in reference to GM's Guide lighting division. The GuideMatic had a more compact dashtop housing and a <b>control</b> <b>knob</b> that allowed the driver to adjust the system's sensitivity threshold to determine when the headlamps would be dipped from high to low beam {{in response to an}} oncoming vehicle. By the early 1970s, this option was withdrawn from all GM models except Cadillac, on which GuideMatic was available through 1988. The photosensor for this system used an amber lens, and the adoption of retro-reflective yellow road signs, such as for oncoming curves, caused them to dim prematurely - possibly leading to their discontinuation.|$|E
500|$|Crossing {{over the}} eastern coast of Africa, {{he began to}} feel overheated; this problem was also {{apparent}} to the ground controllers, who were having a debate with the flight surgeon over whether it was safe to continue or if the mission should be ended after the first orbit. The flight director, Christopher Kraft, followed the surgeon's advice to see if the problem would settle, and gave the go for a second orbit. Schirra eventually stabilized the problem over time, slowly dialing the suit's <b>control</b> <b>knob</b> to a high cooling setting; he compared the heat to that of [...] "mowing a lawn in Texas".|$|E
500|$|The {{control box}} for the {{automatic}} pilot was {{recovered from the}} wreckage. [...] The <b>control</b> <b>knob</b> for its gyroscope was in the caged position and the CAGED warning flag was in view even though the control box carried a placard stating the gyro must be uncaged before takeoff. [...] The automatic pilot's speed valve unit was also recovered; it showed that the three valves were open in positions indicating the unit was operating {{at the time of}} the crash. [...] The investigation panel proposed that the automatic pilot might have been engaged at a height of about 400ft (120m) causing the aircraft to descend swiftly into the sea. Engagement could have occurred inadvertently when one of the pilots intended to select fuel cross-feed ON. The operating levers for fuel cross-feed and automatic pilot were the same shape, the same height above the cockpit floor, and about 12 inches (305mm) apart on the cockpit control console.|$|E

500|$|The UK {{edition of}} Are You Experienced opened with [...] "Foxy Lady", a track that, with the {{exception}} of a few overdubs, was recorded in one session at CBS. Hendrix wrote the song about Heather Taylor, a highly desirable London socialite who later married the Who's Roger Daltrey. It begins with the fade-in of an F note that Hendrix is bending-up to F while applying generous finger vibrato. Using his guitar's <b>control</b> <b>knob,</b> he slowly increases volume until an audio feedback loop develops and he slides into the song's dominant Fm7 chord. Hendrix used a combination of natural amplifier overdrive and fuzz box effects units to create the song's razor-sharp guitar tone. Its blues–inspired solo—his fourth since arriving in England—used pentatonic scales while showcasing his innovative approach to melody; by exploiting the increased sustain created by overdriving his amplifiers, he moved seamlessly between the middle and high registers with a fluid, singing tone. While author Peter Doggett compared its slow beat to Memphis soul, David Stubbs described the track as a prototype for heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{testing a}} sample, the Spectronic 20 is {{calibrated}} using a blank solution, {{which is the}} pure solvent that {{is used in the}} experimental sample. [...] It is typically water or an organic solvent. [...] In this calibration, the transmittance is set at 100% using the calibration knob of the instrument (the amplifier <b>control</b> <b>knob</b> in the figure at right). The instrument can also optionally be calibrated with a stock solution of a sample at a concentration known to have an absorbance of 2 or else vendor supplied standards, using the light absorption knob in the diagram shown at right. After calibration, the user places a 1/2 inch test tube or cuvette containing the sample solution to be measured into the sample compartment. Calibration is repeated each time the wavelength is changed. It or a standard reference sample is generally used to periodically check for drift. To measure wavelengths above 650 nm, the bottom of the instrument is opened, and a red filter and a red-sensitive photocell is installed.|$|E

40|$|Author for {{correspondence}} Instrument {{controls in}} motor vehicles have haptic properties (force and compliance) {{designed to enhance}} the ease of use. In conventional <b>control</b> <b>knobs,</b> these properties are obtained mechanically via springs, detents, hard stops and the like. The work reported here concerns {{the use of a}} single force-feedback knob to emulate the feel of various conventional <b>control</b> <b>knobs,</b> thus retaining their desirable haptic properties while allowing multiple functions to be controlled through one device. Compared to existing haptic knobs, this one is novel in its use of a brake to provide high torque capability in a small volume...|$|R
