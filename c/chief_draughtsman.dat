5|$|Following the {{grouping}} of railway companies in 1923, the LSWR {{became part of}} the Southern Railway (SR) and its publicity department gave the N15locomotives names associated with Arthurian legend; the class hence becoming known as King Arthurs. The Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the newly formed company, Richard Maunsell, modified the Urie locomotives in the light of operational experience and increased the class strength to 74 locomotives. Maunsell and his <b>Chief</b> <b>Draughtsman</b> James Clayton incorporated several improvements, notably to the steam circuit and valve gear.|$|E
5|$|The {{modifications}} {{are attributed}} to Maunsell’s <b>Chief</b> <b>Draughtsman</b> James Clayton, who had transferred to Ashford railway works in 1914 from Derby works. They {{were the result of}} cooperation between the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) and the Great Western Railway (GWR) when Maunsell was seconded to the Railway Executive Committee during the First World War. The aim was to create a series of standard freight and passenger locomotives for use throughout Britain, and meant that Clayton was privy to the latest GWR developments in steam design. These included streamlined steam passages, long-travel valves, the maximisation of power through reduced cylinder sizes and higher boiler pressure.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the prior}} {{introduction}} of the Princess Royal class had provided the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with more powerful locomotives to be used on the main line between London Euston and Glasgow Central, {{the board of directors}} were persuaded in 1936 that more such locomotives would be needed, particularly as they were being asked to approve the introduction of a new non-stop service between those cities, designated the Coronation Scot. Initially, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, William Stanier, planned to build five more Princess Royals, but the Chief Technical Assistant and <b>Chief</b> <b>Draughtsman</b> at the LMS Derby Works, Tom Coleman, argued that it would be preferable to design a new class of locomotive that was more powerful, more reliable and easier to maintain. Stanier was convinced and the drawing office commenced designing the new class. When Stanier was called on to perform an assignment in India, Coleman became responsible for most of the detailed design in his absence.|$|E
50|$|In 1914, he {{rejoined the}} SECR {{and was soon}} <b>Chief</b> Locomotive <b>Draughtsman.</b> From 1919, he was Chief Mechanical Engineer Richard Maunsell's {{personal}} assistant, and later his deputy.

5|$|Moving {{north to}} Auckland, Heaphy's {{new role as}} the <b>chief</b> <b>draughtsman</b> for the Auckland Survey Office, kept him {{occupied}} with the preparation of maps and plans. After a few years, he began to spend a greater {{amount of time in}} the field, where he carried out survey work. As he had done when living in Nelson, he supplemented his income with commissioned artworks. He began to build on his geological knowledge, taking a particular interest in vulcanology and wrote an article on Auckland's volcanoes for a geological journal in England. He completed several paintings of volcanoes as well as thermal attractions in the Bay of Plenty including the famous Pink and White Terraces. Hoping to raise his profile, he sent many of his works to London and some remain on display at the offices of the Geological Society.|$|E

50|$|William Sayer had won Claremont at the 1901 state election, {{in order}} to {{continue}} serving as attorney-general in the government of George Throssell. He had been appointed to the position a month before entering parliament. However, Throssell's government was short-lived (and thus so was Sayer's time in the ministry), and he resigned from parliament on 26 May 1902 to take up the position of <b>chief</b> parliamentary <b>draughtsman.</b> The writ for the by-election was issued on 28 May, with the close of nominations on 5 June. Polling day was on 11 June, with the writ returned the following day.|$|R
25|$|Diminutive, thin-sectioned {{symmetrical}} wing airfoils {{were designed}} for high-speed flight. The elevator control circuit was designed by Heston Aircraft Company's <b>Chief</b> <b>Draughtsman,</b> C.G.W Ebbutt, with a variable ratio- with the stick near the neutral position, large movements could be made with small resulting pitch movements. This was needed for accurate handling at low level and high speed (the 3km airspeed record course had to be flown under 100ft above sea level). Towards {{the ends of the}} control column movement, the ratio increased to allow utilization of the full range of elevator travel.|$|E
25|$|The LB {{achieved}} early fame as {{the first}} railway to use the Jenny Lind 2-2-2 locomotive in 1847, designed by David Joy, the <b>Chief</b> <b>Draughtsman</b> of the E.B.Wilson and Company of Leeds, later widely used by other railways. The policy of John Chester Craven, Locomotive Superintendent from 1847 to 1869, was to design locomotives for each task or type of traffic. Many of his designs were capable locomotives, but with 72 different classes in use {{at the time of}} William Stroudley's appointment in 1870, the policy was hopelessly uneconomic.|$|E

5000|$|Bernard O'Dowd {{was born}} in 1866 at Beaufort, Victoria, as the eldest son of Irish migrants, [...] Bernard O'Dowd and Ann Dowell. O'Dowd had been a child prodigy who read Milton's [...] "Paradise Lost" [...] at age 8. [...] He had been {{employed}} as a head teacher at a Catholic School in Ballarat, but he was dismissed for heresy. He then opened up his own school in Beaufort. In the year 1886, at age 20, he moved to Melbourne, where in 1887, he gained employment as an assistant-librarian in the Supreme Court Library, working with the Victorian colonial and State government until 1935, and retiring as <b>Chief</b> Parliamentary <b>Draughtsman.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After World War II Nock rose {{through the}} Westinghouse {{organisation}} to become <b>chief</b> brake <b>draughtsman</b> (1945), four years later chief draughtsman; during the British Rail modernisation plan (1955) Nock managed {{the expansion of the}} company's drawing office, and in 1957 became the company's chief mechanical engineer. Nock's first published book was Locomotives of Sir Nigel Gresley published 1945, and based on an earlier series of ten articles in The Railway Magazine; he became a regular author of publishers David and Charles and Ian Allan in the post war boom, publishing on average two books per year whilst working at Westinghouse.

25|$|Production was {{relocated}} to Holyhead Road in Coventry, where from 1922 to 1923 they {{also made the}} Buckingham car. In 1922 George Thomas Smith-Clarke (1884–1960) left {{his job as a}}ssistant works manager at Daimler and joined Alvis as chief engineer and works manager. Smith-Clarke was accompanied by William M. Dunn, who also left his job as a draughtsman at Daimler to become <b>chief</b> <b>draughtsman</b> at Alvis. This partnership lasted for nearly 28 years and was responsible for producing some of the most successful products in the company's history. Smith-Clarke left in 1950, and Dunn assumed Smith-Clarke's position as chief engineer, remaining in that position until 1959.|$|E
25|$|The Decapod {{developed}} mainly under <b>Chief</b> <b>Draughtsman</b> Frederick Vernon Russell was {{an extraordinary}} endeavour to develop a steam locomotive which could perform {{at the level of}} electric traction. It was built in 1902 to forestall an imminent scheme for an electrified railway out of London to suburbs served by the GER. Since the proponents of the scheme had a slogan about electric trains accelerating to thirty miles an hour in thirty seconds, Holden resolved to obtain the same performance with steam traction. A massive boiler with Wootten firebox, three cylinders each with its own blastpipe cone, and ten smallish driving wheels ensured a lively acceleration. On trial it did rather better than 30mi/h (50km/h) in thirty seconds, accelerating at 1.46ft/s² (0.45m/s²): This performance {{put an end to the}} electrification scheme even though (as Holden had known all the time) the regular use of so massive a machine would never have been permitted by the civil engineer.|$|E
25|$|Kennedy {{was born}} in Stepney, London to Rev. John Kennedy, MA, and Helen Stodart Blackie, both from Aberdeen. His {{maternal}} uncle was John Stuart Blackie the Scottish scholar. He received his early education at the City of London School, before taking a short course at the Royal School of Mines, Jermyn Street {{to give him a}} basic grounding in engineering. In 1864, he was apprenticed into the shipbuilding firm of J & W Dudgeon of Cubitt Town. He spent the next four years there working as a draughtsman and had a hand {{in the construction of the}} first ships with compound engines and twin screws. By the time he left in 1868 he was one of a few draughtsmen in the country with a thorough understanding of the workings of both systems. He put this understanding to good use when he joined Palmers' Engine Works of Jarrow on Tyne upon completion of his apprenticeship, he became the leading draughtsman and designed the first compound engine to be built in the north. Having spent three years with Palmers he worked for a short time for T.M. Tennant and Company of Leith as their <b>chief</b> <b>draughtsman.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1917 the SECR Board {{decided that}} when the London to Dover and Folkestone boat trains were {{reinstated}} after the war, they would be centred on London Victoria railway station, using the LCDR lines. This created a serious problem of producing a locomotive with sufficient power but with an acceptable axle load. Richard Maunsell therefore ordered the rebuilding one example with a larger cylinders, boiler and firebox, whilst {{at the same time}} reducing unnecessary weight elsewhere in the locomotive. This work was largely undertaken by his <b>Chief</b> Locomotive <b>Draughtsman</b> James Clayton. The experimental rebuilding was implemented following the Armistice in November 1918 and proved to be successful. A further ten examples were rebuilt by Beyer, Peacock and Company during 1919 and 1920, and ten more were supposed to follow in 1921, although at the last minute ten further D class locomotives were rebuilt instead.|$|R
5|$|Maunsell's <b>Chief</b> Locomotive <b>Draughtsman,</b> James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|R
500|$|The Kclass was {{designed}} by Maunsell's team in 1914 {{as part of his}} proposed standardisation programme following the Nclass, but the designs were not shown to the railway directors until early 1915 to enable all six designs to be shown at once. The design incorporated the principles of power and reliability established by George Churchward, using a Belpaire firebox that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version, a regulator located in the smokebox, long-travel valves for free running at high speeds, a sharply tapered and domeless boiler, and a right-hand driving position. The inclusion of these features is attributed to Holcroft, Maunsell's personal assistant, who had worked on the GWR 4300class and the Nclass. James Clayton, Maunsell's <b>Chief</b> Locomotive <b>Draughtsman,</b> brought simpler and more functional Midland Railway influences to the design, such as the shape of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler.

500|$|Although R. J.

500|$|Selfe {{very quickly}} {{began his career}} as an engineer, taking {{articles}} of apprenticeship to the ironmaster Peter Nicol Russell, at whose firm he worked in several departments and eventually became its <b>chief</b> <b>draughtsman.</b> He would remain there until 1864. In 1859, when PN Russell & Co expanded to a site in Barker Street near the head of Darling Harbour, Selfe drew up plans for the new works and the wharf, and oversaw their construction. In an address to the Engineering Section of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1900, Selfe recalled his work for Russell's: ...|$|E
500|$|Maunsell's {{modifications}} included {{increasing the}} boiler pressure from [...] to , and {{the reduction of}} the cylinder bore by half an inch. [...] The footplate was also modified for operation on the Southern's new composite loading gauge, and differed from previous batches in having the Ashford-style cab, which was usually fitted to LBSCR locomotives. Unlike the original Drummond cab that was also favoured by Urie, the Ashford-style cab was of an all-steel construction and had a roof that was flush with the cab sides. It was inspired by the standard cab developed in 1904 by R. M. Deeley for the Midland Railway, and was {{one of a number of}} Midland features introduced by Maunsell's <b>chief</b> <b>draughtsman</b> James Clayton, who transferred to Ashford Works in 1914 from the Midland Railway. Variants of this cab became standard for all new Southern Railway locomotives and converted tank engines.|$|E
5000|$|William Edmond Logan was in Montreal at {{the time}} and made it known that he was {{interested}} in participating in this survey. Gaining recommendations from prominent British scientists, Logan was appointed the first GSC director on April 14, 1842. Four months later, Logan arrived in Kingston, Ontario, to compile the existing body of knowledge of Canada's geology. In the spring of 1843, Logan established the GSC's headquarters in Montreal (in his brother's warehouse and then in a rented house on Great St. James Street (now Saint Jacques Street). One of the prominent cartographers and the <b>chief</b> topographical <b>draughtsman</b> was Robert Barlow, who began his work in 1855. Chemist T. Sterry Hunt joined in the early days and the Survey added paleontological capability in 1856 with the arrival of Elkanah Billings. [...] After Aylesworth Perry was appointed as acting librarian in 1881 he prepared the catalogue of reference works on geology, mineralogy, metallurgy, chemistry and natural history. George Mercer Dawson became a staff member in 1875, progressed to assistant director in 1883 and finally to director of the Geological Survey of Canada in 1895.|$|R
50|$|Smeaton was {{replaced}} by James Brindley as the engineer for the Calder and Hebble project in 1765, and again {{there is no direct}} evidence to link the two men at this stage, but plans for the Huddersfield Broad Canal, produced for Sir John Ramsden in 1766, are variously attributed either to Brindley or to Whitworth, and by 1767, Whitworth had become the <b>chief</b> surveyor and <b>draughtsman</b> within Brindley's organisation. There are a number of cases where Brindley was able to obtain commissions for survey work because of his reputation, but the work was then delegated to Whitworth to carry out. During this period he produced plans for the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal's Birmingham to Aldersley Junction route, the canal from Coventry to Fradley Heath on the Trent and Mersey Canal, the Droitwich Barge Canal and the Oxford Canal. He also attended Parliament to assist Brindley during the 1767-68 session.|$|R
50|$|In 1768, the {{engineer}} Robert Whitworth, who {{by this time}} was James Brindley's <b>chief</b> surveyor and <b>draughtsman,</b> was asked to assess the project. He reported that the river section was not suitable for navigation, and should {{be replaced by a}} canal, for which he suggested two routes and a cost of £22,000, and that beyond Sprucefield the navigation should be constructed as a canal, either on the north bank of the Lagan, or on the south, which would involve building an aqueduct at Spencer's Bridge to cross the river. Although attempts were made to raise the necessary finance, and two Acts of Parliament were obtained in 1772 and 1774, to give additional powers to local commissioners, no real progress was made, and in 1779, the 'Company of Undertakers of the Lagan Navigation' was formed. The Marquess of Donegall was the chief shareholder, and most other members were either landed gentry or drawn from the nobility, and so had considerable financial resources.|$|R
2500|$|The Westland Wagtail was {{designed}} by Westland Aircraft of Yeovil in 1917 to meet the Royal Air Force Specification IA for a light fighter with superior performance to the Sopwith Camel.

2500|$|In 1893 William Doxford and Sons Ltd.

His design retained conventional bows and sterns instead of the upswept conoid [...] "snout" [...] of the whaleback. Instead of a rounded hull, the hull of a turret vessel was stepped inward above the waterline, but the horizontal and vertical surfaces of the hull met in curves rather than by right angles as in conventional ships. Finally, the design joined the rounded turrets of whalebacks into one long and narrow rectangular structure (also called a [...] "turret") of about half the beam, and used that space {{as part of the}} hold.|$|E

He later reduced the figure to 32, and in March 1910 the decision was taken to reduce the number again to 16. Carlisle is believed to have left his position in dispute of this decision. [...] The White Star Line preferred to maximise the amount of deck space available for the enjoyment of the passengers (and the area that was free of lifeboats was, not coincidentally, the First Class promenade).
