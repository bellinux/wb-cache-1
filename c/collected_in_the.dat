It grows as an upright bush up to 2m (7ft) tall, with narrow leaves and a pale brown flower spike, which can produce profuse quantities of nectar. First <b>collected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1840s, it was not published as a separate species until 1981; as with several other similar species it was previously included in B.sphaerocarpa (Fox Banksia).|$|E
