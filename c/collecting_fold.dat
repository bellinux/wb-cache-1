50|$|The South Mountain {{field is}} one of several oil fields within the Oak Ridge Anticline, a large {{anticlinal}} structure upthrown over the Oak Ridge reverse fault. Tectonic forces caused by the collision and lateral movement of the North American and Pacific Plates have compressed the area of the Oxnard and Ventura Basins from north to south, resulting in structural folds; oil has <b>collected</b> in those <b>folds</b> which form an anticlinal trapping mechanism. Extensive faulting is a secondary trapping mechanism, as the fault offsets have brought impermeable rock adjacent to oil-bearing formations, preventing further upward migration of hydrocarbons.|$|R

40|$|SummaryAim: Verify {{the use of}} {{immunohistochemistry}} as {{a method}} to measure all forms of elastic fibers at human vocal folds. Study design: transversal cohort. Material and method: We <b>collected</b> vocal <b>folds</b> following these criterion: age between 25 and 40, Caucasian men, dead by gun shot, within 12 hours of death, without instrumentation of the larynx or suspicion of neck injury and without mucosal lesions noted by microscopy. Ten vocal <b>folds</b> were <b>collected</b> and one, of a man aged 28 years, was selected to study. The vocal fold was transversely cut in 9 regions and in each segment three slides were made. These slides were stained by Verhoeff and Weighert´s resorcin-fuchsin and used for immunohistochemistry. The elastic compound was measured by colorimetric software analysis. Results: In Verhoeff and Weighert´s resorcin-fuchsin, the intermediate and deep layer showed values {{higher than those of}} the superficial layer. The amount of tropoelastin identified by the antibody at the superficial layer was close to those of intermediate and deep layer. Conclusions: Immunohistochemistry is a method that can identify and measure all forms of elastic fibers at human vocal fold...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThis {{research}} project had two different parts: The first {{was about the}} mapping of {{a section of the}} Warm Zand Structure and the collection of strain data. The second part focused on the analysis of the finite strain and strain pattern in the Warm Zand Structure. The Warm Zand Structure consists of strongly deformed calc-silicates of the Puntsit formation and feldpathic quarzites of the Goede Hoop formation which gradually change into pure quartzites in some locations. The second phase of folding F 2 in the calc-silicates gave open folds. Strain markers are very scarce in the Warm Zand Structure; on the Emmanuel Farm pebbles were not found. However on the Compion Farm, pebbles are scattered and occur in few number. In the study area boudins were found in loose rocks hence they could not be used to estimate orientation of the XY plane of the strain ellipsoid (Ramsay, 1967). Folds on the other hand was common and was used to investigate the bulk shortening of the rocks and to understand the kinematical folding mechanisms involved in the folding process of the rock in the Warm Zand Structure. The strain contour map and the Sherwin and Chapple graph were used to investigate the strain and viscosity contrast respectively. The viscosity contrast of the <b>folds</b> <b>collected</b> in the Puntsit falls between 100 - 53 whereas the bulk shortening on the other hand is between 60 - 53 %. The values of the shortening found agree with those found by van Bever Donker (1980). The numerical modelling on the other demonstrated that in addition to layer parallel shortening and the flattening mention by van Bever Donker (1980) Tangential Longitudinal Strain and Flexural Flow are also involved in the folding process of the <b>fold</b> <b>collected</b> in the Puntsit Formation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the morphostratigraphy, lithostratigraphy and sedimentary structures of Terna River basin in the Deccan Basaltic Province (DBP) of West Central India. These Quaternary deposits have been {{divided into three}} informal formations (i) dark grey silt formation – Late Holocene, (ii) Light grey silt formations – Early Holocene, (iii) Dark grayish brown silt formation – Late Pleistocene with the older Quaternary Alluvial deposits of Upper Pleistocene age. The fine clay and silt formations in the lower reaches reflect that the streams are of low gradient and more sinuous. The river shows evidences of channel movement by avulsion, largely controlled by lineaments. Palaeo-levees, in the form 4 – 5 m high ridges exist along the Terna River floodplain, specifically in the Ter, Killari, Sastur, Dhuta and Makni villages. Several lineaments occur along NE-SW, NW-SE, E-W and WNW-ESE directions, which control the basement structure in the study area. The values of the Topographic Sinuosity Index (TSI) indicate rejuvenation of the area leading to the dominance of topography on the sinuosity of the river channels. The break in slope in the long profile is also indication of the Quaternary tectonic uplift of the area. Radiocarbon dating of some charcoal fragments <b>collected</b> from <b>folded</b> beddings indicates that paleoseismic activity might have taken place along the basin between AD 120 and AD 1671...|$|R

There was only one pile, though three little slips were laid suggestively by themselves.

40|$|Insecticide bioassays of the leafrollers, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), and Pandemis pyrusana Kearfott (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), {{were used}} to {{investigate}} resistance and cross-resistance between azinphosmethyl and other insecticides. Comparisons of field-collected populations with susceptible laboratory colonies of both leafroller species were made in 1996 – 97, prior to registration and field introduction of several of insecticides, and were re-tested in 2000 – 2001 following several years of use in the field. Insecticides tested included azinphosmethyl, chlorpyrifos, methyl parathion, tebufenozide, methoxyfenozide, spinosad, indoxacarb, acetamiprid, Bacillus thuringiensis, and azadirachtin. Azinphosmethyl-susceptible laboratory colonies were used for comparison to field populations. Resistance to azinphosmethyl was found in all populations of C. rosaceana (5. 2 – 26. 8 fold) and P. pyrusana (8. 4 – 24. 9 <b>fold)</b> <b>collected</b> from commercial orchards. Cross-resistance between azinphosmethyl and the insect growth regulators tebufenozide and methoxyfenozide was found {{in all but one}} population of the two leafroller species.

40|$|A {{sequence}} of volcaniclastic sedimentary and pyroclastic rocks of Permian age (late Leonardian or early Guadalupian; ≈ 260 Ma) in the Wallowa terrane of Oregon and Idaho has been sampled for paleomagnetic study. Forty-six sites (222 cores) were <b>collected</b> from <b>folded,</b> laminated siltstone, mudstone, and tuffaceous sandstone beds exposed along the Snake River in Hells Canyon. Several stratigraphic sections, within the 1500 - to 2500 -m-thick Hunsaker Creek Formation, were sampled over a stratigraphic interval of about 700 m. Thermal demagnetization revealed three components of magnetization. The A component {{has the lowest}} unblocking temperatures (generally less than about 200 °C), has normal polarity, and fails the fold test. The B component is removed between heating steps of about 200 °C and 550 °C, is of normal polarity, and also fails the fold test. The C component, observed between heating steps of approximately 550 °C and 660 °C, is always of negative inclination. The grouping of this component improves slightly upon unfolding, with the optimum grouping occurring at 95 % unfolding, using sites with n ≥ 3 and k ≥ 10, (k 95 /k 0 = 1. 18), or 100 % using sites n ≥ 3 (k 95 /k 0 = 1. 51). This component is interpreted as the characteristic remanent magnetization acquired during deposition of the Hunsaker Creek Formation based on the following observations: The better grouping of the high-temperature magnetic component after unfolding and the consistent reversed polarity seen in samples from the different sections. The resulting paleolatitude, calculated using inclination-only statistics, of 24 °± 12 ° N (n ≥ 3, k ≥ 10), or 26 °± 9 °N (n ≥ 3 sites), implies a northern hemisphere position of the Wallowa terrane during the Early Permian and possible southward transport of this terrane with respect to North America. If the Wallowa terrane {{was attached to the}} Wrangellia superterrane, our result indicates a northern hemisphere location for that superterrane during the Permian...|$|R
40|$|We have <b>collected</b> the kinetic <b>folding</b> {{data for}} non-two-state and two-state {{globular}} proteins {{reported in the}} literature, and investigated {{the relationships between the}} folding kinetics and the native three-dimensional structure of these proteins. The rate constants of formation of both the intermediate and the native state of non-two-state folders were found to be significantly correlated with protein chain length and native backbone topology, which is represented by the absolute contact order and sequence-distant native pairs. The folding rate of two-state folders, which is known to be correlated with the native backbone topology, apparently does not correlate significantly with protein chain length. On the basis of a comparison of the folding rates of the non-two-state and two-state folders, it was found that they are similarly dependent on the parameters that reflect the native backbone topology. This suggests that the mechanisms behind non-two-state and two-state folding are essentially identical. The present results lead us to propose a unified mechanism of protein folding, in which folding occurs in a hierarchical manner, reflecting the hierarchy of the native three-dimensional structure, as embodied in the case of non-two-state folding with an accumulation of the intermediate. Apparently, two-state folding is merely a simplified version of hierarchical folding caused either by an alteration in the rate-limiting step of folding or by destabilization of the intermediate...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial potential of ozone applied to 3 different solutions in an ultrasonic cleaning system against Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 120 mL of S. aureus were mixed in 6 L of the experimental solutions (sterilie distilled water, vinegar and sterile distilled water + Endozime AWpluz) used in a ultrasonic cleaning system (UCS). Ozone was produced by an electric discharge through a current of oxygen and bubbling with flow rate at 7 g/h ozone (1. 2 %) into the microbial suspensions. Ten mL of each experimental suspension were <b>collected</b> and 5 <b>fold</b> dilutions were made in 9 mL of BHI and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Bacterial growth was evaluated by turbidity of the culture medium. At the same time, 1 mL of bacterial samples was collected and inoculated in BHIA plates. After incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, the number of colony forming units (cfu) per mL on BHIA surface was counted. In dilution test in BHI tubes and in BHIA plates (cfu/mL), bacterial growth was not observed in any of the experimental solutions when ozone was added. Under the tested conditions, it may be concluded that the addition of ozone to a ultrasonic cleaning system containing different experimental solutions resulted in antibacterial activity against S. aureus.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{laboratory study}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the controls and differences between Klinkenbergcorrected gas and liquid permeability. For this reason outcrop core samples were <b>collected</b> from Kirthar <b>fold</b> belt of lower Indus basin, the plugs were horizontally taken, in cylindrical shape having dimension of 3. 5 - 5. 32 cm length and with maximum of 3. 2 cm diameter. The sample porosity measurements were performed using calculations from grain volume and bulk volume method. For the purpose of comparison, slippage free gas permeability tests using nitrogen gas was measured and liquid permeability of samples was measured using brine (NaCl) of different compositions. The data obtained showed that liquid permeability was lower by {{an order of magnitude}} than the permeability of samples measured with gas. However, the gas permeability corrected for Klinkenberg effects showed difference of half an order of magnitude when compared with liquid permeability. Hence the differences in liquid permeability and gas permeability could be described by other mechanism of particles mobilization and dissolution and pore blocking phenomena. Moreover, the obtained data of gas and liquid permeability was then used to develop permeability estimation correlations. The results suggests that there is scatter in the measured values and predicted values of gas and liquid permeability data, which means that such correlations should not be used where accurate liquid permeability values of tight sandstones are needed. Permeability predicted using the existing correlations developed based on gas permeability data lead to an overestimation of permeability also the flow rates might be over predicted within such low permeability reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|An {{updated version}} of the 3 D_ali {{databank}} (Pascarella and Argos, 1992) was constructed to incorporate new protein structural and sequence data acquired since the original release in 1992. The databank has proved useful in many research fields, such as protein sequence and structure analysis and comparison, protein folding, engineering and design, evolution, and the like. The collection enhances present protein structural knowledge by merging information from proteins having a similar main-chain fold with homologous primary structures taken from large databases of known sequences. However, the construction philosophy of the databank has been modified. Originally, the Protein Data Bank (PDB; Bernstein et al, 1977) of known 3 -D structures was exhaustively scanned for fold redundancy, and all the possible unique structures were incorporated either in multiple structural alignment files or in those containing only one structure where no relatives could be detected. The tertiary structural superpositioning of the backbones, which yielded spatial and topological Co atom equivalencing and thus corresponding sequence alignments, was mostly taken from the literature, but was sometimes determined by the authors using the Rossman-Argos superposition technique (Argos and Rossmann, 1979). In the updated 3 D_ali databank, only published alignments based on superpositioning by {{the authors of the}} tertiary structures were <b>collected</b> and only <b>folds</b> with more than one sample structure were considered. Different literature alignments were also merged if they included common folds. As in the former release, only full coordinate sets with assigned side chains were included, while NMR structures, excluded in the 1992 release, are now incorporated...|$|R
40|$|Folds with hinge lines subparallel to {{stretching}} lineation {{are common}} features in shear zones and represent extreme cases of fold modification. However, their microstructures {{and in particular}} their kinematic significance remain poorly understood. Here we describe the meso- and micro-scale structures and crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of quartz and muscovite from a metric-scale shear-modified fold from Plattjen, Saas Fee, Western Internal Alps. The studied fold is of class- 2 and the samples <b>collected</b> around the <b>fold</b> have essentially the same microstructures. Quartz [c]-axes plotted in the tectonic coordinate system exhibit an apparent reverse obliquity on opposing limbs. Muscovite fabrics are controlled essentially by the orientation of { 001 } planes. If the CPO data are plotted in a common reference frame (e. g. either fold or geographical), all samples exhibit essentially the same patterns for both minerals. In particular, relative to the fold axis and axial surface, the reversal of quartz CPO obliquity on opposing limbs is no longer evident. The small obliquity (~ 15 °) between the intersection lineation of the two planes of { 001 } of muscovite and the fold axis results in the apparent reversal of shear sense on opposite limbs when viewing the CPO related to the macroscopic fabric. The homogeneity of the microstructures and CPOs of quartz and muscovite across the fold support the interpretation that the fold developed during simultaneous activation of heterogeneous and homogeneous simple shear, with the former responsible for fold development and the latter responsible for fold rotation and the overwhelming of the heterogeneous deformation. These processes led to the observed parallelism between fold hinge line and local stretching lineation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The growing {{importance}} {{of use of}} Internet banking as another service delivery channel by banks to their customers lead {{to a number of}} supposition and deductions been made on the value creation of Internet banking and its extent of use. In the light of this, a profound and comprehensive study was conducted with the aim to first, determine the extent of use of Internet banking in Sweden, second, to validate the conjecture and the anecdote inferences that Internet banking provides values to both the bank and its customers. Design/Methodology/approach - To test the validity of the conjecture and the anecdote inferences made over the years, the author use data <b>collected</b> in two <b>folds.</b> One set was collected from financial institution “the big four banks” and the other set from 60 bank customers out of the 90 questionnaires administered. Findings - The results provide first, evidence of the high rate of adoption of Internet banking in Sweden, second, the values the banks and its customers have enjoyed since the advent of Internet banking. Research limitations/implications - Although this exploratory study approach may have validated the proposed model, further research into other cities is required to generalize these findings as this study has the limitation of using only Stockholm and the number of respondents used. Originality/value - The findings contribute and support several other studies that pointed to the fact that use of Internet banking channel of delivery is on the increase, and its value creation far exceed all other service delivery channels; provide critical implications for managers of financial institutions, Internet service providing firms, government and highlight directions for future research.
