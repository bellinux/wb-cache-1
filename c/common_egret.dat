Totally throughout the period, specific antibodies to the viruses were detected by neutralization test in wild birds (7. 3 %, WN; 8. 0 %, Geta; 0. 7 % Batai; 2. 8 %, Alpine hare (Lepus timidus); by hemagglutination-inhibition test in cattle (11. 4 % WN; 5. 9 %, JE; j 3. 0 %, TBE; 11. 6 %, Geta), horses (6. 1, 6. 8, 0, and 25. 3 %, respectively), and pigs (5. 4, 1. 5, 0, and 5. 9 %, respectively) by enzyme immunoassay (IgG) in human beings (0. 8, 0. 5, 6. 8, and 3. 2 %, respectively. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to reveal RNA of the NP segment of influenza A virus in 57. 9 and 65 % of the cloacal swabs from wild and domestic birds, respectively; and the HA-segment of subtype HH was not detected in 2005. HA/H 5 RNA was recorded in 5. 5 and 6. 7 % of the swabs from wild and domestic birds, respectively; 6 % of the specimens from domestic birds were M-segment positive in 2006. RNA of influenza A virus NA/H 7 and RNA was not detected throughout the years. In 2004, the cloacal swabs 8 isolated influenza A strains: two H 3 N 8 and two H 4 N 8 strains from European teals (Anas crecca), two (H 3 N 8 and H 6 N 2) strains from Baikal teals (A. formosa), one (H 10 N 4) strain from shovelers (A. clypeata), and one (H 4 N 8) from garganeys (A. querquedula). In 2004, one ND virus strain was isolated from the cloacal swabs from European teals (A. crecca). RT-PCR revealed RNA of this virus in some 8 more cloacal swabs from black ducks (A. poecilorhyncha) (3 positive specimens), pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) (n = 2), garganeys (A. querquedula) (n = 1), gadwalls (A. strepera) (n = 1), and geese (Anser anser domesticus) (n = 1).
