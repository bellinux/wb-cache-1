40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{the potential of}} applying surface enzymatic treatments on <b>finished</b> <b>paper</b> sheets to improve their physical characteristics. Research studies have recently reported that is possible to internally size paper using enzymatic treatments, applied in mass. In the present work an innovative method for achieving enzymatic surface sizing on <b>finished</b> <b>paper</b> sheets is presented. A commercial filter paper and handmade eucalyptus sheets were surface sized with laccase derived from Trametes Villosa, Lauryl Gallate (LG) as hydrophobic compound, and soluble lignin. Moreover, this study shows the positive influence of sulfonated lignin since it acts as a dispersant, improving the homogeneous distribution of the LG along the paper sheet.

40|$|The present work {{describes}} a new method for the surface functionalization of cellulosic sheets, overcoming {{the limitations of}} the traditional treatments, which are usually performed using fibrous suspensions. The method consists in obtaining a product (post-enzymatic) derived from an enzymatic reaction using Laccase and a compound showing a specific property. The obtained product, which has aqueous consistency, is then applied to the surface of a <b>finished</b> <b>paper</b> sheet (or cellulosic substrate) by means of impregnation, spray, size-press, or other available surface deposition technique used in the industry. The functionalization is produced by means of physicochemical interaction between the product and the substrate. In the present research, the methodology is developed to achieve the hydrophobization of <b>finished</b> <b>paper</b> sheets using Lauryl Gallate (LG) as hydrophobic compound, and a laccase derived from Trametes Villosa, reaching absorption times of up to 4000 s and CA values around 130 ° as assessed by the water drop test (WDT) and contact angle measurements (CA) respectivelyPostprint (published version...|$|R

50|$|Ingres {{paper is}} a type of drawing paper.

Ingres is not {{necessarily}} a handmade paper, but is produced to replicate the properties of laid paper. Ingres is often used for charcoal and pastel drawing. It is also used as an endpaper in books.|$|R

40|$|During {{the drying}} {{stage of the}} {{papermaking}} process, paper undergoes dimensional changes caused by fiber dehydration, but exhibiting uneven width reduction magnitudes along the cross-machine direction. The degree of cross-direction (CD) shrinkage can be very different at the edges {{when compared to the}} center of the web. The highest shrinkage amplitude at the web edges can vary according to the operation conditions and the drying section configuration, as well. The difference in the degree of CD shrinkage gives rise to adverse effects on the <b>finished</b> CD <b>paper</b> sheet properties, particularly strength and hygroelastic properties, which can vary many percents from the edges {{to the center of the}} web. Extreme property values lead to different problems, such as sheet differential dimensional instability, which can limit paper quality and converting efficiency, especially in high speed machines (e. g., multi-color offset printing and office copier machines). The issues considered above make clear the advantages of measuring and carefully analyzing the differential CD shrinkage profile of <b>finished</b> <b>paper.</b> This work reviews the CD differential shrinkage profile development in the drying section, its impact on <b>finished</b> <b>paper</b> properties and presents an accurate and low cost measurement method based on image analysis techniques, supported by digital processing through the two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (2 D-FFT). The experimental results show that image analysis applied to paper samples taken from the jumbo roll represents a reliable method for determining the differential CD shrinkage profile, and a practical tool for monitoring paper quality and evaluating its CD dimensional stability profile...|$|R

50|$|To produce prints, {{the plate}} is {{dampened}} with a glycerine/water mixture which is slightly acidic, then blotted before inking with collotype ink using a leather or velvet roller.
