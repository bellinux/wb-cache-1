40|$|Fact sheet {{written for}} the Inventions and Innovation Program about a new method for making steel {{strapping}} and strip from rod stock produced from scrap steel. There is a large movement in the American steel industry to utilize more recycled steel. Recycled steel melted in the electric arc furnaces of mini-mills is being used {{as the source of}} raw materials for an increasing number of products, largely due to its lower price. However, conventional processes for producing steel strapping and <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> steel restrict manufacturers from using more than 50 % recycled steel. In addition, steel strapping and <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> steel traditionally require many production steps. They are produced from primary steel that has been cast into slab, heated, rolled to achieve the desired thickness, and slit to the desired width. The slitting process produces microcracks {{along the edge of the}} strapping or strip, which reduce tensile strength. A new continuous process produces steel strapping and 1 / 2 inch to 6 inch strip steel from the rod and strip stock made from scrap steel in mini-mills. The new process creates steel strapping and strip with improved strength and quality due to the absence of microcracks caused by the conventional slitting process. The finished product is cheaper because of the lower cost associated with using rod ad lower conversion costs. In addition, the higher tensile strength of the product allows for thinner strapping. The process represents a new approach to producing any steel strapping used for bundling and packaging items for storage or transport. In addition, this innovative new process can be used to produce <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> steel, a basic raw material for automobile parts, hardware, office equipment, and many other products...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} {{mechanism of}} the <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> shape with high tension was studied. An advanced method to calculate the allowable variation of strip transverse profiles was established by the strip buckling criterion, which can be more properly used in cold rolling. With this method, the aim allowable variation of the product strip transverse profile and the required transverse profile range of incoming strips can be reached. Besides, this method has been successfully applied in a domestic tandem cold mill, and the transverse profile range of incoming strips suggested with this method is more practicable and complete. Consequently, the good performance is acquired...|$|E
30|$|Peng and Zhang [77] {{proposed}} a back propagation (BP) algorithm based on modified error function {{to overcome a}} major problem of long training time of the BP algorithm and chance of falling into local minima. It was noted that the delay of the convergence {{was caused by the}} derivative of the activation function. A slightly modified error function of the back propagation algorithm resolved this shortcoming and accelerated convergence to a solution. For five typical defects from <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> samples, improved algorithm was effective at getting rid of local minima problem with less time (30 epochs as against 100) with an average success rate of about 94 %.|$|E
30|$|Yunhui et al. [82]: To {{study the}} problem of {{achieving}} classification accuracy {{at the cost of}} complexity of algorithm, a cascaded weak classifier composed of several weak classifiers (based on extended Haar rectangle features) has been compared with KNN, NN-BP and SVM for <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strips.</b> With each weak classifier filtering out the most negative samples, a large number of negative samples are eliminated after T-classifiers by a small amount of computation. Superiority of weak classifier (best overall result 94 %) is documented for six types of defects in cold strips.|$|R
30|$|Traditionally, Hough {{transform}} [3, 43] is {{very successful}} in demarcating well-defined shapes. Martins et al. [43] used Hough transform to detect three geometrically well-defined shapes: welding, clamp and identification hole in <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strips.</b> After homographic filtering to remove illumination variation, Gaussian and morphological filters were applied to reduce noise. Segmentation was realised by applying edge detection method and thresholding. Hough transform {{was performed on the}} binary image for line and circle detection. Three types of defects- welding (diagonal line), clamp (multiple lines in down-web direction) and identification hole (circle with fixed radius {{in the middle of the}} strip)- were identified.|$|R
30|$|This is {{particularly}} true when occurrence of pseudo defects is very limited as can be observed for many hot- and <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strips.</b> In such cases, detection itself serves a very useful purpose of identifying a particular product as defective in a continuous production line. Appropriate action of segregating the defective product follows naturally. However, without defect classification, corrective actions cannot be taken to stop occurrence of defects in future. Defect detection loses its significances without classification in situations where pseudo defect percentage is significant and/or variable. This is mostly the case with slab, billet and rod/bar. Here, vision-based inspection systems are useful only when features are extracted from RoIs, and classification is achieved between defects and pseudo defects and then between the defects themselves.|$|R
30|$|Images {{of steel}} {{surfaces}} contain {{a lot of}} noise, and pre-processing in most papers is devoted to noise reduction and highlighting defective region from background. Noise removal is more important in slab/billet/rod surfaces where visual characteristics of defects (crack, seam) are {{similar to that of}} pseudo defects (scale etc.). Averaging filter [58, 61] and Gaussian filter [59] are used routinely before processing for defect detection. Interestingly, a Wiener filter, which requires processing in frequency domain with information on power spectrum of noise and un-degraded image, has been used in a <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> application [76] with real-time suitability. [25, 43] used homographic filtering to reduce effect of variable illumination.|$|E
30|$|Steel {{surfaces}} exhibit {{many types}} of defects, and NN-BP has been extensively used to classify such defects [31, 36, 54, 59, 63, 72, 78, 80]. Generally, NN-BP has been used with one hidden layer. Large variation of number of nodes used in input layer (feature space: 4 to more than 50), hidden layer (10 to 100) and output layer (defect class: 2 to 24) has been reported. Most of the applications of NN-BP {{have been found to}} be for hot- and <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> surfaces presumably because of manifestation of large number of important defect classes. Performance of NN-BP has been compared with other classifiers in [31, 36], and NN-BP has been found to be performing better.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Although edge-wave and centre-buckles in {{rolled strip}} are {{believed}} to be largely self-equilibrated, the result of residual stress, formation of herringbone and quarter-buckles in hot- or <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> is believed to require application of external stress. It is verified here that stress distributions such as those indicated by Roberts are possible causes of quar-ter-buckling and herringbone buckling. Quarter-buckling is believed to result from stress in the sheet or strip produced by non-parabolic bending of the work rolls. Herringbone buckling is attributed to local regions of axial tension and compression in the transverse stress distribution, caused by misalignment, which effectively produces a shear in the sheet that may manifest itself in diagonal buckling...|$|E

In [63], pre-processing for background noise removal consists of temporal discrete Fourier transform (DFT), high pass filter and inverse DFT. Thereafter, multifractal based on morphology has been used to identify defective segments. Ten features have been used for classification using three-layer NN-BP. Ninety-eight percent accuracy in classification has been achieved. In [31], background image has been obtained using median value of pixels of a set of randomly selected images. To identify defect in difference images, the local entropy of the pixels is calculated using 9 [*]×[*] 9 matrix and an adaptive threshold. Thereafter, morphological erosion, thresholding and dilation identify defect areas. With nine features, feed-forward neural network is used for classification with accuracy of 97 %.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of {{transverse}} thickness difference and width-to-thickness ratio on the critical unstable shape of <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> is studied computationally and experimentally. Firstly, the influence model under actual working conditions is developed by referring to the basic relationship between transverse thickness difference and shape under ideal conditions. After that, the combined influence of transverse thickness difference and width-to-thickness ratio on the critical unstable shape is analyzed based on the elastic sheet stability model. Experimental validations demonstrate that during the production of ultrathin strip steel with different width-to-thickness ratios, the loading roller shapes should be fine adjusted according to the transverse thickness difference of input strips. Therefore, the variation of transverse thickness difference of output strips can meet the requirement of shape stability, so as to obtain fine shape...|$|E

In [31], enhanced quality of <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> image was first obtained after subtracting generated background image. Local entropy of each pixel was calculated using a 9 × 9 matrix and then thresholding done on the resultant image by Otsu's method. In order to eliminate nonrelated regions, morphological dilation and erosion operations were done on binary image. As against entropy which is a measure of randomness, excess entropy {{is a measure of the}} structure of the system and was introduced in [25] as the measure of image's spatial structure.

Using weight-loss method {{combined}} with metallographic to analysis {{the effect of}} annealing temperature (600 ℃, 640 ℃, 680 ℃) on the corrosion resistance of cold rolled strip of complex brass HAl 72 - 2. 5 Al- 1. 0 Ni alloy. Corrosive solutions for testing the corrosion velocity were 3. 5 % of the neutral sodium chloride solution, artificial acid rain (3. 5 % NaCl+H 2 SO 4 solution) and artificial sweat solution. The research {{results show that the}} corrosion of cold rolled strip occurs easily because grains stretched along the direction of deformation and the existence of residual stress. The maximum corrosion depth of <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> is 94. 8 µm. Annealing treatment can effectively reduce the corrosion depth of alloy. Corrosion resistance of alloy rises with the increase of annealing temperature, because the recrystallization degree of alloy goes on more sufficient. The corrosion depth of samples annealed at 600 ℃ and 680 ℃ drops from 64. 45 µm to 56. 32 µm respectively. Aluminum content in the alloy also affects the corrosion resistance of the alloy, because oxygen oxidizes aluminum to density Al 2 O 3 film which prevents the further corrosion of the alloy. The corrosion velocity of samples in the solution of artificial acid rain is fastest and lowest in artificial perspiration solution...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} was aimed {{to investigate the}} mechanism of Ni 3 Al phase precipitation during long-term process of ageing Cu-Ni-Al. type alloys with particular account of the precipitates morphology changes, including the changes in their size with varying temperature and ageing time, so as to determine an effect of the elastic strain energy on these changes. Design/methodology/approach: Samples of <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>strips</b> from the CuNi 16 Al 5 alloy were solution – treated at 900 °C for 1 h in argon atmosphere, water quenched and next aged at the temperatures of 450 and 550 °C for up to 380 and 760 hours, respectively. Their microstructure was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Findings: It was found that decomposition of supersaturated solid solution proceeds by nucleation and growth of the coherent precipitates of the L 12 –Ni 3 Al phase. Their morphology changes {{as a result of}} competitive influence of an elastic strain energy, surface energy on the matrix-precipitate inter-phase boundary, and the energy of elastic interaction between precipitates. The L 12 –Ni 3 Al precipitates nucleate as the spherical ones and grow, forming intermediate sub-structures, until they reach a cubic form with the planes parallel to the{ 100 } planes of a matrix and take privileged positions along the directions. Clear deviations from the LSW coagulation theory and its modifications, demonstrated by the slow-down of the process, have been observed. In the extreme case, growth of the precipitates can be completely stopped in some time ranges of the ageing process. Research limitations/implications: Further research should be concentrated on the precipitation kinetics within a wider range of volumetric fraction of the Ni 3 Al phase in a copper matrix. Practical implications: This effect can be used in practice to stabilise mechanical properties at elevated temperature.

50|$|<b>Cold-rolled</b> {{sheets and}} <b>strips</b> come in various conditions: full-hard, half-hard, quarter-hard, and skin-rolled. Full-hard rolling reduces the {{thickness}} by 50%, {{while the others}} involve less of a reduction. Skin-rolling, {{also known as a}} skin-pass, involves the least amount of reduction: 0.5-1%. It is used to produce a smooth surface, a uniform thickness, and reduce the yield point phenomenon (by preventing Lüders bands from forming in later processing). It locks dislocations at the surface and thereby reduces the possibility of formation of Lüders bands. To avoid the formation of Lüders bands it is necessary to create substantial density of unpinned dislocations in ferrite matrix. It is also used to break up the spangles in galvanized steel. Skin-rolled stock is usually used in subsequent cold-working processes where good ductility is required.|$|R

40|$|A novel method {{based on}} {{three-dimensional}} profilometry data and Matlab analysis software is described to identify surface features on <b>cold-rolled</b> stainless steel <b>strip.</b> The {{aim of the}} method is to detect automatically pits and roll marks that {{can be observed in}} optical or SEM micrographs. Pits are identified by locating regions which are significantly deeper than the immediately adjacent surface. Deep or steep features which extend a significant distance in the direction of rolling are identified as roll marks. Results for typical cold-rolled stainless steel sheet show that the algorithms are effective in identifying the more obvious pits and roll marks. By suitable adjustment of the tolerances used in the analysis, the method can be tailored to detect less severe features. Application of the method, either for research purposes or routine industrial inspection, will require tuning of these tolerances to detect pits of the severity relevant to the end use of the strip. The methodology has been applied to a series of rolled strip samples to track the evolution of pits and roll marks during a schedule. Results show how the initially large area of deep pits is rapidly eliminated and transformed into shallow pits. The pit identification method is used to estimate the effect of trapped oil on lubrication. Results suggest that this expelled oil will contribute significantly to the lubrication of the surrounding area.

Tensile coupons {{in the flat}} portions and corners of each section were tested. Hence, the Youngs moduli, 0. 2 % proof stresses, 1. 0 % proof stresses, tensile strengths, elongation at fracture and the RambergOsgood parameter (n) of lean duplex material for each section were measured. The material properties of the complete cross-sections in the cold-worked state were also obtained from stub column tests. The initial local geometric imperfections of the six sections were measured, and the profiles of the local imperfections along cross-section were plotted for each section. Residual stresses were measured for section 150 × 50 × 2. 5 using the method of sectioning. The membrane and bending residual stress distributions in the cross-section were obtained and plotted. Furthermore, finite element model of stub columns was developed and compared well with the test results.

The test specimens were <b>cold-rolled</b> from flat <b>strips</b> of lean duplex stainless steel (EN 1. 4162). Initial overall geometric imperfections of the column specimens were measured prior to testing. The column specimens were concentrically loaded between pinned ends. The ultimate loads and the failure modes of each column are presented. The test strengths of the specimens were compared with the design strengths predicted by the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European Code for stainless steel structures. Generally, the specifications are able to predict {{the strengths of the}} tested columns. The European Code provides the most conservative predictions, while the American Specification provides conservative predictions when the design strengths calculated using the material properties from tensile coupon tests. The design approach of using full cross-section area and material properties obtained by stub column tests for all classes of sections including slender sections was recommended.
