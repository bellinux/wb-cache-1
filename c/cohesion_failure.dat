40|$|In fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{strengthened}} steel structures, debonding of the bonded FRP reinforcement {{from the}} steel substrate {{may result from}} adhesion failure at the steel/adhesive interface or the FRP/adhesive interface, <b>cohesion</b> <b>failure</b> in the adhesive, {{or a combination of}} these two modes. Of these failure modes, <b>cohesion</b> <b>failure</b> in the adhesive is the preferred mode of failure as it facilitates the development of a design theory based on the adhesive properties; the other two failure modes should be avoided if at all possible. This paper presents a systematic experimental study to identify a surface-adhesive combination that will avoid adhesion failure at the steel/adhesive interface. Different steel surface preparation methods, including solvent cleaning, hand grinding, and grit blasting, and different commonly used adhesives were examined in the study. Surface characterization using three key parameters (namely surface energy, surface chemical composition, and surface roughness and topography) was investigated. The test results showed that adhesion failure at the steel/adhesive interface can be avoided if the steel surface is properly grit blasted before bonding and a suitable adhesive is used, and that the treated surface can be characterized using the three key surface parameters mentioned previously.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to deposit an {{adherent}} apatite coating on titanium substrate using a two-step chemical deposition method. First, titanium substrates were immersed in an acidic solution containing calcium and phosphate ions, resulting in the deposition of a monetite (CaHPO 4) coating. Second, the monetite crystals were converted to apatite by hydrolysis in NaOH solution. Composition and morphology of the initial and final coatings were identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The final coating was porous and the apatite crystals were agglomerated and followed the outline of the large monetite crystals. The average tensile bond of the coating was 5. 2 MPa and <b>cohesion</b> <b>failures</b> were observed more frequently than adhesion failures. The coating adhesion measured using scratch test was 13. 1 N. In conclusion, this study showed the potential of a two-step chemical deposition method for depositing an adherent coating of apatite at low temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Moisture {{sensitivity}} of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) mixtures, generally called stripping, {{is a major}} form of distress in asphalt concrete pavement. It {{is characterized by the}} loss of adhesive bond between the asphalt binder and the aggregate (a failure of the bonding of the binder to the aggregate) or by a softening of the cohesive bonds within the asphalt binder (a failure within the binder itself), both of which are due to the action of loading under traffic in the presence of moisture. The evaluation of HMA moisture sensitivity has been divided into two categories: visual inspection test and mechanical test. However, most of them have been developed in pre-Superpave mix design. This research was undertaken to develop a protocol for evaluating the moisture sensitivity potential of HMA mixtures using the Nottingham Asphalt Tester (NAT). The mechanisms of HMA moisture sensitivity were reviewed and the test protocols using the NAT were developed. Different types of blends as moisture-sensitive groups and non-moisture-sensitive groups were used to evaluate the potential of the proposed test. The test results were analyzed with three parameters based on performance character: the retained flow number depending on critical permanent deformation failure (RFNP), the retained flow number depending on <b>cohesion</b> <b>failure</b> (RFNC), and energy ratio (ER). Analysis based on energy ratio of elastic strain (EREE) at flow number of <b>cohesion</b> <b>failure</b> (FNC) has higher potential to evaluate the HMA moisture sensitivity than other parameters.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} roles of food in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. The methodology used is a modified systematic literature review. This study examines how food becomes involved {{in the development of}} both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Empathic failures in the early care-giving environment result in many developmental arrests, including a lack of self regulatory skills, inability to symbolise, and more importantly deficits in self cohesion. In the absence of symbolisation, the eating disordered patient perceives food, the first bridge between a mother and her child, as a representation of the mother together with her love and care. The relationship between the patient suffering from anorexia nervosa and her mother is usually described as engulfing, leaving no room for the daughter to separate and individuate. The patient’s refusal of food is, in essence, a way of establishing a sense of self, an attempt to separate from the mother in order to survive psychically. For the patient suffering from bulimia nervosa, her mother is often described as passive and rejecting. The mother of the bulimic patient is not necessarily cold, but the care-giving relationship often lacks warmth and nurturing elements. From the self psychology perspective, inadequate self cohesion means the patient constantly relies on food or disordered eating to provide the selfobject functions necessary for the maintenance of self <b>cohesion.</b> The <b>failure</b> to get her selfobject needs met by human beings during the early development also reinforces her dependence on the use of food, a reliable and controllable selfobject. Treatment implications are discussed and recommendations for future research are explained...|$|R

Since {{samples from the}} Boso accretionary prism did not mesoscopically fracture in the experiments, the effective shear parameters were only determined for those Shimanto Belt samples that showed clear evidence for shear <b>failure.</b> <b>Cohesion</b> values determined using this method are slightly higher (between 18.6 and 42.3  MPa) than the values determined by Mohr Circle constructions or stress path diagrams, except for sample Sch 2011 / 23, which has a lower cohesion of 12.8  MPa. Angles of internal friction are generally lower (between 21.8 ° and 43.6 °) except for sample Sch 2011 / 23, which has a higher {{angle of internal friction}} compared to the other methods (Table  4). Sample Sch 2011 / 29 has a very low angle of internal friction of 9 °.

40|$|In 2003 the MnDOT {{concrete}} {{engineering unit}} maintained an approved product list {{that included a}} variety of joint sealants. Performance {{of some of the}} sealants was not very salutary. This necessitated an abrogation of the approved list of joint sealants, whereupon, many manufacturers were informed about a process which seemed feasible to use at that time for readmission into the list. This was the NTPEP program that was looking into the performance of joint sealants. In consequence an unbonded overlay project on US Highway 10 between Motley and Staples, Minnesota was chosen as a test site. The contractor was to provide typical unsealed joints while the various sealant manufacturers were to provide all their prescribed joints and seal them. The NTPEP program provided a protocol for evaluation of the joints and a scoring criterion primarily for the condition of the sealers. The NTPEP monitoring was done for 7 years but at this stage the condition of the joints was reported as merely the performance of the joint sealers, evident in adhesion failure, <b>cohesion</b> <b>failure</b> or lack of these.

50|$|This Is the Police is a {{real-time}} management {{video game}} where the player controls protagonist Jack Boyd, a police chief in the game's location of Freeburg set {{to retire in}} one hundred and eighty days. The gameplay is presented via imagery and text on an isometric map. The player is tasked to make $500,000 in his final six months on the force, through various ways which the player chooses; one of the options include utilizing the local mafia. The mafia may ask the player to {{turn a blind eye}} towards some of the crimes and be rewarded with money, or if they wish to stay alive. The player receives calls and they are tasked to prioritize certain ones while dealing with staffing. Depending of the severity of the calls, the amount of police sent varies. If it's a case of assault, only two police need to go, but if it's an armed robbery, ten may need to go. As the game progresses, the player is able to send SWAT Teams and reinforcements. The player must strategize about how many officers they sent to each crime, because if there are no spare officers, some crimes cannot be stopped. Failure to stop crimes results in the player's squad and pay being reduced. Later on during the game, the department's officers will start taking sides between the two main political figures, Mayor Rogers and Robespierre. The political views of the player's officers are unknown unless they make one of them a rat, which increases the likelihood of mistrust and the death of the officer while docking some of your pay in order to recompense that officer for his information. Sending out squads of officers with differing political opinions degrades unit <b>cohesion,</b> causing more <b>failures</b> unless groups of officers with similar morals and values are sent {{to the scene of the}} crime.

The parts were made by an additive manufacturing process termed as Composite Metal Foil Manufacturing. It is a combination of Laminated Object Manufacturing and brazing. The effectiveness of the process is validated with lap shear testing, peel testing, microstructural analysis and tensile testing.

40|$|CTF 4 and CTF 18 are {{required}} for high-fidelity chromosome segregation. Both exhibit genetic and physical ties to replication fork constituents. We find that absence of either CTF 4 or CTF 18 causes sister chromatid <b>cohesion</b> <b>failure</b> and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells {{that depends on the}} spindle assembly checkpoint. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF 4, CTF 18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. We find that Ctf 18 p, an RFC 1 -like protein, directly interacts with Rfc 2 p, Rfc 3 p, Rfc 4 p, and Rfc 5 p. However, Ctf 18 p is not a component of biochemically purified proliferating cell nuclear antigen loading RF-C, suggesting the presence of a discrete complex containing Ctf 18 p, Rfc 2 p, Rfc 3 p, Rfc 4 p, and Rfc 5 p. Recent identification and characterization of the budding yeast polymerase κ, encoded by TRF 4, strongly supports a hypothesis that the DNA replication machinery is required for proper sister chromatid cohesion. Analogous to the polymerase switching role of the bacterial and human RF-C complexes, we propose that budding yeast RF-CCTF 18 may be involved in a polymerase switch event that facilities sister chromatid cohesion.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the development of an accurate bond strength model for carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips near-surface mounted (NSM) to concrete where debonding occurs as a result of <b>cohesion</b> <b>failure</b> in the adjacent concrete. Based on an existing analytical solution and the fracture energy equation recently developed by the authors, a bond strength equation is first proposed for NSM CFRP strip-to-concrete bonded joints with a sufficient bond length (i. e., the bond length exceeds a threshold value referred to as the effective bond length). The influence of an insufficient bond length on the bond strength is next examined through a parametric study conducted using a beam-spring numerical model in which a bond-slip model recently proposed by the authors is incorporated. Based on the numerical results, expressions are formulated for the effective bond length and the bond-strength reduction factor for insufficient bond lengths. The combination of these equations leads to a new bond strength model for NSM CFRP strip-to-concrete bonded joints. The predictions of the proposed bond strength model are compared with the results of 51 test specimens collected from seven existing studies and the predictions of the only existing bond strength model for such joints. These comparisons indicate that the proposed model is accurate and superior to the existing bond strength model, particularly for joints with insufficient bond lengths. The proposed bond strength model, because of its accuracy and simplicity, can be readily incorporated in design codes and guidelines. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E

The failure modes of slide-debris flows may be classified into translational slides and rotational slides, and the former are predominant.

Undisturbed soil samples from south Lantau have been subjected to anisotropically consolidated undrained compression tests at comparatively low stress levels. Constant deviatoric stress path tests (CQD) simulating the stress path in the field at in situ stress levels have been performed to investigate soil behavior. The CQD test results indicate that the material of slopes at undisturbed state is brought to dilation because of the increase in pore water pressure caused by infiltration of rain water. For a translational slide, the displacement, resulting from dilation, may destroy <b>cohesion</b> along the <b>failure</b> surface and locally within the interior of the slide. The surplus water during the intense rainstorm was able to equilibrate the reduction in pore pressure caused by dilation, and the dilation and displacement may be further increased. The strain-softening after significant strains triggered debris flow mobilization. However, for a rotational slide, the increase in pore water pressure caused by surplus water infiltration during the intense rainstorm could not equilibrate the reduction in pore pressure caused by dilation, much or even all of the sliding block could not mobilize into a debris flow. | Lantau Island experienced a severe rainstorm on November 4 - 5, 1993, inducing > 800 slope failures in natural terrain.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{accounts}} of slope failures on blanket bogs, but their nature and controls are poorly understood. This study investigates {{the mechanisms of}} blanket bog failure on Cuilcagh Mountain, north-west Ireland, and identifies the critical factors affecting the stability of peatland hillslopes. This is achieved by means of extensive field investigations involving hydrological monitoring, soil sampling and comprehensive laboratory analyses to determine the physical, hydrological and geotechnical properties of the blanket peat. The results from these investigations {{form the basis of}} hillslope hydrology and slope stability modelling using finite-element modelling programmes (commercial SEEP/W and SLOPE/W software). A total of 47 failures scars were identified on Cuilcagh Mountain involving an estimated 300, 000 m 3 of peat. Detailed field investigations revealed two main types of peatland slope failure: shallow translational peat slides associated with the failure of clay underlying the blanket peat, and bog flows in which failure occurs as a slurrytype plastic flow with the failure zone located within the peat. Peat slides were more prevalent on the steeper slopes (7. 0 - 17. 00) of Cuilcagh, whereas bog flows were found exclusively on low gradient slopes (1. 5 - 7. 50) with deep accumulations of peat (typically up to 2. 5 m). Previously it had been suggested that bog failures were confined to steep slopes or peripheral areas of blanket bogs. However, on Cuilcagh Mountain they appear to {{be an integral part of}} the natural evolution of the main peatland, with the presence of many failure scars at different stages ofre-vegetation and recovery. Conventional methods of slope stability analysis (Factor of Safety using limit equilibrium methods) were found to be adequate for use on peat slide failures, but were not as suitable for analysing the slopes prone to bog flows. Sensitivity analyses indicate that <b>cohesion</b> of the <b>failure</b> material (Le. the catotelm peat for bog flows and the underlying clay for peat slides) is the most critical factor contributing to slope failure. A reduction in cohesion is thought to be related to decomposition andlor progressive failure of the peat, or weathering and creep of the underlying clay. Increased overburden pressure from continuing peat accumulation is also an important factor in reducing the overall stability of a peatland slope. The initiation of bog flows and peat slides can occur from the progressive failure of the material in question, but there is more evidence to suggest that both types of failure are more frequently initiated as a result of a specific trigger event usually associated with high intensity rainfall...|$|R
40|$|Seven bedrock {{landslides}} situated within quartzofeldspathic schist exist {{up slope}} of the residential area along the Frankton Arm of Lake Wakatipu, South Island, New Zealand. Engineering geological and geotechnical failure models for these landslides have been established using engineering geological mapping at scales of 1 : 5000 and 1 : 10000, geotechnical testing, {{and the development of}} limit-equilibriurn sensitivity models. Geotechnical testing of artificially fractured schist bedrock obtained shear strength values of Φ = 24 °- 36 ° and zero cohesion, and point load strength indexes of 0. 6 - 3. 83 MPa for rock tested perpendicular to foliation, and 0. 11 - 0. 92 for rock tested parallel to foliation. Testing of shear zone material gave values of Φ 60 °- 110 ° and zero <b>cohesion.</b> The largest <b>failure</b> is the Queenstown Hill Landslide, with an estimated volume of 240 M m³ which is interpreted as a retrogressive translational landslide with the toe forming a compressional bulge in the mid-slope area of Queenstown Hill. Three phases of movement have taken place, the earliest phase probably being initiated in the southeastern area of the slide mass by ice scouring and the over steepening of slopes during the final stages of the Last Glaciation. On retreat of the glacial ice, lateral support was removed and increased pore water pressures may have acted to reduce the shear strength of the slope along critical failure or shear surfaces. Movement is inferred to have been by translational planar sliding by slow rock mass creep, not from buckling in the toe, partly along foliation shear zones and a stepped failure surface in fractured schist bedrock immediately following glacial retreat. The second and third phases of movement were initiated {{as a result of the}} removal of support by the previous phase, with the second phase forming small translational- slides and. retrogressive features, and the third phase forming the toe bulging by gravitational creep down slope. Six smaller bedrock failures (up to 2. 8 M m³ each in volume) are situated further east along Frankton Arm. These landslides are interpreted as shallow retrogressive translational failures, with their slide bases orientated sub-parallel to the schist foliation. These failures may have initially occurred following glacial retreat (similar to the Queenstown Hill Landslide), with the slides situated at lower elevations activated by seismic events at a much later stage following deposition of lake beaches as the enlarged Lake Wakatipu was lowering. The only evidence for continual movement for within the last 100 years is on Slide No. 3 and Slide No. 4. Minor wedge failures have occurred from the head scarp, but the high frictional interlock between the displaced blocks creates minimal risk to the residential areas below and if further development was to occur in these areas, prudent engineering geological practices should be implemented.

As an elected official for over seventeen years, including service as a Member of Parliament, I have travelled {{to many of the}} regions reviewed in this study. I have heard firsthand accounts from witnesses of the consequences of state failure in countries including Afghanistan, Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti. Failing states have overlapping characteristics of structural competency failure, including the inability to provide healthcare, education, food, legitimate policing and economic sustainability. There are economic inequalities present as well as a loss of legitimacy, corruption and reduced social <b>cohesion.</b> <b>Failure</b> of rule of law is manifested in areas of judicial adjudication, security, reduced territorial control and systemic political instability. The international community often confronts these challenges in a manner that actually complicates issues further through lack of consensus among actors. Consequently, a new and emerging concept of sovereignty needs to be reviewed in terms of the post-modern state. The new and emerging human security compact, evolving globalization and the decline of the state redefine it within the new global order. In some instances the best interests of these failing and failed states would be best served by shared sovereignty with the international community; that is, trusteeship. International actors attempting to 2 ̆ 7 fix 2 ̆ 7 failed states must focus their attention on the issues affecting structural competency that have actually caused the state to fail in the first place. By addressing the structural competency of failed states with an understanding of the causes, it is possible to create the practical framework for a global model of statehood that prevents state failure. Effective policies of integrated state-building and resources targeted at bridging structural competency gaps require a better understanding of both the challenges and the solutions...|$|E
40|$|Ricinoloxazoline maleinate (OXA) was grafted by melt {{free radical}} {{grafting}} onto polyolefins and elastomers to produce new compatibilizers for polymer blends. Effects of initial monomer and peroxide concentrations {{on the degree}} of grafting, on the amount of residual monomer, and on the side reactions were investigated. Reactive compatibilizers could be prepared with a suitable choice of processing conditions and initial concentrations. These oxazoline functionalized polyolefins and elastomers were found to act as effective compatibilizers in polymer blends. Blends of polyolefins and polyamide 6 were compatibilized with two novel types of compatibilizers: oxazoline functionalized polymers prepared by grafting and functionalized polyolefins prepared by copolymerization using metallocene catalysts. Comparison was made with commercial compatibilizers. Effects of the compatibilizers on blend morphology and thermal, tensile, and impact properties were studied. All of the functionalized polyolefins were effective compatibilizers in polyethylene/polyamide 6 blends. They were able to reduce the particle size and attach the particles more firmly to the matrix. The toughness was improved, though usually at the cost of stiffness. Only functionalized polyethylenes prepared with metallocene catalysts were able to improve the stiffness and strength along with toughness. In commercial polyolefin composites, fillers are usually coated with a fatty acid to make them organophilic. Replacement of fatty acid coatings with polymeric compatibilizers was studied in polyethylene/aluminum hydroxide (PE/ATH) and polyethylene/magnesium hydroxide (PE/MH) composites. The polymeric compatibilizers were oxazoline grafted polyethylene prepared by melt free radical grafting, hydroxyl and carboxylic acid functionalized polyethylenes prepared with metallocene catalysts, and commercial functionalized polyethylenes. Adhesion fracture changed to <b>cohesion</b> <b>failure</b> when the fatty acid coating was replaced through the addition of polymeric compatibilizers. Improvement in both stiffness and toughness was achieved, and improvements in flammability properties achieved with ATH or MH were preserved when polymeric compatibilizers were used as adhesion promoters. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Roof {{falls and}} {{accumulation}} of dangerous gasses {{are the most}} common hazards in any underground coal mine. Different mechanisms can jeopardize the stability of the roof in underground excavations and successful roof control can only be obtained if the failure mechanism is identified and understood properly. The presence of discontinuities, the inherent variability of the rock mass and discontinuity properties, and the uncertainties associated with directions and magnitudes of the in-situ stress makes the rock engineering problems challenging. The numerical modeling can assist the ground control engineers in designing and evaluating the stability of the underground excavations. If extensive geological and geotechnical data are available, then detailed predictions of deformation, stress and stability can be accomplished by performing numerical modeling. If not, still the numerical modeling can be used to perform parametric studies to gain insight into the possible ranges of responses of a system due to likely ranges of various parameters. The parametric studies can help to identify the key parameters and their impact on stability of underground excavations. The priorities of the material testing and site investigation can be set based on the selected key parameters from parametric studies. An underground coal mine in western Pennsylvania is selected as a case study mine to investigate the underlying causes of roof falls at this mine. The immediate roof at the case study mine consists of laminated silty shale, shale, or sandstone that changes from area to area, and the floor is shale or soft fireclay. This study was mainly focused in the stability analysis of the roofs with the laminated silty shale rock type, where the majority of roof falls had taken place in the roof with this type of roof material. Extensive laboratory tests were performed on the core samples obtained from the case study mine to estimate the intact rock and discontinuity properties of the materials that occur in large extent at the selected interest area of the case study mine. In this research, the three-dimensional distinct element method was used to investigate the stability of the roof in an underground room-and-pillar coal mine. The implemented technique was able to accurately capture the failure of the major discontinuities and rock masses which consist of intact rock and minor discontinuities. In order to accurately replicate the post failure behavior of the rock layers in the immediate roof area, the strain-softening material constitutive law was applied to this region. Extensive numerical parametric studies were conducted to investigate the effect of different parameters such as the variation of immediate roof rock mass strength properties, variation of discontinuity mechanical properties, orientations and magnitudes of the horizontal in-situ stresses, and the size of pillars and excavations on stability of the excavations. The distribution of post <b>failure</b> <b>cohesion</b> along with other measures such as accumulated plastic shear strain, distribution of Z-displacements at the roofline, failure state (joint slip and tensile failure) and displacement (normal and shear displacements) of discontinuities were used to accurately assess the roof stability in this case study. The research conducted in this dissertation showed that the bedding planes play an important role on the behavior of roof in underground excavations. Therefore, an appropriate numerical modeling technique which incorporates the effect of discontinuities should be employed to simulate the realistic behavior of the discontinuous rock masses such as the layered materials in roof strata of the underground coal mines. The three-dimensional distinct element method used in this research showed the clear superiority of this technique over the continuum based methods...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the current}} seal designs {{are based on the}} {{volumetric}} properties of materials and voids. In order to improve seal design, the possibility of introducing mechanistic principles into the seal design was investigated. Introducing mechanistic concepts into the seal design meant that principles such as elasticity and viscoelasticity could be used in terms of stress-strain to explain phenomena such as damage in the seal structure. Viscoelastic parameters of bituminous materials such as complex modulus (G?) and phase angle (?) are key elements in the understanding of performance, damage and failure of seal bituminous materials. Two main failure parameters of seal are <b>cohesion</b> <b>failure</b> (fatigue cracking due to ageing of binder and loss of elasticity) and adhesion failure or stripping (occurring between stone to bitumen or bitumen to base). The aim {{of this study was to}} model the response of a seal?s binder and the cohesion and adhesion damage of seals materials This Research also investigates the testing procedure of Cohesion Fatigue Damage (CFD) and Adhesion Fatigue Damage (AFD) of bituminous seal material using the Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR). The research was based on the Lifetime Optimisation Tool (LOT) research programme from Delft University of Technology. The response model was performed by means of the DSR parallel plate and modelled using the linear viscoelastic rheological master curves. In addition to the binder models an ageing model was developed base on the G* master curve using the recovered field-aged bitumens and the fresh binder from the plant. The modelling of CFD and AFD of the seal was based on investigated DRS test protocols results and was established on the ?stiffness reduction? principle of materials under the action of cyclic stress. From the ageing model it appeared that PAV ageing does not necessary simulate the long term ageing of bitumen. An investigation into ageing of non-modified and modified binder is suggested (e. g. by comparing PAV ageing with Q-sun ageing). The recovery of bitumen method needs to be revisited using technique such centrifugal force. The CFD and AFD models offer a practical advantage consisting of the possibility to be adapted and incorporated in the recursive simulation models as developed in the South African Road Design System (SARDS). It was observed that the generalised model for CFD depends more on stress, while the generalised model for AFD appears to depend more on temperature. This observation seems to agree with the fact that adhesion damage is more sensitive to temperature change, whereas cohesion damage is more prone to be influenced by applied fatigue stress. The CFD and AFD models provide an indication of non-linear development of the fatigue damage during-life period within bitumen and between bitumen and stone in the case of seal. This is represented by the modelling of the change of G?, as suggested in this investigation. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. tm 2016 Civil EngineeringPhDUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} known that soil erosion {{is an issue}} of concern in soil and water quality, {{affecting}} agriculture and natural resources. Thus, scientific efforts must take into consideration the high-resolution elevation dataset in order to implement a precision conservation approach effectively. New advances such as LiDAR products have provided a basic source of information to enable researchers to identify small erosional landscape features. To fill this gap, this study developed a methodology based on data mining of hydrologic and topographic attributes associated with concentrated flow path identification to distinguish classic gully side walls and bed areas. At 0. 91 Km 2 region of the Keigley Branch-South Skunk River watershed, an area with gullies, we computed profile curvature, mean slope deviation, stream power index, and aspect gridded in 1 -m pixel from Iowa LiDAR project. CLARA (CLustering LARge Applications) algorithm. An unsupervised clustering approach was employed on 913, 495 points splitting the dataset in six groups, the number in agreement with within-group sum of squared error (WSS) statistical technique. In addition, a new threshold criteria termed gully concentrated flow (GCF) based upon data distribution of flow accumulation and mean overall slope were introduced to produce polylines that identified the main hydrographic flow paths, corresponding to the gully beds. Cluster # 6 was classified as gully side walls. After distinguishing gullies and cliffs areas among points belonging to cluster 6, all six gullies were satisfactorily identified. The proposed methodology improves on existent techniques because identifies distinct parts of gullies which include side walls and bed zone. Another important concept is assessing gully slope stability in order to generate useful information for precision conservation planning. Although limit-equilibrium concept has been used widely in rock mechanics its application in precision conservation structures is relatively new. This study evaluated two multi-temporal surveys in a Western Iowa gullied area under the approach of soil stability regarding precision conservation practice The study computed factor of safety (FS) at the gully area, including headcut and gully side walls using digital elevation models originated from surveys conducted in 1999 and 2014. Outcomes of this assessment have revealed significantly less instability of the actual slopes compared to 1999 survey slopes. The internal friction angle (θ) had the largest effect on slope stability factor (S. D. 1999 = 0. 18, S. D. 2014 = 0. 24), according the sensitivity analysis, compared to variations of soil <b>cohesion,</b> <b>failure</b> plane angle and slab thickness. In addition, critically instable slopes within gully, based on units of the slope standard deviation, as a threshold, have produced an area of 61 m 2 and 396 m 2 considering the threshold of one and two slope standard deviation, respectively. The majority of these critical areas were located near the headcut and in the border of side walls. Based on current literature, association of processed material (geotextile) and crop cover with high root density might be an alternative to improve slope instability, but empirical tests are necessary to validate this approach. Nevertheless, the slope instability must include other factors that capture the dynamics of failure...|$|E
