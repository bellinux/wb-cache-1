40|$|In his seminal article Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness Granovetter {{argued that}} {{economic}} action {{is embedded in}} social relations and structures that affect its functioning, and that economic action should be analyzed as such. In theories of the business firm the idea that firms are socially embedded is widely acknowledged, but social context is typically understood as an exogenous force. When embeddedness is actually accounted for in theories of the business firm it is mostly as independent variable highlighting the structural aspects of embeddedness {{at the expense of}} more relational aspects. This short paper traces the origin and branching of embeddedness in business studies. It asserts that the concept of embeddedness is recurrently used as a <b>concept</b> <b>symbol</b> to reclassify aspects of social context, but not in a way that gives credit to the endogeneity of social context to the actions of the business firm. Finally, it is suggested that the notions of evolution and mutualism are fruitful for understanding how and why firms are embedded in different ways and to different degrees. Key words Embeddedness; economic activities; a theory of action; social structure; evolutionary economics; business studies; economic relationships; information; learning...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} resolution-based method for forgetting <b>concept</b> and role <b>symbols</b> in ALCH ontologies, or for {{computing}} uniform interpolants in ALCH. Uniform interpolants use only a restricted set of symbols, while preserving logical {{consequences of the}} original ontology involving these symbols. While recent work towards practical methods for uniform interpolation in expressive description logics limits attention to forgetting <b>concept</b> <b>symbols,</b> we believe most applications would benefit from the possibility to forget both role and <b>concept</b> <b>symbols.</b> We focus on the description logic ALCH, which allows for the formalisation of role hierarchies. Our approach {{is based on a}} recently developed resolutionbased calculus for forgetting <b>concept</b> <b>symbols</b> in ALC ontologies, which we extend by redundancy elimination techniques to make it practical for larger ontologies. Experiments on ALCH fragments of real life ontologies suggest that our method is applicable in a lot of real-life applications. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{citation}} is a composed indicator: short-term citations {{can be considered}} as currency at the research front, whereas long-term citations can contribute to the codification of knowledge claims into concept symbols. Knowledge claims at the research front {{are more likely to be}} transitory and are therefore problematic as indicators of quality. Citation impact studies focus on short-term citation, and therefore tend to measure not epistemic quality, but involvement in current discourses in which contributions are positioned by referencing. We explore this argument using three case studies: (1) citations of the journal Soziale Welt as an example of a venue that tends not to publish papers at a research front, unlike, for example, JACS; (2) Robert K. Merton as a <b>concept</b> <b>symbol</b> across theories of citation; and (3) the Multi-RPYS (“Multi-Referenced Publication Year Spectroscopy”) of the journals Scientometrics, Gene, and Soziale Welt. We show empirically that the measurement of “quality” in terms of citations can further be qualified: short-term citation currency at the research front can be distinguished from longer term processes of incorporation and codification of knowledge claims into bodies of knowledge. The recently introduced Multi-RPYS can be used to distinguish between short-term and long-term impacts...|$|E

We illustrate these two ways with Llull’s Ars Combinatoria and Leibniz’s attempts to arithmetize language, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} method for forgetting <b>concept</b> <b>symbols</b> in on-tologies {{specified}} in the description logic ALCOI. The method is an adaptation and improvement of a second-order quantifier elimination method developed for modal logics and used for computing correspon-dence properties for modal axioms. It follows an approach exploiting a result of Ackermann adapted to description logics. An important feature inherited from the modal approach is that the inference rules are guided by an ordering compatible with the elimination order of the concept sym-bols. This provides {{more control over the}} inference process and reduces non-determinism, resulting in a smaller search space. The method is ex-tended with a new case splitting inference rule, and several simplification rules. Compared to related forgetting and uniform interpolation methods for description logics, the method can handle inverse roles, nominals and ABoxes. Compared to the modal approach on which it is based, it is more efficient in time and improves the success rates. The method has been implemented in Java using the OWL API. Experimental results show that the order in which the <b>concept</b> <b>symbols</b> are eliminated significantly affects the success rate and efficiency. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} method for forgetting <b>concept</b> <b>symbols</b> and non-transitive roles symbols of SHQ-ontologies, or for {{computing}} uni-form interpolants in SHQ. Uniform interpolants restrict the symbols occuring in an ontology to a specified set, while preserving all logical entailments that can be expressed using this set in the description logic under consideration. Uniform interpolation has applications in ontology reuse, information hiding and ontology analysis, but so far no method for computing uniform interpolants for expressive description logics with number restrictions has been developed. Our results are not only inter-esting because they allow to compute uniform interpolants of ontologies using a more expressive language. Using number restrictions also allows to preserve more information in uniform interpolants of ontologies in less complex logics, such as ALC or EL. The presented method computes uni-form interpolants {{on the basis of}} a new resolution calculus for SHQ. The output of our method is expressed using SHQµ, which is SHQ extended with fixpoint operators, to always enable a finite representation of the uniform interpolant. If the uniform interpolant uses fixpoint operators, it can be represented in SHQ without fixpoints operators using additional <b>concept</b> <b>symbols</b> or by approximation. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In logics, {{there are}} many ways to {{represent}} same facts. With respect to both reasoning and cognitive complexity, some representations are significantly less efficient than others. In this paper, we investigate different means of improving the succinctness of TBoxes expressed in the lightweight description logic EL that forms a basis of some large ontologies used in practice. As a measure of size, we consider the number of references to signature elements. We investigate the problem of finding minimal equivalent representations and show that this task is NP-complete. A significant (up to triple-exponential) further improvement can be achieved by the introduction of auxiliary <b>concept</b> <b>symbols.</b> Thus, we additionally investigate the task of finding minimal representations for an ontology by extending its signature. Since arbitrary extension of the ontology with <b>concept</b> <b>symbols</b> can make the ontology unreadable, we only allow for auxiliary concepts acting as shortcuts for other concepts (EL concepts and disjunctions thereof) expressed by means of terms of the original ontology. We show that this task is also NP-complete if shortcuts represent only EL concepts, and between NP and Σ P 2, otherwise. ...|$|R

Moreover, generalized reference in DBS is not limited to names, but includes reference by means of matching <b>concepts</b> (<b>symbol)</b> and pointing (indexical). In addition, DBS treats coreference (identity) by means of address, which occurs as a variant of matching and pointer reference, and provides object permanence (“Object permanence by using address”) for baptism-based reference.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} method to compute uniform interpolants with fixpoints for ontologies {{specified}} in the description logic ALC. The aim of uniform interpolation is to reformulate an ontology such that it only uses a specified set of symbols, while preserving consequences that involve these symbols. It is known that in ALC uniform interpolants cannot always be finitely represented. Our method computes uniform interpolants for the target language ALCµ, which is ALC enriched with fixpoint operators, and always computes a finite representation. If the result does not involve fixpoint operators, it is the uniform interpolant in ALC. The method focuses on eliminating <b>concept</b> <b>symbols</b> and combines resolutionbased reasoning with an approach known from the area of second-order quantifier elimination to introduce fixpoint operators when needed. If fixpoint operators are not desired, {{it is possible to}} approximate the interpolant. ...|$|R

Multi-RPYS enables us to distinguish between short-term citation peaks at the research front that decay within ten years versus historically constitutive (long-term) citations that function as <b>concept</b> <b>symbols</b> (Small, 1978). Using these constitutive citations, one is able to cluster document sets (e. g., journals) in terms of intellectually shared histories. We test this premise by clustering 40 journals in the Web of Science Category of Information and Library Science using multi-RPYS. It follows that RPYS can not only be used for retrieving roots of sets under study (cited), but also for algorithmic historiography of the citing sets. Significant references are historically rooted symbols among other citations that function as currency...|$|R
