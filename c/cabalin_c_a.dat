25|$|Cebus a. versicolor is {{a complex}} which {{includes}} dark populations and lighter populations. It is thought to include the subspecies <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> leucocephalus and <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> pleei. Herskovitz's description of <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> pleei is of a very reddish animal, particularly in its limbs while <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> versicolor is <b>a</b> lighter red. <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> leucocephalus {{was described as a}} dark brown animal with reddish tonalities in the hind legs. Nevertheless, Hernández-Camacho and Cooper discuss evidence that the three subspecies (<b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> leucocephalus, <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> pleei and <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> versicolor) could be subsumed into one subspecies (<b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> versicolor), since the variations seem to be found in a very well-defined zone and even in the same groups, close to Barrancabermeja on the eastern bank of the middle Magdalena River in the Department of Santander. This strongly suggests that the dark phase (<b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> leucocephalus) and the light phase (<b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> pleei) are extremes of <b>an</b> intermediate (<b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> versicolor).|$|R

Objectives We examined response, toxicity, and survival after first-line <b>c</b> <b>a</b> p chemotherapy (<b>c</b> <b>a</b> p 1), or s o c and secondline <b>c</b> <b>a</b> p chemotherapy (<b>c</b> <b>a</b> p 2). Patients and Methods We searched <b>c</b> <b>a</b> p records for December 1999 to April 2006, abstracted charts, constructed a database, and undertook survival analyses. Treatment response, serious toxicities, and hospitalizations were recorded. Results We identified 32 esophageal (10 gastroesophageal junction) and 53 gastric cancer (62 %) patients, 55 of whom were stage M 1 at diagnosis. Prior therapy consisted of chemoradiotherapy (n = 14), adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 3), and radical surgery (n = 34). Of these 85 patients, 50 received <b>c</b> <b>a</b> p 1, and 35 received s o <b>c,</b> then <b>c</b> <b>a</b> p 2. Docetaxel and irinotecan regimens accounted for 34 % and 36 %, 5 % and 55 %, 16 % and 32 % respectively of first-, second-, and third-line <b>c</b> <b>a</b> p requests. Partial responses were documented with s o c (11 / 35, 31 %) and <b>c</b> <b>a</b> p 1 (6 / 50, 12 %).

40|$|Inflammatory {{action of}} the potent chemotaxin <b>C</b> 5 <b>a</b> has been well {{characterized}} {{on a variety of}} human cell types, including neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. The cellular effects of <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> are less well defined. Contradictory reports have been published for <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> activation of neutrophils. Recent reports that <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> activates both basophils and eosinophils prompted us to reinvestigate the effects of <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> stimulation on eosinophils. We hypothesized that <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> activation of eosinophils, cells that are present in most neutrophil preparations, might lead to neutrophil activation. Using neutrophils of 98 % purity, we observed no evidence of cellular activation after stimulation with either <b>C</b> 3 <b>a,</b> recombinant human <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> (rhC 3 a), or the synthetic <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> analogue <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> 57 - 77, Y 57. Eosinophils purified to > 98 % purity displayed concentration-dependent polarization, chemotaxis, and enzyme release by stimulation with <b>C</b> 3 <b>a,</b> rhC 3 a, and the synthetic <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> analogue. An inactive form of <b>C</b> 3 <b>a,</b> <b>C</b> 3 adesArg, failed to stimulate either eosinophils or neutrophils. Using neutrophil preparations containing 5 - 9 % eosinophils, up to 20 % of neutrophils became polarized after exposure to <b>C</b> 3 <b>a.</b> Likewise, we demonstrated that supernatant from C 3 a-stimulated eosinophils promotes neutrophil chemotaxis. Eosinophil polarization experiments were repeated in the presence of antibody to the <b>C</b> 5 <b>a</b> receptor (<b>C</b> 5 aR) to show that <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> and <b>C</b> 5 <b>a</b> interact with different receptors. <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> activates eosinophils in the presence of anti-C 5 aR antibody at concentrations that fully block <b>C</b> 5 <b>a</b> activation. We conclude that eosinophils are directly activated by either <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> or <b>C</b> 5 <b>a,</b> whereas <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> failed to activate neutrophils. <b>C</b> 3 <b>a</b> acts on eosinophils via a receptor that is distinct from C 5 aR.
