500|$|Project Chanology was {{formulated}} by {{users of the}} English-speaking imageboards 711chan.org and 4chan, the associated partyvan.info wiki, and several Internet Relay Chat channels, {{all part of a}} group collectively known as Anonymous, on January 16, 2008 after the Church of Scientology issued a copyright violation claim against YouTube for hosting material from the Cruise video. The effort against Scientology has also been referred to by group members as [...] "Operation Chanology". A webpage called [...] "Project Chanology", part of a larger wiki, is maintained by Anonymous and chronicles planned, ongoing and <b>completed</b> <b>actions</b> by project participants. The website includes a list of suggested guerrilla tactics to use against the Church of Scientology. Members use other websites as well to coordinate action, including Encyclopedia Dramatica and the social networking site Facebook, where two groups associated with the movement had 3,500 members as of February 4, 2008. A member of Anonymous told the Los Angeles Times that, as of February 4, 2008, the group consisted of [...] "a loose confederation of about 9,000 people" [...] who post anonymously on the Internet. A security analyst told The Age that the number of people participating anonymously in Project Chanology could number in the thousands: [...] "You can't pin it on a person or a group of people. You've thousands of people engaged to do anything they can against Scientology." ...|$|E

50|$|In English, <b>completed</b> <b>actions</b> in many {{contexts}} {{are referred}} to using the simple past verb form rather than the present perfect.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, aspect marking is not {{marked on}} the verb but with preverbal aspect markers such as deng (<b>completed</b> <b>actions)</b> and angat (incomplete action).|$|E
50|$|The simple constructions {{can be used}} {{to express}} {{habitual}} action. In many contexts they {{can also be used to}} express single <b>completed</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In {{all three}} cases, an event or <b>completed</b> <b>action</b> {{interrupts}} an ongoing state or action. For example, {{in the second}} sentence, the speaker states {{that he was in}} his room (expressed through the imperfect to reflect the ongoing or unfinished state of being there) when the other person [...] "interrupted" [...] that state by entering (expressed through the preterite to suggest a <b>completed</b> <b>action).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The past participle {{indicates}} <b>completed</b> <b>actions.</b> It is {{also used}} to form the perfect and the passive voice with a variety of auxiliary verbs. The formation of these is discussed in the section [...] "periphrastic forms".|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{having to}} do with the manner of an occurrence, {{compounds}} verbs are mostly used with <b>completed</b> <b>actions</b> and imperatives, and much less with negatives, conjunctives, and contexts continuous or speculative. This is because non-occurrences cannot be described to have occurred in a particular manner.|$|E
5000|$|Progressive action (denoted in English by the [...] "-ing" [...] verbal forms) is {{denoted by}} a {{separate}} particle ta, presumably derived from Portuguese está ("it is"). <b>Completed</b> <b>actions</b> are likewise {{indicated by the}} particle ja, presumably from Portuguese já ("right now" [...] or [...] "already").|$|E

50|$|The past participle {{can also}} be inflected with the inessive ending -(э)мын/-(е)мын. This is a predicative participle which expresses <b>completed</b> <b>action.</b>|$|R
50|$|Of these, the {{imperfect}} {{and perfect}} {{can be considered}} to represent a past tense combined with imperfective and perfective aspect respectively (the first is used for habitual or ongoing past actions or states, and the second for <b>completed</b> <b>actions).</b> The pluperfect and future perfect are relative tenses, referring to the past relative to a past time or relative to a future time.|$|E
50|$|Past tense: Past tense is {{indicated}} by either placing ได้ (dai, daj) before the verb or แล้ว (laew, lɛːw) after the verb or even using both in tandem for emphasis. แล้ว is the more common one, {{and can be used}} to indicate <b>completed</b> <b>actions</b> or current actions of the immediate past. ได้ is often used with negative statements and never for present action.|$|E
50|$|Analogous {{forms are}} found in some other {{languages}} and may also be described as present perfects although they often have other names such as the German Perfekt, the French passé composé and the Italian passato prossimo. They may also have different ranges of usage: in {{all three of the}} languages just mentioned, the forms in question serve as a general past tense, at least for <b>completed</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E

50|$|Verbs {{from the}} first type {{describe}} uncompleted actions (for example the verb мета could be roughly translated in English as to be sweeping), verbs from the second describe whole, <b>completed</b> <b>actions.</b> Verbs from the third type are a combination between the first two. Although they are imperfective as the initial ones, they preserve the perfective meaning of the second verbs, they are only grammatically imperfective.|$|E
5000|$|In non-Germanic Indo-European languages, past marking is {{typically}} {{combined with a}} distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect, with the former reserved for single <b>completed</b> <b>actions</b> in the past. French for instance, has an imperfect tense form {{similar to that of}} German but used only for past habitual or past progressive contexts like [...] "I used to..." [...] or [...] "I was doing...". Similar patterns extend across most languages of the Indo-European family right through to the Indic languages.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{his first}} {{exhibition}} at the Galleria Sperone in Turin in 1967, Gilberto Zorio's work {{has been linked to}} the history of Arte Povera. These first productions were strange objects, which were results of <b>completed</b> <b>actions</b> or ones that are still under way. Next came his work involving the action and reaction of the artist's body like in Odio ("hate" [...] in Italian), a word inscribed with an ax in a wall. The role of words and speech is essential in these pieces.|$|E

50|$|In Italian {{there are}} two pluperfects in the {{indicative}} mood: the recent pluperfect (trapassato prossimo) is formed correspondingly to French by using the imperfect of the appropriate auxiliary verb (essere or avere) plus the past participle. For example, Ero affamato perché non avevo mangiato I was hungry because I had not eaten. The remote pluperfect (trapassato remoto) is formed by using the preterite of the appropriate auxiliary verb plus the past participle. In the Italian consecutio temporum, the trapassato remoto {{should be used for}} <b>completed</b> <b>actions</b> in a clause subjugated to a clause whose verb is in the preterite.|$|E
5000|$|For action verbs, -ess [...] is {{used for}} <b>completed</b> <b>actions</b> or {{processes}} that result in a present state. The individual verb’s meaning can help determine which interpretation is appropriate. Hence kyel.hon-hayss ta [...] gyeorhon haetda can mean ‘got married’, focusing on the past event, or ‘is married’, focusing on the present state resulting from the past event. But kong ul chass ta [...] gong-eul chatda ‘kicked the ball’ can only denote a past action and cal sayngkyess ta [...] jal saenggyeotda ‘is handsome’ can only denote the present state. (sayngkita [...] saenggida is an action verb, meaning ‘get formed/created’.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Square {{brackets}} [...] {{were added}} around {{words that were}} inserted editorially, but were removed as of the 2006 printing. Double brackets were used to indicate text considered doubtful. The pronoun [...] "you" [...] was printed in small capitals (i.e., YOU) to indicate plurality, as were some verbs when plurality may be unclear. These features were discontinued in the 2013 release. The New World Translation attempts to indicate progressive rather than <b>completed</b> <b>actions,</b> such as [...] "proceeded to rest" [...] at Genesis 2:2 instead of [...] "rested". The 2013 release indicates progressive verbs only where considered contextually important.|$|E
50|$|The past participle is -(э)м/-(е)м. It is an attributive participle which expresses <b>completed</b> <b>action.</b> It is {{affixed to}} short stems in {{conjugation}} I verbs. The past participle caritive is -(э)мтэ/-(е)мтэ.|$|R
