Conventionally, roll stiffness distribution is tuned adjusting antiroll bars rather than roll <b>center</b> <b>height</b> (as both tend to have a similar effect on the sprung mass), but the height of the roll center is significant when considering the amount of jacking forces experienced.|$|E

50|$|In automobiles, {{a double}} {{wishbone}} suspension {{is an independent}} suspension design using two (occasionally parallel) wishbone-shaped arms to locate the wheel. Each wishbone or arm has two mounting points to the chassis and one joint at the knuckle. The shock absorber and coil spring mount to the wishbones to control vertical movement. Double wishbone designs allow the engineer to carefully control {{the motion of the}} wheel throughout suspension travel, controlling such parameters as camber angle, caster angle, toe pattern, roll <b>center</b> <b>height,</b> scrub radius, scuff and more.|$|E
50|$|The {{geometric}} {{roll center}} of the vehicle can be found by following basic geometrical procedures when the vehicle is static. However, when the vehicle rolls the roll centers migrate. It is this movement of roll centers that vehicle dynamics seek to control {{and in most cases}} limit. The rapid movement of roll centers when the system experiences small displacements can lead to stability problems with the vehicle. The roll <b>center</b> <b>height</b> has been shown to affect behavior at the initiation of turns such as nimbleness and initial roll control.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the link between the attenuation coefficients and the interferometric phase <b>center</b> <b>heights,</b> for several frequencies from P- to L-band, and to study the extent to which it depends on the canopy architecture and description. This paper relies on the use of a coherent and full polarimetric scattering model, which simulates the fields backscattered by a forested area. In the first part, we study the behavior with a frequency of the interferometric phase <b>center</b> <b>heights,</b> and in the second part, we focus on the attenuation coefficients. Then, we compare the behaviors of these two quantities, and we propose to empirically derive a relation between these two quantities and the mean forest height. Finally, we investigate if a change in the initial forest or radar configuration has an impact on the determination of this relation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{roll center}} {{is one of}} the key {{parameters}} for designing a suspension. Several driving characteristics are affected significantly by the migration of the roll center during the suspension’s motion. The strut/SLA (strut/short-long-arm) suspension, which is widely used in production cars, combines the space-saving characteristics of a MacPherson strut suspension with some of the preferred handling characteristics of an SLA suspension. In this study, a front strut/SLA suspension is modeled by ADAMS/Car software. Kinematic roll analysis is then employed to investigate how the rolling characteristics change under the wheel travel and steering input. The related parameters, including the roll <b>center</b> <b>height,</b> roll camber gain, toe change, scrub radius and wheel track width change, are analyzed and discussed. It is found that the strut/SLA suspension clearly has a higher roll center than strut and SLA suspensions do. The variations in the roll <b>center</b> <b>height</b> under roll analysis are very different as the wheel travel displacement and steering angle are added. The results of the roll camber gain, scrub radius and wheel track width change are considered satisfactory. However, the toe change is too large and needs fine-tuning through a sensitivity analysis.
