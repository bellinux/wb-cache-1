5|$|Metal {{artefacts}} {{share the}} same geometric designs {{that are used in}} other forms of Islamic art. However, in the view of Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they are most often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork <b>can</b> <b>form</b> a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they <b>can</b> <b>form</b> the background pattern.|$|E

5|$|Rubidium and caesium <b>can</b> <b>form</b> a {{great variety}} of suboxides with the metals in formal {{oxidation}} states below +1. Rubidium <b>can</b> <b>form</b> Rb6O and Rb9O2 (copper-coloured) upon oxidation in air, while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides, such as the ozonide CsO3 and several brightly coloured suboxides, such as Cs7O (bronze), Cs4O (red-violet), Cs11O3 (violet), Cs3O (dark green), CsO, Cs3O2, as well as Cs7O2. The last of these may be heated under vacuum to generate Cs2O.|$|E
5|$|Squall lines, or solid {{bands of}} strong thunderstorms, <b>can</b> <b>form</b> ahead of cold fronts and lee troughs {{due to the}} {{presence}} of significant atmospheric moisture and strong upper level divergence, leading to hail and high winds. When significant directional wind shear exists in the atmosphere ahead of a cold front {{in the presence of a}} strong upper level jet stream, tornado formation is possible. Although tornadoes <b>can</b> <b>form</b> anywhere on Earth, the greatest number occur in the Great Plains in the United States, because downsloped winds off the north-south oriented Rocky Mountains, which <b>can</b> <b>form</b> a dryline, aid their development at any strength.|$|E

5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They <b>can</b> <b>form</b> in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm. From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
5|$|After Neil Bartlett's {{discovery}} in 1962 that xenon <b>can</b> <b>form</b> chemical compounds, {{a large number}} of xenon compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen. The chemistry of xenon in each oxidation state is analogous to that of the neighboring element iodine in the immediately lower oxidation state.|$|E

5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides <b>can</b> <b>form</b> on the metal and under {{the lid of the}} container, and can detonate upon opening.|$|E
5|$|Binary and multi-star systems {{consist of}} two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and {{generally}} move around each other in stable orbits.

5|$|Carbon <b>can</b> <b>form</b> {{very long}} chains of {{interconnecting}} carbon–carbon bonds, a property {{that is called}} catenation. Carbon-carbon bonds are strong and stable. Through catenation, carbon forms a countless number of compounds. A tally of unique compounds shows that more contain carbon that those that do not. A similar claim {{can be made for}} hydrogen because most organic compounds also contain hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is brittle, and behaves as a {{semiconductor}} in {{a direction}} perpendicular to its planes. Most of its chemistry is nonmetallic; it has a relatively high ionization energy and, compared to most metals, a relatively high electronegativity. Carbon <b>can</b> <b>form</b> anions such as C4− (methanide), C (acetylide) and C (sesquicarbide or allylenide), in compounds with metals of main groups 1–3, and with the lanthanides and actinides. Its oxide CO2 forms carbonic acid H2CO3.|$|E
5|$|Category5 hurricanes are {{tropical}} cyclones {{that reach}} Category5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. They are by definition the strongest hurricanes that <b>can</b> <b>form</b> on planet Earth. They are {{rare in the}} eastern Pacific Ocean and generally form only once every several years. In general, Category5s form in clusters in single years. Landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, bacteria <b>can</b> <b>form</b> complex {{associations with}} other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic scars are uncommon, and are {{characterized}} by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin. Hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins of the wound, whereas keloid scars <b>can</b> <b>form</b> scar tissue outside of these borders.
