25|$|The {{soil cover}} of Bulgaria is diverse. The soil {{resources}} {{of the country are}} adequately researched and include 17 soil types and 28 sub-types. Of them, six types form 88,7% of the soil cover: cinnamon soils (22,0%); <b>chernozem</b> (20,4%); grey forest soils (17,0%); brown forest soils (14,8%); alluvial soils (9,0%) and smolnitsi (5,4%).|$|E
25|$|The Black Sea {{coast is}} hilly and verdant, mostly cliff, {{with a couple}} of rocky {{headlands}} (Cape Galata, Cape St. Athanasius), several expansive sand beaches, the largest of which, at the mouths of the rivers Kamchiya and Shkorpilovska, is nearly 13km long and up to 200–300 m wide, and many small cove beaches. Agricultural lands cover 60% of the area, with fertile <b>chernozem</b> soils mostly in the north and west; forests—28.1% (with some of the oldest oak massives in the nation), mostly in the south; and urban zones—6.8%.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominant}} soil {{types are}} loess in the north, reaching {{a depth of}} up to 100m at {{the banks of the}} Danube, and <b>chernozem</b> in the south. The climate is temperate. The flat relief and the openness of plain to the north facilitate arrival of moist air masses in spring, summer and autumn. In winter the Danubian Plain falls {{under the influence of the}} Eastern European anticyclone, which brings cold Arctic air masses. The mean temperature in January is –1°C and in July is 24°C, making it the geomorphological region with the highest average annual amplitude in Bulgaria— 25°C.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{examples}} for {{the reaction of}} <b>chernozems</b> {{in the center of}} the East European Plain and their relation to different periodical climatic changes are examined. According to unequal-age <b>chernozems</b> properties, the transition from the Middle Holocene arid conditions to the Late Holocene wet conditions occurred at 4000  yr BP. Using data on changes of soil properties, the position of boundary between steppe and forest-steppe and the annual amount of precipitation at approximately 4000  yr BP were reconstructed. The change from warm-dry to cool-moist climatic phases, which occurred at the end of the XX century as a reflection of intra-age-long climatic cyclic recurrence, led to the strengthening of dehumification over the profile of automorphic <b>chernozems</b> and to the reduction of its content in the upper meter of the soils. The leaching of carbonates and of readily soluble salts contributed to the decrease in soil areas occupied by typical and solonetzic <b>chernozems,</b> and to the increase in areas occupied by leached <b>chernozems.</b> </span...|$|R

25|$|Long {{associated}} with traditional images of Russian landscape and cossacks on horseback are the steppes, which are treeless, grassy plains. Although they covered only 15 percent of Soviet territory, the steppes were home to roughly 44 {{percent of the}} population. They extend for 4,000 kilometers from the Carpathian Mountains in the western Ukrainian Republic across most of the northern portion of the Kazakh Republic in Soviet Central Asia, between the taiga and arid zones, occupying a relatively narrow band of plains whose <b>chernozem</b> soils {{are some of the}} most fertile on earth. In a country of extremes, the steppe zone, with its moderate temperatures and normally adequate levels of sunshine and moisture, provides the most favorable conditions for human settlement and agriculture. Even here, however, agricultural yields were sometimes adversely affected by unpredictable levels of precipitation and occasional catastrophic droughts.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} soil zones. The Northern forest-steppe zone covers the Danubian Plain and the Pre-Balkan up to 600–700m altitude. The Danubian Plain is characterised by the fertile black earth <b>chernozem,</b> that {{accounts}} for 54% of the zone's area, while the Pre-Balkan is dominated by grey forest soils (39%), which have good physical characteristics but are low in organic matter and phosphorus. The Southern xerothermal zone encompasses Southern Bulgaria up to 700–800m altitude and includes several specific soil types due to the more diverse topography and climate. The most common soil types are the cinnamon forest soils with acidic (cinnamonic) traces, smolnitsi and yellow-podzolic soils. The Mountain zone covers the mountainous regions above 700–800m altitude and has a zonal soil cover. The brown forest soils are distributed at altitudes of 1000–2000m, the dark mountain forest soils {{can be found at}} 1700–2200m altitude and the mountain meadow soils— above 1700m. These soils are typically shallow and prone to erosion and are usually acid to strongly acid.|$|E

2500|$|Most historians {{agree that}} the {{disruption}} caused by collectivization and {{the resistance of the}} peasants significantly contributed to the Great Famine of 19321933, especially in Ukraine, a region famous for its rich soil (<b>chernozem).</b> This particular period is called [...] "Holodomor" [...] in Ukrainian. During the similar famines of 19211923, numerous campaigns – inside the country, as well as internationally – were held to raise money and food in support {{of the population of the}} affected regions. Nothing similar was done during the drought of 19321933, mainly because the information about the disaster was suppressed by Stalin. Stalin also undertook a purge of the Ukrainian communists and intelligentsia, with devastating long-term effects on the area. Many Ukrainian villages were blacklisted and penalized by government decree for perceived sabotage of food supplies. Moreover, migration of population from the affected areas was restricted. According to Stalin in his conversation with the prize-winning writer Mikhail Sholokhov, the famine was caused by the excesses of local party workers and sabotage, [...] "I've thanked you for the letters, as they expose a sore in our Party-Soviet work and show how our workers, wishing to curb the enemy, sometimes unwittingly hit friends and descend to sadism. ... the esteemed grain-growers of your district (and not only of your district alone) carried on an 'Italian strike' (sabotage!) and were not loath to leave the workers and the Red Army without bread. That the sabotage was quiet and outwardly harmless (without blood) does not change the fact that the esteemed grain-growers waged what was in fact a 'quiet' war against Soviet power. A war of starvation, dear com Sholokhov. This, of course, can in no way justify the outrages, which, as you assure me, have been committed by our workers. ... And those guilty of those outrages must be duly punished".|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} {{conditions of the}} evolution of <b>chernozems</b> in Central Europe have not been satisfactory explained. In this paper, seven buried <b>chernozems</b> were investigated using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in order to get information about the former vegetation cover. Near-infrared (NIR) data were collected from organic matter of recent natural grasslands and forests. The spectra from these two groups of soils were perfectly discriminated by a multivariate statistical analysis. The statistical model was applied on the buried soils. There are four types of vegetation development within the <b>chernozems</b> before the burial. Comparison to other paleoenvironmental proxies shows no major contradiction and confirms the potential of the NIRS as a paleopedological proxy. The identified changes of vegetation are from grassland vegetation to forest vegetation and vice versa. These changes bring new data to the discussion about the pedogenesis of <b>chernozems.</b> According to the radiocarbon dating, buried soils developed and were preserved not only in the Preboreal and the Boreal, but also in later phases of the Holocene. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate effects of minimum (MT) and conventional tillage (CT) on soil organic matter and soil structure in haplic <b>Chernozems</b> and mollic Fluvisols. The content of soil organic carbon (Corg) as well as parameters of stability and vulnerability of soil structure were quantified. The results showed that soil type had statistically significant influence on Corg. In haplic <b>Chernozems</b> the Corg content near the surface (0 – 0. 1 m) was significantly higher under MT (by 6 %) compared to CT, however, in layer 0 – 0. 3 m under CT the average Corg content was by 16 % higher than under MT. In mollic Fulvisols under MT, the average Corg content (17. 5 ± 5. 4 g*kg- 1) was significantly less for the 0 – 0. 3 m layer than the CT (22. 7 ± 0. 4 g*kg- 1). In <b>Chernozems,</b> total content of water-stable micro-aggregates (WSAmi) was higher in MT (90. 8 %) than in CT (69. 5 %). In mollic Fluvisols, the average content of WSAmi was higher in CT (62. 5 %) than in MT (53. 2 %). The low aggregate stability and the high structure vulnerability were reflected also due to the high contents of WSAmi in both soils. The stability of aggregates was a higher in mollic Fluvisols than in haplic <b>Chernozems.</b> In haplic <b>Chernozems,</b> better soil structure stability was under CT than MT, on the other hand, in mollic Fluvisols, the average value of coefficient of aggregate stability was lower by 32 % in CT than MT...|$|R
40|$|A well-based {{knowledge}} about the former distribution of <b>Chernozems</b> and Phaeozems is necessary to (i) better understand the factors influencing formation and degradation of these highly fertile soils, and (ii) better explain prehistoric settlement patterns that were also determined by natural factors such as soil fertility. During this archaeopedological study carried out in Central Germany we applied sedimentological and micromorphological methods to compare soils and pedosediments from the recent Chernozem/Phaeozem region with black-coloured pedosediments buried in early Neolithic structures of the recent Luvisol area directly to the east. Relocated clay coatings and significantly lower magnetic enhancement compared to Chernozem/Phaeozem-derived material were found in most black-coloured pedosediments in the Luvisol area. This demonstrates that despite their location next to an extensive Chernozem/Phaeozem area these sediments do not originate from <b>Chernozems</b> or Phaeozems. Instead, their dark colour must either originate from anthropogenic input similar to black-coloured Anthrosols (“Dark Earth”), or must stem from Ah-material of former Luvisols. Consequently, may be apart from a small relatively dry and carbonate-rich Luvisol region northwest of Leipzig there was obviously no significantly larger distribution of Neolithic <b>Chernozems</b> and Phaeozems in this region during the past. Consequently, the regional early Neolithic settlers of the Linear Pottery Culture settled intensively also in areas outside the distribution of <b>Chernozems</b> and Phaeozems, and the activities of these settlers {{did not lead to}} the formation of such soils. Thus, fertile soils were obviously only one factor among probably others to explain the regional Neolithic settlement pattern. Significantly lower carbonate contents were found for the parent material of the black-coloured pedosediments in the Luvisol region compared with the parent material of Chernzems and Phaeozems. This demonstrates that the decisive factor to explain the recent and former spatial distribution of <b>Chernozems</b> and Phaeozems in this relatively dry area is the carbonate dynamics. Anthropogenic activity since the early Neolithic period obviously helped to preserve the naturally formed <b>Chernozems</b> and Phaeozems by re-carbonatization processes, but humans were not the main soil forming factor in early settled regions...|$|R
40|$|Tillage {{may affect}} the {{microstructural}} organization of soil, including the distribution of microaggregates with different mechanical strengths. We quantified the impact of tillage treatment on the amount and distribution of free organic matter, microaggregates (unstable and stable under low intensity sonification) and their components, in the upper horizons of zonal soils of the Center of the Russian Plain. Under plowing, the carbon content decreases, both in unstable and stable microaggregates. The loss of carbon in unstable microaggregates was ~ 24 %, whereas in stable microaggregates, it was ~ 37 %, relative to native soils. The carbon content of organic (LFoc) and organo-clay (Clayrd) fractions in unstable microaggregates (CLFoc/CClayrd) was almost identical in the upper horizons of native soils: the ratio of these components is for Albeluvisols (1. 1), Phaeozem (0. 8) and <b>Chernozems</b> (1. 0). Under plowing, these decrease to: Albeluvisols and <b>Chernozems</b> (0. 6) and Phaeozem (0. 5). The shares of carbon accumulated within the unstable and stable microaggregates (Cunstable/Cstable) are constant under equilibrium conditions and show a tendency to decrease {{from north to south}} on the order of: Albeluvisols and Phaeozem (2. 2) > <b>Chernozems</b> (1. 0).
