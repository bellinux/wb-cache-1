50|$|The {{remodeling}} of bone {{in response}} to loading is achieved via mechanotransduction, a process through which forces or other mechanical signals are converted to biochemical signals in cellular signaling. Mechanotransduction leading to bone remodeling involve the steps of mechanocoupling, biochemical <b>coupling,</b> <b>signal</b> transmission, and cell response. The specific effects on bone structure depends on the duration, magnitude and rate of loading, {{and it has been}} found that only cyclic loading can induce bone formation. When loaded, fluid flows away from areas of high compressive loading in the bone matrix. Osteocytes are the most abundant cells in bone and are also the most sensitive to such fluid flow caused by mechanical loading. Upon sensing a load, osteocytes regulate bone remodeling by signaling to other cells with signaling molecules or direct contact. Additionally, osteoprogenitor cells, which may differentiate into osteoblasts or osteoclasts, are also mechanosensors and may differentiate one way or another depending on the loading condition.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} mutual {{coupling}} of chaotic lasers and observe both experimentally and in numeric simulations, that {{there exists a}} regime of parameters for which two mutually coupled chaotic lasers establish isochronal synchronization, while a third laser coupled unidirectionally {{to one of the}} pair, does not synchronize. We then propose a cryptographic scheme, based on the advantage of mutual-coupling over unidirectional coupling, where all the parameters of the system are public knowledge. We numerically demonstrate that in such a scheme the two communicating lasers can add a message signal (compressed binary message) to the transmitted <b>coupling</b> <b>signal,</b> and recover the message in both directions with high fidelity by using a mutual chaos pass filter procedure.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a technique for synchronizing arrays {{of a class}} of chaotic systems known as Sprott circuits. This technique {{can be applied to}} different topologies and is robust to parametric uncertainties caused by tolerances in the electronic components. The design of <b>coupling</b> <b>signals</b> is based on the definition of a set of functionals which depend on the errors between the outputs of the nodes and the errors between the output of a reference system and the outputs of the nodes. When there are no parametric uncertainties, we establish a criterion to design the <b>coupling</b> <b>signals</b> using only one state variable of each system. When the parametric uncertainties are present, we add a robust observer and a low pass filter to estimate the perturbation terms, which are subsequently compensated through the <b>coupling</b> <b>signals,</b> resulting in a robust closed loop system.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 86 - 88. Research into stepped {{frequency}} {{continuous wave}} {{ground penetrating radar}} (SFCW GPR) at UCT {{has been carried out}} since 1990. A first generation system comprising of Hewlett-Packard test equipment controlled by a PC was assembled. Cavity-backed log spiral antennas were designed and built by the University of Stellenbosch for the specific use of ground penetrating radar. Measurements with the first generation system proved the concept of SFCW GPR and thus a dedicated second generation system was planned. A SFCW GPR system was designed to replace the first generation system. Various designs for transmitter and receiver configurations were investigated and those found most suitable were used for the implementation. The SFCW radar consists of a wideband CW transmitter and a coherent receiver. A 300 - 1000 MHz transmitter was constructed using varactor-tuned oscillators as frequency sources. A double-sideband, low-IF receiver was constructed for the 300 - 1000 MHz signal, to mix it to an IF of 10. 7 MHz and I-Q demodulate it. The transmitter was found to operate according to specifications. The receiver was found to operate satisfactorily, but the dynamic range was less than expected. A limiting problem encountered in the first generation GPR was the large direct <b>coupling</b> <b>signal</b> from the transmitter into the receiver. This large signal reduced the effective receiver dynamic range. A method of cancelling this large direct <b>coupling</b> <b>signal</b> was implemented, using a bi-phase modulator to generate the cancelling signal in antiphase to the <b>coupling</b> <b>signal.</b> A 20 dB reduction in coupling was shown. The system was used to measure cable lengths to within the inherent accuracy of the system. A metal plate target was detected by the system feeding two antenna and a concrete floor was detected under 1 m of sand. It was thus shown that the SFCW system {{could be used as a}} second generation GPR...|$|E

40|$|In general, {{it is very}} {{difficult}} to measure the information flow in a cellular network directly. In this study, based on an information flow model and microarray data, we measured the information flow in cellular networks indirectly by using a systems biology method. First, we used a recursive least square parameter estimation algorithm to identify the system parameters of <b>coupling</b> <b>signal</b> transduction pathways and the cellular gene regulatory network (GRN). Then, based on the identified parameters and systems theory, we estimated the signal transductivities of the <b>coupling</b> <b>signal</b> transduction pathways from the extracellular signals to each downstream protein and the information transductivities of the GRN between transcription factors in response to environmental events. According to the proposed method, the information flow, which is characterized by signal transductivity in coupling signaling pathways and information transductivity in the GRN, can be estimated by microarray temporal data or microarray sample data. It can also be estimated by other high-throughput data such as next-generation sequencing or proteomic data. Finally, the information flows of the signal transduction pathways and the GRN in leukemia cancer cells and non-leukemia normal cells were also measured to analyze the systematic dysfunction in this cancer from microarray sample data. The results show that the signal transductivities of signal transduction pathways change substantially from normal cells to leukemia cancer cells...|$|E
