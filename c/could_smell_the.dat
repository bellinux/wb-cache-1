500|$|In America Epstein {{had met the}} {{well-known}} divorce lawyer, Nat Weiss, whom Epstein later asked {{to take over the}} merchandising affairs of the Beatles and NEMS. Weiss would later state, [...] "The reality is that the Beatles never saw a penny out of the merchandising... Tens of millions of dollars went down the drain {{because of the way the}} whole thing was mishandled. Even after the judgement was vacated, you <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> smoke from the ashes, that's how badly they had been burned." [...] Beatles' memorabilia, licensed by Seltaeb, is still sold at Beatles' conventions and on the internet.|$|E
500|$|Pilots {{nicknamed the}} Thunderjet [...] "The Lead Sled". It was also called [...] "The Iron Crowbar", [...] "a hole sucking air", [...] "The Hog" [...] ("The Groundhog"), and [...] "The World's Fastest Tricycle", [...] "Ground Loving Whore" [...] as a {{testament}} to its long takeoff rolls. F-84 lore stated that all aircraft were equipped with a [...] "sniffer" [...] device that, upon passing V2, would look for the dirt {{at the end of}} the runway. As soon as the device <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> dirt, the controls would turn on and let the pilot fly off the ground. In the same vein, it was suggested a bag of dirt should be carried in the front landing gear well. Upon reaching V2, the pilot would dump the dirt under the wheels, fooling the sniffer device.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{adapted the}} lyric for [...] "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" [...] from an 1843 poster for Pablo Fanque's circus that he {{purchased}} at an antique shop in Kent {{on the day}} of filming the promotional film for [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever". Womack views the track as an effective blending of a print source and music: [...] "The interpretive power of the mixed-media application accrues its meaning through the musical production with which the group imbues the Ur-text of the poster." [...] MacDonald notes Lennon's request for a [...] "fairground production wherein one <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> sawdust", an atmosphere that Martin and Emerick attempted to create with a sound collage that comprised randomly assembled recordings of harmoniums, harmonicas and calliopes. MacDonald describes the song as [...] "a spontaneous expression of its author's playful hedonism". Everett thinks that the track's use of Edwardian imagery thematically links it with the album's opening number.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{stared at}} the old hunter and {{likewise}} sniffed. I followed their lead, but all I <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> was <b>the</b> thick, piney odor of the forest.|$|R
60|$|I <b>could</b> have <b>smelled</b> <b>the</b> new-mown hay if it wasn't {{that when}} you're in Geisenheimer's {{you have to}} smell Geisenheimer's, because it leaves no chance for competition.|$|R
6000|$|To Audrey {{everything}} in the room seemed to go round; yet all her senses were preternaturally acute, so that she <b>could</b> distinctly <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> mud of the river at low tide. She said, with a shudder: ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{the unit}} was {{originally}} {{located in the}} top floor of 'F' block patients often used to complain that they could smell beer and think that they were going mad. Little did they know that [...] "The Bees Knees" [...] pub was in located nearby in the basement below 'G' block - They really <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> beer.|$|E
2500|$|Newspaper reviewers praised Wind, Whales and Whisky as entertaining, joyful and informative. One, {{who grew}} up on Cape Breton Island, wrote that the book brought back many memories: [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> salt and feel the warmth of those country kitchens and hear the intoxicating song of the fiddle...There are moonshiners and poets in this book, {{fishermen}} and ghosts, Buddhist monks and singing coal miners, cock-fighters and priests. There's also a pretty good recipe for moonshine you could try if you're willing to risk $500 in fines and maybe six months in jail." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, {{apparently}} {{concerned about}} leaving evidence behind, Himmler ordered that the bodies at Rumbula be dug up and burned. [...] (Similar actions were taken at Belzec extermination camp in German occupied Poland.) [...] This {{work was done}} by a detachment of Jewish slave laborers. [...] Persons travelling on the railway could readily smell the burning corpses. In 2001, the President of the Republic of Latvia, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, who was a child during World War II, spoke at a 60-year anniversary memorial service about {{the destruction of the}} bodies: [...] "We <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> smoke coming from Rumbula, where corpses were being dug up and burnt to erase the evidence." ...|$|E
50|$|This {{game was}} {{lopsided}} {{and by the}} end of the third quarter, with a 22-6 advantage over the California Golden Bears, Iowa <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> victory. <b>The</b> championship, however, is disputed. The AP, whose poll came out before the bowl games, had picked LSU as their National Champion. Many believe that the Iowa Hawkeyes rightfully hold the 1958 National Championship.|$|R
50|$|The blast {{was caused}} by a natural gas leak. According to a head of the Prague Fire Service, gas <b>could</b> be <b>smelled</b> in <b>the</b> area {{following}} in the blast, causing risk of further explosions.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No! From the {{bilberries}} {{under the}} snow. Doesn't {{it look as}} if it were distilled from snow. Can you--' she sniffed, and sniffed at <b>the</b> bottle--'can you <b>smell</b> bilberries? Isn't it wonderful? It is exactly as if one <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> them through <b>the</b> snow.' ...|$|R
60|$|Already I <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> {{smoke that}} was {{pouring out of}} the cracks around the hatchway. It {{would not be a}} great while before the entire vessel would be consumed.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a shame!" [...] he said, {{bending down}} to stroke {{her hand and}} her arm. She drew back smiling, {{flushing}} with joy. I <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> white lilies where I sat.|$|E
60|$|The exact {{locality}} of {{the fire}} was plain {{to him as he}} neared home. He soon could hear the shout of men, the flapping of the flames, the crackling of burning wood, and <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> smoke from the conflagration.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was all}} dark to Dick. He <b>could</b> only <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> camels, the hay-bales, the cooking, {{the smoky}} fires, and the tanned canvas of the tents as he stood, where he had dropped from the train, {{shouting}} for George. There was a sound of light- hearted kicking on the iron skin of the rear trucks, with squealing and grunting. George was unloading the mules.|$|R
60|$|Old Admiral Sanchez was wont to {{maintain}} that he <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> thirty, and <b>the</b> men of the first ship in which I sailed claimed that Coburn, the navigating officer, knew by name every wave along thirty from 60dN. to 60dS. However, I'd hate to vouch for this.|$|R
50|$|Everything about Warli is earthy and soothing. It {{takes you}} back to the painting’s {{provenance}} where you <b>could</b> almost <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> wet soil, feel the touch of the calloused hand that painted the background and admire meticulous brush stroke of the rural artist who created the master piece. Warli paintings succeed in adding elegance to a rural hut or a five star hotel lobby with the same charm.|$|R
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> raw whiskey on the mate's breath. Yet {{he did not}} stagger nor {{show any}} signs of intoxication. Not until {{afterward}} was I to know that his willingness to talk was most unwonted and was where the liquor gave him away.|$|E
6000|$|... "The boy hid the bad pumpkin {{behind him}} till {{his mother was}} gone, because he didn't want her in the secret; and then he slipped into the house, and put it under his bed. It was pretty lonesome {{up there in the}} boy's room--he slept in the garret, and there was nothing but broken {{furniture}} besides his bed; but all day long it <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> good little pumpkin, boiling and boiling for pies; and late at night, after the boy had gone to sleep, it <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> hot pies when they came out of the oven. They smelt splendid, but the bad little pumpkin didn't envy them a bit; it just said, 'Pooh! What's twenty pumpkin pies to one pumpkin-glory?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had fever, you know, but {{the thing}} was remarkably real. It was like lantern {{pictures}} melting on the screen. Background and figures were accurate and lifelike. In the last scene, I knew I was in Columbine's cabin and can hardly persuade myself I was quite asleep. The tide splashed about the boat; I <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> mud." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{most of the}} Stoics did {{not look}} at them at all, feeling that their soft hearts could not stand these painful sights, and anxious not to spoil their dinners. Gregory did not see them either, for it so {{happened}} that he was looking at the sky, and just then the two girls crossed the road and were lost among the passers-by, for they were not dogs, who <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> out <b>the</b> kind of man he was.|$|R
5000|$|Code Eleven {{begins when}} a SkyClan warrior named Poppycloud and her {{apprentice}} accidentally overstep the ThunderClan border and were caught. The leader of ThunderClan {{goes to the}} SkyClan leader and tells him what is going on. Poppycloud explains that they <b>could</b> not <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> border {{because it was not}} freshly made, which brings up the decision to remark their borders daily. (In a mini-story, Whitestorm teaches Firepaw, Graypaw, Ravenpaw, Sandpaw, and Dustpaw about border tactics.) ...|$|R
50|$|His {{paintings}} were highly prized and {{collected at the}} court of Frederik Hendrik in the Hague. There, the art collector and secretary to the prince Constantijn Huygens praised the paintings in poetry and corresponded numerous times with the artist, writing that one <b>could</b> almost <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> flowers. The Dutch poet Joost van den Vondel also wrote highly of Seghers' paintings. Other collectors included Christina of Sweden, Charles I, Philip IV of Spain, Maria de' Medici and Charles II, who visited the artist in 1649, and Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria.|$|R
60|$|Siegmund, rebuffed by {{the only}} one in the house from whom he might have {{expected}} friendship, proceeded slowly to shave, feeling sick at heart. He was a long time over his toilet. When he stripped himself for the bath, it seemed to him he <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> sea. He bent his head and licked his shoulder. It tasted decidedly salt.|$|E
60|$|Alf's rigorously limited {{powers of}} comprehending Torpenhow"s special {{correspondence}} had waked the devil of unrest in Dick. He could hear, through the boy's nasal chant, the camels grunting in the squares behind the soldiers outside Suakin; {{could hear the}} men swearing and chaffing across the cooking pots, and <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> acrid wood-smoke as it drifted over camp before the wind of the desert.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more she}} leaned towards me. The {{wind was blowing}} around us, she came closer as though seeking for the shelter of my body. I <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> crushed violets, which she was still wearing at her bosom; her eyes were soft and bright, her lips were {{slightly}} parted. I took her into my arms--she clung {{to me for a}} moment--one long, delicious moment.|$|E
50|$|The 2010 Festival, held in Birmingham with Aston University as lead University partner, {{featured}} a prank event: {{the unveiling of}} Dulcis foetidus, a fictional plant purported to emit a pungent odour. An experiment in herd mentality, some audience members were induced into believing they <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> it. <b>The</b> Festival also hosts the x-change- a lively informal roundup of the day's events where festival-goers can ask questions, debate and hear star speakers.The Festival has also been the home to protest and debate. In 1970 there were protestors {{over the use of}} science for weapons.|$|R
6000|$|It {{must not}} be supposed, then, that our friend John Bax--{{sometimes}} called [...] "captain," [...] sometimes [...] "skipper," [...] not unfrequently [...] "mister," [...] but most commonly [...] "Bax," [...] without any modification--was a hopeless castaway, because he was found by his friend Guy Foster {{in a room full}} of careless foul-mouthed seamen, eating his bread and cheese and drinking his beer in an atmosphere so impregnated with tobacco smoke that he could scarcely see, and so redolent of gin that he <b>could</b> scarcely <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> smoke! ...|$|R
5000|$|Richard Wagamese in {{his review}} criticised Bergen for {{presenting}} [...] "little of the racial tension that <b>could</b> be <b>smelled</b> in <b>the</b> air like cordite". Canadian author and critic Geoff Pevere in his The Toronto Star review criticed novel's narrative tone and mentioned that it is [...] "long on incident and short on joy".|$|R
60|$|An early moon silvered {{the long}} slopes of wheat {{and made the}} alfalfa squares seem black. A cool, faint, sweet breeze fanned her cheek. She <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> {{fragrance}} of apples, of new-mown hay, and {{she could hear the}} low murmur of running water. A hound bayed off somewhere in the fields. There was no other sound. It was a quiet, beautiful, pastoral scene. But somehow it did not comfort Lenore.|$|E
60|$|When Kit {{was half}} {{way across the}} alameda he stopped and looked about. Dark trees rose against the sky; he <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> {{eucalyptus}} and their thin shadows covered {{the ground with a}} quivering, open pattern. There was a pool of moonlight, and farther on the solid, fan-shaped reflections of palms. Nobody was near him, although he heard voices across the alameda, and he stood for a few moments, thinking, while his heart beat.|$|E
60|$|Then, silently, on {{infinitely}} careful feet, he {{went along}} the passage, feeling {{the wall with}} the extreme tips of his fingers. There was a door. He stood and listened. He could hear two people's breathing. It was not that. He went stealthily forward. There was another door, slightly open. The room was in darkness. Empty. Then there was the bathroom, he <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> soap and the heat. Then at the end another bedroom--one soft breathing. This was she.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{discovery}} of gold at Sutter's Fort, Swift took a party to Bidwell's Bar in 1848 and struck it rich. A fellow miner recalls, [...] "Swift {{was one of the}} best miners I ever knew. It seems as if he <b>could</b> almost <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> gold. He made an immense amount of gold." [...] With his newfound wealth, Swift, his brother William, and his cousin Frank Sears first purchased the ranch they had been working, and later purchased 15,000 acres (61 km²) of Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo's Rancho Petaluma, located near Sears Point.|$|R
60|$|A {{mile and}} a half it must have been to our journey's end. I could hear nothing but the fearful rattle of the ancient hack over the uneven brick paving; I <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> nothing but <b>the</b> drizzle, now further flavored with coal smoke and {{something}} like a mixture of tar and oleander blossoms. All I could see through the streaming windows were two rows of dim houses.|$|R
5000|$|A Nabisco factory on Artesia Boulevard {{was known}} for many years as a Buena Park landmark. The red [...] "Nabisco" [...] sign was visible from the I-5 Freeway, and {{visitors}} to <b>the</b> town <b>could</b> often <b>smell</b> cookies. <b>The</b> factory produced Honey Maid graham crackers, Ritz Crackers, and Nilla Wafers, among other Nabisco products, before shutting down in 2006.|$|R
