40|$|Taiwan {{deregulated}} its wireless {{telecommunication services}} in 1997. Fierce competition followed, and churn management becomes {{a major focus}} of mobile operators to retain subscribers via satisfying their needs under resource constraints. One of the challenges is churner prediction. Through empirical evaluation, this study compares various data mining techniques that can assign a “propensity-to-churn ” score periodically to each and every subscribers of a mobile operator. The results indicate that both decision tree and neural network techniques can deliver accurate churn prediction models by using customer demographic, billing information, contract/service status, <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> records, and <b>service</b> change log...|$|R
40|$|The popularization {{of mobile}} devices {{in the last}} years has led to the {{development}} of an increasing number of services. However the technical limitations of mobile devices call for services that require minimal interactions with the user and adapt their behaviors to the user’s expectations. Context-awareness has proven to facilitate personalization of services by enabling the adaptation of the service to the user’s situation. However, the adaptation is often carried out by using pre-defined rules that only apply to some contexts. In this paper, we present our approach that addresses this limitation in location-aware services by referring to the previous actions of the user. We have developed a metric to calculate the similarity between the current user’s location and the previous ones. Based on this metric, our approach provides a personalized service by determining the service behavior expected by the user in the current location.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, by {{exploiting}} the log of <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> records, {{we present a}} solution procedure of mining user moving patterns in a mobile computing system. Specifically, we propose algorithm LS to accurately determine similar moving sequences from the log of <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> records so as to obtain moving behaviors of users. By exploring the feature of spatial-temporal locality, we develop algorithm TC to group <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> records into clusters. In light {{of the concept of}} regression, we devise algorithm MF to derive moving functions of moving behaviors. Performance of the proposed solution procedure is analyzed and sensitivity analysis on several design parameters is conducted. It is shown by our simulation results that user moving patterns obtained by our solution procedure are of very high quality and in fact very close to real user moving behaviors. ...|$|R
