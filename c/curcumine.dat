40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to find out the curcuminoid content and antioxidant activity of temulawak (Curcuma xanthorriza) chip extracts under specific treatment. This research was started with preparation of temulawak chips. Which were made from 2 treatment of sun drying, those which were convered with black cloth and those without cover. The quantity of three types of know curcuminoids of temulawak chips were analyzed by HPCL after axtraction with 0 %, 5 % and 95 % etanol solvent. Antioxidant activities in the extracts were measured by ferri thiocyanate and thiobarbituric acid methods. The result indicated that drying with black cloth cover showed higher curcuminoid content and antioxidant activity compared with those without black cloth cover, but drying with black cloth cover had no effect on the type of curcuminoids. The antioxidant activity of temulawak chip was highest with the type of curcuminoids being bisdemetoxicurcumine, demetoxicurcumine and <b>curcumine</b> when the temulawak chips were extracted with 95 % ethanol. While the type of curcuminoids were only demetoxicurcumine and <b>curcumine,</b> when temulawak chips were extracted with 0 % and 50 % ethanol...|$|E

40|$|The lack of {{effective}} topical formulations {{for the treatment}} of cutaneous leishmaniasis urges the need to develop new therapeutic options. In addition, the fact that skin immune response has a strong influence on treatment response and lesion resolution requires more in depth studies in order to find new treatment options. In our first work, we prepared, optimized and evaluated a chitosan hydrogel containing a new chemically-synthesized diselenide drug solubilized with cyclodextrins. This diselenide drug showed antileishmanial activity against L. major and we decided to formulate it in a hydrogel because L. major leads to ulcer formation, so the more hydrophilic epidermis would have a higher affinity for a hydrophilic formulation. Chitosan was chosen because of its wound healing properties. Franz cells diffusion studies showed that the diselenide drug could accumulate in the skin dermis and that little amounts would reach systemic circulation. In a L. major infection BALB/c model, the formulation did not lead to infection cure, which could have been {{due to the fact that}} in mice, hyperkeratosis develops upon Leishmania infection, and this could have hindered the permeation of the drug. Also, because the new drug exhibited high hydrogen bonding ability, it may have been retained in the upper skin layer. In the second study, we prepared, optimized and evaluated lecithin-chitosan nanoparticles containing the natural origin drug β-lapachone. β-lapachone showed antileishmanial activity against L. major that was enhanced when it was encapsulated in the nanoparticles. Franz cell skin diffusion studies confirmed that the nanoformulation containing β-lapachone was able to lead to drug accumulation in the dermis. In L. major-infected BALB/c mice, the formulation did not lead to infection cure but it stopped lesion progression. The reduction of the ulceration area, crust, and necrosis of the lesion, as well as the reduction of the neutrophilic infiltrate could be linked to the down-regulation of IL- 1 β and COX- 2. Finally, our aim was to evaluate which strategy could favor infection control through parasite death and modulation of skin microenvironment: (i) the use of dapsone and <b>curcumine,</b> that are antileishmanial and antiinflammatory drugs (double mechanism of action), or the (ii) combination of the leishmanicidal drug paromomycin with biological molecules that have anti- or proinflammatory effects (anti-TNFα or the TLR 3 agonist Poly(I:C), respectively). In vitro studies were carried out using L. major and L. braziliensis strains, as treatment outcome differs between species and L. braziliensis has the potential to cause MCL. Dapsone, <b>curcumine</b> and paromomycin showed antileishmanial activity against both strains. In addition, in a mouse model of Imiquimod®-induced psoriasis, dapsone, <b>curcumine,</b> paromomycin and anti-TNFα showed the ability to penetrate through the skin and anti-inflammatory activity. The efficacy of the formulations was assessed in L. major-infected BALB/c mice. Topical formulations containing dapsone and <b>curcumine</b> were not effective, but both paromomycin plus PIC or anti-TNFα reduced parasite burden in skin, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen, and led to lesion reduction. However, the combination of paromomycin plus anti-TNFα led to reduction of ulceration, necrosis, and crust, and reduced the neutrophilic infiltrate in the infected skin, which could be linked to the reduction in the gene expression of TNFα, IL- 1 β, IL- 17, and CCL 3...|$|E
40|$|Objective 　To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} curcumin pretreatment on the expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP 2) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (MTFA) in rats' cerebral cortex against focal ischemia reperfusion injury. Methods 　Eighty male SD rats weighed 220 g– 300 g were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham-operated group, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) group, <b>curcumine</b> 50 mg/kg+I/R (low dose) group, and <b>curcumine</b> 100 mg/kg+I/R (high dose) group. The common carotid artery, external carotid artery and internal carotid artery {{on the right side}} were exposed in the sham-operated group. Animals of the other groups were subjected to a 2 -hour period of right middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by 24 hours of reperfusion, and then they were sacrificed. Curcumin was administered (ip) in a dose of 50 mg/kg (low dose group) or 100 mg/kg (high dose group) for 5 days, respectively, prior to arterial occlusion. The pathological changes in neurons and their mitochondria in the cerebral cortex supplied by middle cerebral artery were observed with Nissl staining and electron microscope, respectively. The expressions of UCP 2 and MTFA in corresponding cotex were assessed by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Results 　Compared with sham-operated group, animals in I/R group presented edema of neurons in the corresponding cortex, {{reduction in the number of}} Nissl bodies, and swelling of mitochondria with broken, even lysis of cristae. Low dose and high dose of curcumin pretreatment before brain ischemia significantly alleviated the loss of neurons and the damage of mitochondria, accompanied with an increase in the expression of UCP 2 and TFAM (P< 0. 05), and the changes appeared a dose-dependent manner (P< 0. 05). Conclusions 　Curcumin may prevent neurons from focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury by up-regulating UCP 2 and MTFA. Regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis may probably be a potential target of curcumin as a neuroprotective drug...|$|E
40|$|A {{fraction}} of pyrolytic oils (PyO) – obtained by fast pyrolysis of alder (Alnus incana), ash-tree (Fraxinus excelsior) and aspen (Populus tremula) {{in a laboratory}} scale reactor – was precipitated in water. This hydrophobic moiety of PyO is called pyrolytic lignin (PyL). The composition of the volatile monomeric compounds of PyO and the PyL fraction was determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). It {{has been found that}} PyL has a high content of phenolic products (between 75 % and 83 %), which varies depending on the wood species. The antioxidant properties of the PyL fraction were studied and it was demonstrated that the antioxidant activity determined in different tests exceeded the corresponding activity of alkali lignin. The antioxidant properties of PyL are on the same level as those of the widely used antioxidants, such as rutin, trolox, <b>curcumine,</b> and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ). A new method was developed for the extraction of a monomeric phenol fraction (Py-monPh) from PyO by means of the organic solvent methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE).

40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract In this review, {{we focus on}} the role of oxidative stress in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colitis-associated colorectal cancer and discuss free radi-cals and free radical-stimulated pathways as pharmacological targets for anti-IBD drugs. We also suggest novel anti-oxidative agents, which may become effective and less-toxic alternatives in IBD and colitis-associated colorectal cancer treatment. A Medline search was performed to identify rele-vant bibliography using search terms including: ‘free radi-cals, ’ ‘antioxidants, ’ ‘oxidative stress, ’ ‘colon cancer, ’ ‘ulcer-ative colitis, ’ ‘Crohn’s disease, ’ ‘inflammatory bowel dis-ease. ’ Several therapeutics commonly used in IBD treatment, among which are immunosuppressants, corticosteroids and anti-TNF-α antibodies, could also affect the IBD progression by interfering with cellular oxidative stress and cytokine pro-duction. Experimental data shows that these drugs may effec-tively scavenge free radicals, increase anti-oxidative capacity of cells, influence multiple signalling pathways, e. g. MAPK and NF-kB, and inhibit pro-oxidative enzyme and cytokine concentration. However, their anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effectiveness still needs further investigation. A highly specific antioxidative activity may be important for the clinical treatment and relapse of IBD. In the future, a combination of currently used pharmaceutics, together with natural and synthetic anti-oxidative compounds, like lipoic acid or <b>curcumine,</b> could be taken into account in the design of novel anti-IBD therapies...|$|E
