5|$|The Other Hand, {{also known}} as Little Bee, is a 2008 novel by British author Chris <b>Cleave.</b> It is a dual {{narrative}} story about a Nigerian asylum-seeker and a British magazine editor, who meet during the oil conflict in the Niger Delta, and are re-united in England several years later. <b>Cleave,</b> inspired as a university student by his temporary employment in an asylum detention centre, wrote the book {{in an attempt to}} humanise the plight of asylum-seekers in Britain. The novel examines the treatment of refugees by the asylum system, as well as issues of British colonialism, globalization, political violence and personal accountability.|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{different}} trials were examined experimentally to increase a <b>cleaving</b> velocity in thermal stress <b>cleaving.</b> One is a partial cooling by water mist spray on the propagating crack {{surface and the}} other is a preformation of a slightly high-temperature zone by preheating. It is known that when other <b>cleaving</b> conditions are fixed, the <b>cleaving</b> velocity decreases with increase in width of the target object. This characteristic of thermal stress <b>cleaving</b> is often considered as a shortcoming for practical applications. Therefore, improvement of the <b>cleaving</b> efficiency by increasing a <b>cleaving</b> velocity is one of the important issue in the thermal stress <b>cleaving.</b> It was found experimentally that the maximum attainable <b>cleaving</b> velocity was increased from 38 to 55 mm/s when mist cooling was employed in addition to the usual laser beam heating of 10 W magnitude for 31 mm width specimen. On the other hand, the most effective preheat technique realized more than 400 % increase in the <b>cleaving</b> velocity for 62 mm width specimen. The background why these two types of different approaches both contribute to improve the <b>cleaving</b> velocity was discussed based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics...|$|R

5|$|A {{phosphatase}} is {{an enzyme}} that uses water to <b>cleave</b> a phosphoric acid monoester into a phosphate ion and an alcohol. Because a phosphatase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of its substrate, it is a subcategory of hydrolases. Phosphatase enzymes {{are essential to}} many biological functions, because phosphorylation (e.g. by protein kinases) and dephosphorylation (by phosphatases) serve diverse roles in cellular regulation and signaling.|$|E
5|$|After {{integration}} into the RISC, siRNAs base-pair to their target mRNA and <b>cleave</b> it, thereby preventing it from {{being used as a}} translation template. Differently from siRNA, a miRNA-loaded RISC complex scans cytoplasmic mRNAs for potential complementarity. Instead of destructive cleavage (by Ago2), miRNAs rather target the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) regions of mRNAs where they typically bind with imperfect complementarity, thus blocking the access of ribosomes for translation.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, {{arachidonic acid}} may be <b>cleaved</b> from {{phospholipids}} after phospholipase C (PLC) <b>cleaves</b> off the inositol trisphosphate group, yielding diacylglycerol (DAG), which subsequently is <b>cleaved</b> by DAG lipase to yield arachidonic acid.|$|R
40|$|Time of {{the first}} {{cleavage}} {{has been used as}} an indicator to determine developmental rate and quality of embryos in many species. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine effect of time {{of the first}} cleavage on cat embryo development and blastocyst quality. After in vitro fertilization, embryos were observed twice at 27 and 42 hours. Embryos <b>cleaved</b> at 27 hours post-fertilization (pf) were classified as early <b>cleaved</b> embryos and were separated from the remainder which were determined as delayed <b>cleaved</b> embryos (<b>cleaved</b> between 27 and 42 hours). These two groups were separately cultured in the same condition for 7 days to observe embryo developmental and blastocyst formation rates. To evaluate the embryo quality, cells of the blastocyst were classified into inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm cell (TE). The results showed that the percentages of the 8 -cell and morula of the early <b>cleaved</b> embryos and the delayed <b>cleaved</b> embryos were not different (100. 0 vs. 96. 0 % and 97. 1 vs. 92. 0 %, respectively; p> 0. 05), whereas the blastocyst rates of the early <b>cleaved</b> embryos were greater than the delayed <b>cleaved</b> embryos (68. 4 vs 20. 0 %; p< 0. 05). The total and ICM cell numbers of the blastocysts derived from the early <b>cleaved</b> embryos were higher than those of the delayed <b>cleaved</b> embryos (85. 9 vs 71. 6 cells, p< 0. 05). Moreover, the early <b>cleaved</b> embryos had a higher percentage of ICM cells than the delayed <b>cleaved</b> embryos (38. 0 vs 31. 9 %, p< 0. 05). In conclusion, the cat embryos <b>cleaved</b> at early stage likely have the potential to develop to the blastocyst stage wit...|$|R

5|$|Studies on Drosophila serpins {{reveal that}} Serpin-27A {{inhibits}} the Easter protease (the final protease in the Nudel, Gastrulation Defective, Snake and Easter proteolytic cascade) and thus controls dorsoventral patterning. Easter functions to <b>cleave</b> Spätzle (a chemokine-type ligand), {{which results in}} toll-mediated signaling. As well as its central role in embryonic patterning, toll signaling is also important for the innate immune response in insects. Accordingly, serpin-27A also functions to control the insect immune response. In Tenebrio molitor (a large beetle), a protein (SPN93) comprising two discrete tandem serpin domains functions to regulate the toll proteolytic cascade.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{proteasome}} normally produces {{very short}} peptide fragments, {{in some cases}} these products are themselves biologically active and functional molecules. Certain transcription factors regulating the expression of specific genes, including one component of the mammalian complex NF-κB, are synthesized as inactive precursors whose ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation converts them to an active form. Such activity requires the proteasome to <b>cleave</b> the substrate protein internally, rather than processively degrading it from one terminus. It {{has been suggested that}} long loops on these proteins' surfaces serve as the proteasomal substrates and enter the central cavity, while the majority of the protein remains outside. Similar effects have been observed in yeast proteins; this mechanism of selective degradation is known as regulated ubiquitin/proteasome dependent processing (RUP).|$|E
5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which <b>cleave</b> the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E

5|$|As stated above, the exosome complex {{contains}} many proteins with ribonuclease domains. The {{exact nature of}} these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome is primarily a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3' end. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to <b>cleave</b> the phosphodiester bonds - releasing nucleotide diphosphates. The hydrolytic enzymes use water to hydrolyse these bonds - releasing nucleotide monophosphates.|$|E

5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are able}} to recognize or distort the Holliday junction structure. One such class contains junction-resolving enzymes that <b>cleave</b> the junctions, sometimes in a sequence-specific fashion.

40|$|AbstractThis {{investigation}} {{analyzed the}} immunoexpression of FasL, Fas, <b>cleaved</b> caspase- 8, and <b>cleaved</b> caspase- 3 in glioblastomas. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded glioblastoma tissues and control brain tissues from 97 patients {{were analyzed by}} tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry. Patients with glioblastomas that were negative or weakly stained (< 50 % of cells positive) for <b>cleaved</b> caspase- 8 had worse cancer-specific overall survival (median= 8. 5 months) than did patients with tumors that highly expressed <b>cleaved</b> caspase- 8 (median= 11. 7 months; P= 0. 0325), independent of clinical variables. There was no association of other markers with survival, treatment, sex, age, tumor size, and primary site. Among the tumors, there were reasonable to good positive correlations between the expression of FasL and Fas (r= 0. 47) and between Fas and <b>cleaved</b> caspase- 8 (r= 0. 41), and there were poor positive correlations between Fas and <b>cleaved</b> caspase- 3 (r= 0. 26), FasL and <b>cleaved</b> caspase- 8 (r= 0. 22), and <b>cleaved</b> caspase- 8 and - 3 (r= 0. 31). Our results suggest that Fas-Fas-ligand signal transduction could be inhibited, especially at the stage of caspase- 8 activation, thereby establishing a major mechanism for evasion of apoptosis by these tumors. The absence or low expression of <b>cleaved</b> caspase- 8 in the tumors was a negative prognostic indicator for patient survival...|$|R
5|$|The remark {{originates}} from {{an interview}} conducted by journalist Maureen <b>Cleave,</b> who included the statement in a March 1966 {{article for the}} London Evening Standard, which drew no public reaction at the time.

Some tour events experienced disruption and intimidation, including a picketing by the Ku Klux Klan.|$|E
5|$|Unlike hardness, which denotes only {{resistance}} to scratching, diamond's toughness or tenacity is only fair to good. Toughness {{relates to the}} ability to resist breakage from falls or impacts. Because of diamond's perfect and easy cleavage, it is vulnerable to breakage. A diamond will shatter if hit with an ordinary hammer. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 2.0 MPa m1/2, which is good compared to other gemstones, but poor compared to most engineering materials. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its {{resistance to}} breakage. Diamond has a cleavage plane and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. Diamond cutters use this attribute to <b>cleave</b> some stones, prior to faceting.|$|E
5|$|DNA walkers are a {{class of}} nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit {{directional}} motion along a linear track. A large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One strategy is to control {{the motion of the}} walker along the track using control strands that need to be manually added in sequence. Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to <b>cleave</b> the strands and cause the walker to move forward, which has the advantage of running autonomously. A later system could walk upon a two-dimensional surface rather than a linear track, and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo. Additionally, a linear walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA-templated synthesis as the walker advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the walker. The synthetic DNA walkers' function {{is similar to that of}} the proteins dynein and kinesin.|$|E

5|$|The active {{components}} of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) are endonucleases called argonaute proteins, which <b>cleave</b> the target mRNA strand complementary to their bound siRNA. As the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA. However, {{only one of}} the two strands, which is known as the guide strand, binds the argonaute protein and directs gene silencing. The other anti-guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation. Although it was first believed that an ATP-dependent helicase separated these two strands, the process proved to be ATP-independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC. However, an in vitro kinetic analysis of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to unwind and remove the cleaved mRNA strand from the RISC complex after catalysis. The guide strand tends to be the one whose 5' end is less stably paired to its complement, but strand selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation. Instead, the R2D2 protein may serve as the differentiating factor by binding the more-stable 5' end of the passenger strand.|$|E
25|$|This {{strategy}} is adopted by viral genera {{such as the}} Potyviridae and Tymoviridae. The ribosome translates a single protein from the viral genome.
