40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we propose a simple, {{unstructured}} mesh generation technique that is capable of handling the large and complex blade motion that is encountered in certain rotating machines, such as vertical axis wind turbines or <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propellers.</b> The technique is characterised by localised re-meshing and interpolation, so as to keep the mesh generation cost and interpolation error as low as possible...|$|R
50|$|Since 2000 Kim {{has been}} doing {{research}} on the cyclocopter with 4 rotors. In 2012 he held an outdoor flight demonstration of the cyclocopter {{for the first time}} in the world. The cyclocopter is a new VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) air vehicle that employs a unique propulsion system of cycloidal blades to generate the propulsion and lift for a VTOL maneuver. The rotor system consists of several blades rotating about a horizontal axis that is perpendicular to the direction of normal flight. The <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propeller</b> offers powerful thrust levels, and a unique ability to change the direction of the thrust almost instantly.|$|E
50|$|A cyclorotor, {{cycloidal}} rotor, <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propeller</b> or cyclogiro, is a fluid propulsion {{device that}} converts shaft power into {{the acceleration of}} a fluid using a rotating axis perpendicular to the direction of fluid motion. It uses several blades with a spanwise axis parallel to the axis of rotation and perpendicular to the direction of fluid motion. These blades are cyclically pitched twice per revolution to produce force (thrust or lift) in any direction normal to the axis of rotation. Cyclorotors are used for propulsion, lift, and control on air and water vehicles. An aircraft using cyclorotors as {{the primary source of}} lift, propulsion, and control is known as a cyclogyro. The patented application, used on the ships with particular actuation mechanisms both mechanics or hydraulics is named from the name of the German company that produces them: Voith-Schneider cycloidal propellers.|$|E
50|$|Tugboats {{are highly}} maneuverable, and various {{propulsion}} {{systems have been}} developed to increase maneuverability and increase safety. The earliest tugs were fitted with paddle wheels, but these were soon replaced by propeller-driven tugs. Kort nozzles have been added to increase thrust per kW/hp. This was followed by the nozzle-rudder, which omitted the need for a conventional rudder. The <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propeller</b> was developed prior to World War II and was occasionally used in tugs because of its maneuverability. After World War II it was also linked to safety due {{to the development of the}} Voith Water Tractor, a tugboat configuration which could not be pulled over by its tow. In the late 1950s, the Z-drive or (azimuth thruster) was developed. Although sometimes referred to as the Aquamaster or Schottel system, many brands exist: Steerprop, Wärtsilä, Berg Propulsion, etc. These propulsion systems are used on tugboats designed for tasks such as ship docking and marine construction. Conventional propeller/rudder configurations are more efficient for port-to-port towing.|$|E

50|$|The Osprey class {{ships are}} larger than the other Lerici designs: they {{displace}} 918 tons fully loaded, are 57.3 m long, 11 m wide, and with a draught of 2.9 m. The ships are fitted with two diesel motors driving two Voith Schneider Propellers; these <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propellers</b> {{eliminate the need for}} the aft two active rudders. The ships use a Raytheon/Thomson Sintra SQQ-32 VDS sonar for minehunting, and Alliant SLQ-48 remote vehicles for mine disposal. The ships normally carry a crew of 51, including four officers, and are armed with two 12.7 mm machine guns.|$|R
5000|$|In Israel, OptiVector Ltd. has {{conducted}} Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) studies of these rotors in hovering flight using various blade trajectories at 400 rpm and 550 rpm. Thanks to this trajectory optimization, it achieved up to 4 {{times as much}} as the Helicopter's Power Loading. It is noteworthy that limited pitch optimization along the elongated trajectory has already produced almost a doubling of Thrust and Power Loading for the <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propellers</b> operating in water - so pitch optimization along the whole orbit will be tried next for the aerial rotors. It is reasonable to expect further improvements for both rotors and propellers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{non-linear}} mathematical model, for the roll-yaw behaviour of a ship, is used {{to predict}} the prevention of capsize of a small ship. The problem was simulated using the digital package SIMULINK. Simulated responses of the ship with simple hydrodynamic fin stabilisers show that capsize {{could have been prevented}} by this means in waves up to 7 m in height. Active control using a simple full span control flap {{is used to}} show a reduction in roll angle to much greater waves. These results are compared to the use of <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propeller</b> propulsion to provide lateral thrust and hence roll control, which showed that this method can also reduce the roll. In order for successful roll reduction with a <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propeller</b> the response time constant is determined. In this example the roll reduction is greater in the fin example but this ability falls off rapidly with forward speed. Roll control using the <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propeller</b> has the advantage of retaining its’ effectiveness at low or zero speeds. To be fully effective for this ship, the reaction time to generate the side thrust from the roll actuation signal must be less than 13 seconds for the <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propeller</b> to prevent capsize. This would imply the use of the <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propeller</b> for roll control is better suited to larger ships...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the numerical modelling of a <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propeller</b> in freerunning conditions together with its possible applications. The model calibration {{is carried out}} by comparing simulation results with experimental data of an existing cycloidal unit. The achieved results support the main strength of the proposed simulation approach: propeller fluid dynamics is not calculated, avoiding demanding computations that would not allow an effective simulation of the whole propulsion plant. As a case study, the cycloidal propulsors model {{is used for the}} thruster allocation assessment of the Dynamic Positioning (DP) system of a surface vessel, originally equipped with traditional propellers. Then, the steady-state performance analysis of the DP system is carried out in terms of a comparison between the two distinct propulsion configurations...|$|E
50|$|A {{propeller}} {{is a type}} of fan that transmits {{power by}} converting rotational motion into thrust. A pressure difference is produced between the forward and rear surfaces of the airfoil-shaped blade, and a fluid (such as air or water) is accelerated behind the blade. Propeller dynamics, like those of aircraft wings, can be modelled by either or both Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law. A marine propeller of this type is sometimes colloquially known as a screw propeller or screw, however there is a different class of <b>propellers</b> known as <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propellers</b> - they are characterized by the higher propulsive efficiency averaging 0.72 compared to the screw propeller's average of 0.6 and the ability to throw thrust in any direction at any time. Their disadvantages are higher mechanical complexity and higher cost.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cycloidal</b> <b>propellers</b> {{are known}} to be high thrust propulsors. They {{generate}} thrusts by controlling cyclically attack angles of rotating blades. In addition, they have characteristics of omni-directional and instantaneous control capabilities to yield high thrusts from small input power. We have been working to analyze their performances for several years. Experimental tests on thrust and power consumption measurements were performed with a three bladed propulsor, and indoor flight tests were carried out on an airship of 20 meters in length with a pair of these thrusters, and its flight performances were evaluated.

40|$|A {{hydromechanical}} {{theory is}} developed for <b>cycloidal</b> <b>propellers</b> for two limiting {{modes of operation}} wherein U » ΩR and U « ΩR, with U the rectilinear propeller speed (speed of advance) and ΩR the rotational blade speed. A first order theory is developed from {{the basic principles of}} the kinematics and dynamics of fluid motion and proceeds {{from the point of view}} of unsteady hydrofoil theory. Explicit expressions for the instantaneous forces and moments produced by blade motions are presented. On the basis of these results an optimization procedure is carried out which minimizes the energy loss under the constraint of specified mean thrust. Under optimal conditions the propeller is found to possess high Froude efficiencies in both the high and low speed modes of propulsion. This efficiency is defined as the ratio of the average useful work obtained during one cycle of propeller operation to the average power input required to sustain the motion of the propeller during the cycle. </p...|$|R

In this work, cycloidal propulsion system was designed and implemented with sinusoidal low pitch system to investigate the fundamental characteristics of hovering states. Before experimental study, computational analysis was made in commercial CFD tool, CD Adopco/Star-CD. This work gives schematic view of flow field around rotor. And it predicts the load variation on a blade with respect to revolution and the total thrust from cycloidal rotor, at specific condition. CFD analysis also makes it possible to check the camber effect. The propulsion system was built up with sinusoidal low pitch control mechanism.
