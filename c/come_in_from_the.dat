5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told him she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E
5|$|Route22 {{continues}} heading northeast along {{a narrow}} strip of land between the East Branch and Bog Brook reservoirs. It then resumes its northward heading, following a much straighter course than it had up to this point, on two lanes through wooded areas {{of the town of}} Patterson, where two local state highways, NY312 and 164, <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west. The highway gradually expands to three and sometimes four lanes as it passes through built-up areas of strip development. Shortly after intersecting a third state highway, NY311, and passing another strip plaza, NY22 crosses into Dutchess County.|$|E
25|$|The Abruzzo {{region has}} the Apennines running along its western border and {{includes}} Corno Grande, {{the highest point}} on mainland Italy. The mountain range serves as a tempering influence on the climate, blocking many storms that <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west. However, this does leave the area prone to storm systems originating from the east, which are blocked in their westward progression by the mountains, causing high levels of precipitation to fall on the vineyards, as happened during several rain soaked vintages of the late 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Alturas {{is served}} by U.S. Route 395 and California State Route 299. U.S. 395 <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south <b>from</b> Susanville and Reno. State Route 299 <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west <b>from</b> Redding. Both {{highways}} merge in Alturas and {{head out of the}} city as a concurrency northeast toward Lakeview, Oregon and Cedarville, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Canterbury {{came into}} the {{competition}} first on the points table while Northland <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bottom four.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{personnel}} for the dam were housed at {{a temporary}} camp that dwarfed {{the nearby town}} of Moran, Wyoming. Supplies <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Grassy Lake Road north of the park, which runs west into Idaho to meet the nearest railhead at Ashton, Idaho.|$|R
25|$|At Fitzgerald's Ford, the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry, {{supported}} by the 5th North Carolina Cavalry, were thrown back as the 5th North Carolina {{had been in the}} morning. Only the 1st North Carolina Cavalry could keep a foothold across the ford. Rooney Lee ordered Brigadier General Richard L. T. Beale's Virginia cavalry brigade to attack across the creek and <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left. Both Beale's and Barringer's cavalry brigades now rushed across Smith's line, forcing the Union force to retreat into an open field and quickly withdraw.|$|E
25|$|The {{first trial}} lasted {{three weeks and}} {{took place at the}} Dunedin High Court in May 1995. The Crown put forward that Bain shot to death his mother, two sisters and brother in {{undetermined}} order before going on his morning paper run. On his return he waited for his father to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> caravan and go into the lounge to pray and then shot him from behind the computer alcove curtain, typed the message on the computer, arranged the scene {{to make it look like}} a suicide, and called 111. The defence submitted that Robin Bain killed the other family members, typed the message and shot himself while David was out on his paper round.|$|E
25|$|But Charles {{was in no}} case {{to resume}} his {{northern}} march. Fairfax and the New Model, after reducing Bridgwater, had turned back to clear away the Dorsetshire Clubmen and to besiege Sherborne Castle. On the completion of this task, it had been decided to besiege Bristol. On 23 August 1645, while the King's army was still in Huntingdon, and Goring was trying to raise a new army to replace {{the one he had}} lost at Langport and Bridgwater, the city was invested. In these urgent circumstances Charles left Oxford for the west only a day or two after he had <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Association raid. Calculating that Rupert could hold out longest, he first moved to the relief of Worcester.|$|E
25|$|In {{the centre}} of Black Patch Park, Boundary Brook, which for centuries marked a {{boundary}} between Staffordshire and Warwickshire, meets Hockley Brook, which once separated the country villages of Handsworth and Smethwick. Boundary Brook enters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> South, while Hockley Brook <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> West under Woodburn Road.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2011-12 season, Lens' jersey number was changed to number 11, which was free since the departure of Nordin Amrabat to Kayserispor in January 2011. On 6 November 2011, Lens <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bench against Heracles and scored a hat-trick, his first for the club.|$|R
25|$|A short yellow-blazed spur <b>from</b> <b>the</b> steep Becker Hollow Trail <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{north as}} well, {{but it is}} {{infrequently}} used. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> east, at Stony Clove Notch, the Devil's Path climbs to the junction with another short trail, the Hunter Mountain Trail, which in turn climbs to the junction with the Spruceton and Becker Hollow trails at the pre-1953 tower site.|$|R
25|$|In the winter, from November to February, {{there are}} light rains called equipatas ("horse hoofs", {{named after the}} sound the rain makes). These rains <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north from the {{southern}} extensions of frontal storms that originate in the northern Pacific Ocean. These end by March or April when the fronts are no longer strong enough to reach this far south. They end even earlier in the extreme south of the state as the storm systems retreat, with the dry season lasting eight or nine months {{in this part of}} the state. In the north these rains support a wide variety of spring annuals and wildflowers, but the water they supply in the south of the state is still important to help replenish wells.|$|E
25|$|Grüner Veltliner is {{most closely}} {{associated}} with Austria where {{it is the most}} widely planted grape variety in the country, covering almost a third of all Austrian vineyards, with 17,034 hectares (42,092 acres) in cultivation in 2012. The grape is authorized in five Districtus Austriae Controllatus (DAC) regions—the Weinviertel where it is the only permitted grape variety; Leithaberg where it can be made as a varietal or blended with Pinot blanc, Chardonnay and Neuburger; Traisental, Kremstal and Kamptal where it is planted with Riesling. The grape is also found in the Donauland (now known as the Wagram region) and in the Wachau region of Lower Austria. Along the Danube river warm air currents <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pannonian Basin to the east and blow westward, warming the vines. This area tends to produce more full bodied wines with peach flavor notes.|$|E
25|$|The Follo Line {{is under}} {{construction}} and is scheduled for completion in 2021. It will allow trains to run directly from Ski to Oslo in 11 minutes, down from 23 minutes today. The National Rail Administration has expressed desires to cut the travel time from Mysen to Oslo to 45 minutes. Removal of less used stations, better signaling and the Follo Line are {{the means by which}} they hope to achieve this. Critical for this is to reroute the access from the Eastern Line in to Ski Station. With the current layout, they <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east and as such cannot access the new line without crossing over all the tracks. To avoid this, a new connection needs to be built with the Eastern Line leaving Ski Station to the south, the one track flying over Western Line and then following a new route to a point around Kråkstad Station.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{an excess}} of one {{stereoisomer}} can be observed, as the leaving group can remain in proximity to the carbocation intermediate {{for a short time}} and block nucleophilic attack. [...] This stands in contrast to the SN2 mechanism, which is a stereospecific mechanism where stereochemistry is always inverted as <b>the</b> nucleophile <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear side of the leaving group.|$|R
50|$|At 00:30, 20 March 1967, the Viet Cong {{resumed their}} attack, hitting Fire Support Base 20 with mortar rounds, rifle grenades, rockets, and {{recoilless}} rifle fire. This {{was the start}} of the main phase of the battle. Festa's track was hit, wounding his sergeant, as fire <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west. Alcala requested artillery support <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battalion he was securing and further away in Lai Khe.|$|R
30|$|This {{modelling}} seems unrealistic, as in {{real life}} <b>the</b> air <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> every direction and the material is air permeable. However, when there are slits in the water proof garments, {{the effect of the}} slit is much bigger than the material itself. As a first step to investigate the direction of air flow that <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hem line, it could be more useful to simplify the model as much as possible.|$|R
25|$|The {{amount of}} YAN needed {{will depend on}} what the winemaker's goals are for fermentation, {{particularly}} whether or not wild fermentation is desired or if the wine will be fully fermented to dryness. The state of the grapes and the conditions of fermentation will influence the amount of nitrogen needed. Fruit that is damaged, moldy or botrytis infected will usually be more depleted of nitrogen (as well as other vitamin resources) when they <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vineyard than clean, intact grapes. This depletion can be further exacerbated by over clarification of the must and high sugar content. Wines fermented at higher temperatures tend to progress at a faster rate, requiring more nitrogen than longer, cooler fermentation. Also the amount of oxygen exposure will influence the rate of nitrogen uptake by the yeast with wine fermented in complete anaerobic conditions (such as many white wines in stainless steel tanks) requiring less nitrogen than wines fermented in barrels or open top fermentors.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon's {{strategy}} for early 1809 {{called for an}} invasion of Portugal by three columns. He ordered Marshal Nicolas Soult's 20,000 troops to advance from the north, General of Division Pierre Belon Lapisse's 9,000 men to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northeast, and Marshal Claude Victor's soldiers to march from the east. Napoleon's plan called for Soult to capture Porto (Oporto) by 5 February 1809. From there, Soult was supposed to march to Lisbon and occupy it by the 16th of the same month. Meanwhile, Lapisse was directed to move from Salamanca to seize Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida, Portugal as soon as Soult's II Corps got to Porto. Victor was ordered to be at Mérida by this time. He was instructed to detach a column from there to advance on Lisbon. The emperor expected that Soult, Lapisse, and Victor would readily {{be able to send}} messengers to each other, and easily coordinate their operations. This assumption ignored the likelihood that Portuguese and Spanish guerillas would prevent Soult's dispatches from reaching his colleagues.|$|E
25|$|The two mounted {{divisions}} {{were now}} in position, watching for the expected Ottoman reinforcements. By between 11:00 and 11:35, {{more or less}} all mounted troops were under fire. This fire came from shells launched from Gaza, or from German or Ottoman planes flying over Beit Durdis, {{as well as a}} long range gun, while another gun also fired on the mounted units. The battery of the 5th Mounted Brigade fired on some small groups of Ottoman infantry, but the hostile long range gun accurately returned fire, causing this battery to change position. Very little fighting had yet taken place, so far as the mounted units were concerned, and the infantry attack had not made much progress. However, news was beginning to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> overwatching Desert Column patrols, reporting movements from the direction of Huj and the Beersheba railway line, and columns of dust in the direction of Tel esh Sharia, all indicating large scale Ottoman Army movements in progress. However, by 12:00 Chetwode commanding Desert Column, had not yet received any reports of Ottoman reinforcements moving towards Gaza, and he sent a message to Chauvel commanding the Anzac Mounted Division and Hodgson commanding the Imperial Mounted Division, to prepare to send a brigade each to assist the infantry attack on Gaza.|$|E
2500|$|Reports <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{outskirts}} of the city that the North Vietnamese were moving. At 10:48a.m., Martin relayed to Kissinger his desire to activate [...] "the FREQUENT WIND" [...] evacuation plan; Kissinger gave the order three minutes later. The American radio station began regular play of Irving Berlin's [...] "White Christmas," [...] the signal for American personnel to move immediately to the evacuation points.|$|R
2500|$|Each {{air mass}} type brings in {{different}} temperature and moisture properties. The continental polar air mass brings in cold and dry air from central Canada, traveling south across the region. The continental tropical air mass <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, bringing in hot and dry air while moving north. The maritime tropical air mass comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southwest United States and Northern Mexico, and {{it tends to}} bring in warm and moist air, but sometimes the air that <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> is dry. The last air mass that affects this ecoregion is the maritime polar air mass. It <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean and moves east over the mountain regions. It brings in cool moist air that changes to warm dry air after moving over the mountains. These air masses cause the seasons to be very extreme and drastic. The winter time brings harsh and varied weather. The midsummer months bring in warm moist and dry air, depending on the area within the region and what air masses affect those areas.|$|R
5|$|The Cardinals scored one run in {{both the}} second and third innings on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Mike Matheny to score Jim Edmonds and a home run to right field by Walker, respectively. However, {{in the bottom of the}} third, the Red Sox scored three runs after seven consecutive batters reached base, giving them a five-run lead. Dan Haren <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cardinals' bullpen to replace Williams during the inning.|$|R
500|$|The line then runs south-west, past Bergerfoss and Kistefoss, before {{reaching}} Viul. There, {{there is a}} branch to a lumber mill. After Viul, the line runs through two tunnels, [...] long. At Hval, located [...] from Roa, there was formerly a spur to a military camp. The line then runs over a [...] bridge over Randselva before passing Hønen and a spur at Hønen and to a Goman bakery. Just {{before reaching}} Hønefoss Station, the line runs on a [...] bridge over Begna. At Hønefoss, the Roa–Hønefoss Line and the Randsfjord Line <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east while the Randsfjord Line and the Bergen Line continue to the west. Hønefoss is [...] from Oslo via Roa and [...] via Drammen.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{steadily}} improved {{during their}} time in Hamburg, and this was noticed by other musicians who were there at the time. McCartney recalled, [...] "We got better and better and other groups started coming to watch us. The accolade of accolades was when Sheridan would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Top Ten (the big club where we aspired to go) or when Rory Storm or Ringo [...] would hang around to watch us. ‘What'd I Say’ was always the one that really got them." [...] The song was often played by the group, once being played for 90 minutes non-stop, with group members walking off stage to wash and drink before returning. Sutcliffe {{wrote a letter to}} his mother saying, [...] "We have improved a thousand-fold since our arrival and Allan Williams, who is here at the moment, tells us that there is no group in Liverpool to touch us." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1948 Horne {{appeared}} with Murdoch in six episodes of the BBC Television comedy series Kaleidoscope. In June that year he and Murdoch again appeared {{on television in}} a one-off sitcom, At Home, which they wrote. The following year Horne began his connection with Twenty Questions, an association that lasted, on-and-off, for 20 years. By the fourth series of Much-Binding in 1950, the listener figures had declined to a level that concerned the BBC and they decided against a fifth series. Rather than {{wait to see what}} other offers of work would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Corporation, Horne and Murdoch signed the comedy to a 35-programme series on Radio Luxembourg between October 1950 and June 1951. The programme was poorly received on the commercial channel: Murdoch observed that [...] "it wasn't really a great success—even my mother said it was rotten, and she was my greatest fan". After one series, the show returned to the BBC in 1951–52, although renamed as Over to You. Murdoch and Horne again appeared together, in April 1952, on Desert Island Discs.|$|E
2500|$|Within a few months, Nicaragua was {{invaded by}} several Spanish forces, each {{led by a}} conquistador. [...] González Dávila was {{authorized}} by royal decree, and <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean coast of Honduras. Francisco Hernández de Córdoba at the command of the governor of Panama approached from [...] Costa Rica. Pedro de Alvarado and Cristóbal de Olid at the command of Hernán Cortés, came from Guatemala through San Salvador and Honduras.|$|R
50|$|During Season 3, she {{and fellow}} detectives Stanley Bolander and Beau Felton are shot {{while trying to}} serve an arrest warrant on a suspect. Howard is struck in the heart, but {{eventually}} makes a full recovery and returns to work. Her family <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coast to visit her in the hospital; her father is especially concerned over how little information the doctors are willing to share.|$|R
25|$|In {{the time}} of the Ukrainian Directorate government, with its {{dictator}} Symon Petlura, the city had periods of uncertain power. At times the anarchists of Nestor Makhno held the city, and at others Denikin's Volunteer Army. Military operations of the Red Army, which <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> North, captured the city in 1919, and despite attempts by Russian General Wrangel in 1920, he was unable to reach Yekaterinoslav. The War ended the following year.|$|R
2500|$|Eidanger {{is located}} [...] from Oslo West Station and at an {{elevation}} of [...] above mean sea level. The station is aligned such that the Bratsberg Line comes in from {{the west and the}} Vestfold and Brevik Line <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east. Since the closing a passing loop remains at the station.|$|E
2500|$|The duo's {{third album}} <b>Come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rain (US #18, 1977) {{produced}} three singles: [...] "Can't Stop Dancing" [...] (US #13), {{the title track}} (US #61), and [...] "Circles", which did not chart. A Records later released a Greatest Hits album (1977) which peaked at #55 on the US Top 200.|$|E
2500|$|Lewes, {{from its}} inception, {{has been an}} {{important}} transport hub. Its site as a bridging point was probably originally a ford: today the main routes avoid the town centre. The A27 trunk road [...] taking traffic along the south coast between Eastbourne and Southampton passes to the south of the town. The A26 from Maidstone to Newhaven; and the A275 (the London road) both <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north. The Brighton & Hove bus company and Compass Travel serve the town. The bus station was closed for a while but reopened in late 2008.|$|E
