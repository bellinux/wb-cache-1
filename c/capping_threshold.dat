40|$|Effective energy {{management}} and control is an important and urgent issue in the emerging and developing countries, so as to achieve their sustainable growth, because of poor quality of power supply by their electric power companies. In order {{to come up with}} the frequent electric power outage by the power company, most of buildings in developing and emerging countries install a power generator. Although because of poor control system in the premises, utilization factor of output capability of power generators is typically low except at peak periods. To improve the utilization factor of power generator, we propose a system, which can manage power segments in the building using SCB (Smart Circuit Breaker). SCBs are connected by wireless technologies with battery backup, and set their power capping based on the indication issued by central manager. The central manager computes power <b>capping</b> <b>threshold</b> of each SCB using the proposed algorithm, in real-time fashion. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can optimize the required capacity of the local power generator and that we need a feedback-looped adaptive threshold calculation algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The {{system of}} direct {{payments}} in the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is being criticised {{with respect to}} the level, unequal distribution and allocation effects on production. Besides the decoupling of direct payments a modulation and a partial transmission to the second pillar of CAP are proposed. Modulation on a voluntary basis was already introduced in Agenda 2000. In its Mid-term Review of the Agenda the Commission proposes an obligatory dynamic modulation scheme including the capping of direct payments beyond a threshold of 300 000 â‚¬. Possible impacts of the Commission's proposal are assessed with simulations based on farm accounting data of EU-FADN. Distribution effects between farm sizes and member states are unveiled. Alternate options with regard to capping and progressive reductions of direct payments are analysed. Due to the different distribution of direct payments, farms of EU Member states will be affected differently by the proposal of the Commission: The franchise of 5 000 â‚¬ will exempt from modulation about tw -thirds of farms being represented by FADN respectively 15 % of the premium volume. About 80 % of the volume are subject to proportional reductions and 5 % fall off due to capping. More than four fifths of the capping affects Eastern Germany alone. The capping measurement leads to large distributional effects between farm sizes and between member states: In the first step of the dynamic modulation, premia beyond the franchise are reduced by 3 % while they are totally taken away beyond the <b>capping</b> <b>threshold.</b> Direct payments to large farms in Eastern Germany would be reduced by more than half. Due to drastic income shortfalls farm adaptations by splitting-up the farm enterprises or reducing the number of hired workers would be induced. An alternate scheme of modulation based on a progressive reduction of direct payments has been proposed. Elements of this system are a franchise, dynamic progressive reductions of direct payments within a progressive zone and proportional premia reductions beyond the upper limit of the progressive zone. There is no capping and with regard to administration purposes no other factors than the level of direct payments are included. With the determination of a few parameters â€” the franchise, the progression zone and the minimum and maximum rates of reduction â€” the system can be handled flexibly in view of social and budgetary objectives. Compared to the Commission's proposal farms entitled to less than 100 000 â‚¬ of direct payments would forfeit less money under the progressive reductions system. Farms entitled to 100 000 to 300 000 â‚¬ of direct payments would lose moderately more. Among the large farms however, premia reductions would be distributed more evenly and never exceed the maximum rate of e. g. 35 % while by the capping as proposed by the Commission affected farms could lose much more with the average loss increasing from 35 to 42 % of original entitlements. midterm-review, modulation, farm accounting data network, direct payments, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTrimethyltin (TMT) is an {{occupational}} {{and environmental health}} hazard behaving as a potent neurotoxin known to affect {{the central nervous system}} as well as the peripheral auditory system. However, the mechanisms underlying TMT-induced ototoxicity are poorly understood. To elucidate the effects of TMT on the cochlea, a single injection of 4 or 8  mg/kg TMT was administered intraperitoneally to adult rats. The compound action potential (<b>CAP)</b> <b>threshold</b> was used to assess the functional status of the cochlea and histological techniques were used to assess the condition of the hair cells and auditory nerve fibers. TMT at 4  mg/kg produced a temporary <b>CAP</b> <b>threshold</b> elevation of 25 – 60  dB that recovered by 28  d post-treatment. Although there was no hair cell loss with the 4  mg/kg dose, there was a noticeable loss of auditory nerve fibers particularly beneath the inner hair cells. TMT at 8  mg/kg produced a large permanent <b>CAP</b> <b>threshold</b> shift that was greatest at the high frequencies. The <b>CAP</b> <b>threshold</b> shift was associated with the loss of outer hair cells and inner hair cells in the basal, high-frequency region of the cochlea, considerable loss of auditory nerve fibers and a significant loss of spiral ganglion neurons in the basal turn. Spiral ganglion neurons showed evidence of soma shrinkage and nuclear condensation and fragmentation, morphological features of apoptotic cell death. TMT-induced damage was greatest in the high-frequency, basal region of the cochlea and the nerve fibers beneath the inner hair cells were the most vulnerable structures...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} {{methods to}} measure sound-induced motions {{in a live}} mammalian cochlea using a laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV). We measured the basilar membrane (BM) in the Mongolian gerbil {{at a distance of}} roughly 1. 5 mm from the extreme base and found a best frequency (BF) of roughly 35 kHz. We chose the base to gain access through the round window membrane (RWM) to minimize the need for invasive surgery. Post-mortem measurements showed a 20 dB drop in sensitivity as well as a half-octave drop in BF. The post-mortem phase led the in vivo phase below the BF and lagged the in vivo phase above the BF. These features of the post-mortem response agree with those seen by Overstreet [10] in the base of the gerbil cochlea. To look for evidence of radial modes in the BM, we measured points along the radius of the BM both in vivo and post-mortem. In the in vivo case, we found slightly sharper tuning {{in the center of the}} BM than on the edge but similar phase excursions. In the post-mortem case, we found similar bandwidths and phase excursions along the radius of the BM. Since in vivo measurements along the radius of the BM were only collected in one animal, we cannot yet conclude that there are multiple radial modes in the gerbil BM. In addition, our in vivo preparation was relatively insensitive as evidenced by compound action potential (<b>CAP)</b> <b>thresholds</b> greater than 80 dB SPL in the region of interest. (cont.) We identified the removal of the RWM as the cause for elevated <b>CAP</b> <b>thresholds</b> by comparing the <b>CAP</b> <b>thresholds</b> before and after removing the RWM to drop beads on the BM as essential reflective targets. Previous studies also suggest that large <b>CAP</b> <b>threshold</b> increases are common in the gerbil base ([10], [6]). Similar techniques have led to greater success in larger mammals; however, we hope to apply the lessons learned from measuring the in vivo gerbil cochlea to mice, the only species that would allow us to determine the micromechanical changes underlying genetic hearing disorders. by Shirin Farrahi.

In addition to its well-known action on estrogen receptors it is also known to acutely block chloride channels that participate in cell volume regulation. Tamoxifen’s role in preventing cochlear outer hair cell (OHC) swelling in vitro suggested that OHC swelling noted following noise exposure could potentially be a therapeutic target for Tamoxifen in its role as a chloride channel blocker to help prevent noise induced hearing loss. To investigate this possiblity, the effects of exposure to Tamoxifen on physiologic measures of cochlear function in the presence and absence of subsequent noise exposure were studied. Male Mongolian gerbils (2 – 4 months old) were randomly assigned to different groups. Tamoxifen at ~ 10 mg/kg was administered to one of the groups. Five hours later they were exposed to a one-third octave band of noise centered at 8 kHz in a sound isolation chamber for 30 minutes at 108 dB SPL.

40|$|Atrophy of the {{stria vascularis}} and spiral {{ligament}} and an associated {{decrease in the}} endocochlear potential (EP) are significant factors in age-related hearing loss (presbyacusis). To model this EP decrease, furosemide was delivered into the round-window niche of young adult gerbils by osmotic pump for seven days, chronically reducing the EP by 30 – 40 mV. Compound action potential (<b>CAP)</b> <b>thresholds</b> were correspondingly reduced by 30 – 40 dB SPL at high frequencies. Two weeks after withdrawal of furosemide, the treated ears showed an EP recovery of up to 20 – 30 mV along with a similar recovery of <b>CAP</b> <b>thresholds.</b> The influence of cell division on furosemide-induced and age-related decline of the EP was examined using a mitotic tracer, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Cell proliferation was examined in three groups: young control, furosemide-treated, and aged cochleas. Sections immunostained for BrdU were bleached with H 2 O 2 to eliminate ambiguities with melanin pigment in the inner ear. Cell types positively labeled for BrdU in all three groups included Schwann cells in Rosenthal's canal; glial cells in the osseous spiral lamina; fibrocytes in the limbus, sacculus, and spiral ligament (SL); epithelial cells in Reissner's and round-window membranes; intermediate cells in the stria vascularis; and vascular endothelial cells. Quantitative analysis showed that {{the mean number of}} BrdU-positive (BrdU+) intermediate cells in the stria did not differ significantly among the three groups. In contrast, there was a significant increase of BrdU + fibrocytes in the SL of furosemide-treated animals as compared to the young control group. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in labeled fibrocytes in the aged versus the young ears, particularly among the type II and type IV subtypes. The results suggest that the increased fibrocyte turnover in the SL after furosemide treatment {{may be related to the}} recovery of EP and <b>CAP</b> <b>thresholds,</b> supporting the hypothesis that fibrocyte proliferation may be essential for maintaining the EP and cochlear function in normal and damaged cochleas. Moreover, the decreased turnover of SL fibrocytes with age may be a contributing factor underlying the lateral wall pathology and consequent EP loss that often accompanies presbyacusis...|$|R

40|$|In animal {{models of}} deafness, {{administration}} of an aminoglycoside {{in combination with}} a loop diuretic is often applied to produce a rapid loss of cochlear hair cells. However, {{the extent to which}} surviving hair cells remain functional after such a deafening procedure varies. In a longitudinal electrocochleographical study, we investigated the variability of cochlear function between and within guinea pigs after combined administration of kanamycin and furosemide. Concurrently, histological data were obtained at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after deafening treatment. The main measures in our study were compound action potential (<b>CAP)</b> <b>thresholds,</b> percentage of surviving hair cells and packing density of spiral ganglion cells (SGCs). One day after deafening treatment, we found threshold shifts widely varying among animals from 0 to 100 dB. The variability decreased after 2 days, and in 18 out of 20 animals threshold shifts greater than 55 dB were found 4 - 7 days after deafening. Remarkably, in the majority of animals, thresholds decreased by up to 25 dB after 7 days indicating functional recovery. As expected, final thresholds were negatively correlated to the percentage of surviving hair cells. Notably, the percentage of surviving hair cells might be predicted on the basis of thresholds observed one day after deafening. SGC packing density, which rapidly decreased with the period after deafening treatment and correlated to the percentage of surviving inner hair cells, was not a determining factor for the <b>CAP</b> <b>thresholds...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a model of acute noise induced hearing loss that focused on excitotoxic damage, in the albino guinea pig. The model used {{moderate}} 12 % hypoxia in combination with 100 dB SPL bandpass 5 - 20 kHz noise. The model employed gross electrophysiological measures as auditory endpoints, comprising the brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) the cochlear compound action potential (CAP), and the ensemble spontaneous or driven cochlear nerve activity (ESAC/EDAC) derived from the Fast Fourier Transform of gross cochlear nerve (CN) activity. Preliminary model development was carried out using BAER. These experiments established an optimal sedation and hypoxia regimen, demonstrating that systemic physiological stability was maintained with this regime. Significant changes in the BAER were seen within the first 15 minutes of exposure with noise and noise/hypoxia. There was significant synergy between noise and hypoxia, but hypoxia alone did not result in any significant changes in BAER. More detailed development of the model utilised frequency specific <b>CAP</b> <b>threshold,</b> amplitude and latency measurements at 8, 16, 24 and 30 kHz. Significant frequency dependent changes were seen in all these parameters that again revealed synergy between acute noise and hypoxia. These results inferred excitotoxic damage at the afferent nerve synapse, and damage due to metabolic overload further downstream in the afferent nerve fibre. The ESAC/EDAC results also supported this. The above model was then used to show that a single oral dose (20 mg/kg) of lamotrigine (LTG) provided cochleoprotection against acute noise. LTG rapidly penetrated the inner ear and there was marginal evidence of a tonotopic effect on <b>CAP</b> <b>threshold</b> and amplitude, but no effect on ESAC. LTG also ameliorated noise induced threshold shifts at 8 and 16 kHz by approximately 10 dB. The ED AC signal during noise exposure was also significantly reduced.

40|$|Electrically evoked otoacoustic {{emissions}} (EEOAEs) are sounds {{measured in}} the ear canal when alternating current (AC) stimulation is passed into the cochlea. These sounds are attributed to the motile responses of outer hair cells (OHCs). The EEOAE has characteristic amplitude, phase, and fine structure. Multicomponent analysis of the EEOAE shows short (SDC) and long delay components (LDC) that are thought to originate from OHCs near the AC stimulating site and from OHCs at more remote locations, respectively. We measured the effects of various loud noise exposures on the EEOAE and the cochlear whole-nerve action potential (CAP) in animals chronically implanted with a scala tympani electrode.

40|$|Thesis {{presented}} in partial fulfilment {{of the requirements}} of the degree of Master of Clinical Audiology / Doctor of Philosophy of The University of Western AustraliaThe cochlea presumably possesses a number of regulatory mechanisms to maintain cochlear sensitivity in the face of disturbances to its function. Evidence for such mechanisms {{can be found in the}} time-course of the recovery of <b>CAP</b> <b>thresholds</b> during experimental manipulations, and in observations of slow oscillations in cochlear micromechanics following exposure to low-frequency tones (the “bounce phenomenon”) and other perturbations. To increase our understanding of the these oscillatory processes within the cochlea, and OHCs in particular, investigations into cochlear regulation were carried out using a combination of mathematical modelling of the ionic and mechanical interactions likely to exist within the OHCs, and electrophysiological experiments conducted in guinea pigs. The electrophysiological experiments consisted of electrocochleographic recordings and, in some cases, measurement of otoacoustic emissions, during a variety of experimental perturbations, including the application of force to the cochlear wall, exposure to very-low-frequency tones, injection of direct current into scala tympani, and intracochlear perfusions of artificial perilymph containing altered concentrations of potassium, sodium, and sucrose. To obtain a panoramic view of cochlear regulation under these conditions, software was written to enable the interleaved and near-simultaneous measurement of multiple indicators of cochlear function, including the compound action potential (<b>CAP)</b> <b>threshold,</b> amplitude and waveshape at multiple frequencies, the OHC transfer curves derived from low-frequency cochlear microphonic (CM) waveforms, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), the spectrum of the round-window neural noise (SNN), and the endocochlear potential (EP). The mathematical model takes into account the known electrical properties of OHC, and includes the effect of fast and slow-motility of the cell body on transducer operating point and apical conductance. Central to the operation of the model is a putative intracellular 2 nd-messenger system based on cytosolic calcium, which is involved in regulation of i) the operating point of OHC MET channels via slow motility and axial stiffness; ii) the permeability of the basolateral wall to potassium (via calcium-sensitive potassium channels); and iii) the cytosolic concentration of calcium itself, via modulation of its own sequestration into (and release from) intracellular storage organelles, and extrusion from the cell. The model was constructed in a manner which allowed simulation of different cochlear perturbations, and the comparison of results from these simulations to experimental data. The mathematical model we have developed provided a physiologically-plausible and internally-consistent explanation for the time-courses of the cochlear changes observed during a number of different perturbations. We show that much of the oscillatory behaviour within the cochlea is consistent with underlying oscillations in cytosolic calcium concentration. We conclude that a number of the discrepancies between the simulation results and the experimental data can be resolved if the cytosolic calcium functions as two distinct pools: one which controls basolateral permeability and one which controls slow motility.

Thresholds and latencies of the CAP, in response to tone bursts (2 - 40 kHz), were measured when the animal was awake and unrestrained, and again after several hours of anesthesia. The CAP remained unchanged {{with a variety of}} common anesthetics when precise control of round window temperature was maintained. However, when anesthesia was accompanied by several hours of slight cochlear cooling, thresholds were elevated for CAPs evoked by frequencies above 24 kHz and latencies were increased for CAPs evoked by all frequencies tested.

Guinea pigs were tested while still anesthetized {{at the conclusion of the}} implantation procedure, and then again several days later while awake. Thresholds and latencies were unchanged.

However, when small portions of the bulla were broken away with forceps, the CAP in response to high-frequency tone bursts immediately showed elevated thresholds. This alteration of the CAP was clearly different from that produced by lowered temperature, since the latencies at threshold were significantly decreased...|$|R
40|$|Two inbred mouse strains, CBA/J and CBA/CaJ, {{have been}} used nearly interchangeably as ‘good hearing’ {{standards}} for research in hearing and deafness. We recently reported, however, that these two strains diverge after 1  year of age, such that CBA/CaJ mice show more rapid elevation of compound action potential (<b>CAP)</b> <b>thresholds</b> at high frequencies (Ohlemiller, Brain Res. 1277 : 70 – 83, 2009). One contributor is progressive decline in endocochlear potential (EP) that appears only in CBA/CaJ. Here, we explore the cellular bases of threshold and EP disparities in old CBA/J and CBA/CaJ mice. Among the major findings, both strains exhibit a characteristic age (∼ 18  months in CBA/J and 24  months in CBA/CaJ) when females overtake males in sensitivity decline. Strain differences in progression of hearing loss are not due to greater hair cell loss in CBA/CaJ, but instead appear to reflect greater neuronal loss, plus more pronounced changes in the lateral wall, leading to EP decline. While {{both male and female}} CBA/CaJ show these pathologies, they are more pronounced in females. A novel feature that differed sharply by strain was moderate loss of outer sulcus cells (or ‘root’ cells) in spiral ligament of the upper basal turn in old CBA/CaJ mice, giving rise to deep indentations and void spaces in the ligament. We conclude that CBA/CaJ mice differ both quantitatively and qualitatively from CBA/J in age-related cochlear pathology, and model different types of presbycusis...|$|R
40|$|The {{deafness}} (dn) and Beethoven (Bth) mutant mice are {{models for}} profound congenital deafness (DFNB 7 /B 11) and progressive hearing loss (DFNA 36), respectively, caused by recessive and dominant mutations of transmembrane cochlear-expressed gene 1 (TMC 1), which encodes a transmembrane protein of unknown function. In the mouse cochlea Tmc 1 {{is expressed in}} both outer (OHCs) and inner (IHCs) hair cells from early stages of development. Immature hair cells of mutant mice seem normal in appearance and biophysical properties. From around P 8 for OHCs and P 12 for IHCs, mutants fail to acquire (dn/dn) or show reduced expression (Bth/Bth and, {{to a lesser extent}} Bth/+) of the K+ currents which contribute to their normal functional maturation (the BK-type current IK,f in IHCs, and the delayed rectifier IK,n in both cell types). Moreover, the exocytotic machinery in mutant IHCs does not develop normally as judged by the persistence of immature features of the Ca 2 + current and exocytosis into adulthood. Mutant mice exhibited progressive hair cell damage and loss. The compound action potential (<b>CAP)</b> <b>thresholds</b> of Bth/+ mice were raised and correlated with the degree of hair cell loss. Homozygous mutants (dn/dn and Bth/Bth) never showed CAP responses, even at ages where many hair cells were still present in the apex of the cochlea, suggesting their hair cells never function normally. We propose that Tmc 1 is involved in trafficking of molecules to the plasma membrane or serves as an intracellular regulatory signal for differentiation of immature hair cells into fully functional auditory receptors...|$|R

40|$|Gross-potential {{recordings}} in mice {{lacking the}} Prestin gene indicate that compound action potential (<b>CAP)</b> <b>thresholds</b> are shifted by ∼ 45 dB at 5 kHz and by ∼ 60 dB at 33 kHz. However, {{in order to}} conclude that outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility {{is associated with the}} cochlear amplifier, frequency selectivity must be evaluated and the integrity of the OHC's forward transducer ascertained. The present report demonstrates no frequency selectivity in CAP tuning curves recorded in homozygotes. In addition, CAP input–output functions indicate that responses in knockout mice approach those in controls at high levels where the amplifier has little influence. Although the cochlear microphonic in knockout mice remains ∼ 12 dB below that in wild-type mice even at the highest levels, this deficit is thought to reflect hair cell losses in mice lacking prestin. A change in OHC forward transduction is not implied because knockout mice display non-linear responses similar to those in controls. For example, homozygotes exhibit a bipolar summating potential (SP) with positive responses at high frequencies; negative responses at low frequencies. Measurement of intermodulation distortion also shows that the cubic difference tone, 2 f 1 –f 2, is ∼ 20 dB down from the primaries in both homozygotes and their controls. Because OHCs are the sole generators of the negative SP and because 2 f 1 –f 2 is also thought to originate in OHC transduction, these data support the idea that forward transduction is not degraded in OHCs lacking prestin. Finally, application of AM 1 - 43, which initially enters hair cells through their transducer channels, produces fluorescence in wild-type and knockout mice indicating transducer channel activity in both inner and outer hair cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract of Poster 137 This is an {{abstract}} of a poster presentation from the Proceedings of the Australian Neuroscience Society 1998. This version is reproduced {{with the permission}} of the publisher. Speech processing strategies based on high rate electrical stimulation have been associated with recent improvements of speech perception among cochlear implant users. In the present study we investigated the effects of chronic monopolar stimulation using very high rates (14493 pulses). Under general anaesthesia (ketamine (20 mg/kg) and xylazine (3. 8 mg/kg) i. p.) six normal hearing cats were implanted bilaterally with a three channel platinum (Pt) scala tympani electrode array, while a return Pt-electrode was placed outside the bulla. Chronic electrical stimulation using charge-balanced biphasic current pulses was delivered unilaterally via a transcutaneous leadwire connected to a backpack-stimulator for up to 2000 h. The animals hearing status was periodically monitored using acoustically evoked compound action potentials (CAP's) and brainstem responses (ABR's). In addition the electrically evoked ABR (EABR) was also recorded to ensure that the chronic stimulus was above threshold. Stimulus current and electrode voltage waveforms were monitored twice daily and access resistance (Ra) and electrode impedance (Zc) calculated. ABR and <b>CAP</b> <b>thresholds</b> were elevated immediately following implantation, but generally showed evidence of partial recovery (0 - 40 dB). Further deterioration of thresholds on the stimulated side (10 - 30 dB) was subsequently observed, while control-thresholds remained more stable. Ra (1. 3 - 1. 8 kΩ) and Zc (2. 2 - 3. 8 Ω) typically increased in the first few weeks of electrical stimulation up to Ra: 5. 6 kΩ and Zc: 8. 1 kΩ, before decreasing slightly to a constant plateau. These initial results indicate changes in the electrode-tissue interface and tissue growth within the cochlea. They also indicate that chronic stimulation at these high rates may decrease residual hearing. 27 - 30 JanuaryOpen Acces...|$|R
40|$|Gerbils aged {{in quiet}} show {{a decline of}} the endocochlear {{potential}} (EP) and elevated auditory nerve compound action potential (<b>CAP)</b> <b>thresholds.</b> However, establishing a direct relationship between an age-related reduction in the EP {{and changes in the}} activities of primary auditory neurons is difficult owing to the complexity of age-related histological changes in the cochlea. To address this issue, we developed a young gerbil model of “metabolic” presbyacusis that uses an osmotic pump to deliver furosemide into the round window niche for 7  days, resulting in a chronically reduced EP. In this model, the only major histopathologic changes were restricted to the hook region of the cochlea and consisted of loss of strial intermediate cells and massive edema in the lateral wall. The morphological and physiological evidence suggests that the cochlea can adapt to furosemide application over time. The morphology of spiral ganglion cells and hair cells appeared normal throughout the cochlea. CAP responses and EP values in this model {{are similar to those of}} quiet-aged ears. The spontaneous activity of single auditory fibers (n[*]=[*] 188) was assessed in 15 young gerbils treated with furosemide for 7  days. The percentage of recorded low-spontaneous rate (SR) fibers at characteristic frequencies (CFs) [*]≥[*] 6  kHz was significantly lower in furosemide-treated than in control ears. Recovery function tests of CAP responses after prior stimulation also showed a decline in activity of the low-SR population with CFs[*]≥[*] 6  kHz in the treated cochleas. A similar loss in the activity of low-SR fiber has been previously shown in quiet-aged gerbils. These results suggest that dysfunction of the cochlear lateral wall and subsequent chronic reduction in the EP can directly affect the activity patterns of primary auditory neurons in a manner similar to that seen in aged gerbils...|$|R
40|$|Income <b>cap</b> or <b>threshold</b> systems rely on {{incentives}} that encourage physicians to limit medical expenditures, but {{little is known}} about how physicians respond to these incentives. Conceptually, the threshold system is to physicians what an income tax system is to taxpayers. We exploit this similarity to analyze the impact of a reform that changed what is included in the 'taxable' billings of physicians in Ontario, Canada. We find that for services that the reform turned from exempted to non-exempted, the reform had a strong, negative impact for physicians with billings above the minimum threshold and a negligible impact for physicians below the threshold. The reform had no impact on services that were non-exempted {{both before and after the}} reform. This response of physicians to the threshold reform resembles the expected response of taxpayers to a similar change in the income tax system...|$|R
40|$|The cochlea presumably {{possesses}} {{a number of}} regulatory mechanisms to maintain cochlear sensitivity {{in the face of}} disturbances to its function. Evidence for such mechanisms {{can be found in the}} time-course of the recovery of <b>CAP</b> <b>thresholds</b> during experimental manipulations, and in observations of slow oscillations in cochlear micromechanics following exposure to LF tones (the 'bounce phenomenon') and other perturbations. To increase our understanding of the regulatory processes within the cochlea, and OHCs in particular, we have developed a mathematical model of the OHC that takes into account its known electrical properties, and includes the effect of fast and slow-motility of the cell body on transducer operating point and apical conductance. Central to the operation of the model is a putative intracellular 2 nd-messenger system based on cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration. Cytosolic Ca 2 + is involved in regulation of i) the operating point of OHC MET channels via slow motility and axial stiffness; ii) the permeability of the basolateral wall to potassium via Ca 2 +-sensitive potassium channels; and iii) the cytosolic concentration of Ca 2 + itself, via extrusion from the OHC (via the Ca 2 +-ATPases in the plasma membrane) and Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 +-release (CICR) from intracellular Ca 2 + storage organelles. The permeability of the OHC basolateral wall determines the standing current through the OHCs (and therefore a component of EP regulation), and in the presence of sound, affects the magnitude of the AC receptor potential that drives the prestin-mediated somatic electromotility and active gain. The mathematical model we have developed provides a physiologically-plausible and internally-consistent explanation for the time-courses of the cochlear changes observed during a number of different perturbations. We show how much of the oscillatory behaviour can be attributed to oscillations in cytosolic calcium concentration, and present results from the model for a number of simulations, including DC current injection into scala media, perilymphatic perfusions, and exposure to LF tones, and compare the results of these simulations to experimental data recorded from the guinea pig...|$|R
