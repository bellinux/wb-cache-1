40|$|The {{loss of a}} {{loved one}} can affect family {{dynamics}} by changing the family system and creating the need for family members to reorganize. Good family functioning, which is characterized by open communication, expression of feelings and thoughts and cohesion among family members, facilitates adaptive adjustment to the loss. This study conducted a systematic review of the literature on family dynamics during the grieving process. A search was conducted in the EBSCO, Web of Knowledge and Bireme databases for scientific articles published from January 1980 to June 2013. Of the 389 articles found, only 15 met all the inclusion criteria. The selected studies provided evidence that dysfunctional families exhibit more psychopathological symptoms, more psychosocial morbidity, poorer social functioning, greater difficulty accessing community resources, lower functional capacity at work, and a more <b>complicated</b> <b>grieving</b> process. Family conflicts were also emphasized as contributing {{to the development of a}} <b>complicated</b> <b>grieving</b> process, while cohesion, expression of affection and good communication in families are believed to mitigate grief symptoms...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{demonstrate}} the importance of understanding and recognizing grief, this research project explores the capacity for young adults within the college setting to experience two negative grief processes: disenfranchised and <b>complicated</b> <b>grieving.</b> In broad terms, disenfranchised grief occurs when society does not recognize the grief a bereaved person is experiencing; complicated grief occurs when the bereaved continues to grieve for a prolonged {{period of time in}} which they are unable to adapt to their life. While {{it can be difficult to}} define a specific population who is at risk for experiencing these types of grief, society often fails to recall that death and subsequent grief can be experienced at any time during life, resulting in a lack of realization that college-age students are no less susceptible to experiencing g loss and grief. I argue that this population is underrepresented in relation to recognizing and experiencing a grieving process, perhaps leading them towards a disenfranchised and <b>complicated</b> <b>grieving</b> pathway more often than society realizes. With a particular focus on research from Dr. Kenneth Doka, among other thanatologists, my research examines both disenfranchised and <b>complicated</b> <b>grieving</b> processes in relation to experiencing them while in a college setting; focusing on topics such as how the college culture, relationships with the deceased, and mode of death and stigma impact the grieving process along with gender, social media, and meaning-making influences on grief. In hopes of combatting this lack of representation and to educate others on disenfranchised and complicated grief, I created a presentation entitled, “Death Education for Resident Advisors: Helpful vs. Harmful Responses” and presented it to The University of Rhode Island House and Residential Life’s Resident Advisors during their winter training, in conjunctions with my research paper. This experience, along with my research, enabled me to expand my personal knowledge while representing this unrecognized population. Death is a difficult subject matter for many, and bringing the topic of grief, especially grief that is, by definition, more challenging to move through, to the foreground of academia is necessary to further education and decrease instances of negative grief. Like the inevitability of death, there is the inevitability of grief. Despite this definitive process of death and subsequent grief of the survivor, the mode in which death occurs and the type of grief experienced are not definitive or predictable in nature. This contributes to an individualized grieving process, a course that society deeply struggles to openly value and discuss. This research explores these grieving processes to allow for an important and greater conversation about grief to begin...|$|E
40|$|Parents who {{experience}} the sudden {{death of a}} child will interact with many professionals in the period immediately following the death notification through to the funeral. The way these professionals respond to the parents during this critical period may be perceived as helpful, and thus support them in beginning the process of managing the trauma and starting a healthy grieving process. It may also be perceived as unhelpful, though, and contribute to more prolonged and <b>complicated</b> <b>grieving.</b> This article identifies the interventions that a sample of 20 parents who had experienced {{the sudden death of}} a child found helpful with different aspects of grieving. Specific advice is given to police, nurses, doctors, coroners, social workers, crisis counselors, funeral directors, and chaplains or clergy...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} {{findings}} that convey how people felt stigmatized {{after the loss}} of a loved one to suicide. A qualitative design was used {{for the purpose of this}} study. Data were collected using in-depth, face-to-face interviews. Audio-recordings of the interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed. Ten people bereaved by suicide participated in the study. Four themes emerged from the data namely: Feeling blamed, shamed and judged; Feeling isolated/rejected by friends and community; Feeling silenced and Feeling the burden of others' discomfort. Findings show that stigmatization of the bereaved by suicide had detrimental effects on their relationships and their help seeking behaviours. Further, due to stigma imposed on them by others, participants were denied the opportunity to tell their stories which further <b>complicated</b> their <b>grieving</b> process. Further education and training is required for health professionals to enhance understanding of the specific needs of those bereaved by suicide...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the death}} of a loved one, a small group of grievers develop an {{abnormal}} <b>grieving</b> style, termed <b>complicated</b> or prolonged grief. In the effort to establish complicated grief as a disorder in DSM and ICD, several attempts have been made {{over the past two decades}} to establish symptom criteria for this form of <b>grieving.</b> <b>Complicated</b> grief is different from depression and PTSD yet often comorbid with other psychological disorders. Meta-analyses of grief interventions show small to medium effect sizes, with only few studies yielding large effect sizes. In this article, an integrative cognitive behavioral treatment manual for complicated grief disorder (CG-CBT) of 25 individual sessions is described. Three treatment phases, each entailing several treatment strategies, allow patients to stabilize, explore, and confront the most painful aspects of the loss, and finally to integrate and transform their grief. Core aspects are cognitive restructuring and confrontation. Special attention is given to practical exercises. This article includes the case report of a woman whose daughter committed suicide...|$|R
40|$|Background: Student {{bereavement}} {{is associated}} with a greater risk of depression, insomnia and worsened academic performance and social functioning (Balk, 2010). Pressures to make new friends and search for a career path, the expectation to ‘have fun’, and living away from one’s family are factors which <b>complicate</b> the <b>grieving</b> process (Balk&Vesta, 1998; Janowiak et al., 1995). Objectives: The present study aims to gain a deeper understanding of students’ experiences of bereavement, the challenges they face, and their coping strategies. Methods: Six individuals, aged 20 - 25, were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. The Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis aimed to understand students’ lived experience of bereavement in a university setting and care was taken to meaningfully interpret their accounts. Results: Four master themes were yielded by the analysis. ‘Alienating Grief’ captured the sense of loneliness and isolation that participants felt {{as a result of their}} uncommon experience within the university setting, and their contradictory desires to ‘fit in’ by wearing a mask so as not to alienate themselves further by discussing death with their friends. ‘‘I just have to carry on’’ was a theme identifying conflicting demands: to be a good student, social and hard-working, and how this was complicated by being a grieving child/sibling. ‘Complex emotions’ reflected participants’ struggle between anger and guilt, relief and disappointment. ‘Conflicting pressures’ discussed the roles of stress and worsened wellbeing and their impact on coping mechanisms. Conclusion: The themes identified by the present study supported the existing evidence for the struggles students undergo when facing bereavement in a university setting and shed light onto future research possibilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{rigorous}} thesis "Experiencing loss of child" {{deals with}} the psychological aspects of adaptation {{to the loss of}} a child. Its main objective is to analyse the supporting factors that help the adaptation and factors that make the process of adaptation more difficult. Furthermore, we intended to find out how such loss influences individuals and their subsequent life and to describe the process of the loss of a child as such. The theoretical part of the thesis focuses {{on the issue of the}} loss of a close person and details the specifics of the loss of a child. Based on available literature the author explores the process of grieving and its manifestations and determines the variables that influence the adaptation to a child loss with a focus on the connection between the loss of a child and <b>complicated</b> <b>grieving.</b> She also evaluates the impact of the child loss on the individual and the potential for intervention in the process. The empirical part determines both the factors that help to cope with such loss and factors that make the adaptation more complicated. It also describes how the loss influences the life of the individual and focuses on the needs of the bereaved parents. The data gathering consisted of ten individual in-depth interviews with women which experienced the loss of a child. These [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{sudden death}} of a child is likely the most traumatizing event a parent can experience. Traumatic death, and {{particularly}} the {{death of a}} child, increases the risk of a <b>complicated</b> <b>grieving</b> process in mourners. Little has been written with respect to the interventions of professionals with parents at the time of a sudden {{death of a child}}. The present study examines the experiences of parents with a variety of professionals from the time of death notification through the funeral. Twenty parents who were involved in Bereaved Families of Ontario participated in this study. The purpose was to examine the impact of professional interventions on the grieving process of the parents. Qualitative inquiry was utilized with the heuristic aspect of the phenomenological approach using semi-structured, open-ended interviews. Thematic analysis was completed at two levels. The first identified three key themes in helping: the provision of instrumental assistance, compassion and information. The themes in grieving were the reconstruction of the death scene, issues of control and the assumptive world, saying goodbye, making sense of the death, and carrying the deceased child forward in a new world. The integration of these themes produced concrete ways of helping parents through the trauma, and facilitating a healthy grieving process. The conclusion of the study outlines the clinical implications of these significant findings...|$|E
40|$|Being a man {{or woman}} {{is at the core of}} human social lives and {{personal}} identity, and guides appropriate behaviours such as dress, mannerisms and relationships. Transvestism, or the practice of wearing the clothes of the other gender, challenges societal values and guidelines for behaviour. The attitude of society to this practice has varied from veneration to vilification depending on the period of history and the culture of the people. In western countries, although there is little social or legal repression, transvestism is largely a hidden phenomena. The tradition of comic drag has dominated public recognition of cross-dressing. Hence transvestites are perceived to be freakish or funny. Transvestites often marry, or form a committed heterosexual relationship without telling their partner of their cross-dressing. Because the public largely ignores the practice of transvestism, women who are married to, or form committed relationships with a transvestite are rendered invisible. The invisibility isolates women from information and social support. Although a substantial amount of literature is available regarding the nature of transvestism and the experience of transvestites, only sporadic attempts have been· made to understand the experience of, and influence on, the wives or committed partners of transvestites. The purpose of this study was to describe the experience of living in a committed relationship with a transvestite from the point of view of the woman. A phenomenological approach to data collection and content analysis identified emergent themes arising from in-depth interviews with nine women who were currently living, or had in the past lived, in a committed relationship with a transvestite. The women were aged between 38 and 84, resided in Western Australia and were of English speaking background. Significantly, some participants had left the relationship. This group of women has never been accessed in previous research hence their input increases the overall knowledge of the experiences of women in relationship with a transvestite. Women described the disclosure of transvestism by their partner to be a great shock that precipitated a long period of <b>complicated</b> <b>grieving.</b> Analysis of data indicated that the relationships between their partner and the femme identity of the man and the woman, whilst unintentional on the part of the man, was experienced as emotionally and sexually abusive by the women. The women resolved the conflict in various ways. Some recommitted to a renegotiated relationship and some tolerated their partners behaviour. Most felt trapped within the relationship at some stage. The majority of women chose to leave the relationship. In retrospect, the women recognised positive changes within themselves as a result of overcoming adversity...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a modified}} systematic review {{with the purpose}} of exploring the following questions: What is grief? What is complicated grief? How do we work therapeutically with complicated grief? Theoretical perspectives on what constitutes normal grief have evolved from one of placing a time frame for the conclusion of grieving, to accepting that grieving is a unique and varied experience that may take a lifetime to resolve. The significance of this can be demonstrated during periods of loss in adulthood when old bereavements and losses from childhood can be revived. How an individual deals with grief in response to loss is also dependent {{on a wide range of}} variables, including the type of relationship to, or nature of, the attachment to what is lost, the circumstances surrounding the loss and whether there has been support from others after the loss. In this the power of community in transitioning through grief is an important part of the grieving process. Ironically, part of the increased use of therapists to work through grief is a result of changes in society and family and social supports being less available. Factors <b>complicating</b> the <b>grieving</b> process include the presence of prior traumatic loss in childhood, individuals with psychiatric illness, and the lack of social support at the time of loss. Often separation distress is at the core of complicated grief. The importance of a good relationship between therapist and client is a strong indicator of a successful outcome where the therapist needs to be mindful of unrealistic assumptions about the process of grieving...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues that an individual confronts during one 2 ̆ 7 s life is the death of a significant person. Given the contextual nature of grief, incarcerated women are faced with unique challenges when the death of a person occurs during their imprisonment. Yet, little is known about grief experiences under these circumstances. ^ The research questions guiding this qualitative study were: What are the meanings of the grief experience of incarcerated women? How does their grieving process compare with images of grief depicted as a normal process? To what extent do the women perceive incarceration influencing their grief? In-depth interviews with three women in a medium security prison in New England were completed and analyzed with regard to self-understanding, critical commonsense understanding, and theoretical understanding based on Kvale 2 ̆ 7 s (1983, 1996) approach to the interpretation of texts. In addition, narratives extrapolated from the interviews were analyzed using Gee 2 ̆ 7 s (1985, 1986, 1991) and Reissman 2 ̆ 7 s (1993) approach to narrative analysis. ^ For all three women two events (the delivery of the news of the death and going to the funeral home) were particularly stressful. All the women exhibited an acute grief response which could be expected given the nature of their relationship with their loved one. However, their grief was “suspended. ” The women were unable to express their grief, participate in important public rituals, and access adequate resources to support their coping. The context of the prison <b>complicated</b> the <b>grieving</b> process resulting in disenfranchised grief. This finding raises critical questions regarding possible complicated bereavement, which can further impact the adjustment to the multiple challenges that women confront when they are released from prison. ^ Implications for nursing knowledge development, nursing practice and education, and the criminal justice system were discussed. Recommendations included longitudinal research studies, education of nurses and nursing students about disenfranchised grief, and policy changes in the criminal justice system. ...|$|R
40|$|O estudo tem como objeto a revisÃo do diagnÃstico de enfermagem Processos familiares disfuncionais relacionados a abuso de Ãlcool. Estudo metodolÃgico, desenvolvido em trÃs etapas: anÃlise de conceito, anÃlise de conteÃdo por especialistas e anÃlise da acurÃcia de indicadores clÃnicos. Para a realizaÃÃo da anÃlise de conceito, utilizou-se como referÃncia o modelo de anÃlise de conceito proposto por Walker e Avant e os passos da revisÃo integrativa da {{literatura}}. Procedeu-se Ã busca na literatura em trÃs bases de dados: SCOPUS, PubMed e CINAHL, com os descritores alcoolismo e famÃlia disfuncional e suas sinonÃmias nas lÃnguas inglesa e espanhola. ApÃs a aplicaÃÃo dos critÃrios de inclusÃo e exclusÃo, restaram 11 estudos de um total de 113 que subsidiaram a anÃlise do conceito. A partir da revisÃo do conceito famÃlia disfuncional e sua correlaÃÃo com o diagnÃstico de enfermagem Processos familiares disfuncionais, foi possÃvel reduzir o quantitativo de 115 caracterÃsticas definidoras para 91, por meio da exclusÃo de 24 caracterÃsticas que apresentaram significado semelhante a outros indicadores ou por nÃo se aplicarem a alcoolistas adultos. TrÃs caracterÃsticas foram condensadas em uma e foram incorporadas duas novas caracterÃsticas definidoras: abuso fÃsico e abuso sexual. Foram utilizados artigos, livros e dicionÃrios para a construÃÃo das definiÃÃes conceituais e operacionais das 91 caracterÃsticas definidoras. A segunda etapa do estudo, anÃlise de conteÃdo por especialistas, consistiu no julgamento por 23 especialistas quanto Ã relevÃncia, clareza e precisÃo das definiÃÃes construÃdas na etapa anterior. Dois itens foram julgados como inadequados no critÃrio relevÃncia e, portanto, excluÃdos do estudo. Dezessete itens tiveram suas definiÃÃes julgadas como inadequadas nos critÃrios clareza e/ou precisÃo e foram reformuladas. Duas caracterÃsticas tiveram seu rÃtulo modificado segundo sugestÃes dos especialistas. Para esta etapa, considerou-se o nÃvel de concordÃncia de 85 %. A partir das definiÃÃes operacionais das 89 caracterÃsticas definidoras julgadas como relevantes pelos especialistas, foi construÃdo o instrumento de coleta de dados aplicado com 110 alcoolistas internados em uma unidade de cuidados prolongados para tratamento de alcoolismo crÃnico. Para a delimitaÃÃo da amostra, foi realizado cÃlculo amostral e estabelecidos critÃrios de inclusÃo e exclusÃo. Os dados foram coletados por meio de entrevista e analisou-se a presenÃa ou ausÃncia de cada indicador clinico. Os dados foram submetidos Ã anÃlise de classe latente, que permitiu encontrar um conjunto de vinte e quatro caracterÃsticas que apresentaram bom ajuste para a correta identificaÃÃo do diagnÃstico Processos familiares disfuncionais. As caracterÃsticas definidoras Papeis familiares interrompidos, Problemas econÃmicos e Rituais familiares interrompidos apresentaram boa sensibilidade e especificidade. As caracterÃsticas definidoras Abuso sexual, DistÃrbio no desempenho escolar em crianÃas, ManipulaÃÃo, Falta de coesÃo e Baixa autoestima crÃnica apresentaram valor de especificidade significativo. As demais mostraram valor de sensibilidade significativo: Mentiras, AngÃstia, Ansiedade, ConfusÃo, Constrangimento, Perda, Raiva, ComunicaÃÃo contraditÃria, Dificuldade com relacionamentos Ãntimos, Imaturidade, Tristeza nÃo resolvida, DeterioraÃÃo nos relacionamentos familiares, DinÃmicas familiares perturbadas, Problemas conjugais, InseguranÃa e SolidÃo. A revisÃo do diagnÃstico Processos familiares disfuncionais relacionados a abuso de Ãlcool possibilitou uma reflexÃo crÃtica acerca das caracterÃsticas definidoras constantes na NANDA-I, com vistas ao seu refinamento. Espera-se que este estudo possa auxiliar o enfermeiro na sua prÃtica assistencial a identificar o referido diagnÃstico de modo mais acurado. The study focuses {{the review}} of the nursing diagnosis Dysfunctional family processes related to alcohol abuse. Methodological study, developed in three stages: concept analysis, content analysis by experts and analysis of the accuracy of clinical indicators. For the realization concept analysis, was used as reference the concept analysis model proposed by Walker and Avant and steps of the integrative literature review. Proceeded the literature search in three databases: SCOPUS, PubMed and CINAHL, with descriptors alcoholism and dysfunctional family and their synonyms in English and Spanish. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 11 studies remained from a total of 113 that supported the concept analysis. From {{the review of}} the concept dysfunctional family and its correlation with the nursing diagnosis of Dysfunctional family processes, it was possible to reduce the quantitative defining characteristics from 115 to 91, by deleting the 24 characteristics that were similar to other indicators or meaning is not apply to adult alcoholics. Three characteristics were condensed into one and were incorporated two new defining characteristics: Physical abuse and Sexual abuse. Articles, books and dictionaries were used to build the conceptual and operational definitions of the 91 defining characteristics. The second stage of the study, content analysis by experts consisted at trial of 23 experts for relevance, clarity and accuracy of definitions constructed in the previous step. Two items were judged as inappropriate in relevance criteria and therefore excluded from the study. 17 items had their definitions judged as inadequate on the clarity and/or precision criteria and have been reformulated. Two had their labels modified second suggestions from experts. For this step, was considered the level of agreement of 85 %. From the operational definitions of the 89 defining characteristics judged as relevant by experts, was built the instrument of data collection applied with 110 alcoholics admitted to a unit for extended care treatment of chronic alcoholism. For the delimitation of the sample, sample size calculation was performed and established criteria for inclusion and exclusion. Data were collected through interviews and analyzed for {{the presence or absence of}} each clinical indicator. The data were subjected to latent class analysis, which allowed to find a set of twenty-four characteristics that showed good fit for the correct identification of diagnostic Dysfunctional family processes. The defining characteristics Disrupted family roles, Economic problems and Disrupted family rituals showed good sensitivity and specificity. The defining characteristics Sexual abuse, Disturbances in academic performance in children, Manipulation, Lack of cohesiveness and Chronic low self-esteem showed the mean value of specificity. The other showed the mean value of sensitivity: Lying, Distress, Anxiety, Confusion, Embarrassment, Loss, Anger, Contradictory communication, Difficulty with intimate relationships, Immaturity, <b>Complicated</b> <b>grieving,</b> Deterioration in family relationships, Disturbed family dynamics, Marital problems, Insecurity and Loneliness [...] A review of the diagnosis Dysfunctional family processes related to alcohol abuse provided a critical analysis of the defining characteristics listed in the NANDA-I, with a view to its refinement.
