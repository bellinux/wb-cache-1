25|$|Joan Miró {{was one of}} {{the first}} and most {{successful}} stain painters. Although staining in oil was considered dangerous to cotton canvas in the long run, Miró's example during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s was an inspiration and an influence on the younger generation. One of the reasons for the success of the Color Field movement was the technique of staining. Artists would mix and dilute their paint in buckets or coffee cans making a fluid liquid and then they would pour it into raw unprimed canvas, generally <b>cotton</b> <b>duck.</b> The paint could also be brushed on or rolled on or thrown on or poured on or sprayed on, and would spread into the fabric of the canvas. Generally artists would draw shapes and areas as they stained. Many different artists employed staining as the technique of choice to use in making their paintings. James Brooks, Jackson Pollock, Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Paul Jenkins and dozens of other painters found that pouring and staining opened the door to innovations and revolutionary methods of drawing and expressing meaning in new ways. The number of artists who stained in the 1960s greatly increased with the availability of acrylic paint. Staining acrylic paint into the fabric of <b>cotton</b> <b>duck</b> canvas was more benign and less damaging to the fabric of the canvas than the use of oil paint.|$|E
25|$|The Eureka Tent & Awning Company {{was founded}} {{sometime}} before 1895 in Binghamton, New York. The company’s first workshop on Binghamton’s Commercial Avenue originally produced custom tents, awnings, wagon covers, horse blankets, and flags. The company employed early manufacturing processes, such as using dies to cut stars and sewing together strips {{of red and}} white bunting to make American flags. Eureka fashioned its first awnings out of unfinished natural white <b>cotton</b> <b>duck</b> and designed them to maximize the amount of light allowed into the storefront while still providing adequate shade to passers-by. Eureka’s earliest tents, assembled from untreated white army duck, were so sturdy that one completely usable early Eureka tent still hung in the company’s headquarters nearly one hundred years later.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} uniform for {{the majority}} of regiments throughout the period was the traditional red coat. There was no standardised supply for uniforms, and it was generally left to the regimental colonel to contract for and obtain uniforms for his men, which allowed for some regimental variation. Generally, this was in the form of specific regimental badges, or ornamentation for specialised flank companies, but occasionally major differences existed. Highland regiments generally wore kilts and ostrich feather hats, although six of these regiments exchanged the kilt for regulation trousers or tartan trews in 1809. Officers of Highland regiments wore a crimson silk sash worn from the left shoulder to the right hip. Regimental tartans were worn but they were all derived from the Black Watch tartan. White, yellow or red lines were added to distinguish between regiments. Trousers for the rank and file were generally of white <b>cotton</b> <b>duck</b> canvas for summer use, and grey woolen trousers were issued for winter wear, although considerable variation exists in the color of the woolen trousers. Originally, the white trousers were cut as overalls, designed to be worn to protect the expensive breeches and gaiters worn by the rank and file, although on campaign, they were often worn by themselves; a practice which was later permitted except on parade. Soldiers were also issued with grey greatcoats starting in 1803.|$|E
50|$|Individual filled {{bags are}} not too heavy to lift and move into place. They may be laid in {{excavated}} defences as revetment, or as free-standing walls above ground where excavations are impractical. As plain burlap sandbags deteriorate fairly quickly, sandbag structures meant to remain {{in place for a}} long time may be painted with a portland cement slurry to reduce the effects of rot and abrasion. <b>Cotton</b> <b>ducking</b> sandbags last considerably longer than burlap and are hence preferable for long-term use. However, the vast majority of sandbags used by modern military and for flood prevention are made of circular woven polypropylene.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of this lightweight rucksack led to an informal inquiry by officers of the infantry community as {{to the possibility of}} reducing the weight of the M-1956 Load-Carrying Equipment (LCE). As a result of this interest, the army produced a set of LCE in 1962, substituting available nylon materials for the <b>cotton</b> canvas <b>duck.</b> This set of nylon load-carrying equipment weighed slightly more than 3 lb as opposed to 5 lb for the <b>cotton</b> canvas <b>duck</b> items. These two items, the lightweight rucksack and the set of nylon LCE, formed the basis for that portion of the LINCLOE Quantitative Material Requirement dealing with load-carrying equipment. Annex A to the Quantitative Material Requirement set a goal of 3.3 lb for the individual load-carrying equipment and 3 lb for the rucksack. Officials decided that the design of the new load-carrying equipment would follow that of the standard load-carrying equipment with material changes from <b>cotton</b> canvas <b>duck</b> to nylon duck and replacement of the brass and steel hardware with aluminum or plastic items.|$|R

2500|$|... {{rail line}} from Baltimore to Washington, the Patuxent Manufacturing Company was {{chartered}} by Horace Capon, Edward Snowden, Theodore Jenkins, W.C. Shaw, A.E. Hall, and O.C. Tiffany and the mill expanded greatly {{with the addition}} of the Avondale Mill building in 1844. Mill president Horace Capron with his partners built housing for close to 300 workers, and a bigger cotton mill. <b>Cotton</b> <b>duck</b> from the mill was shipped down what would become Laurel’s Main Street, then by rail to Baltimore. A substantial dam was built in 1850. As a mill town, Laurel was somewhat unusual in Prince George’s County and was surrounded by agricultural endeavors.|$|E
50|$|Operations at the Laurel Mill in {{the early}} twentieth century focused solely on <b>cotton</b> <b>duck.</b> In 1901, the Laurel Mills company was {{consolidated}} into the <b>Cotton</b> <b>Duck</b> Company (of the Mount Vernon-Woodberry <b>Cotton</b> <b>Duck</b> Company). In 1911 the Consolidated <b>Cotton</b> <b>Duck</b> Company was leased by the Ramie Company of New England. During World War I, much like during the Civil War, mill operations shut down, and the building housed soldiers from Camp Meade, which later became Fort George G. Meade. Between 1922 and 1929 the mill built window shades for the Lapsley Interstate Shade Cloth Company, and shut down in 1929. The building and mill race stood until the 1940s, when it was destroyed. The abandoned dam remained across the Patuxent River until the 1960s, and a portion of the bulwark on the Prince George's County side of the river remains standing.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{development}} of the LINCLOE load-carrying equipment did not officially start until after the United States Army Materiel Command Technical Committee (AMCTC) approved the project 27 April 1966, development of lightweight load-carrying equipment really began in 1961 with {{the development}} of the Lightweight Rucksack (FSN 8465-782-3248) made of nylon fabrics and an aluminum frame which weighed 3 lb as compared to the 7.5 lb <b>cotton</b> canvas <b>duck</b> and steel item which it replaced.|$|R

50|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, Moodus was the “Twine Capital of America,” with twelve mills in operation. The most {{successful}} was Brownell & Company. Moodus {{was in an}} ideal location for textile production since it had access to ample water power and shipping (via the Connecticut River and the Connecticut Valley Railroad), and {{it was close to}} an enormous trading center and market, New York City. Moodus's mills primarily manufactured <b>cotton</b> yarn, <b>duck,</b> and twine, and that production lasted from 1819 to 1977. The mills also produced certain related products, particularly fishing nets and pearl buttons. A part of that textile mill history is preserved in the Johnsonville historical section of Moodus, named after one of the mill owners. Brownell was a pioneer with DuPont Corporation in the production of nylon products, and Brownell still manufacturers specialized textile-related products in Moodus such as archery bowstrings, helicopter cargo nets, and tennis nets.|$|R
5000|$|In December 1870, Davis {{was asked}} by a {{customer}} to make a pair of strong working pants for her husband who was a woodcutter.

Such was {{the success of these}} pants that word spread throughout the labourers along the railroad. Davis was making these working pants in <b>duck</b> <b>cotton</b> and, as early as 1871, in denim cotton. Before long, he found he could not keep up with demand.|$|R

50|$|The United States Army {{entered the}} {{conflict}} in Southeast Asia with the canvas and <b>cotton</b> <b>duck</b> M-1956 Load-Carrying Equipment (LCE). Developed in the early 1950s, the LCE was designed for use with all small arms then in service with the Army. Deficiencies with the LCE were immediately realized once fielded in the tropical climates of Vietnam. Canvas, <b>cotton</b> <b>duck</b> and webbing, even when treated to prevent mildew, is still affected by it, along with dry rot due to constant wetting and drying. Cotton also absorbed {{a great deal of}} water, adding to its weight, and was slow drying; it also withstood abrasion poorly.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} years of the Vietnam conflict, some U.S. Army units were {{equipped}} with the M-1945 Tropical Combat Boot. [...] In 1965, a boot incorporating most of the improvements developed since the end of World War II for tropical climates was adopted by the U.S. military as the M-1966 Jungle Boot, developed by the Natick Laboratories and the shoe industry. In the improved boot, the upper was made of <b>cotton</b> canvas <b>duck,</b> with leather for the toe and heel, and nylon reinforcements for the neck of the boot. [...] The new Jungle boot originally used a Vibram-type lugged composition rubber sole strongly vulcanized to the leather toe and heel. [...] Water drains (screened eyelets) were added to the canvas top near the sole to quickly drain water from the inside of the boot. [...] Removable ventilating insoles made of fused layers of Saran plastic screen, first invented in 1942, were issued with the Jungle boot.|$|R
50|$|The design effort went slowly, {{due to the}} {{concentration}} on the design and development of items to meet the requirement of the Vietnam War, although developers initiated projects investigating the feasibility of replacing much of the steel and brass hardware with aluminum or plastic items. On 15 March 1967, an Engineering Concept Review was held at Natick Laboratories. The concept approved at the meeting was for an individual equipment belt to be supported by individual equipment suspenders, to which could be attached component items such as small arms ammunition cases, water canteen covers, entrenching tool carriers, field first aid dressing cases, etc. A field pack somewhat larger than the M-1961 <b>cotton</b> canvas <b>duck</b> field pack was proposed which could be attached for carrying either on the individual equipment belt at the small of the back, or on the shoulders attached to the individual equipment belt suspenders, or attached to a detachable field pack frame. The field pack frame with shoulder straps and a removable cargo shelf would be designed to be worn over the individual equipment belt and suspenders. The end result of this meeting was {{the adoption of the}} nylon M-1967 Modernized Load-Carrying Equipment (MLCE). The field pack design was rejected in the end and a nylon version of the M-1961 field pack was produced instead along with the nylon Tropical Rucksack (FSN 8465-935-6673).|$|R
50|$|Oregon State {{opened the}} 1995 season in Corvallis against 1-AA Idaho. The Beavers {{held on to}} win 14-7 but had more punts than first downs. Despite the close win, Oregon State gave Pettibone a {{contract}} extension through 1998. The following weekend, the Oregon State lost to University of the Pacific 23-10. It was Pacific's most lopsided victory in 1995, their final year with a football team. The following weekend in Denton, Texas, Oregon State hopped out to a 27-23 fourth quarter lead over North Texas, playing in their first home game as a Division 1-A team. The Mean Green were still looking for their first win as a Division 1-A team when North Texas' Jason Mills threw a 4-yard touchdown pass with nine seconds left. The win would be the Mean Green's only one over a Division 1-A team in 1995. Oregon State lost the next three games to Arizona State and the Washington schools. Against California, the Beavers hopped out to a 12-6 first-half lead but gave up a touchdown with 6:40 left to lose 13-12. Oregon State proceeded to lose their final four games. The final two were particularly vexing, as the Trojans (Rose) and the <b>Ducks</b> (<b>Cotton)</b> each wrapped up New Year's Day bowl games. Also, with the win, the Ducks became the first home team to win the Civil War in six years.|$|R
