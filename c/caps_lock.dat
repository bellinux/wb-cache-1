5|$|There are two {{versions}} of the PowerBook100's QWERTY layout keyboard: a domestic US version with 63keys and an international ISO version with 64keys. The <b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> key on the PowerBook100 did not have a locking position or a lighted indicator of its status, and to compensate, the System7 operating system software includes an extension file that causes an icon of the international <b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> symbol (⇪) to appear in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar when <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> is active.|$|E
25|$|<b>Caps</b> <b>lock</b> is {{replaced}} by Shift lock, thus affecting non-letter keys as well. However, there is an ongoing evolution towards a <b>Caps</b> <b>lock</b> key instead of a Shift lock.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} defining (albeit optional) {{feature of}} the Colemak layout {{is the lack of}} a <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> key; an additional Backspace key occupies the position typically occupied by <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> on modern keyboards.|$|E

25|$|Support {{for many}} USB {{devices such as}} cameras, mice, {{external}} keyboards and flash drives is included, utilizing a feature similar to plug-and-play on other operating systems. Like the prototype Cr-48, Chromebooks have a specialized keyboard complete with buttons for opening and controlling multiple browser-windows, {{as well as a}} Web search button which replaces the <b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> key (<b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> being activated by pressing both alt+search).|$|E
25|$|The Cr-48's {{hardware}} design broke convention by replacing certain keys with shortcut keys, {{such as the}} function keys, and replacing the <b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> key with a dedicated search key, which can be changed back to <b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> in the OS's keyboard settings. Google addressed complaints that the operating system offers little functionality when the host device is not connected to the Internet, demonstrated an offline version of Google Docs, and announced a 3G plan that would give users 100MB of free data each month, with additional paid plans available from Verizon.|$|E

25|$|Lock keys lock {{part of a}} keyboard, {{depending}} on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numeric pad. The lock keys include Scroll lock, Num lock (which allows {{the use of the}} numeric keypad), and <b>Caps</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{test for}} whether the {{computer}} has crashed is pressing the <b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> key. The keyboard sends the key code to the keyboard driver {{running in the}} main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the Shift, alt and control state of the keyboard.|$|E
25|$|Alphabetical, numeric, and {{punctuation}} {{keys are}} used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed {{at the same time as}} some modifier keys.|$|E
50|$|When it opened, Mont Park Hospital {{was fitted}} with many {{facilities}} {{far ahead of}} its time such as a gymnasium, electrical apparatus for physiotherapy and a Red Cross rest room. Patients not working were confined to their wards or in airing cages, which were small and overcrowded. Patients were restrained using straight jackets, skull <b>caps,</b> <b>locked</b> boots or padded cells.|$|R
50|$|A {{percussion}} <b>cap</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism styled on the patilla and romanlock pattern miquelets {{was used}} on pistols and sporting guns {{right up to}} the advent of the cartridge firearm. Sculpturing of the hammer in the form of wildlife (lions, dogs, mythical beasts, or fish) was a common practice on these percussion miquelet locks. Miquelets fashioned in this way were particularly well represented by the gunmakers of Eibar.|$|R

25|$|The first {{computer}} keyboards were for mainframe computer data terminals and used discrete electronic parts. The first keyboard microprocessor {{was introduced in}} 1972 by General Instruments, but keyboards have been using the single-chip 8048 microcontroller variant since it became available in 1978. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs, it converts the keystrokes to key codes, and, for a detached keyboard, sends the codes down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to the main processor on the computer motherboard. This serial keyboard cable communication is only bi-directional {{to the extent that}} the computer's electronics controls the illumination of the <b>caps</b> <b>lock,</b> num lock and scroll lock lights.|$|E
25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E

30|$|We {{can measure}} the basic {{maintenance}} work some therbligs. Therefore through cumulating the maintenance therbligs time, the total {{time can be}} gained. The procedure of disassembling APU motor starter {{can be divided into}} 8 parts: going up the operation platform, opening seven <b>cap</b> <b>locks,</b> opening the left side cabin door, opening the right side cabin door, screwing 8 hexagon bolts, screwing APU, moving cables and putting APU to the operation platform.|$|R
30|$|To {{minimise}} these problems, different polyaxial locking plates {{have been}} introduced, extending {{the concept of}} polyaxial screws of spinal fixation systems [14]. These plates allow many options in screw angulation enhancing the possibility of fracture fixation. This versatility allows for a stable osteosynthesis of highly comminuted or osteoporotic fractures. Several technologies exist to obtain variable axis locking such as self-locking bushings or screws with two components where a <b>cap</b> <b>locks</b> the screw in a chosen direction.|$|R
2500|$|SIL International have {{developed}} another standard, {{which is based}} on Tiro, but adds the Niqqud along the home keys. Linux comes with [...] "Israel— Biblical Hebrew (Tiro)" [...] as a standard layout. [...] With this layout, niqqud can be typed without pressing the <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> key.|$|E
2500|$|... iOS 7.1 was {{released}} on March 10, 2014. The update included improvements to the Touch ID fingerprint technology, support for CarPlay, and a fix for a home screen crash issue. It also brought visual updates for the shift and <b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> keys on the keyboard, refined icons for several of Apple's standard apps, and a redesign for {{some aspects of the}} Phone dialer and shutdown screens.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{because the}} shift key {{required}} more force to push (its mechanism was moving {{a much larger}} mass than other keys), and was operated by the little finger (normally the weakest finger on the hand), {{it was difficult to}} hold the shift down for {{more than two or three}} consecutive strokes. The [...] "shift lock" [...] key (the precursor to the modern <b>caps</b> <b>lock)</b> allowed the shift operation to be maintained indefinitely.|$|E

50|$|Ian Donald Jones MNZM (born 17 April 1967 in Whangarei) is {{a former}} New Zealand rugby union player. He played 79 tests for the All Blacks and is the most <b>capped</b> <b>lock</b> and formed {{one of the most}} famous lock pairings in {{international}} rugby, often partnered with Robin Brooke in the All Blacks from 1992 to 1998. What Jones lacked in size he more than made up for in skill, Jones was picked over physically intimidating locks such as Mark Cooksley who was the tallest All Black ever. Jones made his All Black debut Saturday, 16 June 1990 v Scotland at Dunedin. At the time he was 23 years, 60 days old.|$|R
2500|$|Qwpr is a layout which changes only 11 basic {{keys from}} their QWERTY positions, with only 2 of them {{changing}} fingers. Minimak has versions which changes four, six, eight, or twelve keys, all have only 3 keys change finger. These intend to offer {{much of the}} reduced finger movement of Dvorak without the steep learning curve and with an increased ability to remain proficient with a QWERTY keyboard. The Qwpr layout is also designed for programmers and multilingual users, as it uses <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> as a [...] "punctuation shift", offering quicker access to ASCII symbols and arrow keys, {{as well as to}} 15 dead keys for typing hundreds of different glyphs such as accented characters, mathematical symbols, or emoji.|$|E
2500|$|On March 27, 1996, Lexmark's {{contract}} to make keyboards for IBM expired, and Lexmark transitioned its keyboard business to IBM and other vendors. Some of its manufacturing assets {{were sold to}} a group of Lexmark employees, who formed Unicomp. Unicomp still manufactures its version of the Model M (similar to part number 42H1292 but first renamed 42H1292U and subsequently the [...] "Customizer"), as well as other configurations including updated 104- and 105-key layouts; a Unix layout (where the Ctrl and <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> keys and Esc and tilde keys are transposed); models with integrated pointing sticks or trackballs; and POS-specific models such as those with built-in magstripe readers. When Lexmark discontinued keyboard production in March 1996, IBM continued production in Greenock, Scotland and subcontracted production of the Model M13 keyboard (IBM Enhanced Keyboard with TrackPoint II) to Maxi Switch in Mexico. These companies stopped producing Model M's in 1999 and 1998 respectively. Although current Unicomp models may still be purchased, original production models retain their value well among collectors and computer enthusiasts.|$|E
2500|$|Tilt {{and rotate}} {{movements}} are {{transferred to the}} ball carrier (the mechanism that supports the type element), which moves across the page, by two taut metal tapes, one for tilt and one for rotate. The tilt and rotate tapes are both anchored {{to the right side}} of the carrier. [...] They both wrap around separate pulleys at {{the right side of the}} frame; the tilt pulley is fixed, while the rotate pulley is attached to the shift arm, actuated by the Shift and <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> keys. [...] The tapes extend across the machine behind the carrier, and then wrap around two separate pulleys at the left side of the frame. [...] The tilt tape is then anchored to a small, quarter-circle pulley which, through a link, tips the tilt ring (the device to which the type element is connected) to one of four possible locations. [...] The rotate tape is wrapped around a spring-loaded pulley located in the middle of the carrier. [...] The rotate pulley under the tilt ring is connected through a universal joint (called a [...] "dog bone", which it resembles) to the center of the tilt ring. [...] The type element is spring-latched onto that central post. [...] The type element rotates counter-clockwise when the rotate tape is tightened. [...] The spiral [...] "clock" [...] spring underneath the rotate pulley rotates the element in the clockwise direction. [...] As the carrier moves across the page (such as when it returns), the tapes travel over their pulleys, but the spring-loaded pulleys on the ball carrier do not pivot or rotate.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn eukaryotes {{the primary}} target for cAMP, a {{ubiquitous}} second messenger, is cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Understanding how binding and release of cAMP changes the cAMP binding domains and then triggers long-range allosteric responses {{is an important}} challenge. This conformational switching requires structure solutions of cAMP binding domains in cAMP-bound and cAMP-free states. We describe {{for the first time}} a crystal structure of the cAMP binding domains of PKA type Iα regulatory subunit where site A is occupied by cGMP and site B is unoccupied. The structure reveals that the carboxyl terminus of domain B serves as a hydrophobic <b>cap,</b> <b>locking</b> the cyclic nucleotide via its adenine ring into the β-barrel. In the absence of cAMP, the “cap” is released via an extension of the C-terminal helix. This simple hinge mechanism for binding and release of cAMP also provides a mechanism for allosteric communication between sites A and B...|$|R
