50|$|Invoices are {{different}} from receipts. Both invoices and receipts are ways of tracking purchases of goods and services. In general the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>invoices</b> can be {{similar to that of}} receipts including tracking the amount of the sale, calculating sales tax owed and calculating any discounts applied to the purchase. Invoices differ from receipts in that invoices serve to notify customers of payments owed, whereas receipts serve as proof of completed payment.|$|R
50|$|Such {{prepared}} invoice, {{along with}} proper authentication of the seller, is uploaded to the Revenue Authority server (seller's jurisdiction) using DICE protocol for safekeeping and signature processing. Based {{on the information}} provided by the seller, system will apply verifiable electronic signature and send it back {{in the same manner as}} it was received. Seller will include electronic signature received in return to finalize invoice before dispatching it to customer who may verify the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>invoice</b> at any time by checking the signature using Revenue Authority's or DICE's web portal.|$|R
50|$|In case {{customer}} is registered {{outside of the}} seller's jurisdiction, before signing the invoice Revenue Authority will provide notice to the other jurisdiction announcing the customer's identity and <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>invoice</b> using DICE protocol. Given the fact that DICE is being used in another jurisdiction (meaning there is an agreement between two jurisdictions to use DICE protocol and exchange digital keys {{for the purpose of}} secure communication), the received information will be processed to acknowledge positively that {{customer is}} registered in accordance with the applicable Laws, thus the transaction is considered legal. If customer is not registered in the database of the receiving jurisdiction, invoice will not be completed with valid electronic signature.|$|R

We find an empirical relationship between the riskiness of the exchange rate and the fraction <b>of</b> imports <b>invoiced</b> in the importer¡¯s currency, the exporter¡¯s currency, and a third country currency. The higher the volatility of the exchange rate, the larger is the fraction <b>of</b> imports <b>invoiced</b> in the importer¡¯s currency. Consequently, the fraction <b>of</b> <b>invoicing</b> in the exporter¡¯s or a third country currency is inversely related to the volatility of the exchange rate. ...|$|R

The {{state of the art}} of benchmarking of document analysis systems is presented, based on the processing levels: Document Page Segmentation, Text Recognition, Document Classification, and Information Extraction. The restriction to invoices enables and requires a more purposeful, i. e. detailed, targetting of the benchmarking procedures (acquisition of ground truth data, system runs, comparison of data, condensation into meaningful numbers). Therefore the processing <b>of</b> <b>invoices</b> is dissected. The involved data structures are elicited and presented.
