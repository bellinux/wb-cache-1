40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{fidelity}} of coral Sr/Ca for quantitative reconstructions of sea surface temperature variations, we have generated three monthly Sr/Ca time series from Porites corals from the lagoon of Peros Banhos (71 °E, 5 °S, Chagos Archipelago). We find that all three coral Sr/Ca time series are well correlated with instrumental records of sea surface temperature (SST) and air temperature. However, the intrinsic variance of the single-core Sr/Ca time series differs from <b>core</b> <b>to</b> <b>core,</b> limiting their use for quantitative estimates of past temperature variations. Averaging the single-core data improves the correlation with instrumental temperature (r > 0. 7) and allows accurate estimates of interannual temperature variations (~ 0. 35 °C or better). All Sr/Ca time series indicate a shift towards warmer temperatures in the mid- 1970 s, which coincides with the most recent regime shift in the Pacific Ocean. However, {{the magnitude of the}} warming inferred from coral Sr/Ca differs from <b>core</b> <b>to</b> <b>core</b> and ranges from 0. 26 to 0. 75 °C. The composite Sr/Ca record from Peros Banhos clearly captures the major climatic signals in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, i. e. the El Niño–southern oscillation and the Pacific decadal oscillation. Moreover, composite Sr/Ca is highly correlated with tropical mean temperatures (r = 0. 7), suggesting that coral Sr/Ca time series from the tropical Indian Ocean will contribute to multi-proxy reconstructions of tropical mean temperatures...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPhotosynthetic {{membranes}} accommodate {{densely packed}} light-harvesting complexes which absorb light and convey excitation to the reaction center (RC). The {{relationship between the}} fluorescence yield (φ) and the fraction (x) of closed RCs is informative about the probability for an excitation reaching a closed RC to be redirected to another RC. In this work, we have examined in this respect membranes from various bacteria and searched for a correlation with {{the arrangement of the}} light-harvesting complexes as known from atomic force or electron microscopies. A first part of the paper is devoted to a theoretical study analyzing the φ(x) relationship in various models: monomeric or dimeric RC–LH 1 core complexes, with or without the peripheral LH 2 complexes. We show that the simple “homogeneous” kinetic treatment used here agrees well with more detailed master equation calculations. We also discuss the agreement between information derived from the present technique and from singlet annihilation experiments. The experimental results show that the enhancement of the cross section of open RCs due to excitation transfer from closed units varies from 1. 5 to 3 depending on species. The ratio of the <b>core</b> <b>to</b> <b>core</b> transfer rate (including the indirect pathway via LH 2) to the rate of trapping in open units is in the range of 0. 5 to 4. It is about 1 in Rhodobacter sphaeroides and does not increase significantly in mutants lacking LH 2 —despite the more numerous contacts between the dimeric core complexes expected in this case. The connectivity in this bacterium is due in good part to the fast transfer between the two partners of the dimeric (RC–LH 1 –PufX) 2 complex. The connectivity is however increased in the carotenoidless and LH 2 -less strain R 26, which we ascribe to an anomalous LH 1. A relatively high connectivity was found in Rhodospirillum photometricum, although not as high as predicted in the calculations of Fassioli et al. (2010). This illustrates a more general discrepancy between the measured efficiency of <b>core</b> <b>to</b> <b>core</b> excitation transfer and theoretical estimates. We argue that the limited <b>core</b> <b>to</b> <b>core</b> connectivity found in purple bacteria may reflect a trade-off between light-harvesting efficiency and the hindrance to quinone diffusion that would result from too tightly packed LH complexes...|$|E

40|$|We present molecular-line {{observations}} of 94 dark cloud cores {{identified in the}} Pipe nebula through near-IR extinction mapping. Using the Arizona Radio Observatory 12 m telescope, we obtained spectra of these cores in the J= 1 - 0 transition of C 18 O. We use the measured core parameters, i. e., antenna temperature, linewidth, radial velocity, radius and mass, to explore the internal kinematics of these cores {{as well as their}} radial motions through the larger molecular cloud. We find {{that the vast majority of}} the dark extinction cores are true cloud cores rather than the superposition of unrelated filaments. While we identify no significant correlations between the core's internal gas motions and the cores' other physical parameters, we identify spatially correlated radial velocity variations that outline two main kinematic components of the cloud. The largest is a 15 pc long filament that is surprisingly narrow both in spatial dimensions and in radial velocity. Beginning in the Stem of the Pipe, this filament displays uniformly small C 18 O linewidths (dv~ 0. 4 kms- 1) as well as <b>core</b> <b>to</b> <b>core</b> motions only slightly in excess of the gas sound speed. The second component outlines what appears to be part of a large (2 pc; 1000 solar mass) ring-like structure.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the fractional electron abundance, xe, in protostellar cores relies on observations of molecules, such as DCO +, H 13 CO + and CO, and on chemical models to interpret their abundance. Studies of protostellar cores have revealed significant variations of xe from <b>core</b> <b>to</b> <b>core</b> within a range 10 − 8 < xe < 10 − 6. The physical origin of these large variations in xe is not well understood, unless unlikely variations in the cosmic ray ionization rate or ad hoc values of metal depletion are assumed. In this work we explore other potential causes of these variations in xe including core age, extinction and density. We compute numerically {{the intensity of the}} radiation field within a density distribution generated by supersonic turbulence. Taking into account the lines of sight in all directions, the effective visual extinction in dense regions is found to be always much lower than the extinction derived from the column density along a fixed line of sight. Dense cores with volume and column densities comparable to observed protostellar cores have relatively low mass–averaged visual extinction, 2 mag ≤ AV ≤ 5 mag, such that photo–ionization can sometimes be as important as cosmic ray ionization. Chemical models, including gas–grain chemistry and time dependent gas depletion and desorption, are computed for values of visual extinction in the range 2 mag ≤ AV ≤ 6 mag, and for a hydrogen gas density of 10 4 cm − 3, typical of protostellar cores. The models presented here can reproduce some of the observed variations of ion abundance from <b>core</b> <b>to</b> <b>core</b> as the combined effect of visual extinction and age variations.

Within DSM systems, memory consistency is a critical issue since it affects not only the performance but also the correctness of programs. We investigate the scalability of the relaxed consistency models (weak, release consistency) implemented by using transaction counters. Our experimental results compare the average and maximum code, synchronization and data latencies of the two consistency models for various network sizes with regular mesh topologies. The observed latencies rise for both the consistency models as the network size grows. However, the scaling behaviors are different. With the release consistency model these latencies grow significantly slower than with the weak consistency due to better optimization potential by means of overlapping, reordering and program order relaxations. The release consistency improves the performance by 15. 6 % and 26. 5 % on average in the code and consistency latencies over the weak consistency model for the specific application, as the system grows from single <b>core</b> <b>to</b> 64 <b>cores.</b> The latency of data transactions grows 2. 2 times faster on the average with a weak consistency model than with a release consistency model when the system scales from single <b>core</b> <b>to</b> 64 <b>cores...</b>|$|R
