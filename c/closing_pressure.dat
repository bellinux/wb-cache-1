40|$|Objective—Cerebral {{critical}} <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> (CCP) {{has been}} defined as an arterial pressure threshold below which arterial vessels collapse. Hypothetically this is equal to intracranial pressure (ICP) plus the contribution from the active tone of cerebral arterial smooth muscle. The correlation of CCP with ICP, cerebral autoregulation, and other clinical and haemodynamic modalities in patients with head injury was evaluated. Method—intracranial pressure, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity were recorded daily in ventilated patients. Waveforms were processed to calculate CCP, the tran-scranial Doppler-derived cerebral au-toregulation index (Mx), mean arterial pressure (ABP), intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Results—Critical <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> re-flected the time related changes in ICP during plateau and B waves. Overall correlation between CCP and ICP was mild but significant (R= 0. 41; p< 0. 0002). The mean diVerence between ABP and CCP correlated with CPP (R= 0. 57, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) for predic-tion 25 mm Hg). The diVerence between CCP and ICP, described previously as proportional to arterial wall tension, cor-related with the index of cerebral au-toregulation Mx (p< 0. 0002) and CPP (p< 0. 0001). However, by contrast with the Mx index, CCP-ICP was not significantly correlated with outcome after head injury. Conclusion—Critical <b>closing</b> <b>pressure,</b> al-though sensitive to variations in ICP and CPP, cannot be used as an accurate estimator of these modalities with accept-able confidence intervals. The diVerence CCP−ICP significantly correlates with cerebral autoregulation, but it lacks the power to predict outcome after head injury...|$|E

40|$|Lung {{recruitment}} and derecruitment {{contribute significantly to}} variations in the elastance of the respiratory system during mechanical ventilation. However, the decreases in elastance that occur with deep inflation are transient, especially in acute lung injury. Bates and Irvin (8) proposed {{a model of the}} lung that recreates time-varying changes in elastance as a result of progressive {{recruitment and}} derecruitment of lung units. The model is characterized by distributions of critical opening and <b>closing</b> <b>pressures</b> throughout the lung and by distributions of speeds with which the processes of opening and closing take place once the critical pressures have been achieved. In the present study, we adapted this model to represent a mechanically ventilated mouse. We fit the model to data collected in a previous study from control mice and mice in various stages of acid-induced acute lung injury (3). Excellent fits to the data were obtained when the normally distributed critical opening pressures were about 5 cmH 2 O above the <b>closing</b> <b>pressures</b> and when the hyperbolically distributed opening velocities were about an order of magnitude greater than the closing velocities. We also found that, compared with controls, the injured mice had markedly increased opening and <b>closing</b> <b>pressures</b> but no change in the velocities, suggesting that the key biophysical change wrought by acid injury is dysfunction of surface tension at the air-liquid interface.

40|$|Background: Residual neuromuscular {{blockade}} {{increases the}} risk to develop postoperative complications. The authors hypothesized that minimal neuromuscular blockade (train-of-four [TOF] ratio 0. 5 - 1) increases upper airway collapsibility and impairs upper airway dilator muscle compensatory responses to negative pharyngeal pressure challenges. Methods: Epiglottic and nasal mask pressures, genioglossus electromyogram, respiratory timing, and changes in lung volume were measured in awake healthy volunteers (n = 3 D 15) before, during (TOF = 3 D 0. 5 and 0. 8 [steady state]), and after recovery of TOF to unity from rocuronium-induced partial neuromuscular blockade. Passive upper airway <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> (negative pressure drops, random order, range + 2 to - 30 cm H 2 O) and pressure threshold for flow limitation were determined. Results: Upper airway <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> increased (was less negative) significantly from baseline by 54 +/- 4. 4 % (means +/- SEM), 37 +/- 4. 2 %, and 16 +/- 4. 1 % at TOF ratios of 0. 5, 0. 8, and 1. 0, respectively (P < 0. 01 vs. baseline for any level). Phasic genioglossus activity almost quadrupled in response to negative (- 20 cm H 2 O) pharyngeal pressure at baseline, and this increase was significantly impaired by 57 +/- 44 % and 32 +/- 6 % at TOF ratios of 0. 5 and 0. 8, respectively (P < 0. 01 vs. baseline). End-expiratory lung volume, respiratory rate, and tidal volume did not change. Conclusion: Minimal neuromuscular blockade markedly increases upper airway <b>closing</b> <b>pressure,</b> partly by impairing the genioglossus muscle compensatory response. Increased airway collapsibility despite unaffected values for resting ventilation may predispose patients to postoperative respiratory complications, particularly during airway challenges.

40|$|Introduction: Dysfunction of Eustachian tube (ET) and the {{associated}} pressure equalizing problems are concerning patients especially in flying and diving. The effect of pressure-regulating earplugs (PREP) on complaints while flying has been evaluated. In addition, the effectivity of laser Eustachian tuboplasty (LETP) has been investigate in a pressure chamber. Methods: 60 patients were included in 3 studies. All of them were examined in a hyperbaric pressure chamber with continuous impedance measurement. In the PREP-study 21 patients were examined double-blind with and without PREP in the pressure chamber. In the LETP- (n= 30) and the diver-longterm-study (n= 9) the ET function before and after LETP were measured. ET opening pressure, ET <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> and ET opening duration were evaluated pre- and postoperatively. In the diver-longterm-study also longterm results after 3 - 4 years were collected. Results: PREP-study: Evidence of ET dysfunction was found in twice as many patients with the impedance method in the pressure chamber compared to tympanometry and Valsava test. The number of pressure-equalizing maneuvers did not differ significantly. Patients reported a significantly better subjective state on the visual analogue scale with than without PREP (p < 0. 003). LETP-study: Bevore LETP, 17 patients showed a blocked pattern in pressure chamber testing. Postoperatively, 13 patients of this group showed an improved ET function with a restored normal opening pattern (p < 0. 001). The ET <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> was reduced from 6. 24 ± 3. 46 mbar preoperatively to 4. 06 ± 2. 36 mbar postoperatively (p < 0. 013). Diver-longterm-study: Preoperatively 5 divers showed a blocked pattern in pressure chamber testing. In 4 of them a normal opening pattern was restored postoperatively (p < 0. 001). The ET <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> was reduced significant from 7. 40 ± 1. 52 mbar preoperatively to 2. 85 ± 1. 11 mbar postoperatively (p < 0. 005). In the long-term, all subjects reported a restored ability for pressure equalization and 7 of 9 were diving again. Conclusion: A combination of Valsalva manoeuver, tympanometry and continuous impedance measurement in the pressure chamber identifies more patients with pressure equalizing problems than only the both first mentioned ENT-routine diagnostics allone. Although use of PREP {{showed no signs of}} improving ET function, it did significantly improve individual subjective state during sudden pressure changes. Patients with ET dysfunction seem to benefit from LETP. The improvment of ET function can be proven by impedance measurement in the pressure chamber and with determination of ET <b>closing</b> <b>pressure.</b> Divers with ET dysfunction seem to dive after LETP without problems or especially pain...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} pressure-flow characteristics at physiologic {{flow rates}} in vitro and in vivo in rabbits for Ahmed, Baerveldt, Krupin disk, and OptiMed glaucoma implants. The Molteno dual-chamber implant also was evaluated in vivo only. METHODS: Five samples of each glaucoma implant were studied. Baerveldt implants were ligated partially for in vitro testing. Opening and <b>closing</b> <b>pressures</b> in air or after immersion in {{balanced salt solution}} or plasma were evaluated for the valved devices (Ahmed and Krupin). Pressures were measured in vitro and in vivo in normal rabbits at flow rates preset at between 2 and 25 microliters/minute after the tubes were connected to a closed manometric system. In vivo measurements were made 24 hours after implantation. Resistance to flow was calculated using Poiseuille's equation after at least three separate flow rate readings. RESULTS: In air, the Ahmed and Krupin valves had opening pressures of 9. 2 +/- 3. 4 and 7. 2 +/- 0. 6 mmHg and <b>closing</b> <b>pressures</b> of 5. 2 +/- 0. 9 and 3. 9 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively. Neither opening nor <b>closing</b> <b>pressures</b> could be determined when Ahmed and Krupin valves were immersed. In vitro, the Ahmed and OptiMed devices had higher pressures than did other devices at a 2 -microliters/minute flow rate of balanced salt solution. During perfusion with plasma, only the OptiMed device maintained higher pressures than with balanced salt. With all devices, pressures fell rapidly to zero after flow was stopped. The OptiMed device demonstrated the highest resistance values. In vivo, the Ahmed device provided pressures of 7. 5 +/- 0. 8 mmHg and the OptiMed device gave pressures of 19. 6 +/- 5. 6 mmHg at a 2 -microliters/minute flow rate. After 15 minutes of flow shutdown, the OptiMed implant maintained pressures of 7. 1 +/- 1. 1 mmHg. The Baerveldt (nonligatured), Krupin, and Molteno dual-chamber implants had similar resistances and pressures in vivo. Pressures with all devices in vivo fell rapidly to zero after conjunctival wound disruption. CONCLUSION: Neither the Ahmed nor Krupin devices had demonstrable opening or <b>closing</b> <b>pressures</b> when tested in vitro immersed in balanced salt solution or plasma. With all devices, pressures were higher in vivo than in vitro due to tissue-induced resistance around the explant.
