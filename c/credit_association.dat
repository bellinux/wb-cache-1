Accordingly, we determined that <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> compete with each other in regional lending markets by using two different proxies for the market share held by <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> in a region. The first proxy was the credit associations’ share of all deposits in a region and the second was the credit associations’ share of all branch offices in a region. In addition, <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> that face more intense competition from regional banks in regional markets were found to face more intense competition from other <b>credit</b> <b>associations.</b> ...|$|R

In the article a skeleton program of mutual pecuniary aid as well as adjusted forms of organization and the technique of co-operative banking system are presented on the basis of the best experiences gained by the co-operative <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> in the district of Poznań. By putting the experiences into practice the co-operative <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> may be given a stimulus to a more effective employment of the population's resources and the co-operative resources to activize local communities in accord with the public interest while training them up to be thrifty united and disciplined.

40|$|Housing loans {{have been}} the most dynamic bank lending {{activity}} for the last twenty years. Significant changes have occurred in this period to make the mortgage market more flexible and highly competitive. Prior to the reforms in the 80 s it was a very restricted market that was limited to the savings banks and the Spanish Mortgage Bank. Many restrictions have since been removed and new agents have been allowed to enter the market. Nevertheless, families have taken proximity and pleasant treatment into consideration along with the financial terms when choosing where to take out a mortgage. Thus, in spite of the efforts of other intermediaries such as foreign banks, most mortgage loan activity takes place in retail banking services and especially in the savings banks. Within this context, co-operative <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> have firmly gained ground in the market in the face of strong competition.
