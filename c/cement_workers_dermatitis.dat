40|$|BACKGROUND: Due {{to recent}} {{industrialization}} and inadequately protected workers {{or in other}} words poor supervision on constructive workers habits in our large city of Isfahan cement contact dermatitis is relatively high especially among <b>cement</b> factory <b>workers</b> and constructive personnel. PURPOSES: To investigate the prevalence rate of cement contact <b>dermatitis</b> in <b>cement</b> factory <b>workers</b> in Isfahan. METHODS: A case-control clinical study {{was carried out by}} randomly selecing 150 factory workders and 150 official clerks in a cement factory in Isfahan in 2001. After a complete physical examination, data was recorded in observational checklists. FINDINGS: The percentages of contact dermatitis prevalences in the first and the second groups were 22 &#x 0025; and 5. 3 &#x 0025; respectively. About 60 &#x 0025; of <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> with contact <b>dermatitis</b> were between 30 - 40 years of age. There was a direct relationship with age in both groups of the workers. In the high-exposure group, the hand eczema along was 70 &#x 0025; but in the other group the percentage of involvement was the same in exposed and unexposed anatomical areas. CONCLUSIONS: There was a direct relationship between occurrence and the severity of involvement and duration of contact in the first group. Cent percent of <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> had contact <b>dermatitis</b> after 10 or less years, but the percentage among the other group was 35 &#x 0025;.

40|$|Occupational <b>dermatitis</b> among <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> {{is a major}} {{occupational}} health concern. The two most important occupational hazards for <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> are irritant and allergic cement contact dermatitis. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the severity of occupational cement contact dermatitis and the common allergens among <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 97 <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> from the <b>Cement</b> Workers’ Association of Tainan City and County participated in this study. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate the demographic data and work-related activities of these <b>cement</b> <b>workers.</b> A complete skin examination was conducted, and skin manifestations were assessed by a dermatologist. Allergens from European Standard Tray (Chemotechnique Diagnostic AB, Sweden) with a total of 25 substances were used for patch testing. Results: Our results showed that 65 out of 97 <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> were suffering from occupational cement hand contact dermatitis. The most affected skin area was the hand. Thickening of the dorsal surface of the hand, especially around the metacarpophalangeal joint area, and hyperkeratosis of the palm were the major skin manifestations. The results of the patch test showed that 24 out of 97 were allergic to potassium dichromate, nine were allergic to thiuram mix, nine were allergic to fragrance mix and seven were allergic to cobalt chloride. The final diagnosis, based on the results of the skin examination and the patch test, showed that 43 of 97 <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> had irritant <b>cement</b> contact dermatitis and 22 had allergic cement contact dermatitis. Conclusion: We conclude that occupational cement hand <b>dermatitis</b> among <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> is an important and severe issue in Taiwan, and the most common allergens among <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> are potassium dichromate, thiuram mix, fragrance mix and cobalt chloride. The high positive rate of chromium hypersensitivity among <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> reflects the urgency to regulate the addition of ferrous sulfate to cement in Taiwan...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{measure the}} impact on {{survival}} of being exposed to asbestos cement dust. METHODS: Survival of 866 asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> and 755 controls was studied with Cox's proportional hazards regression models with age as the basic time variable. The effect of cumulative exposure up {{to the age of}} 40 was investigated in an internal analysis of 635 asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> who had dose estimates. RESULTS: The death risk was higher for the asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> than for the controls with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1. 15 (95 % confidence interval was 1. 00 to 1. 31). The increased risk found seemed to be confined to the period 20 - 40 years from start of employment. The estimates of the cohort effect were almost unaffected by adjustment for smoking habits. The estimates of the exposure effect rose with increasing dose (or = 10 f-y/ml: HR = 1. 35, for workers with at least five years of employment), and were higher when restricted only to deaths from malignant or non-malignant respiratory disease. However, none of the point estimates were significantly increased. Median age at death was two years lower in the high than in the low, exposure group. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that even a moderate asbestos exposure may shorten the median duration of life in an exposed population.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} associations between exposure to mineral fibres and dust, and cancer in subsites within the large bowel. DESIGN [...] Pooled retrospective cohort studies. SUBJECTS AND SETTINGS [...] Blue collar workers, employed {{for at least one}} year in different trades; asbestos <b>cement</b> or <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> (n = 2507), other industrial workers (n = 3965), and fishermen (n = 8092). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs, national reference rates) were calculated for cause specific cancer morbidity between 1958 and 1989. The observation period began 15 years after first employment. RESULTS [...] The asbestos <b>cement</b> and <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> had a slightly increased risk of colorectal cancer (SIR 1. 5; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 1 - 2. 0). This was due to an increase only in the right part of the colon (SIR 2. 5; 95 % CI 1. 6 - 3. 8). The ratio of right (7 th revision of the International Classification of Diseases ICD- 7) 1530 - 1531) /left (ICD- 7 1532 - 1533) colon cancer among the asbestos <b>cement</b> and <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> of 4. 8 differed significantly from the ratio both among the other blue collar workers (0. 4) and among the fishermen (1. 5). As the sensitivity and accuracy was insufficient, mortality data did not show the excess of cancers in the right part of the colon. CONCLUSIONS [...] An increased incidence of cancer in the right part of the colon was evident in the asbestos <b>cement</b> and <b>cement</b> <b>workers.</b> The distribution of cancers within the colon was noticeably different from that in other blue collar workers, indicating that our findings cannot be explained by socioeconomic confounding factors.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To verify in vivo whether lung cinescintigraphy {{confirms}} {{the effect of}} asbestos on the patency of the smallest airways and on the efficiency of mucociliary clearance in asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>workers.</b> METHODS: 39 male subjects were examined: 30 asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> and nine workers never exposed to occupational respiratory irritants. All subjects had a chest radiograph (International Labour Organisation (ILO) 1980); standard questionnaire on chronic bronchitis; spirometry; arterial blood gas analysis; carbon monoxide transfer factor (TLcosb); pulmonary O 2 and CO 2 ductances (DuO 2, DuCO 2); electrocardiogram; and lung cinescintigraphy after radioaerosol inhalation for the measurement of mucociliary clearance time in vivo in the smallest ciliated airways and {{for the assessment of}} radioaerosol deposition in alveoli (alveolar deposition index). RESULTS: Apart from nine non-exposed subjects, the 30 asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> were so classified on the basis of chest radiography: nine of them as healthy exposed, 10 with pleural plaques, and 11 with asbestosis. The four groups had similar ages, work seniority, and smoking habits. Exercise dyspnoea was significantly more frequent in asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>workers.</b> Lung function variables of workers with effects related to asbestos were significantly lower than the other two groups. The PaO 2, TLcOsb and DuO 2 mean values were significantly lower in exposed workers than non-exposed. The mean PacO 2 value was significantly higher in the asbestosis group than in the other three groups. Workers with effects related to asbestos showed a significantly lower alveolar deposition index and a significantly higher mucociliary clearance time than the other two groups. Subjects with asbestosis showed similar differences from those with pleural plaques. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cinescintigraphy confirms in vivo the effects of asbestos on bronchiolar and alveolar patency and on efficiency of mucociliary clearance in the smallest ciliated airways. Finally, lung cinescintigraphic variables are able to discriminate workers with asbestosis from those with pleural plaques...|$|R

This study investigated causes of deaths from cancer of respiratory tract among <b>cement</b> <b>workers.</b> Methods The deaths of the Greek <b>Cement</b> <b>Workers</b> Compensation Scheme were analyzed covering the period 1969 - 1998. All respiratory, lung, laryngeal and urinary bladder cancer proportionate mortality were calculated for cement production, maintenance, and office <b>workers</b> in the <b>cement</b> industry. Mortality from urinary bladder cancer {{was used as an}} indirect indicator of the confounding effect of smoking. Results Mortality from all respiratory cancer was significantly increased in <b>cement</b> production <b>workers</b> (PMR[*]=[*] 1. 91; 95 % CI 1. 54 to 2. 33). The proportionate mortality from lung cancer was significantly elevated (PMR[*]=[*] 2. 05; 95 % CI 1. 65 to 2. 52). A statistically significant increase in proportionate mortality due to respiratory (PMR[*]=[*] 1. 7; 95 % CI 1. 2 to 2. 34). and lung cancer (PMR[*]=[*] 1. 67; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 15 - 2. 34) among maintenance workers has been observed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} mortality from {{lung cancer}} {{and the risk}} attributable to asbestos separately for asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> and for the general (non-occupationally exposed) population {{in the town of}} Casale Monferrato, where the largest Italian asbestos cement factory had been in operation in 1907 - 86. According to cancer registry data, in the same town the incidence of malignant mesothelioma in the general population is about 10 times higher than in comparable Italian provinces. METHOD: Decedents from lung cancer in 1989 - 95 were nominally identified in the list of decedents kept at the Local Health Authority of Casale Monferrato. Workers in the asbestos cement factory have been identified with a search in the nominal list of workers and the same was done for the wives of asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>workers.</b> These lists have already been used in cohort studies. Sensitivity and specificity of the linkage procedure with occupational activity in asbestos cement production have been evaluated in a previous study. Population at risk was estimated on the basis of official figures and on the results of the cohort study of asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>workers.</b> RESULTS: 227 deaths from lung cancer were included (184 men and 43 women). Among the asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> mortalities were 234. 0 x 100, 000 person-years among men and 35. 5 among women. Corresponding figures in the general (non- occupationally exposed) population in Casale Monferrato were 80. 6 and 18. 7. The rates in the general population were not higher than {{in the rest of the}} region. Attributable risk (AR) among the asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>workers</b> (and wives) is 67. 5 % (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 56. 8 to 78. 2) for men and 51. 3 % (95 % CI 14. 9 to 87. 8) among women. Population AR to occupational or paraoccupational exposure in the asbestos cement production is 18. 3 % (95 % CI 11. 1 to 25. 6) among men and 10. 1 % (95 % CI 0 to 24. 6) among women. CONCLUSION: This work did not show an increase in mortality from lung cancer for the population not exposed occupationally, but a large excess was found among men and women occupationally exposed in asbestos cement production. The total burden of lung cancer due to occupational exposure to asbestos may be underestimated, as only occupational exposure in asbestos cement production was taken into consideration. Nevertheless even a single factory can be responsible for a considerable proportion of deaths from lung cancer in a population...|$|R
