500|$|MTV {{said that}} [...] "Miles Away", the third single from the album, {{was the most}} deceptively simple track because {{although}} it appeared straightforward on the surface, {{it had a lot}} of technical tricks underneath it. The song departs from the dance theme of the album and deals with the difficulties of long-distance relationships. [...] "Miles Away" [...] is a melancholy electronic ballad, which, according to Madonna is autobiographical, and is inspired by her then husband Guy Ritchie. The relationship themed lyrics continue in the next track [...] "She's Not Me", which talks about Madonna being emulated by another woman, hence she utters the line [...] "She started dressing like me and talking like me, It freaked me out, She started <b>calling</b> <b>you</b> {{up in the middle of}} the night, What's that about?" ...|$|E

Microsoft offers a diagnostic tool {{that can be}} used to hide updates and prevent them from being reinstalled, but only after they had been already installed, then uninstalled without rebooting the system. Tom Warren of The Verge felt that, given web browsers such as Google Chrome had already adopted such an automatic update system, such a requirement would help to keep all Windows10 devices secure, and felt that [...] "if you're used to family members <b>calling</b> <b>you</b> for technical support because they've failed to upgrade to the latest Windows service pack or some malware disabled Windows Update then those days will hopefully be over." ...|$|E
500|$|The Virginian, {{a seminal}} 1902 western novel by Owen Wister, took {{the side of}} the wealthy ranchers, {{creating}} a myth of the Johnson County War, but bore little resemblance to a factual account of the actual characters and events. Jack Schaefer's popular 1949 novel Shane treated themes associated with the Johnson County War and took {{the side of the}} settlers. The 1953 film The Redhead from Wyoming, starring Maureen O'Hara, dealt with similar themes; in one scene Maureen O'Hara's character is told, [...] "It won't be long before they're <b>calling</b> <b>you</b> Cattle Kate." [...] In the 1968 novel True Grit by Charles Portis, the main character, Rooster Cogburn, was involved in the Johnson County War.

500|$|Los Angeles Times Ann Powers {{called it}} [...] "a {{waterfall}} of mixed emotions enfolding a sunlit morning-after," [...] and [...] "the most emotionally vulnerable ballad Jackson's recorded in years." [...] Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music {{wrote that the}} song [...] "proves that ballads don't have to be inane and that she doesn't have to spell out exactly where she wants it and how to be sexy." [...] Glenn Gamboa from Newsday praised the track, writing {{that it could be}} one of her best songs ever. Caroline Sullivan, writing for The Guardian, simply wrote that [...] "Can't B Good" [...] is completely lovely. Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club called it a [...] "majestic" [...] song produced by Ne-Yo. Tom Young of BBC Music called it [...] "a potential diamond." [...] For Nick Levine from Digital Spy, the song was created to recall classic Jackson ballads like [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] (1990) and [...] "Let's Wait Awhile" [...] (1987), but failed to do so, due to its lack of melody. Chad Grischow of IGN was less favorable, calling it [...] "cheesy late-eighties ballad, featuring wafer-thin breathy vocals that sounds like someone <b>calling</b> <b>you</b> to their hospital bed rather than the bedroom." ...|$|E

500|$|Zur's {{compositions}} {{frequently are}} focused on full orchestras, choir and, in some games like Prince of Persia, ethnic instruments like Arabic flutes and the woodwind duduk. He has often collaborated with the Northwest Sinfonia orchestra from Seattle, though he has on occasion used other orchestras. Whenever Zur works with a real orchestra, he always conducts it himself. He has named some of his musical influences as classical artists such as Sergey Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, and Beethoven, movie composers like John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith, and jazz artists like George Gershwin and Henry McFeeny. While he would one day like to compose music {{not intended to be}} part of a larger piece of media, he finds that the pressure of a deadline and the feedback from the developers are crucial in his development process. He feels that his music sounds best when it is in the context given by the media it was made for, though he feels that performances of the music by itself transforms it [...] "from just a soundtrack to an art form on its own". Zur sometimes collaborates with other musicians while composing his game soundtracks; for example, he worked with Florence and the Machine to create a unique rendition of [...] "I’m Not <b>Calling</b> <b>You</b> A Liar" [...] for the Dragon Age II soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Hidden Place", which {{features}} a soprano section and strings, [...] "over {{the top of a}} warm, intimate melody". Michael Hubbard of musicOMH felt the track was reminiscent of Homogenics [...] "Hunter", but less focused on the beats. NME called it progressive folk, while Drowned in Sound wrote it was electro. Björk sings about [...] "how two people can create a paradise just by uniting", as she intones: [...] "I'm so close to tears/And so close to/Simply <b>calling</b> <b>you</b> up/And simply suggesting/We go to that hidden place". [...] "Cocoon" [...] is [...] "based around an exploratory bassline and beats that sound like fingertips on skin". Discussing the glitch nature of the track, Björk said, [...] "when you take technology and use the areas where it breaks, where it's faulty, you're entering a mystery zone where you can't control it". Lyrically revolving around making love, the song alternates between metaphors like [...] "Who would have known/That a boy like him/Would have entered me lightly/Restoring my blisses", and explicit lines such as [...] "He slides inside/Half awake, half asleep" [...] and [...] "Gorgeousness/He's still inside me". According to Michael Cragg of The Guardian, the song [...] "best represents the album's sense of heavy-lidded, post-coital hibernation". Björk sings a breathy, [...] "whispered, near-cracking falsetto" [...] on the track.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH {{said that the}} song was [...] "probably the best thing here [...]" [...] He also complimented the [...] "brilliant bridge" [...] and {{the ending of the}} song where the caller gets through to her voicemail. Popjustice gave the song a positive review: [...] "It's a little bit like Gwen's 'What You Waiting For?' meets Timbaland's 'The Way I Are' meets about fifty other things... The structure's quite exciting... there is something tumultuously brilliant about Beyoncé's contribution that makes everything seem fine and as if it was the plan all along." [...] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters said that [...] "The much talked-about Beyoncé collaboration 'Telephone', which—with its double-time beat and rapid-fire verses—proves {{to be one of the}} most adrenaline-pumped songs that Gaga has yet crafted, the whole thing feeling like it's about to veer of [...] the tracks at any moment simply due to the giddy excitement shared between the two divas, easily turning it into the unquestioned highlight of The Fame Monster". Mikael Woods from Los Angeles Times felt that [...] "Telephone" [...] is [...] " [...] a carefully considered meditation on how annoying it is when a dude keeps <b>calling</b> <b>you</b> while you're throwing down at the club." [...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone." ...|$|E
