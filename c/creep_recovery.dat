40|$|ABSTRACT: The present work {{reports a}} {{discrete}} stress-dependent, complex compliance spectra method {{that may be}} used to predict the mechanical response of nonlinear viscoelastic polymers during <b>creep</b> and <b>recovery</b> processes.

The new method is applied to a set of microcellular polycarbonate materials with differing relative density. The nonlinear viscoelastic characteristics of a microcellular polycarbonate material system are very sensitive to relative density and therefore, this material system is a particularly difficult modeling challenge.

Off-axis <b>creep</b> <b>recovery</b> {{behavior}} after complete unloading during creep at {{a constant}} stress is examined for a unidirectional T 800 H/ 3631 carbon/epoxy composite laminate at high temperature. Creep and <b>creep</b> <b>recovery</b> tests are performed on plain coupon specimens with four kinds of fiber orientations: 10, 30, 45 and 90 °. It is observed that the creep strain appeared at a high stress does not completely recover after full removal of the creep stress, indicating that an irrecoverable creep strain has developed under the prior constant stress loading. Variable stress creep simulations are attempted using the modified kinematic hardening model for homogenized anisotropic inelastic composites in which an accelerated change in kinematic hardening over a certain range of viscoplastic strain is considered.

40|$|The {{intervertebral}} disc faces high compressive forces during daily activities. Axial compression induces creeping fluid loss and reduction in disc height. With degeneration, disc fluids and height are progressively lost, altering biomechanics. It {{is assumed that}} this reduction of fluids {{is caused by a}} decline of osmolality within the disc due to proteoglycan depletion. Here we investigate the isolated effect of a reduction in osmosis on the biomechanical properties of the {{intervertebral disc}}. Continuous diurnal loading was applied to healthy caprine intervertebral discs in a loaded disc culture system for a total of 6 days. We increased testing bath osmolality with two doses of polyethylene-glycol (PEG), thereby reducing the osmotic gradient between the disc and the surrounding fluid. This way we could study the isolated effect of reduced osmosis on axial creep, without damaging the disc. We evaluated: daily <b>creep</b> and <b>recovery,</b> recovery time-constants and compressive stiffness. Additionally, we investigated water content. There was a strong dose-dependent effect of PEG concentration on water content and axial creep behaviour: disc height, amplitude and rate of <b>creep</b> and <b>recovery</b> were all significantly reduced. Axial compressive stiffness of the disc was not affected. Reduction of water content and amplitude of <b>creep</b> and <b>recovery</b> showed similarity to degenerative disc biomechanics.
