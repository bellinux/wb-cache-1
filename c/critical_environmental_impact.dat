40|$|Background:A <b>critical</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> of the {{petroleum}} industry is the contamination of soil by oil {{and other related}} products which are highly toxic and exhibit molecular recalcitrance. Therefore, this study focused on investigating {{the total amount of}} petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) in soil of urban fuel stations in Hamedan City, Iran. Methods:Thirteen high traffic urban fuel stations were selected and random soil samples were collected from surface soils at selected fuel stations. The physical and chemical proper-ties of the soil samples were determined in the laboratory. The concentration of TPHs in soils was determined by GC/MC. Results: Results showed that concentration of TPHs in all stations was more than the stand-ard level in soil (2000 mg kg- 1). The minimum and maximum TPHs concentration observed in No. 5 and No. 13 fuel station, respectively. Conclusion: The results showed that spillage in urban fuel stations has clear effect on the content of TPH in soil, as concentration TPH in all of fuel stations was in the upper limit of the standard levels in soil.. Soil pollution with petroleum hydrocarbons has clear effects on soil biological, chemical and physical characteristics and results in decreasedg food elements, productivity and soil plant productions. ...|$|E
40|$|During a 1 -year study (‘‘Fine dust’’ Project) {{funded by}} the Lazio {{regional}} government (Italy), about 1000 daily PM 10 and PM 2. 5 samples collected from six sites in the region were subjected to chemical fractionation based on differences in elemental solubility. In this way, {{it was possible to}} achieve meaningful characterization of the elemental composition of individual samples. For most of the investigated elements, we found significant differences between the extracted and the mineralized residual fraction. In general, fine particulate was best characterized by the composition of the extracted fraction, while coarse particles from traffic-related sources were best characterized using residues. For several metals (Cd, Pb, Sn, Sb and V) having a <b>critical</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact,</b> this result was particularly clear. The application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and receptor modelling (PCR) to the data set allowed us to evidence the enhancement of selectivity towards different emission sources that is obtained when chemical fractionated data are considered instead of total element content. Chemical fractionation seems to generate very selective markers for specific emission sources and in particular for re-suspended road dusts, one of the main factors responsible for the increase of elemental concentrations in urban areas...|$|E

A polluted soil by crude oil {{at the bank of}} produced water pit at a studied oilfield has been chosen as a case study area. A typical soil sample has been prepared from a mixing of twenty four contaminated soil samples that have been gathered from the top soil at the bank of produced water disposal pit. Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) has been determined for the typical soil sample. Bioremediation study has been conducted, where the typical sample was divided into five controlled soil cells. Four cells have treated by biosurfactant in a certain concentration (0. 05 %, 0. 5 %), and volume (2. 5, 10 cm 3 /Kg soil). One cell {{has been used as a}} reference. An evaluation of the ability of aqueous biosurfactant solutions (rhamnolipid), for possible applications in crude oil contaminated soil bioremediation was carried out. The results showed that the biosurfactants were able to remove significant amount of crude oil from the contaminated soil at different solution concentrations and volumes comparing with untreated cell. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been developed and employed to simulate the transport of TPH in the soil around the pit and then simulate the bioremediation process for completely studied area at the mentioned controlled parameters.

In relation to business objectives, the strategic review {{and integration of}} environmental impact reduction {{should be considered a}} best practice development opportunity and a contribution towards longer term sustainability. It should be recognised that environmental impact reduction requirements are often complex and challenging for businesses to implement, especially for those companies lacking the knowledge and internal resources to address these activities. This {{has been found to be}} the case particularly with Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) where flexibility towards new approaches can be strategically more problematic, due to the limitations of available capital and resource.

To cope with the rising public importance of sustainability is a big challenge for all animal farmers and more industrialized operations especially. Confined animal farming operations (CAFO) are seen very critical by many consumers with regard to their sustainability performance, however, the need to improve the sustainability performance especially in the ecological and social dimension exists at both ends of the intensity, i. e., also for the small holder and family owned animal farming models. As in livestock operations, feed and manure contribute the majority to the three most <b>critical</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> categories global warming potential (GWP), acidification (AP) and eutrophication potential (EP) any effort for improvement should start there.

(Engineering Management) Abstract: Solid waste {{generation}} {{has been proven}} to have a significant, if not <b>critical</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact,</b> {{on the economy and}} human health. Therefore, it is crucial to plan very carefully the handling and effective management of solid waste. This study is conducted in the suburban area of Johannesburg, Soweto (Naledi). The primary objective of the City of Johannesburg Waste Management Plan is to incorporate, enhance and upgrade waste management in order to boost its proficiency. (Boitumelong Environmental Consultants (PTY) LTD, 2005). Structured questionnaires with close-ended questions being distributed among the Naledi community, and analysed quantitatively. Informal interviews and discussions with some of the residents, with buyback centres, scavengers and municipal Pikitup solid waste management employees also took place. These are supplemented with some information gathered through physical observations and field visits to the landfill. Results analysed in order to evaluate the level of community awareness, perceptions, constraints and concerns regarding municipal waste management. The results indicate that significant amount of unsorted solid waste in Naledi has always gone to the landfill. Generally, waste generated in most households are disposed of mixed in one plastic bag, before taken to the roadside for weekly collection by Pikitup. However, some households try to separate plastics, tins and bottles; and a private recycler comes and collects that separated waste for selling shows. The results also show that none of the interviewed community members believe that the municipality and residents should actually have to work together in waste management. Total sample indicates that 80 % claim that the community itself is responsible for waste minimisation and only 20 % see it as the municipality’s responsibility. A partnership between the municipality and residents needs to be created and then strengthened to derive at a positive domestic waste management system. If sustainable solid waste management in Naledi is supposed to have a major positive impact, it will require all individuals (the employed, unemployed, youth, professionals and uneducated) to participate. Most importantly, consumers and businesses will have to understand that the time to act is now before the solid waste management problem becomes unmanageable and ultimately has dire consequences to humans and the environment...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Intensive striped catfish {{production}} in the Mekong Delta has, in recent years, raised environmental concerns. We conducted a stakeholder-based screening life cycle assessment (LCA) of the intensive farming system to determine the <b>critical</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> and their causative processes in producing striped catfish. Additional to the LCA, we assessed water use and flooding hazards in the Mekong Delta. Materials and methods The goal {{and scope of the}} LCA were defined in a stakeholder workshop. It was decided there to include all processes up to the exit-gate of the fish farm in the inventory and to focus life cycle impact assessment on global warming, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, and marine (MAET) and freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity (FWET). A survey was used to collect primary inventory data from 28 farms on fish grow-out, and from seven feed mills. Hatching and nursing of striped catfish fingerlings {{were not included in the}} assessment due to limited data availability and low estimated impact. Average feed composition for all farms had to be applied due to limitation of budget and data availability. Results and discussion Feed ingredient production, transport and milling dominated most of the impact categories in the LCA except for eutrophication and FWET. Most feed ingredients were produced outside Vietnam, and the impact of transport was important. Because of the screening character of this LCA, generic instead of specific inventory data were used for modelling feed ingredient production. However, the use of generic data is unlikely to have affected the main findings, given the dominance of feed {{production in}} all impact categories. Of the feed ingredients, rice bran contributed the most to global warming and acidification, while wheat bran contributed the most to eutrophication. The dominance of both was mainly due to the amounts used. Fishmeal production, transport and energy contributed the most to MAET. The biggest impacts of grow-out farming in Vietnam are on eutrophication and FWET. Water nutrient discharge from grow-out farming was high but negligible compared with the natural nutrient content of the Mekong River. The discharge from all grow-out farms together hardly modified river water quality compared with that before sector expansion. Conclusions Feed production, i. e. ingredient production and transport and milling, remains the main contributor to most impact categories. It contributes indirectly to eutrophication and FWET through the pond effluents. The environmental impact of Pangasius grow-out farming can be reduced by effectively managing sludge and by using feeds with lower feed conversion ratio and lower content of fishery products in the feed. To consider farm variability, a next LCA of aquaculture should enlist closer collaboration from several feed-milling companies and sample farms using their feeds. Future LCAs should also preferably collect specific instead of generic inventory data for feed ingredient production, and include biodiversity and primary production as impact categories...|$|E

40|$|A design can {{be defined}} as {{context-sensitive}} when it achieves effective technical and functional transportation solutions, while preserving and enhancing natural environments and minimizing impacts on local communities. Traffic noise {{is one of the most}} <b>critical</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of transportation infrastructure and it affects both humans and ecosystems. Tire/pavement noise is caused by a set of interactions at the contact patch and it is the predominant source of road noise at the regular traffic speeds. Wearing course characteristics affect tire/pavement noise through various mechanisms. Furthermore, acoustic performance of road pavements varies over time and it is influenced by both aging and temperature. Three experimentations have been carried out to evaluate wearing course characteristics effects on tire/pavement noise. The first study involves the evaluation of skid resistance, surface texture and tire/pavement noise of an innovative application of multipurpose cold-laid microsurfacing. The second one involves the evaluation of the surface and acoustic characteristics of the different pavement sections of the test track of the Centre for Pavement and Transportation Technology (CPATT) at the University of Waterloo. In the third study, a set of highway sections have been selected in Southern Ontario with various types of pavements. Noise measurements were carried out by means of the Statistical Pass-by (SPB) method in the first case study, whereas in the second and in the third one, Close-proximity (CPX) and the On-Board Sound Intensity (OBSI) methods have been performed in parallel. Test results have contributed to understand the effects of pavement materials, temperature and aging on tire/pavement noise. Negligible correlation was found between surface texture and roughness with noise.

This study was agreed upon by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism of Namibia with the help of funding from DANCED. The study is the follow up of an environmental baseline report on the Erongo region in Namibia. The baseline report was commisioned to gather data on the region which would assist the creation of an Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan. This baseline report was undertaken by the whole MPhil class as a group exercise. Individual dissertations were then carried out by the members of the Mphil class. The students had to choose topics that were relevant to the study area. This study is one of these dissertations. The study was guided by the principles of Integrated Water Resources Management and the need to be of use in the planning process for water resource utilisation in the study area. To achieve this, the Integrated Environment Management theory is used together with the principles of Integrated Water Resource Management. This will ensure that the study * Uses a broad definition of the environment so as to identify all key opportunities and constraints of the water sector. * Would help towards the creation of a plan to manage the water sector in order to optimise the benefits of the sector while at the same time minimising or mitigating the financial, environmental and social costs.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this book, engaged {{environmental}} citizenship, is a 'big idea'. It raises many issues about democracy; governance; consumer society; how people, their environments and ecology are connected; {{and how we}} can take better account of ecological realities and minimise <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts.</b> <b>Environmental</b> and natural resource issues need to be addressed at a range of scales and by many different people. They can seldom be solved without concerted, coordinated and cooperative action. Some people who become involved do so in a professional capacity. Others are involved because of the citizenship obligations they feel and their care for the common good. Many government programs rely on the voluntary expression of environmental or corporate citizenship, as do community-based environmental movements. What then do we mean by 'environmental citizens'? How and why do people and organisations become these kinds of citizens? How can they engage with <b>critical</b> <b>environmental</b> issues and make a difference? What gets in their way? These are the kinds of questions this book addresses...|$|R
