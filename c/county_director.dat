5|$|Lawton married Rosaleen May Kavanagh in January 1941; the {{marriage}} bore one child, Amanda. Rosaleen never watched Lawton play football during their ten-year marriage. Divorce was granted with a decree nisi in March 1951 after Rosaleen {{was found to}} have committed adultery with Notts <b>County</b> <b>director</b> Adrian Van Geffen; Lawton never saw Amanda again and was not required to pay child support. He would not hear from his daughter until she was convicted of stealing from playwright George Axelrod in 1968, by which time Rosaleen was on her fourth marriage and living in Jamaica. Lawton married second wife Gladys Rose in September 1952, who bore him a son, Thomas Junior. Gladys was also divorced, and her ex-husband cited Lawton as a co-respondent in the divorce proceedings as the pair had begun their relationship whilst Gladys was still married; her family were staunch Catholics, and Gladys was ostracised by her family following her divorce. Gladys had a daughter, Carol, from her previous marriage, who Lawton raised as his own. Thomas Junior went on to play rugby union for Leicester Tigers.|$|E

25|$|When the {{hurricane}} hit North Carolina, it flooded hog waste lagoons and released 25 {{million gallons of}} manure into the rivers, which contaminated the water supply and reduced water quality. Ronnie Kennedy, Duplin <b>County</b> <b>director</b> for environmental health, said that of 310 private wells he had tested for contamination since the storm, 9 percent, or three times the average across eastern North Carolina, had faecal coliform bacteria.

2500|$|The McCains were reunited {{upon his}} release from captivity on March 14, 1973. She was now four inches (ten centimeters) shorter, in a {{wheelchair}} or on crutches, and substantially heavier than when he had last seen her; he was also visibly hampered by his injuries and the mistreatment he had endured from the North Vietnamese. [...] The McCains became frequent guests of honor at dinners hosted by Governor of California Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy Reagan, and the two couples became friendly. Carol McCain was the Clay <b>County</b> <b>director</b> for Reagan's 1976 presidential campaign, as he sought the Republican Party nomination. [...] Her husband's assignments as executive officer, then commanding officer, of A-7 attack squadron VA-174 at NAS Cecil Field saw the couple leading an active social life.

2500|$|The Kalamazoo River oil spill, {{the first}} major dilbit spill, {{occurred}} in June 2010 in Calhoun County, Michigan, and led to [...] "the largest on-land spill in American history" [...] at the time. The pipeline company Enbridge promised to improve safety measures and agreed to pay $177 million to resolve their violations of the Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act including additional fines to cover other spills and clean-up costs after {{an investigation by the}} U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency. Although Enbridge purchased 148 houses plus land and mobile homes along the spill route, some residents did not return to the area. The <b>County</b> <b>Director</b> of Emergency management believed [...] "the majority of people living along the river won't be impacted by the settlement." [...] The city of Battle Creek, Michigan sits {{in the middle of the}} area where damage from the spill occurred; 21.7% of its population is below the poverty line compared to 17.5% for Calhoun County and 18.3% for Kalamazoo County where the oil eventually flowed. The percentage of the population of Michigan below the poverty line is 16.7%. Under section 311(c) of the Clean Water Act, the EPA was able to order Enbridge to finish cleaning up the oil spill. Although no specific regulations for dilbit oil have been proposed, in 2013 when plans for the Keystone XL Pipeline were being developed, the EPA recommended that the State Department “include means to address the additional risks of releases that may be greater for spills of dilbit than other crudes” in response to the damages caused by the Kalamazoo River oil spill. Dilbit oil more readily evaporates from the surface of water than normal crude oil, and after this evaporation occurs the remaining product sinks faster.|$|E
