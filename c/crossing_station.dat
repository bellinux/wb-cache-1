500|$|The station's {{importance}} remained {{through the}} first half of the 20th century. After the Boston & Albany was acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1900, third and fourth tracks were extended in 1907 to South Framingham from Lake <b>Crossing</b> <b>station</b> in Wellesley. In 1911, the NYC considered laying third rail on the main line as far as South Framingham, as well as on the Highland Branch, to allow more frequent electric service on the lines. This would have been the only electrified commuter service directly into Boston, as neither the later-electrified Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad nor experimental electric service on the South Shore Railroad went directly to downtown. However, the plan was abandoned because the infrastructure cost would have exceeded the annual savings on fuel. (In 1959, the Highland Branch received catenary wire and was turned into the Green Line [...] "D" [...] Branch).|$|E

2500|$|The {{station at}} Täsch has been {{particularly}} important since the 1970s, as the end point of {{the part of the}} valley road available for use by motor vehicles. [...] Originally a simple two track <b>crossing</b> <b>station,</b> the Täsch station site was expanded in 1975 by the addition of a separate platform track for shuttle trains to Zermatt. At the same time, the 1891 station building received a modern extension housing a ticket office, while the fields surrounding the station were transformed into parking spaces.|$|E
2500|$|In {{connection}} with that tunnel, the line moves once {{again into the}} valley, and passes the balancing reservoir of a hydroelectric power station at Herbriggen. [...] In close proximity is the <b>crossing</b> <b>station</b> Mattsand, which was built in 1956 {{for the construction of}} the power station, and has been used since 1964 for train crossings. The nearby Herbriggen station has, apart from two platform tracks, a connecting track for a substation associated with the power station. The original station building no longer exists; it was replaced in 1966 by a new structure.|$|E

Ten years later saw {{the creation of the}} Southwest Corridor, a park system with bike and pedestrian trails that lead into the center of Boston. In November 2007, the MBTA awarded Mission Hill Housing Services rights to develop a new 10-story mixed-use building on what is known to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (now the Boston Planning and Development Agency - BPDA) as [...] "Parcel 25", across from the Roxbury <b>Crossing</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Relics {{of closed}} railway lines {{naturally}} diminish and disappear over time {{due to the}} effects of both nature and human development, but in the rural setting of the Far North of New Zealand, some signs of the Donnellys Crossing Section have survived. [...] For much of the line's length, its formation can be seen travelling through the countryside, and a truss bridge over the Kaihu River is still in place. [...] Unfortunately, Kaihu's station building was removed {{at some point in the}} latter half of the 1990s, followed by Donnellys Crossing's station building sometime in the first decade of the 2000s. [...] Donnellys <b>Crossing</b> <b>station</b> was located near a bridge that once carried both road and rail and now remains for the sole use of the road; decking has been removed from the railway side but the framework remains.|$|E
