40|$|We are {{developing}} a cylindrical light diffuser using shape memory polymer (SMP) whose diameter, length, stiffness, and diffusion profile can be tailored to suit a particular application. The cylindrical SMP diffuser is made by casting SMP {{around the end of}} a glass optical fiber using a teflon tube as the casting mold, and abrading the cured SMP surface to cause the light to leak radially outward. The inner diameter of the <b>casting</b> <b>tube</b> is slightly larger than the fiber diameter. A smaller teflon tube is positioned over the fiber (between the fiber and the <b>casting</b> <b>tube)</b> to approximately center the fiber tip in the <b>casting</b> <b>tube.</b> As the SMP cures, it bonds with the optical fiber, creating a strong joint without the need for additional adhesives or mechanical fixtures. A close-up of the SMP-fiber joint and the finished SMP diffuser are shown in Fig. 1. The SMP formulation (developed in-house) was specifically designed to be optically transparent in the visible and near-infrared regions; the spectral absorption of the SMP is shown in Fig. 2. The low absorption is important because (1) it allows the light to travel the length of the diffuser without suffering excessive loss due to absorption and (2) it permits delivery of up to 7 W (300 {micro}m SMP rod on 100 {micro}m core multimode fiber) of laser power into the diffuser without damaging the diffuser. SMP is a good wave guiding material with a refractive index of approximately 1. 5. Also, the SMP stiffness can be tailored from stiff (e. g. acrylic, Ea {approx} 10 {sup 9 } Pa) to very flexible (e. g. silicon rubber, Ea {approx} 10 {sup 6 } Pa). Finally, since SMP can self-actuate, the SMP diffuser could be designed to actuate into a shape other than a straight rod (e. g. 2 D or 3 D coil) ...|$|E

40|$|The FeAl-based {{intermetallic}} alloys are {{of great}} interest because of their low density, low raw material cost, and excellent resistance to high-temperature oxidation, sulfidation, carburization, and molten salts. The applications based on these unique properties of FeAl require methods to melt and cast these alloys into complex-shaped castings and centrifugal <b>cast</b> <b>tubes.</b> This paper addresses the melting-related issues {{and the effect of}} chemistry on the microstructure and hardness of castings. It is concluded that the use of the Exo-Melt{trademark} process for melting and the proper selection of the aluminum melt stock can result in porosity-free castings. The FeAl alloys can be melted and cast from the virgin and revert stock. A large variation in carbon content of the alloys is possible before the precipitation of graphite flakes occurs. Titanium is a very potent addition to refine the grain size of castings.

40|$|Heat {{resisting}} centrifugally <b>cast</b> <b>tubes</b> of HP micro alloy (25 / 35 Cr/Ni, 0. 4 C), are extensively used in steam reforming, {{which is}} currently the dominate technology for hydrogen generation. High pressure of the reacting gases inside the tubes generates high hoop stress in the tube wall and together with the temperature exposure of 900 - 1050 °C causes the tubes to creep along the circumferential direction. The alloy's ability to successfully withstand the severe operating condition is highly dependent on its high temperature creep-rupture behaviour. In recent years a number of manufactures have introduced higher creep-rupture strength versions of the heat resisting HP micro alloy. As a consequence {{they are able to}} offer the centrifugally <b>cast</b> <b>tubes</b> in thinner walls. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} enhance the creep-rupture strength of the alloy produced by Doncasters Paralloy. The immediate objective of this research project is to establish the mechanisms that govern the creep process in this alloy system. Once these mechanisms are better understood further alloy development within the present alloy composition can be achieved. The advanced stages of the project specifically involve studying the influence of microstructure in relation to creep resistance as a function of compositional modifications. ...|$|R

40|$|Weldability (degree {{to which}} defect {{formation}} is resisted when an alloy is welded) {{is an issue}} in fabrication of Ni{sub 3 }Al and Fe{sub 3 }Al. Work to define and improve welding of Ni{sub 3 }Al and Fe{sub 3 }Al alloys is reviewed and progress illustrated by examples of current activities. The cast Ni{sub 3 }Al alloys currently under development, IC 221 M and IC 396 M, have low resistance to solidification cracking and hence difficult to weld. Modifications to the composition of both base alloys and weld deposits,however, increase their resistance to cracking. Crack-free, full-penetration welds were made in centrifugally <b>cast</b> <b>tubes</b> of IC 221 M. Tensile and stress- rupture properties of the weldments compare favorably with base metal properties. Weldability issues have limited the use of Fe{sub 3 }Al alloys to weld overlay applications.

40|$|Deoxidized High Phosphorus (DHP) Copper {{tubes are}} {{frequently}} used in numerous industrial and household applications. To ensure {{the acceptability of}} DHP copper tubes prepared by various industrial processes, {{the quality of the}} DHP copper tubes must be evaluated {{and one of the best}} ways to do so is to examine the microstructure and metallography and quantify grain size. In this paper the authors considered the average grain size of copper tube samples made traditionally as well as by the planetary rolling and CastTube process. Because of the small thickness of the CastTube samples, in certain circumstances traditional methods of grain counting were not plausible and a new procedure for grain counting needed developed. This paper is about the development and evaluation of grain sizes in continuously <b>cast</b> <b>tube</b> samples using both the planimetric procedure (ASTM E 112) and a new method, which will be herby, referred to as the total grain counting method.

Additionally, at three test temperatures (20, 820 and 945 ◦C), the mechanical properties of the cast steel were determined after years of operation under industrial conditions. The tested material was characterised by low, compared with standard requirements, mechanical properties. A relationship between the content of phases (primary and secondary carbides), measured by the methods of quantitative metallography, and the yield strength of the tested material was determined. The yield strength determined at room temperature, and at 820 ◦C and 945 ◦C assumed higher values in samples characterised by a relatively large volume content of phases...|$|R
