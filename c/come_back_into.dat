5|$|Lewis Hamilton was fastest in Q2, two-tenths of {{a second}} ahead of his {{teammate}} Rosberg. In his last qualifying session with Lotus, Romain Grosjean experienced technical difficulties that forced him to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the pits. Even though he was sent out again, {{he was unable to}} set a time, stopping his car at turn seven. His teammate Pastor Maldonado also did not proceed into Q3, as did Jenson Button who missed out by two-tenths {{of a second}}. The two other drivers eliminated were Felipe Nasr for Sauber and Max Verstappen, who was unable to match the time of his teammate Carlos Sainz Jr.|$|E
5|$|Ian Richardson {{was booked}} {{within a minute}} {{of the second half}} {{starting}} for bringing down Kiwomya. Notts County started to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the game; Martindale headed wide, Agana and Richardson both had shots blocked during a goalmouth scramble and Tony Battersby had a shot saved over the crossbar by Jonathan Gould, as County tried to equalise during a 20-minute spell of pressure. Between County's chances, Stallard had the opportunity to double City's lead when he capitalised on a slip from Strodder, but Ward saved his effort. However, City went on to double their advantage on 75 minutes. Ormondroyd, who had replaced the injured Hamilton, flicked on a long pass from Richard Huxford with his first touch. His header went across goal to Stallard who volleyed home. Two minutes after the goal, Martindale fired wide for County after a pass from Agana, and with time running out Finnan's long-range shot was deflected for a corner, but from the resulting set-piece, Richardson shot over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{recessed}} on August 28 for the Labor Day holiday, {{and did not}} <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> session until September 4. The same day, Governor Stanley conferred with Rep. Smith, Delegate Gray, and House Speaker Moore. Their discussion {{focused on}} the Stanley plan's lack of an appeals process for pupil assignments. Stanley agreed to a compromise that would allow an administrative appeal (through an as-yet-to-be-worked-out process), followed by a required appeal to state courts and lower federal courts before any appeal could {{be taken to the}} U.S. Supreme Court. The Stanley plan seemed to suffer a serious blow the following day, however, when the Virginia State Board of Education voted not to endorse the plan. Four members strongly opposed withholding state funds from integrated schools, which led to the negative vote. The board also voted to publicly support the original Gray Commission plan. Meeting with the board after the vote, Governor Stanley discussed the possibility of merging his plan with some sort of pupil assignment plan, so that pupil assignment would be permitted but funds would still be withheld if assignment failed to segregate the schools. Another blow to the Stanley plan came when Colgate W. Darden, Jr., the former governor of Virginia who was now president of the University of Virginia, announced he opposed the Stanley plan and supported the Gray Commission's original proposals.|$|E

25|$|The club {{had fallen}} {{back down to}} the {{regional}} footballing competitions {{for the rest of the}} 1970s, in leagues such as Promozione Campania.

Eventually, the club pulled themselves back up into Serie D (known as Campionato Interregionale at the time) for the 1981–82 season.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the edges}} of south eastern towns, {{perfectly}} good agricultural land often remains uncultivated {{as a result of}} price distortions created by the Metropolitan Green Belt. Indeed, since around 2001 speculators have been buying Green Belt agricultural land, generally adjacent to built up areas, and selling it off in plots, persuading buyers that the government will have to weaken Green Belt protection to solve the housing crisis (see below). It is hard to see when such plots could <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> production.|$|E

A team of soundmen and camera operators kept the camera and microphones in constant motion, as the actors kept to a carefully choreographed set of cues.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Great Doxology, {{while the}} Trisagion is sung, the epitaphios is taken in {{procession}} around the outside the church, and is then returned to the tomb. Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful most bow down under it as they <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ. The epitaphios will lay in the tomb until the Paschal Service early Sunday morning. In some churches, the epitaphios is never left alone, but is accompanied 24 hours a day by a reader chanting from the Psalter.|$|E
25|$|After World War II Essex fell off, {{taking their}} first wooden spoon in 1950. During this period {{it was left}} to Trevor Bailey to do all the pace bowling, and he was often {{unavailable}} due to Test calls, whilst spinner Peter Smith was frequently overbowled until he retired in 1951 – thus a strong batting line-up led by Bailey and Doug Insole could seldom win games. Not until 1957 did Essex <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> {{the top half of the}} table, but Bailey and Barry Knight never had support of sufficient class to permit them to reach the top of the table, even when Robin Hobbs became England's last successful leg-spinner late in the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the party}} {{attendees}} expressed displeasure that the strippers had delivered a very short performance despite being paid several hundred dollars apiece to perform. The team captain who had hired the strippers tried to convince the women to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the house and complete the performance. Both women {{came back into the}} house, but upon being approached by the player who had earlier held up the broomstick, again refused to perform and locked themselves in the bathroom. By this point, a number {{of the party}} guests had left, and the residents of the house, including David Evans, were asking the remaining guests to leave because they were concerned that the noise would cause neighbors to complain to police. When the strippers left the bathroom and the house for the second time, a resident locked the door so they (and the guests who had left the house) could not get back in.|$|E
25|$|The {{birth of}} the modern widely {{accepted}} theory of planetary formation—the Solar Nebular Disk Model (SNDM)—can {{be traced to the}} works of Soviet astronomer Victor Safronov. His book Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets, which was translated to English in 1972, had a long-lasting effect on the way scientists thought about the formation of the planets. In this book almost all major problems of the planetary formation process were formulated and some of them solved. Safronov's ideas were further developed in the works of George Wetherill, who discovered runaway accretion. By the early 1980s, the nebular hypothesis in the form of SNDM had <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> favour, led by two major discoveries in astronomy. First, a number of apparently young stars, such as Beta Pictoris, were found to be surrounded by discs of cool dust, much as was predicted by the nebular hypothesis. Second, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, launched in 1983, observed that many stars had an excess of infrared radiation that could be explained if they were orbited by discs of cooler material.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{had made}} it back to the National Championship {{for the second year in}} a row after losing their best player and {{eventual}} NBA star Gordon Hayward of the Utah Jazz. They were able to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the post season trying to play the cinderella team that they were the previous year. They were seeded as the #8 spot when in fact they had played and won in some very important games that impressed the college basketball sports world. The Butler basketball team was able to pull off upset after upset, game winning shot after game winning shot. Matt Howard made the game winning free throw against The University Pittsburgh after they were losing by one and Matt was fouled 86 feet away from the basket. That wouldn’t be the final of their close calls for this tournament, nor was it their first. Their first game they won by two points, then the close call with Pittsburgh, followed up by an exciting game which led to overtime against Florida in which Butler was able to come out victorious with the win.|$|E
