25|$|Of the {{reduction}} from 2,598 personal injury crashes inside the {{zone in the}} year before the scheme to 1,629 by 2005 TfL estimated that some 40 and 70 injuries may have been avoided annually due to the introduction of the <b>charging</b> <b>zone,</b> with most of the remaining reduction attributed to other changes to the road network favouring its people-moving capacity.|$|E
25|$|The {{congestion}} charge remained an issue during the {{run up to}} the 2008 mayoral election. Boris Johnson, the Conservative Party candidate said he would look at a graduated charging scheme, would consult on whether {{to reduce the size}} of the <b>charging</b> <b>zone</b> and would not introduce the proposed emissions based charging system. Brian Paddick, the Liberal Democrat candidate, suggested exempting delivery vehicles from the charge. Johnson was elected and immediately announced that the emissions based charges would not be implemented.|$|E
25|$|Once {{within the}} <b>charging</b> <b>zone</b> car and {{delivery}} traffic remained unchanged, {{suggesting that the}} journeys made by residents and businesses within the zone were broadly unaffected. Changes to the road network {{over the years has}} made direct comparisons difficult, but TfL suspect that certain routes used heavily by taxis and buses within the zone have seen substantially increased traffic. On some of the boundary roads traffic numbers had increased slightly but congestion and delays were largely unchanged from 2002 levels.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} fee is £11.50 per day if paid by midnight {{on the day}} of travel, £14 if paid {{by the end of the}} following day, or £10.50 if registered with CC Autopay, an automated payment system which records the number of charging days a vehicle travels within the <b>charging</b> <b>zone</b> each month and bills the customer debit or credit card each month. Businesses with six or more vehicles can register with Fleet Auto Pay, and will be charged £10.50 rather than £11.50 per vehicle per day for each vehicle detected within the zone. From 20 May 2013 failure to pay results in the issuance of a Penalty Charge Notice for £130, reduced to £65 if paid within 14 days, but increased to £195 if unpaid after 28 days.|$|E
25|$|Since 1974, Denton has {{consisted}} of three council wards on Tameside Council; Denton North East, Denton South and Denton West, each returning three councillors. The new wards took the same format as the original six Denton UDC wards (which were East, North, South-east, South, South-west and West). There have been minor ward boundary changes in 1982 and 2004. Denton West is the most Conservative-inclined of the three wards, and from 1975 to 1991 had Conservative Party representation. No Conservative councillor has been elected since 1987 in the town, although the party came within 13 votes of re-gaining the Denton West seat in 2008 {{on the back of}} government unpopularity over the abolition of the 10p tax rate and the proposals for a congestion charge in Greater Manchester with the proposed outer <b>charging</b> <b>zone</b> cutting the ward in two.|$|E
25|$|A {{report by}} TfL in early 2007 {{indicated}} that there were 2.27 traffic delays per kilometre in the original <b>charging</b> <b>zone.</b> This compared with a figure of 2.3 before {{the introduction of the}} congestion charge. After the scheme was introduced they had measured an improvement in journey times of 0.7 minutes per km, or 30%. This improvement had decreased to 22% in 2006, and during 2006 congestion levels had increased so that the improvement, compared to the year before the scheme, was just 7%. TfL explained this as a result of changes to road priorities within the zone, delays caused by new pedestrian and road user safety schemes, and, most particularly, a doubling of road works {{in the latter half of}} 2006. Utilities were encouraged to complete planned road works in the year preceding the congestion charge, so it would appear that the first year of measurement used for later comparisons would also have been affected by streetworks to some extent.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} the {{congestion}} charge zone on local businesses is a contested issue. The TfL estimates that the effect on business has been overall neutral. However the effect on business differs significantly between stores. Some shops and businesses are reported to be heavily affected by the charge, {{both in terms of}} lost sales due to reduced traffic and increased delivery costs, as recognised by the London Chamber of Commerce. In August 2003, the John Lewis Partnership, a large department store, announced that {{in the first six months}} of the charge's operation, sales at their Oxford Street store fell by 7.3% whilst sales at other stores in the Greater London area but outside the Congestion Charge Zone rose by 1.7%. To partly compensate for the loss of revenue they extended opening hours and introduced regular Sunday opening for the first time. However London First's own report indicated that business was broadly supportive. Subsequently, another report stated that there had been a reduction in some employment in the <b>charging</b> <b>zone.</b> TfL criticised the reports as unrepresentative and that its own statistics reported no effect on business.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{announced}} in July 2008 {{that the new}} CO2 charging structure {{will no longer be}} implemented. Among other reasons, he said the environmental charge would encourage travel by thousands of smaller vehicles free of charge, resulting in increased congestion and pollution. He also discarded plans for extending the charge zone to the suburbs, and announced he will review the western extension implemented in 2007, based on a public consultation planned for September 2008. Having held a five-week public consultation with residents in the autumn of 2008, Johnson decided to remove the 2007 Western Extension from the congestion <b>charging</b> <b>zone</b> beginning on January 4, 2011, to increase the basic charge to , and also to introduce an automated payment system called Congestion Charging Auto Pay (CC Auto Pay), which will charge vehicles {{based on the number of}} charging days a vehicle travels within the <b>charging</b> <b>zone</b> each month, and the drivers of these vehicles will pay a reduced [...] daily charge.|$|E

40|$|This paper assesses whether two {{sustainability}} policies {{currently in}} effect in London, a congestion <b>charge</b> <b>zone</b> {{and a low}} emission zone, have affected freight operations and reduced vehicle kilometers travelled. It investigates responses by freight operators, including re-timing, re-routing, or {{reducing the number of}} trips, or replacing vehicles. Freight traffic trends from 1994 to 2012 were identified using road traffic estimates, cordon counts, and vehicle speed data and supplemented by interviews with freight industry experts and operators. Findings indicate that freight traffic increased throughout London during this timeframe, but declined in the central boroughs partly within the congestion <b>charge</b> <b>zone.</b> The congestion <b>charge</b> may have time-shifted some light goods trips, but most freight trips face a variety of constraints on operators’ delivery window. No evidence was found of re-routing of freight traffic or avoidance traffic around the <b>charged</b> <b>zone.</b> The low emission zone spurred higher levels of operational change than the congestion <b>charge</b> <b>zone,</b> and it was effective at spurring freight vehicle replacement. The paper also discusses freight operators’ perceptions of these policies and how they could be improved...|$|R

He did, however, reverse a number of measures implemented by Livingstone's administration, ending the city's oil deal with Venezuela, abolishing The Londoner newsletter, and scrapping the half yearly inspections of black cabs, although the latter were reinstated three years later. Abolishing the western wing of the congestion <b>charging</b> <b>zone,</b> he cancelled plans to increase the congestion charge for four-wheel drives. He was subsequently accused of failing to publish an independent report on air pollution commissioned by the Greater London authority.
