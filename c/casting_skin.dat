40|$|Sand-cast {{compacted}} graphite (CG) {{cast iron}} typically presents a surface layer (the <b>casting</b> <b>skin)</b> whose microstructure is significantly different {{than that of}} the bulk material. It is generally believed that the <b>casting</b> <b>skin</b> is the result on interaction between the metal and the mold moisture and atmosphere. This reaction results in a decarburized or graphite-free layer. The thickness of this layer is a function of process variables (e. g. cooling rate, pouring temperature, binder, coating, sand fineness, and Mg and inoculation level). The paper presents a summary of recent findings on the negative effect of <b>casting</b> <b>skin</b> on the static properties of CG iron through the use of the skin quality factor for tensile strength, defined as the ratio between the as-cast and machined tensile strength. A mechanism of <b>casting</b> <b>skin</b> formation is proposed and supported with experimental and computational data...|$|E

40|$|The {{hardness}} profiles {{across the}} thickness of tensile specimens of alloys {{with a range of}} Al contents were used in conjunction with tensile data to determine {{the thickness of}} the strongest possible outer layer for each alloy, thus defining the <b>casting</b> <b>skin.</b> As long as the skin layer remains elastic, the core of the casting is prevented from developing full plasticity. The differentiation between the skin and core regions decreases for the less concentrated alloys, leading to a thicker skin layer by this definition. An existing, complementary definition of the skin, based on the core reaching full plasticity, and by which the skin is thinner in the leaner alloys, is also discussed to provide a comprehensive description of the elasto-plastic transition for all alloy concentrations.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this research project was to investigate phenomena involved in the filling of die cavities with molten alloy in the cold chamber die-casting process. It has long been recognized that the filling pattern of molten metal entering a die cavity influences the quality of die-cast parts. Filling pattern may {{be described as the}} progression of molten metal filling the die cavity geometry as a function of time. The location, size and geometric configuration of points of metal entry (gates), as well as the geometry of the casting cavity itself, have great influence on filling patterns. Knowledge of the anticipated filling patterns in die-castings is important for designers. Locating gates to avoid undesirable flow patterns that may entrap air in the casting is critical to casting quality - as locating vents to allow air to escape from the cavity (last places to fill). Casting quality attributes that are commonly flow related are non-fills, poor surface finish, internal porosity due to trapped air, cold shuts, cold laps, flow lines, <b>casting</b> <b>skin</b> delamination (flaking), and blistering during thermal treatment...|$|E
40|$|Large chilled iron {{mill rolls}} {{fabricated}} by permanent-mold gravity suffer from surface macroscopic cracking during iron solidification. This defect is usually intermittent over time, {{and in some}} extent, unrelated with the chemical composition and the process parameters used. To study this phenomenon, a metallographic analysis {{has been carried out}} on two real 5. 5 -ton chilled iron mill rolls made of the same chemical composition, manufactured with quite similar process parameters, but giving two very different results in practice: one of the two mill rolls exhibited a macroscopic crack. Because of the different metallurgical structures observed, especially regarding graphite content, a three-dimensional (3 D) numerical analysis has been adopted to predict the thermal-mechanical behavior of the casting during the solidification and cooling stages. Special attention has been dedicated to the influence of the graphite expansion on mechanical stresses occurring in the <b>casting</b> <b>skin.</b> Numerical results point out that graphite expansion notably affects the evolution of stress-strain fields within the casting to an extent that it could lead to the formation of macroscopic cracks {{in the early stages of}} the casting solidification. Furthermore, the numerical analysis highlights that the thermal deformation of the permanent mold contributes to increase the risk of cracks to occu...|$|E
50|$|The Phasmatodea {{life cycle}} is hemimetabolous, {{proceeding}} {{through a series}} of several nymphal instars. As is the case with hatching, if the nymph is caught in the encasing of a <b>cast</b> <b>skin</b> or egg capsule, it will likely die because it cannot free itself. Once emerged, the nymphs will eat the <b>cast</b> <b>skin.</b> Adulthood is reached for most species after several months and many molts. The lifespan of Phasmatodea varies by species, but ranges from a few months to up to three years.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-We report here {{a method}} for {{studying}} phase transitions in cuticular lipids of insects. This technique, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), is more sensitive than previous biophysical methods and is applicable to either lipid extracts or lipids in situ (in <b>cast</b> <b>skins</b> or intact wings). We used FTIR to compare biophysical properties of cuticular lipids in different regions of individual insects. Lipid melting points varied by approx. 10 °C in different body regions of the tropical cockroach, Blaberus craniijk, and by almost 30 °C in the grasshopper, Melanoplus sunguinipes. Using <b>cast</b> <b>skins,</b> we followed {{the time course of}} lipid acclimation to temperature in single individuals of M. sanguinipes. We conclude that FTIR is useful for studies of spatial and temporal differences in cuticular lipids of arthropods.

In some species, {{the transformation of}} the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent {{for a minute or two}} resting on the exuviae (<b>cast</b> <b>skin)</b> and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the water before transforming.|$|R

50|$|Adults {{emerge in}} late spring, and after mating, the female lays eggs on the {{previous}} year's needles.

500|$|Moulting is {{repeated}} periodically throughout a snake's life. Before a moult, the snake stops eating and often hides or {{moves to a}} safe place. Just before shedding, the skin becomes dull and dry looking and the eyes become cloudy or blue-colored. The inner surface of the old outer skin liquefies. This causes the old outer skin to separate from the new inner skin. After a few days, the eyes clear and the snake [...] "crawls" [...] out of its old skin. The old skin breaks near the mouth and the snake wriggles out aided by rubbing against rough surfaces.
