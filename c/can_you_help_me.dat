60|$|DEAR Sir:--I {{am not in}} a {{position}} where it would hurt much for me to not be nominated on the national ticket; but I am where it would hurt some for me to not get the Illinois delegates. What I expected when I wrote the letter to Messrs. Dole and others is now happening. Your discomfited assailants are most bitter against me; and they will, for revenge upon me, lay to the Bates egg in the South, and to the Seward egg in the North, and go far toward squeezing me out in the middle with nothing. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> a little in this matter in your end of the vineyard.

"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, {{she seemed}} to be," [...] {{continued}} he; [...] "asked more questions about the house, and terms, and taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant with business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite unconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say, she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once; she told me so herself: sister to the gentleman who lived {{a few years back}} at Monkford. Bless me! what was his name? At this moment I cannot recollect his name, though I have heard it so lately.

6000|$|... "How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> or any one," [...] she demanded, [...] "unless you {{can take}} me away from these people? Listen! Until {{a few months ago}} I had {{scarcely}} seen my stepmother. She fetched me away from the convent, took me to Paris for some clothes, and since then I have done nothing but go to parties and houses where the people seem all to have fine names, but behave horribly. I know that I am rich. They told me that before I left the convent, so that I might be a little prepared, but is that any reason why every man, old and young, should say foolish things to me, and pretend that they have fallen in love, when I know all the time that it is my fortune they are thinking of. And my stepmother speaks of marrying me as though I were a piece of merchandise, to be disposed of to the highest bidder. I do not like her friends. I do not like the way they live. I have never liked Major Forrest. Last night your lodger and another man came to the Hall. They asked questions about Lord Ronald. They asked questions and they were told lies. I am sure of it. It got on my nerves. I thought I should shriek. Major Forrest said that it was he who drove Lord Ronald into Lynn, thirty-five miles away, at six o'clock in the morning. I am sure that he could not have driven the car a hundred yards." ...|$|E
