50|$|The guests {{reached the}} end of the {{darkness}} and reach the Tribal Arts rooms, where, in the first, a large tiki figure dominates the room, spewing lava from its mouth. Two tiki poles stand on either side, as well as multiple other tiki statues. The room is full of chanting and tribal drums, all in tune with the music. some statues from Polynesia rotate and blow darts pinning Albert. Then the carriages go into the Chinese Salon where a giant jade Monkey King statue is brought to life and uses its staff to create a tornado, making the room spin and causing all the tapestries in the salon are shaken. A panda goes out of one of them and enters in another one with two common cranes. The vehicles continuously circle the room during this scene. Albert appears on a wall and the statue tries to hit him with a lightning bolt. This only succeeds in blowing away a portion of the wall and a vase crumbles, showing the dusk sky. Albert is then blown away from the manor and manages to hold onto a large harp as the enchanted music box suddenly appears. Albert jumps onto the box as the carriages move back to the Acquisitions and <b>Cataloguing</b> <b>Room.</b>|$|E

50|$|He {{spends the}} last few {{chapters}} locked in the <b>catalogue</b> <b>rooms</b> of the University, poring over old documents, and frantically trying to uncover the secret location of the Second Foundation. It is later discovered that the Mule was manipulating him into this state of arousal {{in order to achieve}} the great insights that would emulate Hari Seldon's work. Unfortunately for Mis, this heightened state is fatal, and when he did discover the secret, he was on his deathbed. Bayta Darrell sees through the Mule's plan, and she kills Mis with a blaster before he could reveal the location of the other Foundation. Ebling Mis is possibly the only one since Seldon's time to have discovered the secret, but the information died with him, and the truth about the Second Foundation would not be revealed until many years later.|$|R

The former Golden Hall/Salon is the most notable space in the house, and includes the grand tapestry by Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro, [...] "O Carnaval de Veneza", that is today used for the library reading rooms. The old music room (with decoration inspired by classical mythology) was also transformed into a reading room and decorated by Francisco Vilaça, who executed stuccos of musical instruments. A small vestibule that led to the old dining room is decorated by a grand ceramic panel created by Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro and executed by the Fábrica de Faianças in Caldas da Rainha, that includes a small fountain.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to find out about the activities done by the DPK Gunugkidul as the strategy to develop the library service based on the SWOT Analysis and to know about the obstacles that were faced during the service developing process based on the SWOT analysis. This research was a qualitative research which took place in DPK Gunungkidul. Data collecting was done using observation method, interview method and documentation method. Data analysis used descriptive qualitative that was begun with data collecting, data reducing, data serving and elaborating. Data validity test used triangulation and member check techniques. Based on the interview result and the research that was done could be concluded that the service developing strategies of DPK Gunungkidul were (a) DPK Gunungkidul did such approach to attract the users to come to the library. (b) DPK Gunungkidul assisted the users in knowing the facilities and the collections of the library. (c) DPK Gunungkidul increased the facilities including computer units and faster internet connections, ordering book box, music instruments and reading area in the library. (d) DPK Gunungkidul made communications with the third-party institution to hold the mobile library activity. (e) DPK Gunungkidul made training programs such as batik printing, traditional puppet making and traditional cap making. Whereas, the obstacles faced by the DPK Gunungkidul were (a) the minimum number of SDM (Human Resource) that worked in DPK Gunungkidul. (b) lack of user monitoring in internet service area. (c) the minimum number of the transportations owned by the DPK Gunungkidul to support mobile library activity. (e) high number of book loss in DPK Gunungkidul’s collective borrowing, it was about 50 books. The researcher’s suggestion was DPK Gunungkidul should maximize the librarian role in giving service to the users by developing the disciplines and responsibilities in doing the job desk, giving the attractive activities to the people in Gunungkidul, improving the infrastructures and facilities such as increasing the number of tables and chairs at the reading area, computer units as the electronic <b>catalogues,</b> <b>room</b> lighting and expanding the library room. And also, it would be much better if DPK Gunungkidul rearranging the library room, so that the visitors would get fresh atmosphere and it would be more attractive...|$|R

[...] Horton also stated that the song [...] "pulls together the greatest titbits from the Blur <b>catalogue,</b> and finds <b>room</b> for traces of Gorillaz and all the other malarkey Damon Albarn's turned his magpie mind to. So it's bumped along by the kind of plastic electronic parp you could snap up on Freecycle, echoing Gorillaz' [...] "Doncamatic" [...] in its cheap-as-chips bop, and wigging out to a 'chorus' of frenzied fuzz-bass that'd slot nicely into the more annoying nooks of Think Tank." ...|$|R

The institution which currently is the Institute of Mathematics of the University of Naples was on the way of reconstituting, the eight former mathematics institutes of the university having been literally [...] "torn to pieces" [...] by the Allied forces Military Police. It was necessary to collect and reorder in a new library all the volumes of the previously existed ones, then piled on the floor of a single <b>room,</b> <b>catalogue</b> them ex-novo and create new records, provide the library administration, and of course there was no administrative personnel available nor financial resources.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to present and discuss a work in {{progress}} that involves: – the creation of online editions of historical documents of a metalinguistic nature, which function both as publications and corpora, allowing for the comparison of manuscript images with the diplomatic edition and providing tools for analysis; – the application and development of tools that can easily be manipulated by users and adapted to different kinds of historical texts. The project is still in its first phase, which involves inventorying the metalinguistic texts held by the Évora Public Library (BPE). A survey of the texts of this nature identified in the various catalogues of the library has been carried out. Until now, 43 manuscripts and 200 printed texts with metalinguistic interest, all coming from the reserved catalogues of the BPE, have been identified. In the old reading <b>room</b> <b>catalogue,</b> further 313 works were also identified, while the modern catalogue is yet to be studied. As soon as the inventory is concluded, this will be followed by the organization and the online publication of a catalogue identifying and describing (bibliographical description) the works of a metalinguistic nature held by BPE. The texts’ digital processing shall begin after these previous tasks have been completed...|$|R
