Also, essential for the functioning of national economics is maintaining and increasing of the competitiveness of strategic sectors, such as energy sector. In this research article it was analyzed the investing process of energy sector in Ukraine and identified the trends of development; it was compared the electricity prices in Ukraine and EU countries; it was specified the basic problems of pricing in this sphere; it was justified the necessity to change the pricing methods in domestic energy sector; it was developed a model of management and forecasting the volume of investment in the energy sector on the basis of correlation-regression analysis. The resulting model allows us to predict the volume of investment, gradually changing the price. Than it was identified recommendations for <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> policy in view of certain factors of influence. ? ?????? ??????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ???????, ?????????? ???????? ???????? ??????????????? ? ?????? ?????, ??????????? ?????? ?????????? ? ??????????????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ?? ?????? ?????????????-?????????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ?? ????????? ???????? ???????? ? ?????? ???????????? ???????? ???????...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a static {{model of the}} price calculation for the various alternative sources of electricity, which includes technical and economic performance of different energy sources for the guaranteed power. Specified table with the calculated technical and economic indicators for the various alternative energy sources is given. A dynamic model is presented that combines the energy performance of the power system on the one hand, and economic indicators of closed macroeconomic system on the other, as the price regulation of the energy in Ukraine is currently taking place in static, not allowing to assess the dynamic change of tariff rates of electricity in isolated local systems. When hopping isolated power generating capacity {{of the system is}} <b>changing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> price of electricity cannot be taken into account when using static models. An isolated system consisting of a diesel generator and the consumer is studied. The model allows to investigate the effect of transients generator to replace the price indices of the economic system, and assess adequate tariff price for both producer and consumer of electricity. This model is modeled in the Matlab environment. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model that}} describes <b>the</b> role of <b>tariffs</b> {{as a source of}} government revenue. The model takes a public finance perspective and treats as part of the optimum revenue-raising tax package, relating <b>the</b> behavior of <b>tariff</b> rates and revenues to observable macroeconomic variables such as income and government spending. Although the approach is quite general, the model is constructed to fit the stylized facts concerning <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> role of <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> in U. S. history. It is shown that relative collection costs for tariffs and other forms of taxes interact with changes in macroeconomic variables to explain the regime shifts (qualitative changes in the relative importance of tariffs and other taxes) found in U. S. tariff history. Copyright 1992 by The London School of Economics and Political Science. ...|$|R
40|$|The MERCOSUR is an {{imperfect}} custom union whose Common External Tariff (CET) {{is lower than}} the one that each member applied before 1991. From 1990 to 1994 regional trade grew, and the patterns of trade changed. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze if the countries welfare and productive efficiency will improve, or if the productive inefficiency of each member will be protected because of MERCOSUR. In order to analyze this issue we perfomed three differents experiments using the GTAP a multicountry Applied General Equilibrium Model. The first experiment simulates a unilateral <b>tariff</b> reduction resembling <b>the</b> trade liberalization results of the CET. The second experiment supposes that the MERCOSUR countries remove all <b>the</b> <b>tariffs</b> on regional trade without <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> external <b>tariffs.</b> Finally, in <b>the</b> third experiment both policies are implemented. In the three experiments, regional trade increases as a consequence of trade liberalization inside a "natural block", as a MERCOSUR. Welfare in MERCOSUR countries also increases in the three experiments. The best policy for Argentina is unilateral trade liberalization, represented by the first experiment. However, the best one for Brazil, is the unilateral liberalization plus regional liberalization (represented by the third experiment). ...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> ethanol <b>tariff</b> {{is one of}} the {{instruments}} used by the government to encourage domestic ethanol production. Existing literature analyzing the market and welfare effects of <b>the</b> US ethanol <b>tariff</b> has concluded that removing <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> would increase social surplus and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, due to the replacement of corn ethanol with lower cost and lower GHG intensive sugarcane ethanol. This paper re-examines these findings {{in the presence of a}} domestic cellulosic ethanol industry. The current RFS mandate requires 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuel, a portion of which could be met by any non-starch based biofuel that reduces emissions by at least 50 % compared to an energy equivalent amount of gasoline. Sugarcane ethanol has been classified as an advanced biofuel, and competes for market share with domestic advanced biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol. In addition, it also competes with corn ethanol for market share in the non-advanced biofuel market. The dual market for sugarcane ethanol raises the question of which domestic biofuel market <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> protects. Our results show that the effect of removing <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> on social welfare and GHG emissions is ambiguous and depends on which biofuel market <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> is protecting. If <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> protects <b>the</b> corn ethanol market, its removal increases welfare and GHG emissions. However, if <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> protects <b>the</b> cellulosic ethanol market, removing <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> could increase emissions. Whether <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> protects either <b>the</b> corn ethanol or cellulosic ethanol market, or both depends on the relative costs and supply elasticities of the three types of biofuel. In general, the removal of <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> leads to an increase in social surplus, although in some cases, such as when the excess supply elasticity of sugarcane ethanol is not very elastic, net welfare could decrease when <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> is removed. Removal of <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> also reduces <b>the</b> share of domestically produced fuel, and this effect is greater when <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> is protecting both the cellulosic and corn ethanol markets, i. e. the removal of <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> causes a reduction in the production of both biofuels. biofuel, ethanol tariff, fuel externalities, Agricultural and Food Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, Q 17, Q 18, Q 42,...|$|R

40|$|In this {{teaching}} note, {{we discuss}} the basic principles for tariff setting. Tariff setting {{is very important for}} regulated industries, such as water and power. <b>The</b> <b>tariff</b> should provide an appropriate risk-adjusted return to the investor. If <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> were too low, then the investors would not be willing to invest. On the other hand, if <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> were too high, then it would reduce the consumers’ welfare. We examine the Rate of Return method for calculating <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> in a regulated firm. In the rate of return method, <b>the</b> <b>tariff</b> compensates <b>the</b> investor for all the costs that the investor incurs, including a fair return. We use the discounted cash flow approach to value the return that the investor receives. The results of both calculations must be consistent. In particular, using simple examples, we show that {{in the presence of a}} positive expected inflation rate, <b>the</b> typical <b>tariff</b> calculation, Rate of return method, is an overestimation of the required payment to the equity holder. ...|$|R

Nevertheless, the South strongly resisted <b>the</b> <b>Tariff</b> of 1828 for several reasons.

These unfortunate results caused many in the South to refer to <b>the</b> <b>Tariff</b> of 1828 as <b>the</b> <b>Tariff</b> of Abominations.|$|R
