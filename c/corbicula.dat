50|$|A {{field study}} from Ecuador {{reported}} that the fruit bodies of Staheliomyces are visited by species from the stingless bee genus Trigona. The bee visits are several minutes in duration, during which time small portions of the gleba are collected and stored in the pollen basket (<b>corbiculae)</b> of the hind legs. The authors determined that the <b>corbiculae</b> of approaching bees are always empty. Bee <b>corbiculae</b> are normally used to carry food and nest-building material, and the gleba of Staheliomyces {{may be used for}} one of these purposes, but the authors did not observe the bees after they had collected the gleba.|$|R

50|$|<b>Corbicula</b> fluminea is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} clam, an aquatic bivalve mollusk in the family Cyrenidae. This species is often confused with <b>Corbicula</b> fluminalis due to the two species similar colour and texture.|$|E
5|$|Pollen {{is removed}} from flowers {{deliberately}} or incidentally by bumblebees. Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees {{come in contact with}} the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar. When it enters a flower, the bumblebee's body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers. In queens and workers this is then groomed into the <b>corbiculae</b> (pollen baskets) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains. Male bumblebees do not have <b>corbiculae</b> and do not purposively collect pollen. Bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination, in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles.|$|R
50|$|B. bohemicus {{does not}} {{act as a}} pollinator, as it has lost its pollen-collecting <b>corbiculae</b> and {{produces}} no worker females. Interaction with humans is minimal, as B. bohemicus individuals are only rarely found outside of nests, and do not exhibit aggressive behavior towards humans unless disturbed.|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} nectar, pollen and resin {{loads of}} individual workers among colonies from six Trigona species in Sabah, Borneo. Individual bees rarely collected {{large amounts of}} both nectar and pollen during the same foraging trip. Instead, comparison of crop contents across departing, flower-visiting, and returning bees suggests that pollen-collecting workers often carried highly concentrated nectar in their crop upon nest departure. During their foraging trip, this crop nectar volume decreased progressively until crops were largely empty {{when they returned to}} their nest. Individually marked pollen foragers carried highly concentrated nectar when they left their nest, while crops and <b>corbiculae</b> from marked nectar foragers were empty upon departure. We suggest that a large proportion of previously stored and highly concentrated nectar may be required for pollen adhesion to <b>corbiculae</b> and/or serve as fuel during foraging on nectar-poor flowers...|$|R
50|$|The New Latin term <b>corbicula</b> is a {{diminutive}} of corbis, a basket or pannier. Corbula (not a term used in entomology) is given as the Late Latin diminutive, {{but at least}} one dictionary simply lists <b>corbicula</b> as a very small basket.|$|E

5000|$|There {{was little}} formal {{description}} of the <b>corbicula</b> before Carl Linnaeus explained the biological function of pollen in the mid-18th century. In English {{the first edition of}} Encyclopædia Britannica described the structure in 1771 without giving it any special name. The second edition, 1777, refers to the <b>corbicula</b> simply as the [...] "basket". By 1802 William Kirby had introduced the Latin term <b>corbicula</b> into English. He had borrowed it, with acknowledgement, from Réaumur. This New Latin term, like many other Latin anatomical terms, had the advantages of specificity, international acceptability, and culture neutrality. By 1820 the term pollen-basket seems to have gained acceptance in beekeeping vernacular, though a century later a compendium of entomological terminology recognised pollen-plate and <b>corbicula</b> without including [...] "pollen-basket". Yet another century, and authorities as eminent as the current authors of [...] "Imms" [...] included only the terms scopa and <b>corbicula</b> in the index, though they did include [...] "pollen basket" [...] in the text.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWorker {{body size}} {{is a key}} feature for stingless bee biology, being related with the {{foraging}} range of colonies. We correlated the intertegular span, corbicular area, head width, and interocular distance, {{as well as the}} fresh weight, from workers of Melipona flavolineata, a species from the Amazonian Region, with the stored reserves of honey and pollen. The food reserves decreased with the increase of rainfall, and there was a significant correlation between intertegular span, corbicular area, and food stores. The <b>corbiculae</b> was inversely correlated with food reserves, while the width of thorax was positively related. We consider the allometric variation of thorax width and corbicular area as a mechanism to adjust colonial food collection, since larger <b>corbiculae</b> would maximize the pollen-gathering during the rainy, dearth periods, and when the resource supply increases, the workers increase in the width of thorax, being able to explore larger areas and replenish the colonial food stores...|$|R
50|$|The thorax is whitish with a {{black band}} between the wings. The two first terga (abdominal segments) are white, {{followed}} by a black band; {{the rest of the}} abdomen is red. Variation in the pattern is considerable, but the form B. erzurumensis f. oezbeki (earlier considered a separate species, B. oezbeki) has white fur on the face and the <b>corbiculae</b> (pollen basket) is covered with red hairs.|$|R
50|$|Though Trigona fuscipennis collect pollen from {{a variety}} of plants, making them a polylectic bee species, in some plants, they collect pollen in a special way using a biting method. To extract pollen, they use their mandibles to make small holes at or close {{to the base of the}} tubular anthers of the flower. Collection of pollen is {{achieved}} through these with the use of the proboscis. The pollen is then moved on to the thoracic sternum with the help of its fore legs and the bee flies away once it cannot fit anymore pollen on its thoracic sternum. While hovering in mid flight, not too far away from the flower, the bee transfers the pollen to its <b>corbiculae</b> by using its fore legs to move the pollen from its thoracic sternum to its middle legs which then move it to the <b>corbiculae</b> on its hind legs, which are moved slightly forward to help make the pollen transfer process easier. One there is enough pollen on its hind legs, the bee flies away from the vicinity of the flower.|$|R

50|$|A key {{characteristic}} of Bombus vestalis {{is the lack}} of <b>corbiculae</b> or a pollen basket on the hind legs of the bee. This is evolutionarily relevant because Bombus vestalis does not make its own nests or collect its own resources.

Ochenta semillas fueron recogidas en el interior de las colonias (mezcladas al geoprópolis en los basureros y fisuras) y también en el exterior, cerca de la entrada de las colonias, como resultado de la caída de esas semillas de las <b>corbículas</b> durante el vuelo de las obreras. Las semillas fueron plantadas en semilleros para la producción de esquejes y posterior identificación de la especie vegetal. Paralelamente se realizó el rastreo en campo en un radio de aproximadamente 3 Km para la confirmación de la dispersión de las semillas, observaciones de comportamiento de las abejas forrajeando y recolección de semillas. Un total de 170 plántulas de Z. racemosa fueron encontradas en los alrededores del meliponario del GPA-INPA y 160 en el meliponario Vale Verde. Esos resultados indican que tanto M. compressipes manaosensis como M. seminigra merrillae recolectan y dispersan las semillas de Z. racemosa. During {{the period from}} January to April 2005 seeds of Zygia racemosa were found incorporated in the nest structures, inside the colonies of stingless bee in two experimental meliponaries in Manaus - Am. It was registered an intense activity of the bee-workers of Melipona seminigra merrillae and M. compressipes manaosensis arriving from the field with seeds set in the <b>corbiculae</b> adhered with resin and/or leaving the colonies with the seeds clipped in their jaws. Eighty seeds were collected inside the colonies (mixed with the batume in the litter and/or cracks), and also outside them, near {{the entrance of the}} colony, {{as a result of the}} falling of <b>corbiculae</b> during the flight of the bee-workers. These seeds were planted in seedbeds for seedling production and posterior identification of the botanical species. As a way to confirm the scattering of the seeds, searches were done in the field (in an area of approximately 3 km of extension), as well as observations of the collection of the seeds made by the bees. A total of 170 seedlings of Z. racemosa were found in the outskirts of the GPA-INPA meliponary and 160 in the Vale Verde meliponary. The results indicate that M. compressipes and M. seminigra collect and scatter the seeds of Z. racemosa...|$|R
50|$|Females forage for pollen, nectar, resin, mud, and feces. These {{materials}} are packed in the <b>corbiculae</b> {{and brought back}} to the nest. Pollen and nectar foraging trips are on average longer than other resource trips. Mud collecting usually takes only a few minutes while pollen and nectar collecting could take up to two hours.

The female bees collect pollen and nectar from dawn to around noon, while mud, feces, and resin were collected mostly in the afternoon. E. meriana are diurnal, limiting foraging to periods between dawn and dusk.|$|R

50|$|B. bohemicus {{is part of}} {{the order}} Hymenoptera, which {{includes}} ants, bees, wasps, and sawflies, the family Apidae, specific to bees, and the genus Bombus, which includes all bumblebees. B. bohemicus belongs to the subgenus Psithyrus, or the Cuckoo bees, which includes 29 species found in Europe and the New World. Species in this subgenus are obligate parasites, meaning that they can no longer successfully reproduce or even survive long independently of their hosts, because the females have lost their pollen-collecting <b>corbiculae</b> and their ability to rear their own brood. Cuckoo bees have also entirely eliminated the worker class, producing only reproductive males and females. This form of parasitism is known as inquilinism.|$|R
50|$|Each brood cell {{is filled}} {{two-thirds of its}} volume with a pale yellow, sticky pollen/nectar mixture.

They make a rotation with the posterior {{part of the body}} inside the cell and forelegs around the resin collar. It is suggested that this allows the pollen mixture to be pushed down and packed into the cell. Other materials like mud, feces, and resin are deposited in the nest.

50|$|Like the European {{honey bee}} (Apis mellifera), which {{provides}} most of Australia's commercially produced honey, stingless bees have enlarged areas {{on their back}} legs for carrying pollen back to the hive. After a foraging expedition, these pollen baskets or <b>corbiculae</b> can be seen stuffed full of bright orange or yellow pollen. Stingless bees also collect nectar, which they store in an extension of their gut called a crop. Back at the hive, the bees ripen or dehydrate the nectar droplets by spinning them inside their mouthparts until honey is formed. Ripening concentrates the nectar and increases the sugar content, {{though it is not}} nearly as concentrated as the honey from true honey bees; it is much thinner in consistency, and more prone to spoiling.|$|R

However, S. postica guard bees have been observed to bite nest intruders as they alert the other colony members through pheromone signaling. These alarm pheromones contain 2-heptonal and other ketones as active substances.
