Now she lay across the bed, in {{crumpled}} <b>lavender</b> <b>cotton</b> and shabby pumps, very feminine, utterly cowed. She lifted her head in stupid terror. Her hair was in tousled strings {{and her face was}} sallow, creased. Her eyes were a blur from weeping.|$|R
50|$|Phytophthora tentaculata is a plant {{pathogen}} that causes root and stalk rot. It was first isolated in 1993 in a nursery in Germany infecting Chrysanthemum, Verbena and Delphinium ajacis.

50|$|For {{many years}} Fish indeed used very little {{gardening}} help. She squeezed her writing around working 18-hour days on developing {{and maintaining the}} garden, even doing dry stone walling and path-laying herself. Her silver garden caught {{the heat of the}} day, and her damp, shady garden used a stream that ran behind an old malthouse. The silver-leafed wormwood Artemisia absinthium 'Lambrook Silver' is still a popular variety. Other varieties named after her garden include the spurge Euphorbia characias ssp. wulfenii 'Lambrook Gold', the <b>cotton</b> <b>lavender</b> Santolina chamaecyparissus 'Lambrook Silver', and the primrose Primula 'Lambrook Mauve'. She hunted out several rare old double forms and single and named coloured forms of primrose. There are varieties of Pulmonaria, Penstemon, Bergenia, Dicentra, Hebe, Euphorbia characias and Hemerocallis named after her. She is credited with aptly naming the variety Astrantia major subsp involucrata 'Shaggy' on discovering it in her garden.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lavender</b> <b>cotton</b> (Santolina chamaecyparissus L.) shoot cuttings, {{obtained}} from two-year-old mother plants, were rooted in five different media under an unheated foil tunnel. Two ready-made and widely recommended media were used: Hartmann peat substrate and Ceres peat-coconut substrate, {{as well as}} three prepared mixtures: high peat + mineral soil, high peat + perlite and high peat + sand. The influence of medium type {{on the number of}} rooted cuttings {{and the quality of the}} root system was assessed for two cultivation times during a three-year study after eight weeks from the date of cutting. As far as the ready-made rooting substrates are concerned, Ceres peat-coconut substrate turned out to be better when compared with the Hartmann substrate. The number of high quality rooted cuttings was larger when media containing high peat mixed with either mineral soil or sand were used in comparison with the mixture of high peat and perlite...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Some of the herbal supplementations {{consumed}} by the athletes {{in order to improve}} their athletic functions are selected to affect the cardio-vascular system. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the aromatic effects of lavender essential oils on the heart electrical functions during exercises in the healthy girls. Materials & Methods: In the repeated pretest-posttest semi-experimental study, 9 active healthy girls studying sport sciences in Shahid Rajaei University were studied in 2015. The subjects were selected via purposeful sampling method. As counter balance, either ethanol soaked <b>cotton</b> or <b>lavender</b> oil essence were exposed to each subject, and the Conconi test was conducted as a sport activity. Both electrocardiogram waves and blood pressure data were recorded before the activities and immediately after and one minute after the end of the activity (recovery). Data were analyzed by SPSS 20 software using repeated ANOVA and student T tests. Findings: Immediately after the test, the systolic blood pressure in experimental group was significantly higher than control group (p< 0. 05). In addition, the inhalation of the lavender oil in experimental group increased R wave height during the final moments of exercises compared to control group (p< 0. 05). Nevertheless, the systolic blood pressure, T wave height, and R-R and Q-T distances did not significantly change in response to the exercises. Conclusion: During the sport activities, the inhalation of lavender affects the heart ventricular function, as well as the heart beat and the systolic blood pressure. ...|$|R
6000|$|All the {{presents}} which Newcome had ever transmitted to his sister-in-law from India {{had been taken}} out of the <b>cotton</b> and <b>lavender</b> in which the faithful creature kept them. It was a fine hot day in June, but I promise you Miss Honeyman wore her blazing scarlet Cashmere shawl; her great brooch, representing the Taj of Agra, was in her collar; and her bracelets (she used to say, I am given to understand they are called bangles, my dear, by the natives) decorated the sleeves round her lean old hands, which trembled with pleasure as they received the kind grasp of the Colonel of colonels. How busy those hands had been that morning! What custards they had whipped!--what a triumph of pie-crusts they had achieved! Before Colonel Newcome had been ten minutes in the house, the celebrated veal-cutlets made their appearance. Was not the whole house adorned in expectation of his coming? Had not Mr. Kuhn, the affable foreign gentleman of the first-floor lodgers, prepared a French dish? Was not Betty on the look-out, and instructed to put the cutlets on the fire at the very moment when the Colonel's carriage drove up to her mistress's door? The good woman's eyes twinkled, the kind old hand and voice shook, as, holding up a bright glass of Madeira, Miss Honeyman drank the Colonel's health. [...] "I promise you, my dear Colonel," [...] says she, nodding her head, adorned with a bristling superstructure of lace and ribbons, [...] "I promise you, that I can drink your health in good wine!" [...] The wine was of his own sending, and so were the China fire-screens, and the sandalwood workbox, and the ivory cardcase, and those magnificent pink and white chessmen, carved like little sepoys and mandarins, with the castles on elephants' backs, George the Third and his queen in pink ivory, against the Emperor of China and lady in white--the delight of Clive's childhood, the chief ornament of the old spinster's sitting-room.|$|R
5000|$|Bowles {{gave his}} name to upwards of forty {{varieties}} of plant, and there are others that originated with him. For example, he named a hellebore 'Gerrard Parker' after a local art master, Crocus tommasinianus 'Bobbo' after the boy who first spotted it and Rosmarinus officinalis 'Miss Jessopp's Upright' (Miss Jessopp's Upright Rosemary) after a gardening neighbour, Euphemia Jessopp, for whom he also named the small white Crocus x jessoppiae in 1924. Erysimum 'Bowles' Mauve' was among [...] "200 plants for 200 years" [...] chosen by the RHS to mark its bicentenary in 2004 and, {{to coincide with the}} hundredth anniversary of the Chelsea Flower Show in 2013, was shortlisted (from among introductions between 1973-83) as one of ten [...] "plants of the centenary". Other significant introductions included Viola 'Bowles' Black', <b>cotton</b> <b>lavender</b> 'Edward Bowles' (Santolina pinnata subsp. neopolitana), and Bowles' golden sedge (Carex stricta 'Aurea'), which he found on Wicken Fen and has been described by another doyen of plantsmen, Christopher Lloyd, as [...] "a plant to treasure, its colour changing in unexpected ways". Vita Sackville-West cited the yellow and brown Crocus chrysanthus 'E.A. Bowles' as among the first bulbs to flower in her garden at Sissinghurst in January or early February, while, in the nuttery there, Bowles' golden grass (Milium effusum 'Aureum') is interspersed in spring with wood anemones and white bluebells. Another spring plant, the slow growing Muscari (grape hyacinth) 'Bowles's Peacock', was commended by Richard Hobbs, holder of the British National Plant Collection of Muscari, as [...] "charming and small ... but with superb peacock-blue flowers, which in a pot are easily admired at close quarters".|$|E
40|$|The {{modelling}} of {{the experimental}} data of the extraction of the volatile oil from six aromatic plants (coriander, fennel, savoury, winter savoury, <b>cotton</b> <b>lavender</b> and thyme) was performed using five mathematical models, based on differential mass balances. In all cases the extraction was internal diffusion controlled and the internal mass transfer coefficienty (k(s)) {{have been found to}} change with pressure, temperature and particle size. For fennel, savoury and <b>cotton</b> <b>lavender,</b> the external mass transfer and the equilibrium phase also influenced the second extraction period, since k(s) changed with the tested flow rates. In general, the axial dispersion coefficient could be neglected for the conditions studied, since Peclet numbers were high. On the other hand, the solute-matrix interaction had to be considered in order to ensure a satisfactory description {{of the experimental}} data...|$|E
40|$|The {{volatiles}} from Coriandrum sativum L., Satureja montana L., Santolina chamaecyparissus L., and Thymus vulgaris L. {{were isolated}} by hydrodistillation (essential oil) and supercritical fluid extraction (volatile oil). Their effect on seed germination and root and shoot {{growth of the}} surviving seedlings of four crops (Zea mays L., Triticum durum L., Pisum sativum L., and Lactuca sativa L.) and two weeds (Portulaca oleracea L. and Vicia sativa L.) was investigated and {{compared with those of}} two synthetic herbicides, Agrocide and Prowl. The volatile oils of thyme and <b>cotton</b> <b>lavender</b> seemed to be promising alternatives to the synthetic herbicides because they were the least injurious to the crop species. The essential oil of winter savory, on the other hand, affected both crop and weeds and can be appropriate for uncultivated fields...|$|E
60|$|At {{the mosque}} the patio was not taken in {{only because it}} was so large, but I find by our records that it was much molested by a beggar who {{followed}} us when we dismounted at the gate of the Court of Oranges, and all but took our minds off the famous Moorish fountain in the midst. It was not a fountain of the plashing or gushing sort, but a noble great pool in a marble basin. The women who clustered about it were not laughing and chattering, or singing, or even dancing, in the right Andalusian fashion, but stood silent in statuesque poses from which they seemed in no haste to stir for filling their water jars and jugs. The Moorish tradition of irrigation confronting one in all the travels and histories as a supreme agricultural advantage which the Arabs took back to Africa with them, leaving Spain to thirst and fry, lingers here in the circles sunk round the orange trees and fed by little channels. The trees grew about as the fancy took them, and did not mind the incongruous palms towering as irregularly above them. While we wandered toward the mosque a woman robed in white <b>cotton,</b> with a <b>lavender</b> scarf crossing her breast, came in as irrelevantly as the orange trees and stood as stably as the palms; in her night-black hair she alone in Cordova redeemed the pledge of beauty made for all Andalusian women by the reckless poets and romancers, whether in ballads or books of travel.|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of the studies carried out in our laboratories on supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of volatile oils from seven aromatic plants: pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium L.), fennel seeds (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.), coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), savory (Satureja fruticosa Béguinot), winter savory (Satureja montana L.), <b>cotton</b> <b>lavender</b> (Santolina chamaecyparisus) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris), is presented. A flow apparatus with a 1 L extractor and two 0. 27 L separators was built to perform studies at temperatures ranging from 298 to 353 K and pressures up to 30. 0 MPa. The best compromise between yield and composition compared with hydrodistillation (HD) was achieved selecting the optimum experimental conditions of extraction and fractionation. The major differences between HD and SFE oils {{is the presence of}} a small percentage of cuticular waxes and the relative amount of thymoquinone, an oxygenated monoterpene with important biological properties, which is present in the oils from thyme and winter savory. On the other hand, the modeling of our data on supercritical extraction of volatile oil from pennyroyal is discussed using Sovová’s models. These models have been applied successfully to the other volatile oil extractions. Furthermore, other experimental studies involving supercritical CO 2 carried out in our laboratories are also mentioned...|$|E
