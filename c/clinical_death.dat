40|$|Background: Whether seroresponse to {{a vaccine}} such as {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) vaccine {{can provide a}} measure of the functional immune status of HIV-infected persons is unknown. This study evaluated the relationship between HBV vaccine seroresponses and progression to <b>clinical</b> AIDS or <b>death.</b> Methods and Findings: From a large HIV cohort, we evaluated those who received HBV vaccine only after HIV diagnosis and had anti-HBs determination 1 – 12 months after the last vaccine dose. Non-response and positive response were defined as anti-HBs, 10 and $ 10 IU/L, respectively. Participants were followed from date of last vaccination to <b>clinical</b> AIDS, <b>death,</b> or last visit. Univariate and multivariable risk of progression to <b>clinical</b> AIDS or <b>death</b> were evaluated with Cox regression models. A total of 795 participants vaccinated from 1986 – 2010 were included, of which 41 % were responders. During 3, 872 person-years of observation, 122 AIDS or death events occurred (53 % after 1995). Twenty-two percent of non-responders experienced <b>clinical</b> AIDS or <b>death</b> compared with 5 % of responders (p, 0. 001). Non-response to HBV vaccine was associated with a greater than 2 -fold increased risk of <b>clinical</b> AIDS or <b>death</b> (HR 2. 47; 95 % CI, 1. 38 – 4. 43) compared with a positive response, after adjusting for CD 4 count, HIV viral load, HAART use, and delayed type hypersensitivity skin test responses (an in vivo marker of cell-mediated immunity).

25|$|In 2011, a {{controversial}} movie Vysotsky. Thank You For Being Alive was released, script written by his son, Nikita Vysotsky. The actor Sergey Bezrukov portrayed Vysotsky, {{using a combination}} of a mask and CGI effects. The film tells about Vysotsky's illegal underground performances, problems with KGB and drugs, and subsequent <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{supported}} by methods that certainly maintain enough blood circulation and oxygenation for sustaining life during stopped heartbeat and breathing, such as cardiopulmonary bypass, are not customarily considered clinically dead. All {{parts of the}} body except the heart and lungs continue to function normally. <b>Clinical</b> <b>death</b> occurs only if machines providing sole circulatory support are turned off, leaving the patient in a state of stopped blood circulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clinical</b> <b>death</b> {{that occurs}} {{unexpectedly}} {{is treated as}} a medical emergency. CPR is initiated. In a United States hospital, a Code Blue is declared and Advanced Cardiac Life Support procedures used to attempt to restart a normal heartbeat. This effort continues until either the heart is restarted, or a physician determines that continued efforts are useless and recovery is impossible. If this determination is made, the physician pronounces legal death and resuscitation efforts stop.|$|E
30|$|For {{both the}} {{patients}} with <b>clinical</b> brain <b>death</b> {{and the control}} patients, a consensus review of the CTA images was conducted by two trained radiologists with 10  years of experience. The visibility of the ICV, C-MCA, and infratentorial SPV was classified as opacification or non-opacification.|$|R

25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR) during cardiac arrest is ideally {{reversal of the}} clinically dead state by restoration of blood circulation and breathing. However, there is great variation in the effectiveness of CPR for this purpose. Blood pressure is very low during manual CPR, resulting in only a ten-minute average extension of survival. Yet there are cases of patients regaining consciousness during CPR while still in full cardiac arrest. In absence of cerebral function monitoring or frank return to consciousness, the neurological status of patients undergoing CPR is intrinsically uncertain. It is somewhere between the state of <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> and a normal functioning state.|$|E
25|$|One unfortunate {{trademark}} for Passions {{has been}} eerie deaths. In 2002, Josh Ryan Evans, who played Tabitha's extremely popular doll sidekick Timmy, died while on medical leave, just as scenes were airing where Timmy {{died in the}} hospital and went to Heaven. Passions had planned to revive the character in a few months once Evans returned from his own surgery, but instead had to write Timmy out. After five years of evil Crane patriarch Alistair being heard but never having his face seen (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer), Passions finally cast the role with longtime daytime vet David Bailey. Bailey was a hit with the cast as well as the fans, but on Thanksgiving Day 2004, Bailey drowned in his pool, just as scenes were airing where various characters tried to kill Alistair, who actually suffered <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> before being magically revived by Tabitha. Again, the viewers and the producers were stunned, but the show {{had no choice but to}} recast the pivotal role (with John Reilly).|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a {{performance}} at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", as she puts it) and complained of not feeling too good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat down on the couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E

[...] "This is a bullet, gunshot wound, direct to his head and he's bleeding profusely from his nose, from his ear, his brain is shattered into pieces", said a doctor. Buhmaid's [...] "brain was destroyed, but his body was still alive". His <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> prompted a nurse on 20 February to smash a glass-framed image of the Prime Minister. Remaining in ICU for three days, Buhmaid was medically declared to be dead early in the afternoon of 21 February, becoming the seventh victim of the uprising.|$|E
2500|$|The brain, however, {{appears to}} {{accumulate}} ischemic injury {{faster than any}} other organ. Without special treatment after circulation is restarted, full recovery of the brain after more than 3 minutes of <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> at normal body temperature is rare. [...] Usually brain damage or later brain death results after longer intervals of <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> even if the heart is restarted and blood circulation is successfully restored.

2500|$|Reduced body temperature, or {{therapeutic}} hypothermia, during <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> {{slows the}} rate of injury accumulation, and extends the time period during which <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> can be survived. [...] The decrease in {{the rate of}} injury can be approximated by the Q10 rule, which states that the rate of biochemical reactions decreases by a factor of two for every 10°C reduction in temperature. As a result, humans can sometimes survive periods of <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> exceeding one hour at temperatures below 20°C. [...] The prognosis is improved if <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> is caused by hypothermia rather than occurring prior to it; in 1999, 29-year-old Swedish woman Anna Bågenholm spent 80 minutes trapped in ice and survived with a near full recovery from a 13.7°C core body temperature. It is said in emergency medicine that [...] "nobody is dead until they are warm and dead."

[...] The combination of mildly reducing body temperature, reducing blood cell concentration, and increasing blood pressure after resuscitation was found especially effective—allowing for recovery of dogs after 12 minutes of <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> at normal body temperature with practically no brain injury. [...] The addition of a drug treatment protocol has been reported to allow recovery of dogs after 16 minutes of <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> at normal body temperature with no lasting brain injury.

2500|$|Although loss of {{function}} is almost immediate, there is no specific duration of <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> at which the non-functioning brain clearly dies.

[...] In {{other areas of the}} brain, viable human neurons have been recovered and grown in culture hours after <b>clinical</b> <b>death.</b> [...] Brain failure after <b>clinical</b> <b>death</b> is now known to be due to a complex series of processes called reperfusion injury that occur after blood circulation has been restored, especially processes that interfere with blood circulation during the recovery period.
