50|$|Specifically, {{the effect}} {{describes}} the phenomenon resulting from electrons and electron holes being squeezed into a dimension that approaches a critical quantum measurement, called the exciton Bohr radius. In current application, a quantum dot {{such as a}} small sphere <b>confines</b> <b>in</b> three dimensions, a quantum wire <b>confines</b> <b>in</b> two dimensions, and a quantum well <b>confines</b> only <b>in</b> one dimension. These are also known as zero-, one- and two-dimensional potential wells, respectively.

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{this period}} Windsor Castle became a place of royal confinement. In 1788 the king first became ill during a dinner at Windsor Castle; {{diagnosed}} as suffering from madness, he was removed for a period to the White House at Kew, where he temporarily recovered. After relapses in 1801 and 1804, his condition became enduring from 1810 onwards and he was <b>confined</b> <b>in</b> the State Apartments of Windsor Castle, with building work on the castle ceasing the following year.|$|E
5|$|Before their extinction, adapiform {{primates}} {{were primarily}} found across North America, Asia, and Europe, {{with a few}} species in Africa. They flourished during the Eocene when those regions were more tropical in nature, and they disappeared when the climate became cooler and drier. Today, the lemuriforms are <b>confined</b> <b>in</b> the tropics, ranging between 28°S to 26°N latitude. Lorises are found both in equatorial Africa and Southeast Asia, while the galagos are limited to the forests and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. Lemurs are endemic to Madagascar, although much of their diversity and habitat has been lost due to recent human activity.|$|E
5|$|Captain Archer is <b>confined</b> <b>in</b> a Cargo bay, and {{the aliens}} are unconvinced that Enterprise carries no {{currency}} or valuable materials.

5|$|When {{the order}} to {{withdraw}} from the field came later that evening from General McDowell, the 11th New York served as a rearguard. It was during this retreat that the regiment saw its heaviest casualties. Although accounts of the battle differ, most sources list 177 men lost at Bull Run, with 35 men killed, 74 wounded, and another 68 missing and presumed captured. Those that were taken prisoner were initially <b>confined</b> <b>in</b> Richmond. In September, they were transferred to Castle Pinckney, South Carolina, where they remained until they were paroled the following May.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the regular}} courts handled {{political}} cases and even issued death sentences for these cases, {{a new type}} of court, the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court), was established in 1934 to deal with politically important matters. This court handed out over 5,000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945. The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist, printing seditious leaflets or even making jokes about Hitler or other top party officials. Nazi Germany employed three types of capital punishment: hanging, decapitation and death by shooting. The Gestapo was in charge of investigative policing to enforce National Socialist ideology as they located and confined political offenders, Jews and others deemed undesirable. Political offenders who were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by the Gestapo and <b>confined</b> <b>in</b> a concentration camp.|$|E

After being reprimanded, Fletcher arranges a dinner date with Scully at Mulder's apartment. Meanwhile, Mulder is <b>confined</b> <b>in</b> a cell next to the mind-switched Lana Chee. Military police arrive and take Mulder to a meeting with General Wegman, Grodin and Smoodge. They believe that Mulder-as-Fletcher was trying to defraud the FBI, not help them. Mulder bluffs his way through the meeting, and claims that the real proof is safe and that he did not tell them about the scheme because he did not know if he could trust his colleagues, thinking any one of them could be the source of the leak. Mulder returns to Fletcher's house and tells Joanne Fletcher that he is Agent Fox Mulder, but Joanne thinks her husband must be undergoing a mid-life crisis.|$|E

5|$|Eyre and {{the crew}} were landed and marched to Antibes, where they were imprisoned with the crew of a Sardinian frigate that had been {{captured}} the day before Speedy. The crew had been imprisoned on Martin's flagship Sans Culotte and had been severely treated, with their captain, Ross, not being allowed to wash or shave. The British were placed in a dungeon at Antibes, with only straw to lie on, awaiting {{the decision of the}} authorities. After three weeks in this state, they were marched to Aix-en-Provence and were <b>confined</b> <b>in</b> the prison there. After a month imprisoned in Aix, Maximilien Robespierre fell and the Reign of Terror came to an end. The British were paroled. Eyre and the officers were taken to Romans, in Dauphiné where Eyre remained until May 1795 when he was released in exchange for a French officer. He faced a court-martial for the loss of Speedy, but was honourably acquitted.|$|E
5|$|His reign {{was marked}} by the {{reversal}} of his predecessor's conservative policy; he abolished taxes for poorer people, repealed penal laws which restricted Jews and discontinued public executions. The Medici were wanting in male heirs; his father, Cosimo III, wanted the Electress Palatine to succeed Gian Gastone. However, Spain, Great Britain, Austria and the Dutch Republic disregarded Cosimo's plan and appointed Charles of Spainwhose mother, Elisabeth Farnese, was a great-granddaughter of Margherita de' MediciGian Gastone's heir. Charles later transferred his claim to Francis Stephen of Lorraine pursuant to a preliminary peace that was finalized in 1738. Francis Stephen duly succeeded at Gian Gastone's demise, on 9 July 1737, ending almost 300 years of Medici rule over Florence.

5|$|In Belarus, {{the right}} to vote in {{elections}} and plebiscites is extended to those who are above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can issue an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast a ballot. Second, a person being held in detention or <b>confined</b> <b>in</b> a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution says nothing about the voting rights of those who have served their prison terms, nor does it state how those citizens gain the rights back.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe bulk {{dynamics}} of immiscible polymer blends during flow is relatively well understood, {{especially when the}} system contains Newtonian components. Recently, {{a number of studies}} have focused on flow of immiscible blends <b>in</b> <b>confined</b> geometries. <b>In</b> that case, the morphology development is not only affected by the material characteristics and the type of flow, but also by the degree of confinement. Here, we present an overview on the morphology development in immiscible two-phase blends <b>in</b> <b>confined</b> shear flow. Firstly, we focus on the typical microstructures that are observed <b>in</b> <b>confined</b> dilute blends. Secondly, in order to understand those peculiar morphologies, the systematic studies on single droplets <b>in</b> <b>confined</b> shear flow are reviewed. In addition to the experimental work, theoretical, phenomenological, and numerical models that include the effects of confinement are discussed...|$|R
5|$|In Greece, the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS {{encountered}} {{resistance from}} the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and Greek Army. The fighting was intensified by the mountainous terrain, with its heavily defended narrow passes. The LSSAH was {{at the forefront of}} the German push. The BEF evacuated by sea to Crete, but had to flee again in late May when the Germans arrived. Like Yugoslavia, the conquest of Greece brought its Jews into danger, as the Nazis immediately took a variety of measures against them. Initially <b>confined</b> <b>in</b> ghettos, most were transported to Auschwitz concentration camp in March 1943, where they were killed in the gas chambers on arrival. Of Greece's 80,000 Jews, only 20 percent survived the war.|$|E
