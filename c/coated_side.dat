50|$|There are {{alternatives}} to traditional types of DFB lasers. Traditionally, DFBs are antireflection coated {{on one side}} of the cavity and coated for high reflectivity on the other side (AR/HR). In this case the grating forms the distributed mirror on the antireflection <b>coated</b> <b>side,</b> while the semiconductor facet on the high reflectivity side forms the other mirror. These lasers generally have higher output power since the light is taken from the AR side, and the HR side prevents power being lost from the back side. Unfortunately, during the manufacturing of the laser and the cleaving of the facets, it is virtually impossible to control at which point in the grating the laser cleaves to form the facet. So sometimes the laser HR facet forms at the crest of the grating, sometimes on the slope. Depending on the phase of the grating and the optical mode, the laser output spectrum can vary. Frequently, the phase of the highly reflective side occurs at a point where two longitudinal modes have the same cavity gain, and thus the laser operates at two modes simultaneously. Thus such AR/HR lasers have to be screened at manufacturing and parts that are multimode or have poor side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) have to be scrapped. Additionally, the phase of the cleave affects the wavelength, and thus controlling the output wavelength of a batch of lasers in manufacturing can be a challenge.|$|E

40|$|Solar sails {{have the}} {{potential}} to benefit many future space exploration missions, but they lack the heritage required for present-day use. To grow confidence in solar sail technology, they could be deployed on LEO satellites higher than 600 km to help de-orbit the satellite within 25 years upon mission termination. To determine how atomic oxygen would affect the solar sail, material from Lightsail- 2 was tested in a thermal-energy, isotropic, atomic oxygen vacuum chamber based in the space environments laboratory in California Polytechnic State University. The sail material, aluminized Mylar, was tested for its survivability on both the coated and uncoated side, as well as tested for the optical degradation of the <b>coated</b> <b>side.</b> The uncoated side was found to be completely eroded after a fluence of 2. 27 x 1020 atoms/cm 2, or ~ 40 days in International Space Station orbit. The <b>coated</b> <b>side</b> experienced no mass loss, but signs of significant undercutting were found with a fluence of 1. 19 x 1021 atoms/cm 2, or ~ 200 days at station orbit. The stitches present on the <b>coated</b> <b>side,</b> meant to prevent tear propagation, eroded before the sample experienced a fluence of 4. 13 x 1020 atoms/cm 2, or ~ 70 days at station orbit. The average total reflectivity of the material dropped by ~ 5 % after atomic oxygen exposure, however no correlation with fluence was found. Average specular reflectivity remained unchanged after atomic oxygen exposure. The reflectivity results were impacted by wrinkling in the material, which was found to have a much larger impact than atomic oxygen exposure. These results were paired with an optimal de-orbit trajectory algorithm, developed in this thesis, to determine how atomic oxygen would affect a solar sail deployed to de-orbit an 800 km LEO satellite with a ballistic coefficient of 0. 1. Using a simplified 2 D orbit case, {{it was found that the}} satellite would de-orbit within 12 - 18 years, depending primarily on the solar activity level. The measured worst-case for optical degradation increased de-orbit time by ~ 6 months. Additionally, assuming that the sail material was perfectly reflecting decreased de-orbit time by 2 - 4 years. The amount of fluence required to erode the uncoated Mylar, and the amount required to erode the stitches, were both reached long before the satellite re-entered. It is therefore recommended that the solar sail minimize uncoated side exposure to atomic oxygen, and a more atomic oxygen-resistant stitch material be found. The fluence required to produce significant material undercutting was reached only once the satellite’s orbit had degraded to below 400 km. But the undercutting was observed to structurally compromise the material; thus, future LEO solar sail mission designers must take care when balancing added performance with higher failure risk when considering the tension in the deployed sail...|$|E

The <b>coated</b> <b>side</b> of the substrate was intentionally positioned in two directions of face {{and back to the}} zinc sources. Structure, morphology and optical properties of the samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra and room temperature photoluminescence measurements. The results showed that the samples on the different substrates with different directions have three different morphologies, including film-, rod- and comb-like nanostructures. Photoluminescence spectra of the samples showed the various bands centered in UV (380 - 390 nm), blue (470 - 490 nm), green (500 - 550 nm) and orange (610 - 620 nm) region.

40|$|The {{increase}} of cutting performance of knifes attempt {{to enhance the}} abrasion resistance of the edge, for example with coatings. Nowadays there are sporadic applications using hardened steel knifes for non-shape cutting, which use a coating of Titanium, Chromium or Titanium aluminium nitride. Thereby are friction minimizing and abrasion protection more important than cutting performance enhancement. The paper describes the results of studies with coated knives which use a super hard Diamond Like Carbon coating (DLC). The trials show that the amorphous carbon coating improves the cutting output of hardened knives. The {{research shows that the}} cutting performance of technical knives can be enhanced through coatings. The amorphous hydrogen-free carbon coating obviously improves the cutting output of hardened stainless steel knives. Coated machine-guided paper knives show a double cutting performance compared to uncoated knifes. Furthermore the tests have not been performed to the end so the difference in practice might be higher than the test results in laboratory. By the coated samples the aimed sharpness protecting effect occurs. The protection of one edge side leads to wear on the uncoated side thus minimize the widing of the edge breadth. Therefore the sharpness of th coated knife stays on longer. To achieve such good results it was very important to produce a very adhesive coating. For that reason the pre-treatment of the sample before coating has been adjusted for this special base material. The micro edged geometry and the coating properties have to be adapted for each application. An integrated view which takes all those parameters into consideration fails. Even though the results show that coatings can improve the cutting performance of hardened knives, {{further research is needed to}} understand the adhesion problems of the coatings at the small edge. The behaviour of the <b>coated</b> <b>side</b> is different to the free surfaces because of its unequal properties. The influence of the roughness and the sharping method is not scientifically defined. The effect to the <b>coated</b> <b>side</b> adhesion is not quite clear and subject of further research.

40|$|Water and {{supercritical}} {{carbon dioxide}} have different wetting angles to a glass surface, where water has a lower angle. In a microfluidic channel, the lower wetting angle draws the water to surround the {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} and the supercritical carbon dioxide therefore easily form droplets or segments if the flow rate is low. In this study, the flow of supercritical carbon dioxide and water has been studied in a microfluidic system with a double Y-channel. The micro channels have been built in borofloat glass to withstand high mechanical and chemical forces, still enabling in situ characterization. The aim has been to analyze flow changes {{in the water and}} supercritical carbon dioxide in structured channels with and without surface modification.             The result shows that the flow regime of supercritical carbon dioxide and water can be controlled by changing flow rates, adding walls, or coating a channel as well as any combination of these three. If adding a large enough wall in a channel, the flow will be segmented only in half the channel at moderate flow rates from both sources, and parallel if the flow rate of supercritical carbon dioxide is high enough. A non-polar coating of half a channel will make the supercritical carbon dioxide flow along the <b>coated</b> <b>side</b> and supercritical carbon dioxide can by that way be forced to only take one of the outlets. However, still water exit at both outlets...|$|E
40|$|A {{development}} effort underway {{at the time}} of reporting the information for this article is devoted to increasing the sensitivity of microchannel plates (MCPs) as detectors of photons and ions by coating the MCPs with nitrides of elements in period III of the periodic table. Conventional MCPs are relatively insensitive to slowly moving, large-mass ions for example, ions of biomolecules under analysis in mass spectrometers. The idea underlying this development is to coat an MCP to reduce its work function (decrease its electron affinity) in order to increase both (1) the emission of electrons in response to impingement of low-energy, large-mass ions and (2) the multiplying effect of secondary electron emission. Of particular interest as coating materials having appropriately low or even negative electron affinities are gallium nitride, aluminum nitride, and ternary alloys of general composition Al(x) Ga(1 -x) N (where 0 <x< 1). These materials exhibit attractively high degrees of chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability plus acceptably high resistance to sputtering. The electron-excitation cross sections of these materials are expected to exceed those of several other materials (including diamond) that are, variously, in use or under development for the same purpose. Moreover, by doping these materials with silicon, one can render them partly electrically conductive, thereby suppressing the undesired accumulation of electric charge that could otherwise occur during bombardment by ions. For experiments, thin films of AlN and GaN both undoped and doped with Si were deposited on commercial MCPs by radio-frequency molecular-beam epitaxy (also known as plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy) at temperatures < 200 C. This deposition technique is particularly suitable because (1) MCPs cannot withstand the higher deposition-substrate temperatures used to decompose constituent compounds in some other deposition techniques and (2) in this technique, the constituent Al, Ga, and N are supplied in elemental form, so that {{there is no need for}} thermal decomposition at the substrate surface. The nitride films thus formed were, variously, amorphous or polycrystalline. The nitride films were coated with surface layers of gold < 100 thick. The MCPs were tested in a standard configuration in which the output stage of a first MCP was coupled to the input stage of a second MCP. Each pair of MCPs was mounted in a standard holder that included front and back contact rings and an anode for collecting the output electrons of the second MCP. The MCP pairs were biased at potentials between 1. 7 and 1. 9 kV, and count rates measured after preamplification and discrimination. To enable a direct comparison, in one pair, the second MCP was uncoated while the first MCP was coated over half its surface. The coated and uncoated sides of the half-coated MCP were exposed to fluxes of argon ions at kinetic energies of 1. 0 and 0. 5 keV. At 1. 0 keV, the count rate for the <b>coated</b> <b>side</b> was about 2. 3 times greater than that for the uncoated side; at 0. 5 keV, the count rate for the <b>coated</b> <b>side</b> was about 1. 8 times greater than that for the uncoated side...|$|E

A powder primer coat of approximately 2 mils was applied using a conventional corona electrostatic powder sprayer, and then the high build topcoat was applied directly over the dry primer coat using the same technique to a thickness of about 10 mils. The primer and first topcoat were then cured at an elevated temperature. Subsequent layers of topcoat were hot flocked until a final coating thickness of 60 mils was achieved. To determine the effective thermal conductivity of the coated steel, an apparatus consisting of three contact thermocouples, a hot plate, and polystyrene foam panels was assembled. The hot plate was heated to a constant temperature, then the room temperature coated steel plate was placed under the polystyrene insulation on the hot plate, <b>coated</b> <b>side</b> up. The temperature of both sides of the coated plate was then measured for 30 minutes. The heat flux was then calculated through the bare steel plate.
