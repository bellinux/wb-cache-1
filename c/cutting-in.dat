60|$|After having towed our whale to the ship, <b>cutting-in</b> was {{immediately}} begun. First, the carcass was secured near {{the head and}} tail with chains, and made fast to the ship; then the great blocks and ropes fastened to the main and foremast for hoisting in the blubber were brought into play. When all was ready, the captain and the two mates, with Tom Lokins, got upon the whale's body, with long-handled sharp spades or digging-knives. With these they fell to work cutting off the blubber.|$|E

60|$|One day I was {{standing}} beside the windlass, listening to the conversation {{of five or six}} of the men, who were busy sharpening harpoons and cutting-knives, or making all kinds of toys and things out of whales' bones. We had just finished <b>cutting-in</b> and trying out our third whale, and as it was not long since we reached the fishing-ground, we were in high hopes of making a good thing of it that season; so that every one was in good spirits, from the captain down to the youngest man in the ship.|$|E

But more wonderful still were his stories of the cod, and how they argued and reasoned on their private businesses deep down below the keel.|$|E
6000|$|In {{addition}} to those fine engravings from Garnery, {{there are two other}} French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself [...] "H. Durand." [...] One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background, both drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine, when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving is quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in {{the very heart of the}} Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the act of <b>cutting-in)</b> hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen.|$|E
60|$|In {{the tumultuous}} {{business}} of <b>cutting-in</b> and attending to a whale, {{there is much}} running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place; for at {{one and the same}} time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale's back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster's back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume-- a shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.|$|E

50|$|Decalcification is {{a lengthy}} procedure, as bone pieces {{have to be}} left in the decalcifying agent for several days or even weeks, {{depending}} on the size of the bone. Traditional methods of handling hard tissues, i.e. bone and teeth, usually present a problem to both the pathologist and histotechnologist. Many of the grossing and <b>cutting-in</b> techniques in current usage for these tissues dictate the use of gross sectioning procedures with a high-speed saw and/or long periods in a decalcifying solution, prior to reducing the specimen to a size that can be easily processed, embedded and sectioned. Frequently the poor quality thin sections obtained when these methods are employed contribute to the already difficult task of evaluating the pathology and making a correct diagnosis. With the introduction of Low Speed Saws, it is now possible to routinely and rapidly reduce undecalcified surgical specimens of hard tissue, to a thickness of 2-3 mm, without compromising the integrity of the tissue.|$|E
50|$|The narrowest colloquial {{sense of}} the term {{reserves}} it only for machines that perform metal <b>cutting—in</b> other words, the many kinds of conventional machining and grinding.

However, economists use a slightly broader sense that also includes metal deformation of other types that squeeze the metal into shape without cutting off swarf, such as rolling, stamping with dies, shearing, swaging, riveting, and others. Thus presses are usually included in the economic definition of machine tools. For example, this is the breadth of definition used by Max Holland in his history of Burgmaster and Houdaille, which is also a history of the machine tool industry in general from the 1940s through the 1980s; he was reflecting the {{sense of the}} term used by Houdaille itself and other firms in the industry.

Even more significantly, Cutting addresses the issue of collaborative composition, what kind of labor collaboration entails, and how it differs from and yet draws upon her previous experience" [...] (61-62). Cutting argued that she should be paid more than the $300 offered because creating a single chapter within an already established storyline required more labor than had she come up with the entire idea on her own and because she would have to work harder at making her chapter complement those of other, more established authors.|$|E

Etching and cutting under water provide better tolerances and smaller heat-affected zone widths and avoid the re-deposition of debris. Irradiation under water results in increased wetting of fluoropolymers, and laser ablation in water vapor provides deposition of highly crystalline hydroxyapatite coatings. Laser irradiation of solid targets in water has been used to fabricate Ag, Au, Ni, Cu and carbon nanoparticles. The results of an original study on the formation of free-standing high aspect ratio PbðZrxTi 1 xÞO 3 microplates fabricated by laser irradiation of PbðZrxTi 1 xÞO 3 ceramics in water are also reported.

40|$|In {{conversational}} studies, various {{authors have}} noticed that simultaneous talk does not only occur {{as the result of}} an unintentional overlapping transition but also as the result of intentional <b>cutting-in</b> while the current speaker has not yet reached the proximity of the end of their turn.

Focusing on excerpts taken from a political interview (Hardtalk) and a talk show (The Oprah Winfrey show) this study intends to account for the attitudinal processes that embody these two speech events by comparing the management of turn taking as seen in the phenomenon of overlapping. The main objectives are to observe and describe how collaborative or non-collaborative the interviewer and interviewee’s attitudes are as reflected in the negotiation of turns and how this may be influenced by the type of TV genre. It is proposed that the political interview with its conflicting character differs in the management of turn-taking behaviour from non-conflictive interviews such as talk shows, where overlaps, being collaborative in nature, display positive attitudes such as agreement, willingness to give detail, and acknowledgement from both the interviewer and interviewee...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT−This paper {{proposes a}} stereo vision-based forward {{obstacle}} detection and distance measurement method. In general, stereo vision-based obstacle detection methods in automotive applications {{can be classified}} into two categories: IPM (Inverse Perspective Mapping) -based and disparity histogram-based. The existing disparity histogram-based method was developed for stop-and-go applications. The proposed method extends {{the scope of the}} disparity histogram-based method to highway applications by 1) replacing the fixed rectangular ROI (Region Of Interest) with the traveling lanebased ROI, and 2) replacing the peak detection with a constant threshold with peak detection using the threshold-line and peakness evaluation. In order to increase the true positive rate while decreasing the false positive rate, multiple candidate peaks were generated and then verified by the edge feature correlation method. By testing the proposed method with images captured on the highway, it was shown that the proposed method was able to overcome problems in previous implementations while being applied successfully to highway collision warning/avoidance conditions. In addition, comparisons with laser radar showed that vision sensors with a wider FOV (Field Of View) provided faster responses to <b>cutting-in</b> vehicles. Finally, we integrated the proposed method into a longitudinal collision avoidance system. Experimental results showed that activated braking by risk assessment using the state of the ego-vehicle and measuring the distance to upcoming obstacles could successfully prevent collisions...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation {{is to find a}} solution to the critical problems such as the increase in friction and wear that may occur to the stand-by diesel engine for phase I units at Dr. Sharief Power Station due to engine rundown with low pressurized lubricating oil caused by the non operation of the pre-priming pump and low speed of engine mechanical oil pump. The study suggests a solution to these problems by allowing the <b>cutting-in</b> of pre-priming pump during engine rundown. Although the manufacturer assured the operation of the pre-priming pump during engine rundown, but it was verified that this pump failed to operate automatically or manually during the engine rundown when it was tested periodically. The relevant data for the pre-priming pump has been collected from the operating and maintenance instruction manuals for the stand-by diesel engine for phase I units at Dr. Sharief Power Station. The collected data on the existing pre-priming pump was analyzed in conformity with the manufacturer's recommendations and it was found that this pump was not following the normal operating procedure for heavy duty and high speed diesel engines.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of human settling Samarskaya Luka (Volga bend) area {{adjacent to the}} Zhiguli archaeological site and burial ground has been studied by analyzing both the cultural layer of the monument and the soil strata in the adjacent ravine. Seven erosion and accumulation cycles have been distinguished in the ravine development during the Holocene, correlated with periods of the water catchment area development. Each cycle used to start with forest fires, leading {{to an increase in}} runoff and ravine <b>cutting-in,</b> and to complete with surface stabilization as grassland or forest was reestablished. The length of periods between changes of land use varied from a few decades in the agricultural cycles of the early Middle Ages, up to several hundred years in the nomadic-pastoral cycles of the Eneolithic – the Bronze Age, the Iron Age and the late Middle Ages. Vegetation changed within each cycle, as human utilization of the watershed resulted in elimination of the understory, reduction of tree species variety, an increase in the proportion of conifers, and, due to combination of fire and grazing, led to deforestation. A lengthy deforestation period occurred in the mid-Holocene (Eneolithic – early Bronze Age). A new period of progressive deforestation and open space growth started {{in the middle of the}} 1 st millennium AD. Discontinuities in human occupation lasting a few hundred years observed in the mid-Holocene.

40|$|Historical Context The idea {{to install}} one-way circulatory traffic {{management}} on intersections was struck around 1900, {{both in the}} USA and Europe. The devisers regarded the principle of merging and weaving essential for the rotary system and, in practice, right of way {{had not yet been}} regulated unambiguously. This resulted in traffic circles performing worse than the devisers had in mind. In the early sixties (20 th century) in the United Kingdom, the rule of giving priority to circulatory traffic was discovered to have significant advantages since the change in the traffic operation it enabled roundabouts to be kept small enough to handle a lot of traffic safely. Instead of facilitating merging and weaving at high speed, drivers had no option but to accept a break in the circulatory traffic flow. Systematic research, initiated by Franck Blackmore (1916 - 2008) in the sixties, got this insight worldwide attention. The modern Dutch roundabout is a variation on the British roundabout. In the UK tangential approaches and exits are normally applied, with radial approaches the exceptional when {{there is a lack of}} space in built-up areas. On the other hand, in the Netherlands both the approaches and exits are radial, to such an extent that these have become a distinctive feature in the Dutch definition of a roundabout. In the Netherlands the building of the first modern roundabout was initiated by Kars Erné (1932 - 2010). In addition to the two features mentioned (priority to roundabout traffic and radial connecting legs) the single-lane circulatory roadway has made this modern roundabout a success. The concept for ‘sustainable safety’ offered the road owners a new grip on improving road safety. At many spots, the modern single-lane roundabout is the safest type of intersection but where larger volumes of traffic have to be handled, the compact two-lane roundabout was developed, based on the same concentric design principle as the single-lane roundabout, but handling two lanes of traffic. However, this configuration again introduces the necessity to weave. To avoid serious <b>cutting-in</b> conflicts in the Netherlands and Germany it was recommended to provide the departure leg with a single lane. However, this does not eliminate weave conflicts. Turbo Roundabout based on Sustainable Safety Principle In 1996 the challenge to the author was to develop a two-lane roundabout without weaving conflicts. This study shows that the consistent application of the principles of sustainable safety leads to a safe design of the Turbo Roundabout. Striving for recognisable points of conflict determines the choice of the main shape. But also the design of a detail such as the roundabout shield is largely determined by this principle. Another principle of sustainable safety is realising homogeneity by reducing speed, which leads to the introduction of lane-dividers. The principle of forgivingness is the basis of the mountable shape of the lane-dividers. Design Methodology The spiral shape of turbo roundabouts can be designed using circles with staggered central points. This is made possible by the low driving speed, and it offers a route with fewer steering movements for the driver. Safety is the factor in limiting the number of yielding roundabout lanes to no more than two. This leads to the need to tailor different types of turbo roundabouts to different traffic volume patterns. The number of circle segments on which a couple of lanes have to be continued determines the shape of the turboblock: the way the circle centres are staggered depends on the question the circulating lanes have to shift up one lane outwards over one, two, three or four segments. Requirements Signposting and Lane Marking The principle that drivers choose the correct lane on the approach leg is fundamental to the turbo roundabout. To this end a coherent system of lane arrows (Dutch roundabout arrows analogue to fishhook arrows) on both the road surface and on signposts has been developed. Because the approach lanes to turbo roundabouts tend to be short, it is useful to inform the drivers about the lane division before they reach the point at which they must make a choice. Hence the development of a new type of switch signpost option to the approach lane. Capacity Research Turbo Roundabout To choose the right type of turbo roundabout in a pre-evaluation, in 2000 the MULTI-LANE ROUNDABOUT EXPLORER was developed. Initially this model was of a rather synthetic nature but later it became possible to carry out a simple calibration. Only in 2007 it was possible to do more extended capacity measurements on a turbo roundabout (in Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel) In the literature two types of model are mentioned to determine the capacity of roundabouts: linear models and exponential models based on gap acceptance theory. The parameters of the first type of model can only be estimated at traffic flow level. The gap acceptance theory is based on the assumption that the behavioural parameters (the critical gap, the follow-on time and the minimum headway) can be estimated at vehicle level, by which the capacity is to be determined. Because the pseudo-conflict (caused by vehicles leaving the roundabout via the opposite leg direction) plays a part on Dutch roundabouts, in the latter method it is necessary to have access to measurements in a saturation situation. In analysing the different data sources (at vehicle level and traffic flow level) it was found that the estimation of vehicle level based parameters corresponds with the results based on the traffic flow level whereas in more complex situations this is not longer the case. In spite of this deficiency in the present gap acceptance theory, it is possible to gain better results with a model based on this theory than with a linear model, provided that the parameters are adjusted for traffic flow measurements under saturation conditions. Further research will be necessary to determine which of the underlying assumptions of the gap acceptance models are accountable for these deficiencies. The findings of this study reveal that for the time being it is necessary, also for this reason, to employ a method of estimation that incorporates both data at vehicle level (gap observations) and observations at circulation level (five-minute observations) in a saturation situation. The functions found make it possible to compare the capacity of turbo roundabouts with the results of measurements on compact two-lane roundabouts in Germany. These data confirm the findings of the MULTI-LANE ROUNDABOUT EXPLORER: the fact that traffic on the turbo roundabout makes better use of the inner roundabout lane, the capacity will be higher than that of a compact two-lane roundabout.

These data confirm the findings of the MULTI-LANE ROUNDABOUT EXPLORER: the fact that traffic on the turbo roundabout makes better use of the inner roundabout lane, the capacity will be higher than that of a compact two-lane roundabout. Possibilities of a Roundabout Metering Signal The turbo roundabout is designed for operating without traffic lights, just as single-lane roundabouts. Nevertheless, the possibility to expand the capacity of turbo roundabouts by applying signalisation was examined but concluded that a fully signalised turbo roundabout with four legs will not offer any higher capacity than without signals. However, both analysis and simulation found that a roundabout metering signal (RMS) not only results in a more fair distribution of waiting time during peak periods but will also increase the capacity: the capacity of the left lane of the next connecting leg will increase from 15 % to 50 % without reducing the capacity of the leg on which the RMS is placed. Signalised Turbo Circle It is necessary to enlarge and change the shape of a roundabout to use full signalised equipment effectively. Starting from the radial connecting approach legs, the departure legs must exit the roundabout tangentially. The resulting shape is called a Turbo Circle. And for tailoring a traffic circle expressly to the application of traffic lights, it will be necessary for each lane to be reserved for one direction. For a turbo circle it is more important than for a turbo roundabout that a driver is able to choose the right lane in time. As for handling traffic volumes, this will mostly require short selection lanes – shorter than the approach legs of a signalised intersection with the same number of lanes. But to gain a good overview of the many lanes (mostly more than four), it is necessary all the same for the selection lanes are sufficiently long that two signpost portals can be situated behind each other. In addition to this pre-lane switch, signposts are needed in advance of the actual selection lanes to inform the drivers how to switch lane to the selected destination. Also, roundabout arrows over a 180 m stretch on a two-lane approach leg will significantly improve the process of lane switching later on. An analytical model has been derived to compare the cycle times of a turbo circle and a four-leg intersection (with the same number of lanes: in every direction two lanes). From that it may be concluded that a turbo circle proves its usefulness in situations with high traffic volumes. Above 6, 000 pcu/h the cycle time of a turbo circle tends to be lower than half of that of a four-leg intersection. Then the total capacity will also be higher under the proviso that two opposite left-turn volumes are not higher than 130 % to 160 % of the straight-on volumes of these legs. Safety of the Turbo Roundabout Finally, the safety and perception of turbo roundabouts as well as turbo circles have been investigated. The safety of the turbo roundabouts was researched in 2005 by a pre and post study also involving single-lane roundabouts, which necessitates the results of these comparisons to be corrected with certain factors. From literature it is known that without calculating regression-to-the-mean and trends in the overall safety effects, the general safety effects of measurements will be overestimated. In addition, the 2005 study proved that not only the incidental but also the structural differences in risk setting will influence the priority of safety measurements, so measures will have been taken for the most dangerous spots. It has been possible to determine that for the single-lane roundabouts a correction of the accident victims must be reduced from 82. 9 % to 68. 3 % to get a good figure of the effectiveness of replacing four-legged (mostly two-way-stop) crossings by single-lane roundabouts. The replacement of intersections by turbo roundabouts has shown a surprisingly high reduction of 82 %. The observation time was too short to define the structural component of the effect of the prioritising process by officials, but it is not expected to be less than that for the single-lane roundabouts. Applying the corrections for regression-to-the-mean and the trends in the overall safety effects in the number of injury crashes by turbo roundabout replacements, the reduction percentage of 82 % has to be reduced to 76. 1 %. This is comparable with the figure of 71. 8 % in the United States for replacement by concentric two-lane roundabouts. Although this is a smaller reduction, this is not a statistically significant difference. But what is striking is the difference in reduction of the total number of accidents by concentric two-lane roundabouts in the US (18 %) and by turbo roundabouts (49 %, in this case not corrected). Investigation of the perception of the turbo roundabout and the turbo circle In 1999 a survey of users of the turbo roundabout in the shape of a bone-roundabout was carried out. The score for clarity of the Coldenhove turbo bone-roundabout was 73 % for private car drivers and 87 % for truck drivers, a result that can be regarded as positive. In terms of the possibility or otherwise for lane changing, this roundabout is a model for turbo roundabouts built later on, so a similar survey was not repeated for other turbo roundabouts. In unrecorded observations ‘left-turn, short-cut’ manoeuvres were ascertained, which led to a change at the start of the inner circulatory lane of later turbo roundabouts. Private car users of the Doenkadeplein turbo circle judged the route clarity on the circle itself as 52. 5 % while truck drivers score it 76. 9 %, a less positive result than the turbo roundabout. The private car user score in particular prompted improvements to be proposed to both the signing and marking of the turbo circle, and these have been incorporated in the recommendations of chapter 5. New Pre-Signpost In many discussions with users of the turbo roundabout as well as the turbo circle, the aspect of choosing the right lane in time has been mentioned as the main point of critique. Combined with the conspicuous low rate of the surveyability of the lane selection in the approach of the Doenkadeplein, this prompted a change from the general roundabout pre-signpost into a pre-lane switch signpost for the turbo roundabout and the turbo circle. In Conclusion Summarising, it can be stated that the application of sustainable safety principles really leads to a more safe design of a multi-lane roundabout combined with the possibility to handle greater traffic volumes. Meanwhile, it has to be realised that the turbo principle demands more attention to lane selection on distributor roads than road users are used to. An alternative for the pre-signpost has been developed to stimulate better lane selection and this will be incorporated in the national guideline for signposting. Further Research Some questions could not be answered in the context of this study. Therefore recommendations for further research include:  In the surveys not all traffic flows – in the form of an origin-destination matrix – on a roundabout have been recorded. Because of the strong indications that the influence of the pseudo conflicts depends on the question of whether the vehicles are coming from the leg ahead or the segment ahead, further roundabout surveys also need to record not only the lane use but also the legs of origin and destination.  The traffic flow data of the roundabouts surveyed did not allow to determine whether and how strongly a dominant flow from a single leg influences the capacity of the next entry. Further research that compares roundabouts data with a dominant flow from a single leg is recommended.  In 2008 the right-angled start of the inner circulatory lane was introduced (par 3. 5. 5). It is to be expected that not only the view from the right entry lane will be improved but also the overview on the left entry lane. An item for further research is the question of whether this will also expand the capacity of that left entry lane.  The positive effects of roundabout metering signals on the two-lane approach legs have been determined by analysis and simulation. The detector configuration, and especially the fine tuning/adjusting in practice, will be a matter of practical evidence so a corresponding pre and post survey is recommended.  The turbo circle was originally designed in a compact shape (with lane dividers 30 cm wide), based on the premise to apply LEDS in the road surface to guide the drivers in their lanes in the conflict areas. But at the moment of building the first turbo circles robust road surface LEDS were not available. Therefore, the turbo circles have been provided with wide splitter islands. But this diminishes their clarity and surveyability. Given the opinion of the car drivers the road surface LEDS are still welcome. On turbo circles with splitter islands, it will be possible to test the robustness of the road surface LEDS, without risking diminished functionality of the traffic circle. Once the robustness of the road surface LEDS has been established, they will also be applied on compact turbo circles.  Regarding the short period available for research on the safety of turbo roundabouts, a more extended survey is recommended, with a focus on the safety of bicycles and moped riders related to right-of-way. To reach the level of accuracy comparable with the results of the research on the safety of single-lane roundabouts in this study, the registration of traffic accidents in the Netherlands has to be improved...|$|E
