50|$|Lights were lit each evening, {{generally}} {{by means}} of a wick on a long pole. At dawn, they would return to put them out using a small hook on the same pole. Early street lights were generally candles, oil, and similar <b>consumable</b> <b>liquid</b> or solid lighting sources with wicks.|$|E
50|$|The engine's fuel {{chemistry}} used 80% {{hydrogen peroxide}} or 'T-Stoff'. This was a 'cold cycle' engine; the peroxide {{acted as a}} monopropellant and was decomposed by a catalyst into superheated steam and oxygen. The catalyst used was a <b>consumable</b> <b>liquid</b> solution of calcium permanganate or 'Z-Stoff'. As this catalyst is consumed, the engine {{is regarded as a}} bipropellant engine.|$|E
50|$|The product {{left after}} the cream is removed is called skim, or skimmed, milk. To make a <b>consumable</b> <b>liquid</b> {{a portion of}} cream is {{returned}} to the skim milk to make low fat milk (semi-skimmed) for human consumption. By varying the amount of cream returned, producers can make a variety of low-fat milks to suit their local market. Other products, such as calcium, vitamin D, and flavouring, are also added to appeal to consumers.|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} of {{three kinds of}} microorganisms under strongpulse electric field conditions was investigated with a possible application of the electric pulse method for sterilization of <b>consumable</b> <b>liquids.</b> The results of the investigations of survival ratio of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes) bacteria and yeastlike fungi (Candida albicans) are presented. The HV pulses with peak voltage U = 0 to 100 kV and rise time t, = 0. 5 to 1. 2 ps were applied. The microorganisms were suspended in an NaCl solution with 7 = 6 to 13 mS/cm conductivity and pH = 7. 2. The experimental setup and the dependency of the microorganism survival ratio on the rise time, peak voltage and {{on the number of}} pulses applied, are presented. It has been found that the lethal effect on microorganisms caused by HV pulses depends on the pulse parameters {{as well as on the}} kind of microorganism being treated...|$|R
30|$|In September of 2013, the Council of Europe {{passed a}} {{resolution}} for metals and alloys that {{come into contact with}} foodstuffs [23]. In this resolution, specific release limits (SRL) for metals and alloys, including aluminum, were proposed. As a basic principle, the release of metal should remain ‘As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA).’ An SRL specifies, the maximal amount of metal ions (in mg) may be transferred from a defined surface of the contact material to the food (in kg) or food simulant. Known toxicological aspects of the given metals are taken into account. The SRL for the release of aluminum to foodstuffs was specified to be 5.00  mg/kg foodstuff [23]. Data from monitoring programs for foods and food simulants by the food industry as well as from members of the Europe Community show that this value can be adhered to [23]. The SRL is also used by official control authorities. In the studies presented in this paper, <b>consumable</b> <b>liquids</b> were also tested, whereby the SRL for liquids will be presented in the unit mg/L.|$|R
40|$|The Laser Development Task of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's (PNNL) Remote Spectroscopy project (PL 211 I) {{is focused}} on the {{development}} of novel laser technology {{for a new generation of}} standoff and in-situ chemical sensors for detecting the proliferation of nuclear weapons. These lasers will improve the sensitivity, flexibility, or range of active standoff sensors, enable ultra-trace in situ sensors with enhanced selectivity, as well as greatly improve calibration of passive standoff sensors. In particular, laser transmitters with minimal size, weight, and power consumption (SWAP) are needed to meet the requirements for a variety of in situ or short-range stand-off sensors and sensors for small UAVs or other platforms. These laser transmitters need to be rugged and free of requirements for <b>consumables</b> such as <b>liquid</b> nitrogen. Many sensing techniques also require lasers that produce a single narrow wavelength (single longitudinal mode). Lasers that provide high continuous-wave (CW) output power on a single line at operating temperatures accessible with thermoelectric (TE) cooling are therefore essential for sensor applications...|$|R

40|$|Dark {{chocolate}} (DC) {{was originally}} introduced in human nutrition as a medicinal product <b>consumable</b> in a <b>liquid</b> form. Century-long efforts of food industry transformed this hardly appealing product into a valuable modern culinary delight with clear predominance of confectionery brands of DC on the market. However, current epidemiological data {{as well as}} multiple experimental and clinical observations reveal that DC consumption may {{have a profound effect}} on cardiovascular, central nervous systems, hemostasis, and lipid metabolism. However, despite of growing body of modern scientific evidence revealing medicinal properties of cocoa-based products, DC remains more gourmet culinary item than medicinal food product. Even today there are no clear dietary recommendations on consumption of cocoa flavonoids (flavanols) for health purpose. Clinical trials with DC rarely include monitoring of plasma flavanol concentration in volunteers. Moreover, there is no standardized assay or any quantitative requirements for flavanol content in the commercial brands of DC. High flavanol content is often sacrificed during manufacturing for a better taste of DC due to bitterness of cocoa flavonoids. All these problems including subsequently arising ethical issues need to be addressed by joint efforts of food industry and medical science. Moreover, application of microencapsulation technology in DC manufacturing, as well as molecular selection of best flavanol producers may drastically change bioavailability of DC bioactive ingredients and DC production technology. Nevertheless, only strict causative approach, linking possible health effect of DC to its bioactive ingredients considered as nutraceuticals, may change the current landscape in nutritional research related to cocoa-based products and create a trustworthy path for their medicinal use...|$|R
