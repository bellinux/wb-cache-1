He {{eventually}} confronts Clay {{with the fact that he}} has been shutting out the club and making decisions without their approval. Later on, Tig is shown in [...] "Burnt and Purged Away" [...] to have apparently given up on Clay and SAMCRO, refusing Clay's request for [...] "another guy with a gun" [...] with obvious indifference. However, that night when <b>Clay</b> is <b>gunned</b> down by Opie, the members are told it was done by two black men. Tig, feeling remorse for turning his back on his brother, takes responsibility for what happened and seeks Laroy (of the Niners) for retaliation. In a nervous frenzy, he runs down Laroy as he is having dinner outside of a restaurant. Tig misses Laroy, and instead hits Leroy's date (who happens to be the daughter of the most dangerous gangster in town, Damon Pope). Tig is then tailed by the Niners and Laroy, until the SOA meet up with him on the highway and escape. Tig is seen in the finale sitting at Clay's hospital bedside, as he continues to feel remorse for what happened. At the end of the finale, when Jax steps in as president of the club, Jax appoints Chibs as Sergeant-at-Arms.

50|$|While Henry is changing, Clay (Orlando Jones) {{knocks on}} the door, {{claiming}} that he had beached his boat {{on the island and}} is looking for help. Henry lets him in, but notices his odd behavior and a tattoo on his right arm. <b>Clay</b> pulls a <b>gun</b> on Henry, and tells him that his younger brother Decker was a SEAL under Henry's command who had been killed in the line of duty. Clay had heard that Decker was abandoned by his commanding officer, and wants Henry to pay for his death. Henry responds by explaining they had been ambushed, and he pulled out early to prevent risking the lives of more men. Just then, Kayla calls Henry's phone, telling him that she is running late. Clay shoots the phone and Henry takes the opportunity to attack Clay, who proves to be a skilled fighter and after a sustained fight, eventually knocks Henry unconscious. He drags him out into a nearby field and gives him a gun, ordering him to shoot himself. Henry refuses and says Decker's death wasn't his fault. Just as Clay is about to shoot Henry himself, Xander and his men show up on their boat, claiming to be ICE agents and questioning their presence. Henry sees through the ruse and runs. Xander's men fire at him, but Clay shoots back and manages to disable the diver. The gunfire is heard by two real ICE agents who are investigating the death of the others and head in its direction. Xander determines that his driver won't survive and smothers him to death. He recognizes Henry as ex-military, and resolves to force him to act as their diver so they can retrieve the plane's contents, a large shipment of heroin.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Gemma finds Jax's {{pregnant}} ex-wife Wendy Case {{collapsed in}} her home, and she rushes to the hospital. Dr. Tara Knowles {{tells him that}} track marks were found on Wendy's hands and feet, {{and that they had}} to perform an emergency C-section on her, leaving the baby ten weeks premature. Because of this, the baby has a heart defect and a tear in his abdomen. The latter is from Wendy's drug abuse, but the former problem is likely a genetic defect. Together, both defects are near-fatal. The baby has just a 20% chance of survival. Jax and Tara were high school sweethearts, and she personally requested to help on his case. Jax decides not to visit his baby boy, named Abel, and instead flees the hospital. He then goes to a local bar with Bobby and Chibs and beats Wendy's dealer, {{who is a member of}} the Nordics gang, repeatedly with a pool cue. Later on, he visits Opie Winston, a former SOA member who was recently released from prison and promised his wife and children that he would never return. Jax convinces Opie to ride along with him the next day, however. Jax later returns to visit Wendy in the hospital, who promises she'll get clean. She also says the doctors told her Abel is getting stronger, but she is facing a charge of fetal abuse as she has a stash drawer at home. She asks him to get rid of the stash before she faces time in jail. Jax turns up at his house, which he finds his mother feverishly cleaning. Jax tells her that Abel is going to die, which angers Gemma, who slaps him and tells him that he is the only one his son has. Jax asks her about his father's original vision of the club and she responds that it was to create a brotherhood and a family. Jax tells her about the writings he found, how his father wanted a social rebellion, not an outlaw club. When she leaves, Jax flushes Wendy's stash down the toilet and takes her <b>gun.</b> <b>Clay</b> and Gemma begin to worry that Jax is abandoning the club and what it stands for. The next day, Clay, Jax and Bobby meet Ernest Darby, the Nordics' leader, and tell him never to bring methamphetamine or any other drug into Charming again. That night, as they prepare to go and get their guns back from San Leandro, Jax tells Opie not to come because of the situation with his family and Bobby is occupied performing his Elvis act at a club in Lake Tahoe. When they arrive at the industrial storage warehouse and find the guns, three Mayans turn up in a car outside. Clay and Chibs then shoot and kill the Mayans and another man, who has a number of Nazi and White supremacist tattoos. He was a member of the Nordics, a local skinhead gang allied with the Mayans, and it later emerges that his name was Whistler. Jax was also armed but hit a mental barrier before he could fire a shot. They then escape with the weapons and destroy the building using explosives.|$|R
