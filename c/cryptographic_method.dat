Earlier cryptographic schemes for secret sharing lead to high computational complexity during both secret sharing and secret reconstruction phase. Today, various <b>cryptographic</b> <b>methods</b> for secret sharing are there to protect secret data but everything depends on the protection of encryption key. But, most of the available <b>cryptographic</b> <b>methods</b> leads to chance of key compromise and single point failure. To overcome this problem shared cryptography scheme becomes best solution.

A new environment is created by IoT devices because of having limited resources.

Although there is a vast range of IoT applications with different needs, ensuring security is a typical need of most of these applications. <b>Cryptographic</b> <b>methods</b> {{play a key role}} in ensuring security that encounter serious difficulties in IoT concept because they demand high computational power and memory.
