2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{complaints}} about Trudeau's infomercials is that he makes only vague references to scientific studies, making them impossible to cross-check for accuracy. The same criticism exists for the anecdotal evidence he presents in the infomercials. [...] He does not identify people who he claims have been cured by his methods. For example, he tells a story in an infomercial about [...] "a friend from England" [...] who came to his house and complained of heartburn. He also references a study done on the antidepressant qualities of St. John's Wort compared to two prescription medications. [...] These studies, the informercials suggest, are identified in the book being advertised for sale, but none of his books provide any such substantiation.

2500|$|In Season 5, {{four years}} after high school graduation, Lucas, now 22, suffers from writer's block and is under {{pressure}} from his editor/girlfriend Lindsey. He also tries to help Haley with her son, James Lucas Scott. When Peyton comes back home, she reveals to him that she did come to the signing, and then inspires him by repeating his quote: [...] "Your art matters". When he tells Peyton that the bartender she is flirting with at the Clothes Over Bros store opening {{is not good enough}} for her, it becomes obvious that, despite his relationship with Lindsey, he still loves Peyton.

When Peyton begins to antagonize Lindsey, he goes to confront her, but things escalate into a verbal fight about their break up. A little bit later, after Peyton confesses her feelings and kisses him, he kisses her back, passionately, but later proposes to Lindsey, leading Peyton to tell him that she will bury her feelings so that he can be happy. He then wins his first game as the Ravens coach, although the female counterparts miss it because they were locked in the library. He soon has to go to Dan's parole and speak up in order to have him stay locked up. He decides to have Nathan as his best man and then fuses his bachelor party with Lindsey's. He also gives Haley his new book, and she tells him not to marry Lindsey after reading it. Lucas proceeds with the wedding, but Lindsey stops him after realizing his book is about Peyton. She leaves him, and when he chases after her, he sees Lindsey's bags packed. After a confrontation, she leaves him, saying, [...] "People always leave, Luke. You know that." [...] (A reference to one of Peyton's famous lines, also featured in his first book.) Lucas flees to stay with his mother and Andy after the failed wedding. Andy convinces Lucas to go after Lindsey, prompting him to go to her and tell her that one day she will come back to him. She comes back to Tree Hill for Jamie's 5th birthday, but tells Lucas that it was really over. He then helps Brooke cope with having baby Angie around. After Lindsey calls him to tell him she is seeing someone, he blows up after an opposing player gets away with attempting to injure Quentin Fields, drawing himself a 10-game suspension. He becomes heavily drunk and tells Peyton he hates her when she comes to his help. He later apologizes to her after being confronted by Haley. He tells her that it was hard to let her go, hard to see her and that it remains difficult for him, making apparent his love for Peyton. Lindsey comes by to tell him his book is over and he <b>can</b> <b>e-mail</b> her the dedication. When he does, she reveals by phone that she still loves him.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The public {{computer}} network Internet is used intensively {{in research and}} scholarly communication. An important tool for the immediate exchange of research ideas and scholarly arguments is e-mail based discussion lists. E-mail messages sent to such a discussion list are distributed automatically to hundreds or even thousands of recipients worldwide. In this paper we discuss the role of e-mail based discussion lists in scholarly communication and analyze the structure {{and the development of}} CERRO-L, a Regional Economics oriented discussion list with focus on regional economic development in Central Europe. We will analyze the structure of subscribers and contributors to CERRO-L, and the content of their messages, the major topics, themes, and places (countries and regions) discussed. With this analysis {{we want to be able}} to answer questions like the following: "To what extent <b>can</b> <b>e-mail</b> discussion lists tie together research communities? " "How stable are such communities?" "Can e-mail discussion lists help overcome some of the limitations (spatial, cultural, language) of more traditional means of scholarly discussion? " "How focused are discussions on e-mail based discussion lists? " "What does electronic communication portend about scholarly exchanges and communities? " "What are the impacts of such communication on the formation, structure, and dissemination of knowledge itself?" 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to examine how response data from direct marketing email campaigns could be utilized in measuring the development of a customer relationship {{in the context of an}} end-user loyalty program. The case analysed in the study is Club Sony Ericsson e-mail campaigns targeted at its registered members. The primary research problem covered in the study is “how <b>can</b> <b>e-mail</b> direct marketing results be measured by using Club Sony Ericsson existing campaign response and customer data? ” In order to gain understanding of the role of e-mail direct marketing campaigns in a loyalty program, a framework is created around the concept of customer relationship. As a form of interactive marketing, e-mail direct marketing contributes to relationship development by providing a channel for dialogue that consists of both communication as well as interaction. The empirical study is conducted by using a quantitative research method. Data analysis is performed in ways that could also be applied in ongoing monitoring of relationship development within the case company. The study focus is on the information that click-through data can provide when combined with variables found from the customer database. The study is conducted based on individual level secondary data available on recent Club Sony Ericsson e-mail campaigns, collected from campaign report files and Club Sony Ericsson member database. Click-through activity was found to have positive correlation with all the other behavioral variables available o...|$|E
40|$|The Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) is a {{file format}} for {{describing}} interactive 3 D objects and worlds. VRML {{is designed to}} be used on the Internet, intranets, and local client systems. VRML is also intended to be a universal interchange format for integrated 3 D graphics and multimedia. VRML may be used in a variety of application areas such as engineering and scientific visualization, multimedia presentations, entertainment and educational titles, web pages, and shared virtual worlds. VRML is capable of representing static and animated dynamic 3 D and multimedia objects with hyperlinks to other media such as text, sounds, movies, and images. VRML browsers, as well as authoring tools for the creation of VRML files, are widely available for many different platforms. VRML supports an extensibility model that allows new dynamic 3 D objects to be defined allowing application communities to develop interoperable extensions to the base standard. There are mappings between VRML objects and commonly used 3 D application programmer interface (API) features. VRML is useful for a variety of applications, including data visualization, financial analysis, entertainment, education, distributed simulatio, computer-aided design, product marketing, virtual malls, user interfaces to information, scientific visualization. Data visualization turns numbers into a 3 D VRML world. It takes a complex database with lots of numerical information and turns it into a three-dimensional environment, which may have a time dimension. Even interactive features and sound can represent information. Financial analysis can use data visualization to visualize financial data, such as stock prices or corporate financial accounts. Anomalies and opportunities can be detected by highlighted areas in the data set. Entertainment is a potential goldmine for VRML developers, since VRML allows for interactive, 3 D movies. VRML allows customized, dynamically-generated camera angles with alternate scenarios possible. Education with VRML can give people a chance to learn something in a new way, or learn a real-life job without the dangers of physical machinery. Distributed Simulation can use multi-user VRML worlds over networks to simulate military exercises or industrial courses. Computer-Aided Design is an area where designers could collaborate on designing industrial parts or other 3 D objects in a shared multi-user space. Or alternatively, they <b>can</b> <b>e-mail</b> parts back and forth to each other, or put drafts up on Web servers for comments. Product Marketing often tries to reach buyers at an emotional level. VRML is great way to do this, for the same reasons that it will be successful in entertainment applications. In addition, marketers selling 3 -dimensional products like clothes can give buyers an impression of the object before they purchase it. As User Interfaces to Information, VRML can help bring some sense to the confusing hypermedia world of the Web, and to massive databases packed with more information than can be easily represented textually. In Scientific Visualization, researchers or students can observe a 3 D protein hovering in space and click on parts of it to learn about the function of the parts of the protein through hyperlinks to a database. In fact, Aereal Inc. is currently working on this for the Genetic Information Bank of Japan's Institute of Physical and Chemical Sciences...|$|E
