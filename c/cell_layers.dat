When {{the water in the}} digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some Anthozoa have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a hydrostatic skeleton, to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.|$|E
5|$|The skin colour of {{amphibians}} {{is produced}} by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores. These three <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, {{there is no direct}} control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.|$|E
40|$|Human spinal dura and arachnoid, {{obtained}} during neurosurgical operations, {{were studied}} by transmission electron microscopy. The ultrastructure of spinal meninges largely conformed to the morphology of the cranial meninges, but some minor differences were detected. The dura {{was composed of}} an outermost loosely arranged fibroelastic layer, a middle basically fibrous portion and an innermost cellular <b>layer</b> (dural border <b>cell</b> <b>layer).</b> The dural border <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> was characterised by multiple interdigitating cell processes, no extracellular collagen, significant extracellular spaces and few cell junctions. Paravascular vesiculated nerve profiles were encountered within the fibroadipose epidural tissue. The arachnoid was composed of an outermost portion (arachnoid barrier <b>cell</b> <b>layer),</b> presenting tightly packed cells, numerous tight junctions and no extracellular collagen. In view of its numerous tight junctions, the arachnoid barrier <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> is considered to represent an effective morphological and physiological meningeal barrier between the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space and the blood circulation in the dura. The arachnoid barrier layer was always characterised by a distinct continuous basal lamina on its inner surface towards the innermost collagenous portion of the arachnoid (arachnoid reticular <b>cell</b> <b>layer).</b> The interweaving arachnoid trabecular <b>cells</b> within this <b>layer</b> possessed numerous mitochondria and were anchored to the inner surface of the arachnoid barrier <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> by desmosomes. An additional layer of flattened branching cells was demonstrated along the inner surface of the arachnoid reticular <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> and assumed to be an "arachnoid border cell layer'. Morphological {{data suggest that the}} dura and arachnoid closely adhere at spinal levels in man without any naturally occurring "subdural space'.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 111 - 121) The {{contribution of}} the granule <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> to the generation of hippocampal slow waves (theta) has been controversial due to the technical difficulty of isolating the contribution of this layer {{from that of the}} pyramidal <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> in the hippocampus. Recently it has been observed that most of the granule <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> in the dentate of the rat hippocampus is mitotic postnatally while cells of the pyramidal <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> are born prenatally. Thus it is possible to lesion this layer with medium levels of radiation while leaving the pyramidal <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> intact. In this experiment hippocampal laminar profiles were performed on mature rats which had sustained granule cell lesion by radiation soon after birth. The most striking result was that, despite an 85 % cell reduction, theta activity in the dentate was more prominent than in controls. This was due to a loss of irregular fast activity in the dentate region. In addition, the phase advance seen in control animals during stimulated theta was absent in the irradiated animals. Finally, theta amplitude was decreased in the pyramidal <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> and increased in the granule <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> of the irradiated animals when compared to controls. These paradoxical results are discussed in terms of new evidence concerning granule cell plasticity following radiation...|$|R

25|$|Cell–cell {{adhesion}} complexes {{are essential}} {{for the formation of}} complex animal tissues. β-catenin is part of a protein complex that form the so-called adherens junctions. These cell-cell adhesion complexes are necessary for the creation and maintenance of epithelial <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> and barriers. As a component of the complex, β-catenin can regulate cell growth and adhesion between cells. It may also be responsible for transmitting the contact inhibition signal that causes cells to stop dividing once the epithelial sheet is complete. The E-cadherin – β-catenin – α-catenin complex is weakly associated to actin filaments. Adherent junctions thus form a dynamic, rather than a stable link to the actin cytoskeleton.|$|E
25|$|The {{mutations}} {{found in}} EEC are missense mutations, meaning {{that there is}} a single amino acid change in the protein, as opposed to premature termination of protein synthesis, known as a nonsense mutation. The frameshift mutation introduces a premature stop codon that affected the α isotope, but does not affect the β and γ isotopes of p63. From this, it can be concluded that mutant p63α isotopes seem {{to play a major role}} in the pathogenesis of EEC syndrome. Interestingly, it seems that p63α is the predominant p63 isotope in epithelial basal <b>cell</b> <b>layers,</b> which are the cell type often associated with the anomalies found in patients with EEC syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Papillomaviruses {{replicate}} {{exclusively in}} keratinocytes. Keratinocytes form the outermost {{layers of the}} skin, {{as well as some}} mucosal surfaces, such as the inside of the cheek or the walls of the vagina. These surface tissues, which are known as stratified squamous epithelia, are composed of stacked layers of flattened cells. The <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> are formed through a process known as cellular differentiation, in which keratinocytes gradually become specialized, eventually forming a hard, crosslinked surface that prevents moisture loss and acts as a barrier against pathogens. Less-differentiated keratinocyte stem cells, replenished on the surface layer, are thought to be the initial target of productive papillomavirus infections. Subsequent steps in the viral life cycle are strictly dependent on the process of keratinocyte differentiation. As a result, papillomaviruses can only replicate in body surface tissues.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} {{important}} layers {{in the dog}} and cat cornea. The outer layer is the epithelium, which is 25 to 40 micrometers and five to seven <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> thick. The epithelium holds the tear film in place and also prevents water from invading the cornea and disrupting the collagen fibers. This prevents corneal edema, which gives it a cloudy appearance. It is also a barrier to infectious agents. The epithelium sticks to the basement membrane, which also separates the epithelium from the stroma. The corneal stroma comprises 90 percent of {{the thickness of the}} cornea. It contains the collagen fibers organized into lamellae. The lamellae are in sheets which separate easily. Posterior to the stroma is Descemet's membrane, which is a basement membrane for the corneal endothelium. The endothelium is a single cell layer that separates the cornea from the aqueous humor.|$|E
25|$|Astrocytes are glial {{cells that}} are {{abundant}} in {{the central nervous system}}. They are crucial for the metabolic and trophic support of neurons; additionally, astrocytes provide ion buffering and neurotransmitter clearance. Growing axons are guided by cues created by astrocytes; thus, astrocytes can regulate neurite pathfinding and subsequently, patterning in the developing brain. The glial scar that forms post-injury in the central nervous system is formed by astrocytes and fibroblasts; it is the most significant obstacle for regeneration. The glial scar consists of hypertrophied astrocytes, connective tissue, and ECM. Two goals of neural tissue engineering are to understand astrocyte function and to develop control over astrocytic growth. Studies by Shany et al. (2006) have demonstrated that astrocyte survival rates are increased on 3D aragonite matrices compared to conventional 2D cell cultures. The ability of cell processes to stretch out across curves and pores allows for the formation of multiple <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> with complex 3D configurations.|$|E
25|$|Pinot Meunier, , {{also known}} as Meunier or Schwarzriesling, is a variety of black wine grape most noted for {{being one of the}} three main {{varieties}} used in the production of Champagne (the other two are the black variety Pinot noir and the white Chardonnay). Until recently, producers in Champagne generally did not acknowledge Pinot Meunier, preferring to emphasise the use of the other noble varieties, but now Pinot Meunier is gaining recognition for the body and richness it contributes to Champagne. Pinot Meunier is approximately one-third of all the grapes planted in Champagne. It is a chimeric mutation of Pinot: its inner <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> are composed of a Pinot genotype which is close to Pinot noir or Pinot gris; the outer, epidermal, layer is however made up of a mutant, distinctive, genotype.

40|$|Generating {{autologous}} tissue grafts of a clinically {{useful volume}} requires efficient and controlled expansion of cell populations harvested from patients. Hollow fibre bioreactors show promise as cell expansion devices, owing to {{their potential for}} scale-up. However, further research is required to establish how to specify appropriate hollow fibre bioreactor operating conditions for expanding different cell types. In this study we develop a simple model {{for the growth of}} a <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> seeded on the outer surface of a single fibre in a perfused hollow fibre bioreactor. Nutrient-rich culture medium is pumped through the fibre lumen and leaves the bioreactor via the lumen outlet or passes through the porous fibre walls and <b>cell</b> <b>layer,</b> and out via ports on the outer wall of the extra-capillary space. Stokes and Darcy equations for fluid flow in the fibre lumen, fibre wall, <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> and extra-capillary space are coupled to reaction-advection-diffusion equations for oxygen and lactate transport through the bioreactor, and to a simple growth law for the evolution of the free boundary of the <b>cell</b> <b>layer.</b> <b>Cells</b> at the free boundary are assumed to proliferate at a rate that increases with the local oxygen concentration, and to die and detach from the layer if the local fluid shear stress or lactate concentration exceed critical thresholds. We use the model to predict operating conditions that maximise the <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> growth for different cell types. In particular, we predict the optimal flow rate of culture medium into the fibre lumen and fluid pressure imposed at the lumen outlet for cell types with different oxygen demands and fluid shear stress tolerances, and compare the growth of the <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> when the exit ports {{on the outside of the}} bioreactor are open with that when they are closed. Model simulations reveal that increasing the inlet flow rate and outlet fluid pressure increases oxygen delivery to the <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> and, therefore, the growth rate of cells that are tolerant to high shear stresses, but may be detrimental for shear-sensitive <b>cells.</b> The <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> growth rate is predicted to increase, and be less sensitive to the lactate tolerance of the cells, when the exit ports are opened, as the radial flow through the bioreactor is enhanced and the lactate produced by the cells cleared more rapidly from the <b>cell</b> <b>layer...</b>|$|R

25|$|Anthocyanins are {{phenolic}} compounds {{found throughout the}} plant kingdom, being frequently responsible for the blue to red colors found in flowers, fruits and leaves. In wine grapes, they develop during the stage of veraison when the skin of red wine grapes changes color from green to red to black. As the sugars in the grape increase during ripening so does the concentration of anthocyanins. In most grapes anthocyanins are found only in the outer <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> of the skin, leaving the grape juice inside virtually colorless. Therefore, to get color pigmentation in the wine, the fermenting must {{needs to be in}} contact with the grape skins in order for the anthocyanins to be extracted. Hence, white wine can be made from red wine grapes {{in the same way that}} many white sparkling wines are made from the red wine grapes of Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier. The exception to this is the small class of grapes known as teinturiers, such as Alicante Bouschet, which have a small amount of anthocyanins in the pulp that produces pigmented juice.|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens overwinters in infested soils. Agrobacterium species live {{predominantly}} saprophytic lifestyles, so it's {{not uncommon}} even for plant parasitic species of this genus {{to survive in}} the soil for lengthy periods of time, even without host plant presence. When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to cell transformation. Agrobacterium performs this control by inserting the plasmid T-DNA in the plant's genome. More details about this process of plasmid DNA insertion are mentioned in the preceding sections. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads to gall formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes it to become crushed and/or distorted, ultimately leading to reduced water flow in the xylem due to crushed vessels. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to secondary invasion by insects and saprophytic microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes breakdown of the peripheral <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant.|$|E
25|$|Dark skin offers great {{protection}} against UVR {{because of its}} eumelanin content, the UVR-absorbing capabilities of large melanosomes, and because eumelanin can be mobilized faster and brought {{to the surface of}} the skin from the depths of the epidermis. For the same body region, light- and dark-skinned individuals have similar numbers of melanocytes (there is considerable variation between different body regions), but pigment-containing organelles, called melanosomes, are larger and more numerous in dark-skinned individuals. Keratocytes from dark skin cocultured with melanocytes give rise to a melanosome distribution pattern characteristic of dark skin. Melanosomes are not in aggregated state in darkly pigmented skin compared to lightly pigmented skin. Due to the heavily melanised melanosomes in darkly pigmented skin, it can absorb more energy from UVR and thus offers better {{protection against}} sunburns and by absorption and dispersion UV rays. Darkly pigmented skin protects against direct and indirect DNA damage. Photodegration occurs when melanin absorbs photons. Recent research suggest that the photoprotective effect of dark skin is increased by the fact that melanin can capture free radicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, which are created by the interaction of UVR and layers of the skin. Heavily pigmented melanocytes have greater capacity to divide after UVR irradiation, which suggests that they receive less damage to their DNA. Despite this, UVB damages the immune system even in darker skinned individuals due to its effect on Langerhans cells. The stratum corneum of people with dark or heavily tanned skin is more condensed and contains more cornified <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> than in lightly pigmented humans. These qualities of dark skin enhance the barrier protection function of the skin.|$|E
