This doubling of the original prism increases the angular dispersion of the assembly, and also has the useful property that the centre wavelength is refracted back into the direct line of the entrance beam. The exiting ray of the <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> is thus not only undeviated from the incident ray, but also experiences no translation (i.e. transverse displacement or offset) away from the incident ray's path.|$|E

The difference-frequency control is achieved with an intracavity etalon. Changing the finesse of the etalon enables the adjustment of the pulse duration between 6 and 35 ps. The emitted two-color pulses are modulated by a beat frequency in the terahertz range. Self-starting mode-locking with 0. 8 -W average output power is demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|The phase {{matching}} angle {{makes possible}} any gain at all (0th order). In a collinear setup, {{the freedom to}} choose the <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> allows a constant gain up to first order in wavelength. Noncollinear OPAs were developed to have an additional degree of freedom, allowing constant gain up to second order in wavelength. The optimal parameters are 4 degrees of noncollinearity, β-barium borate (BBO) as the material, a 400-nm pump wavelength, and signal around 800 nm. This generates a bandwidth 3 times as large of that of a Ti-sapphire-amplifier. The first order is mathematically equivalent to some properties of the group velocities involved, but {{this does not mean that}} pump and signal have the same group velocity. After propagation through 1-mm BBO, a short pump pulse no longer overlaps with the signal. Therefore, chirped pulse amplification must be used in situations requiring large gain amplification in long crystals. Long crystals introduce such a large chirp that a compressor is needed anyway. An extreme chirp can lengthen a 20-fs seed pulse to 50 ps, making it suitable for use as the pump. Unchirped 50-ps pulses with high energy can be generated from rare earth-based lasers.|$|E
50|$|Since CARS {{is such a}} {{nonlinear}} process {{there are}} not really any 'typical' experimental numbers. One example is given below under the explicit warning that just changing the pulse duration by one order of magnitude changes the CARS signal by three orders of magnitude. The comparison should only {{be used as an}} indication of the order of magnitude of the signals. 200 mW average power input (CW for the Raman), in a 0.9NA objective with a <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> around 800 nm, constitutes a power density of 26 MW/cm,2 (focus length = 1.5 micrometre, focus volume = 1.16 micrometre3, photon energy = 2.31×10−19 J or 1.44 eV). The Raman cross section for the vibration of the aromatic ring in Toluene around 1000 cm−1 is on the order of 10−29cm2/molecule·steradian. Therefore, the Raman signal is around 26×10−23 W/molecule·steradian or 3.3×10−21 W/molecule (over 4π steradians). That is 0.014 photon/sec·molecule. The density of Toluene = 0.8668×103 kg/m3, Molecular mass = 92.14×10−3 kg/mol. Therefore, the focal volume (~1 cubic micrometre) contains 6×109 molecules. Those molecules together generate a Raman signal in the order of 2×10−11 W (20 pW) or roughly one hundred million photons/sec (over 4π steradians). A CARS experiment with similar parameters (150 mW at 1064 nm, 200 mW at 803.5 nm, 15ps pulses at 80 MHz repetition frequency, same objective lens) yields roughly 17.5×10−6 W (on the 3000 cm−1 line, which has 1/3 of the strength and roughly 3 times the width). This CARS power is roughly 106 higher than the Raman but since there are 6×109 molecules, the signal per molecule from CARS is only 4×10−25 W/molecule·s or 1.7×10−6 photons/molecule·s. If we allow two factors of three (line strength and line width) then the spontaneous Raman signal per molecule still exceeds the CARS per molecule by more than two orders of magnitude. The coherent addition of the CARS signal from the molecules however yields a total signal that is much higher than the Raman.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> {{accuracy}} of a Fiber Bragg Grating Sensor {{system that has}} {{a large number of}} sensor elements both as a function of wavelength and as a function of position. Determining the <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> of each of the fiber optic sensors is a critical parameter that ultimately determines sensor accuracy. The high density environment can result in degradation of accuracy of the <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> measurement. This thesis aims to quantify this measurement error both with theoretical and experimental studies. There are many sensing applications where optical fiber sensors are preferred over electrical sensors, such as {{the oil and gas industry}} where fiber optic sensors are used to monitor wells and pipelines due to their low signal degradation over long distances and immunity to harsh physical environments. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors in particular have widespread use because of their versatility, measurement sensitivity, and distributed multiplexing abilities. In conventional wavelength multiplexing, up to 50 FBG sensors are spread out over a band of 100 nm, each with a <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> difference large enough so that each element can be individually measured. However, numerous sensing applications require several hundred to over a thousand sensors cascaded together on a single fiber. These sensor arrays use a combination of WDM and TDM for measurements, where many FBG sensors with the same <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> are separated by a long enough length of fiber so that the reflected signals are separated in time. These Wavelength-to-Time Domain Multiplexing (W-TDM) measurements are enabled by Insight Photonic’s new ‘akinetically’ swept, all-semiconductor laser. This laser is a Vernier-Tuned Distributed Bragg Reflector (VT-DBR) device, capable of rapidly sweeping through different wavelengths without any moving parts. Attributes that make this laser superior to mechanically-swept lasers include: 1) short and long term consistent sweep-sweep reliability, 2) availability at many wavelengths, 3) a narrow linewidth with single longitudinal mode, and 4) the ability to do non-traditional sweep patterns that facilitate measurement of high-density sensor networks. In this thesis, experiments will be performed in the lab with the Insight VT-DBR laser to determine how accurately the <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> of a single Fiber Bragg grating can be measured. Experiments will also be performed with two and three FBGs to compare different algorithmic approaches to measurements. The second part of the thesis will simulate both single and multiple FBG sensor environments, comparing the <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> measurement accuracy results for different parameters including signal-to-noise ratios, wavelength point density, FBG loss and width, and multiple algorithmic approaches. The results of these experiments and simulations will demonstrate how accurate a FBG sensor system is at particular parameters, which will be useful to those designing a sensor network or performing similar experiments...|$|E

Since the diffraction efficiency strongly depends on the beam quality, the multiplexing efficiency decreases to 94 % (M 2 = 25) and 85 %± 3 % (M 2 = 45) if multimode radiation is overlaid. Besides, the calculated multiplexing efficiency of the radiation with M 2 = 45 amounts to 87 : 5 %. Thus, calculations and measurements are in good agreement.
