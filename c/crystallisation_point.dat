30|$|On {{the cooling}} curves, without any {{homogenisation}} pressure, the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>point</b> of GTCC declined from − 44.34 (100 % GTCC) to − 49.9 °C (75 % GTCC). When {{the concentration of}} GTCC decreased to 50 %, the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>point</b> decreased to below − 60 °C, the possible reason being that CoQ 10 molecule entered into the structure of GTCC and disturbed the ordered structure of GTCC [41]. When the concentration of CoQ 10 increased to 25 %, one broadened crystallisation peak at about − 35 °C was present on the cooling curves, possibly representing the co-melting complex of GTCC/CoQ 10. When the concentration of CoQ 10 increased to 50 %, one narrow crystallisation peak (− 30.89 °C) and two weak crystallisation peaks (− 22.75 and − 10.08 °C) were present. When the concentration of CoQ 10 increased to 75 %, one relatively narrow crystallisation peak (− 31.21 °C) and one broadened strong peak (− 9.28 °C) was shown on the cooling curves. Compared to pure CoQ 10 (0 % GTCC), the depression of the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>point</b> of CoQ 10 {{may be explained by}} the GTCC molecule entering into the structure of CoQ 10 resulted in less ordered crystal structure of CoQ 10 during the cooling process [10], delaying the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>point.</b> However, after high-pressure homogenisation (above 300 bar), the crystallisation peaks of CoQ 10 and of the co-melting complex of GTCC/CoQ 10 were absent, indicating a supercooled state due to the effect of nanosize particles. From the above result, the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>point</b> of CoQ 10 -LNCs depended mainly {{on the size of the}} particles; when the size reached down to about 200 nm, no crystallisation of CoQ 10 was present, indicating supercooled state. Supercooled nanoparticles were potentially more stable with respect to nanoparticles recrystallisation over other types of lipid nanoparticles like fat emulsions and solid lipid nanoparticles [42].|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the project}} is to develop {{long-term}} energy storage equipment for house heating using absorption. Solar energy is stored in summer through desorption and heat is released in winter through absorption. The originality of this concept is to allow the solution to reach the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>point,</b> which is usually avoided in the absorption refrigeration machines. The potential energy densities of five absorption couples, LiBr-H 2 O, LiCl-H 2 O, CaCl 2 -H 2 O, NaOH-H 2 O and NH 3 -H 2 O, have been studied for this project. The storage capacity increases with the concentration after desorption and {{the temperature of the}} evaporator and decreases with the temperature of the absorber. The temperature requirement for the solar energy is lower than 135 °C with those couples...|$|E
40|$|Morphology and {{rheology}} of the blends of two commercial polypropylene (PP) grades (designated as MA 3 and MM 1) with {{a commercial}} modifier (EP 1) based on hydrogenated oligo (cyclopentadiene) (HOCP) were studied using modulated {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (MDSC) and dynamic shear rheometry. Melting and <b>crystallisation</b> <b>points</b> as well as glass-transition temperatures were determined and correlated to blends&# 039; compositions. Morphology was additionally studied by hot-stage optical microscopy (HSOM). Molecular characteristics of the materials were determined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). Dynamic (oscillatory) shear tests were conducted at different temperatures (190, 210, 230 and 250 °C) in a wide frequency range (0. 01 - 300 rad/s) and rheological parameters (such as zero-shear viscosity, activation energy) were also correlated to {{the composition of the}} blends. Thermal behaviour of both series of blends suggests phase separation at modifier concentrations above 30 %. Dynamic viscosity of MA 3 /EP 1 blends decreased with increasing EP 1 concentration, while the rheological behaviour of MM 1 /EP 1 system was more complex, due to changing the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of PP component...|$|R
50|$|Planning {{for a third}} runway (called Startbahn 18 West) {{began in}} 1973. This project spawned massive protests by {{residents}} and environmentalists. The main points of conflict were increasing noise and pollution and the cutting down of protected trees in the Frankfurt City Forest. While the protests and related lawsuits were unsuccessful in preventing {{the construction of the}} runway, the Startbahn West protests were one of the major <b>crystallisation</b> <b>points</b> for the German environmental movement of the 1980s. The protests even continued after the runway had been opened in 1984 and in 1987 two police officers were killed by a gunman. This incident ended the Startbahn West protests for good. Because of its orientation in the north-south direction, in contrast to the other two runways which run east-west, the use of the third runway is limited. The Startbahn West can only be used for takeoffs to the south because otherwise they would interfere with air traffic at the other runways. Due to this restriction the runway must be partially or fully closed when northward winds are too strong.|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{international}} law is traditionally seen as a dialogue with either general legal history or positive international law. From the first paradigm stems a predilection {{for the history of}} doctrine. The second strand explains a continuous quest for the intellectual pedigree of contemporary paradigms. Consequently, literature extensively covers treatises and (published) treaties. Yet, if the formation and expression {{of international law}} is determined by state practice, a study limited to those traditional sources can only cover the evenemential surface of state behaviour at formal <b>crystallisation</b> <b>points.</b> My study on two cases in European diplomacy (the decades after the Peace of Utrecht (1713) and de Gaulle’s contestation of the Cold War order) put legal argumentative practices at its core. Neighbouring disciplines, such as the New Diplomatic History, Cultural Constitutional History or sociology, provide fruitful theoretical insights to enhance our understanding of practical legal argumentation. Turning from treaty collections and 'big names' to dispatches drafted by ambassadors and politicians, or to legal memoranda elaborated in the foreign office administrations, legal history can go beyond its traditional narrative and enhance our understanding of the process of international law...|$|R
30|$|Surfactant-free CoQ 10 -LNCs, {{composed}} of lecithin, CoQ 10 and GTCC, were successfully prepared by high-pressure homogenisation. Particle size {{was the primary}} influencing factor on the CI of CoQ 10, while the ratio of CoQ 10 /GTCC was the key factor affecting the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>point</b> of CoQ 10. When the particle size of CoQ 10 -LNCs reached about 400 nm, the CI of CoQ 10 was reduced to less than 3 %; when the size further decreased to about 200 nm, no enthalpy was present. From the cooling process, the supercooled state of CoQ 10 was maintained even at a lower temperature (− 40 °C). The lecithin monolayer structure of CoQ 10 -LNCs was investigated via the Cryo-TEM method. CoQ 10 -LNCs structured with a lecithin monolayer sphere have been investigated to be a suitable delivery system for both epidermal targeting and superficial dermal targeting; moreover, the degree of distribution depended on the ratio of CoQ 10 /GTCC.|$|E
40|$|During the melt-extrusion of blends of {{aliphatic}} polyamide 46 (PA 46) and {{aromatic polyamide}} 61 (PA 61), transamidation reactions occur between the blend components. This yields polyamide copolymers consisting of crystallisable PA 46 and noncrystallisable PA 61 sequences. The {{effect of the}} copolymer formation on the semicrystalline morphology is studied by time-resolved SAXS and WAXS measurements using synchrotron radiation and by transmission electron microscopy. From WAXS patterns it is noticed that only an excess of PA 61 in the blends affects the PA 46 crystal unit cell at room temperature by hindering or inhibiting the Brill-transition during cooling from the melt. Close to the melting or <b>crystallisation</b> <b>point,</b> the PA 46 crystal structure is independent of the blend composition or thermal history. Consequently, the observed melting point depression cannot be ascribed to less perfect PA 46 crystals, but to a smaller lamellar thickness of the crystallised PA 46 sequences which is confirmed by TEM.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of the inner lipid ratio on the physicochemical properties and skin targeting of surfactant-free lecithin-based coenzyme Q 10 -loaded lipid nanocapsules (CoQ 10 -LNCs). The smaller particle size of CoQ 10 -LNCs was achieved by high pressure and a lower ratio of CoQ 10 /GTCC (Caprylic/capric triglyceride); however, the zeta potential of CoQ 10 -LNCs was above /− 60 mV/ with no distinct difference among them at different ratios of CoQ 10 /GTCC. Both the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>point</b> and the index decreased with the decreasing ratio of CoQ 10 /GTCC and smaller particle size; interestingly, the supercooled state of CoQ 10 -LNCs was observed at particle size below about 200 nm, as verified by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in one heating–cooling cycle. The lecithin monolayer sphere structure of CoQ 10 -LNCs was investigated by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM). The skin penetration results revealed that the distribution of Nile red-loaded CoQ 10 -LNCs depended on the ratio of inner CoQ 10 /GTCC; moreover, epidermal targeting and superficial dermal targeting were achieved by the CoQ 10 -LNCs application. The highest fluorescence response was observed at a ratio of inner CoQ 10 /GTCC of 1 : 1. These observations suggest that lecithin-based LNCs could be used as a promising topical delivery vehicle for lipophilic compounds.|$|E

These materials are of great research interest as present biological effect. For {{the achievement of the}} above aim our study was focused on the physicochemical properties of the materials. Firstly, by the thermal analysis method polymorphism and rotation phase has been oserved, as well as, melting and <b>crystallisation</b> <b>points</b> and the corresponding heats of trasitions were calculated. In order to interpretate the results other derivatives of α-aminoacids has been studied, as well as, hexadecaminoacid, hexadecalcohol and hexadecamine. As the liquid crystalline structure and the supercooling effect of the 2 -aminoalcohols, has been oserved the optical microscopy method was used to support the above results. Raman spectroscopy was used {{for the study of the}} structure and the morphology of the materials (both low and high frequencies). For the theoretical calculations of LAM- 1 vibrations the linear Zerbi model was modified. Raman spectra were taken at the temperatures were phase transitions were observed by thermal analysis. Also, the rotation phase has been studied spectroscopically. The results had lead us to introduce a model where the molecular mobility of the carbon chains is described. The molecular mobility is also studied by dielectric spectroscopy. Finally, by using the X-ray diffraction technique the d-spacings of the materials have been determined, which helped for the interpretation of the observed polymorphism. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{presently}} favoured {{concept for}} the early evolution of the Moon involves consolidation of debris from a giant impact of a Mars sized body with Earth forming a primitive Moon with a thick global layer of melt {{referred to as the}} Lunar Magma Ocean 1. It is widely accepted that many significant features observed on the Moon today are the result of crystallisation of this magma ocean. However, controversy exists over the precise timing and duration of the crystallisation process. Resolution of this problem depends on the establishment of precise and robust key <b>crystallisation</b> time <b>points.</b> We report a 4417 6 Myr old zircon in lunar breccia sample 72215, 195, which provides a precisely determined younger limit for the solidification of the Lunar Magma Ocean. A model based on these data, together with the age of the Moon forming giant impact, defines an exponential time frame for crystallisation and suggests formation of anorthositic crust after about 80 - 85 % of the magma ocean was solidified. In combination with other zircon ages the 4417 +/- 6 Myr age also suggests that the very small (less than a few per cent) residual portion of the magma ocean continued to solidify during the following 300 - 500 m. y...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} several cryoextenders previously used by several authors and various freezing protocols {{to determine the}} relative importance of each parameter on sperm freezing. The effects of controlled seeding and changes in cooling rate at different stages of freezing were also examined. Sperm samples from seven individual carp males were frozen in 0. 5 ml straws by conventional freezing. Cooling rates were determined by monitoring the sample's internal temperature. We compared four freezing protocols, which involved placing sperm samples at various levels (1, 3, 6, and 9 cm) above the liquid nitrogen (LN) surface (corresponding to - 190, - 150, - 110, and - 70 °C, respectively) for 20 min followed by transferring the samples into LN. Freezing at 3 cm above the LN surface resulted in the highest motility (33 ? 8 %) and velocity (118 ? 9 ?m/s) of spermatozoa after thawing and diluting in swimming medium. We determined that - 90 °C is an optimal temperature at which immersing the samples in LN does not affect sperm motility after thawing. The sperm motility of samples immersed in LN before or immediately after the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>point</b> (- 16 °C) was 0 %. Motility of spermatozoa cryopreserved with or without a seeding procedure was not significantly different after thawing. Therefore, we hypothesise that supercooling the sample during the conventional freezing procedure is not the main damaging factor during carp spermatozoa cryopreservation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{electric}} resistivity of {{the iron}} and boron based (Fe 80 Si 6 B 14, Fe 76 : 2 Ni 3 : 8 Si 6 B 14, Fe 78 : 5 Ni 1 Mo 0 : 5 Si 6 B 14) metallic glasses (MGs) was investigated in the temperature range 300 ^ 900 K under an argon atmosphere by the four-probe method. The heating rate was varied from 2 Kmin � 1 up to 11 K min � 1. The character of the temperature dependence of resistivity, r(T), for all samples under study {{within the range of}} the stability of amorphous structure was found to be linear, which is typical for a transition metal ^ metalloid MG. The form of r changed when MGs doped with nickel and molybdenum were analysed within the frame of the modified Ziman model. A change in the r(T) curves was observed at T> 700 K because of the structural transformation to a crystalline state. In the precrystallisation temperature range, r changed nonlinearly, presumably because of structural relaxation of the MGs. The character of r changes at the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>point,</b> thus demonstrating the mechanism of primary crystallisation. The crystallisation kinetics were studied by the Kissinger method. The values of activation energy, E a, are in good agreement with those obtained from isothermal measurements and the Avrami equation (E a ˆ 325 and 300 kJ mol � 1, respectively, for Fe 80 Si 6 B 14). In addition, the value of Ea exhibited a tendency to rise when the MGs were doped with an additional component. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. This study {{involves}} the fractionation and characterisation of three propyleneethylene random copolymers. The fractionation technique {{used in the}} study was temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF). The TREF fractions were subsequently analysed offline by crystallisation analysis fractionation (CRYSTAF), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 13 C NMR, high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography (HT-GPC), and wide-angle x-ray diffraction (WAXD). The effect of the ethylene comonomer on the crystallisability of the propylene was investigated, along with the effect of the comonomer on the type of crystal phase formed during the crystallisation. The results show that the comonomer inhibits the crystallisation of the copolymer and that as the ethylene content increases, the <b>crystallisation</b> and melting <b>points</b> decrease. It was also shown that the higher the ethylene content, the more of the γ-phase crystal type is formed. The distribution of the comonomer throughout the copolymers was also investigated. The results show that there is an uneven distribution of the comonomer with most of the comonomer accumulating in the amorphous areas, and very little actually being incorporated in the crystalline regions. It was also observed that the fractions eluting at the highest temperatures had considerably higher polydispersities and lower molecular weights than the fractions eluting just before them. The highest temperature fractions also have lower melting and crystallisation temperatures than the preceding fractions. This has been attributed to a nucleation effect by the sand support used during the TREF fractionation...|$|R

(2010 : 88); Etzkowitz and Ranga (2011 : 141 – 142); Ranga and Etzkowitz (2010 : 8); Todeva and Etzkowitz (2013 : 11)) {{discusses}} {{the role of}} intermediation in triple helix research only indirectly and rather at the periphery when he describes, as the third stage {{of the emergence of}} the triple helix, the ‘[c]reation of a new overlay of trilateral networks and organizations from the interaction among the three helices [and that] [s]uch groups typically form to fill gaps in an innovation system by “brainstorming” new ideas’ (2003 a: 301). Similarly, Ranga and Etzkowitz (2013 : 250) mention, in passing, ‘intermediary and transfer organizations and networks—[forming] the innovation space—that are the breeding ground of new knowledge-based clusters.’ It appears that the organisations, groups and networks which Etzkowitz (2002, 2003 a, b) and Ranga and Etzkowitz (2013) have in mind as being interstitial and intermediary—in that they are ‘(intentionally) situated between the state, industry, and higher education’ (Metcalfe 2010 : 507)—will, at some <b>crystallisation</b> <b>point</b> of inter-helical relational saturation, spontaneously and organically ‘spring into existence’ for purposes of developing and promoting the cognitive, spatial, organisational and social innovation proximity (Bellgardt et al. 2014; Cantù et al. 2015; D’Este et al. 2012; Villani et al. 2016; Zhou 2014) required among the three stakeholder-helices. Accordingly, these organisations, groups and networks come to constitute the core ‘agents whose task is to combine the industry-university-government structure together, thereby supporting the development of Triple Helix structures’ (Suvinen et al. 2010 : 1367). Notwithstanding such critical agency role (and its attendant agency and social cost dilemmas), almost none of the current triple helix/innovation/knowledge intermediation literature appears to focus on the legal and regulatory details of designing and institutionalising efficient decision-making and governance equilibria in real-world triple helix intermediation projects. As Garrett-Jones et al. (2013 : 80) have pointed out, the triple helix model, among other innovation models, is ‘limited because [it] fail[s] to explain how the new cross-sector R&D organisations are best structured, managed and sustained and how the process of renegotiation takes place between the [collaborative] centres and the member institutions’—in particular, if one also assumes that asset specificity (Williamson 1975) applies to the production of triple helix innovation gains and that long-term triple helix innovation is characterised by a continual (and to be intermediated) struggle over, thus, costly renegotiation of, the allocation and distribution of team-produced innovation gains.|$|E
