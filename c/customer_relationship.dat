Reicheld broadened the concept to include loyalty from employees, suppliers, distributors and shareholders.

25|$|When {{the vendor}} {{is aware of}} the {{customer}} request it will determine the customer needs. By checking what the customer current configuration is and what the customer desires. This process can also take place automatically by checking the customer configuration in the configuration management system. More information on this system is provided in the next chapter. When it is clear what product the customer needs and the possible modifications to this product it is necessary to determine if the customer current configuration suits the new product. The current configuration is compared to the constraints of the new product. This can also be done automatically by the configuration management system. When the configuration of the customer appears to be insufficient the customer is informed about this. For example the vendor can make clear to the customer that it will need an external product for this new product to run properly. Besides this the <b>Customer</b> <b>Relationship</b> Management (CRM) system of the vendor is updated. There is more information about this in the chapter about CRM.|$|E
25|$|A sales assistant's role {{typically}} includes greeting customers, providing {{product and}} service-related information, providing advice about products available from current stock, answering customer questions, finalising customer transactions and if necessary, providing follow-up service {{necessary to ensure}} customer satisfaction. For retail store owners, it is extremely important to train personnel with the requisite skills necessary to deliver excellent customer service. Such skills may include product knowledge, inventory management, handling cash and credit transactions, handling product exchange and returns, dealing with difficult customers and of course, a detailed knowledge of store policies. The provision of excellent customer service creates more opportunities to build enduring customer relationships {{with the potential to}} turn customers into sources of referral or retail advocates. In the long term, excellent customer service provides businesses with an ongoing reputation and may lead to a competitive advantage. Customer service is essential for several reasons. Firstly, customer service contributes to the customer's overall retail experience. Secondly, evidence suggests that a retail organization which trains its employees in appropriate customer service benefits more than those who do not. Customer service training entails instructing personnel in the methods of servicing the customer that will benefit corporations and businesses. It is important to establish a bond amongst customers-employees known as <b>Customer</b> <b>relationship</b> management.|$|E

ES has a module in its CRM software that contains all contracts of each customer. This is linked to their PDM system. Every contract corresponds to files that can be downloaded for a new version or update of a previous version. In the delivery phase this means that the customers are able to obtain all the products through an online connection. So ES sells contracts (licenses) and stores them into their CRM system, the delivery of the actual products can be done by the customers themselves completely automated requiring little effort. The PDM system is on its turn linked to the SCM system which keeps track of the configurations the customers are using. In the delivery phase this means that ES is able to automatically determine the customer needs whenever a customer does a request.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – A {{trade-off}} {{exists between}} product variety and supply chain (SC) performance. To help mitigate {{the impact on}} SC of increased product variety, this paper examines how variety-management activities including variety management strategy, supplier partnerships and close <b>customer</b> <b>relationships</b> affect SC flexibility and agility {{at different levels of}} customisation. Design/methodology/approach – A survey-research methodology is employed using data from 363 manufacturing firms from the UK and South Korea. In particular, cluster analysis and structural equation modelling were used to evaluate the proposed model according to the level of customisation. Findings – The results suggest that internal variety-management strategy and external SC integration have a positive influence on SC flexibility and agility. <b>Customer</b> <b>relationships</b> and variety-management strategies influence SC flexibility more than partnerships with suppliers whereas variety-management strategies and partnerships with suppliers influence SC agility more than <b>customer</b> <b>relationships.</b> In fact, for external integration in particular, <b>customer</b> <b>relationships</b> influence SC flexibility (i. e., reaction capability) rather than agility (i. e., reaction time) whereas partnerships with suppliers influence SC agility rather than flexibility. In a high-customisation context, close <b>customer</b> <b>relationships</b> are {{the most effective way to}} increase SC flexibility, whereas partnerships with suppliers are the most effective way to increase SC agility. In a low-customisation context, a variety management strategy and <b>customer</b> <b>relationships</b> are the most effective way to increase both SC flexibility and agility. Originality/Value – This paper suggests key variety management activities to aid managers to better manage product-variety ambitions in SC under varying customisation profiles through internal and external approaches...|$|R

The study draws upon a variety of {{research}} streams including Supply Chain Management, Industrial Marketing, and the literature on factors that affect firm growth. The objectives of the study are to: identify relationship management activities employed by SMMs and investigate the links between relationship management activities, critical dimensions of <b>customer</b> <b>relationships</b> and growth potential To this end, a series of semi-structured interviews with a set of SMMs and a large-scale mail survey of SMMs are conducted. Data collected through the mail survey are analysed using a variety of statistical techniques including factor analysis, multiple regression analysis and cluster analysis. Study findings indicate that SMMs who are problem- solvers and increase their own share of value added in the supply chain can develop stronger <b>customer</b> <b>relationships.</b> SMMs can influence the strength of <b>customer</b> <b>relationships</b> {{to a greater extent than}} the fairness of <b>customer</b> <b>relationships.</b> The study proposes a relationship-oriented typology of SMMs based on how they define their business and how they shape their customer base.

CRM has, during the last few years, become one of the most discussed subjects in the field of IT. However, there is an overconfidence on CRM-systems and that companies become better on handling and creating better <b>customer</b> <b>relationships</b> when implementing and using such a system. From this standpoint it’s important that companies understand the true meaning of CRM and it’s implications on the development of <b>customer</b> <b>relationships.</b> The essay is thus based on the following question: What significance does a CRM-system have on companies’ development of <b>customer</b> <b>relationships?</b>     Purpose: The purpose is to describe and analyze the {{significance of}} CRMsystems in companies’ development of <b>customer</b> <b>relationships.</b> Theory: The theoretical reasoning starts with describing and defining the term relationship, as relationships is a vital part in the relationship marketing. It continues with describing the implications of the term relationship marketing to offer a background and an understanding of the foundations of CRM and it’s purpose. Finally the terms CRM and CRM-systems are described to ascertain the significance of a CRM-system {{in the development of}} <b>customer</b> <b>relationships.</b> Method: The essay is based on a deductive approach and the structure of the essay is 90 % theory and 10 % empirics where the empirical material functions as a practical feature to the theoretical reasoning. The empirical investigation is of a qualitative nature and has been carried out on ABB.   Findings: CRM-systems probably have a relatively small significance in the development of <b>customer</b> <b>relationships.</b> What’s important is that companies have an all-embracing relationship philosophy within their organization with developed CRM-strategies. Considering this, CRM-systems can still be of much use in the handling of data and information in the specific customer relation.
