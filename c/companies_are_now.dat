25|$|Photoelectron {{spectroscopy}} {{is usually}} {{done in a}} high-vacuum environment, since the electrons would be scattered by gas molecules if they were present. However, some <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> selling products that allow photoemission in air. The light source can be a laser, a discharge tube, or a synchrotron radiation source.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> making lightweight, {{portable}} speaker systems for small venues that route the low-frequency {{parts of the}} music (electric bass, bass drum, etc.) to a powered subwoofer. Routing the low-frequency energy to a separate amplifier and subwoofer can substantially improve the bass-response of the system. Also, clarity may be enhanced, because low-frequency sounds take {{a great deal of}} power to amplify; with only a single amplifier for the entire sound spectrum, the power-hungry low-frequency sounds can take a disproportionate amount of the sound system's power.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution {{was further}} amended in 2002, {{allowing}} a transfer or proposed transfer of reserves between statutory boards upon {{the passing of}} a resolution by the statutory board to add those reserves to its past reserves. Finally, following amendments in 2004, statutory boards and Government <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> allowed to transfer their surpluses either to the Government or to each other without the President's scrutiny. A new Article 148I was also added, enabling the Government to transfer its past reserves to any statutory boards and Government companies without the President's consent.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of private hospitals are {{in urban areas}} and, unlike many of the public hospitals, are equipped with the latest diagnostic and imaging facilities. Private hospitals have not generally been seen as an ideal investment—it has often taken up to ten years before companies have seen any profits. However, the situation has now changed and <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> exploring this area again, corresponding with the increased number of foreigners entering Malaysia for medical care and the recent government focus on developing the health tourism industry. The Government has also been trying to promote Malaysia as a health care destination, regionally and internationally.|$|E
25|$|The Credit CARD Act of 2009 {{requires}} that consumers opt into over-limit charges. Some card issuers have therefore commenced solicitations requesting customers to opt into overlimit fees, presenting {{this as a}} benefit as it may avoid {{the possibility of a}} future transaction being declined. Other issuers have simply discontinued the practice of charging overlimit fees. Whether a customer opts into the overlimit fee or not, banks will in practice have discretion as to whether they choose to authorize transactions above the credit limit or not. Of course, any approved over limit transactions will only result in an overlimit fee for those customers who have opted into the fee. This legislation took effect on 22 February 2010. Following this Act, the <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> required by law to show on a customer's bills {{how long it would take}} them to pay off the balance.|$|E

25|$|People {{with only}} a casual concern for Internet privacy need not achieve total anonymity. Internet users may protect their privacy through {{controlled}} disclosure of personal information. The revelation of IP addresses, non-personally-identifiable profiling, and similar information might become acceptable trade-offs for the convenience that users could otherwise lose using the workarounds needed to suppress such details rigorously. On the other hand, some people desire much stronger privacy. In that case, they may try to achieve Internet anonymity to ensure privacy — use of the Internet without giving any third parties the ability to link the Internet activities to personally-identifiable information of the Internet user. In order to keep their information private, {{people need to be}} careful with what they submit to and look at online. When filling out forms and buying merchandise, that becomes tracked and because the information was not private, some <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> sending Internet users spam and advertising on similar products.|$|E
25|$|Just under {{half the}} world's {{population}} {{is currently on}} the Internet. Roughly 75% {{of those people are}} on social media and ¾ of those folks have social media accounts on their mobile phones. Mobile phone usage is beneficial for social media marketing because mobile phones have social networking capabilities, allowing individuals immediate web browsing and access to social networking sites. Mobile phones have grown at a rapid rate, fundamentally altering the path-to-purchase process by allowing consumers to easily obtain pricing and product information in real time and allowing companies to constantly remind and update their followers. Many <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> putting QR (Quick Response) codes along with products for individuals to access the company website or online services with their smart phones. Retailers use QR codes to facilitate consumer interaction with brands by linking the code to brand websites, promotions, product information, or any other mobile-enabled content. In addition, Real-time bidding use in the mobile advertising industry is high and rising because of its value for on-the-go web browsing. In 2012, Nexage, a provider of real time bidding in mobile advertising, reported a 37% increase in revenue each month. Adfonic, another mobile advertisement publishing platform, reported an increase of 22 billion ad requests that same year.|$|E
500|$|The {{state has}} {{promoted}} foreign direct investment, which has mostly {{come in the}} software and electronics fields; Kolkata is becoming a major hub for the information technology (IT) industry. Rapid industrialisation {{has given rise to}} debates over land acquisition by industry in this agrarian state. NASSCOM–Gartner ranks the West Bengal energy infrastructure the best in the country. Notably, many corporate <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> headquartered in Kolkata, including ITC Limited, India Government Mint, Kolkata, Haldia Petrochemicals, Exide Industries, Hindustan Motors, Bata India, Birla Corporation, CESC Limited, Coal India Limited, Damodar Valley Corporation, PwC India, Peerless Group, Berger Paints, Emami, ABP Group, Bandhan Bank, United Bank of India, UCO Bank, and Allahabad Bank. In the 2010s, events such as adoption of the [...] "Look East" [...] policy by the government of India, the opening of the Nathu La Pass in Sikkim as a border trade-route with China, and the immense interest among the South East Asian countries in entering the Indian market and investing have put Kolkata in an advantageous position for future development, particularly with countries such as Myanmar, which produces oil that India needs.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an effort}} to {{maintain}} their privacy, British Columbia placed amendments on the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPPA), which was enacted as law on October 21, 2004. These amendments aim to place more firm limitations on “storing, accessing, and disclosing of B.C. public sector data by service providers.” These laws only pertain to public sector data and do not cover trans-border or private sector data in Canada. The public sector establishments include an estimated 2,000 “government ministries, hospitals, boards of health, universities and colleges, school boards, municipal governments and certain Crown corporations and agencies.” [...] In response to these laws, many <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> specifically opting to host their sensitive data outside the United States.|$|E
