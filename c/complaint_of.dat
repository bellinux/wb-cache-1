5|$|I am {{of opinion}} {{that by the}} terms and spirit of the statute under which this {{proceeding}} has been had, no other than the district attorney of the county of Genesee (in which the lands intruded upon are situated) could regularly be a relator. The remedy for the act complained of {{is provided by the}} statute, as well as the officers to carry it into execution. It is made the duty of the district attorney to make <b>complaint</b> <b>of</b> all intrusions upon Indian lands forbidden by the act, {{and from time to time}} to make inquiries whether any persons other than Indians are settled upon such lands, and to cause them to be removed in the manner therein prescribed. Without the act, John Blacksmith or any other person could not claim such summary proceedings to remove intruders upon Indian lands; and with the act, no other person is authorized by its provisions to make <b>complaint</b> <b>of</b> such intrusions, or to cause the intruders to be removed, but the district attorney of the county in which the lands are situated.|$|E
5|$|During the project's {{development}} phase, the siting {{and size}} of the Nike-X bases became a major <b>complaint</b> <b>of</b> smaller cities. Originally intended to protect only the largest urban areas, Nike-X was designed to be built at a very large size with many missiles controlled by an expensive computer and radar network. Smaller sites were to be left undefended in the original Nike-X concept since the system was simply too expensive to build with only a few interceptors. These cities complained that they were not only being left open to attack, but that their lack of defenses might make them primary targets. This led to a series of studies on the Small City Defense (SCD) concept. By 1964 SCD had become part of the baseline Nike-X deployment plans, with every major city being provided some level of defensive system.|$|E
5|$|Dwarka, {{along with}} the Okhamandal region, was {{under the rule of}} Gaekwad of Baroda state during the Indian {{rebellion}} of 1857. A war broke out at Okhamandal in 1858 between the local Vaghers and the British. The Vaghers had won the battle and ruled until September 1859. Later, after a joint offensive of the British, the Gaekwads, and other princely state troops, the Vaghers were ousted in 1859. During these operations, led by Colonel Donovan, the temples at Dwarka and Bet Dwarka suffered damage and were looted. A <b>complaint</b> <b>of</b> atrocities by the British was made by the local people of Jamnagar, Porbander, and Kutch, which led to their restoration. In 1861, Dwarakadheesh Temple was renovated by Maharaja Khanderao and the British, who refurbished the shikara. Maharaja Gaikwad of Baroda added a golden pinnacle to the shikara in 1958 during a refurbishment by Shankaracharya of Dwarka. Since 1960, the temple has been maintained by the Government of India.|$|E

40|$|Background Studies using {{conventional}} socioeconomic indicators {{have reported}} inconsistent evidence on socioeconomic differences in <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> insomnia. We lack studies using a comprehensive socioeconomic framework {{over the life}} course ranging from childhood to adulthood. This study therefore aimed to examine the associations of both past and present socioeconomic circumstances with <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> insomnia. Methods Data were derived from cross-sectional postal surveys (2000 – 2002) representative of {{the staff of the}} City of Helsinki, Finland (n = 8960, aged 40 – 60 years). Socioeconomic circumstances were measured by parental education, childhood economic difficulties, own education, occupational class, household income, housing tenure, and current economic difficulties. <b>Complaints</b> <b>of</b> insomnia during the previous month were measured by difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and non-restorative sleep. Logistic regression analysis was used, adjusting for age and marital status. Results <b>Complaints</b> <b>of</b> insomnia {{at least once a week}} were reported by 25 % of women and 21 % of men. Childhood economic difficulties showed associations with <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> insomnia among both women (OR 1. 52; 95 % CI 1. 31 – 1. 76) and men (OR 2. 25; 95 % CI 1. 67 – 3. 02) even after full adjustments. Also current economic difficulties remained associated with <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> insomnia, but only among women (OR 1. 65; 95 % CI 1. 41 – 1. 93). However, education, occupational class, and income showed only limited age-adjusted associations with <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> insomnia and these associations disappeared after full adjustments. Discussion Past and present economic difficulties were strongly associated with current <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> insomnia. Supporting both families with children and adults to cope with their economic difficulties might reduce <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> insomnia in adulthood...|$|R

5|$|The {{cultural}} {{supremacy of}} the Jains steadily diminished from the 12th century; the decline {{began in the}} 10th century after the conquest of the predominantly Jain Rashtrakutas by the Western Chalukya Empire, and {{the defeat of the}} Ganga kingdom by the Cholas of Tanjore. While Veerashaivism flourished in northern Karnataka from the time of Basavanna, Sri Vaishnavism (a branch of Vaishnavism) thrived in the South due to the influence of Ramanujacharya. The Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana and his descendants took to Vaishnavism. Though tolerant of all faiths, the founders of the Vijayanagara Empire and the succeeding kings of the Sangama dynasty were Shaivas by faith (devotees of Shiva) while the later Tuluva dynasty kings were Sri Vaishnavas (followers of Sri Vaishnavism). The Jain population appears to have begun its decline from this period; however, available records include a decree by King Bukka RayaI giving Jains freedom of worship, following their <b>complaint</b> <b>of</b> persecution. Although the influence of Jainism and its literature was on the wane, the coastal areas of modern Karnataka, where important Jain monuments and monoliths were constructed, remained a stronghold. As in earlier centuries, Jain authors wrote about tirthankars, princes and other personages important to the Jain religion. Most famous among Jain poets from the coastal Karnataka region were Ratnakaravarni, Abhinava Vadi Vidyananda, Salva and Nemanna.|$|E

25|$|In Locabail, Mrs. Emmanuel and {{her lawyers}} did nothing after the judge's {{disclosure}} {{of a conflict}} of interest and only sprung into action to complain about bias after learning she had failed in her claims. It was held that the law did not allow Mrs. Emmanuel to have {{the best of both worlds}} by waiting to see how her claims in litigation turned out before pursuing her <b>complaint</b> <b>of</b> bias. Similarly, in Pillai, although the applicant had knowledge of all matters grounding his <b>complaint</b> <b>of</b> bias before judgment was delivered, he only decided to complain after he had lost the appeal. The court found that if he had not lost, it was quite certain that he would not have filed the motion. The doctrine of waiver therefore militated firmly against him.|$|E
