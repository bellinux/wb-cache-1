5|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>won</b> the {{election}} on November 7 with 55 {{percent of the}} vote to Lazio's 43 percent, a difference larger than most observers had expected. <b>Clinton</b> <b>won</b> the traditionally Democratic base of New York City by large margins, and carried suburban Westchester County, but lost heavily populated Long Island, part of which Lazio represented in Congress. She won surprising victories in Upstate counties, such as Cayuga, Rensselaer, and Niagara, to which her win has been attributed.|$|E
5|$|On Super Tuesday, <b>Clinton</b> <b>won</b> {{the largest}} states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states; they almost evenly split the total popular vote. But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for {{his share of}} the popular vote due to better {{exploitation}} of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans chose lesser-known Congressman Rick Lazio {{to replace}} him. The {{election}} included a record $90 million in campaign expenditures between Clinton, Lazio, and Giuliani and national visibility. Clinton showed strength in normally Republican upstate areas and a debate blunder by Lazio solidified Clinton's previously shaky support among women. <b>Clinton</b> <b>won</b> {{the election in}} November 2000 with 55percent of the vote to Lazio's 43percent.|$|E
5000|$|Arizona Senator Jeff Flake said in March 2016 that Garland {{should not}} be {{confirmed}} unless Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>wins</b> the 2016 presidential election. He argued that should <b>Clinton</b> <b>win,</b> Garland should be confirmed in the Senate's lame-duck session because he is less liberal than any nominee Clinton might put forward. After meeting with Garland in April, Flake reiterated this position, saying that confirmation hearings on Garland's nomination {{should not be}} taken up until after the election, so that the American people can choose the next president, unless <b>Clinton</b> <b>wins,</b> in which case, [...] "we ought to approve him quickly." [...] Orrin Hatch echoed this sentiment, saying that he was [...] "open to resolving this nomination after a <b>Clinton</b> <b>win</b> in a lame duck in December." ...|$|R
5000|$|In March 2016, Flake {{said that}} Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court seat vacated {{by the death}} of Antonin Scalia, should not be {{confirmed}} unless Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>wins</b> the 2016 presidential election. He argued that should <b>Clinton</b> <b>win,</b> Garland should be confirmed in the Senate's lame-duck session because he is less liberal than any nominee Clinton might put forward.

50|$|The Democratic {{primaries}} and caucuses concluded with Bernie Sanders winning Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Vermont; and Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>winning</b> Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Clinton received 486 delegates, while Sanders received 321.|$|R
5|$|In 1964 and 1965, <b>Clinton</b> <b>won</b> {{elections}} for class president. From 1964 to 1967, {{he was an}} intern and then a clerk {{in the office of}} Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright. While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Clinton was {{also a member of the}} Order of DeMolay, a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a Freemason. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity.|$|E
5|$|On March 1 ("Super Tuesday"), <b>Clinton</b> <b>won</b> {{seven of}} eleven contests, {{including}} {{a string of}} dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders. She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.|$|E
5|$|The contest drew {{national}} attention. Lazio blundered {{during a}} September debate by seeming to invade Clinton's personal space {{trying to get}} her to sign a fundraising agreement. The campaigns of Clinton and Lazio, along with Giuliani's initial effort, spent a record combined $90 million. <b>Clinton</b> <b>won</b> the election on November 7, 2000, with 55percent of the vote to Lazio's 43percent. She was sworn in as U.S. Senator on January 3, 2001, making her the first (and so far only) woman to have held an elected office either while, or after, serving as first lady.|$|E
50|$|Oregon was won by President Bill Clinton (D) over Senator Bob Dole (R-Kansas), with <b>Clinton</b> <b>winning</b> 47.2% to 39.1% by {{a margin}} of 8.1%. Billionaire {{businessman}} Ross Perot (Reform-Texas) finished in third with 8.8% of the popular vote.|$|R
50|$|Previously, Paterson {{had been}} {{mentioned}} as a possible successor to Senator Hillary <b>Clinton</b> should <b>Clinton</b> <b>win</b> the Democratic nomination and also the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Paterson is currently a Democratic party national convention superdelegate and has endorsed Clinton.|$|R
50|$|California, was won by Incumbent President Bill Clinton (D) over Senator Bob Dole (R), with <b>Clinton</b> <b>winning</b> 51.1% to 38.21% by {{a margin}} of 12.89%. Billionaire {{businessman}} Ross Perot (Reform Party) finished in third with 6.96% of the popular vote.|$|R
5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state <b>Clinton</b> <b>won</b> by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E
5|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>won</b> the 1992 presidential {{election}} (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (0 electoral votes), who ran {{as an independent}} on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was {{a significant part of}} Clinton's success. Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress, the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, Clinton {{announced}} that she would seek a second Senate term. Clinton easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini. The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance. Clinton's eventual opponent {{in the general election}} was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers. <b>Clinton</b> <b>won</b> the election on November 7, 2006, with 67percent of the vote to Spencer's 31percent, carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties. Her campaign spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008. In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.|$|E

Notably, President Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>won</b> Massachusetts in 1996 with 62% of the vote.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Clinton</b> <b>win</b> in Massachusetts {{came as a}} major blow to the Sanders {{campaign}} on Super Tuesday, as {{he had wanted to}} win a blue, largely white and liberal state like Massachusetts resoundingly in order to stay competitive after disappointing losses across the Southeast.|$|R
