5|$|In 1939, {{experiments}} using minced muscle cells {{demonstrated that}} <b>cellular</b> <b>respiration</b> using one oxygen atom can form two adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules, and, in 1941, {{the concept of}} the phosphate bonds of ATP being a form of energy in cellular metabolism was developed by Fritz Albert Lipmann. In the following years, the mechanism behind <b>cellular</b> <b>respiration</b> was further elaborated, although its link to the mitochondria was not known. The introduction of tissue fractionation by Albert Claude allowed mitochondria to be isolated from other cell fractions and biochemical analysis to be conducted on them alone. In 1946, he concluded that cytochrome oxidase and other enzymes responsible for the respiratory chain were isolated to the mitchondria. Eugene Kennedy and Albert Lehninger discovered in 1948 that mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes. Over time, the fractionation method was further developed, improving the quality of the mitochondria isolated, and other elements of cell respiration were determined to occur in the mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|Metabolism {{is usually}} {{divided into two}} categories: catabolism, the {{breaking}} down of organic matter for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate, by <b>cellular</b> <b>respiration,</b> and anabolism, the building up of components of cells such as proteins and nucleic acids. Usually, breaking down releases energy and building up consumes energy.|$|E

Other mutant alleles of the FH gene, located on human Chromosome 1 at position 1q42.1, cause multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomata, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. Fumarase deficiency {{is one of the few}} known deficiencies of the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle, the main enzymatic pathway of <b>cellular</b> aerobic <b>respiration.</b>|$|R

5|$|Once {{growth and}} {{development}} are completed, vitamins remain essential nutrients for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs {{that make up a}} multicellular organism; they also enable a multicellular life form to efficiently use chemical energy provided by food it eats, and to help process the proteins, carbohydrates, and fats required for <b>cellular</b> <b>respiration.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the energy}} thus {{captured}} produces biomass and energy that is available for growth and development of other life forms. The majority {{of the rest of}} this biomass and energy are lost as waste molecules and heat. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are metabolism and <b>cellular</b> <b>respiration.</b>|$|E
5|$|These {{mechanisms}} can {{be divided}} into single-substrate and multiple-substrate mechanisms. Kinetic studies on enzymes that only bind one substrate, such as triosephosphate isomerase, aim to measure the affinity with which the enzyme binds this substrate and the turnover rate. Some other examples of enzymes are phosphofructokinase and hexokinase, both of which are important for <b>cellular</b> <b>respiration</b> (glycolysis).|$|E
50|$|If {{not enough}} energy is taken in through diet, {{as in the}} process of starvation, the body will use protein from the muscle mass to meet its energy needs, leading to muscle wasting over time.If the {{individual}} does not consume adequate protein in nutrition, then muscle will also waste as more vital <b>cellular</b> processes (e.g. <b>respiration</b> enzymes, blood cells) recycle muscle protein for their own requirements.|$|R
40|$|Mitochondria {{are central}} to many <b>cellular</b> {{processes}} including <b>respiration,</b> ion homeostasis, and apoptosis. Using computational predictions combined with traditional quantitative experiments, we have identified 100 proteins whose deficiency alters mitochondrial biogenesis and inheritance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, we used computational predictions to perform targeted double-mutant analysis detecting another nine genes with synthetic defects in mitochondrial biogenesis. This represents an increase of about 25 % over previously known participants. Nearly half of these newly characterized proteins are conserved in mammals, including several orthologs known {{to be involved in}} human disease.

40|$|Blackleg is an {{economically}} important disease of cattle, sheep and other ruminants which is endemic in both {{developed and developing}} countries of the world. Toxins and neuraminidase produced by Clostridium chauvoei {{have been reported to}} play significant complimentary roles in the pathogenesis of the disease. In this study, the pathological changes caused by exogenous toxins produced following the culture of C. chauvoei at 24 and 48 h respectively were investigated and it was observed that the 24 h toxin produced more severe pathological changes, compared to the 48 h toxin. Necrosis was observed in the tissues examined, both grossly and histopathologically and was attributed probably to impaired <b>cellular</b> (mitochondrial) <b>respiration.</b> It was concluded that, although toxins produced by C. chauvoei {{play an important role in}} the mechanisms of blackleg, the role of leukotrienes (C 4, D 4 and E 4), cytokines (interleukin- 1, IL- 1; tumour necrosis factor-, TNF-), platelet-activating factor, interferon, complement fragments (anaphylatoxins C 5 a and C 3 a), prostaglandins and neuraminidase in the pathogenesis of C. chauvoei infection in mice need to be thoroughly investigated...|$|R
5|$|Iron {{plays an}} {{important}} role in biology, forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with <b>cellular</b> <b>respiration</b> and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals. A human male of average height has about 4 grams of iron in his body, a female about 3.5 grams. This iron is distributed throughout the body in hemoglobin, tissues, muscles, bone marrow, blood proteins, enzymes, ferritin, hemosiderin, and transport in plasma.|$|E
5|$|Cyanogenic glycosides {{are stored}} in {{inactive}} forms in plant vacuoles. They become toxic when herbivores eat the plant and break cell membranes allowing the glycosides to {{come into contact with}} enzymes in the cytoplasm releasing hydrogen cyanide which blocks <b>cellular</b> <b>respiration.</b> Glucosinolates are activated {{in much the same way}} as cyanogenic glucosides, and the products can cause gastroenteritis, salivation, diarrhea, and irritation of the mouth. Benzoxazinoids, secondary defence metabolites, which are characteristic for grasses (Poaceae), are also stored as inactive glucosides in the plant vacuole. Upon tissue disruption they get into contact with β-glucosidases from the chloroplasts, which enzymatically release the toxic aglucones. Whereas some benzoxazinoids are constitutively present, others are only synthesised following herbivore infestation, and thus, considered inducible plant defenses against herbivory.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{physiology}} encompasses all {{the internal}} chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life. Chemicals {{obtained from the}} air, soil and water {{form the basis of}} all plant metabolism. The energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by <b>cellular</b> <b>respiration,</b> is the basis of almost all life. Photoautotrophs, including all green plants, algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. Heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues. Respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome C has two {{apparently}} separable <b>cellular</b> functions: <b>respiration</b> and caspase activation during apoptosis. While a {{role of the}} mitochondria and cytochrome C in {{the assembly}} of the apoptosome and caspase activation has been established for mammalian cells, {{the existence of a}} comparable function for cytochrome C in invertebrates remains controversial. Drosophila possesses two cytochrome c genes, cyt-c-d and cyt-c-p. We show that only cyt-c-d is required for caspase activation in an apoptosis-like process during spermatid differentiation, whereas cyt-c-p is required for respiration in the soma. However, both cytochrome C proteins can function interchangeably in respiration and caspase activation, and the difference in their genetic requirements can be attributed to differential expression in the soma and testes. Furthermore, orthologues of the apoptosome components, Ark (Apaf- 1) and Dronc (caspase- 9), are also required for the proper removal of bulk cytoplasm during spermatogenesis. Finally, several mutants that block caspase activation during spermatogenesis were isolated in a genetic screen, including mutants with defects in spermatid mitochondrial organization. These observations establish a role for the mitochondria in caspase activation during spermatogenesis...|$|R
50|$|Yersiniabactin (Ybt) is a {{siderophore}} {{found in}} the pathogenic bacteria Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia enterocolitica, {{as well as several}} strains of enterobacteria including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Siderophores, compounds of low molecular mass with high affinities for ferric iron, are important virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria. Iron, an essential element for life utilized by such <b>cellular</b> processes as <b>respiration</b> and DNA replication, is extensively chelated by host proteins like lactoferrin and ferritin; thus, the pathogen produces molecules with an even higher affinity for Fe3+ than these proteins in order to acquire sufficient iron for growth. As a part of such an iron-uptake system, yersiniabactin {{plays an important role in}} pathogenicity of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. entercolitica.|$|R

5|$|Since inhibitors {{modulate}} {{the function}} of enzymes they are often used as drugs. Many such drugs are reversible competitive inhibitors that resemble the enzyme's native substrate, similar to methotrexate above; other well-known examples include statins used to treat high cholesterol, and protease inhibitors used to treat retroviral infections such as HIV. A common example of an irreversible inhibitor that {{is used as a}} drug is aspirin, which inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes that produce the inflammation messenger prostaglandin. Other enzyme inhibitors are poisons. For example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks <b>cellular</b> <b>respiration.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen cyanide is a {{poisonous}} gas that interferes with <b>cellular</b> <b>respiration.</b> Cyanide prevents the cell from producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by binding {{to one of}} the proteins involved in the electron transport chain. This protein, cytochrome c oxidase, contains several subunits and has ligands containing iron groups. The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, heme a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand pi bonding. As a result of the formation of this new iron-cyanide complex, the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound; thus, the heme group no longer accept them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP. In a human weighing , death occurs within two minutes of inhaling 70mg of hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} plants is vital because they {{underpin}} almost all animal life on Earth by generating {{a large proportion}} of the oxygen and food that provide humans and other organisms with aerobic respiration with the chemical energy they need to exist. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of organisms that carry out photosynthesis, a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells. As a by-product of photosynthesis, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out <b>cellular</b> <b>respiration.</b> In addition, they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils, preventing soil erosion. Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food, oxygen, medicine, and products for people, as well as creating and preserving soil.|$|E
40|$|Fe excess is {{believed}} to generate oxidative stress. To contribute {{to the understanding of}} Fe metabolism, Fe excess was induced in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia grown in hydroponic culture upon root cutting. Toxicity symptoms leading to brown spots covering the leaf surface became visible after 6 h. Photosynthesis was greatly affected within 12 h; the photosynthetic rate was decreased by 40 %. Inhibition of photosynthesis was accompanied by photoinhibition, increased reduction of photosystem II, and higher thylakoid energization. Fe excess seemed to stimulate photorespiration because catalase activity doubled. To cope with <b>cellular</b> damage, <b>respiration</b> rate increased and cytosolic glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity more than doubled. Simultaneously, the content of free hexoses was reduced. Indicative of generation of oxidative stress was doubling of ascorbate peroxidase activity within 12 h. Contents of the antioxidants ascorbate and glutathione were reduced by 30 %, resulting in equivalent increases of dehydroascorbate and oxidized glutathione. Taken together, moderate changes in leaf Fe content have a dramatic effect on plant metabolism. This indicates that cellular Fe concentrations must be finely regulated to avoid cellular damage most probably because of oxidative stress induced by Fe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work we develop a {{real-time}} electrochemical mediator assay {{to enable the}} assessment of cell numbers and chemical toxicity.

We demonstrated that the FcA-based oxygen assay is highly sensitive, and using a population of cells, oxygen consumption rates could be calculated down to a single cell level. More importantly, the results can be accomplished in minutes, considerably outperforming current commercially available biooxygen demand assays. The developed assay is expected to have a significant impact in diverse fields and industries, ranging from environmental toxicology through to pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries...|$|R
40|$|Free living viruses are {{ubiquitous}} {{in marine waters}} and concentrations are usually several {{times higher than the}} bacterial abundance. These viruses are capable of lysing host bacteria and therefore, {{play an important role in}} the microbial loop in oligotrophic waters. However, few studies have been conducted to compare the role of viruses in regulating bacterial abundance and heterotrophic activities between natural oligotrophic waters and anthropogenic influenced eutrophic waters. In this study, we examined viral effects on bacterial functions of four single bacterial species incubated with natural viral assemblages in seawater samples from eutrophic and oligotrophic waters. The viral-lysis of bacteria was significantly higher in eutrophic than oligotrophic waters. This suggests that viruses were capable of controlling bacterial abundance, respiration and production in the eutrophic waters. <b>Cellular</b> bacterial <b>respiration</b> and production was higher with viruses than without viruses, which was more evident in the oligotrophic waters. These results indicate that viruses can slow down bacterial consumption of oxygen and reduce bacteria-induced eutrophication effects in anthropogenic eutrophic waters, but switch to the role of sustaining the bacterial population when nutrients are limiting. There were bacterial species differences in resisting viral attack, which can influence the dominance and biodiversity of bacterial species in coastal waters...|$|R

40|$|Iron is an {{essential}} nutrient for both humans and pathogenic microbes. Because {{of its ability to}} exist in one of two oxidation states, iron is an ideal redox catalyst for diverse <b>cellular</b> processes including <b>respiration</b> and DNA replication. However, the redox potential of iron also contributes to its toxicity; thus, iron concentration and distribution must be carefully controlled. Given the absolute requirement for iron by virtually all human pathogens, an important facet of the innate immune system is to limit iron availability to invading microbes in a process termed nutritional immunity. Successful human pathogens must therefore possess mechanisms to circumvent nutritional immunity in order to cause disease.

Previously {{studies have shown that}} mice and rats fed diets lacking in pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) have reduced mitochondrial content. Therefore, we hypothesized that PQQ can induce mitochondrial biogenesis in mouse hepatocytes. Exposure of mouse Hepa 1 – 6 cells to 10 – 30 μm PQQ for 24 – 48 h resulted in increased citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase activity, Mitotracker staining, mitochondrial DNA content, and <b>cellular</b> oxygen <b>respiration.</b> The induction of this process occurred through the activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator- 1 α (PGC- 1 α), a pathway known to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. PQQ exposure stimulated phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133, activated the promoter of PGC- 1 α, and increased PGC- 1 α mRNA and protein expression. PQQ did not stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis after small interfering RNA-mediated reduction in either PGC- 1 α or CREB expression. Consistent with activation of the PGC- 1 α pathway, PQQ increased nuclear respiratory factor activation (NRF- 1 and NRF- 2) and Tfam, TFB 1 M, and TFB 2 M mRNA expression. Moreover, PQQ protected cells from mitochondrial inhibition by rotenone, 3 -nitropropionic acid, antimycin A, and sodium azide. The ability of PQQ to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis accounts in part for action of this compound and suggests that PQQ may be beneficial in diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction...|$|R
