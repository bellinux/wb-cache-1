5|$|West Point {{began the}} collegiate {{tradition}} of the class ring, beginning with the class of 1835. The class of 1836 chose no rings, and the class of 1879 had <b>cuff</b> <b>links</b> {{in lieu of a}} class ring. Before 1917, cadets could design much of the ring individually, but now only the center stone can be individualized. One side of the ring bears the academy crest, while the other side bears the class crest and the center stone ring bears the words West Point and the class year. The academy library has a large collection of cadet rings on display. Senior cadets receive their rings during Ring Weekend in the early fall of their senior year. Immediately after senior cadets return to the barracks after receiving their rings, fourth class cadets take the opportunity to surround senior cadets from their company and ask to touch their rings. After reciting a poem known to cadets as the Ring Poop, the senior usually grants the freshmen permission to touch the ring. In 2002, the Memorial Class ring donor program began. Donations of class rings are melted and merged. A portion of the original gold is infused with gold from preceding melts {{to become part of the}} rings for each 'Firstie' class.|$|E
25|$|The Formal Dress {{variation}} {{is the most}} formal, and {{is identical to the}} Dinner Dress Blue Jacket uniform but worn with a white waistcoat with gold buttons in place of the cummerbund, a white bow tie, and matching mother-of-pearl studs and <b>cuff</b> <b>links.</b> Though rarely used, men can also substitute a tailcoat for the standard dinner dress jacket with this uniform. The female version is substantially the same as Dinner Dress Blue Jacket, but substitutes the mother-of-pearl studs and <b>cuff</b> <b>links</b> for gold. This uniform is equivalent to white tie in usage. Additionally, this uniform is only prescribed for chiefs and officers.|$|E
25|$|On 19 February 1931, Lindrum gave a billiards {{exhibition}} for the King {{and other}} members of the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace. King George V presented Lindrum with a pair of gold and enamel <b>cuff</b> <b>links</b> bearing the royal monogram. These formed part of Lindrum's essential attire for the remainder of his playing career, and he wore them daily for the rest of his life.|$|E
40|$|Context: Closed kinetic chain {{exercises}} {{are reported to}} provide a more functional rehabilitation outcome. Objective: To determine the amount of muscle activity in 4 shoulder muscles during exercise on the <b>Cuff</b> <b>Link.</b> Design: Repeated measures. Setting: Laboratory. Subjects: 10 men and 10 women, age 18 - 50. Intervention: Subjects performed 3 sets of 5 revolutions on the <b>Cuff</b> <b>Link</b> in non-weight-bearing, partial-weight-bearing, and full-weight-bearing positions. Main Outcome Measures: Electromyography data were collected from the upper trapezius, anterior deltoid, serratus anterior, and pectoralis major and were expressed as percentage of maximal isometric contractions. Results: Significant differences were found across the weight-bearing conditions for all 4 muscles. Exercise on the <b>Cuff</b> <b>Link</b> required minimal to significant amounts of muscle recruitment. Conclusions: Muscle recruitment increases as weight bearing increases during use of the <b>Cuff</b> <b>Link,</b> suggesting an increase in dynamic stabilization of the glenohumeral joint...|$|R

25|$|Marden {{discovered}} {{the remains of}} Captain Bligh's HMS Bounty in January 1957. After spotting a rudder from this ship in a museum on Fiji, he persuaded his editors to let him dive off Pitcairn Island, where the rudder had been recovered. Despite the warnings of one islander—"Man, you gwen be dead as a hatchet!"—Marden dived for several days in the dangerous swells near the island and found {{the remains of the}} fabled ship. He subsequently met with Marlon Brando to counsel him on his role as Fletcher Christian in the 1962 film Mutiny on the Bounty. Later in life, when he stuck with his tailored English suits while his colleagues wore more casual attire, Marden also wore <b>cuff</b> <b>links</b> made of nails from the Bounty. MGM had a reconstruction of the Bounty built for their 1962 film, also named Bounty. This vessel was built, of wood, to the original plans, in a traditional manner in a shipyard in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. However, all the dimensions were increased by approximately one third to accommodate the large cameras in use at that time.|$|E
500|$|Of {{the coins}} {{that were not}} redeemed, some were likely lost in the fires that devastated Honolulu's Chinatown in 1887 and 1900. [...] Members of that {{community}} were often distrustful of banks, and hid valuables in their homes. Quantities of the remainder {{were used in the}} jewelry trade, which bought several thousand dollars worth in the final months the coins remained legal tender. In the years after territorial status was granted Hawaii in 1900, many sought keepsakes of the vanished kingdom, and a large variety of souvenir items featuring the coins were [...] sold as enameled (and unenameled) jewelry: pins, watch fobs, <b>cuff</b> <b>links,</b> belt buckles, hat bands and hat pins. Decorative items such as spoons and napkin rings were also made. Generally, the side featuring the coat of arms is the one enameled.|$|E
500|$|Development and {{production}} for Tucker: The Man and His Dream included {{the involvement of}} Tucker's children and grandchildren. Jeff Bridges was cast {{in the title role}} and, for research, studied Preston Tucker's mannerisms and movements through home movies. Tucker's descendants also granted Bridges the opportunity to sport the man's black pearl ring and <b>cuff</b> <b>links</b> for his wardrobe. Preston's son, John Tucker, said that Bridges has [...] "got it all in the mannerisms and the look. My father was very positive, always thinking of what came next. Jeff captures that." [...] Martin Landau was enthusiastic about accepting the pivotal role of Abe Karatz as a means to avoid typecasting. The construct of family values {{played a crucial role in}} the Tuckers' life and Coppola studiously selected Joan Allen for the part of Vera, Tucker's devoted wife while Christian Slater and Elias Koteas fill in the other central roles of eldest son and Tucker's friend and confederate, Alex Tremulis. Coppola's family was undergoing a stressful time during the production and he dedicated the film to Gio, his eldest son, who died before filming began.|$|E

5000|$|The next day, Rodion brings Cincinnatus {{the morning}} papers, which {{are filled with}} {{pictures}} of his house, Marthe, his two kids, and himself. Our omniscient narrator then expounds on Cincinnatus' life, explaining his peculiar circumstances as a child --"the son of an unknown transient" [...] and Cecilia C. (pg. 24) having been raised in an orphanage. Afterward, the lawyer Roman enters looking for his lost <b>cuff</b> <b>link</b> and once again, Cincinnatus presses him about his execution date, to no avail however. Rodrig arrives, having found the missing <b>cuff</b> <b>link,</b> and also tells Cincinnatus {{that he will be}} getting a cellmate to keep him company. Cincinnatus doesn't take too kindly to this idea, and is eventually chided by both men for being discourteous.|$|R
500|$|Kai Owen {{describes}} Thomas, Morgan and Hughes collectively with Robin Griffith (Barry Williams) as a [...] "good old-fashioned Welsh cast {{who know}} what it's all about". Jonathan Lewis Owen was cast as Rhys' best man [...] "Banana Boat" [...] a character referred to sporadically since Torchwoods first series premiere [...] "Everything Changes" [...] (2006). In keeping with the character's name {{he was given a}} pair of banana patterned <b>cuff</b> <b>links</b> to compliment his costume. As a joke, Eve Myles (who Jonathan Owen had previously worked with in other projects) left a banana skin on his car on his first day of filming. Collette Brown played [...] "Carrie", the original human form of the mother Nostrovite. To transform her into the alien creature the actress was required to spend approximately an hour having make-up applied. Brown was surprised at the efficiency of the make-up artists as she had expected the transformation process to take longer. Originally, the human versions of the Nostrovite shapeshifter were intended to be more monstrous but Davies felt it was important that the audience would still be able to recognise the actor underneath once the make up had been applied.|$|E
500|$|Formby {{continued}} filming with ATP, and {{his second}} film of 1940, Spare a Copper, was again focused on {{an aspect of the}} war, this time combating fifth columnists and saboteurs in a Merseyside dockyard. Cinema-goers had begun to tire of war films, and his next venture, Turned Out Nice Again returned to less contentious issues, with Formby's character caught in a domestic battle between his new wife and mother. Early in the filming schedule, he took time to perform in an ENSA show that was broadcast on the BBC from Aldwych tube station as Let the People Sing; he sang four songs, and told the audience, [...] "Don't forget, it's wonderful to be British!" [...] Towards the end of 1940 Formby tried to enlist for active military service, despite Beryl informing him that by being a member of ENSA he was already signed up. The examining board rejected him as being unfit, because he had sinusitis and arthritic toes. He spent the winter season in pantomime at the Opera House Theatre, Blackpool, portraying Idle Jack in Dick Whittington. When the season came to an end the Formbys moved to London and, in May 1941, performed for the royal family at Windsor Castle. He had commissioned a new set of inoffensive lyrics for [...] "When I'm Cleaning Windows", but was informed that he should sing the original, uncensored version, which was enjoyed by the royal party, particularly Queen Mary, who asked for a repeat of the song. King George VI presented Formby with a set of gold <b>cuff</b> <b>links,</b> and advised him to [...] "wear them, not put them away".|$|E

40|$|Context: The <b>Cuff</b> <b>Link</b> is {{a closed}} kinetic chain {{rehabilitation}} apparatus {{for the upper}} extremity. Limited research has established its effectiveness to elicit muscle activation of the scapular muscles. Objective: To determine if scapular muscle activation differs in response to 2 upper extremity closed kinetic chain exercises: <b>Cuff</b> <b>Link</b> and standard push-up. Design: A single-group, repeated-measures design. Setting: Controlled laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-eight healthy individuals (13 women: age = 19. 69 +/- 1. 55 years, height = 167. 44 +/- 9. 52 cm, mass = 61. 00 +/- 8. 79 kg; 15 men: age 22. 00 +/- 3. 91 years, height = 181. 44 +/- 6. 60 cm, mass 82. 36 +/- 13. 23 kg) with no history of shoulder or low back injury volunteered {{to participate in this}} study. Intervention(s) : Participants performed 10 trials of complete revolutions on the <b>Cuff</b> <b>Link</b> and 10 full-weight-bearing push-ups. We controlled trial velocity and randomized order. Trunk and shoulder positions were normalized to the participant 2 ̆ 7 s height. Using surface electromyography, we recorded muscle activity of the serratus anterior, middle trapezius, and lower trapezius. Rectified and smoothed electromyography data for the serratus anterior, middle trapezius, and lower trapezius were normalized {{as a percentage of the}} maximal voluntary isometric contractions (...|$|R

2500|$|In the 1946 Christmas episode, for example, Benny buys {{shoelaces}} for Don, and {{is unable}} to {{make up his mind}} whether to give Wilson shoelaces with plastic tips or metal tips. After exchanging them repeatedly, Mel Blanc is heard screaming insanely, [...] "Plastic tips! Metal tips! I can't stand it anymore!" [...] A variation in 1948 was with an expensive wallet, but repeatedly changing the greeting card, prompting Blanc to shout, [...] "I haven't run into anyone like you in 20 years! Oh, why did the governor have to give me that pardon!?" [...] Benny then realizes that he should have gotten Don a wallet for $1.98, whereupon the store clerk responds by committing suicide. Over the years, in the Christmas episodes, Benny bought and repeatedly exchanged <b>cuff</b> <b>links,</b> golf tees, a box of dates, a paint set (water colors or oils), and a gopher trap. In later years, Benny would encounter Mel Blanc's wife (played by Jean Vander Pyl) or the clerk's psychiatrist at the store, and drive them crazy as well.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} muscle activity of pectoralis major, serratus anterior, teres major, and latissimus dorsi during an exercise performed on the Cufif Link utilizing normal subjects. Forty-four subjects performed a rotation exercise in a clockwise direction at a speed of 58 beats per minute. Three trials were completed using the push-up handles and the large-diameter hemisphere. Surface electromyography recorded the activity of the four muscles. Recorded EMG values were normalized as a percentage of the maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVTC).
