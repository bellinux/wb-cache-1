40|$|Ray Mead (1921 - 1998) {{was one of}} just {{a handful}} of {{painters}} working in English Canada whose career followed abstraction from its early (and often maligned) inception, through its "heroic" phases (in the late 1950 s and 60 s) and into its current decline as an influential avant-garde practice. His later work, though continually done in a formally Modernist style, nonetheless had a little of what could be dramatically called postmodern sentimentality. This thesis not only documents Mead's development as an artist, but also examines his work within the shifting context of modern and postmodern ideologies [...] especially as they relate to the changing notions of subjectivity. The underlying premise is that abstract painting is anthropomorphic by sight alone. Within this scenario the "eye" (the limiting <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight)</b> becomes a model for the ego's place in the world as a reflexive entity (or the conditions of the "I"). Thus, "subject matter" is as much an issue for the viewer today, as it was an ongoing question for painters working in the 1950 s. By engaging such theorists as Jean-François Lyotard, Immanuel Kant, Clement Greenberg, Jacques Lacan and Slavoj Zizek, formal changes in Mead's work are related to developing ideas of subjectivity, as his painting moved from an aesthetics of the Beautiful (favouring consensus, completeness, consistency and wholeness of form) towards an aesthetics of the Sublime (a fleeting sense of joy and terror {{in the face of the}} unpresentable...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} perform the {{characterization}} and modeling of MIMO BFWA (Broadband Fixed Wireless Access) channels in outdoor-indoor environments, several measurement campaigns were carried out on the 3.5 [*]GHz frequency band with a bandwidth of 250 [*]MHz. The measurements were made between two buildings of the University of Cantabria (Spain) separated by a distance of 120 [*]m. The transmitter array was positioned as a base station on the terrace of a building, while the receiver was placed inside the other building in three scenarios with different characteristics. The first scenario is an assembly room, an open area with few obstacles around the receiver array (denoted as open). The second scenario is an electronics laboratory equipped with computers, workbenches, measuring equipment, and cupboards (denoted as closed). These two scenarios are at a height around 6 [*]m lower than the transmitter. The third scenario is a typical office floor, at a height of 15 meters below the transmitter. The influence of the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> between the transmitter and the receiver is considered in the channel characterization, placing the receiver array in three different local areas for each measurement scenario. The first measurement area was located close to a window, opposite the transmitter, in a QLOS (quasiline <b>of</b> <b>sight)</b> situation. In this area, the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> was only obstructed by a window. On moving away from this window and going into the room, the visual line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> between the transmitter and the receiver was lost. In these <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> nonline <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> measurements are made in two local areas, NLOS (Nonline <b>of</b> <b>Sight),</b> in which the receiver is already indoors in the building but {{only one of the}} inner walls obstructs the direct <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the transmitter, and HNLOS (Hard-NLOS), in which the transmitter is located in an indoor zone of the building with several partitions between the transmitter and the receiver.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Real-time pose {{estimation}} {{systems are}} fundamentally difficult to evaluate. Pose estimation performance {{is a function}} of the object geometry, environmental <b>conditions,</b> line <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> sensor characteristics, algorithm characteristics, and computational platform. This paper presents lessons learned from Neptec’s two operational space systems for real-time dynamic pose estimation: the Space Vision System used by NASA for assembling the International Space Station, and the TriDAR Autonomous Rendezvous & Docking System used for spacecraft docking to the International Space Station and automated satellite servicing. Lessons learned are discussed in the context of design, trade-offs, challenges, and performance evaluation. This paper also discusses applying the lessons towards adapting these technologies for other applications. These lessons result in a proposed generalized framework for performance evaluation of pose estimation systems. Such a task is not without challenges given the reliance of pose estimation on so many factors external to the system. Shape-based, targetless systems are particularly difficult to evaluate given the potential range of object shapes and views. However, predictable performance is critical for the success of space operations and NASA’s strict requirements have provided many valuable lessons towards performance predictability. Collaborative research is presented on metrics for quantifying shape with respect to pose estimation, providing a potential means for evaluating and predicting system performance with respect to shape properties.

40|$|Abstract Background & aim: Mirror {{therapy is}} a {{relatively}} new intervention which focuses on moving the defective part in front of the mirror. The intervention is proposed to be an important implement to improve stability during rehabilitation program of the amputee. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of 12 sessions of mirror therapy on postural control kinetic variables of amputees when manipulating sensory information. Methods: In the present quasi-experimental study with pretest-posttest and random group design, 14 below knee amputees (n = 7 control and n = 7 experimental) were enrolled. The experimental group engaged in 12 session of exercise therapy in front of mirror, but the control group just did their daily routine activities without any intervention. To asses postural control, Computerized Dynamic Posturography was used which shows the balance score according to two variables of stability and displacement of the center of gravity while manipulating sensory organization in 6 conditions (absence or presence of vision, presence or manipulation of vestibular and kinesthetic information). For data analysis, multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) with repeated measures and Bonferroni post-hoc test were used. Results: The results indicated that postural control improved in the experimental group compared to the control group in all six sensory manipulation conditions. The balance improvement in the mirror therapy group in the first <b>condition</b> (existence <b>of</b> three senses of vision, vestibular and kinesthetic) and second <b>condition</b> (elimination <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> and presence <b>of</b> vestibular and kinesthetic information) was higher than other circumstances. Balance scores were worse in <b>condition</b> 6 (manipulation <b>of</b> vestibular and kinesthetic) in the control group compared to other sensory <b>conditions.</b> Conclusion: Findings <b>of</b> the research revealed that 12 sessions of mirror therapy can improve balance in people with below knee amputations. Moreover, application of mirror in exercise sessions can reduce the amplitude of fluctuation and increase alignment and strategies, which helps promotion of balance control...|$|R

50|$|Vesely's {{argument}} on the epistemological {{process of being}} situated develops {{in terms of an}} analogy to the formation of the visual field. And takes the organic ability <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> only as a point of departure to the phenomenon of vision, i.e. what one is able to recognize and know out of visual perception. Accordingly, the natural process of seeing is shown to be a result from learning. Vesely presents the example <b>of</b> inborn <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> blindness treated through surgery, where sight itself only emerges after a painful stage of learning, and without which, the recently acquired sense <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> would be unable to detach or recognize individual objects out of a 'visual field' (pp. 50-51).

This research aims to fill this gap by examining how employees change following the introduction of a new change initiative. Specifically, I investigate how employee knowledge of (1) a change objective (i. e., line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives) and (2) how to best affect the objective (i. e., line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions) changes following the introduction of a change initiative. To better understand potential attributes that may affect the trajectory of the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> constructs, I take a social cognitive approach to suggest five potential moderators (i. e., locus of control, interaction quality, valence, learning goal orientation, self-efficacy) based on the five core concepts of social cognitive theory (i. e., agency, observational learning, valued outcomes, goals, self-efficacy). Additionally, I propose a potential trajectory for behavioral alignment, based on a theory of change momentum; and, I examine the potential moderating effects of learning on the behavioral alignment trajectory. I also examine a potential pathway in which line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions mediate the relationship between line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives and behavioral alignment with the same five social cognitive facets as proposed moderators. In a sample of 189 fast food employees, partial support is found for the alignment model.

Methods: In this quasi-empirical, 20 lower limb amputees and 20 healthy subjects participated and assigned into 2 groups. To assess postural control and balance, Computerized Dynamic Posturography was used. Using sensory organization test, balance was measured in 6 <b>conditions</b> (first: existence <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> hearing and proprioception; second: Elimination of sight; third: Manipulation of vestibular system; fourth: Manipulation of proprioception; fifth: Elimination <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> and manipulation <b>of</b> proprioception and sixth: Manipulation of vestibular system and proprioception).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Anhedonia, {{a loss of}} {{interest}} and pleasure in normally rewarding stimuli, is a key diagnostic criterion for major depression. It {{has been suggested that}} deficits in the processing of reward-relevant stimuli could represent an endophenotype for depression. We hypothesized that people at risk of depression by virtue of a personal history of the illness would show impaired neural responses to a primary rewarding stimulus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured the neural response to the <b>sight</b> and flavor <b>of</b> chocolate, and their combination, in 13 unmedicated recovered patients with a history of major depression and 14 healthy controls matched for age and gender. We also examined a control aversive <b>condition</b> consisting <b>of</b> the <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> moldy strawberries and a corresponding unpleasant taste. Participants simultaneously recorded subjective ratings of "pleasantness," "intensity," and "wanting. " RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Despite no differences between the groups in stimulus ratings, patients showed decreased neural responses to the pleasant stimulus in the ventral striatum and increases in the caudate nucleus to the aversive stimulus. Furthermore, patients had a diminished neural supralinearity response (the potentiation produced by simultaneous presentation <b>of</b> the <b>sight</b> and flavor <b>of</b> the stimuli) in the prefrontal cortex for both aversive and pleasant conditions. Patients recovered from depression appear to have deficits in the neural basis of reward and may also have impairments in the cross-modal integration of sensory stimuli. CONCLUSION: These findings support the view that abnormal neural responses to reward may be an endophenotype for depression and a potential target for intervention and prevention strategies...|$|R
