Mickey's face is more flushed, seemingly less from exertion, than embarrassment for and perhaps schadenfreude towards Donald.

50|$|In {{a general}} axonometry of a sphere the image contour is an ellipse. The <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> a sphere is a circle only in an {{orthogonal}} axonometry. But, as the engineer projection {{and the standard}} isometry are scaled orthograhic projections, the <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> a sphere is a circle in these cases, as well. As the diagram shows, an ellipse as the <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> a sphere might be confusing, so, if a sphere {{is part of an}} object to be mapped, one should choose an orthogonal axonometry or an engineer projection or a standard isometry.|$|R

5|$|Originally, {{the grass}} on the putting greens was the wide-bladed Bermuda. The greens lost speed, {{especially}} during the late 1970s, after {{the introduction of a}} healthier strain of narrow-bladed Bermuda, which thrived and grew thicker. In 1978, the greens on the par 3 course were reconstructed with bentgrass, a narrow-bladed species that could be mowed shorter, eliminating grain. After this test run, the greens on the main course were replaced with bentgrass in time for the 1981 Masters. The bentgrass resulted in significantly faster putting surfaces, which has required a reduction in some of the <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> the greens over time.|$|E

It is thought that irregular and often blemished pieces of wood were used in their entirety rather than squared off due to the scarcity of wood on the island.|$|E

40|$|Psychophysical {{researches}} on {{the human}} visual system {{have shown that the}} points of high curvature on the <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> an object {{play an important role in}} the recognition process. Inspired by these studies we propose: (i) a novel algorithm to select points of high curvature on the <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> an object which can be used to construct a recognizable polygonal approximation, (ii) a test which evaluates the effect <b>of</b> deletion <b>of</b> <b>contour</b> segments containing such points on the performance <b>of</b> <b>contour</b> based object recognition algorithms. We use complete <b>contour</b> representations <b>of</b> objects as a reference (training) set. Incomplete <b>contour</b> representations <b>of</b> the same objects are used as a test set. The performance of an algorithm is reported using the recognition rate as a function of the percentage <b>of</b> <b>contour</b> retained. We consider two types <b>of</b> <b>contour</b> incompleteness obtained by deletion <b>of</b> <b>contour</b> segments <b>of</b> high or low curvature. We illustrate the test procedure using two shape recognition algorithms that deploy a shape context and a distance multiset as local shape descriptors. Both algorithms qualitatively mimic human visual perception in that the deletion of segments of high curvature has a stronger performance degradation effect than the deletion of other parts <b>of</b> the <b>contour.</b> This effect is more pronounced in the performance of the shape context method. ...|$|R

5|$|Glue binder {{was often}} used as an {{inexpensive}} alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55). The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the glaze.|$|E

5|$|One {{theory is}} that the sculptures {{represent}} deceased individuals with bloated bodies, closed eyes, distended bellies and puffed out faces. The position of the limbs on some monuments, although following the natural <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> the boulder, give an impression of the position of corpses found in later Maya burial bundles. It is possible that Pasaco Monument 2 and the potbelly from San Juan Sacatepéquez portray the placement of a jade bead in the mouth of the sculpture. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the monuments themselves are burial markers, only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains. One of these is a ceramic potbelly from Colha in Belize, the others are from Chalchuapa and Kaminaljuyu. However, since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers.|$|E
5|$|The North Group was {{occupied}} from the Terminal Classic {{through to the}} Postclassic. This group's structures were built using a different method {{from those in the}} Central Group, and were made out of compacted clay without stone construction or facing. The group occupies Terraces7 through 9, which follow the <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> the natural terracing present and show no evidence of significant artificial levelling. In combination with a noted absence of sculptured monuments, the different construction methods and ceramic assemblages associated with this group imply an occupation of the North Group by a new settlement community who arrived in the Late Classic period, most probably K'iche' Maya from the highlands.|$|E
5|$|The accompaniment for a Peking opera {{performance}} usually {{consists of}} a small ensemble of traditional melodic and percussion instruments. The lead melodic instrument is the jinghu, a small, high-pitched, two-string spike fiddle. The jinghu is the primary accompaniment for performers during songs. Accompaniment is heterophonic – the jinghu player follows the basic <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> the song's melody, but diverges in pitch and other elements. The jinghu often plays more notes per measure than the performer sings, and does so an octave lower. During rehearsal, the jinghu player adopts {{his or her own}} signature version of the song's melody, but also must adapt to spontaneous improvisations {{on the part of the}} performer due to changed performance conditions. Thus, the jinghu player must have an instinctive ability to change his or her performance without warning to properly accompany the performer.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{the lake}} was fed by the River Westbourne {{entering}} at the Italian Garden at the north-western end of the Long Water. The Westbourne ceased to provide the water for the Serpentine in 1834, as the river had become polluted, and so water was then pumped from the Thames. The water is now supplied by three boreholes drilled into the Upper Chalk. The first borehole {{is located at the}} Italian Gardens, the second at the Diana Memorial and the third, drilled in 2012 to a depth of 132m, is within 50m of the Diana Memorial. The Long Water runs south-east from this point to Serpentine Bridge, where the lake curves to the east, following the natural <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> the land. At the eastern end, water flows out of the lake via a sluice in the dam, forming a small ornamental waterfall at the Dell. The outflow has not historically maintained the waterfall, and re-circulation pumps were installed in the Dell, below the dam, to sustain this feature. The restoration work in 2012 restored the flows into the Serpentine and this waterfall is now restored as originally designed. Historically the river flowed due south from this point, marking the boundary between Westminster and Kensington, but since 1850 it has been diverted into a culvert, running underground to reach the Thames near Chelsea Bridge.|$|E
