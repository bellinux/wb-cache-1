25|$|A <b>cool</b> <b>box,</b> cooler, {{portable}} ice chest, chilly bin, or esky {{most commonly}} is an insulated box {{used to keep}} perishable food or beverages cool. Ice cubes, which are very cold, are most commonly placed in it to make the things inside stay cool. Ice packs are sometimes used, as they either contain the melting water inside, or have a gel sealed inside that also stays cold longer than plain water. The cooler was invented in 1951 by Richard C. Laramy of Joliet, Illinois. Laramy filed a patent for the cooler on February 24, 1951 and was issued U.S. patent #2,663,157 on December 22, 1953.|$|E

30|$|There was {{procurement}} of {{cold chain}} equipment and PPR vaccines {{as well as}} constitution of vaccination teams prior to vaccination campaigns. The cold chain equipment consisted of large-sized and medium-sized deep freezers, <b>cool</b> <b>boxes</b> and vaccine carriers. The freezers were solar powered and had provision for temperature regulation. The temperatures could be adjusted for storage of vaccine and serum sample as well as making ice blocks that {{were used for the}} <b>cool</b> <b>boxes.</b> In addition, approximately 20 million doses of freeze-dried live attenuated PPR vaccine strain Nigeria 75 / 1 strain were competitively procured from a Jordan Bio-Industries Center(JOVAC®) with support of FAO. This vaccine is certified by the African Union’s Pan African Veterinary Vaccine Centre (AU/PANVAC), the only organisation mandated to provide international independent quality control of veterinary vaccines used in African countries. The vaccines were delivered directly in Somalia after which they were inspected, before distribution for storage in the cold chain hubs. The vaccines were stored and transported at between +[*] 2 and +[*] 8  °C, from the hubs to the vaccination sites in <b>cool</b> <b>boxes</b> and vaccine carriers. The <b>cool</b> <b>boxes</b> and vaccine carriers were replenished with ice blocks every two to three days. The Livestock Professional Associations (LPAs), namely South West Livestock Professional Association (SOWELPA, Central Region Livestock Professional Association (CERELPA), Banadir Region Livestock Professional Association (BENALPA) and Ministries responsible for livestock in north-eastern and north-western zones, were also identified and contracted to conduct PPR vaccination campaigns based on technical expertise, past records of successful implementation of vaccination campaigns and operational presence.|$|R
40|$|The Portable Beverage Cooler (PBC) {{has been}} {{designed}} to satisfy the need of cooler apparatus that could be carried easily. The utilization of this apparatus was intended to minimize the environmental damage affected by vapour compression refrigeration system using CFCs Refrigerant. The peltier effect from thermoelectric module was utilized in this PBC and called as Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC). Furthermore, heat-sink and fan were needed to ensure the cooling effect continously worked. To achieved the objectives of this machine (portable, environment-friendly, low watt, affordable), the design consideration are heat load, insulating material, weight of components, electric consumption, and dimension of the <b>cooling</b> <b>box.</b> The results of the design shows the PBC <b>cooling</b> <b>box</b> dimension is 6 cm x 6. 5 x 15 cm. The insulation of the PBC <b>cooling</b> <b>box</b> are polyurethane foam and polystyrene expanded with thickness 6 mm and 5. 3 mm, respectively. The alumunium plate was applied as inner wall to enhance the cooling capacity of cooling room temperature. In this PBC was used one stage of TEC that could yield cooling room temperature until 15 oC in 30 minutes operation by consuming 20 W of electricity...|$|R

40|$|Evaporative cooling systems using a {{combination}} of evaporative pads and extractor fans require greenhouses to be hermetic. The greatest concentration of greenhouses in the world is located in southeast Spain, but these tend not to be hermetic structures and consequently can only rely on fogging systems as evaporative cooling techniques. Evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>boxes</b> provide an alternative to such systems. Using a low-speed wind tunnel, the present work has compared the performance of this system with four pads of differing geometry and thickness manufactured by two different companies. The results obtained show that the plastic packing in the cooling unit produces a pressure drop of 11. 05 Pa at 2 m·s− 1, which is between 51. 27 % and 94. 87 % lower than that produced by the cellulose pads. This pressure drop was not influenced by increases in the water flow. The evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>boxes</b> presented greater saturation efficiency at the same flow, namely 82. 63 %, as opposed to an average figure of 65 % for the cellulose pads; and also had a lower specific consumption of water, at around 3. 05 L·h− 1 ·m− 2 ·°C− 1. Consequently, we conclude that evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>boxes</b> are a good option for cooling non-hermetic greenhouses such as those most frequently used in the Mediterranean basin.
