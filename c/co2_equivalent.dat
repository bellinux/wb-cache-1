25|$|Even though Japan saw a fall in {{manufacturing}} output for 2011, {{there was an}} increased use of fossil fuels for power generation, {{and this was the}} main driving force behind a rise in Japanese greenhouse gas emissions.

Estimates vary on how many tons of greenhouse gases are emitted from thawed permafrost soils. One estimate suggests that 110-231 billion tons of <b>CO2</b> <b>equivalents</b> (about half from carbon dioxide and the other half from methane) will be emitted by 2040, and 850-1400 billion tons by 2100. This corresponds to an average annual emission rate of 4-8 billion tons of <b>CO2</b> <b>equivalents</b> in the period 2011-2040 and annually 10-16 billion tons of <b>CO2</b> <b>equivalents</b> in the period 2011-2100 as a result of thawing permafrost.

2500|$|In {{the case}} of the United States, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) {{conducted}} a study in 2012 to assess average greenhouse gas emissions resulting from charging plug-in car batteries {{from the perspective of the}} full life-cycle (well-to-wheel analysis) and according to fuel and technology used to generate electric power by region. The study used the Nissan Leaf all-electric car to establish the analysis baseline, and electric-utility emissions are based on EPA's 2007 estimates. The UCS study expressed the results in terms of miles per gallon instead of the conventional unit of grams of greenhouse gases or carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per year in order to make the results more friendly for consumers. The study found that in areas where electricity is generated from natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric or renewable sources, the potential of plug-in electric cars to reduce greenhouse emissions is significant. On the other hand, in regions where a high proportion of power is generated from coal, hybrid electric cars produce less <b>CO2</b> <b>equivalent</b> emissions than plug-in electric cars, and the best fuel efficient gasoline-powered subcompact car produces slightly less emissions than a PEV. In the worst-case scenario, the study estimated that for a region where all energy is generated from coal, a plug-in electric car would emit greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to a gasoline car rated at a combined city/highway driving fuel economy of [...] In contrast, in a region that is completely reliant on natural gas, the PEV would be equivalent to a gasoline-powered car rated at.|$|E

40|$|A field {{campaign}} was undertaken over a rice paddy in Central Taiwan {{to investigate the}} flux of CH(4) through the flux-gradient method. During the campaign period, the average observed concentrations of CH(4) during the campaign period at the lower height (22. 2 m above ground level, agl) and upper height (27. 5 m agl) were around 2. 04 ppm and 2. 01 ppm, respectively. It was noticed that the profile concentration of CH(4) was lower during day time when compared to night time. However, the flux of CH(4) was observed to be higher during the day time than during night hours. In {{order to understand the}} relationship between the influences of meteorological variables on the flux of CH(4), six meteorological variables were studied. It was observed that soil heat flux has a linear positive correlation with the flux of CH(4). During the study period, the maturity stage of rice paddy, the rice paddy ecosystem was behaving as sources of CH(4) and CO(2). Over a 100 -year time frame, the global warming potential (GWP) fluxes of CH(4) and CO(2) observed at this study site were 0. 16 and 0. 71 mu mol <b>CO(2)</b> <b>equivalents</b> m(- 2) s(- 1), respectively.

40|$|Methane (CH(4)) is an {{important}} greenhouse gas, contributing 0. 4 - 0. 5 W m(- 2) to global warming. Methane emissions originate from several sources, including wetlands, rice paddies, termites and ruminating animals. Previous measurements of methane flux from farm animals {{have been carried out}} on animals in unnatural conditions, in laboratory chambers or fitted with cumbersome masks. This study introduces eddy covariance measurements of CH(4), using the newly developed LI-COR LI- 7700 open-path methane analyser, to measure field-scale fluxes from sheep grazing freely on pasture. Under summer conditions, fluxes of methane in the morning averaged 30 nmol m (2) s (1), whereas those in the afternoon were above 100 nmol m(- 2) s(- 1), and were roughly two orders of magnitude larger than the small methane emissions from the soil. Methane emissions showed no clear relationship with air temperature or photo-synthetically active radiation, but some diurnal pattern was apparent, probably linked to sheep grazing behaviour and metabolism. Over the measurement period (days 60 - 277, year 2010), cumulative methane fluxes were 0. 34 mol CH(4) m(- 2), equating to 134. 3 g <b>CO(2)</b> <b>equivalents</b> m(- 2). By comparison, a carbon dioxide (CO(2)) sink of 819 g <b>CO(2)</b> <b>equivalents</b> m(- 2) was measured over the same period, but it is likely that much of this would be released back to the atmosphere during the winter or as off-site losses (through microbial and animal respiration). By dividing methane fluxes by the number of sheep in the field each day, we calculated CH(4) emissions per head of livestock as 7. 4 kg CH(4) sheep(- 1) yr(- 1), close to the published IPCC emission factor of 8 kg CH(4) sheep(- 1) yr(- 1) ...|$|R
