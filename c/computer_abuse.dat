40|$|While {{computer}} technology is generally intended to increase employee productivity and effectiveness that same {{computer technology}} {{may be used}} in negative ways that reduces productivity and increases cost in the business environment. <b>Computer</b> <b>abuse</b> has occurred in the past 12 months in {{more than half of the}} business environments surveyed by the Computer Security Institute. To date, research results still indicate that employee <b>computer</b> <b>abuse</b> is problematic and continues to significantly increase. It is estimated American businesses will lose 63 billion each year due to employees 2 ̆ 7 <b>computer</b> <b>abuse</b> on the Internet. This study was a predictive study that attempted to predict employees 2 ̆ 7 <b>computer</b> <b>abuse</b> intention (CAI) in the business environment based on the contribution of attitude (ATT), computer security policy awareness (CSPA), and computer self-efficacy (CSE). Working professionals from the south central United States were surveyed to determine their ATT toward <b>computer</b> <b>abuse,</b> CSPA, and CSE, as well as their intention to commit <b>computer</b> <b>abuse</b> in the business environment. A theoretical model was proposed, and two statistical methods were used to formulate models and test predictive power: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR). It was predicted that ATT, CSPA, and CSE will have a significant impact on employee 2 ̆ 7 s CAI. Results demonstrated that ATT was a significant predictor in predicting employee CAI on both the MLR and OLR regression models. CSE was a significant predictor on the MLR model only. CSPA was not found to be a significant predictor of CAI on either regression models. There are two main contributions of this study. First, to develop and empirically validate models for predicting employee 2 ̆ 7 s CAI in the business environment. Second, to investigate the most significant construct of the three constructs studied that contribute to the employee 2 ̆ 7 s CAI in the business environment...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{computer}} viruses {{have become increasingly}} significant {{as a form of}} <b>computer</b> <b>abuse.</b> By virtue of their reproductive capability, computer viruses can have cumulative and potentially catastrophic effects to the many people who use those affected computers. There is a growing concern in the computing community about these forms of electronic vandalism. This concern arises from the possible damage to stored information on which the work depends and the ensuing disruption of the work-place. Although the vandalism or purposeful abuse by introducing computer viruses to computer systems was originally mainly an American experience, research reports published by the Australian <b>Computer</b> <b>Abuse</b> Research Bureau (ACARB) support the claim that computer viruses have become increasingly significant as a form of <b>computer</b> <b>abuse</b> in Australia in recent years. Apart from ACARB 2 ̆ 7 s figures, there is minimal empirical research of a similar nature being conducted to investigate computer viruses as a form of <b>computer</b> <b>abuse</b> in Australia. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the problem, albeit on a limited scope. In this study, the infection types and rates of IBM PC viruses in limited government IT organizations in Western Australia were investigated.

40|$|There is {{currently}} a paucity of literature focusing {{on the relationship between}} the actual actions of staff members, who perpetrate some form of <b>computer</b> <b>abuse,</b> and the organisational environment in which such actions take place. A greater understanding of such a relationship may complement existing security practices by possibly highlighting new areas for safeguard implementation. In addition, if insights are afforded into the actions of dishonest staff, prior to the actual perpetration of a crime, then organisations may be able to expand their preventive scope, rather than relying solely on technical safeguards to stop the actual commission of some form of <b>computer</b> <b>abuse.</b> To help facilitate a greater understanding of the offender/environment dynamic, this paper assesses the feasibility of applying criminological theory to the IS security context. More specifically, three theories are advanced, which focus on the offender’s behaviour in a criminal setting. After opening with a description of the theories, the paper provides an account of the Barings Bank collapse. Events highlighted in the case study are used to assess whether concepts central to the theories are supported by the data. The paper concludes by summarising the major findings and discussing future research possibilities. 1...|$|E
40|$|The extant {{literature}} analyzing {{information system}} security policy violations has primarily focused on accidental or non-malicious noncompliance behavior. The focus is typically on the direct antecedents of behavioral intention, and researchers have applied theories related to planned behavior, adoption, protection motivation, and other cognitive processes. But another class of violation demands greater research emphasis [...] the intentional commission of {{computer security policy}} violation, or <b>computer</b> <b>abuse.</b> Whether motivated by greed, disgruntlement, or other psychological process, this act has the greatest potential for loss and damage to the employer. We argue the focus must include not only the act and its immediate antecedents, but also the cognitive processes leading {{to the formation of}} abuse intention, including the motivations and decision processes that may lead up to intention. By presenting three specific examples of how the organization can expand its zone of control further back in time ('to the left of bang'), our framework extends the Straub and Welke (1998) security action cycle. We present the Extended Security Action Cycle, a new theoretic model for illustrating potential organizational impacts on the formation of employees' intention to commit <b>computer</b> <b>abuse</b> within the organization. Implications for practitioners and academic researchers are presented, including guidelines for establishing trust with employees that will foster positive perceptions of organizational justice...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{academic}} {{investigations of}} {{computer security policy}} violations have largely focused on non-malicious noncompliance due to poor training, low employee motivation, weak affective commitment, or individual oversight. Established theoretical foundations applied to this domain have related to protection motivation, deterrence, planned behavior, self-efficacy, individual adoption factors, organizational commitment, and other individual cognitive factors. But another class of violation demands greater research emphasis: the intentional commission of computer security policy violation, or insider <b>computer</b> <b>abuse.</b> Whether motivated by greed, disgruntlement, or other psychological processes, this act has the greatest potential for loss and damage to the employer. We argue the focus must include not only the act and its immediate antecedents of intention (to commit <b>computer</b> <b>abuse)</b> and deterrence (of the crime), but also phenomena which temporally precede these areas. Specifically, we assert the {{need to consider the}} thought processes of the potential offender and how these are influenced by the organizational context, prior to deterrence. We believe the interplay between thought processes and this context may significantly impact the efficacy of IS security controls, specifically deterrence safeguards. Through this focus, we extend the Straub and Welke (1998) security action cycle framework and propose three areas worthy of empirical investigation—techniques of neutralization (rationalization), expressive/instrumental criminal motivations, and disgruntlement as a result of perceptions of organizational injustice—and propose questions for future research in these areas...|$|E
40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of E-Commerce activities and the Internet, computer crime has become a threat to economic growth and national security. Unfortunately, we have little understanding of the <b>computer</b> <b>abuse</b> problem because {{it is extremely difficult}} for outside researchers to have any direct access whatsoever to the sensitive research data for analysis. Underreporting is a major obstacle {{to our understanding of the}} <b>computer</b> <b>abuse</b> problem. The key research questions in this research study are:- (a) What are the differences between reported and unreported computer crimes? (b) Why are computer crimes underreported? (c) What is the process leading to the reporting and non-reporting of computer crimes? Previous research studies have suggested explanations for the underreporting problem of <b>computer</b> <b>abuse</b> incidents. However, these explanations only represent the victim's perspective through survey studies rather than the full facts of the case due to the unavailability of sensitive data. The unreported <b>computer</b> <b>abuse</b> incidents in the previous research are the "discovered, but unreported" cases where the victim discovers the crime, but fails to take action and report it. This research study has explored the underreporting problem of computer crimes by collecting data from multiple sources, e. g. the victim, the informant/witness, the perpetrator, the police investigator, and other stakeholders (banks and financial institutes, Internet service providers, etc.),through multiple means, e. g. interviews, participant observation, documents analysis, and undercover operations. The unreported computer crimes in the research include both the "discovered, but unreported" cases, and the "not discovered and unreported" cases in which the victims have no knowledge of the incidents. The purpose of this research is to understand why most victims do not report computer crimes and the process leading to the reporting and non-reporting decision by examining the differences between reported and unreported computer crime cases. The unit of analysis is the computer crime case. In qualitative research methodology, participant observation is used to identify the special characteristics or the affecting factors of the unreported and reported computer crime cases. The qualitative approach includes:- (i) direct observations on human behaviours, events and activities, (ii) interviews with victims, perpetrators, informants, witnesses, police investigators and other stakeholders, and (iii) document analysis of reports, memos, statements, case files and archived records. The findings from the participant observation can provide a fundamental framework for coding of the results for empirical study. The statistical techniques include the use of :- (i) contingency tables, (ii) comparing proportion differences, (iii) chi-squared test, (iv) confidence interval for difference of proportions, (v) odd ratio, (vi) correspondence analysis, (vii) principal component analysis and (viii) logistic regression. The empirical findings can provide an overall understanding of the differences between unreported and reported computer crimes and contribute knowledge to the underreporting problem. As an extension of this quantitative analysis approach, the research is then strengthened by examining four case studies in-depth. Two good cases that fit well with the logistic regression model and two bad cases that do not fit well with the logistic regression model are selected for case study. The case study findings have enriched the research outcomes with construct validity, content validity, external validity and reliability. The research results are extremely important and useful. Without a safe and secure environment, it will be difficult to establish trust in conducting E-Commerce between anonymous parties over the Internet. <b>Computer</b> <b>abuse</b> is a major threat to E-Commerce activities and the underreporting problem has hindered the efficacy of policy makers, law enforcement agencies, IT security professionals and corporate management in addressing the computer abuse/crime problem globally. The research findings have been analyzed using a spiral DIER (Discovery-Investigation-Escalation-Revelation) model for better understanding of the actions and responses of individuals and corporations regarding computer crime incidents. Subsequently, a workable strategy is also proposed to rectify the underreporting problem and enhance our knowledge of the computer crime problem...|$|E

The model includes profiles for representing the behavior of subjects with respect to objects in terms of metrics and statistical models, and rules for acquiring knowledge about this behavior from audit records and for detecting anomalous behavior. The model is independent of any particular system, application environment, system vulnerability, or type of intrusion, thereby providing a framework for a general-purpose intrusion-detection expert system...|$|E

40|$|Systems risk {{refers to}} the {{likelihood}} that an IS is inadequately guarded against certain types of damage or loss. While risks are posed by acts of God, hackers and viruses, consideration should also {{be given to the}} ‘insider’ threat of dishonest employees, intent on undertaking some form of <b>computer</b> <b>abuse.</b> Against this backdrop, a number of researchers have addressed the extent to which security managers are cognizant of the very nature of systems risk. In particular, they note how security practitioners’ knowledge of local threats, which form part of such risk, is often fragmented. This contributes to situations where risk reducing efforts are often less than effective. Security efforts are further complicated given that the task of managing systems risk requires input from a number of departments including, for example, HR, compliance, IS/IT and physical security. In a bid to complement existing research, but also offer a fresh perspective, this paper addresses systems risk from the offender’s perspective. If systems risk entails the likelihood that an IS is inadequately protected, this text considers those conditions, within the organisational context, which offer a criminal opportunity for the offender. To achieve this goal a model known as the ‘Crime Specific Opportunity Structure’ is advanced. Focussing on the opportunities for <b>computer</b> <b>abuse,</b> the model addresses the nature of such opportunities with regards to the organisational context and the threats posed by rogue employees. Drawing on a number of criminological theories, it is believed the model may help inform managers about local threats and, by so doing, enhance safeguard implementation. None...|$|E

The representation uses Allen's temporal interval algebra to describe the temporal relations between events caused by the user.
