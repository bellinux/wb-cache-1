25|$|These <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> bits {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to reamers as they have no cutting point or means of starting a hole. They have 3 or 4 flutes which enhances the finish of the hole and ensures the bit cuts evenly. <b>Core</b> <b>drill</b> bits differ from reamers {{in the amount of}} material they are intended to remove. A reamer is only intended to enlarge a hole a slight amount which, depending on the reamers size, may be anything from 0.1 millimeter to perhaps a millimeter. A <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> bit may be used to double the size of a hole.|$|E

25|$|Icebreaker Life is a lander {{mission that}} {{proposed}} for NASA's Discovery Program for the 2021 launch opportunity, {{but it was}} not selected for development. It would have had a stationary lander that would be a near copy of the successful 2008 Phoenix and it would have carried an upgraded astrobiology scientific payload, including a 1-meter-long <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> to sample ice-cemented ground in the northern plains to conduct a search for organic molecules and evidence of current or past life on Mars. One of the key goals of the Icebreaker Life mission is to test the hypothesis that the ice-rich ground in the polar regions has significant concentrations of organics due to protection by the ice from oxidants and radiation.|$|E
50|$|The HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> with Hard Coating are <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> with a coating on it, {{generally}} TiN Coating. This {{make the}} <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{more resistant to}} heat, longer tool life and even removal of chips. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are gaining lot of popularity over the Standard HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> these days. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are used Structural steel, Stainless steel, etc.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Core</b> <b>drills</b> used {{in metal}} are called annular cutters. <b>Core</b> <b>drills</b> used for {{concrete}} are generally called Diamond <b>Core</b> <b>Drills</b> and are water cooled. [...] For <b>drilling</b> masonry, carbide <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> can be used.|$|R
50|$|The HSS Cobalt are <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{made from}} M42 Steel. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> have 8% Cobalt in HSS. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are {{harder than the}} Standard HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> which gives better {{performance}} to drill harder material. A high percentage of Cobalt in HSS makes it faster, stronger and durable. Cobalt HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are used to drill materials like Structural Steel, Stainless Steel, Cast iron, etc.|$|R
2500|$|A bit used {{to enlarge}} an {{existing}} hole {{is called a}} <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> bit. The existing hole {{may be the result}} of a core from a casting or a stamped (punched) hole. [...] The name comes from its first use, for drilling out the hole left by a foundry core, a cylinder placed in a mould for a casting that leaves an irregular hole in the product. This <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> bit is solid.|$|E
2500|$|A hollow {{cylindrical}} bit which will cut a hole with an annular cross-section {{and leave the}} inner cylinder of material (the [...] "core") intact, often removing it, is also called a <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> bit or annular cutter. Unlike other drills, the purpose is often to retrieve the core rather than simply to make a hole. A diamond <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> bit is intended to cut an annular hole in the workpiece. Large bits of similar shape are used for geological work, where a deep hole is drilled in sediment or ice and the drill bit, which now contains an intact core of the material drilled with a diameter of several centimeters, is retrieved to allow study of the strata.|$|E

50|$|The HSS Standard <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are made}} from M2 steel. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are one of the}} most popular <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> in western {{countries}} due to its cost and resharpening advantage. The Standard HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are used to drill Mild and Structural steel, Aluminium, Stainless steel of lower BHN., etc.|$|R
50|$|HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are cheaper}} than the TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> for smaller diameters up to 40 mm, while TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are cheaper than HSS for diameters above 41 mm.|$|R

2500|$|ExoMars is a European-led multi-spacecraft {{programme}} {{currently under}} development by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian Federal Space Agency for launch in 2016 and 2020. Its primary scientific mission {{will be to}} search for possible biosignatures on Mars, past or present. A rover with a [...] <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> {{will be used to}} sample various depths beneath the surface where liquid water may be found and where microorganisms (or organic biosignatures) might survive cosmic radiation.|$|E
2500|$|This drill {{team was}} the first to reach the trapped miners with an escape shaft. Plan B {{involved}} a Schramm Inc. T130XD air <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> owned by Geotec S.A. (a Chilean-American joint venture drilling company) that was chosen by Drillers Supply SA (the general contractor of Plan B) to widen one of the three 5.5inches (14cm) boreholes that were already keeping the miners supplied with palomas. Normally, the drills are used to drill top holes for {{the oil and gas industry}} and for mineral exploration and water wells. This system employed Chilean Drillers Supply SA (DSI) personnel, Mijali Proestakis G.M. and Partner, Igor Proestakis Tech Mgr, Greg Hall C.E.O. (who joined his team on site for the last eight days of drilling) and their 7" [...] drill pipe air <b>core</b> <b>drill,</b> a team of American drillers from Layne Christensen Company and specialized Down-The-Hole drilling hammers from Center Rock, Inc., of Berlin, Pennsylvania. Center Rock's president and personnel from DSI Chile were present on-site for the 33 days of drilling. While the Schramm rig, built by privately held Schramm, Inc. of West Chester, Pennsylvania, was already on the ground in Chile at the time of the mine collapse, additional drilling equipment was flown from the United States to Chile by United Parcel Service. The percussion-technology hammer drill can drill at more than [...] a day by using four hammers instead of one.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOn {{the request}} of the current level of the {{geological}} <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> design, refer to oil drilling design software, a geological <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> computer aided design system was developed by means of advanced web design technology. The system covers all procedures of geological <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> design, and presets reference value according to system database information, and automatically draws geological column and borehole columnar section according to the user design information, and finally produces overall and standard design report. The development technology is based on ZK and Hibernate framework with MVC and MVVM model. Consequently, the system will be easy to be used and maintained, and will contribute to the geological <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> design information exchange and share online...|$|R
50|$|TCT cutter biggest {{advantage}} is speed and ease {{in which it}} may cut harder materials. Especially for larger diameter TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are very successful. While HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are good when drilling not very hard material and for small diameter hole sizes.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{were those}} used by the ancient Egyptians, invented in 3000 BC. <b>Core</b> <b>drills</b> are used for many applications, either where the core needs to be preserved (the drilling apparatus used in obtaining a core sample {{is often referred to}} as a corer), or where drilling can be done more rapidly since much less material needs to be removed than with a standard bit. This is the reason that diamond-tipped <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are commonly used in construction to create holes for pipes, manholes, and other large-diameter penetrations in concrete or stone.|$|R
50|$|The biggest {{disadvantage}} of <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> or annular cutter {{is that it}} can not drill blind holes. A <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> due to its hollow geometry can only make through holes. Another disadvantage is in drilling a pile of many plates. There are some core drills with a different geometry which can be used for drilling piles of plates, but still it is not 100% successful. The cost of a <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is high compared to twist drill, but the cost per hole made with <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is less as compared to twist drills, this is because a single <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> makes 5 to 10 times more holes than a twist drill.|$|E
50|$|As <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> has to cut less {{material}} {{as compared to}} twist drill, the time required is also too less. A <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> {{is considered to be}} 3 to 4 times faster than twist drills.|$|E
50|$|The {{chances of}} defect in TCT core drills is more because the {{tungsten}} carbide tips are glued on the <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> {{and when the}} <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> falls down or crashes on the material, the chances tip breakage is more. HSS cutter {{on the other hand}} are completely made out of one material.|$|E
