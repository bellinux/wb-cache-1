40|$|Birds should store body {{reserves}} if starvation risk is anticipated; this {{is known}} as an ‘interrupted foraging response’. If foraging remains unrestricted, however, body mass should remain low to limit the predation risk that gaining and carrying body reserves entails. In temperate environments mass gain in female birds during breeding is often attributed to egg formation and mass loss after incubation to flight adaptation or the effect of reproductive workload, rather than {{as a result of an}} adaptive interrupted foraging response to the limited foraging time or unpredictable foraging conditions that breeding demands. In tropical environments, foraging conditions vary more within the breeding season than in temperate environments, and so studies in tropical environments are more suited to decouple the potentially confounded effects of increase in body reserves versus egg formation on the body mass of breeding birds. In this study, we test whether breeding results in an interrupted foraging response in a tropical savannah system using body mass data collected over a 15 -year period from female <b>Common</b> <b>Bulbuls</b> Pycnonotus barbatus. This species breeds both in the wet and dry season, despite fewer resources being available in the dry season. Breeding stage predicted female body mass: body mass peaked abruptly during incubation, but was not closely associated with the egg-laying stage, and declined during brood rearing. Breeding females were heavier in the dry season than in the wet season. In the dry season, heavier birds were more likely to incubate eggs or brood chicks. These observations suggest that increased body reserves are required to buffer the consequence of limited foraging time or impoverished foraging conditions, which may be most pronounced during incubation and in the dry season, respectively. Such mass increases are consistent with an interrupted foraging response, which may apply to temperate zone birds experiencing foraging restrictions during breeding...|$|R

2500|$|The {{terrestrial}} aviary {{was opened}} in 1992, but was closed {{within a few}} years due to maintenance issues. It was renovated and reopened in 2010 as the Bio Centre. This [...] walk-through aviary cost about [...] 2 million and is located on a slope behind the tiger house (...) [...] The aviary is the biggest such facility in a zoo in the country. The facility features fifteen-metre-tall fences to facilitate free flight of birds within the area. The aviary is home to about 245 birds of different species including Alexandrine parakeet, rose-ringed parakeet, blue rock pigeon, common myna, Indian koel, <b>common</b> babbler, white-browed <b>bulbul,</b> francolin, red-vented bulbul, red-whiskered bulbul, wagtail, pipit, orange-headed thrush, red-wattled lapwing, little brown dove and spotted dove. The height of the aviary ranges from [...] {{at the top of the}} slope to [...] at the bottom, with the chain link 'roof' sloping downward from west to east. The aviary is surrounded by a [...] wall, and the four sides above this are covered with steel and blue-coloured nylon net in order to provide an open-sky effect. The ground is floored by tiled footpath lawned with Korean grass to maintain the humidity level. The moist deciduous habitat supports 22 tree and shrub species. Fruit-bearing trees such as mango, pomegranate, guava, sapota (Sapodilla), jamoon, Singapore cherry and chillies have been planted for the benefit of fruit-eating birds. Heaps of dry leaves, dung, dry wood waste and rotten fruits have been provided for insect-eating birds. The zoo has also set up a mud bath facility for the birds. Palm trees with holes have been planted to facilitate natural breeding of parakeets, and heaps of stones have been provided for ground-nesting birds. The aviary also has fountains and water bodies for the birds.|$|R

40|$|This {{report by}} the Slovenian Rarities Committee {{presents}} records of rare bird species in Slovenia in 2013, with some addenda for previous years. The numbers in brackets refer {{to the number of}} records (first number) and individuals (second number), recorded between 1 Jan 1950 and 31 Dec 2012. Since 1 Jan 2013, submission to the Committee is required for 37 additional species, 17 of which are regional rarities. Records of these species are not numbered, since records from previous years were not collected by the Committee. Four new species were recorded in category A: White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala, Baillon’s Crake Porzana pusilla, Audouin’s Gull Larus audouinii and Siberian Rubythroat Calliope calliope. Three species, Helmeted Guineafowl Numida meleagris, Chukar Alectoris chukar and <b>Common</b> <b>Bulbul</b> Pycnonotus barbatus, were added to category E. Other notable observations were the second and third records of Bewick’s Swan Cygnus columbianus and fourth record of Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus. The list of birds recorded in Slovenia (as of 31 Dec 2013) contains 384 species (369 in category A, 7 in category B, 8 exclusively in category C; 4 species are both in categories A and C). Category D contains 6 species, while category E contains 33. These two categories {{are not part of the}} lis...|$|E
40|$|The area of {{land farmed}} in Africa is {{predicted}} to double by the year 2050 yet very few African studies have investigated the impact of different farming intensities and regimes on bird communities. This study examined avian species richness and diversity along with the densities of some common bird species on the Jos Plateau, Nigeria, in relation to habitat features on farmland over a gradient of differing farming intensities. The study area exhibited {{a variety of different}} levels of farming which differed in the habitat available for birds. Birds normally associated with savanna woodland were more associated with less intensive farming, and open-country birds were more associated with more intensive sites, with more species of birds observed where farming was less intensive. Common species of birds using cultivated land associated with different crops, with acha and millet being the most commonly used. Tree density was the most important variable predicting avian species richness and diversity, with medium tree density predicting the highest species richness and diversity. The densities of two common farmland birds were predicted best by tree density, but varied in their responses to the habitat variables, with <b>common</b> <b>bulbul,</b> a savanna generalist, associating more with less intensive, wooded areas and red-cheeked cordon-bleu, an open savanna granivore, associating with medium intensity, more open farmland. Whinchats were common in open, intensively farmed areas with few trees and good herbaceous vegetation cover. The data presented indicates the importance of retaining natural features of savanna habitat in farmland in order to maintain high avian diversity on farmland. More detailed studies are needed {{in order to determine the}} mechanisms involved in the associations observed and collaborations between ecologists and social scientists will be necessary to develop effective policies to limit the impact of the intensification of agriculture in Africa on avian biodiversity.
