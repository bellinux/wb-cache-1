40|$|Abstract: The {{density of}} the <b>coal</b> <b>charge</b> plays an {{important}} role in the coke quality. The increase of the bulk density usually improves the coke strength due to increased coal particle contact and increased coke density. There are a few possibilities to increase the <b>coal</b> <b>charge</b> bulk density: adjusting the grain size distribution or moisture content (drying), oil addition and mechanical treatment (e. g., partial briquetting or stamping). A renewed interest in stamp charging cokemaking technology has been observed in recent years, especially in Asia, but also in Europe (Poland, Germany and Ukraine). The paper presents the results of studies on the effects of selected factors on the coal cake density and mechanical strength i. e. stamping energy, coal type, water content and crushing fineness. There is possibility to influence these parameters in industrial conditions. The investigations were carried out with use of mechanical stamping apparatus and strength testing machine specially designed for this purpose...|$|E

30|$|Coke is {{produced}} by heating finely crushed <b>coal</b> <b>charge</b> in air tight coke ovens. The <b>coal</b> <b>charge</b> mostly consists of blends of different coking coals {{and in some cases}} also partially briquetted charge coal. After carbonization, the coke is pushed from the ovens and quenched with water/inert gas (dry quenching). This hard and porous carbonaceous product acts mainly as a source of reductant for the reduction of iron ore, provides thermal energy and provides a permeable support for the burden materials in the blast furnace. Although coke is expensive, it is still indispensable for the production of liquid iron through Blast Furnace (BF) route. The Major functions of coke in BF are to provide heat for different endothermic reactions inside the BF and for melting of slag and metal, reducing gases required for the reduction of iron oxides, support and permeable bed during counter current flow of materials and gases in BF. Coke is the only solid material in the furnace that supports the iron bearing burden and provides a permeable bed necessary for slag and metal to pass down into the hearth and for hot gases to pass upwards in BF. Of the above mentioned three roles of BF coke, the first two can be substituted by oil, gas, plastics and non-coking coals. These are injected through tuyeres to generate heat and reducing gases. Such a substitution brings reduction in coke rates for the blast furnace (coke rate is the weight of coke required to produce one tonne of hot metal). However, there is no other satisfactory material available, which can replace, fully or partially, metallurgical coke as a permeable support of blast furnace charge materials (burden). Over the last few decades, coke quality requirements have become more stringent due to development of large capacity blast furnaces (>[*] 3500  m 3) and high pulverized coal injection (PCI)/coal dust injection (CDI) rates.|$|E

The nature of the <b>coal</b> <b>charge</b> is obviously a major factor in determining the coke structure and in general, low rank high volatile coals with sufficient fluidity to ensure that all components are fused together tend to produce high porosity cokes.|$|E

After the stone paving had been laid, several 70 -mesh steel wire meshes were placed on the stone layer. The stable stone pad forms the structure of the gas-charging base. The prepared coal is placed into a primary box and tamped. Pressure, stress and temperature sensors were placed in the coal sample at different layers and locations.

30|$|The {{quality of}} coke affects the {{performance}} of the blast furnace, factors affecting coke quality include coal properties, <b>coal</b> <b>charge</b> granulometry and carbonization conditions. The coke properties include the size analysis, cold strength (Micum Indices-M 40, M 10) and hot strength (Coke Reactivity Index-CRI, Coke Strength after Reaction-CSR) properties and structural properties such as coke structure and texture. Structural properties comprise the porosity, pore-cell wall thickness and pore sizes, while textures consist of the carbon forms in the coke. In present work, advanced method such as image analysis method was used to interpret coke microstructure. Conventional methods such as determination of coke porosity by measurement of real and apparent density and mercury porosimetry have a number of limitations. Coke size, magnification, number of image frames captured, process of pellet preparations and coke properties such as M 40, M 10, CRI and CSR (low, medium and high values) were taken as variables for experimental purposes. The coke structure parameters such as porosity, length, perimeter, breadth, roundness, pore-wall thickness and pore size distribution of the pores were determined by image analysis method. This method provided average porosity in addition to pore-wall thickness and pore-size distribution. The pore wall thickness measurement by image analysis method provided significant correlations with M 40, CRI and CSR values. This explained the usability of image analysis for coke structure measurement.|$|E
40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The carbonization of some low volatile matter coals {{for the production of}} metallurgical coke in slot type ovens is accompanied by the exertion of pressures on the walls which can be dangerous and destroy the walls. It is generally accepted that coking pressure originates from the volatile matter released from the coal being retained as pressurized vapours trapped within the plastic layer of the carbonizing <b>coal</b> <b>charge.</b> Pressure during carbonization also influences the nature of the carbon texture and the porous structure of coke is strongly dependent on volatile matter release during the plastic stage of the carbonization process. There is therefore a possible association of coking pressure, coke porous structure and coke carbon texture. Seven coals giving a variety of wall pressures, as measured in a movable-wall oven,ranging from safe to dangerously coking, were carbonized in a small laboratory oven. The textural compositions of the resultant cokes were assessed by polarized light microscopy while pore structural parameters were measured by computerized image analysis. The textural compositions varied with volatile matter content of the coals while the porosities varied linearly with the internal gas pressures measured in a single plastic layer. In an attempt to investigate possible relations between the pore structure development and internal gas pressures generated in a single plastic layer, polished surfaces showing the coal-to-coke transformation were prepared after quenching carbonized single-wall oven charges. These surfaces were studied by image analysis techniques to obtain measurements of the pore sizes as carbonization proceeded. Pore sizes generally rose to a maximum within the plastic temperature range before falling to the almost constant value seen in the semicoke. No systematic variation between the pore structure development and the internal gas pressures could be established...|$|E
