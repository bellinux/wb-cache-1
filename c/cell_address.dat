30|$|An other issue, {{which can}} create routing holes, is {{localization}} errors in real deployments. The hexagonal tessellation and our geographic forwarding protocol rely on each node {{being able to}} estimate its own coordinates. These estimates are highly likely affected by a non-negligible error, which in turn affects the calculated cell addressing [H, I] used for packet forwarding. We use a kind of polar coordinate system to address {{the cells of the}} tessellation. This addressing scheme serves as a positioning (coordinate) system that is rougher than the coordinates of the sensor nodes, with a precision appropriate for the transition range. A localization estimate with a reasonable error err < r, where r is the edge length of a hexagonal cell, will result in the same <b>cell</b> <b>address</b> [H, I]. Therefore, the packet forwarding mechanism will not be affected by the localization errors. If a given node, which is close to the boundary of its hexagonal cell, calculates a wrong <b>cell</b> <b>address</b> due to localization error, the erroneous <b>cell</b> <b>address</b> {{will be one of the}} neighbor cells of its real cell.

40|$|Abstract- Modeling 3 -D {{objects as}} octrees has {{demonstrated}} considerable advantages {{which led to}} numerous applications in robotics where free space localization is critical. Efficient neighbor finding techniques in tree structures are required for such models to be used properly, especially for path planning and collision avoidance. In this paper, an optimized neighbor finding approach is presented {{that is based on}} a recursive addressing scheme which precludes any backtracking into the tree structure while preserving model compactness. Neighboring cell addresses are computed directly given a displacement direction in 3 -D space and the address of the starting cell. Neighboring rule sets that have been previously derived for a quadtree representation are now extended to octrees. Given the algebraic rules that are defined, computation of a neighboring <b>cell</b> <b>address</b> in an octree comes down to basic arithmetic operations with carry.

40|$|Abstract. Implementations of Software Transactional Memory (STM) {{algorithms}} associate metadata {{with the}} memory locations accessed dur-ing a transaction’s lifetime. This metadata may be stored either in-place, by wrapping every memory cell in a container that includes the memory cell itself and the corresponding metadata; or out-place (also called ex-ternal), by resorting to a mapping function that associates the memory <b>cell</b> <b>address</b> with an external table entry containing the corresponding metadata. The implementation techniques for these two approaches are very different and each STM framework is usually biased towards one of them, only allowing the efficient implementation of STM algorithms following that approach, hence inhibiting the fair comparison with STM algorithms falling into the other. In this paper we introduce a technique to implement in-place metadata that does not wrap memory cells, thus overcoming the bias by allowing STM algorithms to directly access the transactional metadata. The proposed technique is available as an ex-tension to the DeuceSTM framework, and enables the efficient imple-mentation {{of a wide range}} of STM algorithms and their fair (unbiased) comparison in a common STM infrastructure. We illustrate the benefits of our approach by analyzing its impact in two popular TM algorithms with two different transactional workloads, TL 2 and multi-versioning, with bias to out-place and in-place respectively. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to stress, intracellular signaling proteins activate gene expression programs that protect the <b>cell,</b> <b>address</b> the instigating stress, or result in programmed cell death. In many cases, {{information about the}} stimulus is encoded in {{the dynamics of the}} signal. Stress-induced signaling dynamics can therefore dictate the cellular {{response to}} stress. Recently, it was shown that these dynamics are affected by the resting state of the cell prior to stimulation. If this relationship between steady state and stimulus-induced dynamics was known, then we might predict the cellular response to a particular stimulus using steady state measurements, or engineer a stimulus to elicit a desired response. These are the foundations of diagnostic biomarkers and personalized medicine. To characterize the relationship between steady state and the cellular response, I developed a suite of computational methods and applied them to the p 53, NF- [kappa]B, and cell death pathways. First, I developed a method to derive analytical expressions for the steady states of mass action models. By applying this method to a model of cell death, I show how the steady state concentrations of different signaling proteins can affect the tolerance to the death-inducing ligand, TRAIL. Next I extended this method to examine perturbations in the steady state that don't affect the steady state protein concentrations. Applying this method to the p 53 and NF- [kappa]B stress-response pathways, I show that a protein turnover signaling motif controls the stimulus-sensitivity of these two different pathways. Finally, using a Monte Carlo method, I show how sampling of the steady state prior to simulation can identify steady state predictors of the response to TRAIL. Interestingly, kinetic features, rather than steady state concentrations, figured prominently among the best predictors. If true, this has severe consequences for clinical biomarker discovery, which is based on measurements of protein abundance and not kinetic feature...|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} the {{hepatitis}} B surface antigen (HBsAg) {{as a tool to}} explore mechanisms by which polarized epithelial <b>cells</b> <b>address</b> specific proteins to their apical domain. It recently has been proposed that N-glycans can serve as apical signals recognized by lectin-like sorting receptors in the trans-Golgi network. We found, however, conclusive evidence that the HBsAg follows an apical pathway not mediated by N-glycan signaling. Neither tunicamycin treatment nor replacement of its single glycosylated residue, Asn- 146, altered its predominant (> 85 %) apical secretion from transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Although HBsAg is known to be secreted as a lipoprotein particle, our results suggest that the exocytic machinery involved in its N-glycan-independent pathway overlaps, at least partially, with that of other apically targeted proteins, including the endogenous gp 80, as judged by the effects of brefeldin A. We also tested whether its sorting behavior could be ascribed to association with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored proteins, which, together with glycosphingolipids, primarily are targeted to the apical domain of MDCK cells. HBsAg was preferentially secreted from the apices of transfected Fisher rat thyroid cells, which, in contrast to MDCK <b>cells,</b> <b>address</b> GPI-proteins and glycosphingolipids to their basal domain. Moreover, complete inhibition of GPI biogenesis by mannosamine treatment did not impair the HBsAg apical secretion, discarding the possibility that HBsAg could be “hitchhiking” with a newly synthesized GPI-protein. Thus, the HBsAg provides a unique model system to search for yet-unknown apical sorting mechanisms that could depend on proteinaceous targeting signals interacting with cognate trans-Golgi network receptors that are at present unidentified...|$|R
