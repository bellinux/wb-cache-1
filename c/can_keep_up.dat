500|$|The Huffington Posts Laura Prudom {{applauded the}} {{differences}} between the characters in Storybrooke and their fairytale counterparts; she felt that this narrative device would help prevent viewers from getting frustrated if Snow and Charming grew further apart in one land but closer in the other. Prudom also enjoyed the writers' decision to make David [...] "indecisive and, as a result, also somewhat selfish," [...] while James is ready to leave his fiance for Snow. Prudom concluded that the episode [...] "expertly combined all the elements that make Once Upon a Time one of the most addictive and heartfelt new shows of the season, blending emotion, mystery and narrative thrust while giving us a deeper understanding of our favorite characters. I hope the next batch of episodes <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> the momentum established this week." ...|$|E

[...] Writing for the Star-Ledger, Jenifer Braun praised the episode for its set dressing ("I have to say, it’s a pleasure {{just to look at}} all the shiny stuff the HBO set dressers came up with for Tywin Lannister's tent") and the authenticity of the baby dragons ("And wow, HBO, seamless special effects here. Baby Dragon looks every bit as real as the series’ dogs"). HitFix said it [...] "Wrapped up its terrific first season...it was damned entertaining along the way--with the finale as possibly the most entertaining so far--and we know that at least one more season is coming. And if the creative team <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> this level of quality, it's hard to imagine HBO shutting things down anytime soon, even with a budget that only figures to get higher. Dragons aren't cheap, but they're also amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E

[...] Former Boston Bruins legend Ray Bourque once said, [...] "Sergei is a dominating player, a franchise player.

[...] Steve Yzerman and Wayne Gretzky speaking to Fox Sports columnist and Detroit radio host Art Regner in past interviews said they thought [...] "Fedorov is the most talented player they've ever seen." [...] After leaving the Red Wings (his first season with Anaheim, in which he scored 31 times), Fedorov had multiple injuries and his tally of 18 goals in 2006-07 was the most he scored until his retirement from the NHL in 2008-09.|$|E

2500|$|DNA {{molecules}} in eukaryotes {{differ from the}} circular molecules of prokaryotes {{in that they are}} larger and usually have multiple origins of replication. This means that each eukaryotic chromosome is composed of many replicating units of DNA with multiple origins of replication. In comparison, the prokaryotic E. coli chromosome has only a single origin of replication. In eukaryotes, these replicating forks, which are numerous all along the DNA, form [...] "bubbles" [...] in the DNA during replication. The replication fork forms at a specific point called autonomously replicating sequences (ARS). Eukaryotes have a clamp loader complex and a six-unit clamp called the proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The efficient movement of the replication fork also relies critically on the rapid placement of sliding clamps at newly primed sites on the lagging DNA strand by ATP-dependent clamp loader complexes. This means that the piecewise generation of Okazaki fragments <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the continuous synthesis of DNA on the leading strand. [...] These clamp loader complexes are characteristic of all eukaryotes and separate some of the minor differences in the synthesis of Okazaki fragments in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.|$|E

He said, [...] "While Kat shines in Redwater, it's {{fair to say that}} Alfie seems a little bit lost and directionless in {{the first episode}}, with even scenes of him {{experiencing}} weird visions and nearly dying (twice!) seeming like time-fillers." [...] He said the characters of Agnes and Dermott had [...] "immediately caught our attention" [...] but wondered if the show would appeal to viewers who are not EastEnders fans, saying [...] "surely you have to be an EastEnders watcher to really care about Kat's quest for her son?" [...] but said [...] "for us it's a thumbs up if Redwater <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> the suspense, surprises, gothic tone and sense of foreboding that sets it apart from EastEnders." [...] The series was reviewed on BBC Radio 5 Live's Afternoon Edition, where TV critic Emma Bullimore from TV Times said that it was [...] "enjoyable" [...] but more [...] "soapy" [...] and less [...] "complex" [...] than Broadchurch, and said that viewers should not expect it to be like EastEnders or Broadchurch but should [...] "accept it as a new thing", adding that it had good production values and deemed it a [...] "worthy experiment". Sinéad Garvan from Newsbeat, speaking at the same time, said that she found it [...] "weird" [...] seeing Kat and Alfie in a different setting and was more intrigued by the new characters but said that that Kat and Alfie still had the same chemistry that they have in EastEnders.|$|E
