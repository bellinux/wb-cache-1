40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} a construct of an application software designed to support laboratory test equipment for pyrolysis/coking process test equipment for the use at the Process Metallurgy Group (PMG) in the University of Oulu.

40|$|Catalytic {{techniques}} for processing waste products onboard space vehicles were evaluated. The {{goal of the}} study was the conversion of waste to carbon, wash water, oxygen and nitrogen. However, the ultimate goal is conversion to plant nutrients and other materials useful in closure of an ecological life support system for extended planetary missions. The resulting process studied involves hydrolysis at 250 C and 600 psia to break down and compact cellulose material, distillation at 100 C to remove water, coking at 450 C and atmospheric pressure, and catalytic oxidation at 450 to 600 C and atmospheric pressure. Tests were conducted with a model waste to characterize the hydrolysis and <b>coking</b> <b>processes.</b> An oxidizer reactor was sized based on automotive catalytic conversion experience. Products obtained from the hydrolysis and coking steps included a solid residue, gases, water condensate streams, and a volatile coker oil. Based on the data obtained, sufficient component sizing was performed to make a preliminary comparison of the catalytic technique with oxidation for processing waste for a six-man spacecraft. Wet oxidation seems to be the preferred technique from the standpoint of both component simplicity and power consumption...|$|R
40|$|Thermal related {{processes}} are {{widely recognized as}} the main sources of formation and emission of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). It is well known that, carbonization of coal in coke production involves many thermal reactions at high-temperature. However, there are still no strong evidences to identify <b>coking</b> <b>processes</b> as source of PCDD/Fs and PCBs. In this study, coke production was qualified and quantified for emission of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) in some typical coke plants in China. In the preliminary investigation, stack gases from three typical coke plants were collected, and dl-PCBs and 2378 -substituted PCDD/Fs were analyzed by isotope dilution HRGC/HRMS technique. The total toxic equivalents of dl-PCBs and PCDD/Fs were {{in the range of}} 1. 6 - 1785. 4 pg WHC-TEQ Nm(- 3). For dl-PCBs, the most abundant congener was CB- 118, and the most dominant contributor to total WHO-TEQ of dl-PCBs was CB- 126. With regard to PCDD/Fs, four congeners comprised of OCDD, 1234678 -HpCDD, 1234678 -HpCDF and OCDF were the predominant species in stack gases. Further investigation on the emission of dioxins from coking industry is still in process. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{pollution}} {{of the lower}} river, the upper reaches retained a population of fish. Brown trout were present around Stainsby, and there were small numbers of coarse fish, which had originated in the lakes at Hardwick Hall. They could not exist further down river, because of {{the pollution}}. Part {{of the problem was}} caused by efforts to reduce air pollution, which resulted in the production of smokeless fuels. While this reduced smoke from domestic fires, the liquors which were removed from the coal were highly toxic and rich in ammonia. The coking plant at Bolsover run by Coalite Chemicals was a significant producer of pollution, and the site was also producing chlorinated compounds by distilling the liquors resulting from the <b>coking</b> <b>process,</b> which added to the toxic mix.

40|$|The {{thermochemical}} conversion process of solid fuels is explicitly shown as {{the processes of}} pyrolysis (including coking and carbonization), gasification, and combustion. These processes actually involve a similar complex reaction network. The so-called "decoupling" refers to the optimization approach of process performance through controlling the interactions between or among the involved individual reactions. Our previous article in Energy & Fuels (2010, 24, 6223 - 6232) has analyzed how the approach of decoupling applies to the gasification technologies and justified the realized effects from decoupling. This successive report is devoted to understanding the applications of decoupling to the other types of {{thermochemical conversion}} technologies (mainly including pyrolysis and combustion) so as to generalize the "decoupling" methodology for innovations of thermochemical conversion technologies. After a reiteration of the principle and implementation approaches (isolating and staging) for decoupling reanalysis of the process design principle and its consequent technical superiorities based on decoupling is performed for a few well-known or emerging novel conversion technologies developed in the world. The concrete technologies exemplified and their realized beneficial effects include the high-efficiency advanced coal <b>coking</b> <b>processes</b> with moisture control or gentle pyrolysis of feedstock in advance, coal pyrolysis in multiple countercurrent reactors for producing high-quality tar, gasification of caking coal in fluidized bed through adopting jetting preoxidation of coal, low-NOx decoupling combustion of coal by developing the in bed NOx reduction capabilities of pyrolysis gas and char, and coal topping combustion for the coproduction of tar and heat. These highlights further justified that the decoupling would be a viable technical choice for achieving {{one or more of}} the technical advantages among polygeneration, high efficiency, high product quality, wide fuel adaptability, low pollutant emissions in thermochernical conversions of solid carbonaceou...|$|R
