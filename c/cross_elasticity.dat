50|$|In economics, the <b>cross</b> <b>{{elasticity}}</b> {{of demand}} or cross-price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded {{for a good}} {{to a change in}} the price of another good, ceteris paribus. It is measured as the percentage change in quantity demanded for the first good that occurs in response to a percentage change in price of the second good. For example, if, in response to a 10% increase in the price of fuel, the demand for new cars that are fuel inefficient decreased by 20%, the <b>cross</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand would be:. A negative <b>cross</b> <b>elasticity</b> denotes two products that are complements, while a positive <b>cross</b> <b>elasticity</b> denotes two substitute products. Assume products A and B are complements, meaning that an increase in the demand for A accompanies an increase in the quantity demanded for B. Therefore, if the price of product B decreases, the demand curve for product A shifts to the right reflecting an increase in A's demand, resulting in a negative value for the <b>cross</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand. The exact opposite reasoning holds for substitutes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cross</b> price <b>elasticities</b> are {{important}} to market researchers and managers seeking to understand the differential levels of competition among multiple brands in a category. Elasticities provide two types of information. From a strategic perspective, <b>cross</b> price <b>elasticities</b> provide insights into the market structure of the product category. From a tactical perspective, <b>cross</b> price <b>elasticities</b> help managers quantify the impact of price promotions on competing products. Obtaining managerially useful <b>cross</b> price <b>elasticities</b> from store-level scanner data is a challenging task (Cooper 1988; Montgomery 1997; Wedel and Zhang 2004). Statistical problems such as multicollinearity often result in cross price effects of unreasonable magnitude or unreasonable sign. Significant progress in elasticity estimation has been made by constraining the pattern of cross-price elasticities using theories from consumer behavior and economics (Allenby 1989; Russell and Kamakura 1994; Bucklin, Russell and Srinivasan 1998). These procedures seek {{to reduce the number}} coefficients to be estimated and to require <b>cross</b> price <b>elasticities</b> to obey theoretically desirable patterns.

While there is ample evidence of within-mode demand effects, we know in general very little about what mode these new passengers came from. This paper addresses this issue by gathering existing evidence of cross-mode demand interactions (or <b>cross</b> <b>elasticities)</b> from studies conducted worldwide, and by presenting new evidence of cross-mode elasticities from Greater Oslo. We establish the theoretical, methodological and empirical states of the art with respect to demand effects at a system level, i. e. across transport modes.

Next, we present new evidence of <b>cross</b> <b>elasticities</b> from a study conducted in Greater Oslo based on 15, 000 travel observations. Our model illustrates very well how the same triggers, e. g. the cost of car use, bring about different mode switching effects depending on trip purpose and trip distance.

50|$|In {{the example}} above, the two goods, fuel and cars (consists of fuel consumption), are complements; that is, one is {{used with the}} other. In these cases the <b>cross</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand will be negative, {{as shown by the}} {{decrease}} in demand for cars when the price for fuel will rise.

50|$|Price {{elasticity}} also differentiates {{types of}} goods. An elastic good is one {{for which there}} is a relatively large change in quantity due to a relatively small change in price, and therefore is likely {{to be part of a}} family of substitute goods; for example, as pen prices rise, consumers might buy more pencils instead. An inelastic good is one for which there are few or no substitutes, such as tickets to major sporting events, original works by famous artists, and prescription medicine such as insulin. Complementary goods are generally more inelastic than goods in a family of substitutes. For example, if a rise in the price of beef results in a decrease in the quantity of beef demanded, it is likely that the quantity of hamburger buns demanded will also drop, despite no change in buns' prices. This is because hamburger buns and beef (in Western culture) are complementary goods. It is important to note that goods considered complements or substitutes are relative associations and should not be understood in a vacuum. The degree to which a good is a substitute or a complement depends on its relationship to other goods, rather than an intrinsic characteristic, and can be measured as <b>cross</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand by employing statistical techniques such as covariance and correlation.|$|E
50|$|In economics, a {{complementary}} good or complement {{is a good}} with a negative <b>cross</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand, {{in contrast to a}} substitute good. This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another good is decreased. Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is increased. If goods A and B are complements, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in; less of each good will be demanded. A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward; more of each good will be demanded. Basically this means that since the demand of one good is linked to the demand of another good, if a higher quantity is demanded of one good, a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other, and if a lower quantity is demanded of one good, a lower quantity will be demanded of the other. The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way: if the price of one good rises, so will the price of the other, and vice versa. With substitute goods, however, the price and quantity demanded of one good is related inversely to the price and quantity demanded of a substitute good, meaning that if the price or quantity demanded of one good rises, the price or quantity demanded of its substitute will fall.|$|E
5000|$|In economics, one {{way that}} two or more goods can be {{classified}} is by examining {{the relationship of the}} demand schedules when the price of one good changes. This relationship between demand schedules leads to classification of goods as either substitutes or complements. Substitute goods are goods which, as a result of changed conditions, may replace each other in use (or consumption). [...] A substitute good, in contrast to a complementary good, is a good with a positive <b>cross</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand. This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another good is increased; both in the same direction. Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is decreased. If goods A and B are substitutes, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift out. A decrease in the price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in.Examples of substitute goods include margarine and butter, tea and coffee, beer and wine. Substitute goods not only occur on the consumer side of the market but also the producer side. Substitutable producer goods would include: petroleum and natural gas (used for heating or electricity). The degree to which a good has a perfect substitute depends on how specifically the good is defined. Take for example, the demand for Rice Krispies cereal, which is a very narrowly defined good as compared to the demand for cereal generally. The fact that one good is substitutable for another has immediate economic consequences: insofar as one good can be substituted for another, the demands for the two kinds of good will be interrelated by the fact that customers can trade off one good for the other if it becomes advantageous to do so.|$|E

Abstract This paper examines {{whether there is}} justification {{for the implementation of}} peak pricing in the South Australian electricity market. Peak pricing in the South Australian electricity market appears to improve social welfare by improving consumer surplus, but this analysis is based on strong assumptions that include constant marginal cost and zero <b>cross</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand. An analysis of peak pricing was investigated with varying <b>cross</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand. It was found that a greater cross price elasticity value the greater the social welfare improvement in the off-peak model due to a greater increase in off-peak electricity consumption. However, the converse happens for the peak model. In the analysis of benefits outweighing costs, the estimated metering charge to consumers is approximately $ 120, but the savings on household bills due to time of use pricing almost covers the charge. However, the total expenditure on metering is likely to exceed savings on network costs of approximately $ 134 million over ten years. Hence, the costs are likely to outweigh the benefits of metering, the case for time of use pricing based is weak. Thesis (B. Ec. (Hons)) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Economics, 201...|$|E
