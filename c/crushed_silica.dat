Typical containers are made of air-tight steel cylinders called autoclaves that can withstand high temperature and pressure. In the case of quartz crystals, the container is heated at 300 °C (which produces a pressure of 140 MPA). Without the mineralizer, higher temperatures are required to solubilize silica.

A large spread of particle size (0. 5 mm – 2 mm), porosity (35 %- 60 %) under different temperatures (20 o C- 80 o C) were tested in order to validate the experimental modeling of both Darcy’s and Forchheimer's law parameters. Typical constants of head loss in porous media as a function of velocity using Forchheimer's model has been correlated by using hydraulic conductivity coefficients a*, b * which are experimentally evaluated at based conditions (Tw = 25 o C), (n = 50 %), (d = 1 mm).

Typical constant {{that can be}} used to estimate head loss for some of the most common design of granular media filters were correlated. An experimental set-up has been specially conceived to generate Reynolds number between 100 and 800. A capillary-type flow model was constructed to determine structural parameters of media and predict pressure gradients. Using one dimensionless equation of the capillary-type flow model with set of experiments, friction coefficient can be correlated as a function of pore Reynolds number in transition zone. Empirical relationships were developed using a plot of friction vs. Reynolds number similar to those that had been successfully used for the pipe flow. Analytical models were constructed to develop an equation for friction factor in transition zone (Inertial flow with increasing random irregular) in porous media as a function of flow type from first hydraulic principles and a semi-empirical equation of head loss in porous media for (100 ≤ Re ≤ 800) was evaluated...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a fundamental study {{to explore the}} role of particle shape in the shear behaviour of mixtures of sand and fine particles (fines) through macro-scale and grain-scale laboratory experiments together with interpretations {{in the framework of}} critical state soil mechanics and conceptual micromechanics models. Two non-plastic fines of distinct shape (angular <b>crushed</b> <b>silica</b> fines and rounded glass beads) were added to two uniform quartz sands (Toyoura sand and Fujian sand) to produce four binary mixtures. Laboratory quantification of particle shape and size was conducted for both fines and sands, and a series of undrained triaxial tests was performed to investigate the overall response of the mixed soils at different percentages of fines. One of the significant findings is that the critical state friction angle of a mixed soil is affected not only by the shape of coarse particles but also by the shape of fine particles, and this shape effect is coupled with fines content. When a small amount of <b>crushed</b> <b>silica</b> fines was added to either Toyoura sand or Fujian sand, the critical state friction angle increased slightly with fines content; however, when a small amount of glass beads was added to either sand, the critical state friction angle decreased markedly with an increase in fines content. A new index, termed combined roundness, is proposed to account for the coupled effects of particle shape and fines content. The study also provides evidence showing that the undrained shear behaviour and collapsibility of a mixed soil are closely related to the shape of its constituent particles: a mixed soil containing rounded fines tends to exhibit higher susceptibility to collapse than a mixed soil containing angular fines of the same percentage, and this tendency will become more evident if the base sand is also composed of rounded particles. In addition, the study provides the first experimental evidence showing that the quasi-steady state marks a transition from a metastable to a stable microstructure. It is postulated that in a binary mixture composed of fine and coarse particles that are both rounded, the particles favour rolling, thus yielding a microstructure that is unstable, whereas in a binary mixture composed of fine and coarse particles that are both angular, the particles favour sliding rather than rolling, thus leading to a much more stable structure and response. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{strength}} of liquid-bound granular pellets {{was measured by}} uniaxial compression at speeds of up to 150 mm/s. Pellets were made {{with a range of}} different powders: three fractions of spherical glass ballotini from 26 to 78 mu m in size, copper powders of spherical, irregular and dendritic morphology, and also a <b>crushed</b> <b>silica</b> powder. A silicone oil with nominal viscosity of 1 Pa s was used as binder in the majority of the work. The results for the three different sized ballotini all collapsed together onto a single curve when plotted as a dimensionless peak flow stress versus the capillary number. As found previously [22] [S. M. Iveson, J. Beathe, N. W. Page, The dynamic {{strength of}} partially saturated powder compacts: the effects of liquid properties, Powder Technol. 127 (2002) 149 - 161], there were two distinct regions of behaviour. At low capillary numbers where viscous forces were insignificant, the flow stress was independent of strain rate (Region 1), whereas at high strain rates where viscous forces dominate, the flow stress increased proportional to capillary number to the power of approximately 0. 5 (Region II). The flow stresses of the non-spherical powders were higher than for the spherical powders, however, the trends were identical. There was also the same transition from brittle to plastic behaviour as observed and modeled previously for spherical particles [23] [S. M. Iveson, N. W.

40|$|Current {{knowledge}} on the {{shear wave velocity}} (Vs) and associated stiffness (G 0) of sand is built mainly {{on the results of}} extensive laboratory studies on clean quartz sands. Often natural sands are not clean, but contain a certain amount of fines. The role of fines in altering the stiffness of sands is a matter of great concern, yet remains poorly understood. This paper presents an investigation into the problem through well-controlled laboratory experiments in conjunction with analysis and interpretation at the macro and micro scale. The laboratory experiments were conducted for a sequence of mixtures of clean quartz sand and <b>crushed</b> <b>silica</b> fines under saturated conditions, by the simultaneous use of the resonant column (RC) and bender element (BE) techniques. A broad range of states in terms of void ratio, confining stress and fines content was covered so as to obtain a comprehensive viewon the effect of fines and the possible interplay with other factors. Both the RC and BE tests showed that G 0 tends to decrease continuously as the quantity of fines is increased and the reduction rates are similar; a similar stress dependence is also obtained for G 0 from both types of testing. Nevertheless, G 0 values obtained from BE tests are notably greater than those obtained from RC tests, and this effect of testing method is shown to be coupled with the sample reconstitution method. A new approach that allows unified characterisation of G 0 values for both clean sand and sand–fines mixtures is developed in a sound theoretical framework, thereby providing important insights into the various empirical correlations that involve G 0 (or Vs) in geotechnical engineering practice. A new micro-scale mechanism is also suggested for the observed effect of fines, which attributes the reduction of G 0 caused by fines to the decrease in the coordination number at an approximately constant void ratio. © 2016, ICE Publishing.

40|$|The Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) {{consists}} of sand, cement, <b>crushed</b> quartz, <b>silica</b> fume, superplasticizer, water and steel fibers, with water-to cement (w/c) ratio of 0. 24 or lower. By omitting coarse aggregates in the mix, density and mechanical homogeneity can be maximized. Also, adding steel fibers increases durability by producing exceptionally high compressive and tensile strengths. As a result, a bridge using UHPC {{can be designed}} slimmer and longer with less amount of steel reinforcements than a conventional concrete bridge. UHPC developed by Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology (K-UHPC) was used to build a bridge, named “Hawkeye”, in Buchanan County, Iowa. This paper describes the design and construction process of the Hawkeye bridge {{which is the first}} bridge using K-UHPC in the United States. A unique pi-girder design, which is similar to the design previously developed at MIT, was adopted for the Hawkeye Bridge. The Hawkeye Bridge was successfully constructed using K-UHPC, utilizing local cement, sand and ready-mix trucks. Precast pi-girders were made at the Buchanan County, 17 miles (27 km) from the bridge site. A total of six girders were transported to the bridge site and installed in one day.

[...] "Mollymook" [...] is possibly a reference to the black-browed mollymawk. A cemetery overlooking the sea was in use by 1893. Some time around 1900, John Coller allowed public access to the beach and rock pools on his family estate (present day Collers Beach), and Mollymook began to earn a reputation as a popular retreat. Silica mining operations were commenced on Mollymook's southern headland by the Illawarra brick company prior to 1920 and brought an influx of workers to the quarries. Bannister Headland at the northern end of Mollymook beach was the site of a <b>silica</b> <b>crushing</b> facility and loading jetty in the early 20th Century. In 1924, a tramway was constructed across Narrawallee Inlet to transport silica from mining leases near Conjola for preparation and shipping. The industry declined during World War II.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the influence of}} <b>silica</b> sand, local <b>crushed</b> sand and different supplementary cementing materials (SCMs) to Portland cement (C) ratio (SCM/C) on the flexural fatigue performance of engineered cementitious composites (ECCs). ECC is a micromechanically-based designed high-performance polymer fiber reinforced concrete with high ductility which exhibits strain-hardening and micro-cracking behavior in tension and flexure. The relative high cost remains an obstacle for wider commercial use of ECC. The replacement of cement by SCMs, {{and the use of}} local sand aggregates can lower cost and enhance greenness of the ECC. The main variables of this study were: type and size of aggregates (local <b>crushed</b> or standard <b>silica</b> sand), type of SCMs (fly ash “FA” or slag), SCM/cement ratio of 1. 2 or 2. 2, three fatigue stress levels and number of fatigue cycles up to 1 million. The study showed that ECC mixtures produced with crushed sand (with high volume of fly ash and slag) exhibited strain hardening behavior (under static loading) with deformation capacities comparable with those made with silica sand. Class F-fly ash combined with crushed sand was the best choice (compared to class CI fly ash and slag) in order to enhance the ECC ductility with slag–ECC mixtures producing lowest deflection capacity. FA–ECC mixtures with silica sand developed more damage under fatigue loading due to higher deflection evolution than FA–ECC mixtures with crushed sand...|$|R
40|$|Sand non-plastic fines {{mixtures}} {{are usually}} studied at {{low stress level}} and with low fines contents. In the presented work, large to small strain behaviour of sand non-plastic fines mixtures with fines content up to a high value has been studied using a series of laboratory tests at relatively high stress levels. Two kinds of sand were chosen as the host sand, one is Leighton Buzzard sand (LBS) which has a strong mineralogy of quartz and is commonly used in laboratory tests, the other is pumice sand which can break at stresses reachable in conventional apparatuses. <b>Crushed</b> <b>silica</b> silt {{was chosen as the}} non-plastic fines. One-dimensional compression tests were conducted in oedometer apparatuses reaching elevated stresses to determine the normal compression line (NCL). Drained, undrained, and constant p’ shearing tests were conducted in triaxial apparatuses and a largest axial strain around 30 % was achieved to determine the critical state line (CSL). For the exploration of behaviour of mixtures at small strain level, tests with bender elements installed in the oedometer and triaxial apparatuses were carried out to determine the small-strain stiffness at different stress levels or shear strain levels during compression and shearing. The transitional fines content, FCt, is found to be 30 - 40 % for LBS-silt mixtures and 50 - 60 % for pumice-silt mixtures. The behaviour of mixtures is mainly controlled by the sand particles when the fines content is lower than FCt, and is mainly controlled by the fines particles when the fines content is greater than FCt. A unique NCL is found for clean LBS as well as for clean pumice sand in e-logp’ plane when particle breakage occurs, and as the fines content approaches to FCt less breakage occurs and the non-convergence of NCL becomes significant, the location of NCL moves down. After FCt is reached, the location of NCL turns to move up. Unique CSLs in e-logp’ plane are found for both clean sands and the mixtures with different fines content. The location of CSL moves in the same pattern as what the NCL shows. At low stress level the small-strain stiffness G 0 under compression depends on the volumetric condition and the mean effective stress p’. It decreases significantly when the fines is added to the clean sand since the strong force chains are disturbed. When the NCL in e-logp’ plane is reached at a relatively high stress level, G 0 can be written as a function only of p’. It increases as the fines content approaches to FCt since the strong force chains are strengthened. The small-strain stiffness G 0 at critical state can be written as a function only of the mean effective stress p’, and is lower than it under compression at the same p’. It decreases when the fines is added to the clean sand at a relatively low stress level where no sand particle breakage occurs. At high stress levels where particle breakage may occur, it increases as the fines content approaches to FCt. The strain-introduced stiffness anisotropy is observed at critical state. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade in North America, an {{increasing}} number of microbiological drinking water regulations have been used to manage groundwater resources that are potentially influenced by surface water. Regulations such as the Ontario Ministry of Environment Regulation 505, which requires at least a 60 day groundwater travel time between surface waters and drinking water wells, have been created with limited understanding of subsurface pathogen transport processes. Groundwater Under Direct Influence studies (GUDI or GWUDI in USA) are conducted to assess the need to treat well water at an extraction point. Currently, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge regarding factors that affect the transport of pathogens through porous media at the surface water-groundwater interface. Such information is required to supply sufficient quantities of drinking water in a cost effective and safe manner. Factors that affect pathogen transport through porous media include: properties of the pathogen (i. e. surface charge, size, and morphology), properties of the granular media (i. e. mineralogy, size, texture, angularity) and properties of the water (i. e. pH, ionic strength and content, and natural organic matter). This study examines the effects of ionic strength, grain size and influent virus concentrations on pathogen transport in porous media. Fourteen column tests were conducted using the bacteriophage MS 2 and 1. 5 µm microspheres; two commonly used non-pathogenic surrogates representative of human viruses and bacteria, respectively. Two size distributions of <b>crushed</b> <b>silica</b> sand, with median grain diameters of 0. 7 and 0. 34 mm, and two ionic strengths of 8 and 95 mmol/L were used. A 2 2 partial factorial design was used with a minimum of two replicates of each combination of the parameters. The results show that complete breakthrough of both viruses and microspheres occurred in medium sand at low ionic strength. It was found that increasing ionic strength by Ca 2 + addition precluded breakthrough of MS 2 in both the medium and fine sands. This represents a greater than 8 log reduction in peak effluent concentration and essentially complete attenuation. In fine sand, with low ionic strength water, a 5 log reduction in peak MS 2 concentrations was observed. In the same sand at high ionic strength, no MS 2 broke through the column, corresponding to a greater than 8 log removal. Since complete attenuation occurred in both grain sizes at high ionic strength, the effect of higher ionic strength in the fine sand was indistinguishable from the effect observed from raising the ionic strength in the medium sand. In contrast to the viruses, microsphere transport was essentially unaffected by increasing ionic strength under the conditions investigated. A 1 log reduction in peak concentration was observed in the high ionic strength water in the medium sand. In spite of this, grain size had a profound effect on the attenuation of microspheres. There was no evidence of microsphere breakthrough in any of the fine sand columns at the low or high ionic strengths, yielding a greater than 5 log reduction in microsphere concentration associated with grain size alone. The effect of varying virus concentration was also investigated. It was found that varying the concentration of viruses between 10 5 and 10 7 pfu/ml had no discernable effect on their observed transport characteristics; normalised peak breakthrough concentration, percent attenuation and retardation relative to a bromide tracer. Based on the results from this Thesis, in a riverbank filtration environment, there is reason to expect that, at comparable water qualities and in similar porous media, multiple logarithmic reductions of viruses and bacteria would occur over the much longer (than column length) flowpaths associated with RBF. There is also reason to expect this attenuation capability to vary based on riverbank grain size and water chemistry...|$|E
40|$|The Managing Landscape Change Project was {{commissioned}} by North Yorkshire County Council and carried out by Capita Symonds Ltd working with Oxford Archaeology North between April 2011 and April 2012. The work was funded through the English Heritage National Heritage Protection Commissions Programme, with a contribution from the County Council. North Yorkshire is a rich area for mineral resources, containing resources of sand and gravel, crushed rock aggregates, particularly limestone {{and to a lesser}} extent sandstone, clay, chalk, and silica sand. As minerals can only be worked where they are found, and as this may be in environmentally-sensitive or designated landscape areas, the need to manage impacts to an acceptable minimum in the planning and operating of extraction sites is a high priority. North Yorkshire County Council, as the mineral planning authority, is currently engaged in preparing its Minerals and Waste Development Framework (MWDF) to cover the period to 2030. Broader in scope than the archaeological resource assessment of aggregate area projects which have been undertaken in some other local authority areas through ALSF funding, this was a multi-disciplinary project seeking to assess environmental character and capacity for areas of surface mineral resource potential, covering historic environment as well as biodiversity and landscape issues, to inform the preparation of the North Yorkshire Minerals Core Strategy. The project area includes all of the areas of surface mineral resource potential (ASMRP) within North Yorkshire, excluding urban areas, the two national parks (Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors) and the City of York Council area.

40|$|This {{report is}} one of a series {{prepared}} by the British Geological Survey for various administrative areas in England for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister’s research project Mineral Resource Information in Support of National, Regional and Local Planning. The accompanying map relates to the county of Cheshire (comprising Cheshire, Boroughs of Halton and Warrington), and delineates the mineral resources of current, or potential, economic interest in the area and the sites where minerals are or have been worked. It also relates these to national planning designations, which may represent constraints on the extraction of minerals. Three major elements of information are presented: • the geological distribution and importance of mineral resources; • the extent of mineral planning permissions and the location of current mineral workings; and • the extent of selected, nationally-designated planning constraints. This wide range of information, much of which is scattered and not always available in a consistent and convenient form, is presented on a digitally-generated summary map on the scale of 1 : 100 000. This scale is convenient for the overall display of the data and allows for a legible topographic base on which to depict the information. However, all the data are held digitally at larger scales using a Geographical Information System (GIS), which allows easy revision, updating and customisation of the information together with its possible integration with other datasets. The information will form part of a Summary of the Mineral Resources of the North West Region. The purpose of the work is to assist all interested parties involved in the preparation and review of development plans, both in relation to the extraction of minerals and the protection of mineral resources from sterilisation. It provides a knowledge base, in a consistent format, on {{the nature and extent of}} mineral resources and the environmental constraints, which may affect their extraction. An important objective is to provide baseline data for the long term. The results may also provide a starting point for discussion on specific planning proposals for minerals extraction or on proposals, which may sterilise resources. It is anticipated that the map and report will also provide valuable background data for a much wider audience, including the different sectors of the minerals industry, other agencies and authorities (e. g. The Planning Inspectorate Agency, the Environment Agency, The Countryside Agency and English Nature), environmental interests and the general public. Basic mineral resource information is essential to support mineral exploration and development activities, for resource management and land-use planning, and to establish baseline data for environmental impact studies and environmental guidelines. It also enables a more sustainable pattern and standard of development to be achieved by valuing mineral resources as national assets.
