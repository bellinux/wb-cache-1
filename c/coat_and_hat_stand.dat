60|$|Henchard, however, {{leaving the}} town by the east road, {{proceeded}} to the second, or stone bridge, and thence struck into this path of solitude, following its course beside the stream till the dark {{shapes of the}} Ten Hatches cut the sheen thrown upon the river by the weak lustre that still lingered in the west.

Without any appearance of hurry he entered the much-discussed box, divested himself of his <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> <b>hat,</b> <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> for a moment in full view, looking around the house. His eyes rested for a moment upon the figures of the two men below, and a very grim smile parted his lips. He stepped a little into the background and remained for some time out of sight. Brightman's interest became intense.|$|R

But for a certainty, the 6 foot 4 inch Lincoln, in frock <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> top <b>hat,</b> <b>stood</b> peering through field glasses from behind a parapet at the onrushing rebels....") and other sources state he likely was not present on the day Lincoln visited Fort Stevens.|$|R

The Maniac reveals a tape recorder, which he used to record Pissani and the Superintendent's tirade, exposing their crime. The Maniac strips off his disguise, making him {{recognizable}} to Feletti, who identifies him as Paulo Davidovitch Gandolpho, the [...] "Prose Pimpernel of the Permanent Revolution" [...] and [...] "notorious sports editor of Lotta Continua". Revealing that the bomb replica can in fact work, setting it off on a timer, the Maniac has Bertozzo join his fellow policemen. Feletti attempts to stop the Maniac, citing the Maniac as an [...] "extremist" [...] and [...] "fanatic". The Maniac, instead of killing her, offers her an ultimatum: save the four corrupt policemen, acquitting them and the Maniac will be put behind bars; or leave them to die for their crime and unwittingly join the extremist movement as an accomplice. The Maniac then leaves to spread the recording.|$|R
