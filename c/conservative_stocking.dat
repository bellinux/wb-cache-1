40|$|During {{the decade}} a 'new {{rangeland}} science' has emerged. One of {{the tenets of}} this science is that pastoralists should not adhere to a single <b>conservative</b> <b>stocking</b> rate but rather, adopt an opportunistic strategy where numbers will fluctuate widely in response to good and bad seasons. It is further argued that opportunistic strategies give higher economic returns compared to strategies based on <b>conservative</b> <b>stocking</b> rates. In this paper the economics of four cattle management scenarios are compared. The analysis {{is based on a}} simulation model of the fluctuation over time of animal numbers, outputs and prices, using data from filed surveys and the literature. Results suggest that strategies based on <b>conservative</b> <b>stocking</b> rates would have higher net present values than strategies based on opportunistic stocking rates. Previous analyses have failed to account for losses due to drought and the costs of capital in livestock, and have tended to compare commercial with communal production rather than considering different smallholder production methods. To obtain the full benefits of destocking, however, a decision to destock must be made {{at the level of the}} community, as the benefits of improved outputs can only be achieved if the stocking rates of the communal grazing lands are reduced. Collective decisions about managing numbers incur considerable transaction costs, and so the emergence of new institutions is less likely. It is surprising that a tight tracking scenario (where cattle are managed by purchasing and selling to maintain numbers in equilibrium with the available feed resources) is recommended in recent literature as the results of this study suggest that such a system would incur considerable economic losses. The costs of a current programme to reclaim small dams illustrate the environmental costs of the opportunistic scenario. A tight tracking policy is likely to increase environmental degradation and its associated costs. Several serious flaws in papers that elevate opportunistic pastoral systems as giving higher economic returns are identified...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{production}} in "open-sky systems" such as extensive cattle ranching on natural grasslands {{is subject to}} inter-annual climatic variability and other market fluctuations. To tackle the dependency of livestock breeding on these factors, we conducted participatory modeling with cattle producers in Uruguay. The methodology consists of simulating possible scenarios to collectively evaluate the different herd management practice alternatives. In this paper, we present an Agent-Based Model built with stakeholders and designed to represent a breeding system on a typical extensive grazing area in the basaltic soils region (BR) of Uruguay. This model has three main modules: environment, biophysical and decisional sub-models. This modularity allows the conducting of virtual experiments to reveal how some herd management decisions (such as seasonal stocking rate adjustments) combined with a climatic series can result in resilience against drought periods and market movements. Long-term simulations were implemented to analyze {{the sensitivity of the}} model to key management parameters with varying climate conditions. The inter-annual climatic variability can seriously affect cattle production, even with <b>conservative</b> <b>stocking</b> rates. Rigid strategies are bound to fail and cause systems to break. Adaptive management emerged as a critical option for the sustainability of livestock breeding. The inter-annual climatic variability can seriously affect cattle production, even with <b>conservative</b> <b>stocking</b> rates. This result highlights the importance of adaptive management, one that can react to a changing environment, for the sustainability of livestock breeding. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} of multi-paddock rotational grazing on commercial livestock enterprises have been evident {{for many years}} in many countries. Despite these observations and the results of numerous studies of planned grazing deferment before the mid- 1980 s that show benefit to species composition, most recent rangelands grazing studies suggest that rotational grazing benefits neither vegetation nor animal production relative to continuous grazing. Detailed comparisons of research methods and practical experiences of successful practitioners of multi-paddock grazing systems identify a number of areas that explain why such different perceptions have arisen. Consistent with producer experience, published data from small paddock trials on both temporal and spatial aspects of grazing management indicates the potential for significantly higher production under multi-paddock rotational grazing relative to continuous grazing and <b>conservative</b> <b>stocking...</b>|$|E

Efforts to obtain accurate estimates of carbon stocks in the miombo woodlands are limited by a general lack of biomass estimation models (BEMs). This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of most commonly employed allometric models for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in miombo woodlands, and to develop new models that enable more accurate estimation of biomass in the miombo woodlands. A generalizable mixed-species allometric model was developed from 88 trees belonging to 33 species ranging in diameter at breast height (DBH) from 5 to 105 cm using Bayesian estimation. A power law model with DBH alone performed better than both a polynomial model with DBH and the square of DBH, and models including height and crown area as additional variables along with DBH. The accuracy of estimates from published models varied across different sites and trees of different diameter classes, and was lower than estimates from our model.

40|$|In {{commercial}} fisheries, {{stock collapse}} is an intrinsic problem caused by overexploitation or due to pure stochasticity. To analyze {{the risk of}} stock collapse, we apply a relatively simple Monte Carlo approach which can capture complex stock dynamics. We use an economic model with downward sloping demand and stock dependent costs. First, we derive an optimal exploitation policy as a feedback control rule and analyze the effects of stochasticity. We observe that the stochastic solution is more conservative compared to the deterministic solution at low level of stochasticity. For moderate level of stochasticity, a more myopic exploitation is optimal at small <b>stock</b> and <b>conservative</b> at large <b>stock</b> level. For relatively high stochasticity, one should be myopic in exploitation. Then, we simulate the system forward {{in time with the}} optimal solution.

40|$|Lates calcarifer {{supports}} important fisheries throughout tropical Australia. Community-driven fish stocking {{has resulted}} in the creation of impoundment fisheries and supplemental stocking of selected wild riverine populations. Using predominantly tag-recapture methods, condition assessment and stomach flushing techniques, this study compared the growth of stocked and wild L. calcarifer in a tropical Australian river (Johnstone River) and stocked fish in a nearby impoundment (Lake Tinaroo). Growth of L. calcarifer in the Johnstone River appeared resource-limited, with juvenile fish in its lower freshwater reaches feeding mainly on small aytid shrimp and limited quantities of fish. Growth was probably greatest in estuarine and coastal areas than in the lower freshwater river. Fish in Lake Tinaroo, where prey availability was greater, grew faster than either wild or stocked fish in the lower freshwater areas of the Johnstone River. Growth of L. calcarifer was highly seasonal with marked declines in the cooler months. This was reflected in both stomach fullness and the percentage of fish with empty stomachs but the condition of L. calcarifer was similar across most sites. In areas where food resources appear stretched, adverse effects on resident L. calcarifer populations and their attendant prey species should be minimised through cessation of, or more <b>conservative,</b> <b>stocking</b> practices...|$|E
40|$|THE STORY IN BRIEF: Cow/calf {{production}} means breeding {{animals are}} kept across years. This is problematic when annual forage production is highly variable. In this paper we estimate profit maximizing stocking strategies for alternative price situations when annual grass growth is variable. Study {{results suggest that}} breeding animals should constitute no more than 50 % to 70 % of total grazing capacity. Average net annual ranch returns were estimated to more than double when a yearling stocker enterprise augments and adds grazing-capacity flexibility to a base cow herd. THE PROBLEM: Range livestock producers face 2 major types of risk, prices and weather. Futures and options tools are available to help manage price risk but fluctuations in seasonal and annual forage production remain an ongoing and widespread problem. Dry periods create financial hardship and management problems for people throughout the world. Stafford Smith (1992) suggests that successful managers in Australia have coped with climate variability by pursuing some mix of two extreme management approaches. The first approach maintains a very <b>conservative</b> <b>stocking</b> rate so that destocking is rarely necessary. The second strategy aims to anticipate and follow fluctuating annual forage production levels by building stock levels during favorable years and destocking quickly during dry periods. In thi...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The recent {{trend to}} farming or re-domestication of feral goats poses serious {{questions}} for the ecological sustainability of the semiarid and arid rangelands of southern Australia. This paper reviews aspects of the biology and grazing habits of goats, and aspects of the Australian goat industry, relevant to their sustainable management in livestock enterprises. Key factors identified include high fertility and fecundity even under low seasonal rainfall conditions and a generalist feeding strategy. Adverse consequences for rangeland condition can be expected if seasonal or market conditions result in an imbalance between population growth and turnoff, resulting in high grazing pressures. Given the limited control of the reproductive process at the current stage {{of the development of}} goat farming, strategies aimed at ensuring continuity of sale of goats (e. g. on-property feed lots or supply chain and market development) will be important in ensuring that imbalances are avoided. <b>Conservative</b> <b>stocking</b> rates and use of seasonal risk management tools are also particularly relevant. The major research and development needs identified by this review, from a resource management perspective, concern the appropriate dry sheep equivalent rating for goat classes based on age, sex and reproductive status, the extent and consequences of heterogeneity of grazing in space, time, and across forage species, and development of means of establishing sustainable stocking rates based on the use of all available forage sources, including browse...|$|E
40|$|This thesis summarises {{research}} {{on the use of}} economic approaches in management decision making in the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery. Lobster fisheries globally tend to be well researched and data-rich yet economics is not widely integrated in the management process. This is surprising given that they supply a luxury food market and the entire supply chain is focussed on economic benefit. Lobster fisheries also tend be resilient to recruitment overfishing (Pollock, 1993), which means the basic management objective of biological sustainability tends to be easily met so there is scope to consider other goals of management. The use of economics in lobster fishery management is reviewed for fisheries globally. In some lobster fisheries, economic benefit is formally measured and reported as “sustainable economic yield”, which is the long-run, sustainable revenue from harvests minus the costs of harvesting. Reporting of economic yield does not always imply the use of this data in management decision processes, however there are cases where maximum economic yield (MEY) is used as a formal target including in Australian and New Zealand fisheries for Panulirus cygnus, P. ornatus and Jasus edwardsii. Bioeconomic models that combine stock, cost and price information are now being used in lobster fisheries including P. interruptus, P. argus, P. cygnus, J. edwardsii and Homarus americanus to evaluate regulations such as catch limits, season length, gear limits, and type. Economic theory has also been influential in the evolution of management systems used to constrain catch, in particular through the increased use of market-based and rights-based systems. These systems aim to provide incentives and mechanisms for the transfer of catch to more efficient operators and reward for <b>conservative</b> <b>stock</b> management that protects future harvests. Economic approaches can be used to resolve resource sharing issues in lobster fisheries with most research dealing with recreational and commercial interactions. A bioeconomic analysis of the Tasmanian rock lobster Jasus edwardsii fishery was conducted using a length- and sex-based model. The model was spatially and temporally structured to account for differences in costs of fishing and price. The analysis concluded that the current total allowable commercial catch (TACC) was too high to maximise economic yield and left the industry vulnerable to temporal changes in productivity. Alternative pathways to lower TACCs were explored but although these affected economic yield, differences were minor. Despite operating under ITQ management for over a decade, the presence of tradeable catch shares was insufficient for industry to motivate changes in the TACC to target MEY. Industry and government were motivated to exercise stewardship, in terms of acting to prevent stock collapse, but were reluctant to accept that economic yield and asset values could increase with lower catches. This bioeconomic analysis of different harvest strategies proved valuable in this debate, demonstrating a need for formal economic analysis as part of the suite of information used for setting TACCs even with the incentives provided by ITQs. The bioeconomic modeling approach was also used to examine the feasibility of a novel approach to increase productivity in the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery, which was to translocate lobsters from slow growth areas to faster growth areas. Change in stocks in response to translocation was assessed in comparison to the change in TACC that would be required to produce the same effect. These operations appeared viable with strongly positive net present value. When combined with quota management, a translocation of 100, 000 lobsters per annum improved most performance measures on a similar scale as would be achieved by a reduction in the total allowable catch of around 10...|$|R

40|$|The {{animal welfare}} issues {{faced by the}} {{northern}} Australian beef cattle industry {{are similar to those}} faced by extensive livestock production industries in other countries. However, northern Australia is characterised by climatic extremes and large areas/distances and these factors, together with low management inputs, mean that the industry faces significant challenges to assure high standards of animal welfare. In this review, the following issues are discussed: behavioural restriction; ‘natural disasters’; nutrition; health; a number of aspects relating to human–animal interactions, particularly mustering (gathering/rounding up) andmovingcattle,andtheconsequences for welfareof the timingandfrequency of handling; ‘surgical’ procedures; identification; transportation, including live export; and predation. The use of cattle adapted to the northern Australian environment alleviates many potential welfare problems. In addition, significant improvements to animal welfare could be made very quickly with a few straightforward management changes, such as improved planning for extended dry periods and drought; wider use of <b>conservative</b> <b>stocking</b> rates and supplementary feeding; broader implementation of vaccination programs; and greater implementation of weaner training programs. Further, a dramatic improvement for very large numbers of cattle could be made through the selection and use of polled genotypes to eliminate horned cattle. Research from Europe suggests that current Australian recommendations for the duration of land transportation journeys may be excessive and could compromise welfare, but further research under northern Australian conditions is required. Research and development is also needed in non-invasive alternatives to castration and spaying, but in the meantime the welfare of males could be improved by castrating earlier in the animals’ lives. However, it is acknowledged that this would require major changes to current cattle management practices...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the importance of}} spatial and temporal variation in plant quality and quantity for determining sustainable stocking rates in game, commercial and communal ranches in semi-arid savanna of the Northern Cape Province, South Africa, in wet and dry seasons over a two-year period. We focussed on variation in plant biomass, phosphorus (P), crude protein (CP) concentrations and dry matter digestibility as parameters most likely to affect sustainable stocking rates. Habitat type had greater effects on plant quality, plant biomass and species composition than management type. The commercially-managed area had the highest tree density in the rocky habitat and lower plant quality than other management types. All of these features indicate that land degradation is occurring on commercial ranches in spite of rotational grazing and lower stocking density than on communal ranches. We recommend that commercial ranchers should introduce {{a greater variety of}} stock and/or game to reduce selective grazing of certain plant species. Quality measures (CP and P) gave more <b>conservative</b> predictions of <b>stocking</b> density than biomass. In this region of the Northern Cape, seasonally-inundated pan habitats are particularly valuable in spite of low-standing crop because they have the highest year-round quality. Contrastingly, ranchers should only lightly stock open savanna habitats, in spite of high standing biomass, because they have low vegetation quality and may be particularly susceptible to degradation and invasion by poisonous and unpalatable plants.

40|$|Abstract General {{circulation}} models predict {{increases in}} air temperatures from 1 ◦ C to 5 ◦ C as atmospheric CO 2 {{continues to rise}} during the next 100 years. Thermal regimes in freshwater ecosystems will change as air temperatures increase regionally. As air temperatures increase, the distribution and intensity of precipitation will change which will in turn alter freshwater hydrology. Low elevation floodplains and wetlands will flood as continental ice sheets melt, increasing sea-levels. Although anadromous salmonids exist {{over a wide range}} of climatic conditions along the Pacific coast, individual stocks have adapted life history strategies—time of emergence, run timing, and residence time in freshwater—that are often unique to regions and watersheds. The response of anadromous salmonids will differ among species depending on their life cycle in freshwater. For pink and chum salmon that migrate to the ocean shortly after they emerge from the gravel, higher temperatures during spawning and incubation may result in earlier entry into the ocean when food resources are low. Shifts in thermal regimes in lakes will change trophic conditions that will affect juvenile sockeye salmon growth and survival. Decreased summer stream flows and higher water temperatures will affect growth and survival of juvenile coho salmon. Rising sea-levels will inundate low elevation spawning areas for pink salmon and floodplain rearing habitats for juvenile coho salmon. Rapid changes in climatic conditions may not extirpate anadromous salmonids in the region, but they will impose greater stress on many stocks that are adapted to present climatic conditions. Survival of sustainable populations will depend on the existing genetic diversity within and among <b>stocks,</b> <b>conservative</b> harvest management, and habitat conservation...|$|R
40|$|Several eel {{species have}} {{undergone}} extensive declines at {{both local and}} global level. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the reasons for the collapse of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) stock in an important area for biodiversity conservation (Comacchio Lagoon, Italy), in order to support the development of eel conservation plans. The records of silver eel catches from Comacchio describe the total migratory population and cover the period 1781 - 2013. The data are accompanied by information related to habitat loss and other local factors. The role of local factors on the decline of the local stock was investigated, while additional information from the literature was also used to discuss the effects of global factors (including glass eel harvest for aquaculture, climate-oceanographic changes, habitat loss, pollution and parasitism) on the three eel species A. anguilla, Anguilla japonica and Anguilla rostrata. The records from Comacchio provided significant information about the effects of local factors on the local eel populations in the past. However, the current population collapse, which started in the 1970 s, could not be explained by local factors. The literature on global factors suggests that the three eel species are under combined threat from various factors. The correlations between European aquaculture production data compared with the Comacchio yields and published data from other European eel and glass eel fisheries were found to be highly significant. Aquaculture, which depends entirely on wild-caught glass eels, seems to play a key role in the decline of natural <b>stocks.</b> <b>Conservative</b> estimates using FAO data showed that the current numbers of glass eels needed to support aquaculture production in Europe and Asia exceeds 2 × 109 specimens.
