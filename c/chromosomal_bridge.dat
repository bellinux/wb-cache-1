40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} an attempt as been made to assess the cytotoxic effects of dairy effluent in the root tip cells of Garlic (Allium sativum L.). The Garlic bulbs were treated with different concentrations of dairy effluent (5, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 %) at room temperature. The percentage mitotic index {{was found to be}} decreased significantly as the concentration of the effluent increased, except in 10 % concentration where the mitotic index is higher than control. The chromosomal aberrations were found to be increased as the concentration of the effluent increased when compared to control. The observed chromosomal abnormalities were <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bridge,</b> nuclear lesion, scattered chromosome, fragmented an aphase, fragmented meta phase, micro nuclei, scattered chromosome, sticky chromosome and sticky meta phase. According to our findings we can say that 10 % concentration of the effluent will promote the cell division when compare to control on the other hand higher concentration of the effluent will produce negative side effects on mitotic division in root tip cells of Garlic...|$|E
40|$|Mitosis must {{faithfully}} {{divide the}} genome such that each progeny inherits the same genetic material. DNA condensation {{is crucial in}} ensuring that chromosomes are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle for segregation, preventing DNA breaks or constrictions from the contractile ring. Histones form an octameric complex of basic proteins important in regulating DNA organization and accessibility. Histone post-translational modifications are altered during mitosis, although the roles of these post-translational modifications remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT), the enzyme catalyzing the addition of O-GlcNAc moieties to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins at serine and threonine residues, regulates some aspects of mitotic chromatin dynamics. OGT protein amounts decrease during M phase. Modest overexpression of OGT alters mitotic histone post-translational modifications at Lys- 9, Ser- 10, Arg- 17, and Lys- 27 of histone H 3. Overexpression of OGT also prevents mitotic phosphorylation of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM 1) and prevents its correct cellular localization during mitosis. Moreover, OGT overexpression results {{in an increase in}} abnormal <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bridge</b> formation. Together, these results show that regulating the amount of OGT during mitosis is important in ensuring correct chromosomal segregation during mitosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ethyl methanesulfonate is a {{synthetic}} compound widely {{used as a}} mutagen, teratogen and brain carcinogen and as a research chemical. While, the toxicity and carcinogenicity of ethyl methanesulfonate on humans and animals have been studied, less is known about its genotoxicity to plants. In this study, the genotoxic effects of ethyl methanesulfonate were investigated with growing chilli seedlings in solution culture. Compared with the control, the growth of chilli seedlings (taproot length, longest lateral root length and lateral roots number) decreased and showed statistics difference at ethyl methanesulfonate test concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mM. Stickiness, precocious movements, <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bridge,</b> micronucleus and others chromosomal aberrations were observed in chilli root tip cells were treated with various concentration of ethyl methanesulfonate. Frequency of chromosomal aberrations increased linearly with EMS test concentration between 10 and 50 mM and decreased above 50 mM which showed significant difference between control and 50 mM EMS or higher test concentration. Results {{of the present study}} suggest that ethyl methanesulfonate has genotoxicity on chilli root tip cells. The mechanism of genotoxicity of ethyl methanesulfonate needs further study.

40|$|The {{formation}} of the blastomere nucleus was examined in the rabbit zygote with the electron microscope. In late anaphase the chromosomes are bare and vesicles of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum are numerous {{in the vicinity of}} the chromosomes. In early telophase individual chromosomes attain their own nuclear envelope and they are called karyomeres. The envelope of the karyomeres contains small gaps within it at several places where the chromatin is exposed to the cytoplasm. Nuclear pores are also observed. In the cytoplasm short annulate lamellae appear adjacent to the karyomeres, and clusters of punctate substance are also present. From early telophase onward the karyomeres extend pseudopod-like structures, called karyopods, which extend toward other karyomeres or karyopods, and consequently fuse together and serve as <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bridges.</b> Eventually all of the karyomeres fuse into a dense nucleus and decondensation of the chromosomes occurs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of maternal in vivo haploid induction {{is not fully}} understood. In this study, the young embryos were identified by morphology, cytology and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers at different developmental stages in the cross HZ 514 (sweet corn) ×HZI 1 (inducer). The {{results indicated that the}} low seed setting rate was determined by the inducer pollen during the process of fertilization. The mosaic endosperm kernels and the different percentages of aneuploidy, mixploidy, lagged chromosome, micronuclei, <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bridge</b> and ring chromosome were found in the cross; 7. 37 % of the haploid embryos carried chromosome segments from HZI 1. About 1 % twin seedlings resulted from the cross and were analyzed by cytology and SSR markers. Four pairs of twin seedlings had different chromosome numbers (2 n= 20 and 2 n= 10 – 20) and there were some chromosome fragments from HZI 1. Aneuploidy, mixploidy and the abnormal chromosomes occurred in the in vivo haploid induction by HZI 1, which is the cytological basis for haploid induction and indicates that the inducer's chromosomes are prone to be lost during mitotic and meiotic divisions. Morphological, cellular and molecular evidences reveal that complete or partial chromosome elimination from inducer HZI 1 controls the maize in vivo haploid induction.

40|$|Recent {{data show}} that cells from many cancers exhibit massive {{chromosome}} instability. The traditional {{view is that the}} gradual accumulation of mutations in genes involved in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle controls results in tumor development. This, however, does not exclude the possibility that some mutations could be more potent than others in destabilizing the genome by targeting both chromosomal integrity and corresponding checkpoint mechanisms simultaneously. Three such examples of "single-hit" lesions potentially leading to heritable genome destabilization are discussed. They include: failure to release sister chromatid cohesion due to the incomplete proteolytic cleavage of cohesin; massive merotelic kinetochore misattachments upon condensin depletion; and chromosome under-replication. In all three cases, cells fail to detect potential <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bridges</b> before anaphase entry, indicating that there is a basic cell cycle requirement to maintain a degree of sister chromatid bridging that is not recognizable as chromosomal damage...|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} process of meiosis {{was investigated in}} Pinus wallichiana, P. strobus and their artificial hybrid (F 1) using microsporocytes. It is revealed that there were slightly lower chiasma frequency, lower ring bivalent frequency, lower meiotic index and distinctly higher frequency of aberrance (<b>chromosomal</b> <b>bridges,</b> fragments or micronuclei) in pollen mother cells (PMCs) of the hybrid (F 1) {{than those of the}} parental species, which showed a certain degree of differentiation between homologous chromosomes of the two parents. However, relatively higher frequency of ring bivalents and higher meiotic index in all the three entities indicate the great stability of genomes of parental species, and the differentiation of genomes between the two parents must have been slight. Total nineteen signal loci of 18 S rDNA were observed in nine bivalents of the hybrid (F 1), among which one bivalent bears two loci, while the others have only one. It is suggested that distinct differentiation at genetic level existed in homologous chromosomes of the two parental species, whereas only slight differentiation at karyotypic and genomic levels take place between the parent species.

40|$|Radiofrequency {{radiations}} (RFR) are electromagnetic frequencies (EMFs) that encompass frequencies {{below that}} of visible light and above that of extremely low frequency fields. Typical man-made sources of RFR include broadcast AM/FM/TV, mobile phones and base stations, microwave ovens and radar. In this investigation, the cytological and molecular effects of RF-EMFs at 2. 45 GHz, the frequency commonly used in telecommunication and microwave ovens, have been investigated in dividing root cells of five wheat cultivars following grain exposure to very short times ranging from one second to one minute. Enhanced mitotic activity and increased proportion of chromosomal abnormalities were scored in root cells as the exposure time increased. Most abnormalities are comprised of cmetaphase configurations, unoriented chromosomes at metaphase, laggards and multipolar ana-telophases indicating an action on the mitotic apparatus as well as <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bridges</b> {{and the formation of}} micronuclei indicating true clastogenic effects by the used radiation. In addition, the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting indicated marked DNA polymorphism among wheat cultivars and also as a result of exposure to RF-EMFs at 2. 45 GHz. The results indicate remarkable cytogenetic and molecular consequence of man-made sources of RFR in plants that may lead to genetic variation.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper is to assess cyto- and {{genotoxic}} effects of sodium nitrate on Allium cepa root tips by using different concentrations (i. e. 0, 1 %; 1 % and 5 %) for treating uniform healthy onion bulbs for three different periods of time: 6, 24 and 72 hours. In the end of the experiment the harvested root tips were prepared according to Feulgen’s squash technique using Schiff reagent and the investigations were realized according to Allium test. The cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of nitrate were investigated by calculating the mitotic index and observing all chromosomes’ complement alterations during the mitosis. The phase rate of cells undergoing mitosis is also studied. For microscopy investigations a Novex Holland B microscope with digital camera included was used. The cytogenetic analysis of nitrate effects revealed a strong decrease in the mitotic index which is more intense with the concentration and time of exposure. Moreover, this effect is associated in case of the variant treated with 5 % sodium nitrate acting for more than 24 hours, with the appearance of genotoxic effects such as chromosomal alterations, highly condensed chromatin expression easily identified during mitosis stages, sticky chromosomes and <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bridges</b> and laggards...|$|R
40|$|Root growth, G 2 length, and the {{frequency}} of aberrant mitoses and apoptotic nuclei were recorded after a single X-ray irradiation, ranging from 2. 5 to 40 Gy, in Allium cepa L. root meristematic cells. After 72 h of recovery, root growth was reduced in a dose-dependent manner from 10 to 40 Gy, but not at 2. 5 or 5 Gy doses. Flow cytometry plus TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) showed that activation of apoptosis occurred only after 20 and 40 Gy of X-rays. Nevertheless, irrespective of the radiation dose, conventional flow cytometry showed that cells accumulated in G 2 (4 C DNA content). Simultaneously, the mitotic index fell, though a mitotic wave appeared later. Cell accumulation in G 2 was transient and partially reversed by caffeine, thus it was checkpoint-dependent. Strikingly, the additional G 2 time provided by this checkpoint was never long enough to complete DNA repair. Then, in all cases, some G 2 cells with still-unrepaired DNA underwent checkpoint adaptation, i. e., they entered into the late mitotic wave with chromatid breaks. These cells and those produced by the breakage of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bridges</b> in anaphase will reach the G 1 of the next cell cycle unrepaired, ensuring the appearance of genome instabilit...|$|R

Eggs {{were exposed to}} the inhibitor (10 μM) at various times after parthenogenetic stimulation, and chromosomes of them were analyzed at the first cleavage metaphase. When eggs {{were exposed to the}} inhibitor during the period from metaphase II to anaphase II, a significant increase in incidences of structural chromosome aberrations (51. 1 % versus 1. 3 % in the control) and aneuploidy (30. 3 % versus 0. 7 % in the control) was found. Structural chromosome aberrations were observed in 10 – 20 % of eggs following treatments during telophase II, but there was no increased incidence of aneuploidy in treatments during this meiotic stage. When pronuclear eggs at S phase were targeted by the inhibitor, no significant increase in chromosome aberrations was found. Interestingly, when chromatids moved to each pole during anaphase II in the presence of ICRF- 193, most of them oriented their centromeres toward the spindle equator as if moving backwards. Moreover, lagging chromatids with the centromeres present were observed in more than 50 % of treated eggs. However, <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bridges</b> that resulted from chromosome stickiness did not appear in any egg. These findings indicate that ICRF- 193 can induce structural chromosome aberrations and aneuploidy in mouse secondary oocytes in meiotic stage-dependent manner. The induction of aneuploidy is due to disruption of the separation of sister centromeres at anaphase II. There appears to be mechanism(s) other than cleavable complex formation or chromosome stickiness behind the induction of structural chromosome aberrations by ICRF- 193...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} benzyladenine (BA) treatments {{which is a}} phyto-regulator or plant hormone on the cytology and growth of Nigella sativa L. (Black seed) and Allium cepa L. (onion) were investigated. Six concentrations of benzyladenine ranging from 5 to 55  ppm were applied for 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48  h. The treatments elevate the germination percentages of Nigella sativa L. and Allium cepa L. and increase the root growth of both plants. In contrast concentrations higher than 60  ppm for 48  h were caused an inhibition effect for both plant. The root growth initiation was concentration and/or time dependent. The applied concentrations of BA showed a promotor effect on cell division in root tips of both plants and caused an increase in their mitotic index values (MI). The elevation in MI values in root tips of Nigella sativa L. was more evident than that of Allium cepa L. All treatments changed the frequency of mitotic phases {{as compared with the}} control values. All the applied concentrations of BA significantly induced a number of chromosomal aberrations in root tip cells of Nigella sativa L. and Allium cepa L. The total percentages of abnormalities in Nigella sativa L. root tip cells were more than that in Allium cepa L. with all concentrations of BA. The most dominant types of observed abnormalities were stickiness, bridges, and C-mitosis. BA treatments produced a number of mitotic abnormalities in dividing cells in root tips of both plants resulting from its action on the spindle apparatus such as C-mitosis, lagging chromosomes and multipolar at ana-telophases. Also, BA induced vacuolated nuclei and irregular prophases. The induction of chromosomal stickiness and chromosomal aberrations such as bridges indicates its action on the chromosome. Also, the induced <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bridges</b> at ana-telophases indicates true clastogenic potential of this chemical. It may be concluded that BA causes toxic effect on root tip cells of Nigella sativa L. and Allium cepa L. and this toxicity induces different types of genic and chromosomal variations...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} hazards from internally admin istered radionuclides used {{in nuclear}} medicine are usually compared {{with each other}} and with diagnostic x-rays on the basis of the absorbed dose in rads with no regard to the dose rate of the radiation. Using the production of chro mosomal aberrations (bridges) in rat liver cells as an endpoint for biological damage, we com pared the effectiveness of irradiation when the same total dose was delivered rapidly with x-ray or at lower dose rates with radioactive colloids of lismin or 198 Au. Because in the adult liver there is little cell division with associated loss of damaged cells, chromosomal aberrations are retained when irradiation is either rapid or protracted. However, when an urgent de mand for cells occurs, such as after surgical removal of a major portion of the liver, the liver responds by undergoing rapid prolifera tion which reveals this chromosomal damage. In a range of dose between 125 and 1, 000 rads, irradiation with x-rays or flsmln was approxi mately twice as effective as 198 Au in inducing <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bridges.</b> The relationship of dam age (bridges) to dose appears to be linear in each case and extrapolation to low doses sug gests a similar time-dose effect, but direct proof of this is lacking. The significance of dose rate on the amount of biological damage caused by absorbed doses and dose rates encountered in nuclear medicine has re ceived minimal attention (1 â€” 3).

40|$|In this thesis, {{the main}} {{focus has been on}} the {{childhood}} cancer neuroblastoma, {{one of the most common}} and lethal childhood tumours. Neuroblastoma has througout the years continued to be a clinical and biological enigma. Our first focus was on one of the most important biological risk factors in neuroblastoma [...] amplification of the oncogene MYCN in the tumour cells. Because amplified MYCN typically reside in ring-formed chromatin structures lacking centromeres (so-called double minutes, DMs) it remained unknown for a long time how the amplified sequences were maintained in the growing tumour. We could show that MYCN-carrying DMs in neuroblastoma cells translocate from the nuclear interior to the periphery at the interphase-prophase transition and that they are preferentially anchored to human chromosomes at sites adjacent to the telomeres, resulting in a random segregation pattern of DMs to post-mitotic neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, by making human/murine hybrids we showed that DMs do not bind to specific positional elements in human chromosomes. Our data explain the vast intercellular variety of MYCN copy number in neuroblastoma. Moving on from here, in our next study we found that telomeres without detectable TTAGGG-repeats were associated with MYCN amplification and the generation of <b>chromosomal</b> breakage-fusion <b>bridge</b> cycles and could confirm that MYCN amplification was associated with reduced tumour telomere length in vivo. We also found a possible association between poor survival and elongated telomeres, which needs to be studied further. Our third pillar was that of whole chromosome changes, with a focus on intratumoural diversity. We demonstrated a previously unreported high degree of intercellular variation in chromosome copy number and found indications that loss of chromosomes from a tetraploid state is a major route towards this prominent intra-tumour genomic diversity in aneuploid neuroblastomas. Taken together, these studies suggest that neuroblastoma genomes are highly plastic, which may to some extent explain the poor response to oncological treatment for some of these tumours...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} long speculated that {{mammalian}} Rev 3 plays an important, yet unknown role(s) during mam-malian development, as deletion of Rev 3 causes embryonic lethality in mice, whereas no other trans-lesion DNA synthesis polymerases studied to date {{are required for}} mouse embryo development. Here, we report that both subunits of Polf (Rev 3 and Rev 7) show an unexpected increase in expression during G 2 /M phase, but they localize independently in mitotic cells. Experimental depletion of Rev 3 results in {{a significant increase in}} anaphase <b>bridges,</b> <b>chromosomal</b> breaks/gaps and common fragile site (CFS) expression, whereas Rev 7 depletion primarily causes lagging chromosome defect with no sign of CFS expression. The genomic instability induced by Rev 3 depletion seems to be related to replication stress, as it is further enhanced on aphidicolin treat-ment and results in increased metaphase-specific Fanconi anemia complementation group D type 2 (FANCD 2) foci formation, as well as FANCD 2 -positive anaphase bridges. Indeed, a long-term de-pletion of Rev 3 in cultured human cells results in massive genomic instability and severe cell cycle arrest. The aforementioned observations collect-ively support a notion that Rev 3 is required for the efficient replication of CFSs during G 2 /M phase, and that the resulting fragile site instability in Rev 3 knockout mice may trigger cell death during embry-onic development...|$|R
40|$|Background: Amplification of 3 q 26 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} genetic alterations in many human malignancies. Recently, we isolated a novel oncogene eIF- 5 A 2 within the 3 q 26 region. Functional study has demonstrated the oncogenic role of eIF- 5 A 2 in the initiation and progression of human cancers. In the present study, we aim to investigate the physiological and pathological effect of eIF- 5 A 2 in an eIF- 5 A 2 transgenic mouse model. Methods: An eIF- 5 A 2 transgenic mouse model was generated using human eIF- 5 A 2 cDNA. The eIF- 5 A 2 transgenic mice were characterized by histological and immunohistochemistry analyses. The aging phenotypes were further characterized by wound healing, bone X-ray imaging and calcification analysis. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) were isolated to further investigate molecular mechanism of eIF- 5 A 2 in aging. Results: Instead of resulting in spontaneous tumor formation, overexpression of eIF- 5 A 2 accelerated the aging process in adult transgenic mice. This included decreased growth rate and body weight, shortened life span, kyphosis, osteoporosis, delay of wound healing and ossification. Investigation of the correlation between cellular senescence and aging showed that cellular senescence is not required for the aging phenotypes in eIF- 5 A 2 mice. Interestingly, we found that activation of eIF- 5 A 2 repressed p 19 level and therefore destabilized p 53 in transgenic mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells. This subsequently allowed for the accumulation of chromosomal instability, such as errors in cell dividing during metaphase and anaphase. Additionally, a significantly increase in number of aneuploidy cells (p < 0. 05) resulted from an increase in the incidences of misaligned and lagging <b>chromosomal</b> materials, anaphase <b>bridges,</b> and micronuclei in the transgenic mice. Conclusion: These observations suggest that eIF- 5 A 2 mouse models could accelerate organismal aging by increasing chromosome instability. © 2011 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
