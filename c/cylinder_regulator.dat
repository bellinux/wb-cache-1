50|$|M2A1-2 is the {{variation}} of the M2 devised during the Korean War. These had straight sided backpack frames, vented gas caps, a <b>cylinder</b> sized <b>regulator</b> and a safety valve. These are much more common today than WWII models.|$|R
50|$|The Compressed Gas Association (CGA) is {{the oldest}} major {{industrial}} and medical gas association in the world.In January 1913, Robert King {{sent a letter to}} the 75 manufacturers of compressed gases in the United States inviting them to attend a meeting in New York City for the purpose of organizing a new industry association: the Compressed Gas Manufacturers Association. By March of the same year, the Association moved into offices in New York City. By 1914, the Association had 77 U.S. members and 5 Canadian members. The name of the Association was changed in 1948 to include not only manufacturers of compressed gases, but also manufacturers of <b>cylinders,</b> <b>regulators,</b> valves and other equipment in the industry.|$|R

50|$|The {{nature of}} these 'dives' in cramped sumps did not {{prioritize}} the need for buoyancy control or underwater propulsion - so the bare minimum needed was a mask, a <b>cylinder,</b> a <b>regulator,</b> a method of attachment to the body and, only on rare occasions, a set of fins.|$|R
50|$|A {{means of}} adding gas to the bladder, {{generally}} a low pressure direct feed or power inflator that injects gas {{from a low}} pressure hose from the diving <b>cylinder's</b> diving <b>regulator</b> or an auxiliary cylinder to the bladder(s) of the BC, that is controlled by an inflation valve, and usually an oral inflation option. These are usually {{at the end of}} a corrugated rubber inflation hose.|$|R
50|$|Regulator set: Each primary sidemount <b>cylinder</b> {{requires}} a <b>regulator</b> 1st stage, a regulator second stage and a submersible pressure gauge (SPG). The left hand cylinder will {{also include a}} low-pressure inflator (LPI) for BCD inflation. If a drysuit is used, the drysuit inflator will {{be attached to the}} right hand cylinder. The most common regulator configuration mimicks hogarthian regulator set-up, with a long (5-7 foot) hose on the right cylinder and a short hose on the left <b>cylinder,</b> where the <b>regulator</b> is contained in a bungee necklace. However, some sidemount divers prefer an opposite configuration, two long hoses or two short hoses.|$|R
50|$|Minimum Equipment: Mask, fins, 60 {{cubic foot}} or greater single <b>cylinder,</b> single hose <b>regulator</b> with an octopus and {{submersible}} pressure gauge, exposure suit suitable for diving location, BC with power inflator, slate and tables, knife, timing device, appropriate weight, reel, two battery powered lights.|$|R
50|$|The {{passages}} of the steam jacket were large {{enough that the}} safety valve could also be mounted on the <b>cylinder</b> block. The <b>regulator</b> could also conveniently be built into the casting, immediately between the dome passage and the valve chest, without requiring long steam pipes.|$|R
50|$|The Bodok seal is a {{specialised}} washer {{that ensures}} a gas-tight seal between the <b>cylinder</b> yoke or <b>regulator</b> of an anaesthetic machine or any medical device requiring a gas supply, and a gas cylinder. It was introduced {{along with the}} pin index safety system during the 1950s.|$|R
25|$|The {{apparatus}} used in {{gas welding}} consists basically of an oxygen source and a fuel gas source (usually contained in <b>cylinders),</b> two pressure <b>regulators</b> and two flexible hoses (one for each cylinder), and a torch.

2500|$|For a {{few years}} in the mid-1950s, Draeger made the Draeger Delfin II (their first scuba {{regulator}} - it was marketed as the Barakuda (now IAC) in the USA): this was a single stage single hose [...] "pendulum"" [...] regulator with only one ambient pressure (corrugated) hose: the exhaled air went back down the hose to the <b>cylinder</b> mounted <b>regulator</b> and was released to outside through a one-way valve inside the casing. The end of the flexible tube {{was connected to the}} mouthpiece by a short quarter-circle of hard tube. The two way hose would have caused dead space similar to a rebreather with a pendulum system.|$|R
5000|$|Vest BCs {{typically}} provide up {{to about}} 25 kilograms of buoyancy (depending on size) and are fairly comfortable to wear, if of the correct size and adjusted to fit the diver. Vest BCs {{are the most common}} type among recreational divers because they can integrate buoyancy control, weights, attachment points for auxiliary gear, and cylinder retention in a single piece of gear. The diver need only attach a <b>cylinder</b> and <b>regulator</b> set {{in order to have a}} complete scuba set. Some [...] "tech-rec" [...] (technical and recreational) vest BC's have the ability to carry multiple cylinders - Twin sets on the back, and sling cylinders at the sides, suspended from D-rings. The lack of flexibility of positioning the D-rings due to structural constraints on some designs is partly compensated by fitting larger numbers of D-rings, some of which may be in the right place for a given diver.|$|R
25|$|Each gas must be {{provided}} in sufficient quantity to adequately supply the diver throughout the relevant sector(s) of the dive. This is done by selecting a cylinder which when filled can contain at least the required amount of gas, including any relevant reserve and contingency allowance, above the minimum functional pressure at the depth where the gas will last be used. Buoyancy and trim consequences of the tank choice should be considered, both {{as a consequence of}} the inherent buoyancy characteristics of the <b>cylinder</b> complete with <b>regulator</b> and other accessories, and due to the use of the contents during the dive.|$|R
5|$|Single <b>cylinder</b> with dual <b>regulators</b> {{consists}} of a single large back mounted cylinder, with two first-stage regulators, each with a second-stage regulator. This system is used for diving where cold water makes the risk of regulator freezing high and functional redundancy is required. It is common in continental Europe, especially Germany. The advantage is that a regulator failure can be solved underwater to bring the dive to a controlled conclusion without buddy breathing or gas sharing. However, {{it is hard to}} reach the valves, so there may be some reliance on the dive buddy to help close the valve of the free-flowing regulator quickly.|$|R
50|$|Although many {{2-way valves}} {{are made in}} which the flow can go in either {{direction}} between the two ports, when a valve is placed into a certain application, flow is often expected to go from one certain port on the upstream side of the valve, to the other port on the downstream side. Pressure regulators are variations of valves in which flow is controlled to produce a certain downstream pressure, if possible. They are often used to control flow of gas from a gas <b>cylinder.</b> A back-pressure <b>regulator</b> is a variation of a valve in which flow is controlled to maintain a certain upstream pressure, if possible.|$|R
5000|$|Single <b>cylinder</b> with dual <b>regulators</b> {{consists}} of a single large back mounted cylinder, with two first-stage regulators, each with a second-stage regulator.

25|$|The {{open circuit}} scuba set is usually stored and often transported as {{separate}} major components - harness, <b>cylinder(s)</b> and <b>regulator(s),</b> and usually buoyancy compensator, and assembled shortly before use. The scuba set is {{life support equipment}} and correct assembly and function {{is critical to the}} success of the dive, and in some cases to the survival of the user. The equipment is robust and reliable, is easily tested for correct function, and assembly is simple enough for the user after basic instruction and some practice. Some service providers will assemble scuba sets for their clients, particularly if it is rental equipment, but all certification agencies require the diver to be competent to assemble their own set. Scuba assembly generally entails mounting the cylinder(s) on the harness, connecting the <b>regulator(s)</b> to the <b>cylinder</b> valves, ensuring an uncontaminated and pressure-tight seal, and connecting the low pressure hose to the buoyancy compensator inflation valve. These operations usually require no tools, or at most a wrench, used to bolt twin cylinders to a backplate. Validating the function of the regulator and inflation valve is usually considered part of scuba assembly, but may also be considered part of pre-dive checks, and if there is a significant interval between assembly and use, is commonly done twice.|$|R
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} {{consists of}} a single large cylinder, usually back mounted, with one first-stage regulator, and usually two second-stage regulators. This configuration is simple and cheap but it has only a single breathing gas supply: it has no redundancy in case of failure. If the <b>cylinder</b> or first-stage <b>regulator</b> fails, the diver is totally out of air and faces a life-threatening emergency. Recreational diver training agencies train divers {{to rely on a}} buddy to assist them in this situation. The skill of gas sharing is trained on most entry level scuba courses. This equipment configuration, although common with entry-level divers and used for most sport diving, is not recommended by training agencies for any dive where decompression stops are needed, or where there is an overhead environment (wreck diving, cave diving, or ice diving) as it provides no functional redundancy.|$|R
5|$|The new European Norm EN144-3:2003 {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} valve, similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar DIN valves, however, with a metric M26×2 fitting on both the <b>cylinder</b> and the <b>regulator.</b> These are intended to be used for breathing gas with oxygen content above that normally found in natural air in the Earth's atmosphere (i.e. 22–100%). From August 2008, these were required in the European Union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen. The idea behind this new standard is to prevent a rich mixture being filled to a cylinder that is not oxygen clean. However even with use of the new system there still remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that a cylinder with a new valve remains oxygen-clean - which is exactly how the previous system worked.|$|R
5000|$|Single {{cylinder}} {{consists of}} a single large cylinder, usually back mounted, with one first-stage regulator, and usually two second-stage regulators.

500|$|Y and H {{cylinder}} valves {{have two}} outlets, {{each with its}} own valve, allowing two regulators to be connected to the <b>cylinder.</b> If one <b>regulator</b> [...] "freeflows", which is a common failure mode, or ices up, which can happen in water below about 5°C, its valve can be closed and the cylinder breathed from the regulator connected to the other valve. The difference between an H-valve and a Y-valve is that the Y-valve body splits into two posts roughly 90° to each other and 45° from the vertical axis, looking like a Y, while an H-valve is usually assembled from a valve designed as part of a manifold system with an additional valve post connected to the manifold socket, with the valve posts parallel and vertical, which looks a bit like an H. Y-valves are also known as [...] "slingshot valves" [...] due to their appearance.|$|R
