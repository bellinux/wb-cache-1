40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the study was to review an Early <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> for young {{children}} with developmental disabilities and their families. The researchers focused on overall implementation of the system in the U. S. and then focused on Georgia.

40|$|Sandy coasts {{are highly}} dynamic environments, governed by {{interactions}} of various physical, biological and societal processes. Waves, currents and wind, for example, are important environmental drivers for coastal morphodynamics. At the same time, these drivers affect ecological processes, with possible feedbacks to groundwater levels, nutrient dynamics and dune morphology. Besides these natural dynamics {{that constitute the}} coastal ecosystem, humans may influence this system, driven by the benefits they wish to obtain from the system and the societal dynamics involved. A <b>common</b> <b>intervention</b> in coastal <b>systems</b> is the nourishment of sand, of which the Sand Motor on the Delfland coast, The Netherlands, is an example with an unprecedented volume of 21. 5 Mm 3. Our aim is to improve our predictive understanding {{of this type of}} sandy nourishment as an ecosystem, in order to apply it elsewhere. With our research programme NatureCoast we have seized the opportunity to gather strategically important interdisciplinary knowledge from the Sand Motor, which forms a unique full-scale experiment. The programme includes 12 PhD projects, in which the key morphological, hydrological, geochemical, ecological and societal processes that govern the evolution and acceptability of this type of nourishments are studied (Figure 1). The innovative aspect of our approach lies in the integration of these research projects through interdisciplinary research questions. At the same time, we incorporate the wishes of public and private parties. These include the benefits they wish to exploit from the coastal system, such as protection against flooding by the dunes; so-called ecosystem services. In our work, we show that the concept of ecosystem services is useful {{to bridge the gap between}} the various research disciplines and parties involved...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} if the CATT <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> was effective in enhancing the skills of one student to prevent referral to special education and overcome learning barriers related to reading. A case study was compiled with data from three separate measures to determine if the CATT <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> was effective at improving the case study student's barriers to learning in the subject of reading. When results from the case study student were analyzed, it was difficult to find progress that would indicate he was reading at grade level. While the data collected in regards to him was inconclusive, his teacher and support staff at the school believed that he made enough progress to not require a referral to special education.   In addition, this thesis examines teacher perspectives as to the effectiveness and use of the system within a classroom, as well as if the documentation and training provided are believed to be comprehensive and efficient. The CATT <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> is a system for general education teacher use that helps teachers identify specific student barriers to learning, identify appropriate classroom and/or individual intervention strategies, provides equipment if appropriate, and incorporates a progress monitoring <b>system</b> to determine <b>intervention</b> effectiveness. It was implemented in both the 2010 - 2011 and 2012 - 2013 school years, and surveys to examine teacher perception were completed {{at the end of each}} year The results from the survey indicate that the teachers believed the <b>intervention</b> <b>system</b> was easy to use, yet teachers did not believe it reduced special education referrals or that the documentation provided by the CATT <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> was helpful or easy to use. This may have been related to the training provided prior to using the system, as teachers believed that it did not appropriately address how to use the system. Despite these results, teachers believed that the CATT <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> was effective at improving student success. Further research must be conducted in order to further support the research questions presented in this survey study and the ability of the CATT <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> to improve a student's ability to be a successful learner within a classroom.   M.

40|$|One of {{the primary}} goals of any multi-tiered <b>intervention</b> <b>system</b> {{delivered}} within an educational setting is to provide an appropriate level of support to each student based upon his or her demonstrated level of need. It has been established that approximately 95 % of students served under a multi-tiered <b>intervention</b> <b>system</b> will have their needs met without ever entering into the highest tier of support. However, for the 5 % of students who do enter into the restrictive settings associated with top tier service delivery, educational, as well as overall life outcomes, have traditionally been demonstrated to be very poor. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effectiveness of utilizing a multi-tiered <b>intervention</b> <b>system</b> to address behavior problems exhibited by primary age students within a highly restrictive, top tier setting. Although multi-tiered <b>intervention</b> <b>systems</b> such as Response to Intervention (RtI) and Positive Behavior Support (PBS) have previously been applied across various types of educational settings to address both academic and behavioral deficits, little attention has been paid to the utility of such approaches for addressing problem behavior for students who are educated within alternative educational settings. The current study sought to evaluate the utility of a behaviorally based RtI service delivery model, delivered within a highly restrictive setting, to decrease problem behaviors, increase pro-social behavior, and to guide placement decisions...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} an Early <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> (EIS) is to {{identify}} police officers at risk of engaging in corruption or misconduct and to treat their problematic behaviour through remedial <b>interventions.</b> Early <b>intervention</b> <b>systems</b> are primarily preventative in nature, focusing on the identification and management of officers {{who have not yet}} engaged in misconduct, but who are showing signs that their behaviour which, if left unchecked, could escalate in future, thus leading to potential misconduct. Whilst at times problematic or risk-taking behaviour by officers will be evident and observable to police agencies, at other times the outward signs of a problem behaviour may be difficult to detect. Because of this difficulty, existing EISs normally rely on databases and predetermined behavioural indicators to generate electronic flags when an officer’s behaviour is deemed to have fulfilled certain criteria indicating the existence of problematic behaviour. As well as helping police agencies manage risk and prevent misconduct, early <b>intervention</b> <b>systems</b> can be beneficial for individual officers as they are given an opportunity to correct problematic behaviour without being inducted into a disciplinar...|$|R
