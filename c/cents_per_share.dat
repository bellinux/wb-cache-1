5|$|Railway traffic {{throughout}} the state was paralyzed, as some train bridges collapsed, and extensive damage {{was found in the}} track ballast in multiple rail lines. Kansas City Southern Railway reported it expected a net loss of five <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> on its annual earnings due to the stoppage affecting its Mexican subsidiary. The company later reported a drop of $33 million (2010 USD) in revenue due to hurricane damage. The damage to the railway infrastructure caused automotive part shortages throughout North America. General Motors was forced to cancel shifts at plants in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas. Ford also idled production in its Oakville, Ontario assembly plant, and suffered two-week delays in U.S. deliveries of its Fiesta model due to the rail track damage. The damage to the road system paralyzed a route used by 40% of the trade between the United States and Mexico, as 22,000 trucks were stalled after damage to the Nuevo LaredoMonterrey highway.|$|E
25|$|An earlier crisis {{occurred}} in 2007–2008, where {{the demand for}} asset-backed commercial paper dropped, causing the collapse of some structured investment vehicles.

The average sale price per unit was up from $240 to $315, however. This should continue to increase with sales of the new Android Priv device which was selling at a premium price ($800 in Canada, for example). In Q3 of 2015, BlackBerry had a net loss of $89 million U.S. or 17 <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share,</b> but only a $15 million net loss, or three <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share,</b> when excluding restructuring charges and other one-time items.|$|E

25|$|When Microsoft {{went public}} and {{launched}} its {{initial public offering}} (IPO) in 1986, the opening stock price was $21; after the trading day, the price closed at $27.75. As of July 2010, with the company's nine stock splits, any IPO shares would be multiplied by 288; {{if one were to}} buy the IPO today given the splits and other factors, it would cost about 9cents. The stock price peaked in 1999 at around $119 ($60.928 adjusting for splits). The company began to offer a dividend on January 16, 2003, starting at eight <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> for the fiscal year followed by a dividend of sixteen <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> the subsequent year, switching from yearly to quarterly dividends in 2005 with eight cents a share per quarter and a special one-time payout of three dollars per share for the second quarter of the fiscal year. Though the company had subsequent increases in dividend payouts, the price of Microsoft's stock remained steady for years.|$|E
25|$|Dynegy Inc. {{posted a}} second-quarter 2012 loss of $1.06 billion, an {{increase}} to $8.65 per share from 95 <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> a year ago. The company blamed, among other things, markedly lower demand for its electricity, much lower prices for its coal, and a $941 million noncash loss {{caused by the}} transfer of its coal unit to Dynegy Holdings. The company also said it now hoped to emerge from bankruptcy in September 2012.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, the White Pass and Yukon Corporation Ltd., a new holding company, was {{incorporated}} {{to acquire the}} three railway companies comprising the WP from the White Pass and Yukon Company, Ltd., which was in liquidation. The railway was financially restructured. While most other narrow-gauge systems in North America were closing around this time, the WP remained open.

25|$|The Community Bankers US Government Fund {{broke the}} buck in 1994, paying investors 96 <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share.</b> This {{was only the}} second failure in the then 23-year history of money funds {{and there were no}} further {{failures}} for 14 years. The fund had invested a large percentage of its assets into adjustable rate securities. As interest rates increased, these floating rate securities lost value. This fund was an institutional money fund, not a retail money fund, thus individuals were not directly affected.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategy}} {{shift at}} first {{seemed to be}} working, because sales of the redesigned 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors improved, even as AMC's overall production decreased from the record level achieved in 1963. However, corporate earnings per share were a meager 27 <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share,</b> the lowest since AMC made its famous compact car comeback in 1958. Investors received a message of the changing fortune of the automaker when the company's 1966 annual financial report was delivered in a plain brown wrapper, instead of the previous year's glossy cover.|$|E
25|$|On January 10, 2008, Young Broadcasting {{announced}} it would sell KRON-TV. The company had been encountering difficulties in meeting interest payments on its outstanding debt and Young's stock, which had been trading for a few <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share,</b> would ultimately be delisted from NASDAQ in January 2009, after failing to meet the minimum standards for being on the exchange. One month later on February 13, Young made a filing to place the company under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Debt incurred from its 1999 purchase of KRON {{was believed to be}} one key factor behind the company's cash problems. Young originally hoped to close a sale of the station {{by the end of the}} first quarter of 2008, but no buyer emerged.|$|E
50|$|NPC is {{investing}} more on its R&D activities: {{this includes}} carrying out {{joint research projects}} with local institutions and universities; systematic link with local and foreign research centers; and design and operation of pilot plants for research purposes.

UK, France and the Netherlands rank the next with 18 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> <b>share,</b> 12 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> <b>share</b> and 11 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> <b>share,</b> respectively.

It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices. In 2010, Dell paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.|$|E
25|$|The deals {{also allowed}} the merged banks {{to expand into}} new {{business}} ventures. PSFS soon began expanding into new services such as equipment leasing, corporate finance and real estate development. In September 1983 PSFS converted from a mutual organization to a stock organization selling 35 million shares at US$11.25 each. In January 1984 PSFS began expanding into financial service by buying a loan portfolio and mortgage business from General Electric Credit Corp. for US$568 million. In April 1985 the company acquired four savings and loans in Florida and began paying five <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> quarterly dividend to stockholders.

2500|$|Statistical studies {{over several}} {{recent years and}} large populations of {{institutional}} trade data have revealed {{that the cost of}} executing and clearing institutional trades is between 1.25 and 1.65 <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share.</b> Most institutional advisors pay between 3 and 5 <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> commissions to their brokers. Many of these institutional fiduciaries provide no disclosure of what [...] "services" [...] they are receiving for the excess over their fully negotiated commission rate. In bundled full service brokerage arrangements this lack of disclosure is particularly problematic because it makes it difficult to apply Section 28(e) tests and measure Section 28(e) compliance.|$|E

2500|$|Cash {{dividends}} are {{the most}} common form of payment and are paid out in currency, usually via electronic funds transfer or a printed paper check. Such dividends are a form of investment income and are usually taxable to the recipient in the year they are paid. This is the most common method of sharing corporate profits with the shareholders of the company. For each share owned, a declared amount of money is distributed. Thus, if a person owns 100 shares and the cash dividend is 50 <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share,</b> the holder of the stock will be paid $50.

2500|$|The first {{money market}} mutual fund {{to break the}} buck was First Multifund for Daily Income (FMDI) in 1978, liquidating and restating NAV at 94 <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> <b>share.</b> [...] An {{argument}} has been made that FMDI was not technically a money market fund as at the time of liquidation the average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two years. [...] However, prospective investors were informed that FMDI would invest [...] "solely in Short-Term (30-90 days) MONEY MARKET obligations." [...] Furthermore, the rule restricting which the maturities which money market funds are permitted to invest in, Rule 2-a7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, was not promulgated until 1983. Prior to the adoption of this rule, a mutual fund had to do little other than present itself as a money market fund, which FMDI did. [...] Seeking higher yield, FMDI had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities, and rising interest rates negatively impacted the value of its portfolio. [...] In order to meet increasing redemptions, the fund was forced to sell a certificate of deposit at a 3% loss, triggering a restatement of its NAV and the first instance of a money market fund [...] "breaking the buck".|$|E
