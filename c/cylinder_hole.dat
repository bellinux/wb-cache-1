5000|$|The K-tool {{is a tool}} used by many fire {{departments}} for forcible entry. [...] It is {{used in conjunction with}} a Halligan bar and a flat-headed axe or maul (commonly referred to as [...] "irons" [...] or (with a maul instead of an axe) [...] "strong irons") to remove a cylinder lock. It consists of a steel block roughly 3 inches by 3 inches by 1 inch thick with a K-shaped notch on one side, having sharp edges that grip the cylinder, and a U-shaped flange on the other side. The notch is slipped over the lock cylinder, then forced down by striking with the flat side of the axe or maul. The halligan is then inserted into the flange and used to pry the K-tool off the door, thereby pulling the entire key cylinder out. The bolt is then retracted from the inside of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>hole</b> using a turning tool, such as a screwdriver.|$|E
40|$|The {{radiative}} {{heat transfer}} in a complex two-dimensional enclosure with obstacles with participating medium {{is very important in}} practical engineering applications. In order to deal with this problem, in this study the nite-volume method (FVM) for radiation has been derived using the unstructured grid system. A general discretization equation was formulated by introducing the directional weight and the step scheme for spatial differencing. For its comparison and validation, two test cases, an equilateral triangular enclosure and a square enclosure with baf e, were chosen. Then, more complex and practical cases, such as a semicircular enclosure with <b>cylinder</b> <b>hole,</b> a square enclosure with nned internal cylinder, and a furnace with embedded cooling pipes, were investigated. All the results obtained by the unstructured FVM agreed very well with the exact solutions as well as the results obtained by the zone method. Furthermore, the wiggling behavior occurring in the blocked-of f FVM was not produced by the unstructured FVM. Three types of manipulation of control angle overlap were also examined here. It was found that the solutions depended on the type of manipulation of control angle overlap, especially when the number of control angles was small. Usually, both the pixelation method and exact treatment introduced here yielded better solutions than the bold approximation...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} Model 29 was {{superseded by}} the Model 29-1 in 1960, with modifications {{made to the}} ejector-rod screw. The Model 29-2 replaced it the following year, with one screw that had secured the cylinder-stop spring being deleted. The barrel length was shortened from 6 1/2" [...] to 6" [...] in 1979. These two versions are known as [...] "pinned and recessed". [...] "Pinned" [...] means that the barrels are screwed in, and secured by a pin driven through the frame and a notch in the barrel.

40|$|Parts with a {{functional}} micro contour or a micro structure {{are needed in}} {{a large number of}} applications. Manufacturing process with a geometrically defined cutting edge are usually rare for such applications. Reasons for this are limited dynamics and accuracy of the existing machine tools. An example of use is the compensation of elastic deformations in cylinder crankcases due to fastening of cylinder head bolts during theirs assembly and general operating conditions. Under unoptimized conditions this results in non-circular cylinder bores, also sometimes called a four-leafed clover owing to its similarity. In the state of the art, torque plates are used during the honing operation to compensate the deformations or a novel method - called form honing - is applied. The Fraunhofer IWU developed a piezo-based spindle support for high dynamic positioning of the cutting edge. Thereby it's possible to manufacture non-circular <b>cylinder</b> <b>holes</b> in one of the very first machining operations. This enables a decrease in processing time of cylinder crankcases and in manufacturing more complex and more precise cylinder contours. The spindle support consists of eight high volt piezo actuators in a differential arrangement around a flexure, in whom the spindle is fastened. The flexure itself allows three degrees of freedom (jx, jy, z) for displacement of the HSC-spindle. Depending on tool length, displacements of the tool center point up to ± 60 ìm were achieved and four-leafed clover shaped cylinder bores were manufactured at speeds up to 6000 rpm...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this thesis is the {{development}} of interlocking <b>cylinder</b> and <b>hole</b> microstructures as mechanical and microfluidic interconnect between microchannel containing substrates to form complex microfluidic systems. Interconnects composed of various compliant polymer cylinders and silicon or polymer holes are analysed with ANSYS to optimise interconnect design for mechanical assembly and disassembly forces, as well as fluidic properties, including pressure, dead volume, and fluid flow. Interconnects are fabricated in SU- 8 photopolymer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and in-house fabricated electro-ferromagnetic composites using PDMS and iron beads. Mating structures are experimentally verified for utilisation as microfluidic interconnect between microchannel containing substrates. Their disassembly forces are experimentally tested and range from 20 - 130 mN. Enclosed microchannels with integrated interconnect made in PDMS are also simulated, fabricated, and fluidically tested to 148 kPa at 1 mL/min as an example fluidic component for microinstrumentation.
