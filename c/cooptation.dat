500|$|Released to {{negative}} reviews, Cyberpunk polarised the internet {{communities of the}} period. Detractors viewed it {{as an act of}} <b>cooptation</b> and opportunistic commercialisation. It was also seen as part of a process that saw the overuse of the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] until the word lost meaning. Alternatively, supporters saw Idol's efforts as harmless and well-intentioned, and were encouraged by his new interest in cyberculture.|$|E
2500|$|But Pharaoh is par {{excellence}} a political novel. Its young protagonist, Prince Ramses (who is 22 {{years old at}} the novel's opening), learns that those who would oppose the priesthood are vulnerable to <b>cooptation,</b> seduction, subornation, defamation, intimidation or assassination. Perhaps the chief lesson, belatedly absorbed by Ramses as pharaoh, is the importance, to power, of knowledge — of [...] science.|$|E
2500|$|According to Swiss law, the ICRC {{is defined}} as a private association. Contrary to popular belief, the ICRC is not a {{non-governmental}} organization in the most common sense of the term, nor is it an international organization. As it limits its members (a process called <b>cooptation)</b> to Swiss nationals only, it does not have a policy of open and unrestricted membership for individuals like other legally defined NGOs. The word [...] "international" [...] in its name does not refer to its membership but to the worldwide scope of its activities as defined by the Geneva Conventions. The ICRC has special privileges and legal immunities in many countries, based on national law in these countries or through agreements between the Committee and respective national governments.|$|E
2500|$|Since Israeli {{electoral law}} forbids any {{organization}} calling {{to abolish the}} Jewish character {{of the state to}} take part in the Knesset elections, Abnaa al-Balad boycotts what it calls the [...] "Zionist electoral process". Ibrahim Makkawi, a member of the movement and professor of Educational Psychology, explained this position further in a paper presented at the Third North American Student Conference on the Palestine Solidarity Movement at Rutgers University in October 2003, stating:We refuse to enter the Zionist Knesset, simply because it is (a) in direct contradiction with our national identity as the legitimate owners of the land, (b) it gives legitimacy to the Zionist Entity and support to its myth about democracy, (c) it is a vehicle of <b>cooptation</b> and fragmentation of our leadership and (d) there is virtually nothing that we can achieve through the Knesset with regard to our citizens rights that we cannot do without it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the ICRC {{is not a}} {{sovereign}} entity like the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and also {{it is not an}} international organization, neither of non-governmental nor of governmental type. The ICRC limits its membership to Swiss nationals only, and also [...] it does not have a policy of open and unrestricted membership for individuals as its new members are selected by the Committee itself (a process called <b>cooptation).</b> However, since the early 1990s, the ICRC employs persons {{from all over the world}} to serve in its field mission and at Headquarters. In 2007, almost half of ICRC staff was non-Swiss. The ICRC has special privileges and legal immunities in many countries, based on national law in these countries, based on agreements between the ICRC and the respective governments, or, in some cases, based on international jurisprudence (such as the right of ICRC delegates not to bear witness in front of international tribunals).|$|E
2500|$|Such {{developments}} {{were not}} {{reflected in the}} Russian-controlled Bessarabia. The Russification policy of the regime, more successful among the higher strata of the society, {{did not have an}} important effect on the majority of rural Moldavians. As Romanian politician Take Ionescu noted at the time, [...] "the Romanian landlords were Russified through a policy of <b>cooptation,</b> the government allowing them to maintain leading positions in the administration of the province, whereas the peasantry was indifferent to the national problem: there were no schools for de-nationalization, and, although the church service was held in Russian, this was actually of little significance" [...] Furthermore, as University of Bucharest lecturer Cristina Petrescu noted, Bessarabia missed [...] "the reforms aimed at transforming the two united principalities [...] into a modern state" [...] Irina Livezeanu claims that, moreover, {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, peasants in all regions of the former principality of Moldavia were more likely to identify as Moldavians than the inhabitants of the cities.|$|E
2500|$|... "They {{see that}} the {{dominant}} feminist paradigm {{is based on an}} unacknowledged model of centre and periphery. In this model, Indigenous, African-descendent, and poor women occupy the periphery and must accept the ideas and conceptualization of feminism as defined by those at the centre. In other words, we Indigenous women are expected to accept the dominant picture of what constitutes women's oppression and women's liberation. [...] The trouble is, this picture is only a partial match with our own experiences. Elements of our experience that do not match this picture are denied or marginalized. This dominant model tries to homogenize the women's movement, claiming that all women have the same demands and the same access to the enjoyment of their rights. This flawed assumption denies the diverse cultural, linguistic and social needs and visions of distinct groups of women."Indigenous Feminist scholars have resisted the <b>cooptation</b> and exploitation of their scholarship as another result of colonialism. As a collective, various Indigenous feminist scholars have called for [...] "the profound need for transparency and responsibility in light of the traumatic histories of colonization, slavery, and genocide that shape the present" [...] in order to ensure Indigenous feminism is informed by decolonization.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cooptation</b> is a cognitive-communicative {{operation}} whereby a {{piece of}} text, such as a clause, a phrase, a word, or any other unit, is inserted in a sentence.

50|$|Sentence Grammar is {{organized}} {{in terms of}} propositional concepts and clauses and their combination while Thetical Grammar concerns the linguistic discourse beyond the sentence. While being in principle separate domains, the two interact in various ways in organizing linguistic discourse, and the main way of interaction is via <b>cooptation.</b> <b>Cooptation</b> is fully productive, that is, it can be employed by speakers any time to structure speech. As long as the hearer {{can be expected to}} construct a reasonable hypothesis on the relevance of the coopted unit to the utterance concerned there are few restrictions on what form the coopted unit may take and where it can be placed in its host construction.|$|E

5000|$|While being {{separate}} in principle, thetical grammar interacts {{in multiple}} ways with sentence grammar in shaping linguistic discourse.

50|$|Membership was in {{principle}} {{a question of}} uitverkiezing (<b>cooptation)</b> and inheritance. Family ties were very important, but also good breeding and social status. Vroedmannen had to satisfy two conditions: membership of the Calvinist church and the possession of a house. Although city administrations, by present standards, were more oligarchic than meritocratic, family ties never formed a formal legal basis for election.|$|E

50|$|Historically, the {{organized}} labor (largely {{tied to the}} Justicialist Party) and the armed forces have also played significant roles in national life. Labor's political power was significantly weakened by free market reforms during the 1990s, {{as well as the}} <b>cooptation</b> of its leaders by the Menem administration. They now seem to be returning to their former position, since the current government focuses on a productive model with local industry {{as one of the top}} priorities.|$|E
5000|$|The IWW's {{opposition}} to the war led to enmity and, reportedly, behind the scenes attacks from the AFL's Samuel Gompers. In 1919, the year {{after the end of the}} war, the AFL seemed to have second thoughts, concluding that works committees of the war years were [...] "a snare and a <b>cooptation</b> plan." [...] Unfortunately by this time, many IWW leaders had been deported or were in prison for the IWW's anti-war pronouncements.|$|E
50|$|Elbers, {{when taking}} the {{decision}} to refocus his activities on making television programs, left the board, since this {{would not have been}} compatible with a mandate in the board of the BRTN.

However, more recently, civil society organizations have expanded and changed profoundly. While continuing to play an important role in the defense of human rights, in many countries civil society has become a vehicle for political parties, individual politicians, unions and social movements to channel public funds for their own benefit and/or political <b>cooptation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The city council, {{in early}} times {{supposedly}} elected by male citizens, {{had turned into}} an autocratic body restaffing its vacancies by <b>coöptation.</b> The system of coöptating seats was prone to corruption and it came to several major struggles in the following decades. The first relevant document organising power and tasks of citizenry and the city council (government), which was traditionally dominated by the local merchants, dates back to 1410 and is named Erster Rezess (roughly: The first Settlement, literally the agreement reached before parting recedere of the negotiating partners).|$|E
50|$|Vulnerability is a {{universal}} aspect of the human condition, arising from our embodiment and our location within society and its institutions. On the individual level, vulnerability refers to the ever-present possibility of harm, injury or biological impairment or limitation. As human creations, institutions also are vulnerable to capture, <b>cooptation</b> and corruption. Vulnerability also is generative and presents opportunities for innovation and growth, creativity and fulfillment. As embodied and vulnerable beings, we experience feelings such as love, respect, curiosity, amusement and desire that make us reach out to others, form relationships and build institutions.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{movements}} may {{be affected}} by oligarchization, when a class of individuals within the movement work to ensure {{the maintenance of the}} movement itself rather than a continual push for collective goals, or <b>cooptation,</b> when outside support is garnered for the movement {{at the same time as}} it is forced to sacrifice its goals to meet the demands of these supporting institutions. This in turn may lead to the loss of indigenous support, and along with it many of the supporting grassroots organizations that were able to quickly mobilize members at the onset of the movement.|$|E
50|$|In 1844 the Senate of Hamburg, the {{executive}} {{government of the}} city-state, coöpted Haller as fellow senator. As a senator Haller engaged in the debate on and reform of the Hamburg constitution. Under the new constitution of 1860 the senate reformed too in 1861. The new constitution provided for the election of senators by the Hamburg Parliament, doing away with the senate's prior <b>coöptation.</b> Haller {{was one of the}} pre-reform senators who remained in office. After 1860 he was a successful senator of finance presiding over the deputation of finances (Finanzdeputation), a joint commission of burghers and officials competent for the city-state's budget.|$|E
50|$|Lucius Flaccus was flamen Martialis when he died, {{sometime}} after the <b>cooptation</b> of Julius Caesar to the pontifical college in 73 {{and before that}} of the P. Sulpicius Galba who was praetor around 66. The year Flaccus acquired the priesthood is undetermined. The iconography of coinage he issued as monetalis in 108 or 107 BC includes a flamen's distinctive cap. His father also had served as the high priest of Mars, and the image may refer to this heritage; since sons often succeeded fathers in religious office, it's possible that the coin also {{marks the beginning of}} his own priesthood.|$|E

5000|$|He wrote theses on Hong Kong society, {{including}} The Administrative Absorption of Politics in Hong Kong (1975), which {{argued that}} the British <b>cooptation</b> of local elites would lead to [...] "synarchy",a form of joint rule; Social Life and Development in Hong Kong (1985); The Special Character of Hong Kong's Polity and its Democratic Prospects (1987); One Country, Two Systems: An Idea on Trial (1995); and Hong Kong: A City with the Most Traits of Modernity in Chinese Societies (2000). He held that to understand Hong Kong, one cannot overlook two important threads, namely, colonial rule and capitalism. He is famous for the administrative absorption politics model (行政吸納政治) he introduced in 1975.|$|E
