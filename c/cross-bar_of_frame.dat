60|$|Morning {{found the}} man haggard and worn, wide-eyed from want of sleep. He cooked {{breakfast in the}} darkness, and at nine o'clock, when, {{with the coming of}} daylight, the wolf-pack drew back, he set about the task he had planned through the long hours of the night. Chopping down young saplings, he made them <b>cross-bars</b> <b>of</b> a {{scaffold}} by lashing them high up to the trunks of standing trees.

5|$|Forty {{years earlier}} than de Tournefort, de Thévenot {{described}} {{much the same}} process, adding that it was seldom used because it was regarded as too cruel. Some 80 years prior to de Thevenot, in 1579, Hans Jacob Breuning von Buchenbach witnessed {{a variant of the}} gaunching ritual. A large iron hook was fixed on the horizontal <b>cross-bar</b> <b>of</b> the gallows and the individual was forced upon this hook, piercing him from the abdomen through his back, so that he hung from it, hands, feet and head downward. On top of the cross bar, the executioner situated himself and performed various torture on the impaled man below him.|$|R

50|$|The cross/star symbol {{represents}} the solar sign, a protective symbol {{that according to}} folklore protects man from misfortunes. The cross does not overlap the black and red stripes, and its size is such that it fits within a square whose side is equal to 5/6 of the width {{of one of the}} vertical stripes of the flag. The width of the vertical and horizontal <b>cross-bars</b> <b>of</b> the solar sign is equal to one third of the side of this imaginary square. Each arm ends with two symmetrical teeth, the internal sides of which form a 90 degree angle where they meet, a vertex deepened towards the center of the sign at 1/2 arm width.|$|R
60|$|Rafts.--Rafts of Wood.--Rafts {{are made}} of logs of wood, held {{together}} by pairs <b>of</b> <b>cross-bars,</b> one <b>of</b> each pair lying above the raft and the other below; then, the whole may be made quite firm by a little judicious notching wherethe logs cross, and a few pegs and lashings. Briers, woodbines, etc., will do for these. If the logs are large, they should be separately launched into the river, and towed into their proper places. Outriggers vastly increase the stability of a raft. The raft-fastening in common use is shown in f. 1: it is a stout, little wand, bent over the cross piece, and wedged into holes in the framework.|$|R

He then went to the other end <b>of</b> the same <b>cross-bar,</b> bored a hole there, and put a nail in, driving it as far as he had driven the first one. This was the topmost <b>cross-bar</b> <b>of</b> the ladder, and it was held {{securely}} in its place by the two nails. Stuyvesant then took the bottom cross-bar and secured that in the same way. Then he put on the other bars one at a time, until his ladder was complete in form, only the cross-bars were not yet fully nailed. He and Phonny looked at it carefully, to see if all was right, and Stuyvesant, taking it up from the floor, placed it {{against the wall of the}} shop.|$|R

40|$|One {{approach}} {{to ease the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> is to first construct local components and then build a global frame from these. In this paper we will show {{that the study of}} the relation between a frame and its local components leads to the definition <b>of</b> a <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> subspaces. We introduce this new notion and prove that it provides us with the link we need. It will also turn out that <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces behave as a generalization <b>of</b> <b>frames.</b> In particular, we can define an analysis, a synthesis and a frame operator for a <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> subspaces, which even yield a reconstruction formula. Also concepts such as completeness, minimality, and exactness are introduced and investigated. We further study several constructions <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces, and also <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> and Riesz frames using the theory <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces. An important special case are harmonic <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces which generalize harmonic frames. We show that wavelet subspaces coming from multiresolution analysis belong to this class.

Then supporting this ladder-shaped framework over the sick man as he lies in his blanket, knot the blanket up well to it, and so carry him off palanquin-fashion. One cross-bar will be just behind his head, another in front of his feet; the middle one will cross his stomach, and keep him from falling out; and there will remain two short handles for the carriers to lay hold of. The American Indians carry their wounded companions by this contrivance after a fight, and during a hurried retreat, for wonderful distances. A king of waggon-roof top can easily be made to it, with bent boughs and one spare blanket. (See Palanquin.) ...|$|R
