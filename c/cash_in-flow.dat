40|$|Business firm's {{income is}} not constant, or fixed from period to period {{because of this}} firm’s cash inflow or out flow is uneven. The {{decision}} of a firm either to invest or to borrow from creditors based on uneven <b>cash</b> <b>in-flow</b> {{need to have a}} future or a present value prediction formula. The problem to find future and present value formulae for uneven cash flow stayed unsolved for long periods. However, on this paper it wanted to show future and present value of uneven cash flow prediction formulae based on the performance rate (Pn) of a business. The Performance rate (Pn) is a percentage by which the current performance, economic value added (EVAn), of the business exceeds the previous performance. Therefore, the firm cash out flows either for investment or for repayment of the borrowed loan growth according to the performance rate (p) of the fir...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In practice, {{a project}} usually {{involves}} cash in- and outflows {{associated with each}} activity. This paper aims to minimize the payment failure risk during the project execution for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). In such models, the money-time value, which {{is the product of}} the net <b>cash</b> <b>in-flow</b> and the time length from the completion time of each activity to the project deadline, provides a financial evaluation of project cash availability. The cash availability of a project schedule is defined as the sum of these money-time values associated with all activities, which is mathematically equivalent to the minimization objective of total weighted completion time. This paper presents four memetic algorithms (MAs) which differ in the construction of initial population and restart strategy, and a double variable neighborhood search algorithm for solving the RCPSP problem. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of these algorithms based on the same number of solutions calculated using ProGen generated benchmark instances. The results indicate that the MAs with regret biased sampling rule to generate initial and restart populations outperforms the other algorithms in terms of solution quality.

50|$|The {{result of}} this formula is multiplied with the Annual Net <b>cash</b> <b>in-flows</b> and reduced by Initial Cash outlay the present value but {{in cases where the}} cash flows are not equal in amount, then the {{previous}} formula will be used to determine the present value of each cash flow separately. Any cash flow within 12 months will not be discounted for NPV purpose, nevertheless the usual initial investments during the first year R0 are summed up a negative cash flow.|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an answer to}} the question of how much cash deposited via a financial institution can be traced back to criminal activities, by developing a new approach to measure money laundering and proposing an application to Italy. We define a model of <b>cash</b> <b>in-flows</b> on current accounts considering, besides "dirty money" to be laundered, also the legal motivations to deposit cash and the role of the shadow economy. We find that the average amount of cash laundered in Italy is around 6 % of GDP. These findings are coherent with estimates of the nonobserved economy obtained in previous studies...|$|R
40|$|Anti–money {{laundering}} {{regulations have}} been centred on the “Know-Your-Customer” rule so far, overlooking {{the fact that}} criminal proceedings {{that need to be}} laundered are usually represented by cash. This is the first study which tries to provide an {{answer to the question of}} how much of cash deposited via an official financial institution can be traced back to criminal activities. The paper develops a new approach to measure money laundering and then proposes an application to Italy, a country where cash is still widely used in transactions and criminal activities generate significant proceeds. In particular, we define a model of <b>cash</b> <b>in-flows</b> on current accounts and proxy money laundering with two indicators for the diffusion of criminal activities related to both illegal trafficking and extortion, controlling also for structural (legal) motivations to deposit cash, as well as the need to conceal proceeds from tax evasion. Using a panel of 91 Italian provinces observed over the period 2005 - 2008, we find that the average total size of money laundering is sizable, around 7...|$|R
