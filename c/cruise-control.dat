50|$|The new {{dashboard}} {{and controls}} were smaller with better quality and appearance. In the Berlinetta, the standard instrument cluster {{was replaced by}} electronic readouts, including a bar-graph tachometer and digital speedometer. The new dash came with an overhead console and pod-mounted controls for turn signals, <b>cruise-control,</b> HVAC, windshield wiper, and headlights. The radio was mounted inside a pod on the console that could swivel toward the driver or passenger.|$|E
50|$|Gibson {{would be}} on <b>cruise-control</b> the {{remainder}} of the game while the Cards would add two more runs off reliever Jerry Stephenson in the third. Cepeda would double into the left-field corner and move to third on a wild pitch. McCarver would add a second RBI on a sac-fly to center scoring Cepeda. Shannon would walk and score on a Juli√°n Javier double just inside the third-base line. That would be it for the scoring as Gibson would win his second Series game, a five-hit complete-game that put his Cardinals up, three games to one.|$|E
50|$|The GL1500I '91 model had {{its weight}} and price cut by {{eliminating}} the reverse gear, <b>cruise-control,</b> the passenger footboards, and by replacing the audio system with a small Kenwood radio. The seat was lowered by 0.8 in. Claimed dry weight for the 1991 Interstate was 760 lb and it cost $9,000. In 1992 the Kenwood radio was, in turn, replaced by a new Panasonic 25-watt-per-channel sound system with intercom. Weight for the GL1500I '92 rose slightly to 767 lb and its price to $9,200. The Intersate had a 1993 price increase to $9,600 and then again to $10,000 for 1994.|$|E
50|$|The third {{generation}} Japanese-built Odyssey {{was the first}} full redesign of the Odyssey since its introduction in 1994. Going on sale in Japan in October 2003, and in Australia and many other countries from early 2004, it continued with a 5-door body style, with a much sleeker, lower, and more car-like appearance. For the first time <b>cruise-control</b> appeared on the JDM Odyssey. The 4WD version has received the new DPS system. The seat folding mechanism was changed again. The height of the new Odyssey was lower than ever - designed with multi-level parking in mind, particularly for Japan. The new Odyssey came with the Honda K24A i-VTEC engine, a 2.4 L unit producing 160 hp (119 kW); {{this was the same}} engine used in the CR-V and Accord. A 4WD version (RB2) came only with an automatic transmission, while the 2WD version came only with a continuously variable transmission, except Absolute, JDB S/B model as well as export models. The V6 engine was dropped completely. Instead, a 200 hp (149 kW) variant of the K24A engine was adopted for the sporty Absolute version (190 hp (142 kW) with 4WD), which was only equipped with an automatic transmission - both the 2WD & 4WD variants. Moreover, this new engine had the same fuel consumption as the old 2.2 engine. All this resulted in the new Odyssey becoming a sales success. In Australia, the Odyssey achieved its best-ever sales year in 2005, and outsold the Toyota Tarago for the first time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. PLC {{is widely}} applied to <b>cruise-control</b> system owing to its merits. With the {{development}} of transducers, servo-control and step-by-step control system, PLC plays {{a greater role in}} accurate positioning. Combining with PC and touch screen, this kind of controller becomes more convenient in human-computer interface and management. The three-dimensional <b>cruise-control</b> system designed in this paper uses PLC to control transducers as to ensure the start-stop stability in transverse shift and uses stepping motor to make sure the accurate positioning in longitudinal shift. And this system utilizes servo-motor to make vertical lifting easy. Then it is expedient and flexible to achieve the remote control by PC or touch screen. System Configuration This system, known as three-dimensional cruise-driving, consists of longitudinal shift subsystem, transverse shift and vertical lifting subsystems. Longitudinal Shift Subsystems (for carts). This subsystem adopts AC frequency-conversion electric drive in which the driving motor is three phase asynchronous reduction motor and transducer selects Siemens Micro Master 440 Inverter with power of 0. 37 KW. In both sides of tracks there are optoelectronic switch where signals enter to PLC and participate in control an...|$|E
40|$|Interactive {{investigation}} of an industrial case-study is addressed, through the utilisation of multimedia presentation technology. A principal {{aim is to}} evaluate results through interactive interrogation, covering industrial requirements to identify optimal operating windows through parameter adjustment. Both steady and transient simulated flow-states are evaluated. The data is interpreted, utilising the MMS to navigate through the large data-set involved. Flow settings and results are discussed, whilst innovative presentation techniques are described and implemented through multimedia environments. World-wide-web delivery, streaming, underlying graphs, data-compression, voiceover and availability of <b>cruise-control</b> navigation, are multimedia-related features that can render the current system accessible to wide audiences over the internet. The generality of presentation methods classifies this case-study as a characteristic example, to be adopted for alternative data-sets. ...|$|E
40|$|The tuning of a PI {{controller}} {{is usually}} done through simulation, except for few classes of problems, e. g., linear systems. With {{a new approach}} for validated integration allowing us to simulate dynamical systems with uncertain parameters, {{we are able to}} design guaranteed PI controllers. In practical, we propose a new method to identify the parameters of a PI controller for non-linear plants with bounded uncertain parameters using tools from interval analysis and validated simulation. This work relies on interval computation and guaranteed numerical integration of ordinary differential equations based on Runge-Kutta methods. Our method is applied to the well-known <b>cruise-control</b> problem, under a simplified linear version and with the aerodynamic force taken into account leading to a non-linear formulation...|$|E
40|$|System {{specification}} {{and design}} consists of describing a system's desired functionality, and of mapping that functionality for implementation {{on a set}} of system components, such as processors, ASIC's, memories, and buses. In this article, we describe the key problems of system specification and design, including specification capture, design exploration, hierarchical modeling, software and hardware synthesis, and cosimulation. We highlight existing tools and methods for solving those problems, and we discuss issues that remain to be solved. 1 Introduction Embedded systems have become commonplace in recent years. Examples include automobile <b>cruise-control,</b> fuel-injection systems, aircraft autopilots, telecommunication products, interactive television processors, network switches, video focusing units, robot controllers, and numerous medical devices. While there is no widespread agreement of what defines an embedded system, we note that such systems possess a few key characteristics. Th [...] ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDespite the {{high-level}} of automation, the practicability of model-checking large asynchronous {{models is}} hindered by the state-space explosion problem. To address this challenge the Context-aware Verification technique {{relies on the}} identification and explicit specification of the environment (context) in which the system-under-study operates. In this paper we apply this technique for the verification of a <b>Cruise-control</b> System (CCS). The asynchrony of this system renders traditional model-checking approaches almost impossible. Using the Context-aware Verification technique this task becomes manageable by relying on two powerful optimisation strategies enabled by the structural properties of the contexts: automatic context-splitting, a recursive state-space decomposition strategy; context-directed semi-external reachability analysis, an exhaustive analysis technique that reduces the memory pressure during verification {{through the use of}} external memory. In the case of the CCS system, this approach enabled the analysis of up to 5 times larger state-spaces than traditional approaches...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{cooperative}} adaptive <b>cruise-control</b> (CACC) system and its practical validation are presented. Focusing on the feasibility of implementation, a decentralized controller design with a limited communication structure is proposed (in this case, a wireless communication link with the nearest preceding vehicle only). A necessary and sufficient frequency-domain condition for string stability is derived, taking into account heterogeneous traffic, i. e., vehicles with possibly different characteristics. For a velocity-dependent intervehicle spacing policy, it is shown that the wireless communication link enables driving at small intervehicle distances, whereas string stability is guaranteed. For a constant velocity-independent intervehicle spacing, string stability cannot be guaranteed. To validate the theoretical results, experiments are performed with two CACC-equipped vehicles. Implementation of the CACC system, the string-stability characteristics of the practical setup, and experimental results are discussed, indicating {{the advantages of the}} design over standard adaptive-cruise-control functionality. ¬© 2006 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} optimization {{of software}} control strategy for eliminating ‚Äúhitching " and ‚Äúringing ‚Äù in a diesel engine powertrain. Slow- and high-amplitude oscillation {{of the entire}} vehicle powertrain under steady pedal position at idle is called "ringing, " and similar behavior under <b>cruise-control</b> conditions is called "hitching. " The intermittent nature of these conditions posed a particular challenge in arriving at proper design alternatives. Zero-point-proportional dynamic S/N ratio was used to quantify vibration and tracking accuracy under six driving conditions, which represented noise factors. An L 18 orthogonal array explored combinations of six software strategy control factors associated with controlling fuel delivery to the engine. The result was between 4 and 10 dB improvement in vibration reduction, resulting in virtual elimination of the hitching condition. As {{a result of this}} effort, a 12 repair per thousand vehicle reliability (eight million dollar warranty) problem was eliminated. The Robust Design methodology developed in this application may be used for a variety of applications to optimize similar feedback control strategies...|$|E
