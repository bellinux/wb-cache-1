With {{a minimum of}} 99.99% aluminum, it is the purest and least alloyed of the <b>commercial</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloys. It is soft and unsuitable for machining. At the same time, it possesses excellent corrosion resistance, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity.

50|$|In typical <b>commercial</b> <b>aluminium</b> {{anodizing}} processes, the {{aluminium oxide}} is grown {{down into the}} surface and out from the surface by equal amounts. So anodizing will increase the part dimensions on each surface by half the oxide thickness. For example, a coating that is 2 μm thick will increase the part dimensions by 1 μm per surface. If the part is anodized on all sides, then all linear dimensions will increase by the oxide thickness. Anodized aluminium surfaces are harder than aluminium but have low to moderate wear resistance, although this can be improved with thickness and sealing.|$|E

The core of the construction employed <b>commercial</b> <b>aluminium</b> ladders in the fuselage and as spars in both wings. The wings were assembled using styrofoam ribs, and were fabric-covered.

After test hops and modifications, on 26 June 1999, Daniel Dalby piloted the Pouchel on its first true flight at Salon Eyguieres.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — {{over the}} last few years a lot of {{research}} has been going on in the area of Friction Stir Welding and Friction Stir Processing (FSP). FSP has developed as a new processing technique to improve the surface characteristics of materials especially Aluminium. In this research we have tried to improve the surface properties, mainly corrosion resistance of Aluminium alloy AA 6061 by using an external filler plate during the FSP. A thin sheet of <b>commercial</b> <b>Aluminium</b> was coated on the AA 6061 base plate with the help of FSP technique. Different combinations of process parameters like tool speed and plunge depth along with various external cooling modes and backing plates were tested to optimize the process. FSP was also carried out on weld zones of fusion welded samples. Later the processed samples were subjected to various tests like salt spray corrosion test, grain size measurement etc. The test results show that the coating of <b>commercial</b> <b>Aluminium</b> plate did improve the corrosion resistance considerably...|$|E

40|$|The {{aluminium}} alloys for electrical conductivity applications {{are generally not}} grain refinedsince the addition of grain refiners drops the electrical conductivity by introducing impuritiesinto the melt. Non-grain refined aluminium may lead to bar fracture and cracks during themetalworking process. The present study focuses to find an optimum balance between the grain refiner addition andthe electrical conductivity of commercial EC grade 1070 aluminium alloy for electricalapplication. In order to reach this goal, the electrical conductivity and the macrostructure ofcommercial EC grade 1070 <b>aluminium</b> (<b>commercial</b> pure <b>aluminium)</b> have been studiedunder a series of controlled lab scale trails. Specific addition levels of different grain refiners(TiBloy, Al- 5 Ti- 1 B, Al- 3 Ti- 0. 15 C, and Al- 3 Ti- 1 B) {{were added to the}} metal melt and sampleswere taken at specific time intervals. The collected samples were sectioned, ground andmacro-etched. Thereafter, the macrostructure was analysed by the use of a digital camera andthe electrical conductivity was measured at temperature. The obtained result was expressed asa percentage of the International Annealed Copper Standard (IACS %). The macro-structuralanalysis showed that TiBloy, Al- 5 Ti- 1 B, and Al- 3 Ti- 1 B, with the maximum addition level of 0. 1 %, cannot grin refine <b>commercial</b> pure <b>aluminium.</b> However, at higher grain refiner levelsthe number of columnar grains increased and their size decreased. The Al- 3 Ti- 0. 15 C master alloy, with the same addition level as the once chosen for the othergrain refiners (up to 0. 1 %), showed significantly better grain refining. By the addition of 0. 1 % of this grain refiner the macrostructure became very equiaxed already after 30 minutesof grain refiner addition. The fading of the Al- 3 Ti- 0. 15 master alloy was, however, observedfor samples with a long holding time. Nevertheless, by maximum addition level (0. 1 %) and a 90 minutes holding time the macrostructure remained as equiaxed grains. The electrical conductivity results showed that none of the applied grain refiners (TiBloy, Al- 5 Ti- 1 B, Al- 3 Ti- 0. 15 C, and Al- 3 Ti- 1 B), with the maximum addition level of 0. 1 %, decreasedthe electrical conductivity of <b>commercial</b> pure <b>aluminium...</b>|$|R
