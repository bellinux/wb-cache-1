40|$|Subject of {{analysis}} and elaboration {{in this paper}} is the market of corporate <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>takeover</b> {{as one of the}} instruments of internal governance companies. The market for corporate control (external corporate control), together with market products, goods, capital and services is a special feature of the market economy. Overall, the market for corporate control is developed as a fourth type of market where trading with stocks capital takes place on a large scale, and which contributes to the change in control over the companies. Expansion of the market for corporate control {{is directly related to the}} internal management of companies, regarding the work and responsibility of the management of companies. Possibility of takeover and establishing control of companies (public takeover offer companies - friendly and hostile takeover), is treated as one of the most powerful instruments for the control of management body. Statutory amendments generally, and especially the acquisition is an important control tool in the allocation of corporate control. Takeover allows changing of inefficient members against their will. Moreover, the very threat of takeover affects the behavior of members of the Board of Directors. Because of this, the effective market for corporate control is a prerequisite for effective management system. Takeover issue is particularly important in many ways. Regarding management body, the acquisition is treated as desirable or undesirable instrument. The latter is determined by whether it is a friendly or a hostile takeover of the company. From the shareholders point of view, offer for public takeover always puts them in a privileged position, which often generates numerous and heterogeneous shareholders fluctuations. This is a case when it’s a question of dispersed shareholder structure, which creates conditions for application of concept of "prisoner’s dilemma" that for management body conditions for preservation of the existing position. Keywords: corporate control, corporate governance, friendly and hostile takeover. ...|$|E

We delineate a relationship between the imperfections in the market for corporate <b>control</b> <b>and</b> the <b>takeover</b> incentives. We character- ize a critical bargaining power below which the compound takeover option is never exercised. This critical threshold is a decreasing function of the expected primary <b>takeover</b> gain <b>and</b> the embedded divestment gain and an increasing function of the implementation uncertainty. With implementation uncertainty the relationship between volatility <b>and</b> <b>takeover</b> timing depends on the functional form of the pro¯t °ow...|$|R

Meanwhile, Tooth & Co., part of the Adelaide Steamship Group, purchased a number of wineries. AdSteam sold its wineries to SA Brewing Holdings in 1990, who then renamed all of its wine holdings [...] "The Penfolds Wines Group", and then in 1994, Southcorp Wines.|$|R
40|$|First {{chapter of}} this thesis {{describes}} {{the formation of}} EU policy on energy and summarizes the current objectives, which should be followed by the European Union {{in the field of}} energy. There are also mentioned the main actors in the European energy market (i. e. markets with electricity and natural gas as the main focus of the thesis). In the second chapter, mergers <b>and</b> <b>takeovers</b> in general <b>and</b> then their <b>control</b> through the EU competition policy is described. Third, i. e. the last chapter is devoted to the possible consequences of mergers <b>and</b> <b>takeovers</b> (especially dominant position and its abuse). The whole chapter and thesis is closed by selected cases of <b>control</b> of mergers <b>and</b> <b>takeovers</b> in the electricity and gas markets...|$|R
25|$|While an {{improvement}} {{on the first}} scheme, the 1982 scheme still presented significant difficulties mainly due to the NCSC delegating administrative functions to state commissions but retaining <b>control</b> of <b>takeovers</b> <b>and</b> policy. This led to funding difficulties and inefficient corporate regulation. Thus, the Commonwealth sought to take sole responsibility for corporations law in Australia.|$|R
40|$|Ownership {{structures}} widely differ {{across the}} EU. While large blockholdings dominate {{in the banking}} sector in Continental Europe, ownership is widely dispersed in the United Kingdom. These differences have consequences for corporate governance in the EU banking sector. This paper analyzes the efficiency of shareholder <b>control</b> <b>and</b> hostile <b>takeovers</b> as corporate governance mechanisms in the EU banking sector {{against the background of}} the regulatory environment and differences in the ownership structure of banks. Particular attention is put on current trends in the ownership structure of banks (e. g. sovereign wealth funds). The paper is based on a new dataset on shareholdings in listed banks in the EU banking sector. The results indicate that EU regulations have not always improved corporate governance in the banking sector. While shareholder control has been improved by a better protection of minority shareholder rights, the efficiency of the takeover market has been reduced in Continental Europe.

This hostility and often vilification, appears less to actual Ottoman policies and more to their state building processes. Doumani’s study of the Arab region of Ottoman Palestine notes, ...most Arab nationalists view the entire Ottoman era as a period of oppressive Turkish rule which stifled Arab culture and socioeconomic development and paved the way for European colonial <b>control</b> <b>and</b> the Zionist <b>takeover</b> of Palestine... The intellectual foundation for this shared image can be traced to the extensive literature published during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by Westerners bent on [...] "discovering," [...] hence reclaiming, the Holy Land from what they believed was a stagnant and declining Ottoman Empire.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the effects of delisting on the {{dynamics}} of value and governance of delisted companies represents a very promising research opportunity for international scholars. This paper addresses a preliminary question, i. e. how, {{in the face of a}} complex phenomenon with a significant number of highly differentiating characteristics, it is possible to avoid the risk that a conjunct observation of operations that differ too much one from the other might raise significant obstacles to the application of the main models of qualitative and/or quantitative analysis. We define a classification framework that deepens the fundamental distinction between voluntary and involuntary delistings. A particular focus is on voluntary delistings, which we differentiate in the light of three main characterising features: i) the subjects who pursue delisting, ii) the underlying strategic context and iii) the operating conditions of the delisted company. Our three-dimensional classification framework defines eight homogeneous areas of observation (pre-sale delistings, hidden potential delistings, <b>control</b> strengthening delistings <b>and</b> <b>takeover</b> delistings, either in balanced operating conditions or in presence of crisis/operating distress) and may be a useful starting point for future studies on the effects of delisting on the dynamics of value and governance of the delisted company...|$|R
50|$|Originally {{known as}} the Toronto, Simcoe and Huron, and then the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron, {{the aim was to}} provide a portage route from the upper Great Lakes at Collingwood to Toronto. The plan for the {{railroad}} was largely executed by Frederick Chase Capreol who was fired as manager of the company the day before the ground broke. Financial difficulties and a government bailout led to a reorganization of the company as the Northern Railway of Canada in 1859. The line saw three major expansions; North Grey Railway extended the original mainline to Meaford, the North Simcoe Railway ran to the port town of Penetanguishene, and the Muskoka Branch ran northeast to Gravenhurst. This last expansion would be the starting point for the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway, connecting to the Canadian Pacific Railway mainline outside of North Bay. In 1887, the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) gained a <b>controlling</b> interest, <b>and</b> the <b>takeover</b> was formalized in January 1888.|$|R
40|$|This paper surveys {{theoretical}} {{arguments and}} empirical {{evidence about the}} contributions of banks and security markets to {{economic growth in the}} European Union. Its financial structure differs from that in the United States. While GDP in the Union is slightly larger, banking assets are three times as large, stock market capitalization is 60 %, and corporate bond debt is 80 % of that in the U. S. These differences are attributed to the greater presence in Europe of universal banking, pyramidal holding companies, and government ownership of banking institutions and other firms. As privatization proceeds, banking assets will continue to be disproportionately large relative to the U. S., because both universal banks and pyramidal holding companies in the context of Roman law institutions reduce the attractiveness of equities. Equities are both a claim on a future stream of net income and a mechanism which can be used to <b>control</b> <b>and</b> restructure through <b>takeovers.</b> The latter is largely miss [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the extent to}} which UK company law <b>and</b> <b>takeover</b> regulation {{may have contributed to the}} supposed short-termism exercised by target directors in takeovers, that is, target directors focusing only on short-term financial gain to the current shareholders, rather than the target’s long-term wealth creation or the interests of other stakeholders. This article argues that general company law <b>and</b> <b>takeover</b> regulation do not mandate target directors to strictly prioritise the short-term financial interests of the company. While company law <b>and</b> <b>takeover</b> regulation require the target board to consider stakeholders’ interests, neither shareholders nor stakeholders have an enforceable right of action against the directors in connection with their failure to do so. This article suggests a partial solution to resolve the enforcement issue in relation to schemes of arrangement, while preserving the existing shareholder-centric model, and addresses the question of whether there is a need for a fundamental overhaul of company law <b>and</b> <b>takeover</b> regulation...|$|R
