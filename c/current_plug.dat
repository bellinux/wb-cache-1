The connectors are specified in British Standard BS 6312. Electrical characteristics of the telephone interface are specified by individual network operators, e.g. in British Telecom's SIN 351. Electrical characteristics required of British telephones used to be specified in BS 6305.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, conservatisms of <b>current</b> <b>plugging</b> {{criteria}} on {{steam generator}} tubes are reviewed and six new failure prediction models for dual through-wall cracks are proposed. In {{order to determine}} the optimum ones among these local or global failure prediction models, a series of plastic collapse tests and corresponding finite element analyses are carried out with respect to two adjacent axial through-wall cracks in thin plates. Then, reaction force model, plastic zone contact model and COD (Crack Opening Displacement) base model were selected as the optimum ones for integrity assessment of steam generator tubes with dual cracks...|$|R
5000|$|A common Direct <b>Current</b> power <b>plug</b> is {{intended}} to make life easier by eliminating the confusion regarding what voltage and current transformer one needs to buy and carry. [...] This can help mobile devices, laptops, many consumer electronic devices, office devices like Ethernet switches/hubs, and wireless routers {{to use the same}} power adapter around the world.|$|R
2500|$|Ir = is {{the ratio}} of the fault current to the relay setting <b>current</b> or a <b>Plug</b> Setting Multiplier. [...] "Plug" [...] is a {{reference}} from the electromechanical relay era and were available in discrete steps. [...] TD is the Time Dial setting.|$|R
50|$|A further form {{of partial}} dual {{ignition}} (such {{as on the}} Honda VT500) is for each cylinder to have a single HT coil which sends the <b>current</b> to one <b>plug</b> and completes the circuit via the second plug, rather than via the earth, the current necessarily jumping two plug gaps.|$|R
50|$|Industrial and {{multiphase}} {{plugs and sockets}} {{provide a}} connection to the electrical mains rated at higher voltages and <b>currents</b> than household <b>plugs</b> and sockets. They are generally used in polyphase systems, with high currents, or when protection from environmental hazards is required. Industrial outlets may have weatherproof covers, waterproofing sleeves, or may be interlocked with a switch to prevent accidental disconnection of an energized plug. Some types of connectors are approved for hazardous areas such as coal mines or petrochemical plants, where flammable gas may be present.|$|R
40|$|The Market Requirement Document for Home Plug AV 2 [1] {{specifies}} {{an important}} increase in datarate, {{compared to the}} <b>current</b> Home <b>Plug</b> AV specifications. A 1 Gbps class PHY layer is requested, leading to a net throughput {{in the order of}} 600 Mbps. One of the most direct ways to increase Home <b>Plug</b> AV <b>current</b> throughput is to increase the frequency band of operation above the current upper frequency of 30 MHz. Currently, {{there is a lack of}} information on the characteristics of the powerline transmission medium at high frequencies. Parameters of interest are the Channel Transfer Function, characterizing the frequency attenuation and multipath nature of the transmission channel, the stationary noise, and the impulsive noise. Thus, there is a need for channel characterization and modelling studies for a better understanding of the physics of transmission above 30 MHz. The result of such studies will serve as an input for the development of robust and efficient signal processing techniques for the Home Plug AV 2 specification...|$|R
5000|$|Specifics of {{this process}} include {{connecting}} one's soul or attention, called Surat (soul) with the inner Current of Light and Sound of God, the Shabd. Adherents believe this Sound Current cannot be heard by the uninitiated; it is made manifest {{at the time of}} initiation. An essential component of the practice involves sitting still with eyes closed, with one's attention focused at the [...] "third eye center", located between and behind the two eyebrows, while (mentally) repeating one or more mantras given by the Guru to the disciple at the time of initiation. This is called simran (repetition) and its primary function is to still the mind while remembering (or being connected to) the Guru via the mantra he provided. However listening to the Sound <b>Current</b> by <b>plugging</b> the ears with the thumbs and listening at the right side or above is equally as important. Sound is considered to be the source of the Light, and to contain everything required.|$|R
5000|$|Within each size group, certain [...] "lugs" [...] on {{the outside}} of the <b>plugs</b> of higher <b>current</b> rating prevent a plug rated for a higher current being {{installed}} into a socket outlet rated for a lower <b>current.</b> However, a <b>plug</b> rated for a lower current can be installed into a socket outlet of the same size group rated for a higher current. For example, a 32-A 4-pin plug without neutral can plug into a 50-A 5-pin socket with neutral available. However a 10-A 5-pin plug cannot fit a 32-A 5-pin socket, as the plugs are different diameters.|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{investigations}} {{have been conducted}} {{on a set of}} four pilot scale subsurface flow (SSF) constructed wetlands in order to characterise heat transfer, mass dispersion and biological performance mechanisms. These studies have followed the beds from post construction through unplanted hydraulic base line studies to the current status of mature stands of Phragmites australis. Experimental observations indicate that in unplanted beds, daily thermal fluctuations are depth dependent and range from 1 to 9 degrees Celsius. These fluctuations result in daily thermal inversions, and enhanced mixing and oxygen transport. For planted beds, thermal fluctuations are depth independent, and have a constant amplitude of 2 degrees Celsius. Planted beds may be thermally stratified. Lithium tracer studies corroborate these results for the planted bed. In addition, performance studies indicate that organic pollutant removal is probably limited to organic suspended solids removal, with subsequent biological breakdown. <b>Current</b> first-order <b>plug</b> flow models can not account for these operational issues. A combined model is necessary to account for lateral dispersion, temperature gradients and settling of suspended solids to accurately reflect real biological removal mechanisms...|$|R
50|$|When starting, {{the glow}} plug is {{electrically}} preheated by electric <b>current.</b> The glow <b>plug</b> {{is not to}} be confused with a spark plug - there is no spark in the glow plug. Catalysis from methanol vapor on the heated platinum element keeps it red-hot even after voltage has been removed, which ignites the fuel and keeps the engine running. Whereas spark plugs are constantly used to ignite the fuel/air mix every time the piston comes up, as seen in the petrol engine where the spark plug is used, the fuel cannot be ignited with compression alone. It is the plug's temperature, still red-hot from previous ignition and from catalysis with the new compressed mixture, that ignites the fuel.|$|R
50|$|In time, the {{trembler}} coil {{system was}} seen as obsolete and was replaced, first by the ignition magneto and later by Kettering's battery ignition system, using battery, coil and contact breaker. These systems used a single ignition coil for the engine, supplying the spark to each cylinder in turn. A device called the distributor (previously used with magnetos) was used to switch the high-voltage <b>current</b> to each <b>plug</b> in turn. The high voltage distributor evolved from the timer and it too was a rotary switch driven at camshaft speed. The first high voltage distributors likewise used a wiping-contact, but as the current was at such a high voltage, these gave trouble with arcing and erosion of the contacts leading to a poor connection. It was realised that a jump-spark distributor would work equally well at high voltages and would be less susceptible to problems from erosion.|$|R
50|$|The oldest trams (1001-1005) {{controlled}} the motor current directly, through a slipring contact with five serial, four parallel and five braking steps. These {{controlled the}} power output directly, with a mechanism that breaking {{the power to}} the motors occurred in a contactor. The other trams had control current controllers, which was a 100 V power which controlled a contactor which again controlled the motors. Originally, the power was fed directly from the pantograph to the motors, via a resistance. From 1931, the trams were rebuilt with battery which fed the motors. Trams built from 1920 could be run in pairs with multiple-unit train control, via a cable with the control <b>current.</b> From 1943, <b>plugs</b> to connect the cables were not installed when trams were renovated. The maximum speed of the trams were 40 km/h when running at 600 V and 60 km/h when running at 1,200 V.|$|R
50|$|Another type of slide {{fence is}} similar {{except that the}} wires {{do not have to}} break and is easier to {{maintain}} and reset. The slide fence consists of a series of fence sections, as shown in the SLIDE FENCE DETAIL drawing (pictured right), which shows a typical installation. Each fence section is held in place by strong springs. At each end of a fence section is an electro-mechanical plug. The plugs maintain a complete electrical circuit that is monitored by signaling equipment. In normal operation, the <b>current</b> through the <b>plugs</b> causes a relay to energize, indicating that the fence is in place. When a rock slide occurs, the fence moves laterally, causing the plug to be removed, breaking the circuit. This causes the relay to become de-energized, indicating that a rock slide has occurred. A contact of the relay is typically used to prevent the approaching signal from displaying a proceed aspect if the fence has been broken. Restoring normal operation requires re-inserting the plugs that were dislodged by the slide.|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Hexactinellid sponges are metazoans {{in which}} the major tissue {{component}} is a multinucleated syncytium. The preferred deepwater habitat of these sponges makes collection of hexactinellids in good condition difficult, and has hindered extensive examination of their body plan. Nonetheless, {{over the last three}} decades {{a number of studies have}} explored their ecology, histology and physiology. It has been shown that hexactinellids are extremely long-lived animals. Their cytoplasm consists of a giant, multinucleated tissue, the trabecular syncytium, which is connected via open and plugged cytoplasmic bridges to cells such as archaeocytes, choanoblasts, and cells with spherical inclusions. Because all of the sponge is cytoplasmically interconnected, electrical signals can propagate through the animal. The effector response is arrest of the feeding <b>current.</b> The perforate <b>plugged</b> junction apparently allows tissues to specialize in different ways while maintaining limited cytoplasmic continuity. Larvae of hexactinellid sponges are already largely syn-cytial. Although it is not known when the first syncytial tissues are formed or when perforate plugged junctions first appear during embryogenesis, evidence that embryos are cellular until gastrulation suggests that hexactinellid sponges may have evolved from cellular sponges and that syncytial tissues are not a primitive trait of the Metazoa...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increase}} in demand for green energy, new technologies are evolved to improve energy efficiency. One of the methods to improve energy efficiency in electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles is regenerative braking. As regeneration is not effective during low speeds, hydraulic braking is being used along with regenerative braking. Different control algorithms are proposed in literature for proper selection between {{the two types of}} braking. The hydraulic braking system consists of multiple pistons that provide equal distribution of braking force on the wheels. However, this can be directly achieved by providing necessary braking torque on the shaft by applying dissipative braking at low speeds using an auxiliary motor parallel to the traction motor. In this thesis, a method is proposed where two induction motors are used, one as the traction motor and other as an auxiliary motor to demonstrate braking phenomenon. Plug braking of auxiliary motor is integrated with regenerative braking of main motor by coupling both the shafts of the two motors. The advantage of this method is that force is directly acting on the shaft and hence equal braking force is distributed on all the wheels, even at low speeds. The auxiliary motor can also be used for propulsion according to the torque demand and peak regeneration current can be counteracted by the <b>plugging</b> <b>current</b> thus limiting the battery current to its range. The disadvantage is that some amount energy is dissipated during plugging for small duration at low speeds. A transient analysis implementing vector control of induction machine is performed in Matlab and the results show good braking performance...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the tensile properties of irradiated fuel cladding {{in a hot}} cell, a simple test was developed at ORNL and is described fully in US Patent Application 20060070455, Expanded plug method for developing circumferential mechanical properties of tubular materials. This method is designed for testing fuel rod cladding ductility in a hot cell utilizing an expandable plug to stretch a small ring of irradiated cladding material. The specimen strain is determined using the measured diametrical expansion of the ring. This method removes many complexities associated with specimen preparation and testing. The advantages are the simplicity of measuring the test component assembly in the hot cell and the direct measurement of specimen strain. It was also found that cladding strength could be determined from the test results. The basic approach of this test method is to apply an axial compressive load to a cylindrical plug of polyurethane (or other materials) fitted inside a short ring of the test material to achieve radial expansion of the specimen. The diameter increase of the specimen {{is used to calculate}} the circumferential strain accrued during the test. The other two basic measurements are total applied load and amount of plug compression (extension). A simple procedure is used to convert the load circumferential strain data from the ring tests into material pseudo-stress-strain curves. However, several deficiencies exist in this expanded-plug loading ring test, which will impact accuracy of test results and introduce potential shear failure of the specimen due to inherited large axial compressive stress from the expansion plug test. First of all, the highly non-uniform stress and strain distribution resulted in the gage section of the clad. To ensure reliable testing and test repeatability, the potential for highly non-uniform stress distribution or displacement/strain deformation has to be eliminated at the gage section of the specimen. Second, significant compressive stresses were induced by clad bending deformation due to a clad bulging effect (or the barreling effect). The barreling effect caused very large localized shear stress in the clad and left testing material at a high risk of shear failure. The above combined effects will result in highly non-conservative predictions both in strength and ductility of the tested clad, and the associated mechanical properties as well. To overcome/mitigate the mentioned deficiencies associated with the <b>current</b> expansion <b>plug</b> test, systematic studies have been conducted. Through detailed parameter investigation on specific geometry designs, careful filtering of material for the expansion plug, as well as adding newly designed parts to the testing system, a method to reconcile the potential non-conservatism embedded in the expansion plug test system has been discovered. A modified expansion plug testing protocol has been developed based on the method. In order to closely resemble thin-wall theory, a general procedure was also developed to {{determine the}} hoop stress in the tested ring specimen. A scaling factor called -factor is defined to correlate the ring load P into hoop stress., =. The generated stress-strain curve agrees very well with tensile test data in both the elastic and plastic regions...|$|R
