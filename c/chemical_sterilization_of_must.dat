40|$|Swabs {{and water}} samples from a {{hospital}} water system were cultured for legionellae over an extended period. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, including outbreak associated strains, were isolated in small numbers from approximately 5 % of these samples despite implementation of the current DHSS/Welsh Office regulations. No cases of nosocomial legionnaires' disease were proven during the study. Physical cleaning and <b>chemical</b> <b>sterilization</b> <b>of</b> taps, and replacement of washers with 'approved' brands did not eradicate the organisms.

40|$|BackgroundA troubling {{number of}} health care-acquired {{infection}} outbreaks and transmission events, some involving highly resistant microbial pathogens and resulting in serious patient outcomes, have been traced to reusable, high-level disinfected duodenoscopes in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested a study {{be conducted to}} verify liquid <b>chemical</b> <b>sterilization</b> efficacy <b>of</b> SYSTEM 1 E® Liquid Chemical Sterilant Processing System (STERIS Corporation, Mentor, OH) with varied duodenoscope designs under especially arduous conditions. Here, we describe the system's performance under worst case SYSTEM 1 E® processing conditions. MethodsThe test protocol challenged the system's performance by running a fractional cycle to evaluate reduction of recoverable test spores from heavily contaminated endoscopes, including all channels and each distal tip, under worst case SYSTEM 1 E® processing conditions. ResultsAll devices were successfully liquid chemically sterilized, showing greater than a 6 log 10 reduction of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores at every inoculation site of each duodenoscope tested, in {{less than half the}} exposure time of the standard cycle. ConclusionsThe successful outcome of the additional efficacy testing reported here indicates that the SYSTEM 1 E® is an effective low-temperature liquid <b>chemical</b> <b>sterilization</b> method for duodenoscopes and other critical and semicritical devices. It offers a fast, safe, convenient processing alternative while providing the assurance of a system expressly tested and cleared to achieve liquid <b>chemical</b> <b>sterilization</b> <b>of</b> specific validated duodenoscope models...|$|R

40|$|Lately it {{has been}} {{observed}} a great interest in the research area of plant tissue culture in discovering new alternatives leading to cost reduction of the plants produced in commercial laboratories, in order to turn this alternative of plant propagation more economical. A potentially promising alternative for this reduction of costs, but which has not been receiving the due attention, is the possibility of substituting the autoclaving technique to a more economical one. With this purpose, two tests were carried out, using a new protocol of medium preparation, which consisted <b>of</b> the <b>chemical</b> <b>sterilization</b> <b>of</b> all the utensils used in the preparation and packaging of the culture medium as well, associated to the addition of the sterilizing agent to the medium, in different concentrations. The objective of the first test was to observe the influence of different concentrations of NaClO added to the culture medium, on its sterilization. The second test aimed at verifying the reaction of the Eucalyptus pellita tissues to different concentrations of NaClO in the culture medium. The addition of NaClO to the culture medium, equal or higher than 0. 0005 % in the fist test and of 0. 005 % in the second one, allowed complete <b>sterilization</b> <b>of</b> the medium, without observing any damage to the Eucalyptus pellita tissues, even when they were grown on culture medium containing up to 0. 009 %, the maximum concentration tried.

40|$|One of the {{alternatives}} to autoclaving culture media is <b>chemical</b> <b>sterilization,</b> which may cause fewer changes to the chemical composition of the media. In this study, the effect <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>sterilization</b> by inclusion <b>of</b> chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) in the culture medium on the in vitro development of gerbera (Gerbera jamesonii) cv.

Autoclaved medium was used as the control. ClO 2 in the culture medium reduced contamination at rates comparable to autoclaving when tested at three stages of the culture process: in vitro establishment, multiplication, and rooting. Plantlets grown in culture media sterilized with ClO 2 showed similar or better development than those grown in autoclaved culture medium. Use of 0. 0025 % ClO 2 to sterilize the culture medium resulted in better plantlet development than autoclaved medium, regardless of the stage of micropropagation. Vliet Flora Co.

Thermal sterilization is traditionally used; however, costs deriving from equipment acquisition and maintenance render this technique costly. With the purpose of finding an alternative to thermal sterilization, this research aimed at assessing the efficiency and ideal concentration of sodium hypochlorite for <b>sterilization</b> <b>of</b> culture media and glassware used during rooting of micropropagated Gerbera hybrida cv. Essandre. Two experiments were carried out. In the first one, treatments consisted of control I (no sterilization), control II (thermal sterilization), and total active chlorine concentrations of 0. 0005, 0. 001, 0. 002 and 0. 003 %. In the second experiment, based on the results observed in the first experiment, treatments consisted of control I (thermal <b>sterilization)</b> and II (<b>chemical</b> <b>sterilization),</b> and total active chlorine concentrations of 0. 002, 0. 0025 and 0. 003 %. Plant behavior was assessed based on the length of aerial part and roots, number of roots, and dry biomass of plants. Results showed that the addition of an active chlorine concentration of 0. 003 % to culture media provided total control of contaminants, and {{there were no significant differences}} regarding the variables analyzed between plants obtained with thermal sterilization and with sodium hypochlorite <b>sterilization.</b> Thus, <b>chemical</b> <b>sterilization</b> can be used as a replacement for thermal <b>sterilization</b> <b>of</b> nutrition media for rooting of gerbera in vitro. 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{autoclaving}} {{used for}} <b>sterilization</b> <b>of</b> glassware, culture media and surgical materials in laboratory is a costly operation, {{due to the}} high cost of the equipment and the equally high consumption of energy.

40|$|Without doubt, {{there is}} a need and a demand for a <b>chemical</b> method <b>of</b> tubal <b>sterilization.</b> <b>Chemicals</b> <b>of</b> various categories, {{including}} caustic, sclerosing, granuloma-producing, and cytotoxic agents and tissue adhesives have been tested in both animal models and humans. 2 The most effective agent appears to be quinacrine, and, depending on the mode of delivery, it can cause bilateral tubal closure rates in excess of 90 %. Clinically, quinacrine has been used in several developing countries. Efforts have been directed toward improving the efficacy of quinacrine by manipulating the mode of delivery. One approach has been a change from its administration as a slurry to a compacted pellet. V- or T-shaped IUD vectors, with quinacrine located at the tips, have been especially designed to ensure delivery of the drug to the cornual region of the uterus near the uterotubal junction.

The drugs tested include quinacrinelike compounds, namely chloroquine, primaquine and trimethoprim; and tetracycline and its analogues which are known sclerosing agents. The quinacrine-like drugs were relatively ineffective in producing uterine lesions similar to those of quinacrine, but like quinacrine, chloroquine and primaquine showed some toxicity. Tetracycline and its analogues produced quinacrine-like morphologic changes in the rat uterus and showed no toxicity for the doses tested.
