5|$|As the {{pressure}} was released by the cabin rupture, the convective rush of air caused the flames to spread across the cabin, beginning the second phase. The third phase began {{when most of the}} oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air, essentially quenching the fire, but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill the <b>cabin,</b> <b>and</b> large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s and in {{the early}} 1960s, VAT and the French Camions Willème SA had plans for joint production, but only one jointly {{produced}} prototype was ever made; the chassis was from Vanaja, the engine was from AEC, and the cabin, which was a forward control type <b>cabin</b> <b>and</b> partly made from glass fibre, was from Willème.|$|E

5|$|Departure from Beirut {{was delayed}} by about one hour. Originally {{scheduled}} to depart at 05:45, take-off took place only at 06:01. Less than 15 minutes later, two Arab passengers threatened {{to blow up}} the aircraft using explosives that had been hidden in the first class <b>cabin</b> (<b>and</b> which likely had been smuggled there in Damascus) if the members of Black September were not released from the German prison.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the food}} shortage, more {{buildings}} were constructed. The Northern Commercial Company built a store to replace Barnette's <b>cabin,</b> <b>and</b> Wickersham recorded {{a wide range}} of businesses, including 500 houses and 1,200 people. To manage the growing population, the settlement held a vote on November 10, 1903 to decide whether to incorporate Fairbanks as a town or not. The vote passed, and Barnette was sworn in as the city's first mayor on the next day.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Boeing {{introduced}} overhead crew rests as {{an option}} on the 777. Located above the main <b>cabin</b> <b>and</b> connected via staircases, the forward flight crew rest contains two seats and two bunks, while the aft cabin crew rest features multiple bunks. The Signature Interior has since been adapted for other Boeing wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, including 737NG, 747-400, 757-300, and newer 767 models, including all 767-400ER models. The 747-8 and 767-400ER have also adopted the larger, more rounded windows of the original 777.|$|E

5|$|The de Havilland DH 106 Comet was the world's first {{commercial}} jetliner. Developed and manufactured by de Havilland at its Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom headquarters, the Comet1 prototype first flew on 27 July 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four de Havilland Ghost turbojet engines {{buried in the}} wings, a pressurised fuselage, and large square windows. For the era, it offered a relatively quiet, comfortable passenger <b>cabin</b> <b>and</b> showed signs of being a commercial success at its 1952 debut.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, T'Pol {{returns to}} her <b>cabin</b> <b>and</b> is {{surprised}} to find Rajiin inside. She tries to resist, but is soon overcome. Rajiin attempts to flee using the transporter, but is quickly captured {{and placed in the}} brig. As Archer attempts to question her, Lieutenant Reed informs him that two Reptilian ships are on an intercept course. Rajiin admits she was gathering information for the Xindi. Reptilians, after running battles with the crew, retrieve Rajiin and take her back to one of the ships. Enterprise attempts to pursue, but the Xindi enters a subspace vortex. Afterwards, the Council convenes again to discuss the development and construction of a new bio-weapon, a project helped by Archer's bio-data that was stolen by Rajiin.|$|E

Nine barrels {{have been found}} to contain bones of cattle, indicating that they contained pieces of beef butchered and stored as ship's rations.

5|$|Dolarhyde, Ella, {{and other}} townsfolk form a posse to track an injured alien that {{escaped from the}} downed ship. Meanwhile, Jake travels to an {{abandoned}} <b>cabin</b> <b>and,</b> in a flashback, recalls returning to it with stolen gold and then being abducted, along with a woman named Alice, by the aliens. His memories returning, Jake joins up with the posse. During the evening, the group comes upon a capsized paddle wheel steamboat that the aliens apparently dumped {{hundreds of miles from}} any rivers capable of holding it. They camp in it, and during the night the alien they were tracking kills Meacham, who sacrifices himself to save Emmett, Taggart's grandson.|$|E
5|$|During {{tests with}} the Ju 87 A-2, new {{technologies}} were tried out {{to reduce the}} effects of g forces. The pressurised cabin was of great importance during this research. Testing revealed that at high altitude, even 2 g could cause death in an unpressurised <b>cabin</b> <b>and</b> without appropriate clothing. This new technology, along with special clothing and oxygen masks, was researched and tested. When the United States Army occupied the Junkers factory at Dessau on 21 April 1945, they were both impressed at and interested in the medical flight tests with the Ju 87.|$|E
