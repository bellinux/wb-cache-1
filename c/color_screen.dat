5|$|The {{developer}} and {{producer of the}} original Metroid for the Nintendo Entertainment System – Nintendo Research & Development 1 (Nintendo R) and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Metroid II. The developers of the game added round metal shoulders on Samus' Varia Suit to differentiate it from her Power Suit, since both looked similar on the Game Boy's limited greyscale display. The updated suit has since been {{a staple of the}} series, appearing in all subsequent games. A unique color palette for Metroid II was added to the Game Boy Color console, a successor to the original Game Boy with a <b>color</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E

25|$|Autochrome, {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} color process, {{was introduced by}} the Lumière brothers in 1907. Autochrome plates incorporated a mosaic color filter layer made of dyed grains of potato starch, which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments. After an Autochrome plate was reversal processed to produce a positive transparency, the starch grains served to illuminate each fragment with the correct color and the tiny colored points blended together in the eye, synthesizing {{the color of the}} subject by the additive method. Autochrome plates were one of several varieties of additive <b>color</b> <b>screen</b> plates and films marketed between the 1890s and the 1950s.|$|E

[...] By contrast, IGN reviewer Levi Buchanan noted the Game Gear's biggest fault was its game library when compared to the Game Boy, stating that [...] "the software was completely lacking compared to its chief rival, which was bathed in quality games. It didn't matter that the Game Gear was more powerful. The <b>color</b> <b>screen</b> did not reverse any fortunes.

[...] Buchanan later went on to praise some parts of the Game Gear's library, however, stating [...] "Some of those Master System tweaks were very good games, and fun is resilient against time." [...] Retro Gamer praised Sega's accomplishment in surviving against the competition of Nintendo in the handheld console market with the Game Gear, noting that [...] "for all the handhelds that have gone up against the might of Nintendo and ultimately lost out, Sega's Game Gear managed to last the longest, only outdone in sales by the Sony PSP.

500|$|The Game Boy's {{black-and-white}} graphics {{resulted in}} changes to Samus's gear that eventually became permanent. In the original Metroid, color {{was used to}} differentiate between Samus's Power Suit and her Varia Suitan upgraded version. However, without color on the Game Boy, the two suits would have appeared similar, requiring the developers to develop a visual indicator for players to determine which suit Samus is wearing. They also updated her Varia Suit, adding round metal shoulders that {{have been a part}} of the suit in every game in the series since then.

500|$|Similar to the Genesis and the Mega Jet, the Nomad's main CPU is a Motorola 68000. Possessing similar memory, graphics, {{and sound}} capabilities, the Nomad is nearly {{identical}} to the full-size console; the only variation {{is that it is}} completely self-sufficient. The Nomad has a 3.25 inch backlit <b>color</b> <b>screen</b> and an A/V output that allows the Nomad to be played on a television screen. Design elements of the handheld were made similar to the Game Gear, but included six buttons for full compatibility with later Genesis releases. Also included were a red power switch, headphone jack, volume dial, and separate controller input for multiplayer games. The controller port functions as player 2, so single-player games cannot be played with a Genesis controller. The Nomad could be powered by an AC adapter, a battery recharger known as the Genesis Nomad PowerBack, or six AA batteries, which provide a battery life of two to three hours. The Nomad consumed more power (DC 9V, 3.5W) than Sega's earlier portable gaming console, the Game Gear (DC 9V, 3W). The Nomad also lacks a [...] "Reset" [...] button, which makes it impossible to complete certain games, such as the X-Men video game, which require pressing the button to finish certain objectives.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} model to explain the bottomonium {{suppression}} in Pb+Pb collisions at mid rapidity obtained from Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energy, √(s_NN) = 2. 76 TeV. The model consists of two decoupled mechanisms namely, <b>color</b> <b>screening</b> during bottomonium production followed by gluon induced dissociation along with collisional damping. The quasi-particle model (QPM) is used as equation of state (EOS) for the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) medium. The feed-down from higher Υ states, such as Υ(1 P), Υ(2 S) and Υ(2 P), dilated formation times for bottomonium states and viscous effect of QGP medium are other ingredients included in the current formulation. We further assume that the QGP is expanding according to (1 + 1) -dimensional Bjorken's boost invariant scaling law. The net suppression (in terms of p_T integrated survival probability) for bottomonium states at mid rapidity is obtained {{as a function of}} centrality and the result is then compared both quantitatively and qualitatively with the recent LHC experimental data in the mid rapidity region recently published by CMS collaboration. We find that the current model, based on the Debye <b>color</b> <b>screening</b> plus gluonic dissociation along with collisional damping, better describes the centrality dependence of bottomonium suppression at LHC energy as compared to <b>color</b> <b>screening</b> model alone. 0. 5 cm Keywords : <b>Color</b> <b>screening,</b> Gluonic dissociation, Collisional damping, Survival probability PACS numbers : 12. 38.
