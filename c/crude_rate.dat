In the frame of this development are process of mortality, fertility, nuptality, divorce rate, induced abortion rate and {{rate of natural increase}} and net migration at the level of district and administrative municipalities with extended powers (ORP) using the following indicators: life expectancy at birth, infant mortality rate, total fertility rate, the general marriage rate, the general rate of divorce, abortion-livebirth ratio, <b>crude</b> <b>rate</b> of natural change and the <b>crude</b> <b>rate</b> of net migration. The next section deals with a cluster analysis, which aims to show the typology of the Pardubice region by district based on the above variables.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{analysis}} {{of morbidity and mortality}} data, variance component models are commonly used to provide an improvement in the estimation of rates for small regions which typically show large variability. This article investigates Irish suicide data using Poisson mixed models. The random effect distributions are estimated using Nonparametric Maximum likelihood which allows the cal-culation of shrinkage estimates from the posterior probability estimates of the EM algorithm, as well as the construction of ‘league tables’. As these models are inefficient in the case of spatial dependency, we investigate the addition of spatial autocorrelation terms based on neighboring average crude rates and standardized mortality ratios, as well as gender-specific versions of these. We consider models for the average <b>crude</b> <b>rate</b> {{as well as for the}} relative risk. A close correspondence between fitted values from both types of models suggests that information con-cerning within-region variability, incorporated in the parameters of the average <b>crude</b> <b>rate</b> model, appears indirectly in the simpler relative risk model by means of the expected values used in the offset term of the latter...|$|E

40|$|<b>Crude</b> <b>rates</b> {{such as the}} <b>crude</b> death <b>rate</b> are {{functions}} of both the age-specific rates and the age composition of a population. However, differences in the age structure between two populations or two time periods can result in specious differences in the corresponding <b>crude</b> <b>rates</b> making direct comparisons between populations or across time inappropriate. Therefore, when comparing <b>crude</b> <b>rates</b> between populations, it is desirable to eliminate or minimize the influence of age composition. This task is accomplished by using a standard age structure yielding an age-standardized rate. This paper proposes an updated International Network for the Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health (INDEPTH) standard for use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) based on newly available data from the health and demographic surveillance system site members of the INDEPTH network located throughout Africa and southern Asia. The updated INDEPTH standard should better reflect the age structure of LMICs and result in more accurate health indicators and demographic rates. We demonstrate use of the new INDEPTH standard along with several existing ‘world’ standards and show how resulting age-standardized <b>crude</b> deaths <b>rates</b> differ when using the various standard age compositions...|$|R

40|$|International labour {{migration}} is mainly promoted by economic interests. This paper {{focuses on the}} period {{before and after the}} economic crisis and puts together important facts regarding motivation to {{labour migration}} and provides explanations of its causes and impacts on the macroeconomic level. The economic explanation why is migration so severely restricted is that migration policies are essentially distributive tools, aiming at reducing negative effects of migration on wages and unemployment among natives and moreover, we may stress out the gradualist tendencies of migration and such migration restrictions can mitigate supply-side shocks that may negatively affect incomes or jobs of some specific groups. A partial objective of the practical part of the paper is to evaluate relationships between the rate of migration and selected economic indicators using adequate quantitative methods. While the correlation between the <b>crude</b> <b>rate</b> of net migration and the GDP per capita is very low, the existence of correlation between the <b>crude</b> <b>rate</b> of net migration and the unemployment rate is evident in the most of analysed countries. Statistical insignificance of correlation indices in some countries can be then attributed to structural problems of those economies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis is a {{preliminary}} {{investigation into the}} role of macro-level demographic factors, namely <b>crude</b> birth <b>rate,</b> <b>crude</b> death <b>rate,</b> total fertility rate and life expectancy at birth, in the new purchase of three different types of life insurance, i. e. whole life, endowment and temporary insurance, using correlational and linear regression analysis. From correlational analysis, both the current and lagged <b>crude</b> birth <b>rates,</b> <b>crude</b> death <b>rates</b> and total fertility rates are found to have significant weak to moderately strong positive relationship, while both the current and lagged variables of life expectancy at birth have significant moderately strong negative relationship with the growth of the new purchase of both whole life and temporary insurance. On the other hand, while none of the current-period demographic factors are found to have any significant relationship but the lags of <b>crude</b> birth <b>rate</b> and <b>crude</b> death <b>rate</b> are found to have significant weak positive relationship with the growth of the new purchase of endowment insurance. From linear regression analysis, only <b>crude</b> birth <b>rate</b> is found to have a significant positive relationship with the growth of the new purchase of whole life insurance. The findings show that demographic factors seem to play a minor role in the purchasing of new life insurance, and <b>crude</b> birth <b>rate</b> appears to be the demographic factor that is important in explaining the new purchase of whole life insurance. As this is {{a preliminary}} investigation, further research in this respect is warranted...|$|R

Methods: Emergency Department reports at every Hospitals and clinical data of all Mental Health Units were revised in Tenerife (1992 - 1996) and in Gran Canaria (1994 - 1996). Data about age, sex, address, educational level, marital status, job situation, time and methods used for committing parasuicide and previous parasuicide events were collected. Results: In Tenerife Island the annual average was 355 parasuicides among which 24. 9 % of the episodes were repeaters. The average <b>crude</b> <b>rate</b> was 70. 99 cases per 100. 000 inhabitants and the standardized rate was 61. 81. In Gran Canaria Island the annual average was 634 and 21. 3 % were repeaters.

The following are the rate algorithms. <b>Crude</b> <b>Rate</b> A <b>crude</b> <b>rate</b> {{is the number of}} new cases (or deaths) occurring in a specified population per year, usually expressed as the number of cases per 100, 000 population at risk. SEER*Stat allows you to display rates as cases per 1, 000; 10, 000; 100, 000; or 1 million. Age-adjusted Rate An age-adjusted rate is a weighted average of crude rates, where the crude rates are calculated for different age groups and the weights are the proportions of persons in the corresponding age groups of a standard population. Several sets of standard populations are included in SEER*Stat. These include the total U. S. populations (1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000), 1991 and 1996 Canadian populations, European population, and the world population.

We aim to evaluate the potential impact of the smoke ban on the number of ACS events in the Portuguese population. In addition, we evaluate the longitudinal effects of the smoking ban several years after its implementation. Methods. We analyzed the admission rate for ACS before and after the ban using data from hospital admission. Monthly <b>crude</b> <b>rate</b> was computed, using the Portuguese population as the denominator. Data concerning the proportion of smokers among ACS patients were obtained from the NRACS. Interrupted time series were used to assess changes over time. Results. A decline of − 5. 8 % was found for ACS <b>crude</b> <b>rate</b> after the smoking ban. The decreasing trend was observed even after years since the law. The effect of the ban was higher in men and for people over 65 years. The most significant reduction of ACS rate was found in Lisbon. Conclusions. Our results suggest that smoking ban is related to a decline in ACS admissions, supporting the importance of smoke legislation as a public health measure, contributing to the reduction of ACS rate...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to evaluate relationships of the rate of migration and the unemployment rate in established member countries of the European Union covering also {{the period of the}} last financial and economic crisis and using statistical methods. To determine parameters of a regression function were used methods of regression and correlation analysis including testing the statistical significance. Nearly all countries (except Luxemburg and Austria) show a negative linear relationship between tested indicators however not always statistically significant. Based on these results, the existence of correlation is evident between the <b>crude</b> <b>rate</b> of net migration and the unemployment rate in more than a half of the monitored countries. Calculated correlation indices show highly statistically significant results for typically immigrant’s destination countries, e. g. Germany, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, and Belgium but we can find statistically significant results also in countries which are facing enormous economic problems during the last financial and economic crisis, esp. in Ireland, Spain and Italy. With an exemption of Belgium, the selected type of regression function doesn’t play a role as it regards the statistical significance of correlation indices and the use of polynomials of higher degrees doesn’t improve those results significantly. The analysis of the <b>crude</b> <b>rate</b> of net migration and the unemployment rate presented in this paper can be further used and developed when other variables would be added to the model...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: The {{incidence}} of colorectal cancer (CC) is increasing in many Asian countries, but decreasing in western countries. The present {{study examined the}} local {{incidence of}} CC {{in the past few}} decades. Methods: A population based study, using data from Hong Kong (HK) Cancer Registry, was carried out to examine the trends of CC in different age groups in HK. Comparison with other countries was made. Results: The <b>crude</b> <b>rate</b> of CC in HK increased from 29. 6 / 100 000 in 1983 to 57. 1 / 100 000 in 2006. Age standardized rate (ASR) increased by less than 20 %. It was markedly smaller than the 190 % increase in <b>crude</b> <b>rate.</b> ASR progressively increased in males. In females, ASR peaked in 1994 and declined in the last decade. In most countries, the risk of CC was higher and increasing in males, but stable or decreasing in females. With respect to age, increasing risk was noted in males above 60 years old and females above 70 years old. However, a declining rate was noted in those below 50 years old. The decrease was over 40 % in the 30 - 34 years group over the past two decades.
