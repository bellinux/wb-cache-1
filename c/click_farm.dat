5000|$|A <b>click</b> <b>farm</b> {{is a form}} of click fraud, where a {{large group}} of low-paid workers are hired to click on paid {{advertising}} links for the click fraudster (<b>click</b> <b>farm</b> master or click farmer). The workers click the links, surf the target website for a period of time, and possibly sign up for newsletters prior to clicking another link. For many of these workers, clicking on enough ads per day may increase their revenue substantially and may also be an alternative to other types of work. It is extremely difficult for an automated filter to detect this simulated traffic as fake because the visitor behavior appears exactly {{the same as that of}} an actual legitimate visitor.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two methods}} to click farming. The first is by hiring {{competitor}} fraudsters to deplete the advertising {{budget of the}} competitor {{so that they will}} be able to have their ads shown in higher pay-per-click rankings at a lower cost. In this case, the competitor is weakened instead of being outbid in the pay-per-click bidding system. The investment on the <b>click</b> <b>farm</b> made by the fraudster is only a very small fraction of the amount lost by the competitor. The second is by hiring the <b>click</b> <b>farm</b> workers to click on ads on the click farmer's own site. This way, the money lost by the advertisers is gained by the click farmer, rather than by the search engines and content networks as in the first method.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>click</b> <b>farm</b> {{services}} violate {{many social}} media user policies, {{there are no}} government regulations that render them illegal. However, Sam DeSilva, a lawyer specializing in IT and outsourcing law at Manches LLP in Oxford had mentioned that: [...] "Potentially, a number of laws are being breached - the consumer protection and unfair trading regulations. Effectively it's misleading the individual consumers." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Click</b> <b>farms</b> {{are usually}} located in {{developing}} countries, such as India, the Philippines, and Bangladesh. <b>Click</b> <b>farms</b> extends to likes and followers {{on social media}} platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and more. Workers are paid on an average, one US dollar for a thousand likes or follow a thousand people on Twitter. On the other hand, <b>click</b> <b>farms</b> sell their likes and followers {{at a much higher}} price. According to the Daily Mail, [...] "BuyPlusFollowers sells 250 Google+ shares for $12.95. InstagramEngine sells 1,000 &#91;Instagram&#93; followers for $12. AuthenticHits sells 1,000 SoundCloud plays for $9." ...|$|R
5000|$|Engagement rate, a {{performance}} metric that measures {{the quality of}} social media activity such as Facebook likes or Twitter retweets, can be interpreted in terms of [...] "engagement per follower," [...] measured by dividing the raw counts of social media activity {{by the number of}} followers. Users who engage in short term <b>click</b> <b>farms</b> services will see their engagement rate plummet in time as the initial increase in the volume of social media activity drops when the <b>click</b> <b>farms</b> services end, coupled with the increase in fake followers if not the same.|$|R
50|$|Fake likes {{generating}} from <b>click</b> <b>farms</b> {{are essentially}} {{different from those}} arising from computer bots where computer programs are written by software experts. To deal with such issues, companies such as Facebook are trying to create algorithms that seek to wipe out accounts with unusual activities (e.g. liking too many pages at one go).|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of Dave Jones' video about Batteriser, his video was disliked by a torrent of IP {{addresses}} located in Vietnam. Other bloggers with Batteroo Boost-related videos experienced similar activity from addresses in Vietnam. The bloggers involved suspect that either a <b>click</b> <b>farm</b> in Vietnam was engaged to disrepute those attacking Batteroo Boost, or a single computer with many fake or stolen YouTube accounts utilized proxied IP addresses to cover its tracks. Due to the anonymous nature of the attacks, it is currently unknown who was responsible.|$|E
50|$|After release, {{hundreds}} of thousands of people download the Pied Piper platform, leading to thoughts of a Series B funding round, and a sense of triumph when the Hooli board decides to allow it to be sold in the online Hooli Store. However, only a small fraction of the people installing the platform remain as daily active users. Focus groups investigating why this is the case reveal that Monica's instincts were correct - although it is an engineering triumph, most people do not understand how the platform works and find its design confusing and counter-intuitive. Richard decides that the best way to address this is through an outreach program to try and better explain the system, but this effort fails. Despondent, Richard expects the company to close down, but regains confidence at a sudden uptick in usership - which was due to Jared secretly employing a <b>click</b> <b>farm</b> in Bangladesh to artificially inflate usage statistics.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDigital labor designates platform-based algorithm-mediated tasks {{performed}} by human users of websites and apps. It concerns on-demand {{services such as}} Uber, micro-work portals such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, as well as data extraction via connected devices or social media such as Facebook. Digital labor studies have so far mainly focused on US and Europe. A new breed of research projects aims to correct this bias by intersecting labor, media, post-colonial, and subaltern studies, and tackle developing and emerging countries where the rise of digital labor accompanies low rates of formal employment. Newly available evidence offers insights into dynamics of social exclusion and exploitation through the outsourcing of online tasks to non-Western countries. The {{last part of the}} article discusses the extent to which this vast <b>click</b> <b>farm</b> economy predicated on value and data transfer from the Global South to the North can be construed as a " neocolonial " system...|$|E
5000|$|The {{need for}} <b>click</b> <b>farming</b> arises because, as The Guardian states, [...] "31% will check ratings and reviews, {{including}} likes and Twitter followers, before {{they choose to}} buy something." [...] This shows the increasing importance that businesses, celebrities and other organisations put {{on the number of}} likes and followers they have. This creates monetary values for likes and followers which means that businesses and celebrities feel compelled to increase their likes to create a positive online profile.|$|R
50|$|Pay-per-click providers, {{including}} Google, Yahoo!, and MSN, {{have made}} substantial efforts to combat click fraud. Automated filters remove most click fraud attempts at the source. According to Deanna Yick, {{a spokeswoman for}} Mountain View, California-based Google, she said that “We design our systems to catch bot-related attacks.” “Because {{a significant amount of}} malicious traffic is automated, advertisers are protected from these kinds of attacks.” she added. In an effort to circumvent these filtering systems, click fraudsters have begun to use these <b>click</b> <b>farms</b> to mimic actual visitors.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{companies}} {{have tried to}} mitigate the effects of <b>click</b> <b>farming.</b> Coca-Cola made its 2010 Super Bowl advert [...] "Hard Times" [...] private after learning it was shared on Shareyt and issued a statement that it [...] "did not approve of fake fans." [...] Hasbro was alerted to an online casino, a sub-licensee of its Monopoly brand had added fake Facebook likes and hence contacted Facebook to remove the site. Hasbro issued a statement that it was “appalled to hear of what had occurred” and claimed no previous knowledge of the page.|$|R

500|$|In {{addition}} to content generating bots, users can purchase followers, favorites, retweets and comments on various websites {{that cater to}} expanding a user's image through accumulation of followers. With more followers, users' profiles gain more attention, thus increasing their popularity. Generating Web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability. With Twitterbots, users are able {{to create the illusion}} of [...] "buzz" [...] on their site by obtaining followers from services such as Swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot <b>farms</b> or <b>click</b> <b>farms.</b> The companies that facilitate this service create fake Twitter accounts that follow a number of people, some of these Twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like they are real. This practice of obtaining mass amounts of twitterbots as followers is not permitted on Twitter. The emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities, politicians, musicians, public figures, and companies alike. According to The New York Times, bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections, influence the stock market, public appeal, and attack governments.|$|R
40|$|Botnets are {{collections}} of computers which {{have come under}} the control of a malicious person or organization, and can be ordered to perform various mali-cious tasks such as sending spam mail,performing <b>click</b> fraud, <b>farming</b> personal or other confidential information, or performing distributed denial of service at-tacks. They are currently {{regarded as one of the}} major threats to the widespread use of the Internet, and finding ways to counter them is a challenge of great im-portance. The goal of the thesis is to produce a simple prototype which detects botnet attacks by correlating patterns of anomalous behavior which develop in similar ways in different parts of a network, such as within a sub-set of the computers within a given subnet. In order to accomplish this we carried out a study of the literature on analysis methods of this type and decided to exploit a method which combines both host-level and network-level information to detect anoma-lous behavior. We selected a suitable platform and operating system to perform the analysis. We were able to obtain some valuable results from the analysis, but it was not enough to come up with a precise conclusion. i...|$|R
500|$|Revolution Software's {{point and}} click {{adventure}} game [...] was first released in 1996. While investigating a murder, protagonist and player character George Stobbart finds himself uncovering a dark mystery regarding the Knights Templar. A medieval manuscript which he obtained {{during the investigation}} leads him to a castle located in Lochmarne, Ireland. As he cannot enter the castle through the main entrance door, he climbs a haystack, which stops short {{of the top of}} the wall. He puts a sewer key which he obtained {{at the beginning of the}} game in a crack in the wall, which forms a step, allowing him to climb over the wall. Inside the castle, an entrance to an underground dig is located. A tied-up goat is sitting near the entrance; however, the rope to which it is tied is long enough to allow it to prevent George from reaching the entrance by butting him. An old piece of farming machinery is located at the left side of the screen, but George is unable to interact with it, as the goat continues to butt him. George must allow the goat to butt him when trying to reach the entrance, but while the goat is returning to its original position, the player must <b>click</b> on the <b>farming</b> machinery, which causes George to quickly jump up and run to the machinery and slightly reposition it. When returned to its original position, the goat again charges and butts George, but while doing so, gets its rope entangled with the machinery, due to its repositioning. This allows George to move freely and enter the dig.|$|R
