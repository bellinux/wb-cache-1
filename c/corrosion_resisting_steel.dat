40|$|M. Ing. Type 3 CR 12 {{steel is}} a <b>corrosion</b> <b>resisting</b> <b>steel</b> which is {{intended}} to be an alternative structural steel to replace the use of coated mild steel and low alloy steels in mild corrosive environments. This necessitate the experimental verification of the structural behaviour thereof. The purpose of this dissertation is therefore to compare the experimental structural bending behaviour regarding elastic and inelastic lateral torsional buckling of doubly symmetric I-beams and monosymmetric channel sections with the existing theories for carbon steel beams and to modify or develop new applicable theories if necessary. From the theoretical and experimental results it is concluded that the behaviour of heat treated Type 3 CR 12 beams can be estimated fairly accurate with existing theories and that the tangent modulus approach should be used for more accurate estimates as well as for beams that are not heat treated...|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} work {{was carried out}} to investigate the effectiveness of high-strength self-compacting concrete (SF-R) in controlling corrosion of embedded steel. Reinforced concrete cylinders and plain cubes were subjected to 5 % NaCl solution. Slump flow, J-ring, V-funnel, compressive strength, electrical resistance, and electrochemical tests were conducted. <b>Corrosion</b> <b>resisting</b> characteristics of <b>steel</b> were examined by monitoring corrosion potential, polarization resistance, corrosion currents, and Tafel plots. The relationship between corrosion current density and corrosion potential was established. Results were compared with characteristics of a grade 40 [*]MPa reference concrete (R) and grade 70 [*]MPa conventional self-compacting concrete (SP). Results indicated that at 270 days of exposure, the corrosion currents for steel in SF-R were 63 - and 16 -fold lower compared to those of steel in R and SP concretes, respectively. This concrete showed a considerable increase in electrical resistance and compressive strength of 96 [*]MPa at 28 days of exposure. Relying on corrosion risk classification based on corrosion current densities and corrosion potentials, the steel in SF-R concrete is definitely in the passive condition. The splendid durability performance of steel in SF-R concrete linked to adorable self-compacting features could furnish numerous opportunities for future structural applications in severe environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Cadmium {{electroplating}} {{is widely}} used in the aerospace industry for the corrosion protection of aircraft components like fasteners manufactured from non <b>corrosion</b> <b>resisting</b> high strength <b>steels.</b> However, environmental and safety concerns over the high toxicity of cadmium and its compounds {{have led to the}} investigation of suitable replacements. Alternatives to cadmium should offer effective corrosion protection and have no detrimental effects on the steel substrate. Hydrogen is known to be absorbed during processes like electroplating, thus causing hydrogen embrittlement on high strength steel fasteners. Another source of hydrogen is the water reduction occuring in parallel with the corrosion of the coating, and thus causing re–embrittlement of the steel substrate. This study has investigated the effect of the application of two aluminium–based coatings, SermeTel CR 984 –LT and Galvano–Aluminium Alcotec, on the hydrogen re–embrittlement of high strength steels used for aerospace applications. Slow strain rate testing has been performed to study the effect of hydrogen on the re–embrittlement of the steel substrate {{as a result of the}} corrosion of the aluminium–based coatings in a variety of environments, such as NaCl solution, salt spray and marine atmosphere. Permeation measurements have been used to measure hydrogen uptake by unplated steel membranes potentiostatically charged at the potentials of the aluminium–based coatings, so as to simulate the amount of absorbed hydrogen due to their corrosion. Corrosion tests have been utilised to evaluate the performance of SermeTel CR 984 –LT and Galvano–Aluminium Alcotec. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the <b>corrosion</b> <b>resisting</b> {{property}} of ferrous metals in molten zinc, siliconizing, molybdenumizing and silicon-molybdenumizing are carried out on the Q 235 steel surface by solid powder method. The infiltration layers’ morphology, compactness degree, microhardness, component and phase structure are analyzed. Moreover, the samples are soaked in the molten zinc bath at 470 ℃ for 26 h, and their corrosion rate is measured. The {{results show that the}} intermetallic compounds (Fe 3 Si, Fe 3 Mo, MoSi 2 and Mo 5 Si 3) with good <b>corrosion</b> <b>resisting</b> property are produced in infiltration layers. The addition of Mo element can promote the penetration of Si element in the infiltration agents, thus increasing the compact density of infiltration layers. The comparative results also prove that the silicon-molybdenumizing layers are more compact, especially for the sample with m(Si) ∶m(Mo) = 2 ∶ 1. Its corrosion rate decreases almost two orders of magnitude compared with that of the substrate, showing better <b>corrosion</b> <b>resisting</b> property. However, the existence of defects (such as holes) in the infiltration layers leads to the decrease of compact density, and the <b>corrosion</b> <b>resisting</b> property in molten zinc is also affected. Therefore, in the future studies much attention should be paid to the improvement of the compact density of solid infiltration layers, so as to further increase the <b>corrosion</b> <b>resisting</b> property...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. During all {{manufacturing}} processes {{it is crucial}} to use certain design criteria and guidelines. Special care should be exercised when the final product of a manufacturing process is used in the automotive industry, because the failure of such a component may have tragic consequences. The failure of a bus chassis in the public transport sector {{is an example of a}} case where the failure of a product can have serious consequences. In recent years it has become common practice to use corrosion-resisting steel in the manufacture of these vehicles. The reason for this is the corrosion caused by a prolonged service life and adverse conditions such as salted road surfaces (The salt is used to melt the ice that forms on roads, particularly in European countries). These bus structures consist of tubes of varying size and geometry, and the manufacturing process of these tubes is considered in the present investigation. In a tube manufacturing process the design criteria may consist of such properties as the tube size and geometry, the thickness of the sheet that is used and the radius of the corners of the tube. Design criterion is also dependent upon the material that is used. The change in mechanical properties of the material during a manufacturing process is an important consideration during the establishment of design guidelines. The purpose of this investigation is to study the effects of particularly the cold forming manufacturing process on the mechanical properties of the material. The material used is 3 CR 12 <b>corrosion</b> <b>resisting</b> <b>steel,</b> a proprietary alloy also known as Type 1. 4003, that was developed by Columbus joint venture as a cheaper alternative to stainless steels. 3 CR 12 is not a substitute for stainless steel but it is an alternative to treated mild steel, providing a cost-effective solution to corrosion. An experimental investigation is conducted into the forming of 40 mm 3 CR 12 square tubes and normal plate bending of 3 CR 12. Various different wall thicknesses and bend radiuses are considered. A numerical investigation consisted of simulating the above-mentioned {{manufacturing processes}} using non-linear finite element analysis and then comparing its results to the experimental investigation. The experimental investigation showed that substantial work hardening occurred in the corner regions of the tube during forming. A loss of up to 70 % of 3 CR 12 's ductility may result in the corner regions. The work hardening at the inside of the tube was found to be higher than at the outside. A region of very little work hardening near the middle of the tube wall thickness was also identified (neutral axis). This neutral axis also seems to shift slightly more to the inside of the tube with thicker wall sections. The numerical analysis confirmed the experimental observations. An excellent correlation between the experimental and numerical results was achieved...|$|E
40|$|D. Ing. In {{mechanical}} design and analysis the mechanical {{properties of the}} material used are crucial to achieve effective design or analysis. In designing structures that are susceptible to dynamic loading different mechanical properties of the material may be needed than those used for quasi-static situations. Usually when one refers to the dynamic properties of a metal one refers to the notch toughness of the material. That is {{the resistance of the}} material to crack propagation under dynamic loading. Another less well known dynamic property of a metal is strain rate sensitivity. This implies that mechanical properties like yield strength, tensile strength and rupture strain varies according to strain rate. Typical applications where these properties are of use are in impact situations such as vehicle collisions and cold and hot working of metals in the manufacturing industry. The mechanical properties of certain metallic components or structures may change when the component or structure are subjected to dynamic loading that causes permanent deformation. The purpose of this investigation is to investigate the strain rate sensitive behaviour of certain stainless steels. The steels investigated are AISI Types 304, 316 and 430 stainless steels, 3 CR 12 <b>corrosion</b> <b>resisting</b> <b>steel</b> (a proprietary alloy also known as Type 1. 4003) and mild steel which acts as a reference. The strain rate sensitivity of the above mentioned steels are investigated experimentally at room temperature for strain rates between 10 ' to approximately 100 s - 1. The steels are all tested in as delivered sheet form and testing is conducted in both rolling directions. The testing at the medium strain rates necessitated the design and construction of a dynamic tensile tester, the design of which, is also presented. The implementation of strain rate sensitive material properties into structural design and analysis are investigated and a constitutive model is proposed. The implementation of the proposed constitutive model into numerical methods analysis tools such as the finite element method is discussed and presented. The practical implementation of the proposed constitutive model is illustrated by numerically analysing the problem of a clamped beam struck transversely by a mass and comparing this with available experimental data. The validity of a typical constant velocity tensile test that is used to determine strain rate sensitive material properties is also investigated numerically to place the experimental results obtained into perspective. All the steels tested are found to be strain rate sensitive. Their behaviour is satisfactorily described by the constitutive model presented. No general trend regarding strain rate sensitivity is found when the results of the two rolling directions are compared. The importance of including strain rate sensitivity into structural design and analysis is illustrated by the analysis of the clamped beam struck transversely by a mass. The numerical results compare well with the available experimental data. It transpires from the numerical analysis of a typical constant velocity tensile test {{that it is difficult to}} obtain a constant strain rate throughout the gauge length of a typical test specimen. It also shows that there exists an optimum specimen geometry where the strain rate variation in the gauge length is at a minimum...|$|E
40|$|Several {{buildings}} at Y- 12 Plant rely on unreinforced hollow clay tile walls (HCTW) infilled between unbraced, non-moment <b>resisting</b> <b>steel</b> frames to <b>resist</b> natural phenomena forces, seismic and wind. One critical building relies on moment <b>resisting</b> <b>steel</b> frames {{in one direction}} while relying on unreinforced HCTWs infilled between the columns in the orthogonal direction to resist these forces. The HCTWs must act as shear walls while maintaining out-of-plane lateral stability. In assessing the safety of these buildings to seismic forces, several models to study the in- and out-of-plane effects were made and analyzed. The study of the moment <b>resisting</b> <b>steel</b> framed building indicated that bending stresses in the walls were induced by building drift and not by inertial forces per se. The discovery of this phenomenon was some what of a surprise in that the analysis performed is not typically used in design of these structures. The study indicated that the walls began to crack at their interface with the foundation at a low ``g`` level and that horizontal cracking at different elevations continued until the walls exhibited little bending resistance. This paper presents {{results of the study}} for out-of-plane behavior of unreinforced HCTWs infilled between adjacent moment <b>resisting</b> <b>steel</b> frames and discusses the problems of assessing the in-plane behavior given the horizontal cracks induced by building drift in the out-of-plane direction...|$|R

40|$|Physics based {{collapse}} {{simulations of}} moment <b>resisting</b> <b>steel</b> frame buildings {{are presented with}} an emphasis on the development of energy flow relationships. It is proposed that energy flow during progressive collapse can be used in evaluation of moment <b>resisting,</b> <b>steel</b> frame building behavior and specifically, localized failure. If a collapsing structure is capable of attaining a stable energy state through absorption of gravitational energy, then collapse will be arrested. Otherwise, if a deficit in energy dissipation develops, the unabsorbed portion of released gravitational energy is converted into kinetic energy and collapse propagates from unstable state to unstable state until total failure occurs. The energy absorption of individual members provides very transparent information on structural behavior as opposed to oscillating internal dynamic forces in structural members. Therefore, critical energy absorption capacity is hereby proposed as a stable failure criterion in progressive collapse analysis. Energy flow quantification is shown to be readily available from the dynamic finite element simulations. The proposed dynamic, energy based approach to progressive collapse, provides insight and a simple yet robust analysis for producing structures capable of resisting abnormal loadings and/or unexpected hazards. © 2009 ASCE...|$|R

The corrosion resistance or IA observed under different corrosion conditions was compared with common materials in glassmaking (heat <b>resisting</b> <b>steels</b> AISI 310, AISI 446 and nickel alloy NIMONIC 80 A). The corrosion tests were carried out at temperature ranging from 1100 to 1350 C for time periods 1 - 96 h. The IA and comparative materials were immersed into pure container glass, lead crystal, amber glass and in opal glass. The evaluation and quantification of the corrosion resistance were carried out by weight losses, measurement of chemical composition of glasses and alloys. Time fractal geometry was used for determination of corrosion resistance for the first time. Objective determination of corrosion resistance of IA and comp. materials was achieved by combination of these methods. The IA evidences markedly better corrosion resistance in pure container glass and similar in amber glass than the AISI 310.
