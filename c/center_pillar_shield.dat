5000|$|In 1973, the Cutlass Supreme, {{like other}} GM {{mid-size}} cars, was redesigned. Hardtop models {{were replaced by}} new [...] "Colonnade" [...] styling with fixed <b>center</b> <b>pillars.</b> Concerns over proposed rollover standards caused many automakers to phase out their pillarless hardtops and convertibles throughout the 1970s, and the Cutlass was no exception. Despite some initial controversy over the disappearance of hardtop models, the new 1973 GM mid-sized line proved highly successful. Cutlass Supreme coupes had a unique roofline with vertical opera windows not shared with other Cutlass coupes, as well as unique front end styling.|$|R
5000|$|The {{automotive}} {{usage of}} the term [...] "hardtop" [...] is most often applied for a fixed roof body style without a [...] "b" [...] or <b>center</b> <b>pillar.</b> They were sometimes called a [...] "hardtop convertible" [...] because {{they were designed to}} look like a convertible with the top raised. While some early models retained side window frames and B-pillars, by the 1950s, most were [...] "pillarless hardtops."

They consisted of wooden statues (usually of knights in armour) into which nails were driven, either iron (black), or coloured silver or gold, in exchange for donations of different amounts. Some took different forms, including <b>pillars,</b> <b>shields</b> or local coats of arms and crosses, especially the Iron Cross, and in German {{there are a variety of}} alternate names for them, including Wehrmann in Eisen or eiserner Wehrmann (Iron Guardian), Nagelfigur, Nagelbild or Nagelbrett (Nail Figure or Nail Board), Wehrschild (Defence Shield) and Kriegswahrzeichen (War Monument). The most famous were the original Wehrmann in Eisen in Vienna and the 'Iron Hindenburg', a 12 metre (42 foot) statue of Hindenburg adjacent to the Victory Column in Berlin.|$|R

The thin beltline molding was positioned lower by several inches. The rear end had vertical bumper ends with the taillight built in. Both bumpers, especially the rear, protruded further from the body.

5000|$|From 1973 to 1977, the Le Mans {{and other}} GM {{intermediates}} were much larger in size than previous models due to evolutionary changes {{that resulted in}} larger cars year after year and federally mandated 5 mph crash bumpers that added weight and length.

Body styles were all based on GM's Colonnade design for both sedans and coupes (no convertibles or hardtops offered after 1972) that included <b>center</b> <b>pillars</b> for improved rollover safety standards but eliminated true hardtop design, along with frameless windows similar to a hardtop.
