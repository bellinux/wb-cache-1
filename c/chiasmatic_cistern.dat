5000|$|Interpeduncular cistern. It is {{situated}} {{at the base of}} the brain, between the two cerebral peduncles of midbrain and dorsum sellae and continuous below with the pontine cistern and superiorly with the <b>chiasmatic</b> <b>cistern.</b> It contains: ...|$|E
50|$|The pericallosal cistern {{is one of}} the subarachnoid cisterns. It lies {{along the}} top of the corpus callosum from the {{splenium}} to the genu. It then joins the cistern of lamina terminalis which connects it with the <b>chiasmatic</b> <b>cistern.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some suprasellar tumors {{invade the}} <b>chiasmatic</b> <b>cistern,</b> causing {{impaired}} vision. In these cases, an ophthalmologist maintains optic health by administering pre-surgical treatment, advising proper surgical techniques {{so that the}} optic nerve is not in danger, and managing post-surgery eye care. Common problems include: ...|$|E
5000|$|In front, the interpeduncular cistern extends forward {{across the}} optic chiasma, forming the cistern of chiasma, <b>chiasmatic</b> <b>cistern,</b> or suprasellar cistern {{and on to}} the upper surface of the corpus callosum, for the {{arachnoid}} stretches across from one cerebral hemisphere to the other immediately beneath the free border of the falx cerebri, and thus leaves a space in which the anterior cerebral arteries are contained. The [...] "leaf" [...] or extension of the <b>chiasmatic</b> <b>cistern</b> above the chiasma, which is separated from the optic recess of the third ventricle by the thin lamina terminalis, has been called the suprachiasmatic cistern. As spaces filled with freely circulating cerebrospinal fluid, cisterns receive little direct study, but are mentioned in pathological conditions. Cysts and tumors of the lamina terminalis extend into the suprachiasmatic cistern, as can pituitary tumors, or the cistern can be partially or completely effaced by injury and hematoma or by blockage of the cerebral aqueduct.|$|E
5000|$|The cistern of lamina terminalis is a cistern of the {{subarachnoid space}} in the brain. This {{particular}} cistern lies in front of (rostral to) the lamina terminalis and anterior commissure between the two frontal lobes of the cerebrum. [...] The cistern contains cerebrospinal fluid, and connects the <b>chiasmatic</b> <b>cistern</b> to the pericallosal cistern. [...] The anterior cerebral artery and the anterior communicating artery travel within this cistern.|$|E
5000|$|These {{classification}} of cysts {{are embedded in}} the endoderm (inner layer) and the ectoderm (outer layer) of the cranial or spinal cord germ layers. They normally take over the neuraxis, the axis of {{the central nervous system}} that determines how the nervous system is placed, which allows the cysts to infiltrate the CNS tissues. They are most commonly found in the area near the pineal gland, the <b>chiasmatic</b> <b>cistern,</b> and the cerebellopontine angle space. These common places generally house extensive and continuously growing cysts. Some examples of cysts originating from non-central nervous system tissue include: ...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—Cisternal {{irrigation}} {{therapy with}} urokinase (UK) {{was performed in}} multiple institutions to prevent symptomatic vasospasm. The efficacy and safety of this therapy were evaluated, and the optimal concentration of UK was estimated. Methods—This therapy was performed in 28 patients who underwent surgery within 72 hours of the onset of severe subarachnoid hemorrhage (Fisher’s group 3, CT number [Hounsfield units]. 60). After the aneurysm was clipped, irrigation tubes {{were placed in the}} Sylvian fissure (inlet) unilaterally and in the prepontine or <b>chiasmatic</b> <b>cistern</b> (outlet). Lactated Ringer’s solution with UK (30, 60, or 120 IU/mL) was infused at a rate of 30 mL/h. The presence of symptomatic vasospasm was evaluated by changes in the clinical symptoms and the presence of a new low-density area on CT scan. Drained irrigation fluid and peripheral blood were examined chronologically to evaluate the fibrinolytic system. Results—Symptomatic vasospasm was observed transiently in 3 cases (10. 7 %) without any low-density area on CT scan. In the 120 -IU/mL group, no symptomatic vasospasm occurred. Analysis of drainage fluid suggested that UK 120 IU/mL is effective. The mean values of total drained blood volume for the respective groups were as follows: 58 mL in 30 IU/mL, 106 mL in 60 IU/mL, and 143 mL in 120 IU/mL. No abnormal changes were observed in the coagulative and fibrinolytic systems after UK irrigation...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a new method for introducing drugs into the basal cistern of rabbits. With minimal surgical invasion, we used either {{the opening of the}} craniopharyngeal duct to access the <b>chiasmatic</b> <b>cistern</b> or the suture between the basisphenoid and basioccipital bones to access the interpeduncular cistern. With our method, 0. 5 ml contrast medium injected into three rabbits was determined roentgenographically to remain in the basal cistern; histologically, all the brain tissue remained intact. Intracisternal injection of 0. 5 ml physiological saline into five rabbits had no effect on the cardiovascular system. In 23 rabbits, injection of 0. 5 ml 0. 1 % prostaglandin F^ led {{to a wide variety of}} electrocardiographic changes, including sinus bradycardia (in 43. 5 %), premature atrial contractions (in 17. 4 %), and premature ventricular contractions (in 39. 1 %). In 15 rabbits with severe changes, arrhythmia was followed by ST depression (in 30. 4 %), ST elevation (in 8. 7 %), T wave inversion (in 4. 3 %), ventricular tachycardia (in 17. 4 %), or ventricular fibrillation (in 4. 3 %). Intracisternal injection of 0. 5 ml 1. 0 % lidocaine into the 23 rabbits was very effective in overcoming bradycardia and arrhythmias. We conclude that the clinical features of electrocardiographic changes seen in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage are reproducible in this rabbit model. (Stroke 1989 ^ 0 : 112 - 118...|$|E
