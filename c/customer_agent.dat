40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{efficient}} anytime algorithm for a <b>customer</b> <b>agent</b> to select bids submitted by supplier agents {{in response to}} a call for bids. Bids might include combinations of subtasks and might include discounts for combinations. The job of the <b>customer</b> <b>agent</b> is to select the optimal bid combination. In our experiments we explore the behavior of the algorithm based on the interactions of factors such as bid prices, number of bids, and number of subtasks. The results of experiments we present show that the algorithm is extremely efficient even for large number of bids. ...|$|E

30|$|In a VCIM system, {{there are}} three kinds of agents, namely {{resource}} agent, facilitator agent, and <b>customer</b> <b>agent.</b> The resource agent here could be manufacturing unit, assembly unit, material supplier, shipping provider, etc. VCIM systems work as follows. When a VCIM system receives a product order, the <b>customer</b> <b>agent</b> passes the product request to the facilitator agent. The facilitator agent then decomposes the product {{into a number of}} independent components. After that, the facilitator agent chooses some suitable resource agents for producing the decomposed components of the requested product and also chooses an assembly agent for assembling the product. In addition, the resource agent will ship the finished components as well as product to the required destinations to fulfil the product order (Zhou et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2003, 2004, 2004, 2007, 2005; Nagalingam et al. 2007).|$|E

40|$|The Magnet system meets {{many of the}} {{challenges}} of modeling decision making for <b>customer</b> <b>agents</b> in automated contract negotiation. Business-to-business e-commerce is expanding rapidly, letting manufacturers both broaden their customer base and increase their pool of potential suppliers. However, negotiating supplier contracts for the multiple components that often make up a single product is a complicated process. Because component parts must be assembled and time dependencies often exist among operations, scheduling is a major challenge. Currently, there are no existing mechanisms or frameworks for automated negotiation and contracting among manufacturers, part suppliers, and specialized subcontractors. As the sidebar, “Related Work on Market-Based Architectures,” describes, current e-commerce systems typically rely instead on either fixed-price catalogs or auctions. However, such systems focus only on cost, which is just one factor in the complicated buyer-supplier relationship. For meaningful contract negotiations, systems {{must take into account}} other key factors, including schedule, quality, delivery performance, and flexibility. 1 The University of Minnesota has developed the Multi-Agent Negotiation Testbed (Magnet) system, 2 which is designed to support multiple agents in negotiating contracts for tasks with temporal and precedence constraints. Magnet has been under development since early 1998. Currently, its distributed market infrastructure is in place, as are the principal elements of its <b>customer</b> <b>agents,</b> which we focus on here. Magnet’s <b>customer</b> <b>agents</b> have two key tasks. First, they must determine the specific contents of a Request for Quote (RFQ), which they send out at the start of negotiations to solicit supplier bids. The content of the RFQ determines how much time suppliers have to submit bids, and constrains the start and end times for the tasks. Next, once bids have been received, the <b>customer</b> <b>agents</b> review an...|$|R

Models derived from data are generally more robust than hand-crafted systems since they better reflect the distribution of the phenomena being modeled. With the availability of large corpora of spoken dialog, dialog management is now reaping the benefits of data-driven techniques.

We characterize the Walrasian Equilibrium price space of such an economy and propose a descending-price auction mechanism, which discovers one of these prices following certain conditions. Finally, we study the strategic behavior of the owner agents in such an auction and show that following a greedy strategy is a Nash Equilibrium for the owner agents...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{negotiation}} {{is presented as}} a solution to the formation of virtual organization in domains with many parties having (partially) unknown constraints and profiles and in which the environment is dynamic by nature. The solution presented is based on the MAGNET negotiation system, for which an extension is presented, that allows for last minute changes and failure management. An efficient algorithm is presented for supplier agents, incorporating preferences, and other constraints related to existing individual plans). Combining the algorithms for supplier agents, with a simple <b>customer</b> <b>agent</b> specification, and the ability to iterate the bidding, MAGNET is extended to deal with domains as described above. A case study in logistics using real data from a logistics company shows the validity of the approach. ...|$|E

40|$|Interoperability {{has been}} broadly {{conceptualized}} {{as the ability}} of agents to work together. In open systems, the interoperability of agents is an important concern. A common way of achieving interoperability is by requiring agents to follow prescribed protocols in their interactions with others. In existing systems, agents must follow any protocol to the letter; in other words, they should exchange messages exactly as prescribed by the protocol. This is an overly restrictive constraint; it results in rigid, fragile implementations and curbs the autonomy of agents. For example, a <b>customer</b> <b>agent</b> may send a reminder to a merchant agent to deliver the promised goods. However, if reminders are not supported explicitly in the protocol they are enacting, then the reminder would be considered illegal and the transaction may potentially fail. This paper studies the interoperation of agents, dealing with their autonomy and heterogeneity in computational terms...|$|E

Currently, there are several simulation tools based on multi-agent techniques that allow modeling, partially or globally, competitive EMs. The existing tools allow simulating negotiation prices and volumes through bilateral contracts, transactions in pool markets, etc. However, these tools have some limitations, mainly due to the complexity of the electric system. In this context, this article focuses on bilateral trading and presents the key features of software agents able to negotiate forward bilateral contracts. Special attention is devoted to demand response in bilateral contracting, notably utility functions and trading strategies for promoting demand response.

Therefore multi-agents simulation is introduced.

The paper discusses in details with the design principle and framework of the simulation system. In the system <b>customer</b> <b>agent</b> is implemented as responsive agent with its response rules built on fuzzy logic, utility agent is implemented as learning agent with Classifier Learning Algorithm as its learning rules, then environment management module manages the interaction between them.
