The use of performance regulations will mean that the regulatory authorities will need to come to terms with a new way of assessing the suitability of proposals for approval. As a result of research involving a literature review and interviews with <b>approval</b> <b>authorities</b> in Australia and internationally, issues relating to the use of fire engineering, performance based regulations and computer models are raised and explored Implications for the <b>approval</b> <b>authorities</b> include the need for appropriate expertise of the <b>approval</b> <b>authorities,</b> lack of data, performance levels and verification methods, providing faster and cheaper approvals, science setting the level of fire safety and litigation.
