25|$|Dungeons maps {{consist of}} <b>connecting</b> <b>rooms</b> and corridors. As the player explores the map, the player will {{encounter}} chests or other devices which will, if opened or activated, summon monsters {{that must be}} defeated in order to progress in the dungeon path. At {{the end of each}} dungeon, there is a large room, which will usually have the boss enemy of the dungeon (sometimes escorted by a number of other enemies). Once the boss and its minions are defeated, a treasure room is opened, with the rewards for clearing the dungeon. The number of treasure chests inside the treasure room will be equal to the number of characters in the dungeon (at the time of dungeon creation). Players can thus explore the dungeons in teams. Some dungeons have special items called passes which allow harder (and sometimes easier) versions to be done. Some passes require a specific number of players to form the team.|$|E
