40|$|Hillshading renders {{a surface}} with a {{three-dimensional}} appearance using shades of gray. Although shades appear as continuous tones, they must undergo a halftoning process for use with most computer output devices. This process generally uses one pattern {{of black and white}} pixels for each shade of gray, while attempting to make patterns associ-ated with black and white pixels as difficult to detect as possible. The method described in this paper adds aspect information to hillshaded maps with oriented halftones. Twelve orientations of clus-tered-dot ordered dithers represent 30 ° intervals of aspect. Additionally, dithering matches sixteen shades of gray associated with analytical hillshading, with each interval representing 16 of 256 shades of gray.

40|$|Na primjeru kartografije autorica raspravlja o pojmu koji se, pogotovo zadnjih nekoliko godina, provlači kao crvena nit u etnologiji - kriza etnologije. Postavlja tvrdnju da pri procjenjivanju ove tehnike temelj nesporazuma između "staroga" i "novoga" usmjerenja leži u nerazlikovanju sadržaja dvaju osnovnih pitanja kojima se bavi u članku. Autorica nakon svega predlaže jednu, ne samo teoretsku mogućnost, da se na nekoj konkretnoj temi "holistički" uzmu u obzir rezultati tjednog i drugog opredjeljenja prikaza kulture (na temelju timskoga rada?) pri čemu smatra da bi bilo zanimljivo vidjeti do kakvih bi nas rezultata doveo taj novonastali, "novi holizam". The {{immediate}} inducement {{for this}} article came from the author 2 ̆ 7 s involvement with a question concerning "social culture" (from the questionnaires of the Ethnological Atlas of the Institute of Ethnology - Faculty of Philosophy, University of Zagreb). It was a question that did not seam to be very suitable for treatment by ethnological cartography which needed to be supplemented {{before it could be}} resolved. The problem itself is not being discussed in this article but it served as the spiritus movens for some theoretical reflections concerning the range of the <b>cartographic</b> <b>technique</b> and factors that influence the success of work based on it, indeed about historyness and the results gained by it, etc. The author believes that it is much more difficult to show social culture than material culture on a distributional basis and supports this by cartographic material, by the questionnaires and also by theoretical discussion of G. P. Murdock. In her evaluation of the success of works and problems based on cartography she introduces the term kartografičnost (cartographyness) to describe certain material which, to her opinion, is to a much lesser extent present in social culture which is much more difficult to wrest from context. On the example of cartography she discusses the notion which, especially during the last few years is woven like a red line, the notion of the crisis of ethnology in which, roughly speaking, there are two different views or streams in ethnology - the "old" and the "new". She expresses her opinion that in the evaluation of this technique the basis of the misunderstanding lies in not distinguishing two basic questions: (1) the range of this method bearing in mind what is being enquired into, material or nonmaterial culture, and (2) differences in understanding history with the consequence of denying the historyness of the cartographic method. The author thinks that although we use the same word, history, in fact we understand it differently, as two notions, two different histories, two histories. It is stressed that ethnological maps do not aim at giving precisely documented (near) history that can be accurately dated (to reach such history ethnological maps are not necessarily needed!) because it is not cartography 2 ̆ 7 s aim while for the more distant past this method is useful, indeed has unique inherent possibilities. The author argues that disagreements in the understanding of history (and therefore in recognition or non-recognition of the historyness of the <b>cartographic</b> <b>technique</b> or, more drastically, in recognition of its appropriateness) arise from a basic misunderstanding of ethnological theory as V. Belaj has already highlighted - ethnology having two different definitions of its subject. For reconstruction of ethnical history which derives from the first definition of the subject of ethnology (cited in the article), <b>cartographic</b> <b>technique</b> with "its historyness" can give irreplaceable results. Finally the author points out that in taking sides for this technique one implicitly gives up any holistic relation to culture and that this approach eliminates and undercuts the other (holistic approach to culture). She suggests, however that the possibility exists, not only theoretical, to take a concrete subject "holistically" into account showing the results of both approaches (by team work?). The author thinks it would be very interesting to see what results could be reached by this "new holism"...|$|R

Cartographic approaches have provided alternative malaria burden estimates, but there remains widespread misunderstanding about their derivation and fidelity. The aims {{of this study}} are to present a new <b>cartographic</b> <b>technique</b> and its application for deriving global clinical burden estimates of Plasmodium falciparum malaria for 2007, and to compare these estimates and their likely precision with those derived under existing surveillance-based approaches. Methods and Findings: In seven of the 87 countries endemic for P. falciparum malaria, the health reporting infrastructure was deemed sufficiently rigorous for case reports to be used verbatim. In the remaining countries, the mapped extent of unstable and stable P. falciparum malaria transmission was first determined. Estimates of the plausible incidence range of clinical cases were then calculated within the spatial limits of unstable transmission. A modelled relationship between clinical incidence and prevalence was used, together with new maps of P. falciparum malaria endemicity, to estimate incidence in areas of stable transmission, and geostatistical joint simulation was used to quantify uncertainty in these estimates at national, regional, and global scales. Combining these estimates for all areas of transmission risk resulted in 451 million (95 % credible interval 349 – 552 million) clinical cases of P. falciparum malaria in 2007.

40|$|Cartographic {{modeling}} is {{a methodology}} that transforms geographically referenced data into information. It {{manifests itself in}} the form of a high-level procedural programming language. As such, cartographic modeling suffers from many of the common deficiencies associated with the procedural approach to software development. These deficiencies hinder the utility of current procedural <b>cartographic</b> modeling <b>techniques</b> in dealing with complex applications. Productivity of cartographic modeling is thus diminished as the complexity of its applications increases. ^ The object model has been recognized as a promising alternative to the procedural approach to software development. This study explores the question of whether or not a version of the <b>cartographic</b> modeling <b>techniques</b> based on the object model can enhance its efficiency and effectiveness in complex applications. More specifically, this study employs an object-oriented approach in designing a new foundation for cartographic modeling with an emphasis on applications in city and regional planning. It then implements the design in various formats and evaluates the design by deploying the new foundation in several physical planning applications. It finds that, with the ability to design tailor-made objects, the object-oriented approach indeed remedies many deficiencies of the procedural approach. The major contribution of devising this new foundation is introducing an organizing mechanism called CompositeMap that sorts elements of a cartographic model into a tree-like structure according to a hierarchy of meanings. Thus, a cartographic modeling procedure can be abstractly represented as a hierarchy and referred to as a ready-made component for convenient reuse. ...|$|R

Southeastern Europe appears as an ideal area for ethnic maps drawers: there is a variety of different ethnic groups living in a relatively small area. Moreover, political boundaries often do not correspond with so-called ethnic borders, i. e. divisions between majority areas of different nations and/or ethnic groups. The history of South-Eastern Europe offers a number of examples of ethnic maps drawing and their use in political context. The paper focused on ethnic maps drawn and published {{in the context of the}} break-up of Yugoslav federation during the first half of the 1990 ’s. The maps were produced mainly by scientific institutions or under the supervision of such institutions or experts, but always with the specific goal to back and justify political standpoints of their respective country's governments during a turbulent period of geopolitical change and transition. Generally, figures and statistics were presented professionally and correctly. Map authors and compilers did not try to falsify figures. The degree of intent in mapmaking is registered primarily through the choice of <b>cartographic</b> <b>technique,</b> including certain elements of the map design (choice of colours).

40|$|ABSTRACT.

The inherent constraint of the classical set theory {{does not allow for}} partial set membership conditions and imprecise information in GIS. The inadequacy of the Boolean logic for the representation and manipulation of spatial data is a major obstacle toward realistic GIS modeling. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of Zadeh's fuzzy set theory in GIS modeling for urban land evaluation. The results indicate that incorporating fussy set theory into GIS modeling can provide more &tails about the gradual transition of urban land value than the traditional cartographic modeling approach. Fuzzy GIS modeling can also reduce the information loss by obtaining membership grade for each individual land parcel.
