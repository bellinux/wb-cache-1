40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} propositional belief merging.

In this paper, we introduce a more general family of merging operators, based on a more primitive concept, namely the conflict between interpretations itself. We show that this family of conflict-based merging operators includes many operators from the literature, both model-based ones and syntax-based ones. We present a number of comparison relations on conflict vectors characterizing operators from this family, and study the logical properties of conflict-based merging operators...|$|R

50|$|Bonfigli {{trained in}} Perugia from 1430-1440, while the late-Gothic style was still dominant. Bonfigli's {{earliest}} surviving {{work is a}} dismembered polyptych, depicting Virgin and Child on the central panel, St. Sebastian and a Bishop Saint on another wing, and what {{is believed to be}} St Bernardino of Siena and St Anthony Abbot on another. The painter's first commissioned work is attributed to the Virgin and Child with Two Angels for a chapel near S. Pietro, Perugia on March 7, 1445. He was influenced by the works of Fra Angelico particularly during his employment in the Vatican by Pope Nicholas V in 1450, where many of Angelico's frescoes were displayed in the Cappella Niccolina of the Palazzo Vaticano, the pope's private chapel. Other works, such as Fra Angelico's Cortona Polyptych commissioned in 1437, and the works of Domenico Veneziano in Perugia also heavily influenced Bonfigli's style. A <b>close</b> <b>interpretation</b> of Bonfigli's style is evident in a fresco dated 1446 of SS Catherine and Clement I in S.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} the term event-specific {{art as a}} new way to view recent art practices. It defines event-specific art as practices that are transmediumistic, participatory, interventionist and temporary in nature and are reliant on documentation, and the effects of media convergence and relational networks. These types of practices also interrogate notions of publicness, spectacle and position themselves in dialogue with entertainment and leisure experiences. Because eventspecific art is engaged in the visual landscape of the everyday, visual culture studies, rather than a more conventional art history conceptual framework is employed. Interviews with artists, curators and critics provide the primary data for this research and <b>close</b> <b>interpretations</b> of event-specific art projects are undertaken. One Day Sculpture, a recent international series of temporary public sculpture based in New Zealand in 2008 - 2009 is the central case study of this thesis.

Consequently the photographs that are most significant in everyday life are often missing from the museum setting or are misinterpreted and stripped of their meaning...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHighly {{purified}} bisphosphoryl, monophosphoryl and dephosphoryl lipids A from Erwinia carotovora {{with different}} acylation patterns were characterized physico-chemically. Applying matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, {{the purity of}} the lipid A fractions was determined, and from monolayer measurements the molecular space requirement was estimated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy allowed the elucidation of the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition of the acyl chains as well as the determination of the tilt angle of the diglucosamine backbone with respect to the acyl chain direction applying dichroitic measurements with attenuated total reflectance. With synchrotron radiation small-angle X-ray diffraction the supramolecular aggregate structure was determined, and with fluorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy the lipopolysaccharide binding protein induced intercalation of lipid A into a phospholipid matrix corresponding to that of the macrophage membrane was investigated. From the results, a clear dependence of the physico-chemical parameters on the particular lipid A structure can be followed. Furthermore, these parameters correlate well with the biological activities of the various lipids A as deduced from their ability to induce biological activity (Limulus assay and cytokine induction in mononuclear cells). These results contribute to a <b>closer</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the physico-chemical prerequisites for endotoxic activity as found for enterobacterial lipid A...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{suitable}} {{methods for}} the detection of protein complexes in protein interaction networks continues to be an intriguing area of research. The importance of this objective originates from the fact that protein complexes are key players in most cellular processes. The more complexes we identify, the better we can understand normal as well as abnormal molecular events. Up till now, various computational methods were designed for this purpose. However, despite their notable performance, questions arise regarding potential ways to improve them, in addition to ameliorative guidelines to introduce novel approaches. A <b>close</b> <b>interpretation</b> leads to the assent that the way in which protein interaction networks are initially viewed should be adjusted. These networks are dynamic in reality and it is necessary to consider this fact to enhance the detection of protein complexes. In this paper, we present "DyCluster", a framework to model the dynamic aspect of protein interaction networks by incorporating gene expression data, through biclustering techniques, prior to applying complex-detection algorithms. The experimental results show that DyCluster leads to higher numbers of correctly-detected complexes with better evaluation scores. The high accuracy achieved by DyCluster in detecting protein complexes is a valid argument in favor of the proposed method. DyCluster is also able to detect biologically meaningful protein groups.

40|$|Based {{on a paper}} {{presented}} at a peer-reviewed conference organized jointly by the universities of Montpellier and Barcelona, this chapter investigates {{the potential of the}} digital computer for the realization of 'open form' musical compositions. An 'open form' work allows the re-configuration of its constituent sections at local and/or global structural levels. While these forms were explored extensively in the immediate post-war years, Dack argues that the recent use of the digital computer for electroacoustic composition appears to have encouraged 'closed forms'. He suggests that this has occurred due to the deterministic nature of work practices resulting from the use of analogue technology from which most electroacoustic music has developed. However, many contemporary electroacoustic composers and sound artists explore 'algorithmic' and other indeterminate procedures in their work. Thus, the issue of historical 'open' forms remains unresolved and needs to be re-examined. Dack's methodology was based on an investigation into a precedent in the use of 'open' forms by a composer working in the analogue medium: the tape composition 'Scambi' (1957) by Henri Pousseur. By a <b>close</b> <b>interpretation</b> of his writings and an analysis of the realization procedures of 'Scambi' Dack demonstrated that Pousseur had in fact predicted the use of techniques intrinsic to the digital medium. Consequently, a hitherto unacknowledged model from the 1950 s existed which could be applied to the realization of works by contemporary artists. The area of 'open forms' continues to inform much of Dack's present research. His AHRC-funded 'Scambi Project' enabled him to invite Pousseur to speak at a seminar on his 'open' works. In addition, with the collaboration of Boyd-Davis (RA 2), the Lansdown Centre hosts a web site ([URL] for the dissemination of information relating to 'open' forms. This is currently the major source in English for information on Henri Pousseur's music...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} {{a case study of}} an activity, called the Oliven, that {{provides}} practice for {{people who are in the}} Arbetsförmedlingens Job- and development guarantee. The purpose of this study was to examine what it is in the Olivens activities, for people who are part of Phase 2 and 3 of the Job- and development guarantee, which, according to the participants, are working well and what works less well. We wanted to study how the participants perceive their work situation during the time that they participate in the activities. That is to gain knowledge of how the activities for people who are looking for work can be designed so that the participants can, from a salutogenic perspective, create a sense of coherence while they are participating. We have collected the empirical data through participant-observation and semi-structured interviews during two days. The analysis was made using the concepts of comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness. We have created an image of how the participants' sense of coherence has changed during the time that they have been working at the Oliven and how their experiences of being out of a job for a long time looks like. The analysis was done in two steps, a first, empirical <b>close</b> <b>interpretation</b> and then in the second interpretation we looked for themes in the text that was highlighted by the mentioned above concepts. We found that the participants' sense of coherence has increased over time in the Oliven. The reasons for the increased sense of coherence is related to the participants' increased self-confidence, which in turn are a product of they being seen as human beings and the fact that they had their skills and resources confirmed by others. 5 The participants highlighted the group community and meaningful work as the Olivens positive sides. However, some participants expressed that it sought a stronger leadership and clearer structure. We have learned that the main reasons for the participants increased sense of coherence is based on the participation and meaningfulness on the workplace which have increased their self-confidence. ...|$|E

We aimed to quantify changes in ambulatory activity following DBS-STN in advanced PD using novel accelerometry based measures that describe changes to the volume and pattern of walking. Seventeen participants with advanced PD were measured over a 7 -day period using an activPAL ™ activity monitor. Data were collected 6 weeks before and 6 months after surgery and included measures that describe the volume and pattern of ambulatory activity (number of steps per day, accumulation, diversity and variability of walking time), alongside standard measures for disease severity, freezing of gait, gait speed, and extended activities of daily living. Activity outcomes were compared pre- and 6 months post-surgery using linear mixed models and correlated with standard outcomes. The {{results of this study}} are despite significant improvements in motor symptoms after surgery, the volume of ambulatory activity (total number of steps per day) did not change (P = 0. 468). However, significant increases in length and variability of walking bouts emerged, suggesting improvements in diversity and flexibility of walking patterns. Motor severity and extended activities of daily living scores were significantly correlated with walking bout variability but not with volume of walking. Thus, the conclusions are reduction in motor symptom severity after DBS-STN translated into selective improvements in daily activity.
