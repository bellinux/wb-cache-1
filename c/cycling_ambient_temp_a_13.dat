40|$|The {{increasing}} no. {{of publications}} reflects the still {{growing interest in}} nonaq. microemulsions contg. room-temp. ionic liqs. Recently, we characterized microemulsions composed of the room-temp. ionic liq. ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) as polar phase, dodecane as continuous phase and 1 -hexadecyl- 3 -Me imidazolium chloride ([C 16 mim][Cl]), an IL that exhibits surfactant properties, and decanol as cosurfactant at <b>ambient</b> <b>temp.</b> We demonstrate here the high thermal stability of these microemulsions. Along an exptl. path, no phase change could be obsd. visually within <b>a</b> <b>temp.</b> range between 30 °C and 150 °C. The microemulsions are characterized with quasi-elastic light scattering measurements at <b>ambient</b> <b>temp.</b> and temp. dependent small angle neutron scattering (SANS) expts. between 30 °C and 150 °C. DLS measurements at <b>ambient</b> <b>temp.</b> indicate <b>a</b> swelling of the formed structures with increasing amt. of EAN {{up to a certain}} threshold. The SANS expts. were performed below this threshold. The data evaluation of such concd. systems like microemulsions is possible with the "generalized indirect Fourier transformation" method (GIFT). We evaluated the small angle scattering data via the GIFT method, for comparison we also applied the model of Teubner and Strey (TS) which was often used to describe scattering curves of microemulsions. The GIFT method gives good fits throughout the exptl. path, while the TS model gives relatively poor fits. Both, light scattering and SANS results are in agreement with the existence of EAN droplets stabilized by surfactant with dodecane as continuous phase along the whole investigated temp. range. Moreover, these results clearly demonstrate the possibility to formulate high temp. stable microemulsions with ionic liqs. at ambient pressure...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a {{new family}} of ionic liqs. based on oligoether {{carboxylates}} was introduced. 2, 5, 8, 11 -Tetraoxatridecan- 13 -oate (TOTO) was shown to form room-temp. ionic liqs. (RTILs) even with small alkali ions such as lithium and sodium. However, the alkali TOTO salts suffer from their extremely high viscosities and relatively low conductivities. Therefore, we replaced the alkali cations by tetraalkylammonium (TAA) ions and studied the TOTO salts of tetraethyl- (TEA), tetrapropyl- (TPA), and tetrabutylammonium (TBA). In addn., the environmentally benign quaternary ammonium ion choline (Ch) {{was included in the}} series. All salts were found to be ionic liqs. at <b>ambient</b> <b>temps.</b> with <b>a</b> glass transition typically at around - 60 °C. Viscosities, conductivities, solvent polarities, and Kamlet-Taft parameters were detd. as <b>a</b> function of <b>temp.</b> When using quaternary ammonium ions, the viscosities of the resulting TOTO ionic liqs. are > 600 times lower, whereas conductivities increase by a factor of up to 1000 compared with their alkali counterparts. Solvent polarities further reveal that choline and TAA cations yield TOTO ionic liqs. that are more polar than those obtained with the, per se, highly polar sodium ion. Results are discussed in terms of ion-pairing and structure-breaking concepts with regard to a possible complexation ability of the TOTO anion...|$|R
40|$|For {{a crystal}} (thickness 96 μm) of iodo iron {{boracite}} (Fe 3 B 7 O 13 I) entirely free of {{external and internal}} stresses (absence of self-blocking by differently oriented ferroelec. domains), the propagation velocity (v) of a 180 °-domain wall at <b>ambient</b> <b>temp.</b> as <b>a</b> function of the elec. field (E) was given by v = v∞ exp[-δ/E], where v∞ is the limiting velocity at E = ∞, δ is the activation field, and v ≈ 2. 2 × 10 - 3 cm/sec and 4. 3 m/sec for E = 0. 7 and 28 kV/cm, resp.; no intrinsic threshold field for ferroelec. -polarization reversal (switching) was obsd. for E ≥ 0. 7 kV/cm. An elec. -switched domain, totally or partially surrounded by a domain of opposite polarization, spontaneously resumed its initial polarization at E = O via elastic backswitching; the stable configurations of domains having antiparallel polarization involved bands of domains that were parallel to 1 of the principal crystallog. axes and that extended over the whole width (or length) of the crystal. For a given E at - 100 to + 40 °, v decreased with decreasing <b>temp.</b> For <b>a</b> crystal totally free of stress, no intrinsic ferroelec. fatigue was obsd. after > 108 complete switching cycles. When the shearing angle (J. Kobayashi, et al., 1970) was decreased, the mechanism of switching via propagation of 1 or 2 domain walls changed to a mechanism involving nucleation of many approx. rectangular domains. Owing to domain interactions arising from the mech. and elec. proximity effects of neighboring domains, the individual memory elements of a monolithic unit cannot be arranged in a checkboard pattern and operated via cross-bar access...|$|R

50|$|A thermal {{neutral zone}} (TNZ) is {{essentially}} an endotherm's temperature tolerance range. Within the TNZ the basal rate of heat production is in equilibrium with {{the rate of heat}} loss to the external environment. The endotherm does not have to use large amounts of energy to control its temperature within the thermal neutral zone, the organism adjusts to the temperatures within the zone through different responses requiring little energy. It can show postural changes where it changes its body shape or moves and exposes different areas to the sun/shade, and through radiation, convection and conduction, heat exchange occurs. Vasomotor responses allow control of the flow of blood between the periphery and the core to control heat loss {{from the surface of the}} body. Lastly, the organism can show insulation adjustments; a common example being “goosebumps” in humans where hair follicles are raised by pilomotor muscles, also shown in animals’ pelage and plumage. This allows heat to be trapped between hairs. Below the thermal neutral zone there is the zone of LCT (lower critical temperature) and above there is the zone of UCT (upper critical temperature). The organism reaches the LCT when the Ta (<b>ambient</b> <b>temp.)</b> decreases. When <b>an</b> organism reaches this stage the metabolic rate increases significantly and thermogenesis increases the Tb (body temp.) If the Ta continues to decrease far below the LCT hypothermia occurs. When the Ta reaches too far out of the UCT the rate heat gain and heat production become higher than the rate of heat dissipation (heat loss through evaporative cooling), resulting in hyperthermia.|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the rotational and vibrational distributions of mol. hydrogen in a hydrogen plasma expansion is measured using laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum-UV range. The {{evolution of}} the distributions along the expansion axis shows the relaxation of the mol. hydrogen from the high temp. in the upstream region to the low <b>ambient</b> <b>temp.</b> in the downstream region. During the relaxation, the vibrational distribution, which has been recorded up to v= 6, is almost frozen in the expansion and resembles a Boltzmann distribution at T~ 2200 K. However, the rotational distributions, which have been recorded up to J= 17 in v= 2 and up to J= 11 in v= 3, cannot be described with a single Boltzmann distribution. In {{the course of the}} expansion, the lower rotational levels (J 7) is measured to be frozen in the expansion at <b>a</b> <b>temp.</b> between 2000 and 2500 K.
