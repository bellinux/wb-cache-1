40|$|This paper {{develops}} an {{open economy}} portfolio balance model with endogenous asset supply. Domestic producers choose an optimal capital structure and finance capital goods through credit, bonds and equity assets. Private households hold {{a portfolio of}} domestic and foreign assets, shift balances depending on risk-return considerations, and maximise real consumption {{in accordance with the}} law of one price. Within this general equilibrium model, it will be shown that <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> interventions may promote an inefficient international allocation of real capital. The application of expansive monetary interventions throughout the course of economic crises maintains the domestic stock of real capital at the cost of inflation, currency devaluation, distortions of interest rates and asset prices, and risk clusters on the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> balance sheet. Exchange rate stabilising interventions have the result that the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> can also stabilise the domestic stock of real capital.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{disinflation}} in two environments.

A novel feature of the passive learning policy - compared to the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> disinflation policy under perfect knowledge - is that the degree of monetary accommodation (the extent to which the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> accommodates private sector inflation expectations) is no longer constant across the disinflation, but becomes state-dependent.

40|$|In {{the context}} of a {{standard}} model of optimal monetary policy, I argue that expectations should be treated as adaptive rather than rational. This argument is justified by considering the rational expectations equilibrium of this model as the limit point of a sequence in which agents progressively modify their forecasts of inflation to make them efficient. I show that this learning process is unlikely to occur, in real time, because of the large amount of data that would be required. When expectations are adaptive, {{there is no longer a}} time-inconsistency problem, and since inflation policy influences expectations of future inflation, the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> concern for its reputation induces it to deliver optimal (time-consistent) policy.

As a result, the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> should adopt a loss function that differs from the social loss function. Carefully designing the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> loss function with consistent targets can harmonize optimal and consistent policy. This desirable result emerges from two observations.

40|$|We use {{a dynamic}} game {{model of a}} two-country {{monetary}} union to study the impacts of an exogenous fall in aggregate demand, the resulting increase in public debt, {{and the consequences of}} a sovereign debt haircut for a member country or bloc of the union. In this union, the governments of participating countries pursue national goals when deciding on fiscal policies, while the common <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> monetary policy aims at union-wide objective variables.

Calibrating the model to the Euro Area, we calculate numerical solutions of the dynamic game between the governments and the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> using the OPTGAME algorithm.

40|$|Assessing {{the effects}} of {{monetary}} policy and wage bargaining on employment and inflation in the European Monetary Union (EMU), in the first step a Post-Keynesian competitive claims model of inflation with endogenous money is developed. In this model the NAIRU {{is considered to be}} a short-run limit to employment enforced by independent and conservative <b>central</b> <b>banks.</b> In the long run, however, the NAIRU will follow actual unemployment and is therefore also dependent on the forces determining aggregate demand, including monetary policies. But the NAIRU may also be reduced by effectively co-ordinated wage bargaining as has been shown by institutional political economists. Applying these considerations to the economic performance of the EMU, different scenarios determined by wage bargaining coordination and the European <b>Central</b> <b>Bank.</b> <b>s</b> (ECB) monetary policies are developed. It is shown that the first phase of EMU was dominated by uncoordinated wage bargaining across EMU and an. anti-growth-bias. of the ECB.

40|$|The paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} over issues concerning {{the role of}} financial stability in monetary policy. Historically, financial stability has figured highly among <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> 4 objectives, with policy measures ranging from interest rate stabilization to serving as a lender of the last resort. With the ascent of macroeconomics, these traditional tasks of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> have been displaced by macroeconomic objectives, price stability, full employment, growth. The financial crisis has shifted the focus back to financial stability concerns. Along with these developments, the shift from a specie standard to a pure fiat money system has widened the scope for <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> policies, which are no longer constrained by legal obligations attached to <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money. The paper first surveys the evolution of financial-stability and macroeconomic-stability concerns in <b>central</b> <b>banking</b> and monetary policy. Then it discusses two major challenges: (i) What {{should be done to}} assess the relevance of financial stability concerns in any given situation? How should one {{deal with the fact that}} systemic interdependence takes multiple forms and is changing all the time and that many contagion risks cannot be measured?

First we do a comparative study exercise. We find that on monetary policy committee meeting days both the ECB and the Fed can move market rates using either monetary policy or news shocks. However, {{the response of the}} long-end of the American term structure to the surprise component of Fed's statements is significantly larger than the reaction of European long-term yields to ECB's announcements. This result is intimately related to the higher transparency of U. S.

This finding is tied to the predominance of dollar fixed income assets rather than to an attempt of the ECB to mimic the Fed.

Therefore, in recent years a growing consensus has emerged for price stability as the overriding, longrun goal of monetary policy of <b>central</b> <b>banking.</b> Commonly an intermediate targeting (nominal anchor) is determined, and this determined targeting is carried out by <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> with the short-term interest rates and other monetary policy instruments to achieve the goal under the stabilization programs implemented. By this way, it is more easier to break the inflationary expectations, because a constraint is put on a determined macroeconomic variable (money supply, inflation or exchange rate constraints). <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) announced its first monetary targeting program to public in 1990, and has begun to implement monetary policy by rules.

40|$|The {{content of}} this thesis is two-fold. First, I present a {{detailed}} {{overview of the}} setup and conduction of monetary policy in China. I describe the most important participants, the goals and instruments, and discuss the concepts of independence and transparency in a Chinese setting. I show that conduction of monetary policy in China {{has come a long}} way from the Mao-era when the People <b>s</b> <b>Bank</b> of China (PBC) operated as a department of the Ministry of Finance, and the central authorities managed all financial transaction over the state budget. However, in terms of independence the ties between the <b>central</b> <b>bank,</b> other ministries and the China Communist Party are still tight and the areas of responsibility are vaguely defined. In addition, several commercial market participants have close ties to the government and should also be considered as important for the conduction of monetary policy. In sum, I argue that, the PBC cannot be regarded an independent <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> Furthermore, even though the mandate of monetary policy is given in the law on People <b>s</b> <b>Bank</b> of China, it is not clear how this mandate is integrated in the every-day decision making. In this thesis, I argue that the PBC operates under a two-fold policy goal of price stability and economic growth in the short run, but that it lacks one long-run inflation target rate. Instead, the State Council sets targets for both the inflation rate and the economic growth annually. I argue that these targets must be regarded as maximum and minimum levels respectively. I also show that the PBC officially considers the monetary aggregate, M 2, as the intermediate target of monetary policy. The second part of this thesis is an empirical analysis of the conduction of monetary policy in China. As a bridge between the two parts I present a recap on the theoretical background of the inflation bias as presented by Barro and Gordon (1983). Barro and Gordon (1983) and later literature show that a positive inflation bias could evolve in the economy as a consequence of the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> wish to stabilize growth around a level that exceeds the natural level of growth. My empirical analysis describes the difficulties in measuring inflation in an emerging economy as the Chinese one. By the use of available data, I show that the Chinese households must me regarded increasingly rational when forming their inflation expectations. Moreover, I argue that it seems like the general public finds the PBC credible, and the inflation expectations seems to follow the development in the annual inflation targets defined by the State Council. Finally, I make use of both official statistics on the inflation rate and the market s inflation expectations to search for a positive inflation bias in the Chinese economy. I show that the realized inflation in China has exceeded the inflation target for about 35 percent of the time since 1996. I argue that, even though my description of the conduction of monetary policy in China shows that many of the necessary conditions for inflation bias to evolve are fulfilled, this is a too little share of time to conclude that such inflation bias is present in the Chinese economy. Nonetheless, I show that the inflation rate has been highly volatile over the same period, both compared to inflation in other countries and to domestic economic growth. I argue that this could indicate that the PBC places a majority of the weight on output when conducting monetary policy. In this thesis, I also present possible steps forward for the conduction of monetary policy in China that could create a more stable inflation rate and avoid the future possibility for a positive inflation bias in the Chinese economy. Most importantly, I argue that replacing the constantly shifting inflation target by a medium- or long term constant inflation rate would make the Chinese monetary policy more predictable, and if communicated the right way increase the transparency of the conduction of monetary policy. The cost will be a somewhat higher volatility in output growth. On the other side, the gain will be a much more stable inflation rate in the long run, which in itself could lead to higher growth as it makes it easier for the general public to form their expectations about future inflation...|$|R
40|$|After a {{long period}} of loose {{monetary}} policy triggered by the Great Recession, some <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> are signaling that they will raise their policy rates soon. Previous research, for example, Bernanke and Kuttner (2005) and Ozdagli (2014), has shown that asset prices react more strongly to monetary policy target surprises on the dates of such a policy reversal announcement. However, we know very little about whether the cross-sectional differences among firms and sectors {{play a significant role in}} transmitting a reversal decision to the economy. First, this paper provides evidence that the financial health or industry of a firm does not seem to play an economically significant role in the differential reaction of stock prices to monetary policy on reversal dates. Therefore, when contemplating a liftoff decision, which is a reversal of a loose monetary policy, a monetary authority does not need to consider credit allocation or weakness in the financial sector as a greater concern than it considers these issues when contemplating a rate change decision that is not a reversal. Second, the paper notes that, since the 1990 s, each reversal in the direction of monetary policy has been preceded by an extended period of constant interest rates, the wait-for-it (WFI) period. The paper finds that, on the FOMC announcement dates during these WFI periods, stock prices respond more strongly to surprises in the future path of monetary policy than they do on other (non-WFI) non-reversal FOMC announcement days. Moreover, the additional effect of path surprises during the current zero-lower-bound (ZLB) environment closely resembles the effect of the path surprises during the WFI periods in the pre-ZLB environment. Overall, this pattern differs from the results in previous studies, such as G, Sack, and Swanson (2005 a) and Ammer, Vega, and Wongswan (2010), that do not find any significant effect on stock prices of path surprises when all FOMC dates are pooled. Combined with the stronger reaction of asset prices to monetary policy on policy reversal dates, this finding lends support to the prediction of previous papers regarding "gradualist" policies: a <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> that adjusts the policy rate slowly can actually lead to a very large reaction to monetary policy, as the market pays closer attention than otherwise to the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> 4 <b>s</b> medium- or longer-run interest rate target...|$|R
