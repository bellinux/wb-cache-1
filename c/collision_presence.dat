Abstract- In this paper, {{we study}} the <b>collisions</b> in the <b>presence</b> of a laser field from a novel point of view, {{considering}} {{the exchange of}} energy between the electromagnetic field and the atoms. The idea of transferringmomentum or energy between the electromagnetic field and the external degrees of freedom of atoms or molecules {{has been the subject}} of a great deal of interest during the past few years. The proposed schemes can be separated in two classes, depending on whether the light field is near-resonant with the atom...|$|R
40|$|We study n-pulse {{interaction}} in fast collisions of N solitons of the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation {{in the presence}} of generic weak nonlinear loss. We develop a reduced model that yields the contribution of n-pulse interaction to the amplitude shift for <b>collisions</b> in the <b>presence</b> of weak (2 m+ 1) -order loss, for any n and m. We first employ the reduced model and numerical solution of the perturbed NLS equation to analyze soliton <b>collisions</b> in the <b>presence</b> of septic loss (m= 3). Our calculations show that three-pulse interaction gives the dominant contribution to the collision-induced amplitude shift already in a full-overlap four-soliton collision, and that the amplitude shift strongly depends on the initial soliton positions. We then extend these results for a generic weak nonlinear loss of the form G(|ψ|^ 2) ψ, where ψ is the physical field and G is a Taylor polynomial of degree m_c. Considering m_c= 3, as an example, we show that three-pulse interaction gives the dominant contribution to the amplitude shift in a six-soliton <b>collision,</b> despite the <b>presence</b> of low-order loss. Our study quantitatively demonstrates that n-pulse interaction with high n values {{plays a key role in}} fast collisions of NLS solitons {{in the presence of}} generic nonlinear loss. Moreover, the scalings of n-pulse interaction effects with n and m and the strong dependence on initial soliton positions lead to complex collision dynamics, which is very different from the one observed in fast NLS soliton <b>collisions</b> in the <b>presence</b> of cubic loss.

25|$|A {{major issue}} in {{whiplash}} prevention {{is the lack of}} proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted head restraint could prevent potentially injurious head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the differential movement of the head and torso. The primary function of a head restraint is to minimize the relative rearward movement {{of the head and neck}} during rear impact. During a rear-end <b>collision,</b> the <b>presence</b> of an effective head restraint behind the occupant’s head can limit the differential movement of the head and torso.

40|$|This investigation, {{focused on}} a mountainous pass {{corridor}} in southern Montana, considers the twofold problem of: (1) subjectivity in action-based decision-making related to adverse weather conditions by response personnel and (2) debate over the appropriate statistical form for modeling crash severity. To address these problems, researchers developed a statistical model relating weather and roadway conditions to crash severity. Interpretation of the model findings were intended to aid response personnel by defining predetermined courses of action dependent on those weather and roadway conditions deemed to result in the lowest levels of safety. Further, modeling severity data with both multinomial logit and ordered probit methods, a direct comparison would allow the most appropriate model form for this application to be determined. Results of this effort show all model coefficients are plausible in magnitude and direction of effect with both models having reasonable goodness of fit.
