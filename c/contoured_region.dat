40|$|Abstract—We have {{observed}} that torsional vibrations can be trapped in elastic plates with circular regions of slightly thicker steps or with smooth convex contoured surfaces. An electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) was used to generate oscillatory surface traction. The resonant frequencies and Q-values were measured. It was found that these trapped torsional modes have Q-values exceeding 100, 000 with pure inplane motion, which is of practical importance for acoustic sensor applications. In this paper, a set of approximate two-dimensional equations is developed to study vibrations in axisymmetrically contoured or stepped elastic plates. By assuming circumferentially independent motion, the first-order equations are decoupled into four groups, with torsional modes uncoupled from flexural and extensional modes. Analytical solutions for torsional modes are obtained for stepped and linearly contoured circular plates. It is found that the firstorder torsional modes can be trapped in an infinite plate with a stepped or <b>contoured</b> <b>region</b> if critical conditions for the geometrical parameters are met. The analytical results are compared to experiments and finite element analyses with good agreements. I...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurpose: Despite {{post-operative}} radiotherapy (RT) of glioblastoma (GBM), local tumor regrowth {{occur in}} irradiated areas and {{are responsible for}} poor outcome. Identification of sites with high probability of recurrence is a promising way to define new target volumes for dose escalation in RT treatments. This study aims at assessing the value of multi-parametric magnetic resonance (mp-MR) data acquired before RT treatment {{in the identification of}} regions at risk of relapse. Methods: Ten newly diagnosed GBM patients included in a clinical trial, treated in the reference arm of 60 Gy and Temozolomide, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR spectroscopy (MRSI) before RT treatment and every 2 months until relapse. Quantification of MRSI was improved following the spatio-spectral regularization approach proposed in [1]. The site of relapse was considered as the new appearing contrast-enhancing (CE) areas on T 1 -weighted images after gadolinium injection (T 1 -Gd). Using a set of mp-MR data acquired before RT treatment as input, a supervised learning system was trained to generate a probability map of CE appearance of GBM. Since it has recently shown a great performance in some other brain-related classification problems, such as segmentation of brain tumor [2] or some brain structures [3], support vector machines (SVM) [4] was chosen as the learning technique. To fed the classifier, T 1 -Gd and FLAIR image intensities, Choline-over-NAA, Choline-over-Creatine and Lac-over-NAA metabolite ratios, and metabolite heights were used. The resolution of the MRI images was lowered to the one of the MRSI grid by averaging MRI pixel intensities within each MRSI voxel (400 MRSI voxels were considered for each subject). The region of CE was manually contoured on both the pre-RT and post-RT T 1 -Gd images by experienced medical staff. All voxels that enhanced at the pre-RT exam were excluded from further consideration. The learning system was trained and tested using leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) with all the patients. A grid-search strategy was employed for parameter optimization. Results: For comparison purposes, generated probability maps were thresholded with a value of 0. 5. Thus, only voxels with values higher than 0. 5 on the probability map were considered as relapse. The sensitivity and specificity of the proposed system were 0. 80 (0. 19) and 0. 87 (0. 09), respectively. For our data, standard Choline-to-NAA index (CNI) achieved a sensitivity of 0. 62 (0. 25) and a specificity of 0. 63 (0. 13). In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve also shows that the presented approach outperforms CNI (Fig 1.). The SVM-based results had lower variation across patients than CNI. An example of a probability map of relapse areas generated by the proposed approach is shown in Fig. 2. Relapse regions predicted by the learning scheme are in high accordance with the manually <b>contoured</b> <b>region.</b> Conclusions: A learning system based on SVM trained with mp-MR data has been presented. Reported results imply that this learning scheme can provide a probability map of the area of relapse of GBM in a stable and accurate manner, as shown in Fig. 1.

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that we use size-adaptive blocks to improve block-matching accuracy.

Our observations suggest that the Lemon Illusion stems from discontinuous curvature transitions between rectilinear and curved contour segments. However, the presence of curvature discontinuities is not sufficient to produce the Lemon Illusion, and the minimal conditions necessary to elicit this subtle and insidious illusion are difficult to pin down...|$|R
