25|$|As a dish, the moules and the frites {{are usually}} served on {{separate}} plates or dishes {{so that the}} fries do not become moist.

25|$|In the {{two-stage}} or two-bath method, {{the first}} bath, sometimes called blanching, is in hot fat (around 160°C / 320°F) to <b>cook</b> <b>them</b> through. This may {{be done in}} advance. Then they are more briefly fried in very hot fat (190°C / 375°F) to crisp the exterior. They are then placed in a colander or on a cloth to drain, salted, and served. The exact times of the two baths depend {{on the size of}} the potatoes. For example, for 2–3mm strips, the first bath takes about 3 minutes, and the second bath takes only seconds.|$|E

500|$|Starfish are {{widespread}} in the oceans, but [...] are only occasionally used as food. There may be good reason for this: the bodies of numerous species are dominated by bony ossicles, and the body wall of many species contains saponins, which have an unpleasant taste, and others contain tetrodotoxins which are poisonous. Some species that prey on bivalve molluscs can transmit paralytic shellfish poisoning. Georg Eberhard Rumpf found few starfish being used for food in the Indonesian archipelago, other than as bait in fish traps, but {{on the island of}} [...] "Huamobel" [...] the people cut them up, squeeze out the [...] "black blood" [...] and <b>cook</b> <b>them</b> with sour tamarind leaves; after resting the pieces for a day or two, they remove the outer skin and <b>cook</b> <b>them</b> in coconut milk. Starfish are sometimes eaten in China, Japan and in Micronesia.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{himself as}} a child, Cooper has said: [...] "I never lived the life of 'Oh, you're so good-looking'. People thought I was a girl when I was little, because I looked like a girl—maybe because my mother would keep my hair really long". He excelled at basketball, and enjoyed cooking: [...] "I used to have buddies come over after {{kindergarten}} and I'd <b>cook</b> <b>them</b> food. I prided myself in taking whatever was in the fridge and turning it into lasagna." [...] He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a ninja. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like The Elephant Man, which inspired him to be an actor. Cooper says that his parents were initially apprehensive of his career choice, but they eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of Joseph Merrick in {{an excerpt from the}} play The Elephant Man.|$|E
2500|$|Some Chinese {{households}} {{cut them}} up into small chunks and <b>cook</b> <b>them</b> with rice porridge to create [...] "century egg and lean pork congee" [...] (...) [...] This is sometimes served in dim sum restaurants. Rice congee, lean pork, and century egg {{are the main}} ingredients. Peeled century eggs are cut into quarters or eighths and simmered with the seasoned marinated lean slivers of pork until both ingredients are cooked into the rice congee.

2500|$|Broad beans, or [...] "Baghalee" [...] (Persian: باقالی) are {{primarily}} cultivated {{in the central}} and north parts of Iran. The city of Kashan has the highest production of broad beans with high quality {{in terms of the}} taste, cooking periods and color. However, broad beans have a very short season (roughly two weeks). The season is usually in the middle of spring. When people have access to fresh beans in season, they <b>cook</b> <b>them</b> in brine and then add vinegar and Heracleum persicum depending on taste. They also make an extra amount to dry to be used year round. The dried beans can be cooked with rice, which forms {{one of the most famous}} dishes in north of Iran (Gilan) called baghalee polo (Persian: باقالی پلو) which means [...] "rice with broad beans". In Iran broad beans are cooked, served with Golpar-origan and salt and sold on streets in the winter. This food is also available preserved in metal cans.|$|E
