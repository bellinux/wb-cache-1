40|$|The paper {{presents}} the modelling of hot forging and <b>cooling</b> <b>stages</b> {{in the production}} of turbine blades. The developed modelling approach utilises both numerical and experimental techniques. 3 D numerical models of the forming and <b>cooling</b> <b>stages</b> are developed considering a full coupling between thermal, mechanical and metallurgical events; in order to assure accuracy in their results, these models are suitably calibrated through data obtained from industrial trials and laboratory physical simulation experiments. The possibility of investigating the influence of different cooling paths on the final component geometry through the above mentioned models is then shown and discussed. The approach is applied to two geometries of turbine blades made of two different high- strength steels...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{development}} of the modelling approach based on 3 D finite-element (FE) analysis of the transient temperature fields and the thermally induced phase transformations as a way towards residual stress management in large size forgings. Heating, holding and <b>cooling</b> <b>stages</b> are under consideration and modelling of both the austenite formation and decomposition are taken into account. The thermal-mechanical FE model capable of taking into account changes in the specific volume during ferrite/austenite transformation is coupled with the relevant phase transformation model {{in order to allow}} simulation of the transient stresses due to both thermal contraction and the dilatometric effect. The model is capable of taking into account different boundary conditions for the heat transfer problem based on the available data. To improve the predictive abilities, the following two commercial FE codes, such as MSC Marc 2013. 1. 0 and Abaqus/Standard 6. 12, are used for solving the non-steady state 3 D problem of the metal expansion/contraction during consecutive heating, holding and <b>cooling</b> <b>stages.</b> Although all the mentioned process steps are considered, the model is dedicated to be used for modelling the <b>cooling</b> <b>stages</b> of large forgings and castings...|$|R

50|$|Even though 1960s {{technology}} was barely sufficient to produce reliable LCFRs, which are even today considered challenging, their advantages were considered compelling. Two power plants were developed independently, BM-40A by OKB Gidropress (Hydropress) in Leningrad and OK-550 by the OKBM design bureau in Nizhniy Novgorod, both using a eutectic lead-bismuth {{solution for the}} primary <b>cooling</b> <b>stage,</b> and both producing 155 MW of power.|$|E
50|$|The Cathedral Peak Granodiorite (CPG) {{was named}} after its type locality, Cathedral Peak in Yosemite National Park, California. The {{granodiorite}} forms part of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite (Tuolumne Batholith), {{one of the four}} major intrusive suites within the Sierra Nevada. It has been assigned radiometric ages between 88 and 87 million years and therefore reached its <b>cooling</b> <b>stage</b> in the Coniacian (Upper Cretaceous).|$|E
50|$|The pegmatites, mineralized lodes {{and tension}} gashes all {{indicate}} an extensional tectonic setting within the granodiorite (dated as Serpukhovian), operative during its <b>cooling</b> <b>stage.</b> This enabled the pneumatolytic and hydrothermal solutions to deposit their dissolved mineral contents. The higher temperature pegmatites most likely preceded the hydrothermal deposits. A uranium-lead dating on galena yielded Lower Permian ages (300 to 250 million years BP). The spatial {{arrangement of the}} lodes and gashes hints at a transtensional, dextral shear zone oriented NW-SE.|$|E
40|$|During heat {{treatment}} process, the distortion behavior inevitably appears in hydraulic turbine blade castings. In this research, a technology {{was developed for}} real-time measurement of the distortion in hydraulic turbine blade castings at the still air cooling and forced air <b>cooling</b> <b>stages</b> during {{heat treatment}} process. The method {{was used to measure}} the distortion behavior at the <b>cooling</b> <b>stages</b> in both normalizing and tempering processes. At the normalization, the distortion at the blade corner near outlet side undergoes four stages with alternating bending along positive and negative directions. At the tempering stage, the distortion could be divided into two steps. The temperature difference between the two surfaces of blade casting was employed to analyze the distortion mechanism. The measured results could be applied to guide the production, and the machining allowance could be reduced by controlling the distortion behavior...|$|R

50|$|From the {{theoretical}} phase diagram of Mg-B system, a high Mg vapor pressure {{is required for}} the thermodynamic phase stability of MgB2 at elevated temperature. MgB2 is a line compound {{and as long as the}} Mg/B ratio is above the stoichiometric 1:2, any extra Mg at elevated temperature will be in the gas phase and be evacuated. Also, once MgB2 is formed, it has to overcome a significant kinetic barrier to thermally decompose. So one does not have to be overly concerned about maintaining a high Mg vapor pressure during the <b>cooling</b> <b>stage</b> of the MgB2 film deposition.|$|E

50|$|The product {{must now}} be cooled and this is usually {{achieved}} by pulling the extrudate through a water bath. Plastics are very good thermal insulators and are therefore difficult to cool quickly. Compared to steel, plastic conducts its heat away 2,000 times more slowly. In a tube or pipe extrusion line, a sealed water bath is acted upon by a carefully controlled vacuum to keep the newly formed and still molten tube or pipe from collapsing. For products such as plastic sheeting, the cooling is achieved by pulling {{through a set of}} cooling rolls. For films and very thin sheeting, air cooling can be effective as an initial <b>cooling</b> <b>stage,</b> as in blown film extrusion.|$|E
5000|$|Copper is {{generally}} considered to be a soft metal, meaning it can be worked without heating. Over a period of working the metal in this way it can [...] "work-harden". This means that the molecules within the copper are compressed and irregular in their arrangement. This causes stress in the metal and eventually cracking the metal along these stress points. In order for the copper to be worked to any extensive degree it must be annealed. This process involves heating the metal and then rapidly cooling it in water. The <b>cooling</b> <b>stage</b> is known as quenching. By heating the copper, the molecules in the metal are relaxed, and thus able to align themselves in a more uniform fashion. This allows for easier shaping of the metal. In order to keep this uniformity within the metal, it is cooled instantly. This prevents the molecules from moving around and causing tension {{in the structure of the}} metal. Unlike ferrous metals—which must be cooled slowly to anneal—copper can be cooled slowly in air or quickly by quenching in water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Thermoplastics {{have very}} low thermal diffusivity, which is {{advantageous}} for some applications but create difficulties for their processing.

40|$|A report {{discusses}} {{a modified}} {{design of a}} Joule-Thomson (JT) refrigerator under development to be incorporated into scientific instrumentation aboard a spacecraft. In most other JT refrigerators (including common household refrigerators), {{the temperature of the}} evaporator (the cold stage) is kept within a desired narrow range by turning a compressor on and off as needed. This mode of control is inadequate for the present refrigerator because a JT-refrigerator compressor performs poorly when the flow from its evaporator varies substantially, and this refrigerator is required to maintain adequate cooling power. The proposed design modifications include changes in the arrangement of heat exchangers, addition of a clamp that would afford a controlled heat leak from a warmer to a <b>cooler</b> <b>stage</b> to smooth out temperature fluctuations in the <b>cooler</b> <b>stage,</b> and incorporation of a proportional + integral + derivative (PID) control system that would regulate the heat leak to maintain the temperature of the evaporator within a desired narrow range while keeping the amount of liquid in the evaporator within a very narrow range in order to optimize the performance of the compressor.

40|$|A {{model system}} {{composed}} of sorghum starch, whey protein, and FFA (palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids) {{was used to}} investigate the three-way interaction among starch, protein, and lipid. A RVA <b>cooling</b> <b>stage</b> viscosity peak was produced when starch, protein, and FFA were altogether in the system, while no cooling viscosity peaks was formed when only protein or FFA alone was in the system with starch. The height of the RVA <b>cooling</b> <b>stage</b> viscosity peak was affected by the structure of FFA and component interaction sequence, and {{a certain amount of}} FFA and protein was required to produce the RVA <b>cooling</b> <b>stage</b> viscosity peak. Both salt addition and lowering the pH of the system decreased, and eventually eliminated the RVA <b>cooling</b> <b>stage</b> viscosity peak. A true three-way interaction among starch, protein, and FFA was established, and the mechanism was subsequently investigated. The starch-FFA complexation was reduced by the presence of whey protein in the system, but the V-type crystalline order of starch-FFA complexes was increased as shown by the pronounced peaks in x-ray diffraction patterns. The ordered starch-FFA complex paralleled the formation of the RVA <b>cooling</b> <b>stage</b> viscosity peak. Starch-FFA and whey protein-FFA complexes were the two secondary structural elements in the three-component system, and a novel high molecular weight three-way complex (∼ 10 6 - 107 dal) composed of starch, protein, and FFA was also produced during the three-way interaction. The three-way complex was water-soluble, sensitive to 2 -mercaptoethanol (2 -ME) treatment, and could be precipitated by 0. 1 – 1 M NaCl. Whey protein existed in the three-way complex as huge aggregates formed by disulfide bond linkages, and starch-FFA complexes were also present in the three-way complex. The electrostatic force contributed from the negative charges of whey protein and FFA was the major force involved {{in the formation of the}} three-way complex during the three-way interaction. This three-way complex is indicated to be the structural basis of the three-way interaction as shown by its parallelism to RVA <b>cooling</b> <b>stage</b> viscosity peak formation and the well-formed V-type starch-FFA complexes. Results from lysozyme (pI = 10. 7) and other nonionic amylose-complexing agents supported the above hypothesis. A model was proposed based on the above experimental results. ...|$|E
