He was joined on the grid's front row by Montoya. Newman qualified third, Biffle took fourth and Reutimann started fifth. Kahne, Gordon, Bowyer, Sam Hornish, Jr. and Paul Menard completed the top ten positions. The driver that failed to qualify was Scott Wimmer. During qualifying, Elliott Sadler's changed his car's engine, after one failed during the session. After the qualifier Johnson said, [...] "A pole today will make the start of the weekend much better and give us a lot of direction and momentum moving into tomorrow, It does <b>carry</b> <b>you,</b> and there is an aspect of momentum. But at the same time, you've got to go out and perform." ...|$|E
500|$|Fagerbakke {{referred}} to Patrick as [...] "AquaDauber" [...] (a {{reference to his}} role as Michael [...] "Dauber" [...] Dybinski on the 1990s sitcom Coach) {{in the first few}} years of working on the show. Patrick is [...] "enormously entertaining to portray" [...] because, according to Fagerbakke, [...] "when I'm performing Patrick, there are many secrets that I could never divulge". Fagerbakke's approach in voicing Patrick is [...] "much the same way I would do [...] any kind of character." [...] "I'm always looking for opportunities to explore that freewheeling imagination and insanity of children. To be able to plug in to that and let that <b>carry</b> <b>you</b> in to a performance is such a gas, I have so much fun with that. I love kids; I raised two girls and I love being a parent," [...] he said. The cast members record as a whole cast. Fagerbakke says that the situation improves his performance as a voice actor because [...] "there is something remarkable that happens when people are working together that is unique to that." [...] Fagerbakke modeled his performance whenever Patrick is angry after that of American actress Shelley Winters.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the single}} {{received}} favorable reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic chose the song as an album highlight. Echoing this thought, Steve Beebee of rock magazine Kerrang! added that it [...] "develops into a searching, soulful hook, ranging high {{among the best}} material this band has ever recorded." [...] Digital Spys Lewis Corner labelled the recording as a track to consider downloading, further writing that [...] "'My Heart Is Broken' would strongly beg to differ, with a dashing piano riff skittling over growling guitar strums serving as a backdrop for her emotive alto-soprano." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote, [...] "On 'My Heart Is Broken', a gorgeous piano intro rises alongside Lee's vibrant vocal delivery as Will Hunt's airtight drumming propels the tune into another realm." [...] Tom Goodwyn of NME praised [...] "My Heart Is Broken", saying that it [...] "sounds quite {{a lot like a}} Disney ballad, beginning with Amy Lee cooing 'I will wander until the end of time' over a piano line straight off Powers Ballad Vol.12. It gets heavier at the end though, don't worry." [...] Chris Willman of Reuters concluded that the song was [...] "bluntly titled", while The Hollywood Reporters Sophie Schillaci called it a [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] ballad. Describing the song as [...] "fiery", Chad Grischow of IGN noted that in [...] "My Heart Is Broken", [...] "Lee's siren-esque vocals shine, [...] the band takes a few interesting chances late in the album." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe called the single [...] "a banshee howl of defiant, [...] self-lacerating rage." [...] Billboard magazine's Christa Titus wrote that Lee's voice was [...] "powerful and flexible as ever, as heard in her piercing wails on hit-in-waiting 'My Heart Is Broken'." [...] Serene Dominic of The Arizona Republic confessed that, [...] "Really, when your heart is broken, you want a song that's as idea driven as 'My Heart is Broken' to <b>carry</b> <b>you</b> through and that's what she [...] delivers." [...] Additionally, Arwa Haider of Metro commented, [...] "Standard romantic rock bluster from Evanescence. Frontwoman Amy Lee still sounds like she’d tear strips off any would-be lothario." ...|$|E

500|$|Taylor summoned Khánh to his office, but the Vietnamese leader sent Thi, Kỳ, Thiệu and Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, the {{commander}} of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, instead. Taylor asked the four to sit down and then said [...] "Do all of you understand English?" [...] The ambassador then angrily denounced the officers. According to Stanley Karnow, Taylor [...] "launched into a tirade, scolding them as if he were still superintendent of West Point and they a group of cadets caught cheating". He said [...] "I told you all clearly at General Westmoreland's dinner we Americans were tired of coups. Apparently I wasted my words." [...] He decried the removal of the HNC as [...] "totally illegal", and said it had [...] "destroyed the government-making process", and that [...] "I made it clear that all the military plans I know you would like to carry out are dependent on government stability", something he felt had been lost with the dismissal of the HNC. He said [...] "...you have made a real mess. We cannot <b>carry</b> <b>you</b> forever if you do things like this." [...] Taylor believed the HNC to be {{an essential part of the}} government, because as an American, he believed civilian legitimacy was a must. For him, the HNC was a necessary step in a progression towards an elected civilian legislature, which he regarded as critical for national and military morale. The historian Mark Moyar regarded Taylor's intervention as unnecessary, and noted that there had been many instances of fierce fighting in Vietnamese history despite the complete absence of democracy throughout the nation's history. Taylor also reminded them of an earlier meeting where he had discussed an American plan to expand the war, increase funding for the South Vietnamese military, and to go on the offensive against the communists at the request of Khánh. Taylor said the Americans would not be able to help Saigon pursue their desired military strategy if the political machinations did not stop. Taylor said that if the military did not transfer some powers or advisory capacity back to the HNC or another civilian institution, aid would be withheld, and some planned military operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail—which was being used to infiltrate communists into the south—would be suspended.|$|E
2500|$|NBC {{announced}} in 2004 that Jay Leno would leave The Tonight Show in 2009, with Conan O'Brien as his replacement.

[...] He began to regret his decision to retire in 2007, and several networks and studios including ABC, Fox, Sony, and Tribune expressed interest in his services after leaving Tonight.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1999 New York Times story, [...] "C.E.O. Round Table- Online Pioneers: The Buzz Never Stops", Espuelas {{explained}} his approach: [...] "I {{spent a lot}} of time learning how Winston Churchill ran the Second World War. I bring that up as a metaphor—not having information, not having clarity, the stakes being very high. Of course, the stakes he had to deal with were somewhat higher than what we have to do. But that was part of the encouragement—to think that something so important could be managed, and all the mistakes that were made and the chaos of the moment. And the other thing, which he said, which I love as a philosophy, is: You don't have to get it right all the time. You just have to get it right 51 percent of the time, and that will <b>carry</b> <b>you</b> through. And that's a very, very liberating philosophy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Favreau had a {{clear vision}} of heavy metal music and guitars for the project, saying that Tony Stark {{was more of a}} rock star than a {{traditional}} superhero, and [...] "there’s Spider-man, Batman and all these superhero movies. This superhero movie’s different. I want to do something completely different, instead of going down the orchestral route. I want to do more rock and roll." [...] Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra. Djawadi composed several themes for the character of Tony Stark, representing his different moods and attitudes, all inspired by Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance. Other themes for the film are [...] "not so much character based, but rather plot based that <b>carry</b> <b>you</b> through the movie". Musicians John O'Brien and Rick Boston, frequent collaborators with Favreau, provided a big band-style arrangement of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon The Marvel Super Heroes for a scene where Stark attends a casino.|$|E

Before you rise [...] a vine covered garden wall, broken here and there with graceful arches. Through the archways spreads the soft light of a harvest moon and the dim glow casts shadows over the somber colored walls. [...] Overhead myriads of stars are twinkling in an azure blue sky and soft, fleecy clouds are drifting gently with the breeze. Picture all this in your mind and you have a fair conception of the interior of the Palace theater—Marion's new half million dollar playhouse. The new theater is Spanish in design in all its details. From the walls and the mural decorations to the reproduction of period furniture in the lounges the Spanish design is followed.... the designer of the theater has let his fancy take full flight. Here and there patches of red brick appear, as through [...] the plaster had fallen from the walls. A niche in the wall is cleverly adapted to hold a drinking fountain. The view from the balcony is even better than the lower floor. As in the lower floor view of the stage is unobstructed by pillars. he balcony being of cantilever construction removes the necessity of supporting it with posts and pillars which necessarily cut off the view of the unfortunate patron who is forced to sit behind one.|$|E
