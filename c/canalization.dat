40|$|In {{my thesis}} I have {{threated}} the linear scheduling method and it`s developement over the years.

The advantage {{of this sort of}} plan is his transparent construction progress. Anytime time we know the exact position of each activity. I have presented software tools for linear scheduling and compared the making of a linear plan with or without the use of a specialized program. In this sphere were primarily implented two programs: Tilos and Dynaroad. Their main advantages are the graphical plan view, compatibility with other software tools and the ease of monitoring work progress. The main disadvantage is the inability of determing the critical path of linear scheduling method.

40|$|International audiencePlanktonic {{bacteria}} passing to a sessile state {{during the}} formation of a biofilm undergo many gene expression and phenotypic changes. These transformations require a significant time to establish. Inversely, cells extracted from a biofilm should also require a significant time before acquiring the same physiological characteristics as planktonic cells. Relatively few studies have addressed the kinetics of this inverse transformation process. We tested one aspect, namely, the contamination potential of freshly extracted Escherichia coli biofilm cells, precultured in a synthetic medium, in a rich liquid growth medium. We compared the time between inoculation {{and the beginning of the}} growth phase of freshly extracted biofilm cells, and suspended exponential and suspended stationary phase cells precultured in the same synthetic medium. Unexpectedly, the lag time for the extracted biofilm cells was the same as the lag time of the suspended exponential phase cells and significantly less than the lag time of the suspended stationary phase cells. The lag times were determined by an impedance technique. Cells extracted from biofilms, i. e., biofilms formed in <b>canalizations</b> and broken up by hydrodynamic forces, are an important source of contamination. Our work shows, in the case of E. coli, the high potential of freshly extracted biofilm cells to reinfect a new medium...|$|R

40|$|A {{refinery}} furnace {{used for}} heating crude oil showed abundant pelicules with unusual thicknesses in some pipes {{located in the}} convection zone, next {{to the wall of}} the furnace. The purpose of this research consisted in identifying the type of corrosion and determine the causes that originated the formation of the unusual pelicules. With the objective of elucidating which technological factors propitiated this deterioration, a visual inspection of the furnace was carried out to evaluate its structural state. From the values reported as thermocouples, temperature profiles of operation in the convection zone were obtained. The pelicules obtained were characterized using the X-ray diffraction technique and a metallographic microscope of reflected light. The results showed several deposits among the convection tubes; which cannot be eliminated because there isn't an adequate system of removal. This problem is accentuated by the substitution of old refractory bricks by modern monolithic panels. Such situation favored the formation of <b>canalizations</b> or preferential zones that propitiated the increase of the velocity of gases to high temperature and a rise of the concentration of O 2 on low alloy steel pipes. These factors caused an anomalous behavior of the temperatures of operation and the formation of pelicules of mill scale type, of macrocrystalline structures, constituted for few adherent iron oxides and unusual thicknesses. These results show a severe oxidation in high temperatures...|$|R

40|$|The Easter {{submarine}} alignment {{corresponds to}} a sequence of seamounts and oceanic islands which runs from the Ahu-Umu volcanic fields {{in the west to}} its intersection with the Nazca Ridge in the east, with a total length of about 2. 900 km and a strike of N 85 °E. Recent bathymetric compilations that include combined satellite derived and shipboard data (Global Topography) and multibeam bathymetric data (from NGDC-NOAA) are interpreted both qualitatively and quantitatively by using a morphological analysis, which was comprised of the determination of bathymetric patterns, trends in lineations and structures; height measurements, computation of basal areas and volumes of seamounts, in order to establish clues on the origin of this seamount chain and to establish relationships with the regional tectonics. In the study region 514 seamounts were counted, of which 334 had a basal area less than the reference seamount (Moai). In general, the largest seamounts (> 1000 m in height) tend to align and to have a larger volume, with an elongation of their bases along the seamount chain. On the other hand, smaller seamounts tend to be distributed more randomly with more circular bases. As a consequence of the morphological analysis, the best possible mechanism that explains the origin of the seamount chain is the existence of a localized hotspot {{to the west of the}} Salas y Gómez Island. The corresponding plume would contribute additional magmatic material towards the East Pacific Rise through <b>canalizations,</b> whose secondary branches would feed intermediate volcanoes. It is possible that within the Easter Island region there would be another minor contribution through fractures in the crust, due to the crustal weakening that was produced by the Easter Fracture Zone...|$|R
40|$|Changes in the {{geomorphology}} {{of rivers}} have serious repercussions, causing {{losses in the}} dynamics and naturalness of their forms, going in many cases, from a type of meandering channel, with constant erosion and sedimentation processes, to a channelized narrow river with rigid and stable margins, where the only possibility of movement occurs in the vertical, causing the only changes in channel geometry occur in the river bed. On the other hand, these changes seriously affect the naturalness of the banks, preventing the development of riparian vegetation and reducing the cross connectivity of the riparian corridor. Common <b>canalizations</b> and disconnections of meanders increase the slope, and therefore speed, resulting in processes of regressive erosion, effect increased {{as a result of}} the narrowing of the channel and the concentration of flows. This process of incision may turn the flood plain to be "hung", being completely disconnected from the water table, with important consequences for vegetation. As an example of the effects of these changes, it has been chosen the case of the Arga River The Arga river has been channelized and rectified, as it passes along the meander RamalHondo and Soto Gil (Funes, Navarra).

40|$|Introduction : Despite their {{relatively}} low area coverage, riparian forests are central landscape features providing several ecosystem services. Nevertheless, they are critically endangered in European countries by human pressures (livestock grazing, land use conflicts, <b>canalizations,</b> waste water, [...] .) andalso by natural hazards {{such as the}} recent black alder (Alnus glutinosa) extensive decline caused by Phytophthora alni. In this study UAV is used to improve the characterization of riparian areas. Riparian forest species are identified at the individual tree level. The health condition of black alder is assessed. For this purpose a computer based approach has been developped, with low needs of specific operator ability or training. Methods : We used the Gatewing X 100 to acquire 16 aerial photographs datasets (7 in classic RGB and 9 in RG NIR) during 5 days (form Augustus to October 2012). We processed a CHM in ArcGIS by combining a national Digital Terrain Model with a photogrammetric DSM generated from a single flight photographs dataset with the "MicMac" opensource platform. The 16 orthophotos were computed with Agisoft Photoscan. Based on the CHM and some basic vegetation index (mean NDVI), a classification/segmentation process was developped in eCognition allowing tree crown extraction. An amount of 113 metrics were computed in eCognition for every tree crown object. The metrics were both derived from the CHM raster and spectral information. Metrics were computed by band (object spectral mean and CHM mean, Harralick entropy, Skewness) but also with band combination (Green NDVI and NDVI). A reference dataset was also acquired through a field survey of 624 individual tree positions accurately localized. The health condition of the black alder was recorded during the field survey. A supervised classification algorithm was developed in R (Random Forest package). Results : Several classification trees were assessed trough global accuracy using the Out Of Bag (OOB) error. The best global accuracy (82 %) was obtained when distinguishing the black alder (with no regards for health condition during field survey) {{from the rest of}} riparian forest objects. The global accuracy tended to decline when other species were added. When separating healthy black alders from those with symptoms, the global accuracy is 77 %. Conclusions : Our study highlights the potential of UAV-based multitemporal orthophotos to identify riparian forest species and health conditions at the tree level. Future studies will focus on quick radiometrics corrections. This could improve global accuracy by reducing the variability caused by illumination condition...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{greenhouse}} gas emissions are responsible for a warming trend that cannot easily be reversed. This warming trend {{is expected to have}} a large impact on global weather patterns and local environmental conditions, for example by changing precipitation patterns, sea level rise and increasing tropical cyclone activity. Therefore, (sub) tropical coastal regions are expected to be heavily impacted by future climate change. To improve our understanding of the possible consequences of future climate change, paleo-archives can be used, which provide information on past climatic and environmental changes. The aim of the research presented in this thesis was to reconstruct Holocene environmental and climate conditions in (sub) tropical areas, including Florida (USA), the southwest of Japan and Queensland (Australia). In Florida Holocene environmental changes were studied in two estuaries: Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor. From mid to late Holocene, environmental conditions changed from fresh/brackish to more marine, which is a consequence of on-going sea-level rise and a relative decrease in terrestrial input. Storm deposits are more frequent in late Holocene sediments, which suggests that the tropical cyclone frequency increased. The impact of human activity in the area was studied in Rookery Bay, an estuary south of Charlotte Harbor. More dynamic and highly variable conditions during the 20 th century are thought to reflect the effects of deforestation, <b>canalizations</b> and the construction of roads in the area. In Japan, Lake conditions in Lake Kaiike were reconstructed for the last 2000 years using biomarkers and compound specific hydrogen isotope ratios. Changes in precipitation and runoff, which are related to the intensity of the East Asian monsoon, strongly affected environmental conditions in the lake. The El Niño Southern Oscillation is thought to affect summer monsoon intensity in Asia. A peat core from Northern Queenslands, Australia, was used to test if hydrogen isotopes measured on long chain n-alkanes can be used for the reconstruction of tropical cyclones. For the past 50 years the signal closely follows the number of tropical cyclones that occurred within a 500 km radius. Further down the record however, the sample resolution becomes too low to capture the variability in cyclone-activity. Still, the absence of a clear trend in dD suggests that tropical cyclone frequency and/or intensity did not change appreciably over the last 250 years in Northern Queensland. The results presented in this thesis show that changes in sea level, precipitation and storm activity strongly have affected coastal environmental conditions in the (sub) tropics. If due to human activity coastal areas are altered, this may enhance the effect of natural climate change. Whether the activity of tropical cyclones will change in the future needs further evaluation. Additional paleo-records of storm activity may help to understand the processes involved, and perhaps new approaches like the use of dD to reconstruct precipitation patterns may provide new insights. Not only water temperature but also large-scale changes in the ocean-atmosphere system, will determine whether ongoing climate change will result in more and/or more intense tropical cyclones at specific locations...|$|R
