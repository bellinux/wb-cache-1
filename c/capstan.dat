5|$|According to the inlay {{which comes}} with the Special Edition, all {{previous}} CD editions of the Primary & Secondary Phases played back slightly fast due to <b>capstan</b> wear on the mastering tape machine, {{with the result that}} the audio was pitch-shifted up by half a semitone. That was corrected for the special editions and has the effect of making the episodes nearly a minute longer.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the local}} {{authority}} promised to build 1,000 new houses {{to accommodate the}} workforce {{by the end of}} 1938, but by February 1939 it had only awarded a contract for 100. Hives was incensed by this complacency and threatened to move the whole operation, but timely intervention by the Air Ministry improved the situation. In 1940 a strike took place when women replaced men on <b>capstan</b> lathes, the workers' union insisting this was a skilled labour job; however, the men returned to work after 10 days.|$|E
5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} {{hard in the}} days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the <b>capstan</b> to raise the anchor and heaving on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E
50|$|Prior to mechanisation, {{the locks}} were {{operated}} by <b>capstans,</b> each with four poles, {{which had to}} make seven full revolutions to open or close a gate. Each gate leaf had two <b>capstans,</b> one to open it and another to close it. There were 36 <b>capstans</b> on the flight, and 126 revolutions were required for a boat to travel up or down the complete flight. With the advent of hydraulic rams and push-button control, transit times through the flight have been reduced from just over half a day to 90 minutes. The base plinths of the original <b>capstans</b> can still be seen, although the <b>capstans</b> themselves have been removed.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulically powered <b>capstans</b> were {{sometimes}} used in railway goods yards for shunting, or shifting railcars short distances. One example was Broad Street goods station in London. The yard {{was on a}} deck above some warehouses, and the deck was {{not strong enough to}} carry a locomotive, so ropes and <b>capstans</b> were used instead.|$|R
60|$|It {{was hard}} work and slow, that heaving at the <b>capstans</b> hour after hour, with the {{turbulent}} sea tossing about the little smacks, few of which were much above seventy tons burden. One {{or two in the}} fleet worked their <b>capstans</b> by steam-power--an immense relief to the men, besides a saving of time.|$|R
5|$|She left Soda Creek for {{her first}} trip {{upstream}} on May 23, leaving at the break of day and arriving in Quesnel at 11 am. Captain Browne made semi-weekly trips between Quesnel and Soda Creek until June 23 when he decided that the BX was ready for testing in the two canyons between Quesnel and Fort George, the Cottonwood Canyon and the Fort George Canyon. He left Quesnel at 1pm and upon arriving at the Cottonwood Canyon, offloaded the passengers and lined through using the steam <b>capstan.</b> However, Browne soon realized that the light and powerful BX {{did not need to}} line through and could run the canyons unaided. By law passengers were forced to disembark and walk around any canyon that a steamer was lining through and be picked up on the other side. However, by the fall of 1910, the federal steamboat inspector decided that the BX was allowed to keep her passengers on board. This gave her a huge advantage over her rivals, all of which had to line through both canyons, wasting time and fuel as well as inconveniencing the passengers.|$|E
5|$|The locks were {{suitably}} sized for Severn Trows, which were , and could carry 60 tons. The canal was not {{provided with a}} towing path for horses. Some boats sailed along the canal, but most were bow-hauled by men. Framilode lock {{at the entrance to}} the canal was a tide lock, with multiple gates to cope with all states of the tide. When a vessel arrived at the junction, a rope would be taken from it to the shore, and attached to a <b>capstan,</b> which would then be used to haul the boat into the lock. Once the canal was open, the Proprietors worked hard to improve the facilities, and a number of warehouses were built. Many of the shareholders were also involved with the Thames and Severn Canal scheme, which was completed in 1789 and provided a through route between Wallbridge and the River Thames at Lechlade. The navigation was seen as a commercial waterway; pleasure boats were discouraged by the imposition of a charge of £1 (2012:£) for the use of each lock.|$|E

During the open-boat whaling era in Japan (1570s-1900s) whales were winched ashore by large <b>capstans.</b> There, men with flensing knives {{would not only}} cut up the blubber into long strips with the {{assistance}} of these <b>capstans,</b> but also cut up the viscera and bones to make various products.|$|R

5000|$|Technically speaking, {{the term}} [...] "windlass" [...] refers only to {{horizontal}} winches. Vertical designs are correctly called <b>capstans.</b> Horizontal windlasses {{make use of}} an integral gearbox and motor assembly, all typically located above-deck, with a horizontal shaft through the unit and wheels for chain and/or rope on either side. Vertical <b>capstans</b> use a vertical shaft, with the motor and gearbox situated below the winch unit (usually below decks).|$|R

25|$|Revox went {{one step}} further: after much {{hesitation}} {{about whether to}} accept cassettes as a medium capable for meeting their strict standards from reel-to-reel recorders at all, they produced their B710MK I (Dolby B) and MK II (Dolby B) machines. Both cassette units possessed double <b>capstan</b> drives, but with two independent, electronically controlled <b>capstan</b> motors and two separate reel motors. The head assembly moved by actuating a damped solenoid movement, eliminating all belt drives and other wearable parts. These machines rivaled the Nakamichi in frequency and dynamic range. The B710MKII also achieved 20–20,000Hz and dynamics of over 72dB with Dolby C on chrome and slightly less dynamic range, but greater headroom with metal tapes and Dolby C. Revox adjusted the frequency range on delivery with many years of use in mind: when new, the frequency curve went upwards a few dB at 15–20kHz, aiming for flat response after 15 years of use, and headwear to match.|$|E

25|$|A common {{application}} of a torque motor would be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension {{to be applied to}} the tape whether or not the <b>capstan</b> is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.|$|E
