The <b>concurrent</b> <b>task</b> was associated with shorter movement times and reduced right-hand superiority. Patients with HD were overall slower, especially with long strokes, and had similar peak velocities for both small and large targets, so that controls could better accommodate differences in target size. Patients with HD spent more time decelerating, especially with small targets, whereas controls allocated more nearly equal proportions of time to the acceleration and deceleration phases of movement, especially with large targets.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the nature of <b>concurrent</b> <b>task</b> inter ference during a vigilance task and to determine whether a con-current task improves performance with decreased vigilance.

There is evidence that suggests that engaging in a <b>concurrent</b> <b>task</b> reduces the effects of monotony, leading to an improvement in vigi-lance task performance. Method: A monotonous drive in a driving simula-tor was used to investigate the effects of a <b>concurrent</b> verbal <b>task.</b> Three task conditions were used: no verbal task, continuous verbal task, and late verbal task.
