25|$|In finance, {{a common}} problem is to choose a {{portfolio}} when there are two conflicting objectives — the desire to have the expected value of portfolio returns {{be as high as}} possible, and the desire to have risk, often measured by the standard deviation of portfolio returns, be as low as possible. This problem is often represented by a graph in which the efficient frontier shows the best combinations of risk and expected return that are available, and in which indifference curves show the investor's preferences for various risk-expected return combinations. The problem of optimizing a function of the expected value (first moment) and the standard deviation (square root of the second <b>central</b> <b>moment)</b> of portfolio return is called a two-moment decision model.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} moment closure method for stochastically modeled {{chemical}} or biochemical reaction networks. We derive a system of differential equations which describes the dynamics of means and all <b>central</b> <b>moments</b> from a chemical master equation. Truncating the system for the <b>central</b> <b>moments</b> at a certain moment term and using Taylor approximation, we obtain explicit representations of means and covariances and even higher <b>central</b> <b>moments</b> in recursive forms. This enables us {{to deal with the}} moments in successive differential equations and use conventional numerical methods for their approximations. Furthermore, we estimate the errors in the means and <b>central</b> <b>moments</b> generated by the approximation method. We also find the moments at equilibrium by solving truncated algebraic equations. We show in examples that numerical solutions based on the moment closure method are accurate and efficient by comparing the results to those of stochastic simulation algorithms. open 303...|$|R

These power-law probability distributions are also called Pareto-type distributions, distributions with Pareto tails, or distributions with regularly varying tails.|$|E
2500|$|In {{probability}} theory and statistics, variance is {{the expectation of}} the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. [...] Informally, it measures how far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their average value. Variance has {{a central role in}} statistics, where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, goodness of fit, and Monte Carlo sampling. Variance is an important tool in the sciences, where statistical analysis of data is common.

60|$|The true {{interest}} {{of all these}} details about a mere book lies in the immense significance of the movement of political ideas and forces to which they belong. The true {{interest of}} all history lies in the spectacle which it furnishes of the growth and dissolution, the shock and the transformation, incessantly at work among the great groups of human conceptions. The decree against the Encyclopædia marks the <b>central</b> <b>moment</b> of a collision between two antagonistic conceptions which disputed, and in France still dispute, with one another the shaping and control of institutions. One of these ideas is the exclusion of political authority from the sphere and function of directing opinion; it implies the absolute secularisation of government. The rival idea prompted the massacre of St. Bartholomew, the dragonnades, the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, {{and all the other}} acts of the same policy, which not only deprived France of thousands of the most conscientious and most ingenious of her sons, but warped and corrupted the integrity of the national conscience. It is natural that we should feel anger at the arbitrary attempt to arrest Diderot's courageous and enlightened undertaking. Yet in truth it was only the customary inference from an accepted principle, that it is the business or the right of governments to guide thought and regulate its expression. The Jesuits acted on this theory, and resorted to repressive power and the secular arm whenever they could. The Jansenists repudiated the principle, but eagerly practised it whenever the turn of intrigue gave them the chance.|$|E
