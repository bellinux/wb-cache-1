40|$|The Vietnam {{stock market}} is a young and small stock market, but it has {{attracted}} much attention from the financial public. The Vietnam {{stock market is}} also one of the most volatile markets with 2 “bubbles” and 2 recessions within 1 year. <b>Closed</b> <b>end</b> fund is considered as a measure of the sentiment of individual investors (De Long, Shleifer, Summers, and Waldmann (1990)). <b>Closed</b> <b>end</b> fund is one of the shares that we can measure its fundamentals through the Net Asset Value (NAV). The <b>closed</b> <b>end</b> fund is traded at the discount of its NAV, and that discount is the sentiment of the investor with the market condition. However, according to the observations, during the most optimism of the stock market, there is a period that the <b>closed</b> <b>end</b> fund was traded at a premium, but in other optimistic period, even when the index boosted highly, the fund was still traded at a discount. This is not consistent with the findings of De Long and Shleifer (1990) about the relationship between <b>closed</b> <b>end</b> fund price changes and the stock market bubble in 1929. This paper investigates what drives the premia of the <b>closed</b> <b>end</b> fund in the Vietnamese stock market. In particular, the paper suggests some predictors that can influence the movement of the fund’s price. Emerging markets are attractive to foreign investors. Due to the small size of the markets, capital flows of the foreign investors influence very much on the price movement of the stocks, as well as the premia. The premia can be seen as a measure of the sentiment of the foreign investors toward the local market (Bleany and Smith, 2003). In the Vietnamese stock market, the trading volume of the foreign investors normally accounts for 20 % to 30 % of the total trading volume, and their behaviors have impact on the behavior of the local investors. And this seems to apply to the <b>closed</b> <b>end</b> funds. In the book “Irrational Exuberance”, Shiller (2000) raised the importance of the individuals’ sentiment on the stock price volatility. Vietnam is a new market which has lots of dividual investors. And their trading is influenced by the emotion This paper will show that the investors’ sentiment also play a part in driving the price of the funds as suggested by many literature on the <b>closed</b> <b>end</b> funds in the emerging markets...|$|R

The classical thermodynamic approach implies {{that there should be no}} hysteresis in a <b>closed</b> <b>end</b> pore because it assumes that the condensed phase is identical to a uniform bulk liquid and that the interface between the gas-like region and the dense adsorbate region is the same when the pore fills as when it empties. Our simulations show that hysteresis is possible and we support this assertion with evidence from a critical analysis of the classical equation. Our extensive results show that hysteresis can occur in <b>closed</b> <b>end</b> pores because of the continuous structuring of the adsorbed phase induced by the combined effects of the solid-fluid interaction and the fluid-fluid interaction...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of the hysteresis loop, its size and shape with the pore size, pore length, and <b>closed</b> <b>end</b> by GCMC simulation. It is shown that the mechanism of condensation and evaporation is essentially related to the fluid properties in the case of infinite cylindrical pores. In cylindrical pores of finite length, the hysteresis loop becomes smaller and then disappears when either the pore size or the pore length decreases according to the presence and movement of the fluid-vapor interface. A major deduction from this work is that by combining isotherms of pores of different sizes, lengths, and <b>closed</b> <b>ends</b> we can simulate adsorption of isotherms similar to those of solids with complex configurations, such as inkbottle pores. We conclude that not only the pore size but also the pore length and the affinity of the <b>closed</b> <b>end</b> play important roles in determining the shape of the adsorption isotherm and should be taken into account in the characterization of pore structure from gas adsorption...|$|R
