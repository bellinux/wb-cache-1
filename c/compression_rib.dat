30|$|Rib {{displacement}} {{into the}} spinal canal {{is a rare}} cause of paraplegia or paraparesis in patients affected by neurofibromatous scoliosis. We describe a case of paraparesis in a 14 -year-old child affected by neurofibromatous dystrophic kyphoscoliosis, treated with combined posterior and anterior spinal arthrodesis. Seventeen days after the surgical treatment the patient developed clinical {{signs and symptoms of}} paraparesis. A CT scan showed the head of the fifth rib protruding into the spinal canal with cord <b>compression.</b> <b>Rib</b> resection and posterior cord decompression were carried out following complete neurological recovery.|$|E
40|$|Starting from {{embryonic}} (protoconch-ammonitella) {{and early}} juvenile shells, which are indistinguishable at the species level, growth curves of Osperleioceras from the Reynesi Subzone (Upper Toarcian) of the Causses Basin (Aveyron, France) show a continuous radiating range of correlated variation in dimensional and ornamental characters, such as involution, whorl <b>compression,</b> <b>rib</b> strength and rib density. This covariation pattern {{can be observed}} among single-horizon assemblages, as well as during individual ontogenetic development. The existence of a continuous intergradational series of shells, ranging from stout coarsely ribbed to smooth suboxycone morphologies, rules out functional or ecological selectivity to explain this non-random variability pattern. The complex interdependence of shape and sculpture can be simulated by a model in which sculpture intensity depends on mantle curvature [GUEX, 1999]. The expression of covariation in subadult specimens since the base of Upper Toarcian reveals a rise in variability, concomitant with a size decrease, both contemporaneous with environmental instability. It developed in successive bursts from a fairly long low variability period spanning the whole Middle Toarcian...|$|E
50|$|Over thirty ribs {{had to be}} {{constructed}} (around a third being structural <b>compression</b> <b>ribs),</b> predominantly formed from bed slats, but also from every other piece of wood the POWs could surreptitiously obtain. The wing spars were constructed from floor boards. Control wires were made from electrical wiring in unused portions of the castle. A glider expert, Lorne Welch, was asked to review the stress diagrams and calculations made by Goldfinch.|$|R
50|$|The all-wood wing {{was built}} as a {{one-piece}} structure and was not divided into separate construction sections. It {{was made up of}} two main spars, spruce and plywood <b>compression</b> <b>ribs,</b> stringers, and a plywood covering. The outer plywood skin was covered and doped like the fuselage. The wing was installed into the roots by means of four large attachment points. The engine radiators were fitted in the inner wing, just outboard of the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag. The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an oil cooler section outboard, the middle section forming the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the cabin heater.|$|R
50|$|On 28 January 1917, Goodden {{was killed}} in a crash at Farnborough while flying one of the first prototypes of the S.E.5, which he had {{designed}} with Henry Folland and John Kenworthy. At the inquest on 30 January a witness described how Goodden's aircraft was seen to be making a slow turn when the wings on the left side appeared to collapse, the aircraft side-slipped, and then nose-dived vertically to the ground with the wings folded up. The coroner returned a verdict of Accidental Death. An inspection discovered that the wings had suffered failure in downward torsion. Plywood webs were then added to the <b>compression</b> <b>ribs,</b> curing the problem, and were standardized on all later S.E.5s and S.E.5as.|$|R
40|$|A {{complication}} of cardiopulmonary resuscitation A 67 -year-old male inpatient suffered a cardiac arrest. Cardiopul-monary resuscitation (CPR) was performed, followed by cardiac catheterisation and stent placement for a tight coronary artery stenosis. Aspirin and clopidogrelwere administered. Following the intervention, a falling {{blood pressure and}} haematocrit were noted. A bedside chest radiograph was essentially unremarkable. CTof the abdomen showed {{a large amount of}} intra-abdominal fluid and extravasation of intravenous contrast material on the ventral surface of the liver, suggesting active bleeding (figure 1 A,B) consistent with liver laceration and multiple rib fractures (figure 1 B). The liver laceration was successfully treated by surgery. Liver laceration is {{the most common cause of}} intra-abdominal bleeding following chest <b>compressions.</b> <b>Rib</b> fractures are frequently implicated and are often not visible on a bedside chest radiograph because of their anterior location. Impaired coagula-tion, iatrogenic or otherwise, is present in most patients. ...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we report}} a rare case of spastic {{paraparesis}} due to spinal cord <b>compression</b> caused by <b>rib</b> penetration in the spinal canal {{of a child}} with dystrophic deformity that was treated by posterior and anterior spinal arthrodesis.|$|R
30|$|Soft tissue haematomas {{may occur}} during direct <b>compression</b> trauma when <b>rib</b> {{fractures}} cause laceration of veins or arteries. Soft tissue haematoma may become life-threatening {{if the patient}} is under anticoagulant therapy. If it is arterial in origin, embolisation is indicated. Breast haematomas can be serious in direct impact or compression injuries [24].|$|R
5000|$|The {{undergarment}} {{is similar}} to a Victorian-era corset, but with less <b>compression</b> of the <b>ribs.</b> The modern-day torsolette features lace-up or hook-and-eye fastening, as well as boning or vertical seams for structure and support. It usually, though not always, has brassiere cups, and is distinguished from the bustier by its length. It sometimes features detachable garters, or suspenders. In American English, it is sometimes known as a [...] "merry widow" [...] (or [...] "merrywidow").|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is built}} of welded steel tube and is fabric covered. The wings consist of two solid spruce spars, built up wooden <b>ribs,</b> <b>compression</b> struts and internal bracing. The Parasol's empennage is built of wood, the tailplane being externally braced. Two five gallon fuel tanks are {{installed at the}} root end of each wing, the fuel being gravity fed. The only tools necessary to assemble one of the Parasol kits were a pair of small pliers, screwdriver, hacksaw (with plenty of blades), hammer, small hand drill, chisel, center punch, file and drill.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cerebellar and {{cerebral}} infarctions {{caused by}} the syndrome of cervical rib with thrombosis of subclavian artery are very unusual. Case presentation We report {{the case of a}} 49 -year-old male patient with a right cervical <b>rib</b> <b>compression</b> leading to subclavian arterial thrombosis and both cerebellar and cerebral infarctions secondary to retrograde thromboembolisation. Follow-up imaging revealed partial resolution of the thrombosis after combined anti-coagulant and anti-platelet therapy. The cervical rib and first costa were surgically removed to prevent additional events. Conclusion Cervical <b>rib</b> vascular <b>compression</b> should be promptly diagnosed and treated in order to avoid further complications, including cerebrovascular ischemic events. </p...|$|R
40|$|COPD and {{osteoporosis}} {{are strongly}} associated because of common risk {{factors such as}} age, smoking, and inactivity. In addition, COPD-related systemic inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, {{and the use of}} systemic corticosteroids enhance ongoing bone destruction. Osteoporosis, in turn, may cause fragility fractures, which further impair mobility and increase morbidity and mortality. Vertebral <b>compression</b> fractures and <b>rib</b> cage fractures in patients with COPD may also reduce pulmonary function or enhance exacerbations. Early prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in COPD is, therefore, important and should be based on integrated risk assessment tools such as FRAX, which take bone mineral density, history of fragility fractures, and population-specific clinical factors into account. As long as intervention studies focusing on the bone in COPD are lacking, a more rigorous application of existing treatment guidelines of osteoporosis in general is mandatory. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Forensic {{biomechanics}} {{is increasingly}} {{being used to}} explain how observed injuries occur. We studied infant rib fractures from a biomechanical and morphological perspective using a porcine model. Methods: We used 24, 6 th ribs of one day old domestic pigs Sus scrofa, divided into three groups, desiccated (representing post-mortem trauma), fresh ribs with intact periosteum (representing peri-mortem trauma) and those stored at - 20. °C. Two experiments were designed to study their biomechanical behaviour fracture morphology: ribs were axially compressed and subjected to four-point bending in an Instron 3339 fitted with custom jigs. Morphoscopic analysis of resultant fractures consisted of standard optical methods, micro-CT (μCT) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Results: During axial <b>compression</b> fresh <b>ribs</b> did not fracture because of energy absorption capabilities of their soft and fluidic components. In flexure tests, dry ribs showed typical elastic-brittle behaviour with long linear load-extension curves, followed by short non-linear elastic (hyperelastic) behaviour and brittle fracture. Fresh ribs showed initial linear-elastic behaviour, followed by strain softening and visco-plastic responses. During the course of loading, dry bone showed minimal observable damage prior to the onset of unstable fracture. Frozen then thawed bone showed similar patterns to fresh bone. Morphologically, fresh ribs showed extensive periosteal damage to the tensile surface with areas of collagen fibre pull-out along the tensile surface. While all dry ribs fractured precipitously, with associated fibre pull-out, the latter feature was absent in thawed ribs. Conclusions: Our study highlights the fact that under controlled loading, fresh piglet ribs (representing perimortem trauma) did not fracture through bone, but was associated with periosteal tearing...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies on high impact fractures of ribs, {{little is known}} about compressive rib injuries. We studied rib fractures from a biomechanical and morphological perspective using 15, 5 th ribs of domestic pigs Sus scrofa, divided into two groups, desiccated (representing post-mortem trauma) and fresh ribs with intact periosteum (representing peri-mortem trauma). Ribs were axially compressed and subjected to four-point bending in an Instron 3339 fitted with custom jigs. Morphoscopic analysis of resultant fractures consisted of standard optical methods, micro-CT (μCT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). During axial <b>compression,</b> fresh <b>ribs</b> had slightly higher strength because of energy absorption capabilities of their soft and fluidic components. In flexure tests, dry ribs showed typical elastic-brittle behaviour with long linear load-extension curves, followed by relatively short non-linear elastic (hyperelastic) behaviour and brittle fracture. Fresh ribs showed initial linear-elastic behaviour, followed by strain softening, visco-plastic responses. During the course of loading, dry bone showed minimal observable damage prior to the onset of unstable fracture. In contrast, fresh bone showed buckling-like damage features on the compressive surface and cracking parallel to the axis of the bone. Morphologically, all dry ribs fractured precipitously, whereas {{all but one of the}} fresh ribs showed incomplete fracture. The mode of fracture, however, was remarkably similar for both groups, with butterfly fractures predominating (7 / 15, 46. 6 % dry and wet). Our study highlights the fact that under controlled loading, despite seemingly similar butterfly fracture morphology, fresh ribs (representing perimortem trauma) show a non-catastrophic response...|$|R
40|$|A 25 -year {{retrospective}} study {{of cases of}} crush/traumatic asphyxia autopsied at Forensic Science SA, Adelaide, Australia from 1980 to 2004 was undertaken. A total of 79 cases of crush asphyxia was found consisting of 63 males (80 %) and 16 females (20 %). The age range of the males was 19 - 86 years (mean= 41. 8 years) and of the females was 19 - 75 years (mean= 38. 6 years). In 18 cases the exact circumstances of death were unclear, leaving 61 cases in which details of the fatal episode were available. Major categories included vehicle crashes (N= 37), industrial accidents (N= 9), farm accidents (N= 6) and entrapment beneath vehicles (N= 5). Forty of the 79 victims (51 %) had only very minor bruises and abrasions; 28 (35 %) had evidence of chest <b>compression</b> with <b>rib</b> and sternal fractures and large areas of soft tissue bruising of the chest; 7 cases (9 %) had other significant injuries or findings that had contributed to death. All of these victims had signs of crush asphyxia {{in the form of}} intense purple congestion and swelling of the face and neck, and/or petechial hemorrhages of the skin of the face and/or conjunctivae. The pattern of pathological findings of crush asphyxia was not influenced by {{the presence or absence of}} concomitant serious or lethal injuries. In 4 cases (5 %) where the circumstances of the lethal episode were those of crush asphyxia there were no characteristic pathological findings. This study has shown that a high percentage of crush asphyxias may be caused by vehicle accidents. It has also demonstrated that on occasion fatal crush asphyxia may have to be a diagnosis of exclusion, made only when there are characteristic death scene findings, and no evidence of lethal natural diseases or injuries at autopsy, with negative toxicological screening...|$|R
30|$|The {{definition}} of the bond-slip law in reinforced concrete structures {{is very important in}} the context of a correct evaluation of deformability, ductility and crack evolution (opening and spacing). Rehm (1961) experimentally showed that the stress arising at the bar-concrete interface depends on the relative sliding, generated between the bar and the surrounding concrete. The bond failure of the adhesion may occur with the propagation of the splitting cracks through the concrete cover (splitting failure) or with the crisis of the concrete corbels (in <b>compression)</b> between the <b>ribs</b> (pull-out failure). The bond strength and the failure modes generally depend on the effectiveness of the confinement provided by the concrete cover and the distance between the bars (Ferguson et al. 1954; Morita and Kaku 1979) and by the transverse reinforcement (Orangun et al. 1977; Kemp and Wilhelm 1979; Skorogobatov and Edwards 1979; Morita and Kaku 1979, Morita and Fujii 1982). The influence of the relative rib area and bar diameter on the local bond behaviour is pointed out in (Metelli and Plizzari 2014). Different authors (Rehm 1961; Eligehausen et al. 1983; Shima et al. 1987; Giuriani et al. 1991; Cairns and Jones 1996; Gambarova and Rosati 1997; Yasojima and Kanakubo 2008) proposed analytical formulations for the bond-slip behavior based on experimental results.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss the classification, diagnosis, pathophysiology and management of Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a complex entity that is characterized by different neurovascular signs and symptoms involving the upper limb. TOS is defined as upper extremity symptoms due to compression of the neurovascular bundle in the area of the neck just above the first <b>rib.</b> <b>Compression</b> is thought to occur at one or more of the three anatomical compartments: the interscalene triangle, the costoclavicular space and the retropectoralis minor spaces. The clinical presentation can include both neurogenic and vascular symptoms. TOS can be difficult to diagnose because there is no standardized objective test that can be used and the clinician must rely on history and several positive findings on physical exam. The medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve conduction may be a sensitive way to detect pathology in the lower trunks of the brachial plexus which is promising for future research. Treatment options continue to be conservative and surgical. However, for those who have failed physical therapy there is research to suggest that botulinum toxin may help with symptom relief. However, given that there has been conflicting evidence, further research is required using randomized controlled trials...|$|R
40|$|Blunt {{thoracic}} trauma {{followed by}} aortic rupture (BTAR), {{is a unique}} injury to the aorta (which is the main output of blood from the heart). BTAR could be explained as a <b>compression</b> of the <b>rib</b> cage, (produced by a trauma to the chest), which affects the internal organs and injure the aorta in a specific spot. This thesis work will analyze the mechanism of this injury. A hypothesis has been developed to explain the mechanism of BTAR, if the mechanism is known an external device could be designed to prevent it. In this thesis, numerical simulations will be performed {{as a way to}} recreate BTAR and prove that the mechanism is not due to only one assumption, instead of being a complex trauma, it triggers different mechanisms. The study starts with an explanation of the trauma and a rough rationale for the mechanisms proposed in this work. Literature has been reviewed marking the starting point for this research. This first chapter concludes with the methodology that will take place and how will be studied throughout the chapters. A validation of the mechanical properties and material model is performed on the first simulation of the second chapter. Once the mechanical properties and material model have been validated, a simulation to prove the first mechanism proposed is performed. A scar at the inner aspect of the aortic isthmus will generate a concentration of stress, if the tissue is subjected to an increment of pressure. A simulation of a bubble inflation test with the insertion of a patch, which varies in diameter and stiffness is performed on this second chapter, finding an intensity factor of 1. 53, 1. 43 and 1. 66 in diameters of 1 mm, 2 mm and 3 mm respectively, these values represents a concentration of stress and strain at the border of the patch and the aorta. This is shown in the second chapter which validates the mechanism that a scar at the aortic isthmus, due to the closure of the Ductus Arteriosus, will weaken the aortic wall. The third chapter compares two ways of geometry generation. With an increment of internal pressure first in a high pressure range having the highest error before 150 kPa, hence a normal physiological pressure range was simulated and a dramatic increase of errors started at 18. 7 kPa, the outermost layer of the aorta shows the highest values. To achieve these a 10 mm specimen from the descending aorta was generated by two methods; a geometric approximated model designed with a Computational Assisted Design software, and a segmented model, which was designed by segmenting 3 D medical images. The simulation of the third chapter demonstrates that the aorta changes its cross section when it is subjected to hypertension values, therefore the fourth chapter tests the architecture of the thoracic aorta when is subjected to a pressure range which includes the different levels of hypertension. For this analysis the aorta is divided into four different sections, ascending aorta, descending aorta, external aortic isthmus and internal aortic isthmus. The internal part of the aortic isthmus, at the innermost layer, shows higher stress values with less displacement. On the displacement analysis, the descending aorta shows a value at 18. 7 kPa of 0. 6 x 10 ^- 3 m and the internal part of the aortic isthmus of 0. 2 x 10 ^- 3 m, for the stress values the descending aorta shows a value of 0. 4 MPa and the internal part of the aortic isthmus of 0. 35 MPa. The last chapter employs the finite element method with a fluid solid interaction, and a smooth particle hydrodynamics formulation for the blood. This simulation uses a geometric approximation of the chest including the sternum and spine, heart and a three layered aorta. This model is subjected to different values of speed, introduced at the sternum, which will compress the heart recreating a blunt thoracic trauma. For this analysis, the aorta is also divided into the same zones as in the fourth chapter. It is shown that at a velocity of 20 m x s^- 1 values of pressure higher than 270 kPa (rupture pressure validated on the second chapter) and stress values higher than 1819. 2 kPa experimental minimum ultimate stress [Pearson et. al., 2008] (tested and validated on the second chapter) are located at the inner aspect of the aortic isthmus of the intima layer. When the four results chapters are analysed together, {{it can be seen that}} the architecture of the aorta changes during hypertension values, and the concentration of stress and strain changes from the adventitia layer to the Intima layer, due to the change of the cross section geometry. This thesis concludes that a mechanism of a BTAR is too complex to explain only by one mechanism, therefore a conjunction of numerical simulations test and validate a multivariate hypothesis proposed. The limitations of this thesis are also explored in the final chapter, with a proposal of a future work, to keep track with the research, and could design an external device to prevent people from dying in car crashes due to BTAR...|$|R
