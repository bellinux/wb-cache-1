30|$|The {{treatment}} of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in elderly osteopenic patients, {{especially those who}} cannot follow limited weight bearing instructions, is controversial. Recent publications indicate concern with excessive sliding of telescoping nail or sliding screw devices when used in these unstable intertrochanteric fractures. In our experience {{with the use of}} intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) in these fracture patterns, we have observed excessive sliding and collapse of the fracture in some patients. We modified the keyed <b>centering</b> <b>sleeve</b> by threading its internal distal third and substituted the compression screw with a custom bolt to obtain restricted sliding or rigid fixation depending on the gap between the lag screw and custom bolt. We used this modified system in static configuration to treat five patients who had an unstable intertrochanteric fracture of the femur. The length of the involved limb measured at the time of consolidation showed no shortening. In view of these results, intertrochanteric hip fractures that are unstable in patients with poor bone-stock can be fixed using the modified IMHS in a static or controlled sliding configuration.|$|E

50|$|One common {{issue with}} the PT01 (and similar models) is {{inconsistent}} playback speeds. The most likely culprit is usually dirty, poor quality lubricants around the center spindle. To resolve, remove the C-clip from the spindle, lift the platter (being careful not to damage the belt) and thoroughly clean the spindle. Also clean the surrounding areas and <b>center</b> <b>sleeve</b> of the platter with proper solvents, then apply an even coat of lithium grease. Doing so {{is the most common}} method of resolving these slowdown issues.|$|R

40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer death in Japan as well as in the United States. While {{surgical}} resection offers the best chance of a cure for those with ear-ly-stage lung cancer, less invasive surgeries including pulmonary parenchymal-sparing procedures and minimum invasive surgical approaches, are important for quality of postoperative life [1]. Is there a subset of patients in whom sublobar resection is appropriate for the treat-ment of lung cancer? Sublobar resection including segmentectomy as an alternative to lobectomy may be appropriate not only in patients with compromised pulmonary func-tion but also in patients who are able to tolerate a lobectomy [2 - 5] this is a sig-nificantissue in an era when computed tomographic investigation is so accurate and preoperative diagnosis of lung malignancy is so specific that more and more small-sized lung cancers are diagnosed [6]. Recently, segmentectomy as well as wedge resection is reported to offer significantly better functional preservation compared with lobectomy [2, 7]. Sleeve lobectomy is now a routine procedure in experienced thoracic surgery <b>centers.</b> <b>Sleeve</b> resection is at present the surgical treatment of choice when anatomi-cally feasible even in patients with good cardiopulmonary function. Sleeve resection also bears indisputable functional advantages over pneumonectomy: no increased rates of complications, reduced mortality, and equal if not better long-term oncological results.
