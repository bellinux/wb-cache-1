50|$|When {{decimation}} {{is performed}} on {{a sequence of}} samples of a signal or other continuous function, it produces an approximation of the sequence {{that would have been}} obtained by sampling the signal at a lower rate (or density, {{as in the case of}} a photograph). The decimation factor is usually an integer or a rational fraction greater than one. This factor multiplies the sampling interval or, equivalently, divides the sampling rate.

50|$|There {{have been}} moves by the {{recording}} industry to make <b>audio</b> CDs (<b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> Digital <b>Audio)</b> unplayable on computer CD-ROM drives, to prevent the copying of music.

Consumer rights advocates as of October 2001 pushed to require warning labels on <b>compact</b> <b>discs</b> that {{do not conform to}} the official <b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> Digital <b>Audio</b> standard (often called the Red Book) to inform consumers which discs do not permit full fair use of their content.|$|R
50|$|In {{digital signal}} processing, upsampling {{can refer to}} the entire process of {{increasing}} the sampling rate of a signal, or it can refer to just one step of the process, the other step being interpolation. Complementary to decimation, which decreases sampling rate, it is a specific case of sample rate conversion in a multi-rate digital signal processing system. When upsampling is performed on a sequence of samples of a signal or other continuous function, it produces an approximation of the sequence {{that would have been}} obtained by sampling the signal at a higher rate (or density, {{as in the case of}} a photograph). For example, if <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> <b>audio</b> at 44,100 samples/second is upsampled by a factor of 5/4, the resulting sample-rate is 55,125.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With a {{standard}} compact disc (CD) audio player, the only possibility for the user is {{to listen to}} the recorded track, passively: the interaction is limited to changing the global volume or the track. Imagine now that the listener can turn into a musician, playing with the sound sources present in the stereo mix, changing their respective volumes and locations in space. For example, a given instrument or voice can be either muted, amplified, or more generally moved in the acoustic space. This will be a kind of generalized karaoke, useful for disc jockeys and also for music pedagogy (when practicing an instrument). This demonstration shows that this dream has come true, with active CDs fully backward compatible while enabling interactive music. The magic is that “the mu-sic is in the sound”: the structure of the mix is embedded in the sound signal itself, using audio watermarking techniques (patent pending). Key words: interactive music, <b>compact</b> <b>disc,</b> <b>audio</b> watermarking, source separation, sound spatializatio...|$|E
40|$|While rich {{support for}} a wide variety of media such as text, video and image is common among {{contemporary}} hypermedia systems, so too is the inadequate {{support for a}}udio. The primary reason that audio has not attracted as much attention as other media can be attributed to its obvious lack of visual identity. The main focus of this work was to identify a generic and meaningful visual representation of audio within a hypermedia context, and significantly promote hypermedia support for audio through the provision of a sound viewer. This paper describes the inherent difficulties in providing a consistent interface to audio, and discusses in some depth the issues raised during the development process. The sound viewer is then introduced and the associated concepts described. The creation and traversal of links to and from audio are facilitated by the sound viewer across formats including WAV (proprietary digital sound file format from Microsoft), CD (<b>Compact</b> <b>Disc)</b> <b>Audio</b> and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface). The resultant viewer provides a unified and extensible framework for interacting with audio from within an open hypermedia environment. The open hypermedia system Microcosm was used as the development platform for this work. Microcosm can be augmented to supply a hypermedia link service to additional media with minimal overhead...|$|E

40|$|A new technique, {{based on}} current compact disc technology, to image the {{transparent}} surface of a compact disc, or additionally the reflective information layer, has been designed, implemented and evaluated. This technique (image capture technique) has been tested and successfully applied to the detection of mechanically introduced compact disc watermarks and biometrical information with a resolution of 1. 6 um x l 4 um. Software has been written which, when used with the image capture technique, recognises a compact disc based on its error distribution. The software detects digital watermarks which cause either laser signal distortions or decoding error events. Watermarks serve as secure media identifiers. The complete channel coding of a <b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Audio</b> system including EFM modulation, error-correction and interleaving have been implemented in software. The performance of the error correction system of the compact disc has been assessed using this simulation model. An embedded data channel holding watermark data has been investigated. The covert channel is implemented {{by means of the}} error-correction ability of the Compact Disc system and was realised by aforementioned techniques like engraving the reflective layer or the polysubstrate layer. Computer simulations show that watermarking schemes, composed of regularly distributed single errors, impose a minimum effect on the error correction system. Error rates increase by a factor of ten if regular single-symbol errors per frame are introduced - all other patterns further increase the overall error rates. Results show that background signal noise has to be reduced by a factor of 60 % to account for the additional burden of this optimal watermark pattern. Two decoding strategies, usually employed in modern CD decoders, have been examined. Simulations take emulated bursty background noise as it appears in user-handled discs into account. Variations in output error rates, depending on the decoder and the type of background noise became apparant. At low error rates {r < 0. 003) the output symbol error rate for a bursty background differs by 20 % depending on the decoder. Differences between a typical burst error distribution caused by user-handling and a non-burst error distribution {{has been found to be}} approximately 1 % with the higher performing decoder. Simulation results show that the drop of the error-correction rates due to the presence of a watermark pattern quantitatively depends on the characteristic type of the background noise. A four times smaller change to the overall error rate was observed when adding a regular watermark pattern to a characteristic background noise, as caused by user-handling, compared to a non-bursty background...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The major {{purpose of}} the {{research}} in this thesis is {{to add to the}} available knowledge on advanced violin playing of the Romantic Period by, firstly, investigating the historical and technical knowledge and, secondly, adding some of my own findings. The project consists of a thesis, five recordings of live performances by the candidate and a guide to those performances. The development of violin techniques in the {{nineteenth and early twentieth centuries}} and the role of the instrument in expressing the musical ideals of the age were chosen to study because there is a general lack of literature on the subject written by players who have performed the music chosen by the researcher. Furthermore, studies of this literature have left some important questions unanswered. One such question concerned how the development of the violin allowed musicians to better express the music in that era. Another question is what kinds of techniques were developed and how they related to the expression of the music. The thesis includes a study of the historical background of the Romantic period, as well as instrument development in this period. Analyses are made of the music considering techniques only where they are new techniques which considers the expressive reasons lying behind the new styles of writing. Treatises, violin methods, as well as modern studies are examined and compared in order to determine the development of violin techniques specifically in the period. This study is an investigation of both the written literature and the experiences of playing Romantic violin pieces in five concert situations, conducted over a time span of four years. The first concert presented a programme of German composer Robert Schumann’s Violin Sonata No. 1 in A minor Op. 105; with French composer Camille Saint-Saёns’ Havanaise Op. 83; and also Fritz Kreisler-‘Pugnani’s’ Praeludium und Allegro. The second concert presented a programme of Schubert’s Sonata in A major Op. 162 and Prokofiev’s Sonata No. 2 in D major Op. 94 a. The third concert presented a programme of Brahms’ Sonata No. 3 in D minor Op. 108 with Tchaikovsky’s Three Pieces Op. 42. It also included Ravel’s Tzigane. The fourth concert programme presented Beethoven’s Piano Trio No. 1 in D major Op. 70, commonly called “The Ghost”. The fifth concert presented a programme of Brahms’ Sonata No. 1 in G major Op. 78 and also the Sonata No. 2 in A major Op. 100. In addition his Sonatensatz (Scherzo) in C minor was performed. For each of these concerts, the researcher made written reports detailing the reasons behind the choice of each piece, the place of the piece in the context of the research and an examination of the effectiveness of the concert recital programme. The reports included notes on the mastery of the different new violin techniques required to play the piece with an historic awareness. As evidence of this, each concert was recorded onto <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> <b>audio</b> format. The reports were used as a basis for the accompanying Guide to Performance. This is a work of critical analysis and aims to give a record of the progress of the research through performance. It documents the gradual discovery of how the historical theory can be realised in practice and provides a rationale for the techniques and strategies adopted in the creative component. The appendices include lists of repertoire and composers of the period, a chart of significant events from the period relating to the violin, and a chart of some of the key genealogical relationships in violin pedagogy. The investigation of violin techniques of Romanticism produced a number of major results. One important finding suggests that there are solutions to the difficult technical passages, which require an understanding of the historical context and literary background. In summary, this research produced findings which are of significance to violin educators and advanced violin students...|$|E
