We examined the distribution of the newly born stars with respect to the cloud itself.

We also identify two objects without H-alpha emission that could be planetary mass members of <b>Chamaeleon</b> <b>II.</b> In Corona Australis, we find ten stars and three brown dwarf candidates in the Coronet cluster. Five of our new members are identified with ISOCAM sources. Only two of them have a mid-infrared excess, indicating the presence of an accretion disk.

40|$|Prevalence of {{egg-laying}} {{disorders and}} hematology and blood chemical parameters were analyzed in free-ranging common chameleons (<b>Chamaeleo</b> <b>chamaeleon)</b> from southern Spain. During four reproductive seasons oviposition failures occurred only during dry years. Egg binding {{appeared to be}} an important cause of mortality. Oviductal eggs of dystocic females were longer and wider than those of females with normal oviposition. Blood cell counts, white blood cell differentials, hematocrit, and concentration of hemoglobin, total plasma protein, glucose, uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine phosphokinase in blood were determined for eight apparently healthy post-reproductive females and considered as reference values. These chameleons differed from other reptiles in high concentrations of glucose in blood, averaging 362 mg/dl, and in high numbers of heterophils. Females with dystocia differed from reference values in an increase in monocytes and in the high concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase probably associated with tissue trauma.

40|$|Effect of cold {{temperature}} on {{the length}} of incubation of <b>Chamaeleo</b> <b>chamaeleon</b> Carmen Díaz-Paniagua Abstract. Common chameleon eggs spend the first months of incubation at low temperatures. I incubated eggs of different clutches at 25 ◦C in four treatments with respectively 0, 84, 119 and 149 days of initial cold period (at 14 ◦C). Treatments with longer cold periods had longer total incubation but shorter periods of incubation at 25 ◦C. Eggs which did not experience initial cold period showed low synchronization at hatching. Hatchling body mass and length were influenced by the length of the cold period. Hatchlings were largest and heaviest for cold periods of intermediate length which had similar duration than the cold period experienced by eggs in nature. These results suggest that the cold torpor period of Common chameleon embryos contributes to optimization of development and growth, and synchronizes hatching...|$|R

Females laid a single clutch of 4 - 40 eggs, with a mean relative clutch mass of 60 - 70 %. Clutch size was correlated with maternal size, being larger in the wet year, whereas egg variables were independent of maternal characteristics.

In this area, the chameleon (<b>Chamaeleo</b> <b>chamaeleon)</b> is considered as an endangered species that usually inhabits in highly populated areas. Previous studies have shown high em- bryo mortality rates under natural incubation conditions. Lead and PCBs could be contributing to this low hatching success.

40|$|Chamaeleo pumilus {{is often}} {{classified}} {{in a separate}} genus Microsaura or Lophosaura, partly because of differences in lung-structure as compared with {{a small number of}} other species. The validity of this assumption, that is questioned, is investigated by studying the lungs of 17 species. Apart from the two lung-types of <b>Chamaeleo</b> <b>chamaeleon</b> and <b>Chamaeleo</b> pumilus already known, many other clearly distinguishable lungtypes were found. As similarities in lung-structure tend to coincide with the relationships distinguished by taxonomists, the lungs proved to be a useful character in this yet systematically difficult group. The extensive variation is discussed in view of various processes in action during the evolution of lungs. Thus it became possible to reconstruct two evolutionary lines, viz. a continental and a Malagasy one, within the genus Chamaeleo. The lung-types of the two species mentioned above represent respectively a primitive type in the one and an advanced type in the other line. Therefore the classification of Chamaeleo pumilus in a separate genus is not justified by the lung-anatomy...|$|R
40|$|We present IRAC (3. 6, 4. 5, 5. 8, and 8. 0 µm) {{observations}} of the <b>Chamaeleon</b> <b>II</b> molecular cloud. The observed area covers about 1 square degree defined by AV> 2. Analysis of the data in the 2005 c 2 d catalogs reveals {{a small number of}} sources (40) with properties similar to those of young stellar or substellar objects (YSOs). The surface density of these YSO candidates is low, and contamination by background galaxies appears to be substantial, especially for sources classified as Class I or flat SED. We discuss this problem in some detail and conclude that very few of the candidate YSOs in early evolutionary stages are actually in the Cha II cloud.

40|$|Keck {{mid-infrared}} imaging of circumstellar debris disks {{around the}} pre-main sequence stars, β Pictoris, HR. 4796 A and 49 Cet are presented. It is demonstrated that high resolution thermal imaging at mid-infrared wavelengths {{is the preferred}} method to resolve the inner regions of circumstellar disks, because of little contamination by the photosphere in this frequency regime. Our maps of the dust morphology reveal features like sharp ring confinement, asymmetric disk brightness, {{and in the case}} of β Pictoris, a multitude of rings with different orbital inclinations. These features join others found in a small but growing number of debris disk discoveries by direct imaging. Taken together, these present a mounting evidence of planetary signatures around pre-main sequence stars.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} controversy concerning {{the origin of}} Iberian populations of the Mediterranean chameleon, <b>Chamaeleo</b> <b>chamaeleon.</b> Current opinion dictates that Spanish populations result from introductions during the 18 th and 19 th centuries, with subsequent translocations from the original populations {{to other parts of}} Spain. The Portugese population in the Algarve {{is believed to have been}} introduced from Africa or Spain during the 1920 s. However, Holocene remains of chameleons suggest that the Malaga population at least could have a much older origin. Analysis of sequences from the mitochondrial 16 S ribosomal RNA gene of samples from the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa revealed a double origin for the Iberian population. The Mediterranean Iberian (Malaga) population is closely related to Mediterranean North African populations, with Atlantic Iberian populations more closely related to populations of the Atlantic coast of North Africa. The overall genetic differentiation and diversity observed was very low, preventing precise dating of the colonization events. However this low level of differentiation is not consistent with Plio-Pleistocene colonization, the assumed timing for a natural colonization event and suggests that chameleons were probably introduced twice by man in the recent past...|$|R
40|$|We {{define a}} sample {{designed}} to select low-mass T Tauri stars and young brown dwarfs using DENIS {{data in the}} <b>Chamaeleon</b> <b>II</b> molecular cloud. We use a star count method to construct an extinction map of the <b>Chamaeleon</b> <b>II</b> cloud. We select our low-mass T Tauri star and young brown dwarf candidates by their strong infrared colour excess in the I-J/J-K_s colour-colour dereddened diagram. We retain only objects with colours I-J> 2, and spatially distributed in groups around the cloud cores. This provides a sample of 70 stars of which 4 are previously known T Tauri stars. We have carefully checked the reliability of all these objects by visual inspection on the DENIS images. Thanks to the association of the optical I-band to the infra-red J and K_s bands in DENIS, we can apply this selection method to all star formation regions observed in the southern hemisphere. We also identify six DENIS sources with X-ray sources detected by ROSAT. Assuming that they are reliable low-mass candidates and using the evolutionary models for low-mass stars, we estimate the age of these sources between 1 Myr and < 10 Myr.

40|$|The Levant is an {{important}} migration bridge, harboring border-zones between Afrotropical and palearctic species. Accordingly, Chameleo chameleon, a common species throughout the Mediterranean basin, is morphologically divided in the southern Levant (Israel) into two subspecies, <b>Chamaeleo</b> <b>chamaeleon</b> recticrista (CCR) and C. c. musae (CCM). CCR mostly inhabits the Mediterranean climate (northern Israel), while CCM inhabits the sands of the north-western Negev Desert (southern Israel). AFLP analysis of 94 geographically well dispersed specimens indicated moderate genetic differentiation (PhiPT = 0. 097), consistent with the classical division into the two subspecies, CCR and CCM. In contrast, sequence analysis of a 637 bp coding mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragment revealed two distinct phylogenetic clusters which were {{not consistent with the}} morphological division: one mtDNA cluster consisted of CCR specimens collected in regions northern of the Jezreel Valley and another mtDNA cluster harboring specimens pertaining to both the CCR and CCM subspecies but collected southern of the Jezreel Valley. AMOVA indicated clear mtDNA differentiation between specimens collected northern and southern to the Jezreel Valley (PhiPT = 0. 79), which was further supported by a very low coalescent-based estimate of effective migration rates. Whole chameleon mtDNA sequencing (, 17, 400 bp) generated from 11 well dispersed geographic locations revealed 325 mutations sharply differentiating the two mtDNA clusters, suggesting a long allopatric history further supported by BEAST.
