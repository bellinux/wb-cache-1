25|$|In {{the trial}} de novo, the crown called six witnesses, {{including}} the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Constables {{and the wife}} of the hotel manager who had found Drybones. The crown also produced Joe Sangris as one of their witnesses, a former chief and leader of the Indian village at Yellowknife for 16 years. Mr. Sangris testified that he had known Drybones from his birth, as well as his wife and his father. Mr. Sangris also testified that Drybones received treaty money once a year. Another <b>crown</b> <b>witness</b> included David George Greyeyes, once the regional director of Indian affairs. Mr. Greyeyes was the officer charged with the maintenance of Indian records, contractual obligations and the execution of federal treaties involving Indians. Mr. Greyeyes produced official records of a Mr. Drybones, married to Madeline Crapeau with no children. Both Mr. Greyeyes and Mr. Sangris also testified that there were no Indian reserves in the Northwest Territories.|$|E
500|$|At the Old Bailey {{one of the}} {{principal}} crown witnesses was firearms expert Robert Churchill, who testified that the trigger of Mrs Barney's gun had a strong pull. When Hastings rose to cross-examine, he took up the gun, pointed it to the ceiling and repeatedly pulled the trigger over and over again. One <b>crown</b> <b>witness</b> had said that on another occasion she saw Elvira Barney firing the gun while holding it in her left hand; when he called his client Hastings had the gun placed in front of her. After a pause he shouted at her to pick up the gun and she spontaneously picked it up in her right hand. The Judge (Mr Justice Humphreys) described Hastings' final address as [...] "certainly one of the finest speeches I have ever heard at the Bar" [...] and Elvira Barney was found not guilty both of murder and manslaughter.|$|E
2500|$|Daljit Sandhu {{was later}} named by a <b>Crown</b> <b>witness</b> {{as the man}} who picked up the tickets. During the trial, the Crown played a video from January 1989 in which Sandhu congratulated the {{families}} of Indira Gandhi's assassins and stated that [...] "she deserved that and she invited that and that's why she got it". Sandhu was cleared by Judge Ian Josephson in a 16 March judgment.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{prosecution}} witness, RCMP Supt. Bruce Stuart, testified that: [...] "C8 carbines {{were eventually}} {{approved by the}} RCMP senior executive committee in September 2011, more than {{two and a half}} years before the Moncton shootings... would have proceeded with a national rollout..." [...] instead of the haphazard and partial one that followed one year later. [...] The final <b>Crown</b> <b>witness</b> was MacNeil, who lamented that nobody took command during the rampage, so officers were forced to make their own decisions amid the chaos. MacNeil said few front-line supervisors were trained to take control of such situations at the time, that no officers had put on body armour, and that at the time of the incident, Mounties in Moncton had only been trained with pistols.|$|E
2500|$|Hal Colebatch {{was born}} in Wolferlow in Herefordshire, England, on 29 March 1872. [...] His family {{migrated}} to Australia in 1878, settling at Goolwa in South Australia. [...] Colebatch left school in 1883 {{at the age of}} 11, because his father could not afford to continue his education. [...] He then found work as an office boy and junior reporter for a local newspaper, the Norwood Free Press. [...] When this paper collapsed, he worked for a series of short-lived papers on the South Australian goldfields. He worked for the Petersburg Times and the Laura Standard. In 1888, he moved to Broken Hill, New South Wales, where he worked for six years as reporter for the Silver Age. [...] There, he reported on a number of strike meetings in 1892, and was subsequently summoned as a <b>Crown</b> <b>witness</b> in the prosecution of some strike leaders.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Allewinde {{is a most}} erudite lawyer. He {{has been}} for many years {{employed}} by the crown in its prosecutions, and with great success. He knows well the art of luring on an approver, or <b>crown</b> <b>witness,</b> to give the information he wants without asking absolutely leading questions; he knows well how to bully a witness brought up on the defence out of his senses, and make him give evidence rather against than for the prisoner; {{and it is not}} only witnesses that he bullies, but his very brethren of the gown. The barristers themselves who are opposed to him, at any rate, the juniors, are doomed to bear the withering force of his caustic remarks.|$|E
5000|$|The retrial {{began in}} October 1970. It became {{apparent}} during proceedings that <b>crown</b> <b>witnesses</b> had been confronted outside of court. As a result, Justice McGonigal warned {{the court that}} any threats made to any witnesses would [...] "be met with the most severe punishment which the court could impose".|$|R
50|$|Legebokoff's {{trial on}} four {{counts of murder}} was {{originally}} scheduled to begin in September 2013, but was delayed a month until October and then again until June 2014.

25|$|In {{criminal}} cases, the Court of Appeal {{has allowed}} appeals and quashed convictions {{on the basis}} of misconduct by <b>Crown</b> <b>witnesses</b> analogous to fraud, e.g.: where prosecution witnesses had subsequently been convicted for giving perjured evidence during the original trial; or, where police officers who took confessions from the appellants had subsequently been discredited in later proceedings.|$|R
6000|$|As {{we shall}} see, {{he was at}} first and he long {{remained}} untouched {{by the idea of}} Italian unity and Italy a nation. He met some thirty or more Italian gentlemen in society at Naples, of whom seven or eight only were in any sense liberals, and not one of them a republican. It was now that he made the acquaintance of Lacaita, afterwards so valued a friend of his, and so well known in many circles in England for his geniality, cultivation, and enlightenment. He was the legal adviser to the British embassy; he met Mr. Gladstone constantly; they talked politics and literature day and night, 'under the acacias and palms, between the fountains and statues of the Villa Reale, looking now to the sea, now to the world of fashion in the Corso.' Here Lacaita first opened the traveller's eyes to the condition of things, though he was able to say with literal truth that not a single statement of fact was made upon Lacaita's credit. Mr. Gladstone saw Bourbon absolutism no longer in the decorous hues of conventional diplomacy, but as the black and execrable thing it really was,--'the negation of God erected into a system of government.' Sitting in court for long hours during the trial of Poerio, he listened with as much patience as he could command to the principal <b>crown</b> <b>witness,</b> giving such evidence that the tenth part of what he heard should not only have ended the case, but secured condign punishment for perjury--evidence that a prostitute court found good enough to justify the infliction on Poerio, not long before a minister of the crown, of the dreadful penalty of four-and-twenty years in irons. Mr. Gladstone accurately informed himself of the condition of those who for unproved political offences were in thousands undergoing degrading and murderous penalties. He contrived to visit some of the Neapolitan prisons, another name for the extreme of filth and horror; he saw political prisoners (and political prisoners included {{a large percentage of the}} liberal opposition) chained two and two in double irons to common felons; he conversed with Poerio himself in the bagno of Nisida chained in this way; he watched sick prisoners, men almost with death in their faces, toiling upstairs to see the doctors, because the lower regions were too foul and loathsome to allow it to be expected that professional men would enter. Even these inhuman and revolting scenes stirred him less, as it was right they should, than the corruptions of the tribunals, the vindictive treatment for long periods of time of uncondemned and untried men, and all the other proceedings of the government, 'desolating entire classes upon which the life and growth of the nation depend, undermining the foundation of all civil rule.' It was this violation of all law, and of the constitution to which King Ferdinand had solemnly sworn fidelity only a year or two before, that outraged him more than even rigorous sentences and barbarous prison practice. 'Even on the severity of these sentences,' he wrote, 'I would not endeavour to fix attention so much as to draw it off from the great fact of illegality, which seems to me to be the foundation of the Neapolitan system; illegality, the fountain-head of cruelty and baseness and every other vice; illegality which gives a bad conscience, creates fears; those fears lead to tyranny, that tyranny begets resentment, that resentment creates true causes of fear where they were not before; and thus fear is quickened and enhanced, the original vice multiplies itself with fearful speed, and the old crime engenders a necessity for new.'[241] ...|$|E

50|$|A {{fortnight}} {{after the}} attack McLeod-Lindsay was charged with the attempted murder {{of his wife and}} son. Mrs McLeod-Lindsay gave evidence for the defence. The Crown case was that Pamela McLeod-Lindsay was lying to protect the family’s income. There were no signs of forced entry but the house was unlocked. <b>Crown</b> <b>witnesses</b> gave inconclusive evidence in relation to a man and a car seen in the area. A witness for the defence gave evidence that he was talking to the accused man at the hotel {{at the time of the}} assault.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, it {{was held}} that where a court has, on {{improper}} grounds, refused to order particulars {{to be given to}} an accused in a case where such particulars ought to have been given, the prejudice to the accused is not necessarily cured by postponing the hearing {{at the conclusion of the}} Crown case so as to enable the accused to prepare his defense, because the accused will probably have been prejudiced in his cross-examination of the <b>Crown</b> <b>witnesses</b> if he was not fully acquainted with the case he had to meet.|$|R
50|$|Louise Reynolds was a 28-year-old {{single mother}} living in Kingston, Ontario, charged with second degree murder for having killed her seven-year-old {{daughter}} Sharon in 1997 by stabbing {{her more than}} 80 times {{with a pair of}} scissors. Much of the case rested on Dr. Smith’s 10-page autopsy report. In January 2001 the Crown abruptly dropped the charges, after numerous experts, including <b>Crown</b> <b>witnesses,</b> disagreed with Smith and agreed that a powerful dog had mauled the girl (there was a pit-bull present in the house at the time). By then, Reynolds had spent 22 months in custody.|$|R

50|$|Defence counsel, Greg King, {{questioned}} {{forensic expert}} David Neale {{about the size}} of the footprints found at the scene. Neale told the Court there were more than 50 footprints next to Guy's body, and they were all made by size 9 Proline boots. King said the 33 wavy rows on the plaster impressions of the boots presented by the police were not compatible with size 9. King also challenged prosecution evidence about the shotgun. <b>Crown</b> <b>witnesses</b> told the Court they heard three shots in succession but King called an American shooting champion as an expert witness. This witness said it was not possible for the farm shotgun to be fired that quickly and suggested a semi-automatic weapon had been used.|$|R

Although this was never proven Sir Oliver Goonetilleke resigned and went into self-imposed exile in Britain.
