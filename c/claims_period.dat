50|$|Because {{many of the}} 44 Mega Millions {{participants}} have a one-year <b>claim</b> <b>period,</b> the California legislature changed the language in the Lottery Act. On April 23, 2008, Gov.

40|$|Abstract. High-resolution {{spectroscopy}} and photometric {{monitoring of}} the pre-main sequence star RX J 1608. 6 - 3922 shows {{that it is not}} an eclipsing binary, as previously claimed. Radial velocity measurements covering suitable time spans in order to detect a spectroscopic binary with the <b>claimed</b> <b>period</b> of about 7 days have been performed. The scatter of the radial velocity does not exceed 2. 4 kms− 1, defining an upper mass limit of 24 MJupiter for any eclipsing companion orbiting this star with the <b>claimed</b> <b>period.</b> Photometric observations of RX J 1608. 6 - 3922 in 7 consecutive nights (i. e. as long as the <b>claimed</b> orbital <b>period)</b> reveal brightness variations of the order of 0. 2 mag with a period of 3. 6 days. The shape of the detected light curve differs from a light curve of the star recorded in 1996. The small variations of the radial velocity, the variable shape of the light curve, as well as (B − V) color variations suggest that the flux of RX J 1608. 6 - 3922 is modulated by spots on the stellar surface with a rotational period of 3. 6 days. The stellar activity of this star seems to be highly variable, taking into account the variable shape of the light curve, with an amplitude varying from 0. 5 to 0. 2 mag in a few years, as well as hints for a variable Hα equivalent width...|$|R

50|$|Income Protection in Australia is {{designed}} to provide replacement of income to individuals who are unable to work due to illness or injury. Income Protection in Australia will generally replace up to 75% of a person's gross income. The majority of policies offered in Australia will provide benefits if a person is unable to conduct their own occupation, even when a policy is held within superannuation. There are however some high risk occupations where, if policies are available, they are offered on an 'any occupation' basis, either immediately on claim, or after an 'own occupation' <b>claim</b> <b>period.</b> Income Protection is available to employees and the self-employed, with greater importance held on the latter as the self-employed are generally not eligible for Workers' Compensation.|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{administrative}} individual spell {{data from}} the UK (JUVOS) to analyse the determinants of unemployment duration. JUVOS is considered as an important data set {{for the analysis of}} UK unemployment as it contains daily information about <b>claim</b> <b>periods</b> for unemployment compensation from the 1980 s until the summer of 2007. However, data limitations include the unavailability of other administrative data sources within JUVOS which results in partial identification of unemployment periods. Another constraint consists in the uncertainty of the labour market state before and after unemployment. This research takes these data limitations into account. The econometric analysis suggests that several empirical result patterns are not robust with respect to competing data preparation steps. A more precise analysis of the determinants of unemployment duration would require the availability of merged administrative data...|$|R

40|$|Employing a large individual-level {{administrative}} dataset from Great Britain, {{covering the}} period 1999 - 2005, we analyse the factors influencing {{the length of}} unemployment benefits claimant periods with subsequent transition to re-employment. To this end, this individual-level data is merged {{with a group of}} regional indicators to control for relevant regional labour market characteristics. From a methodological point of view, we adopt a flexible censored quantile regression approach to estimating conditional re-employment hazards. Our results indicate that the individual characteristics of an unemployed person are generally more im-portant than the regional labour market conditions. However, regional labour supply and demand conditions are important determinants for the length of unemployment compensa-tion <b>claim</b> <b>periods.</b> Our analysis provides evidence that large cities such as London and Birmingham provide the worse local labour market conditions for job seekers allowance re-cipients, while remote regions like the Shetland islands perform among the best...|$|R

40|$|Canine rabies can be {{effectively}} controlled by vaccination with readily available, high-quality vaccines. These vaccines should provide protection from challenge in healthy dogs, for the <b>claimed</b> <b>period,</b> for duration of immunity, {{which is often}} two or three years. It has been suggested that, in free-roaming dog populations where rabies is endemic, vaccine-induced protection may be compromised by immuno-suppression through malnutrition, infection and other stressors. This may reduce the proportion of dogs that seroconvert to the vaccine during vaccination campaigns and the duration of immunity of those dogs that seroconvert. Vaccination coverage may also be limited through insufficient vaccine delivery during vaccination campaigns {{and the loss of}} vaccinated individuals from populations through demographic processes. This is the first longitudinal study to evaluate temporal variations in rabies vaccine-induced serological responses, and factors associated with these variations, at the individual level in previously unvaccinated free-roaming dog populations. Individual-level serological and health-based data were collected from three cohorts of dogs in regions where rabies is endemic, one in South Africa and two in Indonesia. We found {{that the vast majority of}} dogs seroconverted to the vaccine; however, ther...|$|R
40|$|Van Dam et al. (2006) claimed 2. 4 to 2. 5 and 1. 0 Myr {{turnover}} cycles in a Spanish rodent lineages record. However, {{the record}} variance spectrum, which {{is missing in}} ibid., shows that the varying reliability and multiple alterations of raw (gapped and unaltered) data by ibid. unnaturally boosted the 2. 5 and 1. 0 Myr noise cycles to the 99 % confidence level, while failing to recognize a third such so called 99 % significant noise period, of 0. 55 Myr at 5. 3 var%. Thus at least one <b>claimed</b> <b>period</b> (of 1. 0 Myr) is a simple modulation of a relatively stronger noise cycle (of 0. 55 Myr) overlooked by ibid. All so called 99 % significant periods reach mere 5 to 6 % var levels which can be hardly distinguished from noise: those periods fidelity is at staggering 1 to 2 orders of magnitude below the usual signal to noise separation marker at 12. 0. Remarkably, at least ten noise periods got boosted to 95 % confidence level, and some five noise periods to near 95 % confidence level, as well. Even the zero padding of just 4 % of data, as done by ibid., significantly suppresses (hence unreported) the strongest 99 % significant period, of 7. 28 Myr at 7. 5 var%. Therefore, the <b>periods</b> <b>claimed</b> are due to strong noise reflection of some intermediary. As hand waving cyclic cataclysm claims start to frequent scientific journals, revision of editorial policies is called for on spectral analyses of inherently gapped long records, and of records composed mostly of natural data of significantly inconsistent reliability.
