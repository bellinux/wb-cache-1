500|$|The Dream's {{exterior}} uses a soft, matte plastic shell, and {{was made}} available in white, black, and bronze colors. The Dream's design features a distinctive [...] "chin" [...] on the bottom, which houses 5 navigation buttons ("Call", [...] "Home", [...] "Menu", [...] "Back", and [...] "End Call") and a clickable trackball {{in the center}} {{which can be used}} for scrolling and selecting. The device uses a [...] <b>capacitive</b> <b>touchscreen</b> LCD at a resolution of 320×480; the screen can be slid along a curved hinge to expose a five-row QWERTY keyboard—as the first releases of Android did not include a virtual keyboard, the keyboard was originally the only method of text input on the device. While supporting multitouch at the hardware level, the Linux kernel in the Dream's Android distribution was patched to remove multitouch support from its touchscreen drivers for undisclosed reasons. The Dream does not include a traditional headphone jack, requiring an adapter for HTC's proprietary (but Mini-USB compatible) [...] "ExtUSB" [...] port located {{on the bottom of the}} device. The rear of the device houses a 3.15-megapixel rear camera with auto-focus.|$|E

2500|$|The {{display of}} the iPhone 4 is {{manufactured}} by LG under an exclusive contract with Apple. It features an LED backlit TFT LCD <b>capacitive</b> <b>touchscreen</b> with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch (ppi) on a [...] (diagonally measured), 960×640 display. Each pixel is 78 micrometers in width. The display has a contrast ratio of 800:1. The screen is marketed by Apple as the [...] "Retina display", based on the assertion that a display of approximately 300 ppi {{at a distance of}} [...] from one's eye, or 57 arcseconds per pixel is the maximum amount of detail that the human retina can perceive. With the iPhone expected to be used at a distance of about 12inches from the eyes, a higher resolution would allegedly have no effect on the image's apparent quality as the maximum potential of the human eye has already been met.|$|E

50|$|The stylus is {{the primary}} input device for {{personal}} digital assistants and smartphones that require accurate input, although devices featuring multi-touch finger-input with <b>capacitive</b> <b>touchscreens</b> are becoming more popular than stylus-driven devices in the smartphone market.|$|R
50|$|<b>Capacitive</b> <b>touchscreens</b> {{are more}} {{responsive}} than resistive touchscreens (which react to any object since no capacitance is needed), but less accurate.

50|$|Several {{technologies}} {{can be used}} {{to detect}} touch. Resistive and <b>capacitive</b> <b>touchscreens</b> have conductive materials embedded in the glass and detect the position of the touch by measuring changes in electric current. Infrared controllers project a grid of infrared beams inserted into the frame surrounding the monitor screen itself, and detect where an object intercepts the beams.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Capacitive</b> <b>touchscreens</b> {{tend to be}} less accurate, {{but more}} {{responsive}} than resistive devices. Because they require a conductive material, such as a finger tip, for input, they are not common among stylus-oriented devices, but are prominent on consumer devices. Most finger-driven capacitive screens do not currently support pressure input (except for the iPhone 6S and later models), but some tablets use a pressure-sensitive stylus or active pen.|$|R

To address this challenge, this work explores a novel form of “wireless ” communication that exploits the <b>capacitive</b> <b>touchscreens</b> which are now used in laptops, phones, and tablets, as a signal receiver. Using a custom built hardware token, {{in the form of}} a wearable ring, we show a proof-of-concept system that transmits a user identification code to the mobile device through the touchscreen. This mechanism works without any modification to the hardware or the firmware of the mobile device...|$|R
50|$|An {{infrared}} touchscreen uses {{an array}} of X-Y infrared LED and photodetector pairs {{around the edges of}} the screen to detect a disruption in the pattern of LED beams. These LED beams cross each other in vertical and horizontal patterns. This helps the sensors pick up the exact location of the touch. A major benefit of such a system is that it can detect essentially any input including a finger, gloved finger, stylus or pen. It is generally used in outdoor applications and point of sale systems which can not rely on a conductor (such as a bare finger) to activate the <b>touchscreen.</b> Unlike <b>capacitive</b> <b>touchscreens,</b> infrared touchscreens do not require any patterning on the glass which increases durability and optical clarity of the overall system. Infrared touchscreens are sensitive to dirt/dust that can interfere with the IR beams, and suffer from parallax in curved surfaces and accidental press when the user hovers his/her finger over the screen while searching for the item to be selected.|$|R
