Mallory Clarkson of the London Community News {{reported}} that, while She Has a Name is an emotional play, there are lighter moments where audience members <b>can</b> <b>laugh.</b> Similarly, Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate asserted that the play's sporadic humorous points maintain the audience's engagement with the story so they do not become numb to the play's emotional pulls. Kooman stated {{that he tried to}} write the play {{in a way that would}} shock audiences without disturbing them to the point that they would not recommend it to friends.|$|E
500|$|Although Lady Penelope and Parker (the latter {{voiced by}} Graham) {{were among the}} first {{characters}} developed, neither was conceived as a major role. Parker's Cockney manner was based on a waiter at a pub in Cookham that was sometimes visited by the crew. On Gerry Anderson's recommendation, Graham dined there regularly to study the accent. Anderson's first choice for the role of Penelope had been Fenella Fielding, but Sylvia insisted she take the part herself. Her Penelope voice was intended to emulate Fielding and Joan Greenwood. On Penelope and Parker's secondary role as comic relief, Gerry explained, [...] "We British <b>can</b> <b>laugh</b> at ourselves, so therefore we had Penelope and Parker as this comedy team. And in America they love the British aristocracy too.'" ...|$|E

[...] Nancy Basile of About.com ranked the episode at number two for her list of the Top 10 SpongeBob SquarePants Episodes. She said [...] "'Sailor Mouth' just barely missed being in the number one slot." [...] Basile praised the episode's plot and called it [...] "genius because children can relate to the forbidden thrill of using curse words, and adults <b>can</b> <b>laugh</b> at the parody of TV censorship."

500|$|Sanz {{is known}} for his {{distinctive}} raspy vocals, which he attributes to his flamenco roots, crediting singer Camarón de la Isla as a major influence. His song [...] "Sí, He Cantado Mal" [...] (Yes, I Have Sung Badly) from No Es lo Mismo references this, with Sanz saying [...] "I'm laughing a little at myself so that I <b>can</b> <b>laugh</b> at other things. Sometimes, I'm harder on myself than any music critic can be. I'm laughing at that." [...] Throughout his youth, Sanz was heavily influenced by English-language heavy metal groups such as Iron Maiden and Dio, referring to himself as a [...] "heavy metal radical". He also feels that living in the city of Cadiz had a major impact on his musical style, where [...] "Any 7-year-old kid you find knows how to play guitar, play the cajón, knows how to sing.

On November 18, 2004, she revealed on her website that {{the name of the}} album would be The Emancipation of Mimi. While Carey was recording the album, Island Records executive L.A. Reid had learned that close friends referred to the singer as [...] "Mimi". He had told Carey, [...] "I feel your spirit on this record. You should use that name in the title, because that's the fun side of you that people don't get to see – the side that <b>can</b> <b>laugh</b> at the diva jokes, laugh at the breakdown jokes, laugh at whatever they want to say about you and just live life and enjoy it." [...] Carey explained that Mimi is a [...] "very personal nickname" [...] only used by those in her inner circle, and thus the title meant she was letting her guard down and inviting her fans to be that much closer to her. She thought that naming her album The Emancipation of Mariah Carey would be [...] "obnoxious".|$|E

The {{interference}} upset club captain Tony Adams, who on {{his first meeting with}} the manager expressed his disappointment: [...] "I said to him that he had put our entire season in jeopardy by doing what he had done." [...] Wenger chose to take the criticism on board upon arrival, and made an effort listening to Adams' assessment of the club. This particular approach of management resonated with the other players, who were sceptical of his ideas at first. The English players often set up pranks on Wenger to relieve hostility and nicknamed him [...] "Inspector Clouseau", due to his clumsy nature. Adams said his sense of humour helped build team spirit: [...] "Not only does Wenger love a good laugh, but he <b>can</b> <b>laugh</b> at himself. He is this gangly wise man".|$|E

2500|$|With {{about two}} {{minutes left in the}} half, the Dolphins finally managed to get a good drive going on their next possession. Marino {{completed}} seven out of nine passes, the last one being a 30-yard pass to tight end Joe Rose, to reach the 49ers' 12-yard line. However, San Francisco's defense tightened up on the next three plays, forcing two incompletions and a completed pass for no gain, and Miami was forced to settle for von Schamann's second field goal of the game to cut their deficit to 28–13 with 12 seconds left in the half. Then Miami caught a break as the 49ers botched the ensuing kickoff. San Francisco lineman Guy McIntyre received von Schamann's short kick and was about to down the ball, but then changed his mind at the last second and decided to return it. This {{turned out to be a}} big mistake; McIntyre fumbled while being leveled by rookie Joe Carter, and Jim Jensen recovered the ball for Miami at the 49ers' 12-yard line. After that, von Schamann kicked his third field goal on the last play of the half, cutting the score to 28–16. [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>laugh</b> about the play now, but it wasn't funny at the time," [...] McIntyre said after the game. [...] "My first instinct when I got the ball was to fall down.
