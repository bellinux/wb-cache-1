50|$|Optimum cutting {{efficiencies}} often generate long spring-like swarf. This {{is hard to}} {{deal with}} as it is bulky and can clog the nozzle of a shop vac. Clean-up and disposal of this continuous-cutting swarf is made simpler by using a cutting tool with a <b>chip-breaker.</b> This results in denser, more manageable waste.Chip breaking tool geometry is generally designed to break the chip by having it curl back onto itself. This action produces many small spiral shaped rings instead of one long helical chip.|$|E

In this paper, {{four types}} P turning insert groove with 3 D <b>chip-breaker</b> are {{investigated}} for {{the influence of}} cutting force, cutting temperature and chip deformation. The experimental result shows that cutting force and total cutting heat corresponding different insert type {{are not the same}} between each other. These experiments also show that the arrangement sequence of chips deformation is consistent with that of cutting temperature for four kind of turning insert. The greater chip deformation indicates more work done, thus the more cutting heat taken away...|$|E

A 14. 5 MPa jet of cuttingfluid was applied against the chip$ow at the rake face of the tool and this works as an efficient <b>chip-breaker.</b> Conventional overheadflood cooling was also used to establish a base for comparison.

40|$|AbstractDuring drilling, long stringy chips {{resulting}} from ductile plastic deformation of engineering materials cause severe chip clogging within the narrow helical flutes and edge chipping, leading to premature tool wear and breakage, poor tool life, poor hole {{quality and the}} productivity. Cutting fluid cannot efficiently access to the cutting edge that plays a vital role for improving machining performance. To address the localized heat and chip control issues during drilling, research was previously performed using conventional flood cooling, modified tool geometry, tool coating materials, and internal coolant via through hole(s). This works focuses on design and insertion of some obstruction-type chip breakers such as ribs and pins on the drill flutes and their influence on chip formation behavior. For feasibility experiments, small round pins made of stainless steel at a diameter of about 0. 8 - 0. 85 mm diameter are prepared and attached on the electro-discharge machined (EDM) blind holes on twisted drill flutes. By varying spindle speed and feed rate, drilling experiments are performed on two engineering materials including Al 6061 and Inconel 625 superalloys at four cutting conditions. Most chips {{are found to be}} broken and some split into two fractions due to the pins. Force and power values with pin-inserted drill bits were found to be reduced from 5 - 9 %. This finding indicates that there is a good potential to implement such obstruction-type <b>chip-breakers</b> on the drill flutes for obtaining controllable chip while also improving coolant flow at the cutting edge through the tiny tool-chip interface...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the activities of}} the research project entitled {open_quotes}Study of Chip Breaking Mechanisms in Orthogonal Cutting{close_quotes}. The research effort took place from April 1990 to June 1991. The overall objective of the project was to develop a systematic procedure for gaining a more fundamental understanding of chip breaking mechanics. Central to this objective is a computer model that can simulate chip formation in orthogonal cutting. This model has been under development {{for the past seven years}} at NCSU. The model is based on an Eulerian formulation of the finite element technique. The model simulates the cutting process for various tool geometries over a wide range of cutting conditions. The model can be used to predict chip geometry, cutting forces, plastic strains, strain rates, and temperatures in the workpiece and chip, as well as temperatures in the tool itself. Of particular significance is that specific tool geometries can be simulated. Therefore, the model can be used to systematically evaluate the strains, strain rates, temperature, and geometry of the chip as a function of a specific <b>chip-breaker</b> tool design. These results can provide the crucial information necessary to formulate a fundamental understanding of the chip breaking mechanism over a wide range of operating conditions and workpiece materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to clarify {{the effects of the}} {{inclination}} angle (i(k)) of the knife, the distance (ℓ(k)) on the knife rake-face from the knife edge to the <b>chip-breaker</b> edge, and the grain angle (φ) of the workpiece upon the variations of the components and the resultant of the cutting force in the oblique cutting of wood parallel to the grain with the knife equipped with a chip breaker. Air-dried specimens of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were used in this study, and were cut by feeding a knife equipped with a chip breaker, which was set on the same experimental apparatus equipped with a three-dimensional elastic-ring dynamometer as used in the previous reports 4) ～ 6). The lateral (FX), main (FY), and thrust (FZ) components of the cutting force acting on the knife equipped with the fhip breaker were measured. Using the measured components mensioned above, the resultant (R) was calculated. Based on these results, effects of the cutting conditions (i(k) and ℓ(k)) and the workpiece condition (φ) upon the variations of the components and the resultant of the cutting force were clarified (Figs. 15 ～ 22). Characteristics of the oblique wood-cutting with a chip breaker are discussed, comparing its cutting with the oblique wood-cutting without a chip breaker and the orthogonal wood-cutting...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{starting}} {{materials for the}} metal foam production process The aim of current investigations of the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU focuses {{at one of the}} most critical points about metal foam: The price! Alternative {{starting materials}} for the metal foam production have been investigated during a publicly funded project in close cooperation with industrial partners. A technology for the substitution of the starting powders has been developed allowing a cost effective production on an industrial scale. Metal chips for instance from milling and turning production processes have been fractured down to a grain size suitable for the substitution of metal powder in the powder metallurgical route of metal foam production. In addition to the large impact onto the resource material reduction and directly connected the energy savings, the use of recycling materials will open a new horizon for the application of metal foams caused by the new price structure. The technical requirements for the fracturing process of metal chips have been realized in a specially designed and built prototype device called <b>Chip-Breaker.</b> Its functionality has been proven in several tests. Another way for cost reduction is the substitution of the currently used very expensive blowing agent (TiH 2). As the decomposition of the new blowing (CaCO 3) agent releases carbon-dioxide instead of hydrogen the danger of explosion has been reduced to a minimum. As usual the material mixture of metal and blowing agent has been compacted by extrusion pressing, portioned in a mold and heat treated for the final foaming step. The results show differences in foaming structure but no significant loss in foamability. The combination of both substitutes aluminum chips and alternative blowing agent can reduce the costs of the metal foam to a third of the current stage. That way, new application markets such as architecture, ship building and art work show major interest leading metal foam to a new industrial stage...|$|E
