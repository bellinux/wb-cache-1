5|$|The {{common cold}} {{is the most}} common human disease and affects people all over the globe. Adults {{typically}} have two to five infections annually, and children may have six to ten <b>colds</b> a year (and up to twelve <b>colds</b> a year for school children). Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity.|$|E

In this paper, taking Sanhejian Coal Mine as an example, we analyze the effect of <b>cold</b> energy storage in doublet-wells by analyzing the volume change of <b>cold</b> water body within different temperature ranges in different periods. Through the analysis of volume change of <b>cold</b> water body, it can prove as time goes, the proportion of 2 - 5 °C <b>cold</b> water body is decreasing, the proportion of 5 - 10 °C <b>cold</b> water body and 10 - 15 °C <b>cold</b> water body are maintained at 14 % and 28 %.

40|$|Abstract: Nowdays, {{occupational}} and recreational activities in <b>cold</b> environments are common. Exposure to <b>cold</b> induces thermoregulatory responses like changes of behaviour and physiological adjustments to maintain thermal balance either by increasing metabolic heat production by shivering and/or by decreasing heat losses consecutive to peripheral cutaneous vasoconstriction. Those physiological responses present a great variability among individuals and depend mainly on biometrical characteristics, age, and general <b>cold</b> adaptation. During severe <b>cold</b> exposure, medical disorders may occur such as accidental hypothermia and/or freezing or non-freezing <b>cold</b> injuries. General <b>cold</b> adaptations have been qualitatively classified by Hammel and quantitatively by Savourey. This last classification {{takes into account}} the quantitative changes of the main <b>cold</b> reactions: higher or lower metabolic heat production, higher or lesser heat losses and finally the level of the core temperature observed {{at the end of a}} standardized exposure to <b>cold.</b> General <b>cold</b> adaptations observed previously in natives could also be developed in laboratory conditions by continuous or intermittent <b>cold</b> exposures. Beside general <b>cold</b> adaptation, local <b>cold</b> adaptation exists and is characterized by a lesser decrease of skin temperature, a more pronounced <b>cold</b> induced vasodilation, less pain and a higher manual dexterity. Adaptations to <b>cold</b> may reduce the occurrence of accidents and improve human performance as surviving in the <b>cold.</b> The present review describes both general and local <b>cold</b> adaptations in humans and how they are of interest for <b>cold</b> workers...|$|R
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Common Cold Unit {{was set up}} by the Medical Research Council in 1946 and it {{was where}} the {{rhinovirus}} was discovered in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed.

5|$|The {{common cold}} is a viral {{infection}} of the upper respiratory tract. The most commonly implicated virus is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronavirus (≈15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total over 200 viral types are associated with <b>colds.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{at work on}} The Songlines between 1983 and 1986, Chatwin {{frequently}} {{came down}} with <b>colds.</b> He also developed skin lesions {{that may have been}} symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma. After finishing The Songlines in August 1986, Chatwin went to Switzerland, where he collapsed on the street. At a clinic there, he was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Chatwin provided different reasons to his doctors as to how he might have contracted HIV, including from a gang rape in Dahomey or possibly from Sam Wagstaff, the patron and lover of Robert Mapplethorpe.|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{exposure}} of homeothermic animals to low environmental temperatures elicits physiological adaptations necessary for animal survival, which are associated to higher generation of pro-oxidants in thermogenic tissues. It {{is not known}} whether intermittent <b>cold</b> exposure (<b>cold</b> training) is able to affect tissue responses to continuous <b>cold</b> exposure. Therefore, we investigated whether rat liver responses to continuous <b>cold</b> {{exposure of}} 2 days are modified by <b>cold</b> training (1 h daily for 5 days per week for 3 consecutive weeks). Continuous <b>cold</b> increased liver oxidative metabolism by increasing tissue content of mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial aerobic capacity. <b>Cold</b> training did not affect such parameters, but attenuated or prevented the changes elicited by continuous <b>cold</b> exposure. Two-day <b>cold</b> exposure increased lipid hydroperoxide and protein-bound carbonyl levels in homogenates and mitochondria, whereas <b>cold</b> training decreased such effects although it decreased only homogenate protein damage in control rats. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes GPX and GR and H 2 O 2 production were increased by continuous <b>cold</b> exposure. Despite the increase in GPX and GR activities, livers from cold-exposed rats showed increased susceptibility to in vitro oxidative challenge. Such <b>cold</b> effects were decreased by <b>cold</b> training, which in control rats reduced only H 2 O 2 production and susceptibility to stress. The changes of PGC- 1, NRF- 1, and NRF- 2 expression levels were consistent with those induced by <b>cold</b> exposure and <b>cold</b> training in mitochondrial protein content and antioxidant enzyme activities. However, the mechanisms by which <b>cold</b> training attenuates {{the effects of the}} continuous <b>cold</b> exposure remain to be elucidated...|$|R
