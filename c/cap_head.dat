40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} issues about the Tertiary–Quaternary alkaline magmatism spreading across the Euro-Mediterranean region is the assessment of both the nature of its mantle source and the mechanism responsible for the common HIMU-like (High μ = high 238 U/ 204 Pb) character of erupted lavas, enduring over about 100 million years in diverse tectonic environments. In this paper we try to reconcile geochemical and geophysical data through a multidisciplinary investigation on geochemistry, timing and locations of the main Na-rich alkaline volcanic centers, seismic tomographic images and plate kinematics. We propose that the common component of the Euro-Mediterranean mantle derives from a contamination episode triggered by the rise of the Central Atlantic Plume (<b>CAP)</b> <b>head.</b> Plate reconstruction shows that at late Cretaceous- Paleocene time the oldest magmatic centers of the Euro-Mediterranean region were located more than 2000 km SW of their present day position, in proximity of the CAP hot spot location, where seismic tomography detects a broad low seismic velocity region in the lower mantle. The north- eastward migration of the Eurasian and African plates could have involved also part of the CAP contaminated mantle, which moved in the same direction being coupled to the lithospheric plates, thus explaining the presence of geochemically-uniform material spread in the sub-lithospheric Euro-Mediterranean mantle. During the Tertiary, regional-scale convection and related processes such as rifting, back-arc spreading, slab detachment/windows, may have favored upwelling and partial melting of the frayed plume head material via adiabatic decompression, shaping the spatial and temporal distribution of HIMU-like volcanics. The growing supply of subducted lithosphere may explain as well the increase of crustal isotopic signatures of alkaline magmas with time. In our opinion, the Euro-Mediterranean upper mantle contamination can be eventually related to a global event occurred during the Cretaceous as a consequence of a mantle avalanche caused by the Tethys closure...|$|E
40|$|From late Cretaceous {{to present}} time, an {{extensive}} magmatic activity developed both in Europe and northern Africa, showing a progressive transition with time from calc-alkaline to Na-rich alkaline features in areas tightly connected with subduction systems (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Spain, Italy), while Na-rich basalts and basanites, with minor tholeiitic volcanics, occur at extensional tectonic settings, both associated {{or not to}} orogenic dynamics (Valencia trough, Pannonian, Alboran, Tyrrhenian, and Aegean basins, Pantelleria-Etna-Iblean area, Veneto Province, Cenozoic Rift System). The widespread alkaline magmatism in the European and circum Mediterranean area shows a uniform HIMU-DMM type signature which has been recently ascribed to a mantle contamination episode triggered {{by the rise of}} the Central Atlantic Plume (<b>CAP)</b> <b>head</b> since Cretaceous time (Piromallo et al., 2008). The occurrence of a HIMU-DMM component within lavas originated in collision environments such as the Veneto Volcanic Province in NE Alps (related to the Tertiary convergence of Europe and Africa plates) or the Roman Magmatic Province (related to the Cenozoic Adria subduction) might be explained in terms of slab breakoff (Macera et al., 2008; Gasperini et al., 2002). Evidence for slab breakoff in these areas comes from seismic tomography (Piromallo and Faccenna, 2004) and geophysical modeling consisting in evaluating the time evolution of buoyancy of oceanic and continental lithosphere during subduction with both constant and time-varying convergence rates (Macera et al., 2008). If the subducted slab intercepts a hot mantle diapir rising from the frayed plume head, the corresponding part of the slab is heated and therefore softened. The softening effect is enhanced if the slab includes continental material. The combination of changes in negative buoyancy caused by continental subduction, and softening of a part of the slab caused by slab-plume interaction, may act as a regulator for the time of slab breakoff and consequently for the time and type variations of magmatism in the overriding lithosphere above a subduction zone. In the Alpine region, we assume that the plume material interacted with the subducting slab causing its heating, softening, and finally its detachment. Ensuing upwelling of plume material through the resulting plate window {{is supposed to be the}} responsible for partial melting in the lithospheric mantle wedge and/or decompression melting of the ascending plume material. Plume-related volcanism in subduction zones is possible either before the subducted slab intercepts plume head material, or after slab breakoff. The above considerations provide a framework for the occurrence of plume-related and calc-alkaline magmatism in the southeastern Alps and probably in other similar tectonic settings such as the Central Europe Magmatic Province. The heat released by the hot mantle component to the overriding mantle wedge contributed to its partial melting and production of calc-alkaline mafic magmas. The latter additionally favored the genesis of calc-alkaline felsic magmas through partial melting of the lower crust by underplating. A quantitative approach based on mixing calculations on Sr-Nd and Pb isotopes support these hypotheses...|$|E
40|$|AIM: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} and compare the physiological, cognitive and cardiovascular responses during explosives ordnance disposal (EOD) type activity in moderate and hot environments whilst wearing an EOD suit and phase change material cooling garments on either the head or torso. METHODS: Following ethical approval from Coventry University’s Ethical Committee, and after providing informed consent, six healthy, unacclimatised males {{took part in the}} study (age: 23 (3) yrs; height: 1. 74 (0. 05) m; mass: 65. 1 (2. 0) kg). Each participant underwent 9 sessions performed on separate days consisting of; three pre-trial practice sessions (no EOD suit worn), one trial familiarisation session (light-weight EOD suit worn) and six experimental sessions (consisting of 6 experimental trials; light-weight EOD suit worn), with a week separating the familiarisation and each experimental session. The experimental trials involved six separate conditions, two without cooling (20 NC and 40 NC), two with head cooling (20 HC and 40 HC) and two with torso cooling (20 TC and 40 TC) performed at 20 °C and 40 °C. Conditions were applied in a randomised cross-over type design. Cooling consisted of a phase change material (PCM) scrum <b>cap</b> (<b>head</b> cooling) and PCM vest (torso cooling) donned by the participant prior to wearing a light-weight 3010 Ergotec EOD suit 15 minutes before each trial. Each trial consisted of 6 activity stations; 1. Treadmill walking (4 km·hr- 1); 2. Manual loading; 3. Searching and crawling; 4. The postural challenge; 5. Unloaded arm ergometry (60 rev·min- 1); 6. The spatial working memory (SWM) test, performed 4 times through to make up 4 cycles lasting a total of 80 minutes per trial. IV RESULTS: There was an increase in physiological, perceptual and cardiovascular strain with duration in all conditions. Physiological strain was greater in 40 °C air than in 20 °C air (p< 0. 001). The heart rate (HR), core temperature (TcP), skin temperature (Tsk), chest temperature (Tc), rate of percieved exertion (RPE), thermal sensation (ThS) and thermal comfort (ThC) responses (excluding Tf) were lowest during the 20 TC trial when compared to 20 HC and 20 NC. At 40 °C, the physiological strain was reduced with both cooling condidions (40 HC and 40 TC). During 40 HC, TcP, Tf, and PhSI, were lowest for upto 60 minutes of activity (3 cycles) when compared to 40 NC. 40 TC produced the lowest Tsk responses for up to 60 minutes of activity (3 cycles) and Tc responses throughout the 80 minute trial, compared to 40 NC and 40 HC. The recovery of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was not comprimised in response to standing at 40 °C, however during both cooling trials within the first cycle at 20 °C MAP did not recover back to the pre-stand reponse. At 40 °C, HR peaked significantly post-stand and remained greater than that during the prestand response. Completion speed of the cognitive spatial working memory test was greatest during the final cycle of activity, (p< 0. 017). CONCLUSION: At 20 °C torso cooling created the most benefit when compared to head cooling at reducing the physiological and perceptual strain experienced. At 40 °C, both cooling methods (TC and HC) were effective at lowering the physiological, perceptual and cardiovascular strain when compared to the non-cooling control (40 NC). The majority of this benefit was observed within the first hour of activity. It is recommended that the torso cooling garment be used within the light-weight EOD suit to reduce the thermal strain experienced at 40 °C, and that when using the light-weight EOD suit at 20 °C the PCM cooling garments are not required as the physiological strain experienced at this temperature is less than that experienced at 40 °...|$|E
