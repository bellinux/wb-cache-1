40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} different indium tin oxide (ITO) surface treatments {{on the performance of}} organic solar <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> different device architectures.

We found that in all cases the short circuit current was the parameter which was most significantly affected by ITO surface treatment. However, the performance of the <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> C 60 layer in contact with ITO was markedly less sensitive to the ITO surface treatments compared to the <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> CuPc in contact <b>with</b> ITO.

5|$|Many {{important}} biochemical reactions, such {{as energy}} generation, use concentration gradients across membranes. The {{general lack of}} internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space.

These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria.

5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg <b>cell</b> <b>with</b> sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process {{would have to be}} repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{quadratic}} probing {{and double}} hashing, linear probing {{is a form}} of open addressing. In these schemes, each cell of a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a <b>cell</b> <b>with</b> a matching key or an empty cell.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} current flow in reverse bias mode {{and its impact}} on conversion efficiency for large-area n-type Cz-Si H-pattern and n-type Cz-Si metal wrap through (MWT) solar cells. Shunting is studied {{as a function of the}} boron emitter doping profile and by comparing MWT <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> two different phosphorus-doped back surface field (BSF) structures. Less shunting is observed for <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> deeper boron-doped emitters (depth d ≈ 700 nm) compared <b>with</b> <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> shallower emitters (d ≈ 500 nm). <b>Cells</b> <b>with</b> a deeper doping profile have initial shunt resistances of RP > 30 kΩ · cm 2 (without prior reverse load), while <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> shallower emitters exhibit initial values of RP ≈ 9 kΩ · cm 2, irrespective of the cell type. Furthermore, <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> deeper boron doping profiles show significantly lower current flows under reverse bias. We observe a halving of the RP-values after reverse biasing the H-pattern and the MWT <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> structured BSF where, on the other hand, the conversion efficiencies are hardly affected. MWT cells featuring a BSF below the external p-type contacts show a drop in conversion efficiency of 0. 3 %abs.

5|$|Antibodies are {{secreted}} by B {{cells of}} the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma, and a membrane-bound form that {{is attached to the}} surface of a B cell and {{is referred to as the}} B-cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B <b>cell</b> <b>with</b> a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.|$|E

5|$|Entities {{undergoing}} {{uniparental inheritance}} and {{with little to}} no recombination {{may be expected to}} be subject to Muller's ratchet, the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost. Animal populations of mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process known as the mtDNA bottleneck. The bottleneck exploits stochastic processes in the cell to increase in the cell-to-cell variability in mutant load as an organism develops: a single egg <b>cell</b> <b>with</b> some proportion of mutant mtDNA thus produces an embryo where different cells have different mutant loads. Cell-level selection may then act to remove those cells with more mutant mtDNA, leading to a stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations. The mechanism underlying the bottleneck is debated, with a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence for a combination of random partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and random turnover of mtDNA molecules within the cell.|$|E
