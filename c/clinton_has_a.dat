2500|$|Following the {{nomination}} of Sarah Palin for the vice presidency at the Republican National Convention, Palin and Clinton were compared and contrasted {{with one another in}} the media, due to their status as women running in the 2008 presidential election. A New York Times article stated, [...] "Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Palin have little in common beyond their breakout performances at the conventions and the soap opera aspects of their family lives.

2500|$|More recently, Hanson has {{appeared}} {{to reject the}} term neoconservative, writing in a 2016 column [...] "Hillary's Neoliberals" [...] that the term neoconservative was coined in the 1970s to describe liberals who moved right on social issues and on maintaining deterrence during the Cold War. Hanson has critiqued the decision of several neoconservatives to declare their support for Hillary Clinton as preferable to Donald Trump on grounds that <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> long history of abuse of office, and is mired in scandal over violations of national security statutes as well as influence peddling between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. Hanson has attacked these neoconservatives as [...] "neoliberals" [...] who were never entirely proper conservative, arguing that these people had joined the Republican Party out of distaste for the Democratic Party, which had nominated as the presidential candidates George McGovern in 1972 and Jimmy Carter in 1976 as opposed to converting to conservatism. [...] Hanson ended his column that there were now two emerging factions in America — the proverbial ordinary Americans supporting Trump vs. the elites of both the Democratic and Republican parties supporting Clinton. Hanson wrote: [...] "A mostly urban, highly educated, and high-income globalized elite often shares more cultural and political affinities with their counterparts {{on the other side}} of the aisle than they do with the lower-middle and working classes of their own parties. Just as Hillary Clinton may feel more comfortable with the old neoconservatives, Trump supporters have little in common with either Clintonites or neocons. Clinton versus Trump is a war of NPR, CBS, and the New York Times against the National Enquirer, conservative talk radio, and the Drudge Report. Clinton supporters such as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, onetime Bush officials Hank Paulson and Brent Scowcroft, and billionaire Meg Whitman certainly have nothing in common with Republican Trump supporters such as Mike Huckabee and Rush Limbaugh. Culture, not just politics, is rapidly destroying—but also rebuilding—traditional political parties." ...|$|E
