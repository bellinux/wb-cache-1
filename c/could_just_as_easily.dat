25|$|The next {{feature to}} be {{discussed}} is the oval shaped curves representing islands of constant efficiency. In this figure we see 11 contours ranging from 56% efficiency (decimal 0.56) to 76% efficiency (decimal 0.76). General standard practice is to interpret these efficiencies as isentropic rather than polytropic. The inclusion of efficiency islands effectively generates a 3-dimensional topology to this 2-dimensional map. With inlet density specified, it provides a further ability to calculate aerodynamic power. Lines of constant power <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> be substituted.|$|E
25|$|This comment has {{traditionally}} caused commentators {{to conclude that}} Luke was a Gentile. If this were true, it would make Luke the only writer of the New Testament who can clearly be identified as not being Jewish. However, {{that is not the}} only possibility. Although Luke is considered likely to be a Gentile Christian, some scholars believe him to be a Hellenized Jew. The phrase <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> be used to differentiate between those Christians who strictly observed the rituals of Judaism and those who did not.|$|E
25|$|As {{its name}} suggests, a shophouse often {{contains}} a shop with separate residential spaces. More generally, space {{occupied by the}} former contains a semi-public function. While this usually is, and historically usually was, a shop, it <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> be a food and beverage outlet (e.g. coffeeshop or bar), a service provider (e.g. clinic or barber), an industrial activity (e.g. cottage industry or auto workshop) or a community space (e.g. a school or clan association). Residential spaces are meant to accommodate one or more families, or serve as a dormitory for single workers. Popular belief holds that shophouses were initially occupied by single families, with their private living areas in one space and the more public family business in another. However, {{it is possible that}} the two spaces were always usually used by unrelated persons or groups, who may be tenants or resident owners. The position of the shop and residential space depends on the number of floors of the shophouse: A single storey shophouse tends to include residential space behind the shop, while residential spaces in shophouses of two or more storeys are typically located above the shop.|$|E

25|$|Fortified {{military}} {{camps and}} watchtowers {{were also used}} on the southeast coast, in this case to stop migration and plundering by the Franks, Angles and Saxons. From about 270, {{attempts were made to}} gain the upper hand over the seaborne attacks of Germanic marauders using heavily fortified strongholds, some of which were newly built. In his chronicle of {{the second half of the}} 4th century Eutropius reported that the commander of the Classis Britannica, Carausius, was tasked in 285 with tackling Frankish and Saxon piracy in the English Channel. The constant raids on the local coasts hindered maritime traffic and in particular the safe transportation of goods and precious metals to Gaul and Rome. The heavily branched river system in Britain enabled the Germanic invaders to quickly penetrate the interior of the island in their small flat boats. As a countermeasure the Roman administration created a separate military district covering both sides of the English Channel. During Carausius' short-lived Britannic Empire, these strategically important fortresses and naval stations were probably manned by his most loyal officers and soldiers, who <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> repel Roman invaders. The exact date of its formation, however, is unknown. However, the military situation in Britain, which was already difficult, worsened still further. The local army command had to face new threats without having enough soldiers available and was therefore forced to withdraw troops from other vulnerable areas of the island.|$|E

Since 1964, this presumption has been disputed by scholars. Careful inspection of the drawing at All Soul's Library shows that it has one pencil inscription: [...] "Play house" [...] , {{which may have been}} added by a librarian or by anyone else. No sign of a signature (by Wren or anyone else) or a date appears anywhere on the drawing. Robert D.

Or in other words, we can almost guarantee that every normal, living, breathing Louisiana-bred girl in attendance at Taylor's show is also obsessed with Britney Spears." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator said that she had no doubts that Swift would cover a Spears song, but was surprised that the song Swift chose was [...] "Lucky".

500|$|Samus' reveal in the {{original}} Metroid, which UGO.com called {{the original}} [...] "jaw-dropping moment" [...] in gaming, was named as the greatest twist in video games by Game Informer in 2007 and as the greatest moment in Nintendo's history by GameDaily in 2008.

[...] According to the 2007 book Gaming Lives in the Twenty-First Century: Literate Connections, Samus was perhaps the most nonsexualized female video game character ever, a belief shared by Steve Rabin in Introduction to Game Development, which also considered Samus as one of Nintendo's most popular video game mascots. In 2002, Justin Hoeger of The Sacramento Bee opined that [...] "unlike most other female video game characters, Samus isn't some husky-voiced bimbo in tight leather included only for sex appeal. Samus is tough, silent, heavily armed and spends most of her time in a bulky suit of high-tech Power Armor." [...] That same year, however, an article in the Toronto Star retorted that the [...] "sexual politics" [...] surrounding Samus and the Metroid series needed to stop, arguing that the original [...] "big crazy shock to the gaming public" [...] was [...] "some seriously misspent energy" [...] as she [...] "is not a woman {{for the benefit of the}} sweaty/excited crowd, and neither is she a standard-bearer nor a courageous leader in the struggle for video game civil rights.

Giger initially offered to completely design the Alien from scratch, but Scott mandated that he base his work on Necronom IV, saying that to start over from the beginning would be too time-consuming.
