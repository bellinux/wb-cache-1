Of high importance to railroad companies {{is the fact that}} steel ties are more economical to install in new construction than <b>creosote-treated</b> <b>wood</b> ties and concrete ties. Steel ties are utilized in nearly all sectors of the worldwide railroad systems including heavy-haul, class 1s, regional, shortlines, mining, electrified passenger lines (OHLE) and all manner of industries. Notably, steel ties (bearers) have proven themselves over the last few decades to be advantageous in turnouts (switches) and provide the solution to the ever-growing problem of long timber ties for such use.|$|E
50|$|Paecilomyces variotii is {{a common}} {{environmental}} mold that is widespread in composts, soils and food products. It is known from substrates including food, indoor air, wood, soil and carpet dust. Paecilomyces variotii is the asexual state of Byssochlamys spectabilis, {{a member of the}} Phylum Ascomycota (Family Trichocomaceae). However, the Byssochlamys state is rarely observed in culture due to the heterothallic nature of this species (i.e., it requires culturing of positive and negative strains in co-culture to produce the teleomorph). Paecilomyces variotii is fast growing, producing powdery to suede-like in colonies that are yellow-brown or sand-colored. It is distinguishable from microscopically from similar microfungi, such as the biverticillate members of the genus Penicillium (affiliated with the genus Talaromyces) by its broadly ellipsoidal to lemon-shaped conidia, loosely branched conidiophores and phialides with pointed tips. Ascospores of the sexual state, B. spectabilis, are strongly heat-resistant. As such, the fungus {{is a common}} contaminant of heat-treated foods and juices. It is also known from decaying wood and <b>creosote-treated</b> <b>wood</b> utility poles. Paecilomyces variotii has been associated with a number of infective diseases of humans and animals. It is also an important indoor environmental contaminant.|$|E

The objective {{was to assess the}} feasibility _ [...] _. of using creosot&treated southern pine wood as a raw material for the-formulation-of-phenol-basedresmadhesives-Them liquefaction was conducted in the presence of phenol with sulfuric acid as a catalyst at reaction temperature and time of 150 °C and 60 minutes, respectively. Novolac and resole resins were formulated from the liquefied wood, and their physical and mechanical properties of molding compounds made with them were determined. Residues obtained from samples of liquefied <b>creosote-treated</b> <b>wood</b> (5. 8 %) were significantly lower than those from non-treated birch wood powder (17. 3 %). Apparently, the residual creosote content of the treated-wood behaved as a reagent co:working with phenol to enhance the liquefaction. The flexural strength and the flexural modulus of moldings made from novolac. resins prepared from liquefied creosotetreated wood were comparable to novolacs made from non-treated birch wood. Bond quality of southern pine plywood made from liquefied <b>creosote-treated</b> <b>wood</b> resin was only slightly lower than plywood made from conventional phenolic resin. Visual examination of the wood failure on broken shear specimens seemed to indicate overpenetration of the resin made from liquefied <b>creosote-treated</b> <b>wood,</b> and it {{was probably one of the}} major causes of lower bond quality. Nevertheless, the first attempt to formulate a phenol-based adhesive made from liquefied <b>creosote-treated</b> <b>wood</b> produced encouraging results.

40|$|The {{volatile}} {{composition of}} 20 -year-old out-of-service <b>creosote-treated</b> railway <b>wood</b> sleepers was studied. The emitted volatile fraction was collected {{by means of}} dynamic purge-and-trap concentration at ambient temperature, and analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) hyphenated with mass spectrometric detection systems, using quadrupole (GC × GC/qMS) and time-of-flight (GC × GC/ToF-MS) mass analyzers and selective nitrogen-phosphorus detection (GC × GC-NPD). The analysis of mass spectrometry data and GC × GC retention time allowed the tentative identification of about 300 compounds based on spectrometric data and positioning of each compound in the GC × GC plot. Major important headspace components are polyaromatic hydrocarbons, phenols and benzene derivatives, hydrocarbons and heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen atoms. Many of the reported compounds are listed as belonging to toxicological substance classes which have been related to harmful health effects. GC × GC provides greater speciation and evidence of composition heterogenicity of the sample than one-dimensional GC analysis, thus allowing to better demonstrate its potential toxicity. Data obtained by specific detection systems for N-heterocycles assisted mass data interpretation assignments. The enhanced separation power obtained after GC × GC compared to one-dimensional gas chromatography (1 D-GC) together with spectral deconvolution and correlation with physical-chemical data, allowed the identification of complex isomer clusters, as demonstrated for alkylquinolines, and applied also to alkylphenols, alkylbenzenes and alkylnaphthalenes...|$|R
40|$|If a {{small-scale}} {{clean coal}} fueled power plant is co-fueled with 5 % of <b>creosote-treated</b> used-up sleeper <b>wood,</b> the decontamination by carbonisation at 500 °C in an indirectly heated rotary kiln with the diameter 1. 7 m and effective length 10 m can be realized. It {{should be included}} in the " 3 R Clean Coal Carbonisation Plant" system, which processes coal. It will improve the heat balance of the system, since the carbonisation of wood will deliver a lot of high caloricity pyroligneous vapour to the joint furnace of the " 3 R Clean Coal Carbonisation Plant". Pine wood sleeper sapwood contains 0. 25 % of sulphur, but the average pine sleeper wood (sapwood and heartwood) 0. 05 % of sulphur. Most of the sulphur is lost with the pyroligneous vapour and burned in the furnace. Since the " 3 R Clean Coal Carbonisation Plant" is equipped with a flue gases cleaning system, the SO 2 emission level will not exceed 5 mg/m 3. The charcoal of the sapwood portion of sleepers and that of the average sleeper wood will contain 0. 22 % and 0. 035 % of sulphur, respectively. The increase of the carbonisation temperature does not substantially decrease the sulphur content in charcoal, although it is sufficiently low, and the charcoal can be co-fired with clean coal. The considered process is suitable for small power plants, if the biomass input in the common energy balance is 5 to 10 %. If the mean distance of sleepers transportation for Central and Eastern Europe is estimated not to exceed 200 km, the co-combustion of clean coal and carbonized sleepers would be an acceptable option from the environmental and economic points of view...|$|R

40|$|Liquefaction of spent <b>creosote-treated</b> <b>wood</b> was {{studied to}} {{determine}} the technological practicability of its application in converting treated wood waste into resin adhesives. A total of 144 plywood panels were fabricated with experimental variables included 2 phenol to wood (P/W) ratios in liquefaction, 6 resin formulations (3 formaldehyde/liquefied wood (F/LW) ratios × 2 replications), 6 glue applications (2 glue spreads × 3 assembly times), and 2 panel replications. Average shear strength (235. 6 psi) and wood failure (70. 5 %) for resin adhesives prepared from liquefied wood at P/W ratio of 2. 0 {{were significantly higher than}} the shear strength (184. 7 psi) and wood failure (53. 1 %) for that at P/W ratio of 1. 5. On average, F/LW ratio of 2. 25 yielded substantially lower shear strength and wood failure than that of F/LW ratios of 2. 0 and 1. 75. Differences in shear strength and wood failure between F/LW ratios of 2. 0 and 1. 75 were not significant. However, {{it is interesting to note}} that F/LW ratio interacted with P/W ratio to affect wood failure, but not shear strength. As shown in Fig. 2, at P/W ratio of 1. 5, the F/LW ratio of 2. 0 yielded the highest wood failure and the F/LW ratio of 2. 25 resulted in the lowest wood failure. On the contrary, at P/W ratio of 2. 0, the F/LW ratio of 2. 25 resulted in highest wood failure and the F/LW ratio of 2. 0 yielded the lowest wood failure.

This paper {{is presented to}} discuss general combustion/emissions issues with biomass cofiring, as well as specific issues with particular biomass fuels, such as slagging/fouling. Biomass cofiring in large industrial and utility coal-fired boilers is a practical approach for increasing renewable energy given the wide availability, existing capital investment, and established performance of coal-fired boilers for providing efficient, low cost power [1 - 3]. Although some utility biomass cofiring is successfully practiced in the U. S. and abroad, establishing long-term reliability and improving economics are still significant needs. In light of the cost limitations in shipping distance (e. g., 50 - 100 miles or less) from collection to end-use based on the low energy density of biomass, resource availability is a site-specific consideration that needs {{to take into account}} the situation in nearby utility and industrial boilers.

40|$|Disposal of preservative-treated {{waste wood}} {{is a growing}} problem worldwide. Bioprocessing the treated wood offers one {{approach}} to waste management under certain conditions. One goal is to use wood decay fungi to reduce the volume of waste with an easily managed system in a cost-effective manner. Wood decay fungi were obtained from culture collections in the Mycology Center and Biodeterioration research unit at the USDA-FS Forest Products Laboratory (FPL), Madison, Wisconsin, and from FPL field sites. The 95 isolates had originally been taken from at least 66 sites from around the United States. Isolates were screened in a bioassay (known as the ‘choice test’) for tolerance to CCA, ACQ, creosote and pentachlorophenol. A tolerant rating was based on fungal growth toward or on treated wood, with 17 tolerant to CCA, 21 to ACQ, 12 to creosote and 5 to pentachlorophenol. Decay capacity of the tolerant isolates was determined as percent weight loss by the ASTM D- 1413 - 76 soil bottle method. We identified 8 isolates for experiments on preservative remediation.

The feasibility of using a composting technique inoculated with the cellulose degrading actinomycetesThermobifidafusca as a mesophilic/thermophilic bioremediation option to degrade phenolic compounds in creosote treated wood waste was evaluated.

40|$|PAHs {{are major}} {{constituents}} of creosote, {{and it has}} been suggested that their volatilization from treated wood could make a major contribution to the U. K. atmospheric emission inventories. This paper reports a study to elucidate the volatilization characteristics of selected PAHs from <b>creosote-treated</b> <b>wood</b> and to estimate the potential significance of this source to the U. K. atmospheric source inventory. Desorption kinetics from untreated and treated wood were measured at 4 and 30 °C for five PAHs (acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene) using chambers in the laboratory. Rates of desorption followed first-order kinetics for all compounds and were higher at 30 than 4 °C. Mean ∑PAH fluxes varied from 2. 57 ± 1. 52 to 29. 5 ± 6. 1 mg/m 2 treated wood/day at 4 and 30 °C, respectively. A prolonged study of the kinetics at 4 °C showed that the volatilization rate remained constant over about 7 weeks, after which > 85 % of the compounds still remained sorbed on the wood. Initial desorption rates were governed by partitioning between the substrate (wood) and air and subsequently by the rates of compound diffusion from the interstices of the wood. A strong negative correlation was observed when the percent increment in the desorption rate from 4 to 30 °C was plotted as a function of the octanol−air partition coefficient (KOA) (r 2 = − 0. 93); vapor pressure was strongly positively cor related (r 2 = 0. 92). Desorption half-lives ranged from 0. 7 to 31 yr at 4 °C and from 0. 3 to 1 yr at 30 °C for fluoranthene and acenaphthene, respectively. Estimates of annual U. K. emissions for the compounds specified from freshly treated wood (i. e., ignoring long-term releases from previously treated wood) were subject to a number of important assumptions, but were in the range of 100 t ∑PAH. This is less than the annual U. K. emissions of ∑PAHs estimated for domestic heating (600 t) and believed to be similar to that from vehicle emissions (80 t) at the present time...|$|E
