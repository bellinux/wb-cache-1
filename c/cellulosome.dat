30|$|However, {{synthetic}} <b>cellulosomes</b> constructed so far {{are less}} active than their natural counterparts. Construction of better complexes is required with efficient catalytic activity than the wild <b>cellulosomes.</b> Thus, more efforts are being made to construct broad substrate-range mini-cellulosomes (Fontes and Gilbert 2010) and multiple scaffoldin units in larger <b>cellulosomes</b> (Fan et al. 2012) for biofuel production at the industrial scale (Alper and Stephanopoulos 2009).|$|R
30|$|In view of this, {{efforts are}} being made to artificially {{construct}} the <b>cellulosomes</b> to depolymerize the cellulosic substrate to simple fermentable sugars for biofuel production. Moreover, with increase in understanding the physiology and mechanism of gene regulation of <b>cellulosomes,</b> efforts {{are being made}} {{for the expression of}} cellulosomal complexes in recombinant microorganisms (Nataf et al. 2010). During the past few years, efforts have been made for the construction of “designer cellulosomes”, i.e., artificial complexes that could efficiently depolymerize cellulose. The construction of designer <b>cellulosomes</b> is very challenging, but this technology can be efficiently improved and utilized in the biorefineries (Fontes and Gilbert 2010).|$|R
30|$|Anaerobic biomass {{degrading}} microbes breakdown biomass {{with the}} use of cell-surface linked discrete multi-enzyme complexes, called <b>cellulosomes.</b> These are arrays of multiple cellulase and hemicellulase proteins, assembled by specific interactions between ‘dockerin’ domains on the enzyme and ‘cohesins’ bound to structural scaffoldins on microbial surface [16, 17]. Designing of optimized <b>cellulosomes</b> by synthesizing hybrid scaffoldin molecules that contain cohesins with different binding specificity from different organisms is another recent approach to develop more active cellulose degrading enzymes [20]. Synergies between purified cellulases and xylanases from the thermophilic bacterium, Thermobifida fusca displayed on designer <b>cellulosomes</b> were found to possess higher activity on wheat straw than the corresponding free enzymes [42].|$|R

50|$|The <b>cellulosome</b> {{consists}} of a multi-functional integrating subunit (called scaffoldin), responsible for organizing the various cellulolytic subunits (e.g., the enzymes) into the complex. Within a <b>cellulosome,</b> multiple endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, xylanases and other degradative enzymes work synergistically to attack heterogeneous, insoluble cellulose substrates. This is accomplished by the interaction of two complementary classes of module, located on the two separate types of interacting subunits, i.e., a cohesin module on the scaffoldin and a dockerin module on each enzymatic subunit. The high-affinity cohesin-dockerin interaction defines the <b>cellulosome</b> structure. Attachment of the <b>cellulosome</b> to its substrate is mediated by a scaffoldin-borne cellulose-binding module (CBM) that comprises part of the scaffoldin subunit. Much of our understanding of its catalytic components, architecture, and mechanisms of attachment to the bacterial cell and to cellulose, has been derived {{from the study of}} Clostridium thermocellum.|$|E

30|$|Designer <b>cellulosomes</b> (also {{known as}} chimeras)—unlike native cellulosomes—are {{artificial}} constructs, composed of chimeric scaffoldin and enzymes with cohesins and dockerins of divergent specificities, thus providing interdomain {{flexibility in the}} enzyme complex while maintaining (to some extent) the original wild-type functionality (Fierobe et al. 2002; Stern et al. 2015). Although synthetic <b>cellulosomes</b> present faster hydrolysis rates than non-composite cellulase mixtures, Zhang (2011) remarked {{that there is a}} limitation in the understanding of why synthetic <b>cellulosomes</b> constructed to date have been much less active than their natural counterparts. This may be due to factors such as changes in the microenvironments of the active sites, possible unproductive competition between functionally similar enzymes, difficulties in component arrangement as well as the nature of the peptide linker.|$|R
5000|$|Dockerin is {{a protein}} domain {{found in the}} <b>cellulosome</b> {{cellular}} structure of anaerobic bacteria. It is found on many endoglucanase enzymes.

30|$|Extremely {{efficient}} nanomachines, {{known as}} <b>cellulosomes,</b> {{are produced by}} many anaerobic and ruminal microorganisms to degrade the complex polysaccharides of plant cell wall and crystalline cellulose (Hyeon et al. 2013). Such supramolecular complexes were first discovered in thermophilic bacterium C. thermocellum. <b>Cellulosomes</b> are multienzyme complexes held together by the high affinity of interaction among its subunits (Gefen et al. 2012). Major functions of <b>cellulosomes</b> include {{a high rate of}} substrate uptake, tight and specific interaction with the substrate, synergistic activity and processivity of the enzymes (Desvaux 2005). Cellulosomic complexes have been investigated in many other species including Clostridium acetobutylicum, C. josui, C. cellulovorans, C. papyrosolvens, C. cellulolyticum, C. clariflavum, Bacteroides cellulosolvens, Ruminococcus albus, R. flavefaciens and Acetivibrio cellulolyticus (Cho et al. 2010; Hemme et al. 2010; Karpol et al. 2013; Smith and Bayer 2013; Ichikawa et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Clostridium thermocellum <b>cellulosomes</b> {{isolated}} by cellulose {{affinity chromatography}} were fractionated by anion exchange chromatography into apparently homogeneous subpopulations that differed {{with respect to}} enzyme activity and subunit composition. One such subpopulation contained predominantly six subunits and was closely similar to the ''subcellulosome'' described by Kobayashi et al. (Kobayashi, T., Romaniec, M. P. M., Fauth, U., and Demain, A. L., Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 1990, 56, 3040 - 3046). Avicelase specific activity of this homogeneous subpopulation was slightly {{higher than that of}} unfractionated <b>cellulosomes,</b> but the two preparations were similarly affected by Ca 2 +, dithiothreitol, and cellobiose. Determination of their N-terminal sequences and enzyme activities has enabled three of the six major subunits of the subpopulation of <b>cellulosomes</b> to be positively identified as known components of the C. thermocellum cellulase complex; the other three subunits did nor match up with previously characterized cellulosomal proteins...|$|R
30|$|However, {{apart from}} various advantages, surface display also suffers from few shortcomings. The amount of cellulosomal enzymes to be {{displayed}} {{is dependent on}} the available surface area (Yamada et al. 2013). Also, the unifunctional surface-displayed <b>cellulosomes</b> are not capable of 2 -D diffusion (Tanaka and Kondo 2015). Apart from this, the cohesin–dockerin interactions are species specific, which restricts their utilization over a narrow range. Another problem with the surface-displayed <b>cellulosomes</b> is the effective cellulosomal assembly over the cell surface and higher specific activity of the enzymes.|$|R
50|$|Cellulosomes {{exist as}} {{extracellular}} complexes {{that are either}} attached to the cell wall of bacteria or free in solution, where the insoluble substrate {{can be broken down}} into soluble products and taken up by the cell. The large size and heterogeneity of cellulosomes from the best-characterized organisms (i.e., C. thermocellum, C. cellulolyticum, and C. cellulovorans) have greatly complicated efforts to probe <b>cellulosome</b> structure and function. Other <b>cellulosome</b> systems (such as those from Acetivibrio cellulolyticus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) appear to be even more intricate.|$|E

30|$|The {{catalytic}} domains, i.e., cellulosomal enzymes are {{assembled by}} their dockerin moieties linked to cohesin domains of scaffoldin by calcium dependent interactions (Cho et al. 2010; Ding et al. 2008). Localization of broad substrate range enzymes and their close proximity for efficient formation of enzyme–substrate complex are the significant factors {{for increasing the}} efficiency of the <b>cellulosomes.</b> <b>Cellulosomes</b> are known to have better enzymatic activity as compared to free enzymes because of the close proximity of various cellulases which act synergistically (Blanchette et al. 2012; Krauss et al. 2012; You et al. 2012 a). However, the mechanism of protein assembly and organization of various catalytic enzymes in the <b>cellulosomes</b> is partially known (Wilson 2011). The complex architecture of the cellulosomal complex helps to minimize the diffusion of several smaller saccharides and facilitate their easy and fast uptake by glycosidases for complete hydrolysis (Vodovnik and Logar 2010). The cellulosomal microorganisms can vary the composition of various catalytic subunits according to the substrate available to them (Cho et al. 2010; Blouzard et al. 2010; Tsai et al. 2010). A variety of <b>cellulosomes</b> with variable composition can be assembled on a single species with various enzymes bound to the scaffolding protein (Bomble et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|At {{the current}} rate of use the crude oil {{reserves}} of the world are predicted to deplete in about 40 years. Therefore, it has become necessary to find and devise methods of processing a renewable raw material for conversion into transportation fuel. Some countries are manufacturing ethanol from sugarcane or cereal grains and blending it with petrol to reduce crude oil imports. This entails diverting agriculturally productive land for the production of fuel. An alternative is to use inedible plant biomass as raw material. Although plant biomass is mostly cellulose, it is covered and occluded by hemicelluloses and lignin. This greatly limits the access of microbial cellulases required to depolymerize cellulose and release glucose for production of alcohol by yeast-mediated fermentation. A possible solution may be based on the reactions that take place in the rumen of herbivores. These animals have symbiotic bacteria which have multienzyme particles called <b>cellulosomes</b> attached onto their surface. The <b>cellulosomes</b> tear down the ingested plant material into soluble compounds from which the host animal makes milk and meat. Genetic engineering techniques offer the possibility of enhancing the biodegradative action of <b>cellulosomes</b> by reconstituting <b>cellulosomes</b> with potent enzymes from different microbial species.

At the time, they weren’t looking for enzymes or cellulosomes at all. They simply sought a ‘cellulose-binding factor’ or ‘CBF’ on the cell surface of the anaerobic thermophilic bacterium, C. thermocellum, which they inferred would account for the observation that the bacterium attaches strongly to the insoluble cellulose substrate prior to its degradation. They employed a then unconventional experimental approach, in which they isolated an adherence-defective mutant of the bacterium and prepared a specific polyclonal antibody for detection of the functional component. Surprisingly, they isolated a very large multi-sub-unit supra-molecular complex, instead of a small protein. A combination of biochemical, biophysical, immun-ochemical and ultra-structural techniques, followed by molecular biological verification, led to the definition and proof of the <b>cellulosome</b> concept. The birth of the discrete, multi-enzyme <b>cellulosome</b> complex was thus documented [...]|$|E

50|$|The scaffoldin {{component}} of the cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum is a non-hydrolytic protein which organises the hydrolytic enzymes into a large complex, called the <b>cellulosome.</b> Scaffoldin comprises a series of functional domains, amongst which is a single cellulose-binding domain and nine cohesin domains which are responsible for integrating the individual enzymatic subunits into the complex.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous [...] "signature" [...] {{sequences}} {{known as}} dockerins and cohesins {{have been identified}} in the genomes of bacteria that produce <b>cellulosomes.</b> Depending on their amino acid sequence and tertiary structures, cellulases are divided into clans and families.|$|R
30|$|The {{concept of}} {{designer}} <b>cellulosomes</b> was first suggested by Bayer et al. (1994) {{and the first}} attempt of construction and utility was accomplished by Fierobe et al. (2001). Designer <b>cellulosomes</b> are artificially constructed complexes of enzymes, generally equipped with a dockerin module that interacts with cohesin module with high specificity and affinity and degrades the polymeric cellulose efficiently (Vazana et al. 2012). The arrangement of different cellulosomal subunits enables controlling the composition and spatial constraints, thereby increasing {{the efficiency of the}} whole system (Bayer et al. 2007). Hence, the disruption of the chain in the cellulose is the rate-limiting step rather than the cleavage of the glycosidic bond, thereby rendering the substrate easily accessible to enzyme for the hydrolysis.|$|R
40|$|Biomass {{conversion}} to ethanol as a liquid fuel by the thermophilic and anaerobic clostridia offers a potential partial {{solution to the}} problem of the world's dependence on petroleum for energy. Coculture of a cellulolytic strain and a saccharolytic strain of Clostridium on agricultural resources, as well as on urban and industrial cellulosic wastes, is a promising approach to an alternate energy source from an economic viewpoint. This review discusses the need for such a process, the cellulases of clostridia, their presence in extracellular complexes or organelles (the <b>cellulosomes),</b> the binding of the <b>cellulosomes</b> to cellulose and to the cell surface, cellulase genetics, regulation of their synthesis, cocultures, ethanol tolerance, and metabolic pathway engineering for maximizing ethanol yield...|$|R
50|$|Cellodextrins {{are created}} through the {{cleavage}} of cellulose in most anaerobic bacteria by the <b>cellulosome</b> (an amalgamation of cellulolytic enzymes {{on the outside}} of a cell).

50|$|In {{anaerobic}} {{bacteria that}} degrade plant cell walls, exemplified by Clostridium thermocellum, the dockerin domains of the catalytic polypeptides can bind equally well to any cohesin {{from the same}} organism. More recently, anaerobic fungi, typified by Piromyces equi, have been suggested to also synthesise a <b>cellulosome</b> complex, although the dockerin sequences of the bacterial and fungal enzymes are completely different. For example, the fungal enzymes contain one, two or three copies of the dockerin sequence in tandem within the catalytic polypeptide. In contrast, all the C. thermocellum <b>cellulosome</b> catalytic components contain a single dockerin domain. The anaerobic bacterial dockerins are homologous to EF hands (calcium-binding motifs) and require calcium for activity whereas the fungal dockerin does not require calcium. Finally, the interaction between cohesin and dockerin appears to be species specific in bacteria, {{there is almost no}} species specificity of binding within fungal species and no identified sites that distinguish different species.|$|E
50|$|Carbohydrate-binding module family 10 (CBM10) {{is found}} in two {{distinct}} sets of proteins with different functions. Those found in aerobic bacteria bind cellulose (or other carbohydrates); but in anaerobic fungi they are protein binding domains, referred to as dockerin domains.

40|$|Background: Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum and Lachnoclostridium phytofermentans (formerly {{known as}} Clostridium cellulolyticum and Clostridium phytofermentans, respectively) are {{anaerobic}} bacteria that developed different strategies to depolymerize the cellulose {{and the related}} plant cell wall polysaccharides. Thus, R. cellulolyticum produces large extracellular multi-enzyme complexes termed <b>cellulosomes,</b> while L. phytofermentans secretes in the environment some cellulose-degrading enzymes as free enzymes. In the present study, the major cellulase from L. phytofermentans was introduced as a free enzyme or as a cellulosomal component in R. cellulolyticum to improve its cellulolytic capacities. Results: The gene at locus Cphy_ 3367 encoding the major cellulase Cel 9 A from L. phytofermentans and an engineered gene coding for a modified enzyme harboring a R. cellulolyticum C-terminal dockerin were cloned in an expression vector. After electrotransformation of R. cellulolyticum, both forms of Cel 9 A {{were found to be}} secreted by the corresponding recombinant strains. On minimal medium containing microcrystalline cellulose as the sole source of carbon, the strain secreting the free Cel 9 A started to grow sooner and consumed cellulose faster than the strain producing the cellulosomal form of Cel 9 A, or the control strain carrying an empty expression vector. All strains reached the same final cell density but the strain producing the cellulosomal form of Cel 9 A was unable to completely consume the available cellulose even after an extended cultivation time, conversely to the two other strains. Analyses of their <b>cellulosomes</b> showed that the engineered form of Cel 9 A bearing a dockerin was successfully incorporated in the complexes, but its integration induced an important release of regular cellulosomal components such as the major cellulase Cel 48 F, which severely impaired the activity of the complexes on cellulose. In contrast, the <b>cellulosomes</b> synthesized by the control and the free Cel 9 A-secreting strains displayed similar composition and activity. Finally, the most cellulolytic strain secreting free Cel 9 A, was also characterized by an early production of lactate, acetate and ethanol as compared to the control strain. Conclusions: Our study shows that the cellulolytic capacity of R. cellulolyticum can be augmented by supplementing the <b>cellulosomes</b> with a free cellulase originating from L. phytofermentans, whereas integration of the heterologous enzyme in the <b>cellulosomes</b> is rather unfavorable...|$|R

40|$|The man 5 K gene of Clostridium cellulolyticum was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli.

Mature Man 5 K displays 62 % identity with ManA from Clostridium cellulovorans. Two forms of the protein were purified from E. coli; one form corresponds to the full-length enzyme (45 kDa), and a truncated form (39 kDa) lacks the N-terminal dockerin module. Both forms exhibit the same typical family 5 mannanase substrate preference; they are very active with the galactomannan locust bean gum, and the more galacto-substituted guar gum molecules are degraded less. The truncated form, however, displays fourfold-higher activity with galactomannans than the full-length enzyme. Man 5 K was successfully overproduced in C. cellulolyticum by using expression vectors. The trans-produced protein {{was found to be}} incorporated into the <b>cellulosomes</b> and became one of the major enzymatic components. Modified <b>cellulosomes</b> displayed 20 -fold-higher specific activities than control fractions on galactomannan substrates, whereas the specific activity on crystalline cellulose was reduced by 20 %.
