40|$|International audienceIn the {{aeronautical}} field, {{some parts}} are forged and consequently some fibers orientation occurs. However, the thin walls {{are hard to}} get with forging method.

The ratio between the final weight of part and the final weight of <b>chips</b> is approximately 80 %.

Here, the two rivers almost meet but their path is blocked by a rocky outcrop of the Cotswolds, almost creating an island for the ancient hilltop town of Malmesbury to sit on.
