50|$|After {{the last}} solute has been eluted, it is {{necessary}} to strip the displacer from the column. Since the displacer was chosen for high affinity, this can pose a challenge. On reverse-phase materials, a wash with a high percentage of organic solvent may suffice. Large pH shifts are also often employed. One effective strategy is to remove the displacer by chemical reaction; for instance if hydrogen ion was used as displacer it can be removed by reaction with hydroxide, or a polyvalent metal ion can be removed by reaction with a chelating agent. For some matrices, reactive groups on the stationary phase can be titrated to temporarily eliminate the binding sites, for instance weak-acid ion exchangers or <b>chelating</b> <b>resins</b> can be converted to the protonated form. For gel-type ion exchangers, selectivity reversal at very high ionic strength can also provide a solution.

In 0. 5 g AFH/L (0. 001 M NaNO 3) suspensions, arsenate sorption to the resins was proportional to the degree of acidification of the AFH suspensions by the resins. H+-enhanced dissolution of ferrihydrite artificially increased the arsenate in solution, causing a consistent overestimation of potential arsenate bioavailability. Resin-induced acidification was decreased with increasing suspension concentration. Arsenate sorption to the resins in 0. 5 g/L suspensions at pH 8 decreased with increasing NaNO 3 concentrations, reflecting the decreasing activity of arsenate under these conditions.
