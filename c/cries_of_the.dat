They resemble the <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common swift, but are softer and less wheezy.

Following his departure, Spencer Chamberlain became lead vocalist. The band then released They're Only Chasing Safety and Define the Great Line, gaining a certified gold rating for both. These two albums {{have given them}} more mainstream and commercial success.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-level}} {{delegation of}} the Soviet Central Committee flew to Poland {{in an attempt}} to block removing pro-Soviet members of Politburo mainly Soviet and Polish Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky. Soviet delegation was led by Nikita Khrushchev and included Anastas Mikoyan, Nikolai Bulganin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Ivan Konev, and others. The negotiations were tense; both Polish and Soviet troops were put on alert, engaged in 'manoeuvres', and were used as thinly veiled threats. The Polish leadership {{made it clear that the}} face of communism had to become more nationalized; no longer could the Soviet Union directly control the Polish people. Here, Khrushchev's speech worked against him. During Stalinism, the Soviet Union had placed Moscow-friendly Poles, or Russians themselves, in important political positions in Poland. After denouncing Stalinism so vehemently in his speech, Khrushchev could not regress to the Stalinist position by forcing more Russians into the Polish leadership. The Poles, in recognizing the <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public, needed to keep the Soviets from direct control but could not raise their demands to a point that endangered their relationships in the bloc. Gomułka demanded increased autonomy and permission to carry out some reforms but also reassured the Soviets that the reforms were internal matters and that Poland had no intention of abandoning communism or its treaties with the Soviet Union. The Soviets were also pressured by the Chinese to accommodate the Polish demands and were increasingly distracted by the events in Hungary. Eventually, when Khrushchev was reassured that Gomułka would not alter the basic foundations of Polish communism, he withdrew the invasion threat and agreed to compromise, and Gomułka was confirmed in his new position.|$|E

25|$|There were secret {{staircases}} {{and hidden}} spaces which {{were used to}} overhear the discussions in the prison cells. The ceiling of the torture chamber was especially designed to muffle the <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victims. Inside the torture chamber, furnaces and grates were also present. Up to 1850 the chambers were shown to visitors after which time the ecclesiastical authorities of Avignon decided to shut them down. In a similar vein the torture chamber of the Spanish Inquisition in Lima, Peru had one metre thick walls so that the screams of the victims could not penetrate them.|$|E
25|$|One {{prominent}} Buddhist story {{tells of}} Avalokiteśvara vowing never to rest {{until he had}} freed all sentient beings from saṃsāra. Despite strenuous effort, he realizes that still many unhappy beings were yet to be saved. After struggling to comprehend the needs of so many, his head splits into eleven pieces. Amitābha, seeing his plight, gives him eleven heads with which to hear the <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suffering. Upon hearing these cries and comprehending them, Avalokiteśvara attempts {{to reach out to}} all those who needed aid, but found that his two arms shattered into pieces. Once more, Amitābha comes to his aid and invests him with a thousand arms with which to aid the suffering multitudes.|$|E
25|$|Several Hindu stories present {{alternate}} {{aspects of}} Parvati, {{such as the}} ferocious, violent aspect as Shakti and related forms. Shakti is pure energy, untamed, unchecked and chaotic. Her wrath crystallizes into a dark, blood-thirsty, tangled-hair Goddess with an open mouth and a drooping tongue. This goddess is usually identified as the terrible Mahakali or Kali (time). In Linga Purana, Parvati metamorphoses into Kali, on the request of Shiva, to destroy a female asura (demoness) Daruka. Even after destroying the demoness, Kali's wrath could not be controlled. To lower Kali's rage, Shiva appeared as a crying baby. The <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baby raised the maternal instinct of Kali who resorts back to her benign form as Parvati.|$|E

25|$|Zeus, {{pressed by}} the <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hungry people {{and by the}} other deities who also heard their anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone. However, it was a rule of the Fates that whoever {{consumed}} food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Before Persephone was released to Hermes, who {{had been sent to}} retrieve her, Hades tricked her into eating pomegranate seeds, (either six or four according to the telling) which forced her to return to the underworld for some months each year. She was obliged to remain with Hades for six or four months (one month per seed) and lived above ground with her mother {{for the rest of the}} year. This left a long period of time when Demeter was unhappy due to Persephone's absence, neglecting to cultivate the earth. When Persephone returned to the surface, Demeter became joyful and cared for the earth again.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} {{construction}} of the torture chamber of the papal palace at Avignon, used during the Inquisition, {{has been described as}} ingenious. The construction of some of the torture chambers at Avignon was based on principles of Acoustics, specifically designed to muffle the screams and <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tortured. The walls of the torture chamber recessed and protruded in a complementary fashion to the walls on the opposite side so as to reflect the screams of the victims locally, ensuring that their shrieks would not be carried to the exterior. A chamber located above the main torture chamber had a dungeon with a hole near {{the middle of the floor}} through which, according to accounts, the tortured bodies of the prisoners were thrown into a cavity. The chamber where the victims were being burnt was of circular construction and resembled the furnace of a glass-house with a funnel-like chimney at the top.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, keyboardist Christopher Dudley joined Underoath, and the five-song, forty-minute long record, <b>Cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Past was released, quickly selling 3,000 copies. In 2001, Takehold Records {{was bought}} out by Seattle's Tooth & Nail Records and Underoath was {{subsequently}} signed to the label's subsidiary, Solid State Records. In January 2002, bassist Grant Brandell joined Underoath. The band then {{began working on}} their Solid State debut, The Changing of Times, with <b>Cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Past producer James Paul Wisner. The album was released on February 26, 2002, and produced one single titled [...] "When the Sun Sleeps". Dallas Taylor explained that the lyrics on The Changing of Times were about [...] "people playing with other people's emotions {{and how it can}} leave you bitter" [...] and [...] "struggling through life's hardships and trying to find God in all of it." [...] The band was criticized by critics and long-time fans for the album's style because it had changed from the sound of their previous releases. However, The Changing of Times went on to outsell both of their earlier releases combined.|$|E
500|$|As of 2014, {{the song}} has {{appeared}} in more than 40 different albums either remixed or in its original format. The song propelled Clarkson to success in mainstream pop music and {{was regarded as a}} power pop milestone in the 2000s. Maura Johnston from Billboard asserted that [...] "the song inspired covers from all corners—Ted Leo, Kidz Bop—and helped prime the pop world for tracks like Pink's [...] "Who Knew" [...] and Paramore's [...] "Misery Business", not to mention later Clarkson hits like [...] "My Life Would Suck Without You". Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Can anyone do bitter better? Nothing packs more romantic rage than the original Idol's 2004 kiss-off to a coldhearted ex." [...] The song was ranked by Pitchfork Media as the 21st best track of the 2000s; they wrote that [...] "'Since U Been Gone' gave us one of the most blunt rallying <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last ten years, a perfectly realized sing-along chorus that will be a karaoke staple for years." [...] In 2014, The Atlantic magazine dubbed [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] as the best pop song of the past decade.|$|E
500|$|As {{demonstrated}} {{on their}} first release, Act of Depression, Underoath initially played a combination of hardcore and metalcore mixed with black metal and death metal. The band kept a similar sound on their second album, <b>Cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Past, featuring occasional traces of black metal, but the band later moved away from this style to embrace a more melodic-leaning post-hardcore sound. On the follow up release, Underoath stood [...] "at the heavy metal crossroads on The Changing of Times, a hardcore album that parallels classic arena rock." [...] The band experimented with electronic elements, with Casey Boland of Alternative Press noting that the album [...] "was an Olympic pole vault-like leap forward for Underoath," [...] and that the band was [...] "welcoming the process of evolution." [...] He also noted the addition of Aaron Gillespie's clean singing, which offered [...] "a compelling counterpoint and presaged a swarm of bands adopting the sing-scream dichotomy that would become the hallmark of 'screamo.'" [...] Cross Rhythms noted {{the growing popularity of}} the band, and described them as playing [...] "an interesting mix of hardcore and indie rock, utilising loops, keyboards, acoustic guitars and melodic vocal harmonies, amongst the onslaught of heavy guitars and screeching hardcore vocals." ...|$|E

500|$|Mae West {{had already}} {{established}} {{herself as a}} comedic performer when her 1926 Broadway show Sex made national headlines. Tried and convicted of indecency by the New York City District Attorney, she served eight days in prison. West carefully constructed a stage persona and carried it over into her interviews and personal appearances. Despite her voluptuous physique, most of her appeal lay in her suggestive manner. She became a wordsmith {{in the art of}} the come-on and the seductive line, and despite her obvious appeal to male audiences, was popular with women as well. Over the <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> censors, West got her start in the film Night After Night (1932), which starred George Raft and Constance Cummings, as a Texas Guinan-esque supporting character. She agreed to appear in the film only after producers agreed to let her write her own lines. In West's first line on film, after a hat check girl remarks [...] "Goodness, what beautiful diamonds", West replies, [...] "Goodness {{had nothing to do with}} it, dearie." [...] Raft, who had wanted Texas Guinan herself for the role that went to West, later wrote, [...] "In this picture, Mae West stole everything but the cameras." [...] She went on to make She Done Him Wrong in 1933, which became a huge box office hit, grossing $3 million against a $200,000 budget, and then nine months later wrote and starred in I'm No Angel. She became such a success that her career saved Paramount from financial ruin.|$|E
