The motion passed with a significant majority of 472 MPs voting in favour and 117 against. The MoD put the cost of building, testing and commissioning the replacement vessels at £31billion (plus a <b>contingency</b> <b>fund</b> of £10billion) over 35 years, or about 0.2percent of government spending, or 6percent of defence spending, every year.

The Dreadnought class will extend the life of the Trident programme until at least the 2060s.|$|E

Consequences: What are the consequences of unfunded requests for the project and for the Funder-Grantee relationship? The survey data lead to five key findings: Disruptions requiring additional <b>funds</b> (i. e., <b>contingency</b> <b>funds)</b> are common and expected. Both Grantees and Funders report that about 1 in 5 projects require <b>contingency</b> <b>funding</b> to bring projects in on time and with full impact.

When <b>contingency</b> <b>funds</b> are needed, most Funders do have the operational and financial capacity to respond. When asked, the majority of Funders do approve additional requests. Grantees are hesitant to communicate with Funders about potential obstacles. Funders' and Grantees' perceptions regarding the effects of their actions on each other are often misaligned. Specifically, grantees believe that asking for additional funds negatively affects the likelihood of being awarded future grants, while the vast majority of Funders claim such requests have no effect on future decision-making...|$|R
