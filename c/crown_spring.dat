He served with distinction, and as part of the Plantation of Munster he was granted over 3,000 acres of land in County Kerry in 1578. His land {{increased}} to approximately 6,000 acres when, on 12 December 1588, he was granted the estates of Killagha Abbey, which had been seized by The Crown during the dissolution of the monasteries. Spring was instructed to rebuild the abbey in a castle-like manner, so that it could serve as a defensive structure. He also became constable of the castle over the River Maine, with responsibility for maintaining English royal authority over the locality. He was accorded the right to hold several country fairs as a source of income and was in control of collecting tolls and taxes for the <b>Crown.</b> <b>Spring</b> served as High Sheriff of Kerry in 1592.

To provide further insight into the flowering responses of long day strawberries to nitrogen, ‘Elan’ seedlings were fertilized in mid-October, overwintered in a greenhouse, then dissected the following March and their floral architecture evaluated. Additional plants from fall N treatments were placed under ND and fertilized weekly for four weeks with 100, 400, 800 or 1200 ppm N during greenhouse-forcing under ND and growth monitored until June. Plants were dissected after forcing and their floral architecture evaluated. Fall fertilized plants were significantly more floral than non-fertilized controls before forcing. Some axillary buds of fertilized plants formed floral branch crowns {{but there were no}} floral branch crowns on non-fertilized plants. Precocity was not affected by fall N and 400, 800 or 1200 ppm spring N were equally effective in accelerating flowering (+ 1 week) compared to 100 ppm spring N. Fall N enhanced the number of inflorescences and flowers produced by the primary <b>crown.</b> <b>Spring</b> N enhanced flowering of branch crowns and the total numbers of inflorescences and flowers per plant. Inflorescence production was a qualitative response to N while flower production was quantitative. Architectural models of post-forcing dissected plants provided additional insight. All 100 ppm spring N terminal meristems were floral while 400 and 800 ppm spring N meristems were less floral. All terminal meristems of plants receiving 100 ppm fall N before 1200 ppm spring N were floral but meristems from plants that did not receive fall N before 1200 ppm spring N were much less floral. Branch crown formation was enhanced with elevated (400, 800 or 1200 ppm) spring N and prior fall N enhanced their floral nature...|$|E

Due to the drier growing conditions experienced in the western Prairies over the last decade, these diseases have been increasing in incidence and severity, especially in durum wheat. Root and crown rot can cause significant yield losses in wheat. In western Canada, they are mostly caused by Cochliobolus sativus (Ito & Kurib.) Drechs. ex Dast.

40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that diffusional limitation of photosynthesis, rather than light, determines the distribution of photosynthetic capacity in olive leaves under drought conditions. The crowns of four olive trees growing in an orchard {{were divided into two}} sectors: one sector absorbed most of the radiation early in the morning (MS) while the other absorbed most in the afternoon (AS). When the peak of radiation absorption was higher in MS, air vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was not high enough to provoke stomatal closure. In contrast, peak radiation absorption in AS coincided with the daily peak in VPD. In addition, two soil water treatments were evaluated: irrigated trees (I) and non-irrigated trees (nI). The seasonal evolution of leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange and photosynthetic capacity were measured throughout the tree <b>crowns</b> in <b>spring</b> and summer. Results showed that stomatal conductance was reduced in nI trees in summer as a consequence of soil water stress, which limited their net assimilation rate. Olive leaves displayed isohydric behaviour and no important differences in the diurnal course of leaf water potentials among treatments and sectors were found. Seasonal diffusional limitation of photosynthesis was mainly increased in nI trees, especially as a result of stomatal limitation, although mesophyll conductance (gm) was found to decrease in summer in both treatments and sectors. A positive relationship between leaf nitrogen content with both leaf photosynthetic capacity and the daily integrated quantum flux density was found in spring, but not in summer. The relationship between photosynthetic capacity and gm was curvilinear. Leaf temperature also affected to gm with an optimum temperature at 29 °C. AS showed larger biochemical limitation than MS in August in both treatments. All these suggest that both diffusional limitation and the effect of leaf temperature could be involved in the seasonal reduction of photosynthetic capacity of olive leaves. This work highlights the need for models of plant growth and ecosystem function to incorporate new parameters affecting the distribution of photosynthetic capacity in canopies.

40|$|Production Methods: In New York, both summer-bearing and fall-fruiting red {{raspberries}} are grown. For summer-bearing berries, {{the root}} system is perennial and plants {{are capable of}} living for several years. Their growth habit is to produce vegetative primocanes the first year, that then become flowering and fruiting floricanes the second year, which then die. Each established field will contain both primocanes and floricanes at the same time. Under ideal soil conditions and good cultural maintenance, a planting may remain productive for 10 or more years. Fall-fruiting or "everbearing " red raspberries produce fruits on the growing tips of primocanes. When the primocanes reach {{a certain number of}} nodes of growth, the apical meristem (growing tissue {{at the tip of the}} cane) changes from a vegetative to a reproductive state. Flower bud initiation continues from the top to the bottom of the cane. A raspberry field is established by planting certified, nursery grown rootstock. Plants are set 30 inches apart within rows, 9 to 10 feet between rows, and 1 inch deeper than they were grown in the nursery. The first year planting produces vegetative canes only (primocanes). In the fall, these primocanes are trained to a single trellis wire about 5 ft. from the ground. In mid-summer of the following season, these overwintering canes (now called floricanes) will flower and produce fruit.

40|$|Xanthorrhoea [...] . is in habit one of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} genera of Terra Australis, and gives a peculiar character to the vegetation of that part of the country where it abounds’ Robert Brown (1814). Grasstrees (arborescent Xanthorrhoea, Dasypogon, Kingia), with their crown of long narrow leaves and blackened leafbase-covered trunk (caudex), are a characteristic growth form in the Australian flora. Xanthorrhoea is the most widespread genus, with 28 species that are prominent from heathlands to sclerophyll forests. While leaf production for X. preissii reaches a peak in spring–summer, growth never stops even in the cool winter or dry autumn seasons. Summer rain, accompanied by a rapid rise in leaf water potential, may be sufficient to stimulate leaf production, whereas root growth is confined to the usual wet season. Grasstrees are highly flammable yet rarely succumb to fire: while retained dead leaves may reach 3 ̆e 1000 °C during fire, the temperature 100 mm above the stem apex remains 3 ̆c 60 °C and the roots are insulated completely. Immediately following fire, leaf production from the intact apical meristem is up to six times greater than that at unburnt sites. For X. preissii, pre-fire biomass is restored within 40 weeks; the mass of live leaves remains uniform from thereon, whereas the mass of dead leaves increases steadily. Leaves usually survive for 3 ̆e 2 years. In X. preissii, the post-fire growth flush corresponds to a reduction in starch storage by desmium in the caudex.

Results indicated that the broken width values around the gateways were larger than 1. 5 m, {{and those in the}} roof and high side wall were larger than those in the low side wall, as a whole. The width values had close relationships with the thickness of the coal seam and immediate roof, angle of the coal seam, and depth of the gateways. Furthermore, combined with the plastic zone of numerical models in 3 -Dimensional Distinct Element Code (3 DEC) and the broken width, we obtained the excavation broken zone (EBZ) cross-section diagram for each gateway and determined that the EBZ appeared to have a basically elliptical shape—with the long axis along the seam inclination direction and the short axis along the vertical direction of the rock layer—and that this elliptical shape was only slightly affected by the gateway cross-section shape. It was observed that the failure extent was greater in the seam inclination direction than in the vertical direction of the rock layer. Obviously, the gateways presented asymmetric failure characteristics and implied that an asymmetric support system should be provided when using bolts, cables, and shotcrete combined with steel mesh and steel belts.

Upon the death of Sir William Spring, 4th Baronet in 1735 the Hall and estate, valued at £1,500 a year, were inherited by his sisters, Merolina, wife of Thomas Discipline Esq, and Mary. The smaller dower house of Newe House remained in the Spring family until the mid-19th century. In 1748 the whole Pakenham Hall estate was owned by Thomas Discipline and in 1786 it was sold to Sir Henry Gough, 2nd Baronet, later Baron Calthorpe. The Gough-Calthorpe family demolished the old medieval and Tudor hall and replaced it with a more modern mansion of built of white brick and flint in around 1900. The house on the site is currently owned by Nigel Roy Whitwell Esq.|$|R
