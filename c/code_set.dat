25|$|The {{practice}} of paroling enemy troops began {{thousands of years}} ago, at least {{as early as the}} time of Carthage. Parole allowed the prisoners' captors to avoid the burdens of having to feed and care for them while still avoiding having the prisoners rejoin their old ranks once released; it could also allow the captors to recover their own men in a prisoner exchange. Hugo Grotius, an early international lawyer, favorably discussed prisoner of war parole. During the American Civil War, both the Dix–Hill Cartel and the Lieber <b>Code</b> <b>set</b> out rules regarding prisoner of war parole. Francis Lieber's thoughts on parole later reappeared in the Declaration of Brussels of 1874, the Hague Convention, and the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.|$|E

The situation was much improved, nonetheless, {{because many of}} the faults were down to the machinery of the court rather than the spirit, which Lord Clarendon soon rectified. Upon appointment as Lord Chancellor he immediately published a new issue of the Orders for the Regulation of the Practice of the Court of Chancery. This was based on the <b>code</b> <b>set</b> by the Cromwellian Commissioners, and limited the fees charged by the court and the amount of time they could take on a case.|$|E

Codes serve this role by assigning each distinct service a unique identifier. Health care providers, such as hospitals and physicians, report medical conditions and the health-related services they have provided to patients on medical records. In August 2000, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) adopted two standard <b>code</b> <b>sets</b> for reporting medical procedures: (1) the International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision, Clinical Modification, Volume 3 (ICD- 9 -CM Vol. 3); and (2) the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT). Despite HIPAA's goals for administrative simplification, many representatives {{of the health care}} industry have expressed concern that the individual limitations of these <b>code</b> <b>sets</b> result in inefficiencies in record keeping and data reporting. GAO found that, given the 18 -month time frame allotted to HHS under HIPAA for adopting standard <b>code</b> <b>sets,</b> ICD- 9 -CM Vol. 3 and CPT were practical options for HIPAA standard <b>code</b> <b>sets</b> despite some limitations. Both <b>code</b> <b>sets</b> meet almost all of the criteria for standard <b>code</b> <b>sets</b> recommended by HHS's HIPAA implementation teams. For example, they improve the efficiency and {{meet the needs of the}} health care industry, have low additional costs and administrative burdens associated with their implementation, and are consistent with other HIPAA standards. In addition, each of these <b>codes</b> <b>sets</b> meets a criterion for procedural <b>code</b> <b>sets</b> recommended by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics. ...|$|R
