5000|$|The {{allocation}} routine {{may be more}} complicated, and slower.

50|$|More modern garbage <b>collection</b> <b>schemes</b> {{are often}} based on a notion of {{reachability}} - if you don't have a usable reference to the memory in question, it can be collected. Other garbage <b>collection</b> <b>schemes</b> can be based on reference counting, where an object is responsible for keeping track of how many references are pointing to it. If the number goes down to zero, the object is expected to release itself and allow its memory to be reclaimed. The flaw with this model is that it doesn't cope with cyclic references, {{and this is why}} nowadays most programmers are prepared to accept the burden of the more costly mark and sweep type of systems.|$|E
50|$|Peter Aczel's {{constructive}} Zermelo-Fraenkel, or CZF, {{is essentially}} IZF with its impredicative features removed. It strengthens the <b>collection</b> <b>scheme,</b> and then drops the impredicative power set axiom and replaces {{it with another}} <b>collection</b> <b>scheme.</b> Finally the separation axiom is restricted, as in Myhill's CST. This theory has a relatively simple interpretation in a version of constructive type theory and has modest proof theoretic strength {{as well as a}} fairly direct constructive and predicative justification, while retaining the language of set theory. Adding LEM to this theory also recovers full ZF.|$|R
40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a general garbage <b>collection</b> <b>scheme</b> that reduces the “noise ” in gossip-based {{broadcast}} algorithms. In short, our garbage <b>collection</b> <b>scheme</b> uses a simple heuristic to trade “useless ” messages with “use-ful ” ones. Used with a given gossip-based broadcast algo-rithm, a given size of buffers, and a given number of dis-seminated messages (e. g., per gossip round), our garbage <b>collection</b> <b>scheme</b> provides higher overall reliability than more conventional schemes. We illustrate our approach through two algorithms: Bimodal Multicast (pbcast) [1] and Lightweight Probabilistic Broadcast (lpbcast) [5]. Our scheme {{is based on the}} intuitive idea of discard-ing messages according to their “age”. The “age ” of a message represents the number of times the message has been retransmitted. Roughly speaking, if you have to choose among a set of jokes to memorize, you might probably not choose the one you have heard the most often: it is very likely that there will be someone in your audience to already know this joke. ...|$|R

This paper compares the environmental and social impacts of a kerbside <b>collection</b> <b>scheme</b> for recyclable household waste, with a bring scheme, using lifecycle assessment. Economic valuation is used to assign relative weights to these impacts. A second comparison examines the relative external costs of recycling and landfill disposal of waste. The {{results show that the}} kerbside <b>collection</b> <b>scheme</b> has a lower external cost than the bring scheme, but this is of less importance than the benefits to be gained within the manufacturing system by using secondary materials. It is concluded that the combination of lifecycle assessment and economic valuation is an effective means of evaluation to direct the sustainable development of waste management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A typical task in a {{wireless}} sensor network is that every sensor node senses its local environment and, upon request, sends the data of interest back to a base station. Based on this many-to-one communication pattern, we first propose a dis-tributed N-to- 1 multipath discovery protocol which distinguishes from other multipath routing protocols {{in that it is}} able to find multiple node-disjoint paths from every sensor node to the base station simultaneously in one route discovery process. Then we propose a hybrid multipath data <b>collection</b> <b>scheme</b> which combines end-to-end multipath traffic dispersion and per-hop alternate path salvaging. Our simulation results show that the proposed N-to- 1 multipath discovery protocol is highly efficient and the hybrid data <b>collection</b> <b>scheme</b> based on it provides a seamlessly more reliable and more secure data collection service in {{wireless sensor network}}s.
