5|$|Although Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh remain <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pre-1956 {{history of}} the Priory of Sion is true, they confess to the {{possibility}} that all of Plantard's claims about a post-1956 Priory of Sion were part of an elaborate hoax to build a cult of personality and cult of intelligence around himself in French esoteric circles.|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of being}} sobered by their 3,000 casualties, Archduke John {{and his staff}} became <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> enemy was on the run. The Austrian general ordered a pursuit of the French through forested terrain. But, instead of fleeing, Moreau and his troops {{were waiting for the}} Austrians. The two armies met in the decisive Battle of Hohenlinden two days later.|$|E

5|$|The {{executives}} of Columbia Records were not <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> album would sell well, because {{the project was}} {{a radical departure from}} his earlier success in the outlaw movement. The album included pop, jazz and folk music styles, in addition to country. It was recorded from December 3–12, 1977.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} Graffham was minimal. The Swedish {{government}} agreed to {{few of the}} concessions requested during the meetings, and few high-level officials were <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Allies would invade Norway. Overall, the influence of Graffham and Fortitude North on German strategy in Scandinavia is disputed.|$|E
5|$|Upon reading Pike's journal, Hill became <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Kansas site {{could not}} be the correct one.

5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{company had been}} treated wrongly and insisted in {{bringing}} it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced {{the rest of the}} board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent.|$|E
5|$|After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, {{during which}} Bizet {{served in the}} National Guard, he had little success with his one-act opera Djamileh, though an orchestral suite derived from his {{incidental}} music to Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne was instantly popular. The production of Bizet's final opera, Carmen, was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences. After its premiere on 3 March 1875, Bizet was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> work was a failure; {{he died of a}} heart attack three months later, unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success.|$|E
5|$|Although the UN aerial {{reconnaissance}} observed on November 27 that the Chinese {{forces on the}} UN right flank were moving rapidly into the Eighth Army's rear, Walker still ordered {{the rest of the}} Eighth Army to continue the offensive north. <b>Convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> collapse of the ROK II Corps was merely a small counterattack by the Chinese, Walker ordered the US I and IX Corps to shift eastward in order to cover the ROK II Corps' sector. By that time, however, the US I and IX Corps had already suffered heavy losses from the Chinese counteroffensive at Kujang-dong, Ipsok and Yongsan-dong.|$|E

5|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} radical in his progressivism, Taft was {{hardened}} in his resolve to achieve re-nomination, {{as he was}} <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> progressives threatened the very foundation of the government. One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt, {{one of the last}} links between the previous and present presidents, as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt. Ambivalent between his loyalties, Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking, a death Taft found hard to accept as his body was not recovered.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{manifesto}} was published, the FBI held many {{press conferences}} asking {{the public to}} help identify the Unabomber.

This geographical information, as well as the wording in excerpts from the manifesto that were released before the entire manifesto was published, persuaded David Kaczynski's wife, Linda, to urge her husband to read the manifesto.|$|E

5|$|By 1799, the {{fortress}} of Mantua {{on the river}} Mincio in northern Italy was in poor shape. It was commanded by viscount lieutenant general François-Philippe de Foissac-Latour (1750-1804) and garrisoned by a diverse force of 10,000, including French, Polish (Polish Legionnaires under general Józef Wielhorski), Italian (Republic of Alba and Cisalpine Republic), Swiss and German units. From {{the beginning of his}} assignment, Foissac-Latour, an engineer, was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fortress would be indefensible in any serious siege.|$|E
5|$|Ciudad Juárez, {{defended by}} 700 troops, was {{surrounded}} on three sides, {{with the only}} possible exit route for the besieged federales being the northern path into El Paso and the US. Despite {{the fact that the}} revolutionaries had cut off the water supplies into town and the garrison was low on ammunition, its commander, Gen. Juan N.

5|$|Eventually, in July 1864, Saraiva's {{persistent}} diplomacy {{moved the}} Uruguayan government {{to agree to}} mediated talks including Edward Thornton (the British resident minister in Buenos Aires), Argentine foreign minister Rufino de Elizalde and Saraiva himself. Initially, the negotiations seemed promising, but soon bogged down. On 4 August, <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government in Montevideo was unwilling to work toward a settlement, a frustrated Saraiva delivered an ultimatum, which the Uruguayans rebuffed. On 10 August, Saraiva informed Aguirre that the Brazilian military commanders would receive orders to begin retaliation, marking {{the beginning of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Other factors {{contributed to}} the rising {{tensions}} as well. On his way to Egypt in 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and forcibly removed the Hospitallers from their possessions. This angered Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. The French Directory, furthermore, was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians and the English actually discussed this possibility.|$|E

However, Thunderbird 6 received a similarly unenthusiastic response on its release in 1968, and the Thunderbirds franchise was abandoned until the appearance of a reboot, starring live actors, in 2004. Meanwhile, the Zero-X astronauts were featured in their own strip in the Anderson-related TV Century 21 comic until 1969, and the MEV portion of the spacecraft appeared in the pilot episode of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.|$|E
