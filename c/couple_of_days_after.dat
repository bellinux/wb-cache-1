40|$|Background- Noninvasive {{methods for}} {{identification}} of accessory pathway(s) (AP) location in pre-excitation syndrome {{have always been}} desirable. Given the non-invasiveness and other advantages of radionuclide ventriculography (RVG), this study was performed to verify the efficacy of RVG in determining the location of accessory pathway(s) in patients with Wolff-Parkinson –White (WPW) syndrome. Methods- Fourteen patients with WPW syndrome were enrolled {{in this study and}} they underwent RVG scanning followed by electrophysiologic study (EPS) within a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days.</b> Results- <b>After</b> we compared the scintigraphic and electrophysiologic results, RVG showed that 11 patients had one AP and 3 patients had dual APs.

Considering the location of APs, RVG identified their location (in comparison with EPS) in 78. 8 % of the patients. (Iranian Heart Journal. 2002...|$|R

500|$|The idea of {{combining}} motion pictures with recorded sound {{is nearly as}} old as the concept of cinema itself. On February 27, 1888, a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge gave a lecture not far from the laboratory of Thomas Edison, the two inventors privately met. Muybridge later claimed that on this occasion, six years before the first commercial motion picture exhibition, he proposed a scheme for sound cinema that would combine his image-casting zoopraxiscope with Edison's recorded-sound technology. No agreement was reached, but within a year Edison commissioned the development of the Kinetoscope, essentially a [...] "peep-show" [...] system, as a visual complement to his cylinder phonograph. The two devices were brought together as the Kinetophone in 1895, but individual, cabinet viewing of motion pictures was soon to be outmoded by successes in film projection. In 1899, a projected sound-film system known as Cinemacrophonograph or Phonorama, based primarily on the work of Swiss-born inventor François Dussaud, was exhibited in Paris; similar to the Kinetophone, the system required individual use of earphones. An improved cylinder-based system, Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre, was developed by Clément-Maurice Gratioulet and Henri Lioret of France, allowing short films of theater, opera, and ballet excerpts to be presented at the Paris Exposition in 1900. These appear to be the first publicly exhibited films with projection of both image and recorded sound. Phonorama and yet another sound-film system—Théâtroscope—were also presented at the Exposition.|$|E
