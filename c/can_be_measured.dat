5|$|Charge <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> by {{a number}} of means, an early {{instrument}} being the gold-leaf electroscope, which although still in use for classroom demonstrations, has been superseded by the electronic electrometer.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{problems}} can be solved using this result. For example, consider two measuring cups of volume a and b. By adding/subtracting u multiples of the first cup and v multiples of the second cup, any volume ua + vb <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> out. These volumes are all multiples of g = gcd(a, b).|$|E
5|$|Differences {{in brain}} {{structure}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> in some disorders, notably schizophrenia and dementia. Different biological approaches using imaging have given more insight for example into the disorders {{of depression and}} obsessive-compulsive disorder. A key {{source of information about}} the function of brain regions is the effects of damage to them.|$|E

25|$|Aerosol <b>can</b> either <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> in-situ or with {{remote sensing}} techniques.|$|R
50|$|Electric current <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{directly}} <b>measured</b> with a galvanometer, {{but this}} method involves breaking the electrical circuit, which is sometimes inconvenient. Current <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> {{without breaking the}} circuit by detecting the magnetic field associated with the current. Devices used for this include Hall effect sensors, current clamps, current transformers, and Rogowski coils.|$|R
5|$|Dysprosium {{is used in}} {{dosimeters}} {{for measuring}} ionizing radiation. Crystals of calcium sulfate or calcium fluoride are doped with dysprosium. When these crystals are exposed to radiation, the dysprosium atoms become excited and luminescent. The luminescence <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> to determine the degree of exposure to which the dosimeter has been subjected.|$|E
5|$|Stellar {{rotation}} is {{the angular}} motion {{of a star}} about its axis. The rate of rotation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> from the spectrum of the star, or by timing the movements of active features on the surface.|$|E
5|$|A {{theodolite}} can {{be considerably}} more accurate if used correctly, {{but it is}} also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> with a theodolite or a clinometer.|$|E
5000|$|Potential {{for fraud}} (battery quality <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> over a full {{discharge}} cycle; battery lifetime <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> over repeated discharge cycles; {{those in the}} swap transaction cannot know if they are getting a worn or reduced effectiveness battery; battery quality degrades slowly over time, so worn batteries will be gradually forced into the system) ...|$|R

5|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} {{with normal}} water {{cannot be used}} for 1H NMR measurements but heavy water, D2O, must be used instead. 13C NMR data, however, {{can be used with}} normal water and 1H NMR spectra can be used with non-aqueous media. The quantities measured with NMR are time-averaged chemical shifts, as proton exchange is fast on the NMR time-scale. Other chemical shifts, such as those of 31P <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> in the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E
5|$|For TSH, basal {{measurements}} are usually sufficient, {{as well as}} measurements of thyroxine {{to ensure that the}} pituitary is not simply suppressing TSH production in response to hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland). A stimulation test with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is not regarded as useful. Prolactin <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> by basal level, and is required for the interpretation of LH and FSH results in addition to the confirmation of hypopituitarism or diagnosis of a prolactin-secreting tumor.|$|E

5|$|In the laboratory, the {{strength}} of this interaction <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their melting temperature (also called Tm value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.|$|E
5|$|Innovation management: The {{value of}} the {{coordinating}} role of design in new product development has been well documented. Design management can help to improve innovation management, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.|$|E
5|$|Pendant drop method: Surface and {{interfacial}} tension <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> by this technique, even at elevated temperatures and pressures. Geometry of a drop is analyzed optically. For pendant drops the maximum diameter and the ratio between this parameter and the diameter at {{the distance of}} the maximum diameter from the drop apex has been used to evaluate the size and shape parameters in order to determine surface tension.|$|E

5|$|Silicon carbide fibers {{are used}} to measure gas {{temperatures}} in an optical technique called thin filament pyrometry. It involves the placement of a thin filament in a hot gas stream. Radiative emissions from the filament can be correlated with filament temperature. Filaments are SiC fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometers, about one fifth that of a human hair. Because the fibers are so thin, they do little to disturb the flame and their temperature remains close {{to that of the}} local gas. Temperatures of about 800–2500 K <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured.</b>|$|E
5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> during a {{neurological}} examination to assess {{function of the}} spinal accessory nerve. Poor strength or limited movement are suggestive of damage, which can result {{from a variety of}} causes. Injury to the spinal accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E
5|$|Surge <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> {{directly}} at coastal tidal stations as {{the difference between}} the forecast tide and the observed rise of water. Another method of measuring surge is by the deployment of pressure transducers along the coastline just ahead of an approaching tropical cyclone. This was first tested for Hurricane Rita in 2005. These types of sensors can be placed in locations that will be submerged and can accurately measure the height of water above them.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of the distance and proper motion of this system {{can be used to}} compute the transverse velocity of IK Pegasi as 16.9 km/s. The third component, the heliocentric radial velocity, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> by the average red-shift (or blue-shift) of the stellar spectrum. The General Catalogue of Stellar Radial Velocities lists a radial velocity of -11.4 km/s for this system. The {{combination of}} these two motions gives a space velocity of 20.4 km/s relative to the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to the IK Pegasi system <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> directly by observing the tiny parallax shifts of this system (against the more distant stellar background) as the Earth orbits around the Sun. This shift was measured to high precision by the Hipparcos spacecraft, yielding a distance estimate of 150 light years (with an accuracy of ±5 light years). The same spacecraft also measured the proper motion of this system. This is the small angular motion of IK Pegasi across the sky because of its motion through space.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclination}} {{is given}} by an angle that can assume values between -90° (up) to 90° (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the North Magnetic Pole and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0°) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> with a dip circle.|$|E
