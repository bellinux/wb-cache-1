25|$|What {{disturbs}} Delano are incidents {{he observes}} among the hatchet polishers, oakum pickers, {{such as when}} a black boy stabs a white one. Apparently Cereno does not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> behavior, not even when Atufal, a regal-looking slave appears in chains but still refusing to humble himself. The whispering between Cereno and Babo makes Delano feel uncomfortable. Gradually his suspicions increase, as he notes Cereno's sudden waves of dizziness and anxiety, the crew's awkward movements and whisperings, and the unusual interaction of the slaves and the whites. Yet Delano answers Cereno’s questions about the crew, cargo, and arms aboard the Bachelor’s Delight without reserve, reasoning that the innocent are protected by the truth. When The Rover arrives with the supplies, Delano sends her back for more water while he continues to observe curious incidents.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film two stars {{out of four}} and asked about the title character, [...] "Why should I <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> guy? He feels no pain and nothing can kill him, so {{therefore}} he's essentially a story device for action sequences." [...] James Berardinelli gave Wolverine {{two and a half}} stars out of four, calling the action scenes competently executed but not memorable, and considering that when dealing with Wolverine's past [...] "there's little creativity evident in the way those blanks are filled in", and that the revelations made Wolverine [...] "less compelling". Comparatively, Bill Gibron of AMC's Filmcritic.com website gave the film a positive [...] "4.0 out of 5 stars," [...] saying that although Hugh Jackman is [...] "capable of carrying even the most mediocre effort, he singlehandedly makes X-Men Origins: Wolverine an excellent start to the summer 2009 season." [...] He predicted [...] "there will be purists who balk at how Hood and his screenwriters mangle and manipulate the mythology;" [...] and further said that [...] "any ending which leaves several characters unexplained and unaccounted for can't really seal the full entertainment deal." ...|$|E
500|$|Jericho Cross (voiced by Christopher Corey Smith): The {{protagonist of}} the game, a jaded American Civil War deserter and drifter {{who became a}} gunslinger and train robber. During his [...] "one last job", he {{releases}} Lazarus Malkoth from his prison in a failed attempt to steal the contents. While dueling with Lazarus, Jericho gets bitten and infected by the vampire curse. His already deadly skills are enhanced by his vampire powers that afford him superhuman strength, increased endurance, enhanced agility, and heightened senses, {{in the form of}} the bioluminescent red orb that regenerated from his empty eye socket. Shadow is Jericho's demonic horse that appears at his beckon. According to the developers, they created [...] "deep psychological profiles of every character in the game" [...] with [...] "hope that Jericho's character arc — as this desperate [...] that's robbing trains with a subconscious death wish — makes a believable transition into this half-vampire hybrid gunslinger and will ultimately envelop the player in his destiny: which is a guy that can be either a hero or a terror. Basically, we just want people to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> character and what happens to him — and I can't think of a first-person shooter that's really made us do that yet." ...|$|E

500|$|Taylor cabled Washington to say [...] "I {{can well}} {{visualize}} [...] necessity {{at some time}} of using full U.S. leverage ... to induce our Vietnamese friends to get Khánh out of [...] position of commander-in-chief (from which he pulls the strings) and to install their very best governmental line-up." [...] He also told his State Department superiors that Khánh was very likely aware of his machinations, but {{that he did not}} <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> At the same time, there was also the question of finding another military-appointed prime minister to replace Hương. Taylor wanted Nguyen Luu Vien, Huong's deputy, to take over, and advised South Vietnamese officers who were on good terms with him to try to engineer this, but they were not able to get enough support. Eventually, Phan Huy Quát was appointed prime minister on February 14. Quát was a moderate Buddhist not associated with the political demonstrators, and seen as a compromise candidate who would be acceptable across the religious spectrum, albeit grudgingly. He was also regarded as being favorable to Khánh, who would not be around {{for more than a few}} more days to support, control or pressure him in any case. All the while, intelligence reports of Khánh's attempted dealings with the communists increased.|$|E

2500|$|Ruskin lectured {{widely in}} the 1860s, giving the Rede lecture at the University of Cambridge in 1867, for example. He {{spoke at the}} British Institution on 'Modern Art', the Working Men's Institute, Camberwell on [...] "Work" [...] and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich on 'War'. Ruskin's widely admired lecture, Traffic, on the {{relations}} of taste and morality, was delivered in April 1864 at Bradford Town Hall, {{to which he had}} been invited because of a local debate about the style of a new Exchange building. [...] "I do not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Exchange," [...] Ruskin told his audience, [...] "because you don't!" [...] These last three lectures were published in The Crown of Wild Olive (1866).|$|E

2500|$|Obama {{communications}} aide Robert Gibbs, who {{had worked}} for Kerry's campaign, recommended Favreau to Obama as an excellent writer, and in 2005 he began working for Barack Obama in his United States Senate office, before joining Obama's presidential campaign as chief speechwriter in 2006. His interview with Obama was on the Senator's first day. Uninterested in Favreau's résumé, Obama instead questioned Favreau on what motivated him to work in politics, and what his theory of writing was. He described this theory to Obama as, [...] "A speech can broaden the circle of people who <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> stuff. How {{do you say to the}} average person that's been hurting: 'I hear you, I'm there?'

2500|$|In Games Workshop's {{tabletop}} game [...] "The Horus Heresy" [...] the Emperor's Children Space Marine legion {{is described}} as having a gene-seed defect that results in an [...] "occasional incidence of albinism, and a shift in iris colour to violet in some recruits." [...] The Emperor's Children are initially depicted as being obsessed with achieving personal perfection in all ways, though they seemed not to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> defect. They were the only legion allowed to bear the Emperor's name, and the only legion allowed to bear his personal standard, the [...] "Palatine Aquila." [...] However, they were {{also one of the}} legions which betrayed the Imperium during the Horus heresy event. Whether or not this makes them evil is entire subjective, as arguments can be made for both the Imperium and the Traitor Legions being good or evil. It is unknown whether this gene-seed defect still exists in Warhammer 40,000 (of which the Horus Heresy is a spin-off game.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{this early}} {{attempt at a}} major long novel, DeLillo ended the decade with two shorter works. Players (1977), {{originally}} conceived as being [...] "based on {{what could be called}} the intimacy of language. What people who live together really sound like," [...] concerned the lives of a young yuppie couple as the husband gets involved with a cell of domestic terrorists. Its 1978 successor, Running Dog (1978), written in a brief four-month streak of writing, was a thriller concerning numerous individuals hunting down a celluloid reel of Hitler's sexual exploits. Of Running Dog, DeLillo remarked in his Rolling Stone interview that [...] "What I was really getting at in Running Dog was a sense of the terrible acquisitiveness in which we live, coupled with a final indifference to the object. After all the mad attempts to acquire the thing, everyone suddenly decides that, well, maybe we really don't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> so much anyway. This was something I felt characterized our lives at the time the book was written, in the mid to late seventies. I think this was part of American consciousness then." ...|$|E

Jeffrey Toobin of CNN and The New Yorker, a Harvard classmate, has said: [...] "I’m not surprised to see him emerge as the moral conscience of our generation of journalists. I am surprised {{to see him as}} the Indiana Jones of our generation of journalists.”Bill Clinton said in September 2009: [...] "There is no one in journalism, anywhere in the United States at least, who has done anything like the work he has done to figure out how poor people are actually living around the world, and what their potential is....So every American citizen who <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> should be profoundly grateful that someone in our press establishment <b>cares</b> enough <b>about</b> <b>this</b> to haul himself all around the world to figure out whats going on....I am personally in his debt, as are we all." ...|$|R

If--if anything had happened to you, I couldn't have fought on, but now that you're here with me again, now that you've risked your life and almost lost it for this--this new order in which you believe, why, it's enough for me--I can surrender with honour. I'm tired, I need a rest. I'd have gone down fighting, but I guess you've saved me. I've been true to my convictions,--you, who belong to the new generation, must be true to yours.
