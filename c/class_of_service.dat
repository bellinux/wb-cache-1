40|$|Abstract. A {{service is}} controllable, if {{there exists a}} service with which it can {{interact}} properly. We sketch an approach to decide controllability for a certain <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> Controllability is decided by synthesizing a service that controls the given <b>service.</b> For a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> which abstracts from data, the synthesis problem is already solved. In this paper, we present an approach for a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> that deals with data explicitly. ...|$|R

40|$|The Web Service Offerings Language (WSOL) {{is a novel}} {{language}} for the formal specification <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> various types <b>of</b> constraint, and management statements for Web Services. Compared with recent competing works, WSOL has several unique characteristics. One {{of them is a}} diverse set of reusability constructs: definition <b>of</b> <b>service</b> offerings, definition <b>of</b> constraint groups, definition and instantiation of constraint group templates, extension, inclusion, specification of applicability domains, and declaration of operation calls. These constructs enable sharing parts of WSOL specifications between <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> different Web <b>Services</b> and development <b>of</b> libraries of reusable WSOL specifications. Consequently, they can help in alleviating heterogeneity <b>of</b> Web <b>Services.</b> In addition, reusability constructs are useful for easier development of new WSOL specifications from existing ones, for easier selection <b>of</b> Web <b>Services</b> and their <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> and for dynamic (run-time) adaptation of relationships between provider and consumer Web <b>Services.</b> An integration <b>of</b> WSOL reusability constructs into the works competing with WSOL would be beneficial...|$|R

An invitation-only card called Club 2000 is attributed to some VIPs, celebrities and politicians.

40|$|We {{research}} dynamic reconfiguration of component {{systems in}} the context of dynamic adaptation. We classify various approaches to dynamic adaptation of component composition and conclude that they differ in power and complexity, yet still have significantly compatible strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, we argue for an integrated approach that implements several different approaches and leverages their compatible benefits by applying the appropriate one in a given situation. In the remainder of the paper we show how our recent research fits into this framework. This research is concentrated on Web Services as a specific type of distributed components. We explore Web <b>Services</b> with multiple <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and dynamic adaptation <b>of</b> Web <b>Service</b> compositions using manipulation <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Such an approach to dynamic adaptation is complementary to the reconfiguration of compositions <b>of</b> Web <b>Services</b> done by finding alternative Web Services and rebinding. Its benefits include adaptation speed, enhanced robustness of the relationships between components, simplicity, and low overhead. Also, providing multiple <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> at the Web Service level has other benefits such as increased flexibility and choice for both Web Service vendors and consumers, while maintaining relatively low overhead and limited complexity of required management...|$|R
