40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{widespread}} {{application of}} hydrogels {{in a number}} of applications like control of microfluidic flow, development of muscle-like actuators, filtration/separation and drug delivery makes it important to properly understand these materials. Understanding hydrogel properties is also important from the standpoint of their similarity to many biological tissues. The degree of swelling as well as the rate of swelling of the hydrogel was studied through experiments using digital photography. First of all the matrix was prepared by blending properly weighed HPMC, Theophylline and excipients in a laboratory mixture for 10 minutes followed by compression with 5 ton force for 30 seconds. The study was designed to evaluate the effect of hydrophobic materials on HPMC matrix tablets in terms of in vitro swelling study. Different viscosity grades of HPMC i. e. 6 - cps, 15 -cps and 50 -cps were used to prepare tablets along with various hydrophobic materials. Among the hydrophobic materials stearic acid (SA), cetyl alcohol (CA), bees wax (BW), glyceryl monostearate (GMS), <b>cetostearyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (CSA) and stearyl alcohol (STA) were used. It was found that presence of hydrophobic ingredients in the HPMC hydrogel matrix substantially reduces swelling of the matrix. In this work, the extent of swelling of HPMC matrix was evaluated by using digital photography and counting the pixels with Photoshop software. Finally, it was shown from the experiment that the rate and extent of drug release is mainly governed by swelling rate of different HPMC viscosity grade used and the nature of hydrophobic materials included into the matrix system...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Drug release {{profiles}} {{were established}} for ibuprofen encapsulated within {{several types of}} microspheres {{and a range of}} dissolution buffer media to study the effect these variables have in controlling the rate and extent of drug release. METHODS: Fatty acid microspheres containing ibuprofen were prepared by a process previously developed and refined to produce microspheres of a known size and composition, namely 80 - 125 ?m diameter and an excipient to ibuprofen ratio of 3 : 1. Drug release profiles from these encapsulated formulations were compared with those obtained for the dissolution of ibuprofen alone under the same conditions. RESULTS: Stearic acid microspheres were found to only partially retard the release of ibuprofen over a twenty minute period compared with the dissolution of ibuprofen alone. However, a significant retardation of ibuprofen release was observed with <b>cetostearyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> microspheres over the same period of time. Secondly, drug release profiles for encapsulated ibuprofen were determined using five distinct dissolution buffer media; sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, citric acid and phosphate mix, MOPS and tris. Significant differences in the extent and rate of drug release were recorded between the different dissolution buffer solutions. These differences were also shown to be independent of variations in pH, temperature, buffer concentrations and the type of cations present. CONCLUSIONS: The presence and choice of microsphere formulation, and the choice of buffer present in the dissolution solution, can influence drug release in vitro, i. e. it is possible to achieve controlled drug release from microspheres. To explain the control achieved through the choice of buffer in solution it is proposed that the buffer anion exerts a stabilising influence on the ibuprofen-microsphere matri...|$|E

40|$|Introdução: A xerose senil (pele seca) é muito comum em pessoas idosas. Além de causar desconforto, predispõe a diferentes desordens dermatológicas. As emulsões cosméticas são usadas para prevenir e tratar a pele seca. No entanto, não se sabe ainda se o efeito hidratante dos diferentes produtos disponíveis é semelhante em jovens e idosos. Objetivo: Desenvolver emulsões cosméticas, avaliar suas características físico-químicas e comparar suas eficácias de hidratação cutânea em mulheres jovens e idosas, através de métodos biofísicos. Materiais e Métodos: Foram desenvolvidas duas emulsões cosméticas com sistemas de emulsionantes distintos, denominadas emulsão NI (álcool cetoestearílico 20 OE e álcool oleílico etoxilado 3 OE) e emulsão CL (lecitina), contendo os mesmos emolientes (álcoois de lanolina, óleo de prímula, óleo de amêndoas, oleato de isodecila, vaselina). Nas emulsões desenvolvidas, foram determinados pH, espalhabilidade, viscosidade, estabilidade e presença de cristais líquidos na estrutura. Na emulsão NI adicionou-se uréia 2 %, lactato de amônio 2 %, ácido pirrolidônico carboxílico 2 %, isomerato de sacarídio 2 % e ácido hialurônico 2 % (emulsão NIA). Como amostra comparativa foi empregada a emulsão MEG que é usada com excipiente em produtos dermatológicos para pele seca. O efeito hidratante das emulsões foi avaliado por meio de ensaio clínico de curta duração, sendo quantificado duas horas após a aplicação do produto por espectroscopia com atenuação de refletância (FTIR-ATR) ou FTIR-ATR e capacitância. As emulsões NI, CL e MEG foram testadas em 49 mulheres (20 ± 2 anos) e em 30 mulheres (70 ± 7 anos). As emulsões NI, NIA e MEG foram testadas em 50 mulheres (22 ± 2 anos) e as emulsões NI e NIA em 17 mulheres (70 ± 4 anos). Resultados e Discussão: As duas emulsões desenvolvidas NI e CL foram estáveis e apresentaram cristais líquidos em sua estrutura. A emulsão NI apresentou as melhores características reológicas, com menor ponto de fluidez e melhor espalhabilidade. O efeito hidratante das emulsões NI, CL e MEG em mulheres jovens, testado por FTIR-ATR, demonstrou que as emulsões NI e CL hidrataram significativamente mais do que a MEG, sendo que o efeito hidratante da NI foi maior que o da emulsão MEG, independentemente da faixa etária testada. No entanto, a hidratação foi significativamente maior em mulheres jovens do que em idosas. A emulsão NIA hidratou significativamente mais a pele de mulheres jovens do que a emulsão NI e significativamente mais a pele de mulheres jovens do que de idosas. Todavia, não houve diferença de hidratação entre as emulsões NI e NIA em idosas. Os métodos empregados para avaliar a hidratação cutânea, FTIR-ATR e capacitância, apresentaram boa correlação de seus resultados. Os resultados obtidos neste estudo demonstram, com clareza, a necessidade de se desenvolverem produtos especiais para pele de pessoas idosas e comprovar a sua eficácia nessa população. Introduction: Senile xerosis (age-related dry skin) is {{very common}} in elderly people. Besides causing discomfort, it predisposes elderlies to {{different}} skin disorders. Cosmetic emulsions are used to prevent and treat dry skin. However, it is still unknown whether the hydrating effect of the different products available is similar in young and elderly people. Objective: To develop cosmetic emulsions, to evaluate their physico-chemical properties and to compare their cutaneous hydration effect in young and old women, through biophysical methods. Materials and Methods: Two cosmetic emulsions were developed with different emulsifying systems, called NI emulsion (<b>cetostearyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> 20 OE, oleyl alcohol 3 OE) and CL emulsion (lecithin), containing the same emollient (lanolin alcohols, evening primrose oil, almond oil, isodecyl oleate, vaseline). In the emulsions developed, pH, spreadability, viscosity, stability and presence of liquid crystals in the structure were determined. In the NI emulsion, urea 2 %, ammonium lactate 2 %, pyrrolidone carboxylic. The emulsion MEG, dermatological vehicle for products for dry skin, was used as comparative sample. The hydrating effect of the emulsions was evaluated through a short-term clinical trial, quantified two hours after {{the application of the}} product through attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) or FTIR-ATR and capacitance. The NI, CL and MEG emulsions were tested in 49 women (aged 20 ± 2 years) and in 30 women (aged 70 ± years). The NI, NIA and MEG emulsions were tested in 50 women (aged 22 ± 2 years) and the NI and NIA emulsions in 17 women (aged 70 ± 4 years). Results and Discussion: both NI and CL emulsions developed were stable and presented liquid crystals in their structure. The NI emulsion presented the best rheological characteristics, with a lower pour point and better spreadability. The hydrating effect of the NI, CL and MEG emulsions in young women, tested by FTIRATR, showed that the NI and CL emulsions hydrated significantly better than the MEG one; besides, NI’s hydrating effect was higher than that of the MEG emulsion, independently from the age bracket tested. However, hydration was significantly higher in younger women than in elderly ones. The NIA emulsion hydrated the skin of young women significantly more than the NI emulsion, as well as hydrated the skin of younger women considerably more than that of elderly women. Nevertheless, there was no difference of hydration between NI and NIA emulsions in elderly women. The methods employed to evaluate skin hydration, FTIR-ATR and capacitance, showed good correlation between results. The results obtained in this work clearly demonstrated the necessity of developing new special products for the skin of elderly people and proving its efficiency in this population...|$|E
