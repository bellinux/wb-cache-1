5|$|The canopy hinges open to {{the right}} and the pilot enters using the flip-down ladder. Once inside, the pilot sits low in the <b>cockpit,</b> {{protected}} by the bathtub assembly, which makes for a cramped <b>cockpit.</b> Visibility from the <b>cockpit</b> is limited, being a trade-off for improved pilot protection. Rearwards visibility is poor, though a periscope is fitted on top of the canopy to compensate.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} contained {{two major}} bulkheads, with the <b>cockpit</b> {{at the front}} of the first bulkhead. The nose was fitted with a rotating machine gun mount, offset to allow the pilot a better field of forward vision. The <b>cockpit</b> was fully glazed, with the exception of the lower right section, which acted as a platform for the bombardier-gunner. The commonly-used Lotfernrohr-series bombsight penetrated through the <b>cockpit</b> floor into a protective housing on the external side of the <b>cockpit.</b>|$|E

50|$|First {{flown in}} 1935, {{it was a}} low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane of wooden construction, with tandem open <b>cockpits</b> and fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The aircraft proved popular with Czechoslovakia's aeroclubs and was successful in international competitions. In 1937, the designers created a modernised version, the Be-51, which featured a reduced wingspan and fully enclosed <b>cockpits.</b> A final variant, the Be-52 Beta-Major retained the Be-50's open <b>cockpits</b> but featured improved aerodynamics and a more powerful Walter Major engine.|$|R
5|$|An {{airtight}} {{avionics compartment}} {{is behind the}} <b>cockpit</b> {{and in front of}} the forward fuel tank.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} found several shortcomings in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper <b>cockpit</b> communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent and approach plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow the Sterile <b>Cockpit</b> Rule and that a passenger {{was sitting in a}} <b>cockpit</b> jump seat during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cockpit</b> {{preserved}} in Burnham on Sea, Somerset, England.|$|E
25|$|Two pilots {{occupied}} separate <b>cockpits</b> {{either side}} of the fuselage, while a bombardier sat in the nose. One or two flight engineers sat behind the <b>cockpits</b> to help tend the engines. A radio operator and a navigator were seated next to them.|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} AIR-9 {{design was}} re-worked in 1934 to include enclosed <b>cockpits,</b> but dispensing with the automatic slats. The tandem <b>cockpits</b> were fitted with sliding canopies; the forward canopy slid rearwards over the fixed centre canopy section and the rear canopy slid forwards under the centre-section.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to shared avionics and computer technology, the 767 {{uses the same}} auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, and hydraulic parts as the 757. A raised <b>cockpit</b> floor and the same forward <b>cockpit</b> windows result in similar pilot viewing angles. Related design and functionality allows 767 pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate the 757 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft.|$|E

25|$|When Italy {{entered the}} war on 10 June 1940, 144 C.200s were operational, half of which were serviceable. The re-equipment programme, under which the type would have been widely adopted, was slower than {{expected}} and several squadrons {{were still in the}} process of reequipping with the C.200 upon the outbreak of war. Although the first 240 aircraft had been fitted with fully enclosed <b>cockpits,</b> the subsequent variants were provided with open <b>cockpits</b> at the request of the Italian pilots, who were made familiar with traditional open <b>cockpits</b> that had been commonplace amongst biplanes.|$|R

These additions consist of high quality {{six degrees of freedom}} <b>cockpits</b> for the Su-27, A-10A, Su-25, Su-33, and MiG-29, replacing dated <b>cockpits</b> as well as Professional Flight Models (PFM) for the F-15C Eagle, A-10A Thunderbolt II, Su-25 Frogfoot, and Su-27 Flanker.|$|R

Selex is positioning the <b>cockpit</b> as a possible upgrade of JF-17 Block III.|$|E
5|$|Su-37: Technology demonstrator, {{converted}} from the eleventh developmental Su-27M (T10M-11). The Su-37 featured a digital fly-by-wire flight-control system, a glass <b>cockpit,</b> the N011M radar, and AL-31FP engines with thrust-vectoring nozzles. The aircraft was later fitted with standard-production AL-31F engines, and had its flight-control system and <b>cockpit</b> systems revised.|$|E
5|$|The cannon is in a {{compartment}} {{beneath the}} <b>cockpit,</b> {{mounted on a}} load-bearing beam attached to the <b>cockpit</b> floor and the forward fuselage support structure. The nose is fitted with distinctive twin pitot probes and hinges up for service access.|$|E
50|$|Wooden {{construction}} biplane, conventional in layout. Fuselage rectangular in cross-section, plywood covered (engine section - metal covered). Rectangular two-spar wings, {{plywood and}} canvas covered.

50|$|Glass <b>cockpits</b> {{started to}} come into being with the Gulfstream G‑IV private jet in 1985. One of the key {{challenges}} in glass <b>cockpits</b> is to balance how much control is automated and how much the pilot should do manually. Generally they try to automate flight operations while keeping the pilot constantly informed.|$|R

5|$|The <b>cockpit</b> was {{significantly}} altered for the Comet 4's introduction, on which an improved layout {{focusing on the}} onboard navigational suite was introduced. An EKCO E160 radar unit was installed in the Comet 4's nose cone, providing search functions as well as ground and cloud mapping capabilities, and a radar interface was built into the Comet 4 <b>cockpit</b> along with redesigned instruments.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} was not systematically acquainted by Crossair {{with the}} specific features of western systems and <b>cockpit</b> procedures.|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} the same flight deck design as the 767, the 757 {{has a more}} rounded nose section than previous narrow-body aircraft. The resulting space has unobstructed panel visibility and room for an observer seat. Similar pilot viewing angles as the 767 result from a downward sloped <b>cockpit</b> floor and the same forward <b>cockpit</b> windows.|$|E
50|$|Crew {{accommodation}} {{was rather}} {{like that of}} the Valkyrie and the Southampton, with dual control tandem open <b>cockpits</b> forward of the wings, a gunner's position in the extreme nose and two staggered dorsal gunner's <b>cockpits</b> aft of the wings. Since the A.14's purpose was that of a hull demonstrator, the armament was probably never installed.|$|R
