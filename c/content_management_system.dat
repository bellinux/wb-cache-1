In September 2006, plans to shift the system to use the wiki-model were conceived (after the founding of Filipiniana.net) by its New York-based founder Gaspar Vibal and webmaster Richard Grimaldo. Octogenarian book publisher Esther A. Vibal, founder of Vibal Publishing House, Inc. (VPHI), and mother of Gaspar Vibal learned about online publishing and knowledge sharing. She introduced the concepts through Gaspar's Filipiniana.net and WikiPilipinas.org, the world’s biggest Philippine encyclopedia available on the Web.|$|E

25|$|Enterprise {{digital rights}} {{management}} (E-DRM or ERM) is the application of DRM technology to the control of access to corporate documents such as Microsoft Word, PDF, and AutoCAD files, emails, and intranet web pages {{rather than to the}} control of consumer media. E-DRM, now more commonly referenced as IRM (Information Rights Management), is generally intended to prevent the unauthorized use (such as industrial or corporate espionage or inadvertent release) of proprietary documents. IRM typically integrates with <b>content</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> software but corporations such as Samsung Electronics also develop their own custom DRM systems.|$|E
25|$|A wiki is run using wiki software, {{otherwise}} known as a wiki engine. A wiki engine {{is a type of}} <b>content</b> <b>management</b> <b>system,</b> but it differs from most other such systems, including blog software, in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little implicit structure, allowing structure to emerge according {{to the needs of the}} users. There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines are open source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Other rules may be imposed to organize content.|$|E

25|$|An {{implicit}} character encoding, {{along with}} the fact that the code position of the euro sign is different in common encoding schemes, led to many problems displaying the euro sign in computer applications. While displaying the euro sign is no problem as long as only one system is used (provided an up-to-date font with the proper glyph is available), mixed setups often produced errors. One example is a <b>content</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> where articles are stored in a database using a different character set than the editor's computer. Another is legacy software which could only handle older encodings such as ISO 8859-1 that contained no euro sign at all. In such situations, character set conversions had to be made, often introducing conversion errors such as a question mark (?) being displayed instead of a euro sign.|$|E

500|$|The gaming blog Polygon was {{launched}} on October 24, 2012, as Vox Media's third property. The site grew from technology blog The Verge, which {{was launched}} {{a year earlier}} as an outgrowth of sports blog network SB Nation before Vox Media was formed. Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff approached Joystiq editor-in-chief Christopher Grant in early 2011 about starting a video game website. Bankoff considered video games to be a logical vertical market for Vox, whose sites attracted an 18- to 49-year-old demographic. He also saw games to be an expanding market in consideration of mobile and social network game categories. Forbes described Bankoff's offer as a [...] "serious commitment to online journalism" [...] {{in an age of}} content farms and disappearing print publications, but Grant did not trust the offer and declined. Upon seeing the effort that Vox put into The Verge, their Chorus <b>content</b> <b>management</b> <b>system,</b> and the quality of their content and sponsorships, Grant changed his mind and returned to pitch Bankoff. Grant wanted the new site to compete with top gaming websites GameSpot and IGN, but still be able to run longform [...] "magazine-style journalism" [...] that could be of historic interest. As part of the site's attempt to [...] "redefine games journalism", Vox made a 13-part documentary series of the site's creation ("Press Reset") that tracked the site's creation from start to launch.|$|E

The term eTMF encompasses strategies, methods and tools used throughout the lifecycle of the clinical trial regulated content. [...] An eTMF system consists of software and hardware that facilitates the management of regulated clinical trial content.

Security researchers found that password cracking software [...] "John the Ripper" [...] was able to quickly crack over 50% of the passwords from those records with crackable password hashes. Followers of Twitter accounts set up with the same email and password were spammed with advertisements.
