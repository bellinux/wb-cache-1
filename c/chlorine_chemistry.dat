Coupled cluster theory singles and doubles with perturbative contributions of connected triples, using the series of correlation consistent basis sets with extrapolations to the complete basis set limit (CBS), were employed to quantify the energetic quantities involved in the isomerization processes on this surface. The structures and vibrational frequencies are unique for some species and represent the most accurate investigation to date.

40|$|Gaseous HCl {{generated}} {{from a variety}} of sources is ubiquitous in both outdoor and indoor air. Oxides of nitrogen (NO(y)) are also globally distributed, because NO formed in combustion processes is oxidized to NO(2), HNO(3), N(2) O(5) and a variety of other nitrogen oxides during transport. Deposition of HCl and NO(y) onto surfaces is commonly regarded as providing permanent removal mechanisms. However, we show here a new surface-mediated coupling of nitrogen oxide and halogen activation cycles in which uptake of gaseous NO(2) or N(2) O(5) on solid substrates generates adsorbed intermediates that react with HCl to generate gaseous nitrosyl chloride (ClNO) and nitryl chloride (ClNO(2)), respectively. These are potentially harmful gases that photolyze to form highly reactive chlorine atoms. The reactions are shown both experimentally and theoretically to be enhanced by water, a surprising result given the availability of competing hydrolysis reaction pathways.

40|$|Mercury {{emission}} compliance presents one of {{the major}} potential challenges raised by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Simple ways of controlling emissions have not been identified. The variability in the field data suggest that inherent mercury emissions may be reduced if the source of this inherent capture can be identified and controlled. The key mechanisms appear to involve the oxidation of mercury to Hg{sup 2 }, generally producing the more reactive HgCl{sub 2 }, followed by its capture by certain components of the fly ash or char, or in the air pollution control equipment.

40|$|Atmospheric {{mercury is}} a toxic {{air and water}} {{pollutant}} that is of significant concern because of its effects on human health and ecosystems. A mechanistic representation of the atmospheric mercury cycle is developed for the state-of-the-art global climate-chemistry model, CAM-Chem (Community Atmospheric Model with Chemistry). The model simulates the emission, transport, transformation and deposition of atmospheric mercury (Hg) in three forms: elemental mercury (Hg(0)), reactive mercury (Hg(II)), and particulate mercury (PHg). Emissions of mercury include those from human, land, ocean, biomass burning and volcano related sources. Land emissions are calculated based on surface solar radiation flux and skin temperature. A simplified air–sea mercury exchange scheme {{is used to calculate}} emissions from the oceans. The chemistry mechanism includes the oxidation of Hg(0) in gaseous phase by ozone with temperature dependence, OH, H 2 O 2 and <b>chlorine.</b> Aqueous <b>chemistry</b> includes both oxidation and reduction of Hg(0). Transport and deposition of mercury species are calculated through adapting the original formulations in CAM-Chem. The CAM-Chem model with mercury is driven by present meteorology to simulate the present mercury air quality during the 1999 – 2001 period. The resulting surface concentrations of total gaseous mercury (TGM) are then compared with the observations from worldwide sites. Simulated wet depositions of mercury over the continental United States are compared to the observations from 26 Mercury Deposition Network stations to test the wet deposition simulations. The evaluations of gaseous concentrations and wet deposition confirm a strong capability for the CAM-Chem mercury mechanism to simulate the atmospheric mercury cycle. The general reproduction of global TGM concentrations and the overestimation on South Africa indicate that model simulations of TGM are seriously affected by emissions. The comparison to wet deposition indicates that wet deposition patterns of mercury are more affected by the spatial variability of precipitation. The sensitivity experiments show that 22 % of total mercury deposition and 25 % of TGM concentrations in the United States result from domestic anthropogenic sources, but only 9 % of total mercury deposition and 7 % of TGM concentrations are contributed by transpacific transport. However, the contributions of domestic and transpacific sources on the western United States levels of mercury are of comparable magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Explaining the {{observed}} ozone trends discussed {{in an earlier}} update and predicting future trends requires {{an understanding of the}} stratospheric processes that affect ozone. Stratospheric processes occur on both large and small spatial scales and over both long and short periods of time. Because these diverse processes interact with each other, only in rare cases can individual processes be studied by direct observation. Generally the cause and effect relationships for ozone changes were established by comparisons between observations and model simulations. Increasingly, these comparisons rely on the developing, observed relationships among trace gases and dynamical quantities to initialize and constrain the simulations. The goal of this discussion of stratospheric processes is to describe the causes for {{the observed}} ozone trends as they are currently understood. At present, we understand with considerable confidence the stratospheric processes responsible for the Antarctic ozone hole but are only beginning to understand the causes of the ozone trends at middle latitudes. Even though the causes of the ozone trends at middle latitudes were not clearly determined, it is likely that they, just as those over Antarctica, involved <b>chlorine</b> and bromine <b>chemistry</b> that was enhanced by heterogeneous processes.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{reactions}} in the Antarctic stratosphere are {{the cause of}} chlorine activation and ozone depletion, but the relative roles {{of different types of}} polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) in chlorine activation is an open question. We use multi-year simulations of the chemistry-climate model ECHAM 5 /MESSy for Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) to investigate the impact that the various types of PSCs have on Antarctic chlorine activation and ozone loss. One standard and three sensitivity EMAC simulations have been performed. In all simulations a Newtonian relaxation technique using the ERA-Interim reanalysis was applied to simulate realistic synoptic conditions. In the three sensitivity simulations, we only changed the heterogeneous chemistry on PSC particles by switching the chemistry on liquid, nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) and ice particles on and off. The results of these simulations show that the significance of heterogeneous reactions on NAT and ice particles for chlorine activation and ozone depletion in Antarctic winter and spring is small in comparison to the significance of heterogeneous reactions on liquid particles. Liquid particles alone are sufficient to activate almost all of the available chlorine, {{with the exception of the}} upper PSC regions between 10 and 30 hPa, where temporarily ice particles show a relevant contribution. Shortly after the first PSC occurrence, NAT particles contribute a small fraction to <b>chlorine</b> activation. Heterogeneous <b>chemistry</b> on liquid particles is responsible for more than 90 % of the ozone depletion in Antarctic spring in the model simulations. In high southern latitudes, heterogeneous chemistry on ice particles causes only up to 5 DU of additional ozone depletion in the column and heterogeneous chemistry on NAT particles less than 0. 5 DU.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{laboratory}} study of heterogeneous reactions involving bromine and chlorine containing reservoir species on alkali salt substrates which {{are relevant to the}} marine boundary layer, and on ice substrates which are relevant to the lower stratosphere. The aim is to obtain reliable data on uptake coefficients γ and reaction mechanisms for the sake of extrapolation of results obtained in the laboratory to atmospheric conditions. The experiments have been performed in a Teflon coated Knudsen flow reactor equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The reactions of BrONO 2 with solid alkali halides have been studied at ambient temperature. The initial uptake coefficients γ 0 of BrONO 2 on NaCl and KBr substrates are γ 0 = 0. 31  ±  0. 10 and γ 0 = 0. 32  ±  0. 09, respectively. For NaCl substrates BrCl, Br 2 and HCl and for KBr both Br 2 and HBr are observed as products. HCl and HBr result from the interaction of NaCl and KBr, respectively, with HNO 3 generated in the hydrolysis of BrONO 2 with H 2 O condensed on the salt sample. Using NaCl we observed Br 2 which is formed from heterogeneous BrONO 2 decomposition occurring on solid KBr samples. Halogen exchange reactions are competing with hydrolysis and decomposition which also take place on non-reactive salts (NaNO 3, Na 2 SO 4). A high rate of initial uptake (0. 2 ≤ γ 0 ≤ 0. 4) and a Br 2 yield on the order of 50  % are observed on non-reactive salts with a closed mass balance for Br 2. The ClONO 2 -salt system has been reinvestigated. Experiments on NaCl, KBr (reactive salts) and on NaNO 3 and Na 2 SO 4 (non-reactive salts) have been performed. The hydrolysis of ClONO 2 was not observable in contrast to heterogeneous decomposition which occurred on non-reactive salts with a Cl 2 yield of (25  ±  5)  %. Calculations have been performed using a 0 -D box model in order to observe the effects of heterogeneous chemistry on sea salt in the marine boundary layer. <b>Chlorine</b> and bromine <b>chemistry</b> is activated by heterogeneous reactions occurring on NaCl and KBr which are the sole sources of chlorine and bromine in the model. Simulations performed with <b>chlorine</b> heterogeneous <b>chemistry</b> and gas phase chemistry indicate: 1) Denitrification of the troposphere (NOy converted to solid nitrates). 2) Increase of the oxidative capacity of the troposphere by the release of Cl atoms. When bromine chemistry is added to the model, the recombination reaction of NO 2 with BrO leads to an increase of tropospheric denitrification through formation of BrONO 2. Calculations show that at high [NOx], the most important bromine reservoir is BrONO 2, while at low [NOx] HOBr is the most important bromine reservoir. The uptake of HNO 3 on ice, solid sulfuric acid solutions and solid ternary solutions (STS) has been investigated at 180 to 211  K. The uptake coefficient γ decreases from 0. 30 at 180  K to 0. 06 at 211  K. The Arrhenius representation shows two distinct regimes. The first at low temperatures (180 - 190  K) shows a constant value γ of 0. 3, whereas the second regime at T > 195  K corresponds to an activation energy of Ea = - 7 ± 1 kcal/mol. At a fixed temperature, γ is independent of [HNO 3] thus confirming a rate law first order in [HNO 3]. The γ values of HNO 3 on H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O solid solutions linearly decreases from 0. 20 (0. 10) at 10 wt % H 2 SO 4 to 0. 05 (0. 03) at 98 wt % H 2 SO 4 at 180  K (200 K). The γ values of HNO 3 with STS of H 2 SO 4 /HNO 3 /H 2 O is equal to 0. 10  ±  0. 03 in the temperature range 185 - 195  K at conditions where the composition of the interface was held constant at the given temperature by adding an external flow of H 2 O. Br 2 O hydrolysis on ice surfaces occurs rapidly in the chosen temperature range of 180 to 210  K. At a fixed temperature the uptake kinetics follow an apparent first order rate law in [Br 2 O]. The observed negative temperature dependence leads to an activation energy Ea for heterogeneous hydrolysis of - 2. 3  ±  0. 6 kcal/mol. These facts point towards a complex reaction mechanism implying that the interaction of Br 2 O with ice is not an elementary reaction. BrONO 2 hydrolysis has been measured on bulk (B), condensed (C) and single crystal (SC) ice in the temperature range 180 - 210  K. On all types of ice, HOBr and Br 2 O are observed as products. At a fixed temperature the rate law is first order in [BrONO 2] with γ ≈  0. 3 at 180  K. The observed negative temperature dependence leads to an activation energy Ea for the hydrolysis of BrONO 2 on pure ice of - 2. 0  ±  0. 2, - 2. 1  ±  0. 2 and - 6. 6  ±  0. 3 kcal/mol on (C), (B) and (SC) ice, respectively, pointing towards different kinetics of BrONO 2 on these different types of ice. Doping the ice samples with HBr leads to the formation of Br 2, preceded by BrONO 2 hydrolysis. The Arrhenius representation corresponds to an activation energy of Ea = - 1. 2  ±  0. 2 kcal/mol. We investigated the structural properties of the near-surface region of various types of HX (X = Cl or Br) doped ice. Basically, we studied the time dependent [HX] in the interface region using the fast reaction titration XONO 2  + HX → X 2  + HNO 3. These experiments reveal that HX is located near the surface of the substrate in a well defined region of thickness I. The HX molecules composing the interface are immediately available for the titration reaction, whatever the flow of XONO 2. In the temperature range 190 - 200  K, we measured a value of IHCl = 43  ±  16, 250  ±  50 and 444  ±  120 nm for (SC), (C) and (B) ices, respectively and IHBr = 110  ±  15 nm on (C) ice at 205 K. Finally, we assessed the bulk diffusion coefficient for HX, DHX by modeling our results according to Fick's laws of diffusion. We obtained values of DHCl = 4. 5 · 10 - 15 - 1. 0 · 10 - 12 cm 2 /s at 190  K and DHBr = (6. 5  ±  3. 0) · 10 - 15 cm 2 /s at 205  K...|$|R
40|$|Bromoform {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} halogenated Very Short-Lived Substances (VSLS) that possibly contributes, when degradated, to the inorganic halogen loading in the stratosphere. In this paper we present a detailed modelling study of the transport and the photochemical degradation of bromoform and its product gases (PGs) in a tropical convective cloud. The aim was to explore the transport and chemistry of bromoform under idealised conditions at the cloud scale. We used a 3 -D cloud-resolving model coupled with a chemistry model including gaseous and aqueous chemistry. In particular, our model features explicit partitioning of the PGs between the gas phase and the aqueous phase based on newly calculated Henry's law coefficients using theoretical methods. We ran idealised simulations for up to 10 days that were initialised using a tropical radiosounding of atmospheric conditions and using outputs from a global chemistry-transport model for chemical species. Two simulations were run with stable atmospheric conditions with a bromoform initial mixing ratio of 40 pptv (part per trillion by volume) and 1. 6 pptv up to 1 km altitude. The first simulation corresponds to high bromoform mixing ratios that are representative of real values found near strong localised sources (e. g. tropical coastal margins) and the second to the global tropical mean mixing ratio from observations. Both of these simulations show that the sum of bromoform and its PGs significantly decreases with time because of dry deposition, and that PGs are mainly in the form of HBr after 2 days of simulation. Two further simulations are conducted; these are similar to the first two simulations but include perturbations of temperature and moisture leading to the development of a convective cloud reaching the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). Results of these simulations show an efficient vertical transport of the bromoform from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere and the TTL. The bromoform mixing ratio in the TTL is up to 45 % of the initial boundary layer mixing ratio. The most abundant organic PGs, which are not very soluble, are also uplifted efficiently in both simulations featuring the convective perturbation. The inorganic PGs are more abundant than the organic PGs, and their mixing ratios in the upper troposphere and in the TTL depend on the partitioning between inorganic soluble and insoluble species in the convective cloud. Important soluble species such as HBr and HOBr are efficiently scavenged by rain. This removal of Br y by rain is reduced by the release of Br 2 (relatively insoluble) to the gas phase due to aqueous chemistry processes in the cloud droplets. The formation of Br 2 in the aqueous phase and its subsequent release to the gas phase makes a non negligible contribution to the high altitude bromine budget in the case of the large bromoform (40 pptv) initial mixing ratios. In this specific, yet realistic case, this Br 2 production process is important for the PG budget in the upper troposphere and in the TTL above convective systems. This process is favoured by acidic conditions in the cloud droplets, i. e. polluted conditions. In the case of low bromoform initial mixing ratios, which are more representative of the mean distribution in the tropics, this Br 2 production process is shown to be less important. These conclusions could nevertheless be revisited if the knowledge of <b>chlorine</b> and bromine <b>chemistry</b> in the cloud droplets was improved in the future...|$|R
40|$|In total, {{more than}} 800. 000 single {{particle}} mass spectra have been acquired {{during the whole}} campaign (January/February 2005). To process such a high amount of data, an algorithm able to detect {{the presence or absence}} of previously selected masses/compounds has been developed. The presence or absence of specific mass peaks in every single particle mass spectrum is determined, and related to the simultaneous presence or absence of other peaks in the same particle. These kind of results can then be correlated with the wind speed and direction, and provide information about the origin of the aerosol. In this study, six key compounds have been selected: carbon, sulfate, nitrate, chlorine, ammonium and sodium. Carbon particles have their origin in combustion sources. Sulfate and nitrate give information about secondary <b>chemistry.</b> <b>Chlorine</b> is present in the coal used for heating in the Krakow area. Ammonium and sodium were frequently observed species in the aerosols from Krakow. For every single spectrum, {{the presence or absence of}} the above mentioned compounds, and all their possible combinations within a particle, has been established. The result is 64 groups, corresponding to 64 hypothetical different types of particles. Using the algorithm, key species of relevant interest may be selected, and its occurrence tracked within the samples. Some of the relevant results are: i) Indoor/outdoor: Characteristic peak (at m/z + 42), which is believed to come from organic nitrogen containing particles, is observed more often inside for all apartments than outside (Figure 1). This kind of particles could be an indicator of human activity. Generally no striking difference between indoor and outdoor for coal and non-coal heated apartments is found. The sources of indoor aerosols come from the outdoor air. ii) Site sampling: Carbon-containing particles highly dominate the aerosol. Most abundant groups contain internal mixtures of carbon, sulfate and sodium, with nitrate and chlorine in less amount (Figure 2). The four sites under examination show strong similarities in the single particle composition, and the day-by-day variations of the species follow a similar trend. This fact suggests that aerosol composition is uniform throughout the city. Furthermore, the relatively high amounts of chlorine detected in the particles, together with very high carbon content, suggest coal burning as a major source of pollution. iii) Direct measurements: From the 17 th to 19 th January 2005, a smog episode occurred in Krakow. The SPASS measurements started at 20 : 00 o’clock on the 17 th. At that time, the aerosols in Nowa Huta presented high amounts of single particles containing carbon, about 90 %. Less than 20 % of single particles contained sulfate. Throughout the night and into the morning of the 18 th of January, the relative carbon content remained almost constant, whereas the sulfate content, together with chlorine, ammonium and nitrate raised steadily. The relatively high percentages of chlorine (over 30 % in some periods) suggest that coal burning is a major source of aerosols. Regarding the mixing state, only a few of the 64 possible groups mentioned above are enough to represent most of the aerosol population. At 20 : 00 on the 17 th January, around 30 % of particles are composed of pure carbon, but the percentage falls down throughout the smog episode (Figure 3). The rest of the groups, representing over 70 % of the aerosol population, are internally mixed with carbon, sodium, chlorine and sulfate. This and other results of particle speciation and state of mixing will be presented. JRC. H. 2 -Climate chang...|$|R
