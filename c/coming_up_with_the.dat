5|$|Chocolatier was {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Big Splash Games, a trio of video game designers, who remained employees whilst developing a prototype game in their spare time. This prototype was rejected by publishers, but after <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> premise of Chocolatier the team was signed-up by PlayFirst and completed the title. The game received a mostly positive reception: reviewers enjoyed the action mini-game which is played when chocolates are manufactured, and the game's graphics, sound, and Victorian-era presentation.|$|E
5|$|Police {{investigators}} under Captain Michael Schaack had a lead fragment {{removed from}} a policeman's wounds chemically analyzed. They reported that the lead used in the casing matched the casings of bombs found in Lingg's home. A metal nut and fragments of the casing taken from the wound also roughly matched bombs made by Lingg. Schaack concluded, {{on the basis of}} interviews, that the anarchists had been experimenting for years with dynamite and other explosives, refining the design of their bombs before <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> effective one used at the Haymarket.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by David S. Cohen, Dan Greaney and Steve Tompkins, with Ken Keeler <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> story and the general idea of {{intentionally}} bad writing. It was directed by Neil Affleck, and Tim Conway, Gailard Sartain and Phil Hartman guest-starred. The producers were initially uneasy about the episode, as they feared that the purposely bad writing would be mistaken for actual bad writing. The episode, however, now appears on several lists {{of the most popular}} Simpsons episodes.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the FRC's hostile action, {{efforts were made to}} address the situation at WEVD through a fundamental reorganization of the operation. Problems to be addressed included inadequate equipment, poor broadcast location, insufficient funding, and a haphazard planning of station content. Party leader Morris Hillquit was particularly instrumental in the reorganization, <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea of selling $50,000 in WEVD stock in order to pay off standing obligations and invest in new capacity and content.|$|E

25|$|Mystery guests {{would usually}} {{attempt to conceal}} their identities with {{disguised}} voices, much to the amusement of the studio audience. According to Cerf, the panel could often determine {{the identities of the}} mystery guests early, as they knew which celebrities were in town, or which major movies or plays were about to open. On those occasions, to provide the audience an opportunity to see the guest play the game, the cast would typically allow questioning to pass around at least once before <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> correct guess.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of the rigid airship as an aircraft carrier, that was developed using Macon, led to naval planners <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea of using airships for more than scouting operations, instead operating them as offensive weapons with an air group of dive bombers. This led to the ZRCV concept, which planned for a 9 million ft3 rigid airship, significantly bigger than the Akron-class, capable of carrying up to nine Douglas-Northrop BT-1 dive bombers. However, the loss of Macon in early 1935, combined with President Roosevelt ordering a limitation {{on the size of}} new airships, meant that ZRCV was never more than an idea.|$|E
25|$|However, Garfield {{won over}} two Industrial Indemnity executives, Harold Hatch and Alonzo B. Ordway. It was Hatch who {{proposed}} to Garfield the specific solution {{that would lead}} to the creation of Kaiser Permanente: Industrial Indemnity would prepay 17.5% of premiums, or $1.50 per worker per month, to cover work-related injuries, while the workers would each contribute five cents per day to cover non-work-related injuries. Later, Garfield also credited Ordway with <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> general idea of prepayment for industrial healthcare. Garfield also later explained {{that he did not know}} much at the time about other similar health plans except for the Ross-Loos Medical Group.|$|E

25|$|When the {{publisher}} PlayFirst's blog staff interviewed with the game's producer Ryan Sindledecker, he gave players an in depth look at Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air. Taking about <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new features, Ryan shared that the developer, Kat Games {{came up with}} all the new features, including using Dream Jewels as powers. With each Dream Chronicles game, Dream Jewels were used differently. In The Book of Air there was a need to add these powers and a need to have a new use for the Jewels and they just fit together perfectly. After the Standard Edition of the game was released, Sindledecker uploaded a special walkthrough for The Book of Air on PlayFirst's blog.|$|E
25|$|In early 1948, A. R. Ghani, a Muslim from Transvaal, South Africa, offered two prizes of five {{thousand}} rupees each for the poet and composer {{of a new}} national anthem for the newly independent state of Pakistan. The prizes were announced through a government press advertisement published in June 1948. In December 1948, the Government of Pakistan established the National Anthem Committee (NAC) {{with the task of}} <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> composition and lyrics for the official national anthem of Pakistan. The NAC was initially chaired by the Information Secretary, Sheikh Muhammad Ikram, and its members included several politicians, poets and musicians, including Abdur Rab Nishtar, Ahmad G. Chagla and Hafeez Jullundhri. The NAC encountered early difficulties in finding suitable music and lyrics.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} one of her singing {{promotions}} for Where Love Has Gone that Vega was discovered by Bong Carreon, who then offered {{her to be a}} recording artist for the then newly formed Emerald Recording Company owned by Carreon and his then wife, the famous Filipina singer Imelda Papin. Her debut single Somewhere In My Past, composed by Mon Del Rosario, was a major hit which became a certified gold record in only its first few weeks of release and would prove to be her most enduring hit and the one song she would be most identified with. The single’s success prompted Bong Carreon and Imelda Papin to launch Vega as a full-time solo artist by <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> latter’s 1985 debut album First Love, which included Somewhere In My Past and produced her further hit songs like Someone Special, The Memory Will Remain, and the title track itself.|$|E

25|$|This {{movement}} of d'Erlon's Corps admits of being satisfactorily explained. Napoleon, having received information that d'Erlon {{had been left}} in reserve in front of Grosselies, and inferring, perhaps, from this circumstance that Ney was sufficiently strong {{to be able to}} hold his ground at Quatre Bras, without further aid than what he had at hand, resolved upon employing the I Corps upon the Prussian right flank; but in the meantime, d'Erlon had, in pursuance of instructions from Ney, continued his march towards Quatre Bras; and having himself proceeded in advance, had reached Frasnes, at which place Colonel Laurent found him, and communicated to him Napoleon's order for the march of the I Corps upon Saint-Amand; adding that on <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> head of his column, he had taken upon himself to change its direction of march into that of Saint-Amand. D'Erlon hastened to comply with Napoleon's wishes, and despatched General d'Elcambre, his chief of the staff, to make known the movement to Marshal Ney.|$|E
25|$|The Midwest Region {{featured}} upsets {{knocking off}} the fourth through seventh seeds. Among these {{was the first}} upset of the tournament with 11th seed Kansas State's win over the sixth seeded Southern California Trojans 80-67 in Omaha, Nebraska. The media had focused {{a lot of attention}} on the freshman stars of both teams, the Wildcats' Michael Beasley and the Trojans' O. J. Mayo. In reality, while Beasley and Mayo did well, it was the other K-State players who made the difference, applying a strong defense to the Men of Troy's attack and <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> school's first tournament win since 1988. Also in the Midwest Region, #10 seed Davidson defeated seventh seeded Gonzaga 82-76 in Raleigh, North Carolina. Stephen Curry led the Wildcats with 40 points, 30 of them in the second half. His 40 points are the fifth most in NCAA tournament history, and gave Davidson their first tournament win since 1969. In the same region, 13th seed Siena upset fourth seed Vanderbilt 83-62 in Tampa, Florida. Future Harlem Globetrotter Tay Fisher made all six of his 3-point attempts, the Saints never trailed and became the first MAAC team to advance since 2004. The Midwest's first-round play ended with 12th seed Villanova's upset of fifth seed Clemson, 75-69, also in Tampa. Behind by eighteen late in the first half, the Wildcats came back, taking the lead at about the twelve-minute mark and holding it for the win. The Wildcats have won more games as an underdog in the tournament since seedings began in 1979 than any other team. With Villanova's win, the Forum saw a tournament record four upsets in one day. Earlier in the day, WKU, San Diego, and Siena defeated Drake, UConn, and Vanderbilt, to set the record.|$|E
25|$|Kaplan credits artist Arnold Tsang from <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{preliminary}} {{designs of}} all the heroes in the game. The narrative and characters themselves were then developed through an iterative process between the gameplay developers, artists, and promotional media as they worked to bring the narrative together. In this regards, Torbjörn was the defining character for the game, as while he was not created first, his art style was originally created by Tsang to help {{bridge the gap between}} the Warcraft universe to Overwatch. Blizzard's art director Sam Didier reviewed Tsang's original design, prompting several questions to help tighten the art design that led to Torbjörn's gameplay mechanics, and subsequently, Torbjörn's appearance was used as a baseline in all other character and map designs to make sure that these assets would appear to fit into the same universe as Torbjörn. Another example is Doomfist, a character introduced into one of the game's promotional videos where his gauntlet was on display. This {{led to the creation of}} one of the maps that expanded upon the Doomfist concept, making that a title passed down among others in the past, and seeding some of the existing heroes' backstory has had connections to the Doomfist title. This process gave them a sufficient starting point to work from in introducing Doomfist as a playable hero in Overwatch. Other examples of similar iterative expansion to the characters given by Metzen and Chu include the heroes Genji and Hanzo who were characters borne out of an initial single character concept and leading to them being rivals of each other, and the introduction of Lúcio as a means to expand upon the loosely connected Vishkar Corporation concept that was part of Symmetra's backstory.|$|E
