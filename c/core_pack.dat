40|$|We have {{previously}} reported {{the development and}} evaluation of a computational program {{to assist in the}} design of hydrophobic cores of proteins. In an effort to investigate the role of <b>core</b> <b>packing</b> in protein structure, we have used this program, referred to as Repacking of Cores (ROC), to design several variants of the protein ubiquitin. Nine ubiquitin variants containing from three to eight hydrophobic core mutations were constructed, purified, and characterized in terms of their stability and their ability to adopt a uniquely folded native-like conformation. In general, designed ubiquitin variants are more stable than control variants in which the hydrophobic core was chosen randomly. However, in contrast to previous results with 434 cro, all designs are destabilized relative to the wild-type (WT) protein. This raises the possibility that beta-sheet structures have more stringent packing requirements than alpha-helical proteins. A more striking observation is that all variants, including random controls, adopt fairly well-defined conformations, regardless of their stability. This result supports conclusions from the cro studies that non-core residues contribute significantly to the conformational uniqueness of these proteins while <b>core</b> <b>packing</b> largely affects protein stability and has less impact on the nature or uniqueness of the fold. Concurrent with the above work, we used stability data on the nine ubiquitin variants to evaluate and improve the predictive ability of our <b>core</b> <b>packing</b> algorithm. Additional versions of the program were generated that differ in potential function parameters and sampling of side chain conformers. Reasonable correlations between experimental and predicted stabilities suggest the program will be useful in future studies to design variants with stabilities closer to that of the native protein. Taken together, the present study provides further clarification of the role of specific packing interactions in protein structure and stability, and demonstrates the benefit of using systematic computational methods to predict <b>core</b> <b>packing</b> arrangements for the design of proteins...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{fluorinated}} analogs of hydrophobic {{amino acids}} {{are well known}} to increase the stability of proteins toward thermal unfolding and chemical denaturation, but {{there is very little}} data on the structural consequences of fluorination. We have determined the structures and folding energies of three variants of a de novo designed 4 ‐helix bundle protein whose hydrophobic cores contain either hexafluoroleucine (hFLeu) or t ‐butylalanine (tBAla). Although the buried hydrophobic surface area is the same for all three proteins, the incorporation of tBAla causes a rearrangement of the <b>core</b> <b>packing,</b> resulting in the formation of a destabilizing hydrophobic cavity {{at the center of the}} protein. In contrast, incorporation of hFLeu, causes no changes in <b>core</b> <b>packing</b> with respect to the structure of the nonfluorinated parent protein which contains only leucine in the core. These results support the idea that fluorinated residues are especially effective at stabilizing proteins because they closely mimic the shape of the natural residues they replace while increasing buried hydrophobic surface area.

40|$|Background: Psychological {{adjustment}} to cleft lip/palate is multifaceted, and can fluctuate {{over time and}} across different situations. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of adjustment is difficult to capture, {{and the challenge of}} achieving consensus among researchers and clinicians regarding key constructs and processes is considerable. Numerous measures have been used in research and clinical audit, resulting in conflicting findings and difficulties in evidencing the value of psychological intervention. The launch of the world’s largest cleft lip/palate cohort study has provided an opportunity to standardise data collection across the UK. Objective: To describe the collaborative process used to achieve consensus in the academic and clinical measurement of psychological {{adjustment to}} cleft lip/palate. Results: Extensive work based on existing literature and clinical experience has resulted in a conceptual framework comprising six key domains of adjustment and corresponding risk/protective factors, measureable across key developmental time points. Driven by this framework, a <b>core</b> <b>pack</b> of standardised measures has been selected according to psychometric properties, clinical utility and pragmatic considerations. Conclusions: To date, these measures have been implemented within a UK-wide longitudinal cohort study (at diagnosis, 18 months, 3 years, 5 years and 8 years) and adopted into the national routine clinical audit protocol for cleft lip/palate at age five. Further data collection points will follow as the cohorts age. Over time, consistency in data collection will allow researchers to address some of the key unanswered questions in relation to psychological adjustment to cleft lip/palate.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Group I intron RNAs {{contain a}} core of highly conserved helices flanked by {{peripheral}} domains that stabilize the core structure. In the Tetrahymena group I ribozyme, the P 4, P 5, and P 6 helices of the <b>core</b> <b>pack</b> tightly against a three-helix subdomain called P 5 abc. Chemical footprinting and the crystal structure of the Tetrahymena intron P 4 -P 6 domain revealed that tertiary interactions between these {{two parts of the}} domain create an extensive solvent-inaccessible interface. We have examined the formation and stability of this tertiary interface by providing the P 5 abc segment in trans to a Tetrahymena ribozyme construct that lacks P 5 abc (E ∆P 5 abc). Equilibrium gel shift experiments show that the affinity of the P 5 abc and E ∆P 5 abc RNAs is exceptionally strong, with a Kd of ∼ 100 pM at 10 mM MgCl 2 (at 37 °C). Chemical and enzymatic footprinting shows that the RNAs are substantially folded prior to assembly of the complex. Solvent accessibility mapping reveals that, in the absence of P 5 abc, the intron RNA maintains a nativelike fold but its active-site helices are not tightly packed. Upon binding of P 5 abc, the catalytic core becomes more tightly packed through indirect effects of the tertiary interface formation. This two-component system facilitates quantitative examination of individual tertiary contacts that stabilize the folded intron. Large RNA molecules, like proteins, readily form specific molecular shapes adapted for ligand binding and catalysis...|$|E

Improved hydrophobic <b>core</b> <b>packing</b> and decreased loop-length flexibility can increase the thermodynamic stability of proteins from hyperthermophilic organisms. However, their impact on hyperthermophilic protein mechanical stability is not known. Here, we use protein engineering, biophysical characterization, single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to measure the effect of altering hydrophobic <b>core</b> <b>packing</b> on {{the stability of the}} cold shock protein TmCSP from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima. We make two variants of TmCSP in which a mutation is made {{to reduce the size of}} aliphatic groups from buried hydrophobic side chains. In the first, a mutation is introduced in a long loop (TmCSP L 40 A); in the other, the mutation is introduced on the C-terminal β-strand (TmCSP V 62 A). We use MD simulations to confirm that the mutant TmCSP L 40 A shows the most significant increase in loop flexibility, and mutant TmCSP V 62 A shows greater disruption to the <b>core</b> <b>packing.</b> We measure the thermodynamic stability (∆GD-N) of the mutated proteins and show there is a more significant reduction for TmCSP L 40 A (∆∆G = 63 %) than TmCSP V 62 A (∆∆G = 47 %) as might be expected, based on the relative reduction in the size of the side chain. By contrast SMFS measures the mechanical stability (∆G*) and shows a greater reduction for TmCSP V 62 A (∆∆G* = 8. 4 %) than TmCSP L 40 A (∆∆G* = 2. 5 %). While the impact on mechanical stability is subtle, the results demonstrate the power of tuning non-covalent interactions to modulate the mechanical stability of a protein.

40|$|AbstractDevelopment of {{a tightly}} <b>packed</b> {{hydrophobic}} <b>core</b> drives the folding of water-soluble globular proteins {{and is a}} key determinant of protein stability. Despite this, there remains much to be learnt about how and when the hydrophobic core becomes desolvated and tightly packed during protein folding. We have used the bacterial immunity protein Im 7 to examine the specificity of hydrophobic <b>core</b> <b>packing</b> during folding. This small, four-helix protein has previously been shown to fold via a compact three-helical intermediate state. Here, overpacking substitutions, in which residue side-chain size is increased, were {{used to examine the}} specificity and malleability of <b>core</b> <b>packing</b> in the folding intermediate and rate-limiting transition state. In parallel, polar groups were introduced into the Im 7 hydrophobic core via Val→Thr or Phe→Tyr substitutions and used to determine the solvation status of core residues at different stages of folding. Over 30 Im 7 variants were created allowing both series of substitutions to cover all regions of the protein structure. Φ-value analysis demonstrated that the major changes in Im 7 core solvation occur prior to the population of the folding intermediate, with key regions involved in docking of the short helix III remaining solvent-exposed until after the rate-limiting transition state has been traversed. In contrast, overpacking core residues revealed that some regions of the native Im 7 core are remarkably malleable to increases in side-chain volume. Overpacking residues in other regions of the Im 7 core result in substantial (> 2. 5  kJ mol− 1) destabilisation of the native structure or even prevents efficient folding to the native state. This study provides new insights into Im 7 folding; demonstrating that whilst desolvation occurs early during folding, adoption of a specifically <b>packed</b> <b>core</b> is achieved only at the very last step in the folding mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The dense packing {{observed}} in protein interiors {{appears to be}} crucial for stabilizing the native structure [...] even subtle internal substitutions are usually destabilizing. Thus, steric complementarity of core residues {{is thought to be}} an important criterion for "inverse folding" predictive methods, which judge whether a newly determined sequence is consistent with any known folds. A major problem in the development of useful <b>core</b> <b>packing</b> evaluation algorithms, however, is that there are occasional mutations that are predicted to disrupt native packing but that yield an equally or more stable protein. We have solved the crystal structure of such a variant of lambda repressor, which, despite having three larger core substitutions, is more stable than the wild type. The structure reveals that the protein accommodates the potentially disruptive residues with shifts in its alpha-helical arrangement. The variant is apparently more stable because its packing is improved [...] the core has a higher packing density and little geometric strain. These rearrangements, however, cause repositioning of functional residues, which result in reduced DNA binding activity. By comparing these results with the predictions of two <b>core</b> <b>packing</b> algorithms, {{it is clear that the}} protein possesses a relatively high degree of main-chain flexibility that must be accounted for in order to predict the full spectrum of compatible core sequences. This study also shows how, in protein evolution, a particular set of core residue identities might be selected not because they provide optimal stability but because they provide sufficient stability in addition to the precise structure required for optimal activity...|$|R
