25|$|Thomson {{has said}} that his {{painting}} {{was the idea that}} Stella Vine used for her painting of Princess Diana, Hi Paul <b>Can</b> <b>You</b> <b>Come</b> Over, that launched her to fame when it was bought by Charles Saatchi in 2004. Three years before, she {{had been a member of}} the Stuckist group and also briefly married to Thomson, who said that she was aware of the media appeal of the idea, as he had shown her press cuttings of the painting.|$|E

2500|$|At 3:40 a.m., a {{text was}} sent from Hedgepeth's phone {{to that of}} Brandon Edwards, a former boyfriend of hers, saying [...] "Hey b. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> over here please. Rosario needs you more aha. You know. Please let her know you care." [...] Three minutes later, another text was sent from Hedgepeth's phone to Edwards' with the single word [...] "than", {{believed}} to be a correction for the [...] "aha" [...] in the previous text. That was the last evidence of activity from her phone; at 4:16 Edwards sent a return text asking who the previous text was from.|$|E

He is sent to ask if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> {{immediately}} to play at a little dance they have resolved upon this evening--quite suddenly it seems. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>come,</b> <b>you</b> must bring with you any assistant <b>you</b> <b>can</b> lay your hands upon at a moment's notice, he says.' ...|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "Lucia Sextet" [...] (Chi mi frena in tal momento?), {{from the}} opera Lucia di Lammermoor by Gaetano Donizetti (announced by Larry as [...] "the Sextet from Lucy"), is {{played on a}} record player and lip-synched by the Stooges in Micro-Phonies. The same melody re-appears in Squareheads of the Round Table as the tune of [...] "Oh, Elaine, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> out tonight?". Micro-Phonies also {{includes}} the Johann Strauss II waltz [...] "Voices of Spring" [...] ("Frühlingsstimmen") Op. 410. Another Strauss waltz, [...] "The Blue Danube", is featured in Ants in the Pantry and Punch Drunks.|$|E
2500|$|At {{one point}} Vine was [...] "on {{the verge of}} giving up because I wasn't making any money." [...] She had not paid any {{business}} rates on the gallery for a year, and was expecting the arrival of bailiffs. The proceeds of Charles Saatchi's 2004 purchase of Vine's painting Hi Paul <b>Can</b> <b>You</b> <b>Come</b> Over went to the council bailiff. Islington London Borough Council gave Rosy Wilde an additional month's grace to pay the outstanding debts after they {{had heard of the}} Saatchi's purchase. Vine was [...] "bombarded" [...] with phone calls from galleries wanting to show her work and from art collectors seeking {{to cash in on the}} [...] "Saatchi effect"; within a week she had sold six paintings. Saatchi also bought more work from her. Vine said, [...] "I can paint and pay the bills. I don’t need any more than that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien's {{most notable}} {{achievement}} at Indian Affairs was the 1969 White Paper, {{a proposal to}} abolish the Indian Act. The paper was widely opposed by First Nations groups, and later abandoned. It was the 1969 White Paper that first brought Chrétien to widespread public attention in English Canada. At a press conference announcing the White Paper, Chrétien openly clashed with Indian activists with one First Nations women asking Chrétien [...] "When did we lose our identity?", to which the minister replied [...] "When you signed the treaties", which prompted boos and jeers. Another women from the Iroquois reserve at Brantford asked Chrétien [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> here and ask us to become citizens, when we were here long before you?", noting the Crown had granted the Grand River valley to Joseph Brant in 1784, to which Chrétien had no reply. The Cree activist Harold Cardinal in his bestselling 1969 book The Unjust Society attacked Chrétien and Trudeau for the White Paper, accusing them of [...] "cultural genocide" [...] against the First Nations. To counteract such criticism, Chrétien during a 1970 visit to the Northwest Territories adopted from the local orphanage in Inuvik an Inuit boy, whom he named Michel, whose mother was an alcoholic prostitute and whose unknown father {{had been one of}} her johns. As Indian Affairs Minister, Chrétien {{fell in love with the}} far north of Canada, whose beauty moved him, and he vacationed in the north every summer during his time while holding the Indian Affairs portfolio.|$|E

No man, wiser, unwiser, <b>can</b> make <b>thee</b> <b>come</b> or go: but thy own futilities, bewilderments, thy false appetites for Money, Windsor Georges and suchlike? No man oppresses thee, O free and independent Franchiser: but does not this stupid Porter-pot oppress thee? No Son of Adam <b>can</b> bid <b>thee</b> <b>come</b> or go; but this absurd Pot of Heavy-wet, this can and does! Thou art the thrall not of Cedric the Saxon, but of thy own brutal appetites and this scoured dish of liquor. And thou pratest of thy 'liberty'? Thou entire blockhead! ...|$|R
