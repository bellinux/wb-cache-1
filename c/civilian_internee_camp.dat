50|$|In November 1940 {{the other}} {{compound}} at Hay, Camp 6 (near the Hay Hospital), {{was occupied by}} Italian <b>civilian</b> <b>internees.</b> <b>Camps</b> 7 and 8 were vacated in May 1941 when the Dunera internees left Hay; some were sent to Orange (NSW), others to Tatura in Victoria, and others to join the Pioneer Corps of the Australian Army. Upon their departure Italian prisoners-of-war were placed in Camps 7 and 8. In December 1941 Japanese internees (some from Broome and islands north of Australia) were conveyed to Hay and placed in Camp 6. In April 1942 the River Farm began operating on {{the eastern edge of}} the town, enabling market-gardening and other farm activities to be carried out by the Italian internees and POWs. In August 1944, in the wake of the Cowra POW break-out on 5 August 1944, 600 Japanese POWs were transferred to Hay and placed in the two high-security compounds 7 and 8. On 1 March 1946 the last of the Japanese POWs left Hay. During 1946 the Italians who remained there were progressively released or transferred to other camps, and the Hay camps were dismantled, and building materials and fittings sold off, by June the following year.|$|R
25|$|Batu Lintang camp (also {{known as}} Lintang Barracks and Kuching POW camp) at Kuching, Sarawak {{on the island}} of Borneo was a Japanese {{internment}} camp during the Second World War. It was unusual in that it housed both Allied prisoners of war (POWs) and <b>civilian</b> <b>internees.</b> The <b>camp,</b> which operated from March 1942 until the liberation of the camp in September 1945, was housed in buildings that were originally British Indian Army barracks. The original area was extended by the Japanese, until it covered about 50 acres (20 hectares). The camp population fluctuated, due to movement of prisoners between camps in Borneo, {{and as a result of}} the deaths of the prisoners. It had a maximum population of some 3,000 prisoners.|$|R

He was later moved to Batu Lintang camp near Kuching in Sarawak, where he was held as a <b>civilian</b> <b>internee</b> until the <b>camp</b> was liberated in 1945.|$|R
5000|$|SS Golconda was a 5,874 gross ton {{passenger}} ship built in 1887 by William Doxford & Sons, Sunderland, England. She was 422 ft long with {{a beam of}} 41.8 ft and had two funnels and was operated by the British India Steam Navigation Company. In 1915 six hundred German <b>civilian</b> <b>internees</b> from the <b>camp</b> in Ahmednagar were transported to London on the Golconda, from where they were repatriated via the Netherlands. A further group of five hundred Germans were repatriated {{in a similar way}} in March 1916. [...] Golconda struck a mine and sank in the North Sea on 3 June 1916, [...] south east by east of Aldeburgh, Suffolk (...) with the loss of nineteen lives. She was lost while on a voyage from Tees and London to Calcutta with general cargo.|$|R
50|$|Camp 9 (also {{known as}} Italian <b>Internee</b> <b>Camp</b> No. 9) {{was one of}} three main {{prisoner}} of war (POW) and <b>internee</b> <b>camps,</b> located at Loveday, in South Australia's Riverland, approximately 12 kilometres from Renmark. This camp could hold up to 1000 people, detaining Italian <b>civilian</b> <b>internees,</b> and later Italian prisoners of war. The camp began operations on 12 August 1940 and the first Italian POW arrived at the camp on 11 June 1941. The camp guard was provided by members of 25/33 Garrison Battalion, a militia unit of the Australian Army. Many internees were released from the camp in 1944.|$|R
50|$|The Hay Internment and POW camps at Hay, New South Wales, Australia were {{established}} during World War II as prisoner-of-war and internment centres, due {{in no small}} measure to the isolated location of the town. Three high-security camps were constructed in 1940. The first arrivals were over two thousand refugees from Nazi Germany and Austria, most of whom were Jewish; they had been interned in the United Kingdom when fears of an armed invasion of Britain were at their peak. The British government then made the decision to forcibly transport these refugees to Australia on the HMT Dunera. The internees were kept in conditions on board the Dunera that were cruel and inhumane, and after the war the Dunera story became quite infamous, leading the British government to apologise for their egregious mistreatment of innocent <b>civilian</b> refugees. The <b>internees</b> arrived at Hay on 7 September 1940 by four trains from Sydney. They were interned in Camps 7 and 8 (located near the Hay showground) under the guard of the 16th Garrison Battalion of the Australian Army. In November 1940 the other compound at Hay, Camp 6 (near the Hay Hospital), was occupied by Italian <b>civilian</b> <b>internees.</b> <b>Camps</b> 7 and 8 were vacated in May 1941 when the Dunera internees left Hay; some were sent to Orange (NSW), others to Tatura in Victoria, and others to join the Pioneer Corps of the Australian Army. Upon their departure Italian prisoners-of-war were placed in Camps 7 and 8. In December 1941 Japanese internees (some from Broome and islands north of Australia) were conveyed to Hay and placed in Camp 6. In April 1942 the River Farm began operating on {{the eastern edge of the}} township, enabling market-gardening and other farm activities to be carried out by the Italian internees and POWs. In February 1945, in the wake of the Cowra POW break-out, a large number of Japanese POWs were transferred to Hay and placed in the three high-security compounds. On 1 March 1946 the Japanese POWs departed from Hay in five trains, transferred to Tatura. During 1946 the Italians who remained at Hay were progressively released or transferred to other camps, and the Hay camps were dismantled and building materials and fittings sold off by June the following year.|$|R
5000|$|In general, <b>civilian</b> <b>internees</b> of the Japanese {{were treated}} less harshly than were {{prisoners of war}} (POWs). Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs {{administered}} the <b>internee</b> <b>camps</b> while the Ministry of War administered the POW camps. The Japanese left the internal administration of the <b>camps</b> mostly in <b>internee</b> hands, providing only small amounts of food, fuel, and other necessities to the internees. As the fortunes of war turned against Japan, conditions for internees worsened {{and by the end}} of the war starvation threatened in many camps. [...] The self-rule, self-sufficiency, and cooperation of the internees permitted the Japanese to control <b>internee</b> <b>camps</b> with a minimum of resources and personnel, amounting at times to only 17 administrators and 8 guards at Santo Tomas for more than 3,000 internees.|$|R

40|$|In 1946 Winston Churchill was {{preparing}} to journey to Switzerland {{for one of his}} many post-war speaking tours. Included in the events on his itinerary was a visit to Geneva, where he was to be the guest of honour at a luncheon hosted by Max Huber, the international lawyer, academic and occasional advisor to the Swiss Federal Council, who had been the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) during the Second World War. Although the ICRC’s members had carried no arms and its main base of operations on the tranquil banks of Lake Geneva, the Villa Moynier, had suffered no air raids, many carried scars from the conflict not unlike those of the man whose decisive contributions they were honouring. The 179 delegates recruited by the ICRC during the war — Swiss volunteers whose only protection from harm in the field was a white armband emblazoned with a Red Cross and the willingness of belligerents to adhere to International Humanitarian Law (IHL) — exerted themselves tremendously on behalf of Allied and Axis soldiers, and the many civilians caught between their clash of arms. The delegates’ status as neutral, impartial humanitarian actors having been codified in the 1929 Geneva Convention, {{the men and women of}} the ICRC traversed the globe throughout the conflict and its aftermath, delivering food and medical relief to Prisoners of War (POWs) and <b>civilian</b> <b>internees,</b> inspecting the <b>camps</b> in which they were detained and reporting on the status of their health and well-being to belligerent governments [...] ...|$|R
