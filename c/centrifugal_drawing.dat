40|$|Before {{setting out}} {{a sketch of}} what poetic {{research}} may be this paper describes briefly two polar philosophical attitudes to research- one that grounds in methodological rigour and the other {{that is in the}} main anti-methodological. The paper then sets aside the notion of these polar attitudes to consider two impulses in work (research/practice) - the centripetal and the <b>centrifugal</b> (<b>drawing</b> on Bakhtin) and sets out the poetic as a co-efficient that conditions the relationship between the two. A metaphorical image, the Reservoir, is then introduced that allows one to map these forces and organise a (re) search in which the active imagination is foregrounded. The reservoir may be used at various points of a programme of creative practice and for different ends- to generate, to build and to analyse. [Abstract...|$|E
40|$|Centrifugal {{apparatus}} produces filled spherical shells for {{wide range}} of industrial and scientific applications. Rotating container has radially extending nozzle in which <b>centrifugal</b> force <b>draws</b> liquid shell material from container. Liquid shell material fed from outside container and automatically maintained at fixed level. Along axis of nozzle is tube that connects through rotating seal to source of gas or other filler material. Material-flow and rotation rates adjusted to change bubble size...|$|R
50|$|As {{the canvas}} rotates, <b>centrifugal</b> forces <b>draw</b> the wet paint outwards, {{creating}} intricate designs. The artist can drip more paint onto the canvas {{while it is}} spinning, thus layering paints {{on top of each}} other, creating different effects. Using different colors, a skilled spin artist can blend colors together into subtle designs. At any point during this process, the artist can stop the spinning platform to view the canvas. Since the canvas is usually rotating at a high rate, it is difficult if not impossible to view the image on the canvas until the platform has stopped spinning, thus creating a sense of surprise and uncertainty during the creation process.|$|R
50|$|The <b>centrifugal</b> {{supercharger}} <b>draws</b> {{its power}} from {{the movement of the}} drive where it is attached. At this point, the supercharger powers an impeller - or small rotating wheel. The impeller draws air into a small compressor housing (volute) and centrifugal force sends the air into the diffuser. The result is air that is highly pressurized, but that travels at low speed. The high-pressure, low-speed air is then fed into the engine, where the additional pressure gives the engine the ability to burn more fuel and have a higher level of combustion. This results in a faster, more responsive vehicle due to greater engine volumetric efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The PS4 {{cooling system}} uses a single <b>centrifugal</b> fan, which <b>draws</b> air in {{from both sides}} of the console, split into flows above and below the main PCB, before {{entering}} the fan from top and bottom; the fan exhaust then cools the main APU via a heat pipe - connected heatsink, with the exhaust passing over the main power supply before being emitted from the rear of the console.|$|R
50|$|The {{separation}} of uranium requires {{the material in}} a gaseous form; uranium hexafluoride (UF6) is used for uranium enrichment. Upon entering the centrifuge cylinder, the UF6 gas is rotated at a high speed. The rotation creates a strong <b>centrifugal</b> force that <b>draws</b> more of the heavier gas molecules (containing the U-238) toward {{the wall of the}} cylinder, while the lighter gas molecules (containing the U-235) tend to collect closer to the center. The stream that is slightly enriched in U-235 is withdrawn and fed into the next higher stage, while the slightly depleted stream is recycled back into the next lower stage.|$|R

Then there are the Polar {{electric}} forces, attracting objects toward the north or south poles. You have guessed something of this {{by the use of}} the compass, or electric needle. Opposed to these is <b>centrifugal</b> electric force, <b>drawing</b> objects from east to west, or in the opposite direction. This force is created by the whirl of the earth upon its axis, and is easily utilized, although your scientific men have as yet paid little attention to it.|$|R
40|$|The design, {{construction}} {{and testing of}} a single stage centrifugal pump is presented in this project work, electric motor drives the <b>centrifugal</b> pump, which <b>draws</b> ﬂuid (water) from a water storage wall and delivers same through a ﬂow control valve to a tank. The experimental results obtained shows that the tested pump can develop a head, (H) of 30 m, volumetric discharge, (Q) of 9 m 3 /hr and the speed of 2900 rpm for an input power of 1. 5 HP (1. 1 k). The operation of the pump was observed to be very smooth with low vibration and noise level on the pump and motor respectively, this guarantee {{the reliability of the}} pump in service...|$|R
50|$|The {{evaporative}} cooler {{was the subject}} of numerous US patents in the 20th century; many of these, starting in 1906, suggested or assumed the use of excelsior (wood wool) pads as the elements to bring a large volume of water in contact with moving air to allow evaporation to occur. A typical design, as shown in a 1945 patent, includes a water reservoir (usually with level controlled by a float valve), a pump to circulate water over the excelsior pads and a <b>centrifugal</b> fan to <b>draw</b> air through the pads and into the house. This design and this material remain dominant in {{evaporative cooler}}s in the American Southwest, where they are also used to increase humidity. In the United States, {{the use of the term}} swamp cooler may be due to the odor of algae produced by early units.|$|R
5000|$|For the He 177, Günter {{decided to}} employ {{two of the}} complex Daimler-Benz DB 606 [...] "power system" [...] setups for propulsion. He had already {{employed}} these engines on the record-breaking Heinkel He 119 reconnaissance aircraft prototypes. They consisted {{of a pair of}} DB 601 liquid-cooled 12-cylinder inverted-vee inline engines mounted side by side in a nacelle - for the He 119, centrally within the fuselage, just behind its heavily glazed cockpit enclosure - driving one propeller. The two engines were inclined inwards by 30° when mounted onto either side of their common, vertical-plane space-frame primary engine mount, so that the inner cylinder banks were disposed almost vertically. A common gear-housing connected the front ends of the two crankcases, with the two crankshaft pinions driving a single airscrew shaft gear. The outer sides of each of the component engines' crankcases were connected to the nacelle firewall through forged mountings similar to what would be used for either a single DB 601 or DB 605 engine-powered aircraft installation. When combined with the central space-frame mount designed especially for the [...] "power system" [...] format, this resulted in a Daimler-Benz [...] "coupled" [...] twin-crankcase [...] "power system" [...] having a trio of engine mount structures within its nacelle accommodation. The starboard DB 601 component engine had to be fitted with a mirror-image version of its mechanically driven <b>centrifugal</b> supercharger, <b>drawing</b> air from the starboard side of the engine. Two of the DB 606s, each of which initially developed 2,600 PS (2,564 hp, 1,912 kW) for take-off and weighing some 1,515 kg (3,340 lb) apiece, were to power the He 177. The DB 606 — and its eventual replacement, the Daimler-Benz DB 605-based [...] "DB 610" [...] — were to be the only two production German aviation powerplants designed to surpass 1,500 kW of power, something that the Germans had considerable challenges in developing during the war into production-ready, combat-reliable aviation engines.|$|R
