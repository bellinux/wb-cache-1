5|$|Vainio {{returned}} to {{teaching in the}} early 1970s. Vainio made up nicknames for all his pupils, who in return called him Junnu. He {{had a habit of}} <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> very unorthodox methods of punishment but in general got on well with his pupils.|$|E
5|$|Another Green World was {{recorded}} at Island Studios in London {{during the months}} of July and August 1975. Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared beforehand. For the first four days in the studio, Eno failed to be productive. To look for new ideas, Eno turned to his instructional cards, the Oblique Strategies, and began <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> new ideas {{as he did with}} his previous album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).|$|E
5|$|Chocolatier was {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Big Splash Games, a trio of video game designers, who remained employees whilst developing a prototype game in their spare time. This prototype was rejected by publishers, but after <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the premise of Chocolatier the team was signed-up by PlayFirst and completed the title. The game received a mostly positive reception: reviewers enjoyed the action mini-game which is played when chocolates are manufactured, and the game's graphics, sound, and Victorian-era presentation.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} of August 1968, Deep Purple entered De Lane Lea Studios in Kingsway, London, with {{producer}} Derek Lawrence and sound engineer Brian Aintsworth, who had both worked on their previous album. Tetragrammaton's advance of $250,000 {{had been used to}} book two weeks in the studio, a time which covered songwriting, rehearsals and recording sessions. Time was granted in larger amount than for the making of Shades of Deep Purple in May, feeding the band’s ambition of <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> better original material than their previous effort.|$|E
5|$|Police {{investigators}} under Captain Michael Schaack had a lead fragment {{removed from}} a policeman's wounds chemically analyzed. They reported that the lead used in the casing matched the casings of bombs found in Lingg's home. A metal nut and fragments of the casing taken from the wound also roughly matched bombs made by Lingg. Schaack concluded, {{on the basis of}} interviews, that the anarchists had been experimenting for years with dynamite and other explosives, refining the design of their bombs before <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the effective one used at the Haymarket.|$|E
5|$|Some recent notable {{projects}} {{have included the}} Deployable Joint Command and Control System and ULTRA AP, a concept combat vehicle. In 2010, researchers developed microfabricated planar ion traps using VLSI techniques {{for use in a}} trapped ion quantum computer. Also in 2010, researchers developed a method of using GPGPU to crack passwords, <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a minimum secure password length of 12 characters. Researchers are investigating the use of radar as a possible concussion detection tool.|$|E

6000|$|... "What's the matter?" [...] called Ben, <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> briskly, <b>with</b> {{a strong}} grip of his stout stick. There {{was no need}} of any answer, for, as {{he came into the}} shadow, he saw the man, and stood looking {{at him as if he}} were a ghost.|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by David S. Cohen, Dan Greaney and Steve Tompkins, with Ken Keeler <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the story and the general idea of {{intentionally}} bad writing. It was directed by Neil Affleck, and Tim Conway, Gailard Sartain and Phil Hartman guest-starred. The producers were initially uneasy about the episode, as they feared that the purposely bad writing would be mistaken for actual bad writing. The episode, however, now appears on several lists {{of the most popular}} Simpsons episodes.|$|E
5|$|The group {{remembered the}} {{recording}} being a happy process, {{with a strong}} feeling of camaraderie and fun, with numerous practical jokes. They were fans of Python, and this style of humour influenced the lyrics and overall concept. Guitarist Martin Barre recalls the whole band <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> various ideas for the music. Some parts were recorded in a single take with every member having an input, including significant contributions from keyboardist John Evan.|$|E
5|$|The {{leadership}} of the Polish Jews was aware that Bełżec and Treblinka had been closed, dismantled and all remaining prisoners {{had been sent to}} the gas-chambers and they suspected that Sobibor would be next. There was a great urgency in <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a good escape plan, and Pechersky, with his army experience, was their best hope. The escape had to also coincide with the time when the Sobibor's deputy commandant Gustav Wagner went on vacation, since the prisoners felt that he was sharp enough to uncover the escape plan.|$|E

5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) takes some of the office staff on a field trip to Gettysburg for inspiration. Meanwhile, the rest of the office, under orders from Robert California (James Spader), are tasked with <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a new business idea for Dunder Mifflin. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) proposes several vending machine ideas that capture California's imagination.|$|E
5|$|They {{made all}} these {{different}} bits up, not {{thinking in terms of}} verse, chorus, bridge or what was going to go where, just <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> all these sections of chanting, rapping and singing, which we recorded all higgledy-piggledy. And then we just sewed it together. It was rather like the way we'd been working on the dance remixes we'd been doing before. Kind of a cut-and-paste method.|$|E
5|$|By September, several Blenheims were {{equipped}} {{with what was}} now officially known as AI Mk. I and training of the crews began with No. 25 Squadron at RAF Northolt. Robert Hanbury Brown, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, and <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars in the nose and pointed out to Bowen that the enemy gunners would see {{the light from the}} CRTs and shoot the operator. The sets were re-fitted once again, returning {{to the rear of the}} fuselage, which caused more delays.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 November 2007 Croatia {{defeated}} Malta 24-9 in Makarska. There are two internationals <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> in 2008 <b>with</b> Croatia {{taking on}} Andorra in Split (19 April) and away to Latvia in Riga (10 May) ...|$|R

5|$|Lucas {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film in 1972, approaching Howard to direct during the post-production phase of Cocoon in 1985. Bob Dolman was brought in to write the screenplay, <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> seven drafts before finishing in late 1986. It was then set up at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and principal photography began in April 1987, finishing the following October. The majority of filming took place at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England, as well as Wales and New Zealand. Industrial Light & Magic created the visual effects sequences, which led to a revolutionary breakthrough with digital morphing technology. The film was released in 1988 to mixed reviews from critics, but was a modest financial success, received two Academy Award nominations, and has developed a cult following amongst fantasy fans.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} the episode {{developed}} from writer Jon Vitti <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{a long list}} of bad things Bart would do for attention imagining the potential consequences. The only idea that developed into an interesting episode concept was Bart cheating on an IQ test. This idea was based on an incident from Vitti's childhood when a number of his classmates did not take an intelligence test seriously and suffered poor academic treatment because of it. Because Bart was already obviously unintelligent, Vitti reversed the problem for his episode. Vitti used all his memories of elementary school behavior to produce a draft script of 71 pages, substantially above the required length of about 45 pages.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in Greenwich Village, New York. The main character, Mike de Wolf, is a {{struggling}} pianist. His friend, Horace Hackett, {{is an author}} and popular pulp fiction writer. Hackett is portrayed in the book as a skilled writer able to quickly produce voluminous amounts of material for pulp magazines. Hackett writes under stress, as he is facing a deadline. Hackett attempts to persuade his book publisher that he has almost finished writing his latest novel, while in actuality he has already depleted his advance payment prior to <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{an idea for a}} story. Hackett's publisher pressures him and he rapidly decides to place his friend Mike as the central character in his story.|$|E

5000|$|Invented by David Silk, the paddler {{leaves a}} helmet {{floating}} {{upside down in}} the water next to them, then performs a flatwater loop into the helmet, <b>coming</b> back <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the helmet on.

60|$|He was right, {{the captain}} was <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> in company <b>with</b> Rosenvischpoff and two sailors. The Russian petty officer {{opened the door of}} the pen and Captain Ponsberry was thrust inside. Then the door was locked as before.|$|R
5|$|In {{creating}} original music, Shimomura {{wanted to}} create compositions that would make players feel good while playing to accompany the action aspect of Kingdom Hearts. She played the game and looked over scripts and illustrations for inspiration. After <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> ideas, she discussed them with director Tetsuya Nomura and the game planners. For the PlayStation 2 re-release of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, she and her team spent {{much of their time}} working on the fight music; Shimomura wanted the different fight music to reflect different emotions such as happiness and sadness. To handle the large workload for Kingdom Hearts coded, Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Shimomura composed the most prominent themes, while the rest was created by other composers. In retrospect, Shimomura has stated that the Kingdom Hearts series combined the scenes and music well, and she felt very honored her music has entered into people's hearts. She has also commented that she enjoyed working on the project, despite its hardships, and is proud of the work.|$|E
5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E
5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a way to display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was {{not in the business of}} making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E

60|$|When travel {{had been}} resumed, half-way {{down the slope}} Dale's sharp eyes caught a broad track where shod horses had passed, {{climbing}} in a long slant toward the promontory. He dismounted to examine it, and John, <b>coming</b> <b>up,</b> proceeded <b>with</b> alacrity to get off and do likewise. Dale made his deductions, after which he stood in a brown study beside his horse, waiting for John.|$|R
