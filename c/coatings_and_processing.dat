The potential increase of from 40 to 110 C in operational temperature capabilities predicted for directionally solidified eutectics {{is a larger}} increment over currently available alloys than previously obtained in any new turbine blade alloy.

50|$|Magnesium is a {{relatively}} new biomaterial that has recently been gaining traction. While degrading harmlessly, it has been shown to possess a functional degradation time of about 30 days in vivo. This is much short of the three-to-six month window desired for bioabsorbable stents. Thus, much attention has been given to drastically reducing the rate of magnesium corrosion by alloying, coating, etc. Many novel methods have surfaced to minimize the penetration rate and hydrogen evolution rate (or, in layman's terms, the corrosion rate). One of the most successful has involved the creation of bioabsorbable metallic glasses via rapid solidification. Other, alternative solutions have included the development of magnesium-rare-earth (Mg-RE) alloys, which benefit from the low cytotoxicity of RE elements. <b>Coatings</b> <b>and</b> sophisticated materials <b>processing</b> routes are currently being developed to further decrease the corrosion rate. However a number of issues remain limiting the further development of Mg biomaterials in general.|$|R
40|$|Ultrahigh {{temperature}} ceramics (UHTCs) are a {{class of}} materials that include the diborides of metals such as hafnium and zirconium. The materials are of interest to NASA for their potential utility as sharp leading edges for hypersonic vehicles. Such an application requires that the materials be capable of operating at temperatures, often in excess of 2, 000 C. UHTCs are highly refractory and have high thermal conductivity, an advantage for this application. UHTCs are potentially applicable for other high-temperature processing applications, such as crucibles for molten-metal <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> high-temperature electrodes. UHTCs were first studied in the 1960 s by the U. S. Air Force. NASA s Ames Research Center concentrated on developing materials in the HfB 2 /SiC family for a leading-edge application. The work focused on developing a process to make uniform monolithic (2 -phase) materials, and on the testing and design of these materials. Figure 1 shows arc-jet models made from UHTC materials fabricated at Ames. Figure 2 shows a cone being tested in the arc-jet. Other variations of these materials being investigated elsewhere include zirconium based materials and fiber-reinforced composites. Current UHTC work at Ames covers four broad topics: monoliths, <b>coatings,</b> composites, <b>and</b> <b>processing.</b> The goals include improving the fracture toughness, thermal conductivity and oxidation resistance of monolithic UHTCs and developing oxidation-resistant UHTC coatings for thermal-protection-system substrates through novel coating methods. As part of this effort, researchers are exploring compositions <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> changes that have yielded improvements in properties.

40|$|Carbon-carbon {{composites}} are {{a specialty}} class of materials having many unique properties making these composites attractive {{for a variety}} of demanding engineering applications. Chief among these properties are exceptional retention of mechanical properties at temperatures as high as 4000 F, excellent creep resistance, and low density (1. 6 to 1. 8 g/cu cm). Although carbon-carbon composites are currently in service in a variety of applications, much development work remains to be accomplished before these materials can be considered to be fully mature, realizing their full potential. Four recent technology advances holding particular promise for overcoming current barriers to the wide-spread commercialization of carbon-carbon composites are described. These advances are: markedly improved interlaminar strengths (more than doubled) of two dimensional composites achieved by whiskerization of the fabric reinforcing plies, simultaneously improved oxidation resistance and mechanical properties achieved by the incorporation of matrix-phase oxidation inhibitors based on carborane chemistry, improved oxidation resistance achieved by compositionally graded oxidation protective <b>coatings,</b> <b>and</b> markedly reduced <b>processing</b> times (hours as opposed to weeks or months) accomplished through a novel process of carbon infiltration <b>and</b> <b>coatings</b> deposition based on the use of liquid-phase precursor materials...|$|R

This development, alongside the lack of understanding of the real financial value of smartphones has given rise to a general lack of active care for these devices. Through critical design, this project aims to highlight this lack of care and to provoke a reaction that will encourage the audience to consider taking better care of their possessions.

40|$|High {{energy density}} {{polymeric}} dielectric films were prepared by plasma polymerization {{of a variety}} of gaseous monomers. This technique gives thin, reproducible, pinhole free, conformable, adherent, <b>and</b> insoluble <b>coatings</b> <b>and</b> overcomes the <b>processing</b> problems found in the preparation of thin films with bulk polymers. Thus, devices are prepared completely in a vacuum environment. The plasma polymerized films prepared all showed dielectric strengths of greater than 1000 kV/cm and in some cases values of greater than 4000 kV/cm were observed. The dielectric loss of all films was generally less than 1 % at frequencies below 10 kHz, but this value increased at higher frequencies. All films were self healing. The dielectric strength was a function of the polymerization technique, whereas the dielectric constant varied with the structure of the starting material. Because of the thin films used (thickness in the submicron range) surface smoothness of the metal electrodes was found to be critical in obtaining high dielectric strengths. High dielectric strength graft copolymers were also prepared. Plasma polymerized ethane was found to be thermally stable up to 150 C in the presence of air and 250 C in the absence of air. No glass transitions were observed for this material...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} improvements {{associated with}} the life of cutting tools used to machine M 42 tool steel,Titanium alloy (Ti- 64) and modified AISI P 20 tool steel. Titanium {{is one of the}} important metals is used in various fields of engineering and medical sciences. In order {{to assess the impact of}} different tool coatings on the machining process, initial experiments simulate existing machining operations; this provides a standard for tool life and surface finish. The findings in the paper show that TiAlCrYN coated WC-Co cutting tools perform better than uncoated cutting tools to machine M 42 tool steel. The implications of the paper tend to indicate that machining M 42 tool steels without lubricant can be optimized using coated cutting tools. Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) can be successfully used to machining of titanium alloy (Ti- 64) and modified AISI P 20 tool steel using TiN coated inserts. The limitations of the paper include machining at one specific cutting speed and the employment of a short-time tool wear method. The practical implications of the paper show that dry machining of hardened tool steels can be achieved under certain circumstances. One of the main pre-requisites for successful industrial production is the use of quality coated cutting tools with defined mechanical and technological properties.

40|$|AbstractThe metal-organic {{deposition}} (MOD) method using trifluoroacetate (TFA) salts {{is considered}} to be an effective method for inexpensively fabricating YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -y (YBCO) coated conductors with high critical current density property. The long-length TFA-MOD YBCO coated conductors have been fabricated by multi-turn reel-to-reel system. Increasing the thickness per single coating in the multi-turn reel-to-reel system is a cost-effective technique for fabrication of the precursor films in the calcination process since it reduces the number of <b>coatings</b> <b>and</b> shortens the <b>processing</b> time. In this work, we have developed a new starting solution consisting of non-fluorine salts of yttrium propionate and copper 2 -ethylhexanoate with focusing on increasing the thickness per single coating for a high-rate fabrication of the YBCO coated conductors by the TFA-MOD method. The critical thickness per single coating of the precursor film fabricated from the new starting solution was improved to 0. 44 μm/coat. Furthermore, the addition of diacetoneacrylamide in the new starting solution increased the critical thickness per single coating to 0. 79 μm/coat. High critical current of 791 A/cm-width with high critical current density of 2. 7 MA/cm 2 was obtained using the new starting solution with diacetoneacrylamide at the thickness per single coating of 0. 49 μm/coat...|$|R
