40|$|Abstract: <b>Collaborative</b> <b>robots</b> {{represent}} a nonlinear system having nonholonomic constraints. Due to nonholonomic constraints, the <b>collaborative</b> <b>robots</b> are not point stabilizable using continuous time-invariant feedback. Therefore, linear control is ineffective so that innovative design techniques are required. One such possible technique is feedback linearization. This paper proposes a kinematically compatible {{framework for the}} development of nonholonomic <b>collaborative</b> <b>robots</b> using feedback control techniques. It presents a comparative assessment of various standard feedback control strategies. The nonholonomic collaborative robotic system is modeled using Simulink and the results are presented confirming the performance of various controllers. From the simulation results, the nonlinear feedback control strategy improves the system performance. Furthermore, the nonlinear control strategy globally-asymptotically stabilizes the system compared to the other feedback strategies. The work presented here is an initial study concerning the applicability of kinematic based control on <b>collaborative</b> <b>robots.</b> Copyright © 2007 IFA...|$|R

40|$|The lack of human-robot {{collaboration}} currently presents a bottleneck to {{widespread use of}} robots in urban search & rescue (USAR) missions. The paper argues that {{an important aspect of}} realizing {{human-robot collaboration}} is collaborative control, and the recognition and expression of affect. Affective <b>collaborative</b> <b>robots</b> can enhance joint human-robot performance by adapting the robots (social) role and interaction to the users affective state and the context. Current USAR robots lack these capabilities. This paper presents theory, application domains, and requirements for affective <b>collaborative</b> <b>robots</b> based on {{the current state of the}} art. With methods from cognitive architectures, affective computing, and human-robot interaction, three core functions of affective <b>collaborative</b> <b>robots</b> can be realized: sliding autonomy, affective communication, and adaptive attitude. These robot functions can substantially enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of rescue workers and meanwhile reduce their cognitive workload. Furthermore, robots with such functions can approach civilians in the field appropriately. Keywords Human-robot interaction; affective computing; collaboration and decision processe...|$|R

40|$|The {{collaborative}} approach where humans use robots as {{an intelligent}} assistant {{in the same}} workspace to achieve a common goal have become a powerful tool. <b>Collaborative</b> <b>robots</b> support quick adaptation to changing requirements, by quick reconfigurability to a new product- or process mix, and quick adaptability to different processes in the production line. In other words, they enable flexibility in the production processes; also known under the concept of ‘agility’ in the supply chain literature. At the same time, cobots have shown to enable lean processes in the production line by reducing cost due to elimination of waste. For example, the cobots enable reduced installation and reconfiguring time, less process complexity, prevent unused employee creativity and they need less manufacturing space. By combining the lean and agile manufacturing paradigms in the supply chain, the benefits from both worlds can be achieved. This thesis explores the <b>collaborative</b> <b>robot’s</b> ability, as a process technology strategy, to enable leagile manufacturing (by extrapolating lean and agile) with improved performance from flexibility and lean processes, in industrial environments with high product- and process variety. Further to show how to implement the product variety across the supply chain, including the manufacturing processes. The findings are summarized by a conceptual framework for leagile manufacturing through <b>collaborative</b> <b>robots.</b> This is achieved by triangulating an explorative literature study (by reviewing supply chain management and production systems literature and real-life cases) and expert interviews.

40|$|International audience— Industrials are {{starting}} to deploy <b>collaborative</b> <b>robots</b> as new solutions to improve workstations. In particular workstations where human operators may get injured because of repetitive tasks, bad postures or heavy loads are targeted. <b>Collaborative</b> <b>robots</b> can also be an alternative to robots which may take up too much floor space with their safeguards or are not flexible and smart enough to handle complex operations. The introduction of such interactive systems on industrial workstations must satisfy the following requirements: ergonomics and safety of the system, quality and performance of operations, and human well-being. We propose a human-centered approach to improve the introduction of <b>collaborative</b> <b>robots</b> in the industry. Several industrial applications are studied within Safran and Airbus Safran Launchers. In this paper, we present the first application of our work on a pyrotechnic tank cleaning workstation.

Collaborative robots (Cobots) have been introduced to guide and assist human operators to move heavy objects in a given trajectory. Most of the existing cobots use steering wheels; typical drawbacks of using steering wheels include the difficulties to (i) follow a trajectory with a curvature larger {{than that of the}} base platform, (ii) mount encoders on steering wheels due to self-spinning of the wheels, and (iii) quarantine dynamic control performance since it is purely kinematic control.

40|$|The {{past thirty}} years have seen {{increasingly}} rapid advances {{in the field of}} laparoscopic surgery, {{in part because of the}} use of robots. A well-known example is the da Vinci surgical system. However, far too little attention has been paid to Hand Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery (HALS), a surgery in which the surgeon introduces the non-dominant hand into the abdomen of the patient. The risk of collision between the hand of the surgeon and the tool moved by the robot is the reason why these robots for laparoscopic surgery are not appropriate for HALS. On the other hand, in recent years, there has been an increasing interest in wearables, which have been introduced in our daily life. This interest and the lack of surgery robots for HALS are the reasons to develop a sensing glove which co-works whit a <b>collaborative</b> <b>robot</b> in this kind of surgery. The aim of this paper is to study the use of a sensing glove which will provide information of the movements of the surgeon’s hand to the <b>collaborative</b> <b>robot.</b> This information determinates the actions that the robot will carry on. The first step was to define different movements of the hand which could be identified. An algorithm identifies these movements using the data given by the sensing glove. For the purpose of algorithm accuracy measurement, 4 persons wearing the sensing glove made a sequence with different movements. The evidence from this study suggests that a sensing glove can be used to send information of the movements of the surgeon’s hand to a <b>collaborative</b> <b>robot</b> during a HALS...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for movement recognition in hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery using a textile-based sensing glove. The {{aim is to}} recognize the commands given by the surgeon’s hand inside the patient’s abdominal cavity in order to guide a <b>collaborative</b> <b>robot.</b> The glove, which incorporates piezoresistive sensors, continuously captures the degree of flexion of the surgeon’s fingers. These data are analyzed throughout the surgical operation using an algorithm that detects and recognizes some defined movements as commands for the <b>collaborative</b> <b>robot.</b> However, hand movement recognition {{is not an easy}} task, because of the high variability in the motion patterns of different people and situations. The data detected by the sensing glove are analyzed using the following methodology. First, the patterns of the different selected movements are defined. Then, the parameters of the movements for each person are extracted. The parameters concerning bending speed and execution time of the movements are modeled in a prephase, in which all of the necessary information is extracted for subsequent detection during the execution of the motion. The results obtained with 10 different volunteers show a high degree of precision and recall...|$|E
