Filming there again ran smoothly, until {{it came time to}} shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Diarra was heavily linked with a move to the champions Marseille. On 14 July, Marseille manager Didier Deschamps {{confirmed}} that the club was negotiating with both Diarra and Bordeaux for a transfer. A week later, Bordeaux president Triaud stated that Marseille had failed to meet the player's €7.75million release clause and that Diarra was likely not going to be leaving the club. Despite Marseille remaining hopeful a deal <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>through,</b> on 30 July, a deal was declared dead. Diarra later stated that he was happy to remain at Bordeaux and see out the rest of his contract. The defensive midfielder opened the new campaign scoring two goals in the first six matches of the season in wins over Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon.|$|E

25|$|Early on March 31, 1865, Union Major General Philip Sheridan told Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant that he {{believed}} he could turn the Confederate right or make a breakthrough if the rain stopped {{and he had the}} help of an infantry corps. Sheridan wanted the VI Corps commanded by Major General Horatio G. Wright, which he had worked with in the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864, not the V Corps under Major General Gouverneur Warren whom Sheridan did not trust. Grant replied a few hours later that the VI Corps was {{in the center of the}} line and too far away to support Sheridan but he could move the II Corps by the next day. Grant also said that Wright thought he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the line from his current position. Although heavy rain continued that day, Confederate Major General George E.

500|$|Jon Povill wrote {{up a list}} of {{possible}} directors for the project, which included Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, Lucas and Robert Wise, but all were busy at the time or unwilling to work with a $7.5 million budget. Although his agent did not expect him to do it, Philip Kaufman signed on to direct. Roddenberry introduced him to the series by showing him ten episodes, including those he felt were the most representative and popular of the series: [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever", [...] "The Devil in the Dark", [...] "Amok Time", [...] "Journey to Babel", [...] "", [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles", [...] "", [...] "The Corbomite Maneuver", [...] "" [...] and [...] "". On signing, Kaufman was pleased to direct Star Trek. He discussed it with Lucas, and said that he [...] "felt he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the roof".

500|$|The El Capitan Theatre, at Nixon's insistence, {{was entirely}} deserted. Press members were {{confined}} to a nearby room, where they could watch on television; stenographers were {{standing by at the}} Ambassador to ensure an accurate transcript of Nixon's remarks for the press, who would be facing deadlines in the East. Chotiner and Rogers would watch from behind a screen in the theatre; Pat Nixon, wearing a dress knitted by supporters, would sit on stage a few feet from her husband. The chosen set was a [...] "GI bedroom den" [...] with a desk, two chairs, and bookshelves. The senator usually preferred to work from a memorized text, but would work from notes for this speech to make the talk sound more spontaneous. Nixon spent some time practicing movements for the cameramen and finally went into the dressing room with his wife for a few minutes of solitude. He told her that he did not think he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> with it, but she reassured him.|$|E
500|$|James Newton Howard {{composed}} the score for Nightcrawler. Unlike {{the large and}} cinematic scores that had previously defined his career, Howard composed moody electronica pieces for Nightcrawler, heavily influenced by 1980s synth. Howard initially struggled writing a score that fit both the overall atmosphere of the film and Gilroy's expectations. Instead of using what Consequence of Sound described as [...] "the expected 10 strings and a nightmarish score", Gilroy wanted more uplifting and subversive music. The goal was for the audience {{to believe that the}} music is actually playing inside Lou's mind. For example, in the scene when Lou moves a dead body to get a better angle, the music sounds triumphant instead of dark, which is meant to convey how excited Lou is about the shot. Howard describes this as [...] "an anthem of potential for his tremendous success". For shots of Los Angeles, Howard used a subtle electronic sound, while shots with Lou used a more orchestral, clarinet driven sound. He believed that Lou <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> difficult situations easily and with a certain intelligence, and that orchestral music would best suit Lou.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Canada he {{continued}} {{to serve in the}} Algonquin Regiment militia as a non-permanent active member. [...] Following in his father's and grandfather's footsteps, he was elected chief of the Parry Island Band from February 1921. [...] Once in office he caused a schism in the band after he wrote a letter calling for certain individuals and those of mixed race to be expelled from the reserve. [...] He was re-elected in 1924 and served until he was deposed via an internal power struggle in April 1925. [...] Before the motion <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>through,</b> Pegahmagabow resigned. [...] A decade later, he was appointed councillor from 1933 to 1936. [...] In 1933 the Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) changed its policies and forbade First Nation chiefs from corresponding with the DIA. [...] They directed that all correspondence, as of the spring of 1933, go through the Indian Agent. [...] This gave huge power to the Agent, something that grated on Pegahmagabow, who did not get along with his Indian Agent, John Daly. [...] First Nation members who served in the army during World War I were particularly active as political activists. [...] They had travelled the world, earned the respect of the comrades in the trenches, and refused to be sidelined by the newly empowered Indian Agent. [...] Historian Paul Williams termed these advocates [...] "returned soldier chiefs", and singled out a few, including Pegahmagabow, as being especially active. [...] This caused intense disagreements with Daly and eventually led to Pegahmagabow being deposed as chief. [...] Daly and other agents who came in contact with Pegahmagabow were incredibly frustrated by his attempts, in his words, to free his people from [...] "white slavery". [...] The Indian agents labelled him a [...] "mental case" [...] and strove to sideline him and his supporters.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{limitations}} of the knee brace, Goebel led the Wolverines to victory in the first game played at Ohio Stadium. The official [...] "Dedication Day" [...] for the stadium was October 21, 1922, and the opponent was Michigan. Ohio State fans recalled for years afterward how Goebel and his teammate Harry Kipke managed to turn Dedication Day sour for the Buckeyes. Michigan shut out the Buckeyes, 19–0, with Goebel and Kipke scoring all the points. In the first period, Goebel blocked a punt and then kicked a long field goal from the 30-yard line for the game's first points. He also penetrated into the Ohio State backfield in the second quarter to recover a fumble. As the game wore on, the Buckeyes [...] "seemed to realize (Goebel's) importance in the Michigan lineup because he was forced to take plenty of punishment." [...] Football writer Billy Evans described Goebel's performance against Ohio State this way: [...] "No end in recent years has played a greater game (than) that which Goebel put up against Ohio State. For three periods Goebel was the mainspring of the Michigan eleven. He seemed to be in every play. It was always Goebel who was gumming things up for State. No man <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> an entire game at the speed with which Goebel played in the first three quarters. It was beyond the power of any human being. With a few minutes to play in the third period the big fellow practically collapsed. Even when three or four of his teammates were carrying him off the field the old spirit was still there. He tried to induce his teammates {{that he was able to}} play, and tried to break away from their grasp, but the punch was gone and he was forced to give way as the big crowd cheered him to the echo. If any one man made possible the defeat of State by Michigan, it was Captain Paul Goebel." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{success in}} local cricket within Yorkshire, Appleyard was engaged {{by the county}} in 1950 {{at the age of}} 26 and played three games for them, taking six wickets in two County Championship games against Surrey and Gloucestershire. With Alec Coxon departing for league cricket and Brian Close on {{military}} service, it was thought that Yorkshire would have an ordinary season in 1951, yet Appleyard's bowling, which saw him take the first 200-wicket aggregate for four years, ensured they remained {{near the top of the}} table. (In 2001, on the death of Alf Gover, Appleyard became the sole survivor among the twenty-eight bowlers who have taken 200 wickets or more in an English cricket season, the last case of which was Tony Lock in 1957.) [...] His wickets in the 1951 season cost an average of 14 a piece. Appleyard was able to bowl both as a paceman and as a spinner with no apparent changes of action, so that he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> an innings with little rest and possess sting under all conditions of weather and wicket.
