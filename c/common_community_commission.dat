25|$|A bi-communitarian public authority, the <b>Common</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (French: Commission communautaire commune, COCOM, Dutch: Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie, GGC) also exists. Its {{assembly}} {{is composed}} {{of the members of}} the regional parliament, and its board are the ministers – not the secretaries of state – of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote. This Commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact by-laws. In another capacity, it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare powers of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the French Community and the Flemish Community can exercise powers in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (for example, a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel). The <b>Common</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> is responsible for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (for example, the centres for social welfare of the 19 municipalities). Its ordinances have to be enacted with a majority in both linguistic groups. Failing such a majority, a new vote can be held, where a majority of at least one third in each linguistic group is sufficient.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to these two, a <b>Common</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> exists which is the entity when the Brussels-Capital Region exercises community powers. In these cases, there are more requirements for the legislative process in order to safeguard the interests of both linguistic communities (de facto the Flemish community).|$|E
50|$|In the Brussels region, {{there is}} another form of {{intermediate}} government, constituted by institutions {{from each of the}} two competent communities. Those institutions (COCOF for the French-speakers and VGC for the Flemings) have similar competencies, although only COCOF has legislative powers, given by the French Community. For Brussels community matters common to both communities there is a <b>Common</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Minister-President of the Brussels Capital-Region (Région de Bruxelles-Capitale, Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest) is {{the person}} leading the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region. The post is {{appointed}} for 5 years along with 4 ministers and 3 [...] "state" [...] secretaries.

25|$|The French <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> {{has also}} another capacity: some {{legislative}} {{powers of the}} French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (for the bilingual language area). The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community. This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, the French <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> can enact decrees, which are legislative acts.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Common</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (Commission communautaire commune, Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie) is {{responsible}} for Brussels community matters that are common to both the French Community and the Flemish Community and for institutions that fall within the competencies of the Communities but do not belong exclusively to either Community in the Brussels-Capital Region of Belgium. Examples of this include the bilingual hospitals in the Brussels Region.|$|E
5000|$|Ordinance (Ordonnantie, ordonnance) in Belgium {{refers to}} {{legislation}} {{passed by the}} Brussels Parliament in exercise of its regional competences and by the United Assembly of the <b>Common</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission.</b> In principle, ordinances have the same legal force as laws and decrees, but the Federal Government {{has the authority to}} suspend ordinances if, in its view, it could jeopardise the role of Brussels as the capital of Belgium or the international role of Brussels, sometimes seen as the [...] "capital of the European Union".|$|E
50|$|Chapter V, {{which is}} titled The Constitutional Court, {{conflict}} prevention and resolution, contains the Articles 141 to 143. It {{is divided into}} three sections, each of which contains only one article: Section I on the prevention of competency conflicts, Section II on the Constitutional Court and Section III on the prevention and resolution of conflicts of interest. Article 143 determines that the federal State, the Communities, the Regions and the <b>Common</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission,</b> in the exercise of their respective competences, must observe the federal loyalty.|$|E
50|$|It {{does not}} have {{legislative}} power contrary {{to the other two}} <b>community</b> <b>commissions.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Within this mainly French {{speaking}} region, {{nearly all}} former provincial competencies are assumed by its regional institutions {{and by the}} French Community Commission, the Flemish Community Commission or the <b>Common</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission.</b> However, the Arrondissement of Brussels-Capital has two commissioners of the Federal Government who are called [...] "Governor of the Brussels-Capital Region" [...] and [...] "Vice-Governor". The Governor exercises most {{of the few remaining}} powers elsewhere exercised by a provincial governor, particularly in the field of public order, as far as no (federal) law, (regional) decree, ordinance or decision states otherwise.|$|E
50|$|A bi-communitarian public authority, the <b>Common</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (French: Commission communautaire commune, COCOM, Dutch: Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie, GGC) also exists.

50|$|The 89 {{members of}} the Brussels Parliament are divided into two {{language}} groups: 72 belong to the French-speaking group and 17 members belong to the Dutch-speaking group. The {{members of the}} French-speaking group also make up the Parlement francophone bruxellois (in English: Francophone Brussels Parliament), which was {{formerly known as the}} Assembly of the French Community Commission, while the members of the Dutch-speaking group make up the Council of the Flemish Community Commission. The Parlement francophone bruxellois and the Council of the Flemish Community Commission together form the United Assembly of the <b>Common</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission.</b> The Community Commissions are to a certain extent responsible for Community competencies within the Brussels-Capital Region.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Common</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> is {{composed}} of a council, the United Assembly, and an executive, the United College. The United Assembly consists {{of the members of}} both the Council of the Flemish Community Commission and the Assembly of the French Community Commission, and is equal to the membership of the Brussels Parliament (which is a regional, rather than a community parliament). The United College comprises all members of the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region, except the Secretaries of State. The United College is presided over by the Minister-President of the Brussels Region, who only has an advisory vote. As a result, there are two French-speaking and two Flemish members with the right to vote.|$|E
50|$|Chapter VIII, {{the last}} chapter of Title III of the Constitution, is titled The provincial and {{municipal}} institutions. As its title suggests, this chapter describes the organisation of {{the institutions of the}} provinces and the municipalities of Belgium. It contains the Articles 162 to 166. Article 162 establishes the principles of the organisation of the provincial and municipal institutions, such as the direct election {{of the members of the}} provincial and the municipal councils. Article 163 stipulates that the functions of the provincial organs are exercised in the extraprovincial Brussels-Capital Region by the institutions of the Flemish Community, the French Community, the <b>Common</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> and the Region. Article 165 provides that the law can create agglomerations and federations of municipalities. It also describes the functioning of theseagglomerations and federations. Article 166 describes how the preceding article applies to the municipalities of the Brussels Region.|$|E

The Flemish <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (VGC) and the French <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (COCOF) were to act on their respective Communities' behalf in Brussels. Brussels divides its funding for the Communities between them, with 20% going to the VGC, and 80% to the COCOF.|$|R
