5|$|Aposematism is {{exploited}} in Müllerian mimicry, where {{species with}} strong defences evolve to resemble one another. By mimicking similarly coloured species, the warning signal to predators is shared, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> learn more quickly at {{less of a}} cost {{to each of the}} species.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), {{sometimes}} referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas (MIG) welding or metal active gas (MAG) welding, is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable wire electrode and the workpiece metal(s), which heats the workpiece metal(s), <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> melt and join.|$|E

5|$|The {{more massive}} the star, the shorter its lifespan, {{primarily}} because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last {{an average of}} a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to {{hundreds of billions of}} years.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial by}} ducking (immersing the accused, bound, in water, {{to see if}} she would float) appears to have been used only once in Virginia, to try Sherwood. It was {{believed}} that, as water was considered pure, it would reject witches, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> float, whereas the innocent would sink.|$|E
5|$|To combat {{pathogens}} that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens to link them together, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> agglutinate. Since an antibody has {{at least}} two paratopes, it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.|$|E

5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> eat faster and consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. Compared to modern wolves, the high frequency of tooth fracture in Beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due to higher carnivore density and increased competition.|$|E
5|$|A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a {{merchant}} ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized bulk carrier {{was built in}} 1852, economic forces have fuelled {{the development of these}} ships, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> grow in size and sophistication. Today's bulkers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, efficiency, and durability.|$|E
5|$|A {{nematode}} (Myrmeconema neotropicum) that infects canopy ants (Cephalotes atratus) {{causes the}} black-coloured gasters of workers to turn red. The parasite also alters the behaviour of the ant, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> carry their gasters high. The conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by birds for ripe fruits, such as Hyeronima alchorneoides, and eaten. The droppings {{of the bird}} are collected by other ants and fed to their young, leading to further spread of the nematode.|$|E

5|$|After Tod dies in a freak freak accident, {{they go to}} {{the morgue}} to see his body and find {{mortician}} William Bludworth. Bludworth explains to them Death's design and that they're still in danger. Realizing this, they attempt to rescue the remaining survivors. Following Terry's and Ms. Lewton's deaths, they are successful in saving Carter's life. Unfortunately, only seconds later Billy dies, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> realize that if they intervene in someone's death they can save them. Believing himself to be next, Alex withdraws from the group.|$|E
5|$|Ancient stone {{structures}} {{testify to}} the presence of Stroma's earliest residents, while a Norse presence around 900–1,000 years ago is recorded in the Orkneyinga Saga. It has been politically united with Caithness since at least the 15th century. Although Stroma lies only a few miles off the Scottish coast, the savage weather and ferociously strong tides of the Pentland Firth meant that the island's inhabitants were very isolated, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be largely self-sufficient, trading agricultural produce and fish with the mainlanders.|$|E
5|$|Clavaria zollingeri {{contains}} lectins, a {{class of}} proteins that bind specific carbohydrates {{on the surface of}} cells, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> clump together. A Korean study demonstrated that extracts of the fungus caused lymphoagglutination, a specific form of agglutination that involves white blood cells. In general, lectins are used in blood typing and serology, and they are widely used in affinity chromatography for purifying proteins.|$|E

5|$|Computers may be {{impacted}} by volcanic ash, with their functionality and usability decreasing during ashfall, {{but it is}} unlikely they will completely fail. The most vulnerable components are the mechanical components, such as cooling fans, cd drives, keyboard, mice and touch pads. These components can become jammed with fine grained ash <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> cease working; however, most can be restored to working order by cleaning with compressed air. Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the novels}} Halo: Fall of Reach and Halo: The Flood, it is {{told that the}} Grunts are methane {{breathers}} and described as dog-like. They have methane suits {{that allow them to}} remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|E
5|$|The {{build-up}} {{of toxins}} and pollutants in seabirds {{is also a}} concern. Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from the ravages of DDT until it was banned; among other effects, DDT was implicated in embryo development problems and the skewed sex ratio of western gulls in southern California. Oil spills are also a threat to seabird species, as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated by the oil, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> lose their waterproofing. Oil pollution threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations.|$|E

5|$|All {{dates of}} the dollar also exist in proof finish. The 1999 coins were sold as {{standalone}} proof strikes, rather than {{as part of a}} larger proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered. The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which was applied to the coinage dies with a different punch, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> have a more legible appearance. They are considered scarce and are valued considerably higher than normal proofs of the series.|$|E
