40|$|The {{free radical}} molecule, nitric oxide (NO), {{is present in}} the {{principal}} organs of plants, where it {{plays an important role in}} a wide range of physiological functions. Root growth and development are highly regulated by both internal and external factors such as nutrient availability, hormones, pattern formation, cell polarity and cell cycle control. The presence of NO in roots has opened up new areas of research on the role of NO, including root architecture, nutrient acquisition, microorganism interactions and the response mechanisms to adverse environmental conditions, among others. Additionally, the exogenous application of NO throughout the roots has the potential to counteract specific damages caused by certain stresses. This review aims to provide an up-to-date perspective on NO functions in the roots of higher plants.

40|$|In drupe-type fruits, pit hardening, {{resulting}} from sclerification {{of the fruit}} endocarp, is widely used as a phenological marker for both physiological studies and orchard management. In spite {{of the importance of}} pit hardening for understanding fruit development processes and for agricultural practices, however, its quantification has remained obscure and precision has been lost with time and lax usage. In this study, we used a mechanical device to measure the physical pressure required to break the olive pit in order to define the timing of pit hardening more precisely and to permit closer observation of its relationship to fruit and endocarp growth and development. Over 4 years we found that pit-hardening pressure increased following a sigmoid pattern, at first gradually but then with a large and rapid increment of change in {{a relatively short period of}} time. The rapid acceleration of hardening began at the time when pit longitudinal and transverse diameters attained their maximum size. That timing is consistent with the anatomical differentiation of the sclerified endocarp cells which can no longer expand nor divide. The results improve our knowledge of pit hardening and provide a more precise context for evaluating the metabolic costs, physiological interactions and genetic controls of stone fruit endocarp development. On a practical level, the association of the intensification of pit-breaking pressure with the cessation of pit expansion indicates that pit diameters can be useful morphological markers to identify the onset of this period. © 2013 Association of Applied Biologists.

40|$|Bruising, {{damage caused}} by impact on the fruit during harvesting, is a major {{limiting}} factor {{in the production of}} table olives and currently restricts the applicability of mechanical harvesting. Bruising is characterized by darkening of the olive fruit surface and softening of the mesocarp or pulp. It decreases final product quality and may cause consumer rejection. This paper describes and quantifies anatomical changes in the olive mesocarp (pulp) related to bruising in fresh olive fruits after an induced impact. The study assessed two harvested table olive cultivars differing in bruise susceptibility (‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’ and ‘Hojiblanca’) at two different times (4 and 24 h after induced impact). Qualitative observations of tissue bruising prior and after histological analysis revealed changes in the damaged mesocarp including ruptured cells, loss of cell wall thickness, and discoloration in the damaged areas. These changes appeared greater in ‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’ than ‘Hojiblanca’, and more evident 24 h after the impact. Bruising damage was quantified using eleven parameters related to the area of the damaged zone, and incidence and position of tissue ruptures. Nine of these parameters changed significantly with time, and significant differences were observed between the two cultivars studied in seven of the parameters. Three of these, the total damaged area (TDA) measured in mesocarp portions prior to histological procedure, the number of tissue ruptures in the mesocarp intersected by circumferential arc 2 (located at one-fourth of the pulp thickness from the fruit exterior; Brk-arc 2), and the distance from the fruit exterior) to the first found tissue rupture (D-min)), measured in histological preparations, were the most discriminating and easy to assess parameters, and are thus recommended for the evaluation of susceptibility to bruising among harvested table olive cultivars.

40|$|The timing, duration, and {{intensity}} of summer water restrictions differentially affect overall olive fruit growth and production, based on the underlying fruit developmental processes. For that, the fruit component and tissue morphogenetic response to different irrigation strategies during summer was examined in a hedgerow olive orchard cv. Arbequina. Control trees (CON) were irrigated to maintain the root zone close to field capacity throughout fruit growth. From budburst to 4 weeks after full bloom (WAFB) (Period 1) and from 14 WAFB to harvest (at 23 WAFB) (Period 4) trees of all treatments were irrigated as CON. Two severe water deficit treatments were applied during summer by irrigating 30 % CON from 4 to 9 WAFB (Period 2) in DI-P 2 or from 9 to 14 WAFB (Period 3) in DI-P 3. Moderate water deficit was applied in Periods 2 and 3 by irrigating 50 % CON in DI-P 2 & 3. Growth {{and development of the}} fruit and its component tissues (exocarp, mesocarp and endocarp), fruit composition, mesocarp cell area and cell number, and epidermal characteristics {{at the end of each}} period were evaluated. Water deficits significantly reduced fruit volume at the time when they were applied. Mesocarp size was more sensitive to water deficit than endocarp size and showed a high recovery capacity after rewatering. Although the majority of cells were developed in Period 1, a substantial number of mesocarp cells were also formed later. While mesocarp cell number was unaffected by water reduction in any of the deficit periods, cell size was highly affected but with high recoverability. Endocarp size was reduced when water restriction was applied in DI-P 2 and its effect continued until harvest. Fruit oil content at harvest was not significantly affected by the applied water restrictions, whereas water was the fruit component which most responded to both the increases and decreases in irrigation. Cuticle thickness, epidermal cell size and number at harvest appeared to respond to both irrigation regime and fruit expansion pressures. © 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In recent years, {{the study}} of nitric oxide (NO) in plant systems has {{attracted}} the attention of many researchers. A growing number of investigations have shown the significance of NO as a signal molecule or as a molecule involved in the response against (a) biotic processes. NO can be responsible of the post-translational modifications (NO-PTM) of target proteins by mechanisms such as the nitration of tyrosine residues. The study of protein tyrosine nitration during development and under biotic and adverse environmental conditions has increased in the last decade; nevertheless, there is also an endogenous nitration which seems to have regulatory functions. Moreover, the advance in proteome techniques has enabled the identification of new nitrated proteins, showing the high variability among plant organs, development stage and species. Finally, it may be important to discern between a widespread protein nitration because of greater RNS content, and the specific nitration of key targets which could affect cell-signaling processes. In view of the above point, we present a mini-review that offers an update about the endogenous protein tyrosine nitration, during plant development and under several abiotic stress conditions.

To compare the municipalities, we use difference in differences approach. The OLS regression is used for estimate the effect of own resources. The results show that size of municipalities' co-financing, usually mentioned as 10 %, is in fact in average 35 %. There exists a large significant difference in financial results comparing pre- treatment and post-treatment period in municipalities building waste water treatment project financed from Structural Funds.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{revealed}} the excellence of the westernmost Mediterranean records for reconstructing climate conditions {{over the last}} two millennia. In particular, inorganic and organic proxies have revealed a coherent signal of climate and oceanographic responses during this time. Here we compare and integrate both proxy records for reconstructing climate and oceanographic conditions with focus on the last millennium. The higher temperatures indicated by lipid-based proxies during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) are coincident with drier conditions indicated by inorganic proxies. In contrast, lower temperatures and humid conditions are indicated during the Little Ice Age (LIA). The industrial period was characterized by increasing humidity in comparison with the previous LIA. However, a progressive aridification occurred since {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, coexisting with a warming trend and higher contribution of C 3 grasses. Proxy records are also interpreted to show Atlantic water inflow at AD 1450 and 1950 and an intensification of the upwelling conditions coinciding with a prolonged positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase in the intervals AD 1000 – 1450 and 1960 – 1990. Large-scale oceanic–atmospheric circulation patterns (the NAO and the Atlantic meridional circulation) and solar irradiance variations seem to have played the major key role during the last millennium, together with anthropogenic contributions in the more recent record.

Using a hierarchical approach, 620 non-essential single-gene yeast deletants generated by EUROFAN I were systematically screened for cell-wall-related phenotypes. By analyzing for altered sensitivity {{to the presence of}} Calcofluor white or SDS in the growth medium, altered sensitivity to sonication, or abnormal morphology, 145 (23 %) mutants showing at least one cell wall-related phenotype were selected. These were screened further to identify genes potentially involved in either the biosynthesis, remodeling or coupling of cell wall macromolecules or genes involved in the overall regulation of cell wall construction and to eliminate those genes with a more general, pleiotropic effect. Ninety percent of the mutants selected from the primary tests showed additional cell wall-related phenotypes. When extrapolated to the entire yeast genome, these data indicate that over 1200 genes may directly or indirectly affect cell wall formation and its regulation. Twenty-one mutants with altered levels of β 1, 3 -glucan synthase activity and five Calcofluor white-resistant mutants with altered levels of chitin synthase activities were found, indicating that the corresponding genes affect β 1, 3 -glucan or chitin synthesis. By selecting for increased levels of specific cell wall components in the growth medium, we identified 13 genes that are possibly implicated in different steps of cell wall assembly. Furthermore, 14 mutants showed a constitutive activation of the cell wall integrity pathway, suggesting that they participate in the modulation of the pathway either directly acting as signaling components or by triggering the Slt 2 -dependent compensatory mechanism. In conclusion, our screening approach represents a comprehensive functional analysis on a genomic scale of gene products involved in various aspects of fungal cell wall formation.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is a {{biological}} messenger that orchestrates {{a plethora of}} plant functions, mainly through post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as S-nitrosylation or tyrosine nitration. In plants, hundreds of proteins {{have been identified as}} potential targets of these NO-PTMs under physiological and stress conditions indicating the relevance of NO in plant-signaling mechanisms. Among these NO protein targets, there are different antioxidant enzymes involved in the control of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H 2 O 2, which is also a signal molecule. This highlights the close relationship between ROS/NO signaling pathways. The major plant antioxidant enzymes, including catalase, superoxide dismutases (SODs) peroxiredoxins (Prx) and all the enzymatic components of the ascorbate-glutathione (Asa-GSH) cycle, {{have been shown to be}} modulated to different degrees by NO-PTMs. This mini-review will update the recent knowledge concerning the interaction of NO with these antioxidant enzymes, with a special focus on the components of the Asa-GSH cycle and their physiological relevance.

40|$|In {{the context}} of a severe {{economic}} crisis and austerity, new ideas were put forward to reform cohesion policy to enhance its effectiveness and the return on investment. Among them, financial engineering instruments, such as JESSICA, expected to offer a means to ‘do more with less’ in this difficult budgetary context. In the case of such instruments, EU funds are not offered as <b>grants</b> <b>co-financing</b> investment projects, but rather are used to provide repayable assistance to projects, a form of support. Such revolving funds approach is in stark contrast with the grant-based assistance typically offered as part of EU cohesion policy and was expected to increase the sustainability and effectiveness of interventions. But does it fulfil those expectations? This paper examines JESSICA through the conceptual lens of policy instruments literature. It verifies whether JESSICA is actually fit for its purpose of supporting sustainable urban development. It also gauges the impacts of instrument on the behaviour of the actors involved in its implementation at the sub-national level. The findings indicate that JESSICA is a flawed and overly complex instrument that instead of doing ‘more with less’ only allows for achieving ‘less with less’. However, it still exerts a positive influence on the sub-national authorities involved by promoting cross-sectoral interactions and facilitating learning. It also promotes a change in the approach to EU cohesion policy and public investment more generally, putting more emphasis on economic viability of investment.

As an application example in a more complex sample, a lactose isomerization mixture containing in addition lactulose and monosaccharides was enriched in this ketose by using [EMIM][DCA]. Carbohydrates were then successfully recovered from the ionic liquid following an activated charcoal-based treatment. Overall, lactulose content was enriched from a 24 % in the initial isomerization reaction mixture to a 62 % in the purified sample. These experimental results demonstrated the potential of ionic liquids as green alternative solvents for the selective fractionation of bioactive ketoses from their corresponding aldoses in food and beverage production.

40|$|Trabajo presentado al CVPR celebrado en Providence (USA) del 16 al 21 de junio de 2012. Markerless 3 D human pose {{detection}} from {{a single}} image is a severely underconstrained problem because different 3 D poses can have similar image projections. In order to handle this ambiguity, current approaches rely on prior shape models {{that can only be}} correctly adjusted if 2 D image features are accurately detected. Unfortunately, although current 2 D part detector algorithms have shown promising results, they are not yet accurate enough to guarantee a complete disambiguation of the 3 D inferred shape. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for estimating 3 D human pose even when observations are noisy. We propose a stochastic sampling strategy to propagate the noise from the image plane to the shape space. This provides a set of ambiguous 3 D shapes, which are virtually undistinguishable from their image projections. Disambiguation is then achieved by imposing kinematic constraints that guarantee the resulting pose resembles a 3 D human shape. We validate the method on a variety of situations in which state-of-the-art 2 D detectors yield either inaccurate estimations or partly miss some of the body parts.

Samples were examined by X-ray diffraction, micro-Raman spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy/X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy. Three types of rootsicle were defined: incipient; hard (white and red); and black spongy. The incipient rootsicles still contained rotten organic material {{and showed the}} beginning of mineralization by allophane. The white hard and black spongy types were also composed of allophane, while the red hard type was composed of hydrous ferric oxi-hydroxide minerals (HFO). The allophane and HFO in the andisol covering the cave roof precipitated out of the dripwater running along the roots to form the studied rootsicles. All three types of rootsicle showed black layers, coatings, spots or patches composed of manganese oxide minerals and, occasionally, hisingerite (iron (III) phyllosilicate). An alternation of organic precipitation caused by filamentous bacteria and inorganic precipitation (the latter facilitated by pH changes in the dripwater and the cave's temperature) built up both the porous and compact rings observed in the white and red hard rootsicles. The largely straight filaments seen in the porous rings of the white hard rootsicles may be indicative of the previous presence of Leptothrix spp., while the helical morphologies seen in the red hard rootsicles may be indicative of that of Gallionella spp. The manganese oxide minerals detected probably formed via microbial activity.

40|$|Linolenic acid (Ln) {{released}} from chloroplast membrane galactolipids is a precursor of the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA). The involvement of this hormone in different plant biological processes, such as responses to biotic stress conditions, {{has been extensively}} studied. However, the role of Ln in the regulation of gene expression during abiotic stress situations mediated by cellular redox changes and/or by oxidative stress processes remains poorly understood. An RNA-seq approach has increased {{our knowledge of the}} interplay among Ln, oxidative stress and ROS signaling that mediates abiotic stress conditions. Transcriptome analysis with the aid of RNA-seq in the absence of oxidative stress revealed that the incubation of Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension cultures (ACSC) with Ln resulted in the modulation of 7525 genes, of which 3034 genes had a 2 -fold-change, being 533 up- and 2501 down-regulated genes, respectively. Thus, RNA-seq data analysis showed that an important set of these genes were associated with the jasmonic acid biosynthetic pathway including lypoxygenases (LOXs) and Allene oxide cyclases (AOCs). In addition, several transcription factor families involved in the response to biotic stress conditions (pathogen attacks or herbivore feeding), such as WRKY, JAZ, MYC, and LRR were also modified in response to Ln. However, this study also shows that Ln has the capacity to modulate the expression of genes involved in the response to abiotic stress conditions, particularly those mediated by ROS signaling. In this regard, we were able to identify new targets such as galactinol synthase 1 (GOLS 1), methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) and alkenal reductase in ACSC. It is therefore possible to suggest that, {{in the absence of any}} oxidative stress, Ln is capable of modulating new sets of genes involved in the signaling mechanism mediated by additional abiotic stresses (salinity, UV and high light intensity) and especially in stresses mediated by ROS.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} {{the influence of the}} addition of organic inerts such as charcoal with a well-controlled particle size on the development of fluidity in three coking coals of different rank, maceral composition, and rheological properties. Three size fractions of charcoal, < 20, 20 – 80, and 80 – 212 μm, that can be considered as artificially prepared inertinites were used. The different charcoal fractions were added in amounts of 2, 5, 10, and 15 wt. % to selected high-quality coking coals with a Gieseler maximum fluidity (Fmax) of 373 (LF), 541 (MF), and 1891 (HF) ddpm. Increasing the amount of charcoal in the blend led to a progressive inverse exponential reduction in fluidity. This reduction was accompanied by a shortening of the fluid interval due to an increase in the softening temperature. In the case of the finest charcoal fraction, the inhibition of fluidity was even more pronounced. The HF coal with a relatively high fluidity was very sensitive to minimum amounts of charcoal addition, losing nearly half of its fluidity when 5 wt. % charcoal was added. A similar reduction in Fmax was also observed for LF, while MF with only a slightly higher fluidity displayed a different trend. From the results {{it can be seen that}} the inherent characteristics of a coal are critical factors that affect the extent of the reduction in fluidity caused by the incorporation of charcoal. The differences can be partially attributed to the amount of inertinite present in the parent coal and to the macerals within the inertinite, especially fusinite, semifusinite, and inertodetrinite. In relation to petrographic changes in the matrix of the semicokes, there is a general trend for isotropic material to increase and the size of the anisotropic textures to decrease with the addition of charcoal. Inclusions within the semicoke matrix also change according to the amount and the size of the charcoal added to coal.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Biologia (Genética), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2009 A {{continuing}} {{challenge in}} evolutionary biology {{is to understand}} the processes by which populations become genetically distinct. In general, genetic drift and local adaptation are counteracted by the unifying effects of gene flow. In many marine organisms, gene flow is high due to a planktonic life stage that can result in movement over large distances. The combination of high dispersal and few barriers to larval movement presents a challenge for understanding how divergence occurs in marine environments. Although the predominant mechanisms leading to population differentiation are not always clear, several factors may be important either singly or in combination, including limited dispersal ability, local adaptation, oceanographic currents, habitat discontinuities, isolation-by-distance and historic vicariance. Here it is focused the impact of biogeographic barriers, geographical distance and habitat discontinuities on genetic differentiation in marine organisms. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the influence of biogeography, oceanography and ecology on the population structure and morphology of different crustacean and gastropod species with emphasis on their larval development and distribution along a latitudinal gradient. It is predicted that the duration of larval development influences the dispersal capability and therefore the level of genetic differentiation. These results provide evidence that dispersal play an important role in determining the genetic structure of a species, but the biogeographic history and physical and environmental factors have also a considered influence on it. Thus, adaptive plasticity could also be an explanation for variability. This study also contributes to future studies on morphometric investigations. The results suggest that in studies of morphological population differentiation on crustaceans, the right chela is more suitable to use in homochelous crabs. If the crab is heterochelous, the male major chela and the female right chela should be used. The results also indicate that geometric morphometrics yields stronger evidence of morphological differences among forms, suggesting that this method may be more suitable for analysis of body shape.

[Introduction]: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells capable of self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. Their multipotential capacity and immunomodulatory properties have led to an increasing interest in their biological properties and therapeutic applications. Currently, the definition of MSCs relies on a combination of phenotypic, morphological and functional characteristics which are typically evaluated upon in vitro expansion, a process that may ultimately lead to modulation of the immunophenotypic, functional and/or genetic features of these cells. Therefore, at present there is great interest in providing markers and phenotypes for direct in vivo and ex vivo identification and isolation of MSCs. [Methods]: Multiparameter flow cytometry immunophenotypic studies were performed on 65 bone marrow (BM) samples for characterization of CD 13 high CD 105 + CD 45 – cells. Isolation and expansion of these cells was performed in a subset of samples in parallel to the expansion of MSCs from mononuclear cells following currently established procedures. The protein expression profile of these cells was further assessed on (paired) primary and in vitro expanded BM MSCs, and their adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential was also determined. [Results]: Our results show that the CD 13 high CD 105 + CD 45 − immunophenotype defines a minor subset of cells that are systematically present ex vivo in normal/reactive BM (n = 65) and that display immunophenotypic features, plastic adherence ability, and osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation capacities fully compatible with those of MSCs. In addition, we also show that in vitro expansion of these cells modulates their immunophenotypic characteristics, including changes in the expression of markers currently used for the definition of MSCs, such as CD 105, CD 146 and HLA-DR. [Conclusions]: BM MSCs can be identified ex vivo in normal/reactive BM, based on a robust CD 13 high CD 105 + and CD 45 − immunophenotypic profile. Furthermore, in vitro expansion of these cells is associated with significant changes in the immunophenotypic profile of MSCs.

We exploit the first public data release of VIPERS to investigate environmental effects in the evolution of galaxies between z ~ 0. 5 and 0. 9. The large number of spectroscopic redshifts (more than 50 000) over an area of about 10 deg 2 provides a galaxy sample with high statistical power. The accurate redshift measurements (σz = 0. 00047 (1 + zspec)) allow us to robustly isolate galaxies living in the lowest and highest density environments (δ 4, respectively) as defined in terms of spatial 3 D density contrast δ. We estimate the stellar mass function of galaxies residing in these two environments and constrain the high-mass end (ℳ ≳ 1011 ℳ⊙) with unprecedented precision. We find that the galaxy stellar mass function in the densest regions has a different shape than was measured at low densities, with an enhancement of massive galaxies and a hint of a flatter (less negative) slope at z< 0. 8. We normalise each mass function to the comoving volume occupied by the corresponding environment and relate estimates from different redshift bins. We observe an evolution of the stellar mass function of VIPERS galaxies in high densities, while the low-density one is nearly constant. We compare these results to semi-analytical models and find consistent environmental signatures in the simulated stellar mass functions. We discuss how the halo mass function and fraction of central/satellite galaxies depend on the environments considered, making intrinsic and environmental properties of galaxies physically coupled, hence difficult to disentangle. The evolution of our low-density regions is described well by the formalism introduced by Peng et al. (2010, ApJ, 721, 193), and is consistent with the idea that galaxies become progressively passive because of internal physical processes. The same formalism could also describe the evolution of the mass function in the high density regions, but only if a significant contribution from dry mergers is considered.

40|$|As {{children}} grow up, they expand their territorial range (Andrews, 1973). This increasing autonomy allows them for reaching new places of activities, thereby attaining further developmental tasks. However, less {{is known about}} what children and adolescents do that makes them familiar with an increasing area. Various means such as walking, riding a bicycle, taking a bus or getting a lift by car differ in the mobility and the knowledge about the environment they provide (Rissotto & Tonucci, 2002) and in the motor, perceptual, and cognitive skills required to use them. Thus, these means of transportation may not only be tools for autonomy development, but becoming able to use them might {{be a part of}} autonomy development (Bullens et al., 2010). Thus, the frequencies of walking, riding a bicycle or a bus, and of being given a lift by the parents, will be explored in two domains: transportation to school and to spare-time activities. The former focuses on the use of means of transportation to a mandatory destination whereas the latter explores the twofold autonomy to make use of a means of transportation and to access targets which might change with age. A total of 715 children (54. 4 % girls) attending grades 4, 6, and 9 (ages 10, 12, and 15) and 497 parents of children (51. 5 % girls) attending grades 2, 4, and 6 (ages 8, 10, and 12) filled out questionnaires. Both parents and children indicated on how many days of the week the child walked, cycled, took the bus, and was driven to school and to free-time activities, respectively. Multilevel analyses were used because participants were nested in 16 schools which were nested in 6 municipalities in adjacent regions of Denmark and Southern Sweden. Predictor variables were grade, gender (dummy-coded), and distance to school (four categories, recoded to approximate kilometers). In the next step, country was added into equations, in order to explain part of the variance between municipalities. Finally, theoretically meaningful interactions between grade, gender, and distance from school were added. The final model for each dependent variable was the one with the best fit (AIC, BIC). Variables had been transformed to approach normal distribution. Walking and riding the bicycle (especially in girls) were mainly used for shorter distances. In contrast, bus and the family car were used for more distant destinations. Danish children used more active, individual ways of transportation whereas Swedish children used public transport. Girls tended to use more passive means such as being driven by car or riding the bus whereas boys, at least at certain ages, walked more or rode their bicycles. Although age effects were similar on a global level, such as that children depended less of their parents’ help to get somewhere, details differed. The youngest children did not any longer need the car ride to school, but it were the oldest ones who did not any longer get lifts to spare-time activities nearby. Thus, age trends in how to get to school did not explain age trends in accessing spare-time activities. On the contrary, when controlling for getting lifts to school, the absence of net age effects in parent-reported car rides {{turned out to be the}} sum of the opposite trends towards independence from parents and towards having more destinations to reach. The results show that children choose varying means of transportation according to their development of needs and skills. The differences between the age trends for the two types of destinations suggest a larger flexibility than known previously. Still, gender and cultural differences affect this facet of autonomy development.

We present the first Public Data Release (PDR- 1) of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Survey (VIPERS). It comprises 57 204 spectroscopic measurements together with all additional information necessary for optimal scientific exploitation of the data, in particular the associated photometric measurements and quantification of the photometric and survey completeness. VIPERS is an ESO Large Programme designed to build a spectroscopic sample of ≃ 100 000 galaxies with iAB < 22. 5 and 0. 5 <z < 1. 2 with high sampling rate (≃ 45 %). The survey spectroscopic targets are selected from the CFHTLS-Wide five-band catalogues in the W 1 and W 4 fields. The final survey will cover a total area of nearly 24 deg 2, for a total comoving volume between z = 0. 5 and 1. 2 of ≃ 4 × 107 h- 3 Mpc 3 and a median galaxy redshift of z ≃ 0. 8. The release {{presented in this paper}} includes data from virtually the entire W 4 field and nearly half of the W 1 area, thus representing 64 % of the final dataset. We provide a detailed description of sample selection, observations and data reduction procedures; we summarise the global properties of the spectroscopic catalogue and explain the associated data products and their use, and provide all the details for accessing the data through the survey database ([URL] where all information can be queried interactively.
