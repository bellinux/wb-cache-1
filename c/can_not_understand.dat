The tradition says that without Mary you <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the Trinity since {{it was she who}} bore the Son. A tradition going back to 14th century France added onto the earlier belief that they also represented faith, wisdom and chivalry. Alternatively, the cord can be seen as representing the one Divine Substance (godhood) of the three Persons, which binds Them together.|$|E
500|$|The video premiered on MTV and BET in September 1997 and {{was shot}} in [...] Puerto Rico on July 26, 1997. The video begins with Carey, playing as [...] "Agent M," [...] being held hostage in a large mansion. The captors are played by Eddie Griffin, Frank Sivero, and Johnny Brennan of The Jerky Boys, who {{continue}} to taunt Carey over her capture and eventual death. [...] "Agent M" [...] speaks in Spanish to the captors, saying she <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> them. After a series of dialogue, Carey escapes her Griffin's character and dives into a swimming pool from the mansion's roof. After an ensemble change, Carey dons a swimsuit and escapes the island via a watercraft. The video's antagonists continue their pursuit of Carey throughout {{a large body of}} water, until she arrives aboard a large ship. It is unclear if both scenes are happening separately or side by side. Throughout most of the video, Carey is seen posing on a large sailboat, while wearing a white bikini. After boarding the ship, Carey begins dancing and is soon joined by a group of male sailors. After a sequence of dance light dance routines, Carey is seen on an island with her lover, male model David Fumero, and her real life dog, Jack. They frolic together on the island, while Carey happily enjoys her romance.|$|E

2500|$|Death is that {{possibility}} {{which is the}} absolute impossibility of Dasein. As such, it cannot be compared to {{any other kind of}} ending or [...] "running out" [...] of something. For example, one's death is not an empirical event. For Heidegger, death is Daseins ownmost (it is what makes Dasein individual), it is non-relational (nobody can take one's death away from one, or die in one's place, and we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> our own death through the death of other Dasein), and it is not to be outstripped. The [...] "not-yet" [...] of life is always already a part of Dasein: [...] "as soon as man comes to life, he is at once old enough to die." [...] The threefold condition of death is thus simultaneously one's [...] "ownmost potentiality-for-being, non-relational, and not to be out-stripped". Death is determinate in its inevitability, but an authentic Being-toward-death understands the indeterminate nature of one's own inevitable death — one never knows when or how it is going to come. However, this indeterminacy does not put death in some distant, futural [...] "not-yet"; authentic Being-toward-death understands one's individual death as always already a part of one.|$|E

Police boats are on patrol duty about us all the time, and it is as much as a sailor's liberty is worth to show himself in a red shirt. These policemen follow the executive officer's boat from shore to ship and from ship to shore and watch his dark maneuvres with a vigilant eye. They will arrest him yet unless he assumes an expression of countenance that shall have less of carnage, insurrection and sedition in it. A visit paid in a friendly way to General Garibaldi yesterday (by cordial invitation,) by some of our passengers, has gone far to confirm the dread suspicions the government harbors toward us.

60|$|There {{are some}} {{advantages}} {{in each of}} these modes. Much depends on the age of the children, and still more upon the facilities which the father or mother have at hand for making entries in writing. To a man of business, accustomed to accounts, who could have a book made small enough to go into his wallet, or to a mother who is systematic in her habits, and has in her work-table or her secretary facilities for writing at any time, the plan of opening an account will be found much the best. It will afford an opportunity of giving the children a great deal of useful knowledge in respect to account-keeping--or, rather, by habituating them from an early age to the management of their affairs in this systematic manner, will train them from the beginning to habits of system and exactness. A very perceptible effect in this direction will be produced on the minds of children, even while they have not yet learned to read, and so <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> at all the written record made of their pecuniary transactions. They will, at any rate, understand that a written record is made; they will take a certain pride and pleasure in it, and impressions will be produced which may have an effect upon their habits of accuracy and system in their pecuniary transactions through all future life.|$|E

Believing himself a faithful servant of that Power, and asking daily for its interposition for promotion of a highly moral purpose, why should he not have expected his favor to the enterprise? To expect that was, in Mr. Sheldon, natural, reasonable, wise; his folly lay in believing in conditions making it expectable. A person convinced that the law of gravitation is suspended is no fool for walking into a bog.
