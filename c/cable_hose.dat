Assembly simulation, as well as many other processes, are used systematically even before the first physical prototype of a vehicle is built in order to check whether particular components can be assembled easily or whether another part is in the way. Usually, this kind of simulation is limited to rigid bodies. However, a vehicle contains a multitude of flexible parts of various types: <b>cables,</b> <b>hoses,</b> carpets, seat surfaces, insulations, weatherstrips [...] .

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{how to do}} stability analysis, variation simulation and tolerance envelopes for deformable <b>cables</b> and <b>hoses.</b> In this way, the well-established methods for analyzing and minimizing the propagation of geometric variation are extended from rigid and sheet metal assemblies to large deformations of slender parts. This extension is highly motivated, not at least, by the increased amount of <b>cables</b> and <b>hoses</b> in electrified and hybrid solutions in the automotive industry. To secure the geometric correctness of the analysis, we use a nonlinear rod approach {{in the implementation of}} a simulation model of flexible cables that accounts for large deformations and supports a wide range of common cable clip types, cable joints and branches. A selection of measures and visualizations that reflect the spatial effects of geometric variation in deformable cables is incorporated in established variation analysis techniques. In particular, the concept of tolerance envelopes for rigid parts has been extended to also handle system of slender parts such as <b>cables</b> and <b>hoses.</b> This article extends previous research on robust design and variation simulation to cables subject to large deformations and has been successfully applied on two typical industrial cases: a wiring harness attached with various types of clips to a static surrounding and a cooler hose subjected to a high-frequency sampled engine motion...|$|R

40|$|Flexible, slender {{structures}} like <b>cables,</b> <b>hoses</b> or wires can {{be described}} by the geometrically exact Cosserat rod theory. Due to their complex multilayer structure, consisting of various materials, viscoplastic behavior has to be expected for cables under load. Classical experiments like uniaxial tension, torsion or three-point bending already show that the behavior of e. g. electric cables is viscoplastic. A suitable constitutive law for the observed load case is crucial for a realistic simulation of the deformation of a component. Consequently, this contribution aims at a viscoplastic constitutive law formulated {{in the terms of}} sectional quantities of Cosserat rods. Since the loading of cables in applications is in most cases not represented by these mostly uniaxial classical experiment s, but rather multiaxial, new experiments for cables have to be designed. They have to illustrate viscoplastic effects, enable access to (viscoplastic) material parameters and account for coupling effects between different deformation modes. This work focuses on the design of such experiments...|$|R

50|$|The process {{involves}} {{moving the}} strip past precision-profiled slotted tools made to an exact shape, or past plain cutting tools.

40|$|In industry, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} demand for using fast (i. e. real time) realistic simulation of slender flexible structures in software tools for CAD, digital mock-up and virtual assembly, which nowadays can only handle rigid geometries. Typical examples of such structures from automotive industry are <b>cables,</b> tubes and <b>hoses.</b> For slender one-dimensional deformable objects, the theory of Cosserat rods provides a suitable framework for physically correct simulation of deformations like stretching bending and twisting. The static equilibrium equations of such Cosserat models are given {{as a set of}} nonlinear differential equations, which are usually discretized with the Finite Element Method in computational mechanics. This discretization technique provides very accurate simulation results, but is, used in the standard way, computationally far too demanding for fast simulations with an interactive modification of the boundary conditions. The kinematics of Cosserat rods are closely related to the differential geometry of framed curves, whereby the strain measures of the rods corresponds to the differential invariants of the curves, like arc length or curvature. Therefore, ideas from the discrete differential geometry of framed curves are utilized to construct discrete Cosserat rods. This approach leads to qualitatively correct results, even for very coarse discretizations. Hence, {{only a small number of}} degrees of freedom are needed to generate moderately accurate results. This leads to fast computational performance, which makes the discrete Cosserat rod model suitable for interactive simulations. In our contribution, we present such a geometry based discretization approach for flexible one-dimensional structures, together with some application examples of assembly simulation of <b>cables</b> and <b>hoses</b> in automotive industry...|$|R
