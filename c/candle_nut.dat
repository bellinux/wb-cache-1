50|$|While {{many people}} believe that the act of giving gifts during Christmas became a {{tradition}} due to the biblical story about how the three wise men brought gifts of gold, myrrh, and frankincense to the baby Jesus, these gifts were not the first winter gifts given. In fact, gift giving during the winter is an ancient tradition that can even be traced to winter-solstice celebrations before the famous birth occurred. During the ancient ceremonies of Saturnalia, which were celebrated for seven days beginning on December 17, Romans believed that their generosity of trading gifts would bring them good fortune in the coming year. In the beginning, these gifts were very modest and included things like wax <b>candles,</b> fruits and <b>nuts,</b> inexpensive wine, and lamps that were tied with a bit of holly to signify the return of light that would come with the passing of the winter equinox. Children would receive small items like terra-cotta rings and tiny dolls made from dough. Later, however, the gifts became more elaborate items like silver and silver objects.|$|R

Before dying the threads are soaked in a bath of kemiri, <b>candle</b> <b>nut</b> oil, and wood ash to aid the take-up of the red dye, then hung up to dry in the sun. Ramseyer said that the yarn was left to soak for 42 days and then left to dry for the same time. Gillow states that this is {{repeated}} up to 12 times. The threads are wrapped around the dying frame and the pattern is tied into the bundles of thread to form a resist. The bound warp and weft threads are then sent out to the neighboring village of Bug-Bug to be dyed as indigo is forbidden {{to be used in}} Tenganan. [...] Once dyed indigo, the threads are put back on the frames and some of the ties are undone to allow the red component of the pattern to be developed. The indigo is also over-dyed by the red to give the characteristic dark rust-brown color. The warp is then laid out on the loom and the cloth is woven in a loose balanced weave. The pattern is carried by both the warp and the weft. Great precision is needed at all stages of the production. Using a pick the weaver adjust the weft with each pass of the shuttle to make sure the alignment of the pattern is precise.|$|E

40|$|Keywords: Ecosystem, Agroforestry, Imperata cylindrica, pioneer, mycorrhizae, inter-cropping, tree architecture, biomass, {{functional}} branching analysisConversion of an Imperata cylindrica ecosystem into an agroforestry ecosystem is {{a complex}} process. Integrated control of the I. cylindrica grass is needed in combination with planting deep-rooted pioneer tree species, a legume cover crop and annual food crops. I. cylindrica grasslands are generally poor in nutrients, {{but they are not}} necessarily poor from a soil biological perspective and may contain high densities of mycorrhizal spores. Experiments in the nursery and in the field were conducted to provide the knowledge needed to design and improve smallholder options for converting I. cylindrica grasslands into productive and sustainable agroforestry systems. Inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi (resting spores in 'Mycofer' belonging to Glomus manihotis, Glomus etunicatum, Gigaspora rosea and Acaulospora tuberculata), did not promote tree seedling growth in the nursery, but it leads to a significant increase in survival rate of the four tree species tested, once these were transplanted to the field. However, this rate increased by 6. 5 % only. Nursery inoculation of the trees did not have any positive effect on the subsequent growth of those trees that survived the critical early stage. There is no compelling need {{for the use of the}} inoculum of the type used in the nursery. The performance of three out of four selected tree species growing in the alang-alang grassland, and their capability to outshade the grass, mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King, Meliaceae), sungkai (Peronema canescens Jack., Verbenaceae) and <b>candle</b> <b>nut</b> (Aleurites moluccana (L.) Willd., Euphorbiaceae) made them most suitable to be planted in those useless lands. Breadfruit or sukun (Artocarpus altilis Fosberg, Moraceae) proved itself unsuitable for the harsh conditions of large parts of the I. cylindrica grasslands. It only performed well in specific sites. The field experiments showed no statistically significant differences in tree growth linked to the method used for initial alang-alang suppression. Ploughing, herbicide use or the simple 'pressing' method all proved acceptable as part of the overall system used. Spraying herbicide and ploughing are the most efficient methods to reduce alang-alang biomass. Pressing is the cheapest method to prepare acceptable tree growth, but is less attractive for inter-cropping. As a cover crop, able to outshade alang-alang after one year, to prevent its recovery and to improve soil fertility at the same time, Pueraria javanica (Leguminosae-Fabaceae) is a good option. An overall tree-LAI 1 and an overall rate of tree-shading 40 % are conditions for acceptable corn yields by inter-cropping in a matrix of diverse trees species. Mahogany and sungkai have a crown architecture and a root distribution apt to stimulate the establishment of an agroforestry system, because they are particularly suited to live together with annual plants. <b>Candle</b> <b>nut,</b> however, is more appropriate to reduce I. cylindrica grass by shading with its wide, dense hemispherical crown. Functional Branching Analysis (FBA) software can yield estimates of above ground biomass of mahogany and sungkai with an average standard deviation of 1 ± 0. 34. While conversion of alang-alang grasslands into more productive and sustainable land uses is technically feasible, a broader approach including household level livelihood options may be needed to better understand the structure of the incentives needed to achieve real-world impacts of this research...|$|E

In this regard the plant species for {{the experiment was}} Eucalyptus urophylla {{with respect to the}} growth of its seedlings. Further, this experiment was intended to evaluate the effect of activated charcoal to as added to the media of Eucalyptus urophylla seedlings on their growth, and to asses the role of activated charcoal in improving soilfertility. The media for the seedling growth consisted of top soil mixed with activated charcoal of either bamboo or candlenut, compost, and mycorrhiza. The mixture was manipulated into various compo­ sition and further regarded as a treatment. The media consisting of only topsoil was also used as a control. The parameters as observed were number of leaves, increase in height of Eucalyptus urophylla seedlings, weight and dry weight ofplant, weight of root portion infected by mycorrhiza, and weight ratio of the top to root portion of the plant (T/R ratio). Further, the analyses of nutrients in the media consisted of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg contents before and after experiment. Result showed that the media containing activated charcoal of bamboo are more preferable than that of candlenut, this is because the former media could stimulate the increase in the height of plant seedlings by 27 percent, enhance the additional number of leaves by 29, increase the T/R ratio by 28 percent, and provide better mycorrhyzza growth than the latter media (i. e. containing activated charcoal of candlenut). Further, when the media containing top soil and activated charcoal of bamboo were added with compost, it could stimulate the growth in 4. 8 times as much as height of E. urophylla plant...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} {{of medium}} density fiberboard (MDF) using dry forming process for interior purpose requires extensive amount of thermo-setting urea formaldehyde (UF) adhesive. Unfortunately, this adhesive brings about formaldehyde emission from the resulting MDF, which was potentially harmful to human beings. The use of activated charcoal can be effective to reduce such emission. As the relevance, this research aimed to investigate the effect of activated charcoal addition to the MDF pulp on formaldehyde emission from the MDF. The fibers for the MDF-mat forming were the pulp procured from the MDF factory, resulting from the thermo-mechanical pulping (TMP) conducted on the mixed mangium wood (Acacia mangium) and rubber wood (Hevea brasiliensis) in 3 : 1 (w/w) proportion, respectively.  Such mixed TMP pulping was also done in the factor y.  The bonding between TMP pulp fiber during mat forming was assisted {{by the use of}} UF adhesive.  Prior to the MDF mat forming, was added to the resulting TMP pulp-fibers activated charcoal in  various amount, 2 %, 4 % and 6 % based on fiber mass as well as based on UF adhesive mass.
