Corcovado is the one park in Costa Rica where all four Costa Rican monkey species can be found.

Deforestation, illegal pet-trading, and hunting are the main reasons for its threatened status.|$|E

On her return, Bright {{said that it was}} [...] "really exciting to be asked back", saying that it was [...] "nice to just slot back in", adding, [...] "I feel really lucky". Talking to Inside Soap's Allison Jones and Laura-Jayne Tyler, Bright said of her return, [...] "The door was always left open for Poppy, but it was a big surprise to be asked back so quickly. I thought it might be further down the track, so when my agent rang, I was like, 'Yes— no problem!'". Bright stated that [...] "fear crept over" [...] when she was filming her first scene since her departure, as it was without Babbington. She added that she felt [...] "safe working with Kylie", but felt that without her the audience might get to know Poppy better. In Poppy's return storyline on 12 June, she arrived back in Walford to help Tanya (Joyner) with Janine's (Brooks) wedding preparations. A spokesperson for the show claimed that Poppy had become [...] "a successful nail artist" [...] since her departure, but as Poppy's storylines progress that is revealed to be untrue; Poppy was trying to impress Tanya. Bright said in an Inside Soap interview of Poppy's storylines, [...] "I think her job in Walford is to keep things light, and right now Poppy's in a happy place. She'll carry on dipping in and out of storylines, but viewers <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more of her soon. I'm excited about that!". The magazine added that Poppy had made a [...] "welcome return". Poppy begins a new friendship with Alice (Banks), who was stated to be a replacement for Jodie. Bright said of this new friendship, [...] "They are polar opposites, but that works. I think Poppy almost mothers Alice by looking after her and giving her good advice. Or at least it's what Poppy thinks is good advice!".|$|E

[...] Olds observed, [...] "Trying to stop citizens from accessing the Internet is increasingly becoming like a little kid trying to stop the tide with a toy shovel and a bucket." [...] An editorial in the Pakistan-based newspaper the Express Tribune commented on the ban of Facebook, [...] "Many users of the social media website have put up their own pages expressing their admiration for the Holy Prophet — surely this is a better response. Furthermore, the said page is one of millions on Facebook and blocking it entirely means that millions of users in Pakistan will be unable to access a site which has become part of their daily life.

40|$|At the April 2003 {{meeting of}} the International Monetary and Financial Committees, {{it was decided to}} further {{encourage}} the contractual approach to smoothing the process of sovereign debt restructuring by encouraging the more widespread use of collective action clauses (CACs) in international bonds.

This paper reviews the developments leading up to that event, its implications, and prospects for the future. It asks whether we <b>can</b> <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> additional issuance by emerging markets of bonds featuring CACs, whether such a trend would in fact help {{to make the world a}} safer financial place, and what additional steps might be taken to further enhance modalities for crisis resolution. ...|$|R
