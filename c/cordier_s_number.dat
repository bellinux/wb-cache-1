25|$|The {{supremum}} of {{the sequence}} {ω(x,n)} is called the type. Almost all real <b>numbers</b> are <b>S</b> <b>numbers</b> of type 1, which is minimal for real <b>S</b> <b>numbers.</b> Almost all complex <b>numbers</b> are <b>S</b> <b>numbers</b> of type 1/2, which is also minimal. The claims of almost all numbers were conjectured by Mahler and in 1965 proved by Vladimir Sprindzhuk.|$|R
50|$|The {{worsted count}} {{was only a}} rough {{measurement}} and {{has been replaced by}} more exact methods such as the metric yarn count. However, for fine wool, the memory of the older system survives in the <b>S</b> <b>numbers</b> which have a very rough correspondence to worsted count. In other words, fiber that yielded about 80 worsted hanks is roughly comparable to fiber designated as 80s using the <b>S</b> <b>numbers.</b> The critical difference is that while the worsted number was an indirect measure (and a rough one at that) of yarn thickness, the <b>S</b> <b>number</b> is a direct (and precise) measurement of the thickness of the fiber. The <b>S</b> <b>number</b> of fiber, and hence of yarn, fabric, or garments made of that fiber, is determined using the international standard promulgated by the International Wool Textile Organisation (IWTO).|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} a {{new method}} for proving equidistribution of numbers. The proposed method {{is simple and}} can be used to prove equidistribution of all known classes of numbers such as Weyl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>numbers</b> and Koksma 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>numbers.</b> Emphasis of this approach is put on the complete equidistribution of numbers and a non-trivial result in this direction is obtained...|$|R

5000|$|An <b>S</b> <b>number</b> on {{the label}} of a wool suit, or other {{tailored}} wool apparel, indicates the fineness of the wool fiber used {{in the making of}} the apparel. The numbers may also be found on wool fabric and yarn. The <b>S</b> <b>numbers</b> for fine wool products are intended to state, with precision, the fineness of the wool fiber used in the product, as measured in micrometres. Fiber fineness is one of the factors determining the quality and performance of a wool product. In recent years it has also become an important marketing device used by many mills, garment makers, and retailers. The <b>S</b> <b>number</b> appears as a plural with an [...] " [...] s [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] 's [...] " [...] following the number, such as 100s or 100's.|$|R
40|$|We are {{concerned}} with the complexity reduction of a stochastic system of differential equations governing the dynamics of/na neuronal circuit describing a decision-making task. This reduction is based on the slow-fast behavior of the problem and/nholds on the whole phase space and not only locally around the spontaneous state. Macroscopic quantities, such as/nperformance and reaction times, computed applying this reduction are in agreement with previous works in which the/ncomplexity reduction is locally performed at the spontaneous point by means of a Taylor expansion.

50|$|T numbers also {{comprise}} {{a set of}} measure 0. It took about 35 years to show their existence. Wolfgang M. Schmidt in 1968 showed that examples exist. However, almost all complex <b>numbers</b> are <b>S</b> <b>numbers.</b> Mahler proved that the exponential function sends all non-zero algebraic <b>numbers</b> to <b>S</b> numbers: this shows that e is an <b>S</b> <b>number</b> and gives a proof of the transcendence of π.

40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} role a {{calculator}} {{can play in}} the developing number knowledge of three girls and three boys {{as part of their}} mathematics program, during their first two years at primary school. Random sampling was used initially to select six girls and six boys from the twenty-four children entering a 1993 prep class. These twelve children were interviewed on entrance to school and based on the performance of the twelve children on the initial interview, a girl and a boy were chosen from the higher, middle and lower achievers {{to take part in the}} full study. The class teachers involved were previously participants in the ‘Calculators in Primary Mathematics’ research program and were committed to the use of calculators in their mathematics program. A case study approach using qualitative methods within the activity theory framework is used to collect relevant data and information, an analysis of five interviews with each child and observations of the children in forty-one classroom lessons provides comprehensive data on the children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> developing <b>number</b> knowledge during the two years. The analysis questionnaires establishes each teacher 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of the children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>number</b> learning at the beginning and end of each year, compares teacher expectations with children 2 ̆ 7 s actual performance for the year and compares curriculum expectations with children 2 ̆ 7 s actual performance. A teacher interview established reasons for changes in teaching style; teacher expectations; children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>number</b> learning; and was used to confirm my research findings. An activity theory framework provides an appropriate means of co-coordinating perspectives within this research to enable a description of the child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>number</b> learning within a social environment. This framework allows for highlighting the mediation offered by the calculator supporting the children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>number</b> learning in the classroom. Levels of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> developing <b>number</b> knowledge reached when working with a calculator and as a result of calculator use are mapped against the levels recommended in ‘Mathematics in the National Curriculum’ (National Curriculum Council, December 1988), and the Curriculum and Standards Framework: Mathematics (Board of Studies 2000). Findings from this comparison illustrate that the six children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> performance in <b>number</b> was enhanced when using a calculator and indicate that on-going development and understanding of number concepts occurred at levels of performance at least two years in advance of curriculum recommendations for the first two years of school...|$|R
