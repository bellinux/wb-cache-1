40|$|Even though legumes possess high {{nutritional}} value {{and have a}} rather high protein content for plant origin products, they are underutilized mostly due to their lengthy cooking time. To increase the presence of legume-based products in human diet, new extruded products were made of <b>cow</b> <b>peas</b> (<b>Vigna</b> <b>unguiculata</b> (L.) Walp.). But as it is known, adding different moisture content to flour before extrusion can change the physical properties of the extruded product. Experiments were carried out to estimate the optimal moisture content for cow pea extrusion. After extrusion, the pH level had dropped from 6. 7 to 6. 5 and the lowest hardness rate was observed in the samples with additional 9 g 100 g- 1 of moisture - 28 ± 4 N, but the volume mass of the samples with additional 9 g 100 g- 1 of water was 263 ± 3 g L- 1; all samples were approximately 7 ± 1 mm long...|$|E

The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications using basin irrigation system. The results indicated that the reduction in 50 % of irrigation water requirement had affected the both the growth and yield of the crop. It also showed that water savings are possible without significant effect on the growth and yield of the crop at stages 1, 2, 4 and 1 & 4.

40|$|The {{competence}} of two fungal isolates for degrading petroleum hydrocarbons was evaluated. The filamentous fungi were isolated from a crude oil-contaminated soil in northeastern Ecuador, and were 99 %- 100 % similar in 18 S rDNA sequence to the genus Geomyces. Their efficiencies of degradation {{were tested in}} vitro for 30 days, using medium and soil microcosm. Residual hydrocarbons were tracked by gas liquid chromatography with a flame ionization detector. The maximum removal percentages of total petroleum hydrocarbons were 77. 3 % and 79. 9 % for experiments in the medium and soil microcosm, respectively. The percent germination of <b>cow</b> <b>pea</b> (<b>Vigna</b> <b>unguiculata)</b> seeds was increased from 20 % to 100 % upon bioremediation. Isolates sporulated optimally on minimal salts agar medium at pH 5, 25 °C temperature, 1 %- 1. 5 % substrate (crude oil) and 4 - 6 g L(- 1) N-P-K.

Copper is an essential nutrient but in excess concentration responsible for environmental pollution. The excess of copper is released from many industries to cause soil and water pollution. The copper is a heavy metal highly accumulated in soil by anthropogenic activities. In the present study, the seedlings of (<b>cow</b> <b>pea)</b> <b>Vigna</b> <b>unguiculata</b> (L) walp were treated with various concentrations of copper chloride {{and its impact on the}} morphometric, pigmental, biochemical and enzymatic characters were studied. After ten days of treatment with different concentrations of copper chloride (2 mM, 4 mM, 6 mM, 8 mM, & 10 mM), the growth parameters such as leaf area, fresh weight, dry weight, shoot length, root length were found decreased than in the control. Pigmental characters such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, carotenoides content were decreased with the increase in the concentrations of copper chloride, but the content of anthocyanin was increased and the biochemical parameters such as soluble sugar and protein content were found decreased with the increase in the concentrations of copper chloride. But the contents of free amino acid, proline and leaf nitrate were increased with increase in the concentrations of copper chloride. The activities of enzyme such as catalase and peroxidase were found increased with the increase in the concentration of copper chloride. But the NRA enzyme activity was decreased. The Atomic Absorption of Spectroscopy (AAS) technique was employed to confirm the presence of copper chloride in treated plants and control. Comparison of the values of treated plants with control reveals that copper chloride has seriously affected the <b>cow</b> <b>pea</b> plants...|$|R

40|$|In Alabama, over 400, 000 ac {{of winter}} annuals are grazed prior to {{planting}} summer row crops. Previous {{research indicates that}} cattle grazed on ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) pastures over the winter months in Alabama can be profitable, but winter grazing creates excessive compaction, which can adversely affects yields of subsequent summer crops. We initiated a study to determine the optimal tillage system for sweet corn (Zea mays, L.), southern field <b>pea</b> (<b>Vigna</b> <b>unguiculata</b> L.), and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus L.) production on a Wynnville fine sandy loam (Fine- loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Glossic Fragiudults), in north central Alabama from 2001 to 2003. Three surface tillage treatments (chisel/disk/level, disk/level, no surface tillage) and three deep tillage treatments (no deep tillage, in-row subsoiling, paratill) were arranged in a factorial randomized complete block design with four replications. Each fall, all plots were planted to ryegrass and stocked with 3 cattle ac- 1. Southern field pea yields responded to surface tillage following winter annual grazing with disking comparable to chisel and disking. Sweet corn yields responded {{to a combination of}} surface and deep tillage, although deep tillage produced similar yields to surface tillage during one growing season. Watermelon yields were maximized following winter annual grazing with only deep tillage alone without any surface tillage...|$|R
40|$|Background Current {{reforms in}} {{undergraduate}} biology education are advancing research experiences in laboratory courses. Such experiences in evolutionary biology {{have largely been}} limited to microbial systems. Methods We designed a guided-inquiry experiment in which students {{examine the effect of}} evolutionary history on the potential for adaptation in the bean beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus), an insect model system widely used in evolutionary biology research. Bean beetles lay their eggs on a variety of species of dried beans (seeds of species in the Fabaceae) and the larvae develop within the bean. They are an ideal model system for studies of experimental evolution in teaching laboratories as they are easy to rear, handle and manipulate. In this study, students design an experiment to determine if adaptation to a particular bean host pre-adapts their offspring to be more successful on a new bean host. Results Preliminary experiments by our students suggest that beetles adapted to a lower quality host (adzuki beans, Vigna angularis) are more successful on a new higher quality host (black-eyed <b>peas,</b> <b>Vigna</b> <b>unguiculata)</b> than beetles adapted to a higher quality host (mung beans,Vigna radiata). However, beetles adapted to black-eyed peas are more successful on mung beans than adzuki beans. Conclusions Taken together, their results show that an evolutionary history on a low quality host might allow bean beetles to be more successful at invading new hosts...|$|R

40|$|Protease C 1, {{an enzyme}} from soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merrill cv Amsoy 71) {{seedling}} cotyledons, was previously {{determined to be}} the enzyme responsible for the initial degradation of the alpha' and alpha subunits, but not the beta subunit, of beta-conglycinin storage protein. The sizes of the proteolytic products generated {{by the action of}} protease C 1 suggest that the cleavage sites on the alpha' and alpha subunits of beta-conglycinin may be located in their N-terminal domain, which is not found in the beta subunit of beta-conglycinin. To check this hypothesis, storage proteins from other plant species that are homologous to either the alpha'/alpha or the beta subunit of beta-conglycinin were tested as substrates. As expected, the convicilin from pea (Pisum sativum), a protein homologous to the alpha' and alpha subunits of beta-conglycinin, was digested by protease C 1. The vicilins from pea as well as vicilins from adzuki bean (Vigna angularis), garden bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), black-eyed <b>pea</b> (<b>Vigna</b> <b>unguiculata),</b> and mung bean (Vigna radiata), storage proteins that are homologous to the beta subunit of soybean beta-conglycinin, were not degraded by protease C 1. Degradation of soybean beta-conglycinin involves a sequential attack of the alpha subunit at multiple sites, culminating in the formation of a stable intermediate of 53. 5 kD and a final product of 48. 0 kD. The cleavage sites resulting in this formation of the intermediates and final product were determined by N-terminal analysis. These were compared to the known amino acid sequences of the three beta-conglycinin subunits. Results showed these two polypeptides to be generated by proteolysis of the alpha subunit at regions bearing long strings of acidic amino acid residues...|$|R
40|$|Nutritional {{management}} for diabetic patients based on selection of low available carbohydrate foods {{has been criticized}} because the same availability of carbohydrate in different foods may result in different degree of glycemic response. This management is now being corrected by additional aid in selecting foods with the glycemic index (GI) of foods. GI {{is a measure of}} the glycemic response to the carbohydrate component within a food relative to the response to an equal carbohydrate portion of reference food (glucose or white bread). In Indonesia, data of the glycemic index of foods is still very limited. The objectives of the research are to provide GI of selected legumes, including red bean (Vigna umbellata), Mung bean (Phaseolus aureus), <b>cow</b> <b>pea</b> (<b>Vigna</b> sinensis ENDL), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan MILLSPAUGH), edible podded peas (Pisum sativum LINN) and soy bean (Glycine max MERR). Eleventh health and normal volunteers (not diabetic) were provided. The volunteers took an overnight fasting, blood were drawn in the morning and analyzed for serum glucose. Then they were given the test legumes containing total carbohydrates equivalent to 25 -g glucose to be consumed. Blood samples were drawn for glucose measurement every 30 minutes until 120 min after meal. Serum glucose was determined enzymatically and the glucose responses were drawn graphically. The GI of the beans studied was lowest for red bean (26) and highest for mung bean (76), Edible podded pea and soy bean had similar value of GI i. e. 30 and 31; whereas pigeon and <b>cow</b> <b>pea</b> had a higher value i. e. 35 and 51, respectively...|$|R
