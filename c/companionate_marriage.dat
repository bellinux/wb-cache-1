This particular argument has led many modern feminists to suggest that Wollstonecraft intentionally avoids granting women any sexual desire. Cora Kaplan argues that the [...] "negative and prescriptive assault on female sexuality" [...] is a [...] "leitmotif" [...] of the Rights of Woman. For example, Wollstonecraft advises her readers to [...] "calmly let passion subside into friendship" [...] in the ideal <b>companionate</b> <b>marriage</b> (that is, in the ideal of a love-based marriage that was developing at the time). It would be better, she writes, when [...] "two virtuous young people marry [...] [...] [...] if some circumstances checked their passion". According to Wollstonecraft, [...] "love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom". As Mary Poovey explains, [...] "Wollstonecraft betrays her fear that female desire might in fact court man's lascivious and degrading attentions, that the subordinate position women have been given might even be deserved. Until women can transcend their fleshly desires and fleshly forms, they will be hostage to the body." [...] If women are not interested in sexuality, they cannot be dominated by men. Wollstonecraft worries that women are consumed with [...] "romantic wavering", that is, they are interested only in satisfying their lusts. Because the Rights of Woman eliminates sexuality from a woman's life, Kaplan contends, it [...] "expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual" [...] {{while at the same time}} [...] "exaggerat the importance of the sensual in the everyday life of women". Wollstonecraft was so determined to wipe sexuality from her picture of the ideal woman that she ended up foregrounding it by insisting upon its absence. But as Kaplan and others have remarked, Wollstonecraft may have been forced to make this sacrifice: [...] "it is important to remember that the notion of woman as politically enabled and independent [...] fatally linked [...] to the unrestrained and vicious exercise of her sexuality." ...|$|E

50|$|While it is a {{relatively}} new practice to grant same-sex couples the same form of legal marital recognition as commonly granted to mixed-sex couples, there is some history of recorded same-sex unions around the world.

40|$|This essay {{argues that}} Frances Burney in Cecilia; or Memoirs of an Heiress (1782) critiques {{political}} debates and literary conventions focused on clandestine marriage. Through two plots of this novel, one economic and one focused on courtship, Burney interprets clandestine {{marriage as a}} scapegoat for the deeply flawed institution of marriage itself. The courtship narrative rewrites several aspects of conventional clandestine marriage plots, such as stock male characters, lengthy debates between love and duty, climactic wedding scenes, and punitive conclusions. The economic plot, featuring the stories of Mrs. Hill, Henrietta Belfield, and Priscilla Harrel, undermines Parliament’s claims about the economic outcomes of heiresses’ marital choices. The economic plot eventually usurps the courtship plot, leading to a dystopian conclusion that tacitly argues marriage itself is the problem, not deviations from an idealized norm of parentally approved <b>companionate</b> <b>marriages</b> of choice...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of EnglishAccording to Judith Butler, both today's {{progressive}} {{society and}} the industrialized British Victorian era use binary genders to create a system of heterosexual reproduction that ensures {{the survival of the}} species. In Elizabeth Gaskell's Wives and Daughters, George Elliot's Middlemarch, and Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure the main female characters rebel from the bourgeois feminine gender roles of the beautiful wife and nurturing mother, expressing a preference for the masculine pursuit of intellect. Without a corrective motherly feminine influence, Molly Gibson, Dorothea Brooke, and Sue Bridehead delve into the masculine realms outside of the conventionally feminine domestic sphere. Neglecting their dress and other standards of loveliness, their masculinized bodies do not reflect the encoded bodily messages of their feminine middle-class standing. When confronted with the contrast of the excessively feminine charms of Cynthia Kirkpatrick, Rosamond Vincy, and Arabella Donn; the masculine scholarly interests of the heroines appear sexually unattractive and lowers their wifely value. However, once the heroines are introduced into the scripted interaction of heterosexual relationships, jealousy of their feminine rival and societal punishment for their gender confusion causes Molly, Dorothea, and Sue to acquiesce to proper middle-class respectability. Although confined to the boarders of middle-class femininity, Molly and Dorothea find methods of masculine intellectual expression in their <b>companionate</b> <b>marriages,</b> while Sue, resigned to her subjugated fate, suffers in an inequitable marriage...|$|R

Instead the secular ruling classes enforced a pragmatic moral code over sexual behaviour and inheritance, with a view to preserving civic order and building prosperity across generations.

40|$|The <b>companionate</b> {{theory of}} <b>marriage</b> {{suggests}} that egalitarianism {{in practice and}} belief leads to higher marital quality for wives {{and higher levels of}} positive emotion work on the part of husbands. Our analysis of women’s marital quality and men’s marital emotion work provides little evidence in support of this theory. Rather, in examining women’s marital quality and men’s emotional investments in marriage, we find that dyadic commitment to institutional ideals about marriage and women’s contentment with the division of household tasks are more critical. We also show that men’s marital emotion work is a very important determinant of women’s marital quality. We conclude by noting that “her ” marriage is happiest when it combines elements of the new and old: that is, gender equity and normative commitment to the institution of marriage. The last century has witnessed profound changes in the functions, character and stability of marriage. In particular, the concomitant rise in women’s social and economic status, the relative decline in social and economic functions once associated with the family, and the increased cultural power of expressive individualism have all conspired to heighten the importance of th...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the role of}} marriage in society, focusing on the state 2 ̆ 7 s use of marriage {{as a proxy for}} desirable outcomes in social policy. Its analytical point of departure is the normative vision of modern marriage embraced by many of its proponents. From there, the idealized marriage is analyzed, not as a monolithic, opaque institution, but as one whose functional components may be identified and examined. The Article identifies the following as the primary functions of the normative marital family: expression; companionship; sex/procreation; caretaking; and economic support or redistribution. Analyzing the roles in society of each of these functions, it concludes that: (1) the expressive and <b>companionate</b> functions of <b>marriage</b> provide no societal benefit sufficient to justify state interference in those functions; (2) its purely sexual and procreative functions merit privacy and should, in all respects, be treated no differently than nonmarital sex and procreation; but (3) its caretaking and economic support functions benefit society significantly. Indeed, here the state 2 ̆ 7 s interest is at its apex. Accordingly, direct support of these two closely related functions, rather than the crude proxy of marriage in its entirety, should be the focus of state social policy in this area...|$|R

Many of the societal changes in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} century contributed to the rise of the <b>companionate</b> <b>marriage,</b> and these many changes are reflected in the rising genre—the novel. Specifically, Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice incorporates the major themes of the novel as a genre, specifically, the rise of the individual and equality of souls, to show that the companionate model of marriage makes marriage a formational platform for two individuals. Austen clearly sets apart Elizabeth and Darcy’s marriage as the strongest union because they prove to be better suited companions based on their willingness to make their marriage the foundation on which they form each other as individuals and as a couple. Through this textual study and by contrasting and comparing each marriage, Darcy and Elizabeth’s marriage stands out because of their desire to make marriage a formational basis for their lives.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the extent to which}} married women were able to negotiate independent leisure outside the home. It explores the constraints women faced and any strategies used to resist restrictions imposed by their husbands. The evidence is gathered from an industrial community in East Cleveland, an area dominated by the iron and steel industries and in particular ironstone mining. It is focused on the years between 1939 and 1960, a period in which the ideology of <b>companionate</b> <b>marriage</b> was gaining widespread acceptance. Oral testimony confirms the expectation that marital partners should spend some leisure time together outside the home. However, the ideology of <b>companionate</b> <b>marriage</b> appears to have put some women under added pressure to abandon independent leisure for the sake of their marriage and its public profile. Indeed, it is clear that most women had less access to independent leisure than their male partners. Some women accepted this as natural; others tried to influence their access to leisure with a variety of strategies and with varying degrees of success. Ultimately the majority valued the stability of their marriage and its public profile more than the right to independent leisure...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes dowry {{in three}} Shakespeare plays—The Taming of the Shrew, Romeo and Juliet, and The Merchant of Venice. The analysis aims {{to show that}} the dowry negotiations and agreements are the most important component of the patriarchal structure of marriage depicted in Shakespeare’s plays. Since dowry agreements signal the impending transition from feme sole to feme covert, they are appropriated by the women in the three plays under consideration as the first stage in a process to assure subjectivity after their marriages. To maintain subjectivity, Katharina, Bianca, Juliet, Portia, and Jessica seek to create and occupy a liminal space between the subjectivity allowed a feme sole and the obliteration of the legal and social identity demanded by their new status as femes covert. Since dowry negotiations and agreements signal the impending change from subject to object, the women use them as the first stage of opportunity in their quests to maintain subjectivity after marriage. In the introduction, I provide the theoretical foundation for the feminist reading of the three plays as well as emphasize the importance of dowry to the arranged and <b>companionate</b> <b>marriage</b> in early modern England. In the body of the dissertation, chapters 2 through 5, I analyze dowry’s relationship to the arranged and companionate marriages that occur in the plays under consideration. In Chapter Two, I explore the transition from shrew to good wife negotiated by Katharina in her arranged marriage to Petruchio; I also explore the transformation of Bianca from good girl to shrew after her <b>companionate</b> <b>marriage</b> to Lucentio. Chapter Three considers the inherent conflict between the arranged marriage proposed by Juliet’s father and her <b>companionate</b> <b>marriage</b> to Romeo. Juliet secretly marries her beloved, but the overwhelming power of the Capulet/ Montague feud leads to the tragic ending of the play. In Chapter Four, I analyze the Dowry Lottery, its mechanics for selecting Portia’s ideal husband and its aftermath as well as Jessica’s transformation from Jewish feme sole to Christian feme covert. I conclude with a discussion Shakespeare’s use of dowry as a character development device and to reveal the father’s authentic relationships with their daughters...|$|E
