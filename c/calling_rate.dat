In Doñana Protected Area, the tawny owl co-exists alongside its intraguild predator, the eagle owl Bubo bubo. We considered four scenarios to study the vocal behaviour of tawny owls at dusk by analysing: A) the <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> of all males in 29 sites; B) the <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> at dusk of males living within the home range of the intraguild predator; C) the <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> of males living within the home range of the intraguild predator between 60 and 90 min after sunset; and D) the duration of male vocal bouts in visits where eagle owls have called.

The OCRs were examined in the presence of varying numbers of whales, using a log-linear model to investigate the dependence of the <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> on whale density. The number of whales present exerted a strong quadratic effect on the OCR, which peaked at around 15 whales and decreased to a low rate as whale presence approached a maximum, for all calls combined and for four of their constituent 13 call types: a quadratic trend was present to varying degrees among the remaining call types. Both quadratic and linear trends were absent when OCR was assessed against number of groups present, possibly because group size increased with increasing density of whales. A linear regression on the CPW and CPG suggested that there was a negative inverse relationship with the number of whales and groups present respectively. These findings are important in that, while they preclude the estimation of absolute numbers from <b>call</b> <b>rates,</b> they imply that, under the conditions prevailing in Walker Bay, southern right whales were aware of the presence, arrival and departure of other animals in their vicinity and adjusted their vocal behaviour accordingly.

Instead, fed males returned sooner to the chorus. Additionally, fed males called more often than control males, a novel response for anurans.

40|$|Abstract Signal {{attributes}} {{should show}} {{different degrees of}} variability depending on the information to be conveyed. Species identity is usually associated with stereotyped features of a signal, whereas other types of information such as individual quality and motivation are associated with signal plasticity. Lusitanian toadfish males form aggregations during the breeding season and emit a tonal advertisement call (the boatwhistle) to attract mates to their nests. We test {{the hypothesis that the}} boatwhistle can convey information both on individual identity and moti-vation by checking how signal parameters vary with time. We study how the physical (tide level) and social (calling alone or in a chorus) environments and male <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> affect this advertisement signal and how all these external and internal factors (environment, social and male motiva-tion) blend to modulate the Lusitanian toadfish’s advertise-ment call. Boatwhistles of each male were very stereotyped in short periods of time (minutes), but intra-male signal variability greatly increased in a longer time scale (days). Nevertheless, significant differences among males could still be found even in a long time scale. Pulse period was the acoustic feature that most contributed to discriminate among males. Tide level and male <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> modulated boatwhistle characteristics, and there was a differential effect of tide on call attributes depending on male <b>calling</b> <b>rate.</b> Social acoustic environment only affected <b>calling</b> <b>rate.</b> These results suggest that inter-individual differences in call characteristics and call plasticity may mediate both male– male assessment and mate choice...|$|E

40|$|A {{negative}} relationship between parasite intensity and male ornament condition or sexual display rate {{is one of the}} conditions of the parasite-mediated sexual selection model. In anurans, temporal properties of calling behavior, and particularly calling rates, are the best candidates to express a {{negative relationship}} with parasite intensity, given the high energy costs of calling and the fact that calls are potentially under strong intersexual selection. We studied the relationship between call parameters and helminth parasite intensity in males of a Brazilian subtropical treefrog, Hypsiboas prasinus. We tested the hypotheses that: 1) calling characteristics are correlated negatively to parasite intensity; and 2) the relationship between calling performance and parasite intensity is more pronounced when dynamic properties are considered. According to our predictions, only rate, the most important dynamic property of calling behavior, is associated with individual variation in parasite intensity. Males that call at higher rates show lower total parasite intensity. The {{negative relationship between}} parasite intensity and <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> in H. prasinus could be because of the higher energy cycles associated with the maintenance of high calling performance. Also, theoretically, <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> could work as an honest signal of anuran male quality, although the causal relationship between calling variation and parasite intensity, as well as the relevance of this relationship for female choice and male reproductive success, remain to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|Immune system {{activation}} {{may benefit}} hosts by generating resistance to parasites. However, natural resources are usually limited, causing a trade-off between {{the investment in}} immunity and that in other life-history or sexually selected traits. Despite its importance {{for the evolution of}} host defense, state-dependent fitness costs of immunity received little attention under natural conditions. In a field experiment we manipulated the nutritional condition of male field crickets Gryllus campestris and subsequently investigated the effect of an induced immune response through inoculation of bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Immune system activation caused a condition-dependent reduction in body condition, which was proportional to the condition-gain during the preceding food-supplementation period. Independent of nutritional condition, the immune insult induced an enduring reduction in daily <b>calling</b> <b>rate,</b> whereas control-injected males fully regained their baseline level of sexual signaling following a temporary decline. Since daily <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> affects female mate choice under natural conditions, this suggests a decline in male mating success as a cost of induced immunity. Food supplementation enhanced male life span, whereas the immune Insult reduced longevity, independent of nutritional status. Thus, immune system activation ultimately curtails male Fitness due to a combined decline in sexual display and life span. Our field study thus indicates a key role for fitness costs of induced immunity in the evolution of host defense. In particular, costs expressed in sexually selected traits might warrant the honest advertisement of male health status, thus representing an important mechanism in parasite-mediated sexual selection...|$|E

We conducted playback experiments to test the hypothesis that calls of toads may influence the calling behaviour of frogs (Limnodynastes convexiusculus and Litoria rothii). Male L. convexiusculus adjusted their <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> and the variance in inter-call interval in response to a variety of sounds, including the calls of cane toads {{as well as those of}} other native frog species, and other anthropogenic noise, whereas L. rothii did not.

Thus, males of one frog species reduced their <b>calling</b> <b>rate,</b> possibly to minimise energy expenditure during periods of acoustic interference generated by cane toads. In spite of such modifications, the number of overlapping calls (within stimulus periods) did not differ significantly from that expected by chance. In natural conditions, the calls of cane toads are continuous rather than episodic, leaving fewer gaps of silence that male frogs could exploit. Future work could usefully quantify the magnitude of temporal (e. g. diel and seasonal) and spatial overlap between calling by toads and by frogs and the impact of call-structure shifts on the ability of male frogs to attract receptive females...|$|E
