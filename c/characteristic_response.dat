50|$|Due to {{the host}} cell {{specificity}} of CPEs, researchers can also use them to test any discrepancies in an experiment. For many viral infections, different host cell strains may have a <b>characteristic</b> <b>response.</b> Currently, there are many concerns within the research community about the validity and purity of cell strains. Contamination has risen within and among laboratories. CPEs {{can be used to}} test the purity of a certain cell line. For example, HeLa CCL-2 is a common cell line used {{in a wide variety of}} research areas. To test the purity of the HeLa cells, CPEs were observed that occurred after inoculation with Coxsackievirus B3. These CPEs included morphology changes and cell morbidity rates. Carson et al. determined that the discrepancy is due to the heterogeneous nature of the commercial HeLa cells as compared to the homogeneous nature of HeLa cells that have been propagated for generations in a lab.|$|E

50|$|Also of {{interest}} in the fear appeals literature has been the contribution of individual characteristics. The goal has been to understand which individual differences in personality or psychological traits contribute or detract from the effectiveness of the fear appeal. Individual moderating variables studied thus far include trait anxiety, age, ethnicity, gender, coping style, locus of control, self-esteem, perceived vulnerability, need for cognition and uncertainty orientation. Of these, uncertainty orientation and need for cognition have been found to interact with the level of threat. Uncertainty orientation is an individual's <b>characteristic</b> <b>response</b> to uncertainty. That is, whether one attends to or avoids and ignores the source of the uncertainty. Those with an uncertainty orientation tend to be more motivated to deeply process the information presented as the personal relevance increases, whereas those with a certainty orientation will actively avoid it. Some early studies examined other characteristics, such as individual thresholds for fear arousal, to see if they moderated the effect of fear on persuasion. A study by Janis and Feshbach (1954) found that those with lower fear arousal thresholds were the least compelled to act by the high fear appeals, as they tended to react with defensive control responses. Lower threshold subjects were also more easily persuaded by counterarguments following the fear appeal. Trait anxiety has also been the subject of some of the early research, which has since been found to have no discernible effect on persuasion.|$|E

40|$|The risks {{associated}} with exposure to radiation make it critical that digital imaging systems give the best possible images for a given dose to the patient. The DQE is the most widely accepted measure of performance and dose efficiency for digital radiography systems, however it is not commonly measured in a clinical environment as part of routine quality assurance. The primary {{reason for this is}} that the data provided to the user by clinical systems has typically undergone image processing and therefore may have a non-linear <b>characteristic</b> <b>response.</b> This is a problem because the Fourier metrics of the DQE require a linear response. In this thesis a method to measure the DQE using processed image data is presented.

40|$|Broadband, variable, {{and random}} {{excitations}} are often suppressed using active vibration absorbers (AVAs). While AVAs can be effective, {{they also are}} expensive and subject to instability when the disturbance is ill defined. A state-switched absorber (SSA) {{can be used for}} these same vibration classes while reducing the expense and instability because an SSA is only allowed to be active at discrete instances. SSAs are spring-mass-damper devices in which at least one element is controllably variable. The work presented in this dissertation evaluates the properties of magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) to assess their use in SSAs as variable springs. MREs are elastomers doped with magnetically permeable material, generally iron. They are modeled as lossy springs, and have stiffness and loss factor components. Natural frequency and stiffness behavior, and their relationships to static displacement, iron content, and forcing frequency and amplitude were determined. Loss factors were found to be independent of MRE content, configuration, and static displacement. This was confirmation that MREs are in fact controllable springs. Natural frequencies changed in the presence of magnetic fields by as much as 360 %. The corresponding change in static displacement could not account for this frequency change. Transient data was found by determining the length of time it took for an MRE to achieve quasi-steady state oscillation behavior when subjected to a harmonic excitation. This time was referred to as the <b>characteristic</b> <b>response</b> time. The <b>characteristic</b> <b>response</b> time correlated to the ratio of the forcing frequency to the zero-field natural frequency. When a magnetic field was turned on, the <b>characteristic</b> <b>response</b> time on average was found to be consistently longer than when the magnetic field was turned off, regardless of iron content or configuration. The difference between these two <b>characteristic</b> <b>response</b> times is caused by the particles' mechanics. To form a chain, a magnetic field must both be set up, and particles must move to join together. When a chain is broken, the magnetic field must merely be removed. However, this difference gives opportunities for future research to be conducted on controlling MREs' transient responses. Ph. D.
