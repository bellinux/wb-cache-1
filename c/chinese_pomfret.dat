40|$|The {{concentrations}} of organochlorine insecticides DDT (Dichloro diphenyl trichloro ethane) and Heptachlor were investigated {{to estimate the}} current status of insecticides used in dry fish in different seasons and different species. Six most popular species of dry fishes namely Bombay duck (Loittya), Ribbon fish (Chhuri), Shrimp (Chingri), Hilsha shed (Ilish), <b>Chinese</b> <b>pomfret</b> (Rupchanda) and Indian salmon (Lakhua) were collected from Asadgonj (whole sell market for dry fish) of Chittagong, Bangladesh at different seasons, six samples at winter season (December) and six same samples at rainy season (July). The range of DDT concentration at winter was found 3. 6 ug kg- 1 to 250. 8 ug kg- 1 and at rainy season the range of concentration was found 11. 1 ug kg- 1 to 1107. 4 ug kg- 1. The range of Heptachlor concentration at winter was found 0. 4 ug kg- 1 to 2. 5 ug kg- 1 and at rainy season was found 1. 1 ug kg- 1 to 37. 8 ug kg- 1.

40|$|Three {{species of}} Opisthomonorcheides Parukhin, 1966 are {{reported}} {{for the first time}} from Indonesian waters: O. pampi (Wang, 1982) Liu, Peng, Gao, Fu, Wu, Lu, Gao & Xiao, 2010 and O. ovacutus (Mamaev, 1970) Machida, 2011 from Parastromateus niger (Bloch), and O. decapteri Parukhin, 1966 from Atule mate (Cuvier). Both O. pampi and O. ovacutus can now be considered widespread in the Indo-Pacific region, with earlier records of these species being from Fujian Province, China and Penang, Malaysia, respectively. We redescribe O. decapteri from one of its original hosts, Atule mate, off New Caledonia, and report this species from Jakarta Bay, Indonesia, extending its range throughout the Indian Ocean into the south-western Pacific. All three species possess a genital atrium that is long, sometimes very long, and a genital pore that is located in the forebody. This validates the interpretation that the original description was erroneous in reporting the genital pore in the hindbody, well posterior to the ventral sucker. These observations verify the synonymy of Retractomonorchis Madhavi, 1977 with Opisthomonorcheides. A major discrepancy between the species of Opisthomonorcheides is that some are described with the uterus entering the terminal organ laterally and some with it entering terminally; this feature needs further analysis. Based on the length of the genital atrium and the posterior extent of the vitellarium, the 27 species of Opisthomonorcheides considered valid can be divided into four groups. Among the 53 host records analysed, the families Carangidae (53 % of records), Stromateidae (17 %) and Serranidae (5. 7 %) are the most common; the reports are overwhelmingly from members of the Perciformes (91 %), with further records in the Clupeiformes (5. 7 %), Gadiformes (1. 9 %) and Pleuronectiformes (1. 9 %). Two fish genera (Parastromateus Bleeker and Pampus Bonaparte) dominate the recorded hosts, with the black pomfret Parastromateus niger harbouring six species, the silver pomfret Pampus argenteus (Euphrasen) harbouring six, and the <b>Chinese</b> silver <b>pomfret</b> P. chinensis (Euphrasen) two. A host-parasite checklist is presented. We discuss the host-specificity of members of the genus, questioning some records such as that of O. decapteri in a deep-sea macrourid. We also comment on the morphological similarity, but phylogenetic distance, between the various Pomfret species, advancing the possibility that a series of host misidentifications has occurred. Sequences of the ITS 2 rDNA gene generated for O. pampi and O. ovacutus are briefly discussed and molecular data are lodged in the GenBank database...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of gamma radiation (3, 5 and 8 kGy) in combination with low temperature (- 20 °C) for extending the quality and shelf-life of degutted fresh <b>Chinese</b> <b>pomfret,</b> Pampus chinensis. Quality assessment was studied by monitoring the chemical (TVN, TMA), microbiological (TBC, TMC) and organoleptic changes in irradiated and non-irradiated (control) samples. Among chemical indicators of spoilage, total volatile nitrogen (TVN) values increased to 55 mg/ 100 g for nonirradiated samples whereas for irradiated fish lower values of 45 mg/ 100 g, 27. 5 mg/ 100 g and 18. 7 mg/ 100 g were recorded at 3, 5 and 8 kGy respectively (day 90). Significantly lower values were obtained for irradiated samples reaching a final trimethylamine (TMA) value of 7. 1, 5. 3 and 4. 9 mg N/ 100 g at 3, 5 and 8 kGy respectively whereas for non-irradiated samples it increased slowly attaining a value of 32. 5 mg N/ 100 g after 90 days. Total bacterial counts as well as total mould counts for non-irradiated pomfret were {{higher than that of}} irradiated fish. The organoleptic scores of control sample were gradually decreased with the progress of storage period whereas irradiated samples showed the acceptable score upto 90 days. This study concludes that gamma radiation in combination with low temperature showed maximum shelf-life extension (90 days) in each dose of radiation used but in 8 kGy radiation, Pampus chinensis showed best quality.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to evaluate the influence of ice storage on the raw materials {{for the production of}} high quality dried fish products in solar tunnel dryer by determining organoleptic, biochemical and bacteriological aspects. Fresh fish samples of silver jew fish, Bombay duck, big-eye tuna, <b>Chinese</b> <b>pomfret</b> and ribbon fish were collected from the landing centre of Cox`s Bazar and stored in ice for 13 days. During the storage period, required quantity of fish samples were taken out every three days for drying in a Hohenheim type solar tunnel dryer. The quality of the raw materials during storage and corresponding dried products produced in the dryer were evaluated. One day ice stored raw materials exhibited excellent quality on the basis of odour, colour, appearance and consistency of flesh. However, the overall organoleptic qualities of all samples were acceptable conditions up to 10 days of ice storage. Four days ice stored raw materials produced excellent quality of dried products in the solar dryer, while the dried products produced from 10 days of ice stored fishes were also found acceptable qualities judged by their characteristic colour, odour, texture, infestation and broken pieces. There were little or no changes in initial moisture content of 70. 5 to 89. 1 % in raw materials during 13 days of ice storage. The initial total volatile base, peroxide value and aerobic plate count of the raw materials were 2. 37 to 5. 15 mg N (100 g) - 1, 1. 27 to 2. 81 m eq kg - 1 oil and 2. 75 x 10 2 to 2. 0 x 10 3 CFU g - 1, respectively, which increased considerably beyond the acceptable limits after 13 days of ice storage. The moisture content of the dried products prepared from various days of ice stored fish samples were in the range of 15. 9 to 16. 4 % which were within the acceptable limit. The TVB-N, peroxide and APC values of the dried products produced from up to 10 days of ice stored raw materials were found within the limit of acceptable levels, which increased beyond the acceptable limits when raw materials stored up to 13 days in ice were used to produce solar tunnel dried fish products...|$|E
