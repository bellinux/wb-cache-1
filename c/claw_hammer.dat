5000|$|<b>Claw</b> <b>hammers</b> can be {{constructed}} many ways but generally come {{in one of two}} forms. The first, and most popular, type of hammer is the two piece hammer. This hammer is constructed from a forged steel head with a hole for fixing a handle. One end is made to fit the hole in the hammer head, then a steel wedge is driven into the wood which forces it to expand and secure the hammer head to the handle. Other handle materials include glass fiber and even carbon fiber.|$|R
5000|$|The Hammerskins logo, {{depicting}} two <b>claw</b> <b>hammers</b> {{crossed to}} resemble goose-stepping legs, {{is based on}} a fictitious neo-nazi organization depicted in the 1982 film Pink Floyd - The Wall. The portrayal of the fictional group in the film was intended to show Nazism negatively. Their logo and motto Hammerskins forever, forever hammerskins (H.F.F.H.) often appear in their paraphernalia and tattoos. Crew 38 and Hammerskins members also frequently identify themselves with the slogan [...] "838", meaning [...] "hail the crossed hammers" [...] (the acronym H.C.H. translates into the eighth, third and eighth letters of the alphabet).|$|R

[...] Kemper replied, [...] "No, good night!", before waiting for her to fall asleep and {{returning}} to bludgeon her with a <b>claw</b> <b>hammer</b> and slit her throat with a knife. He then decapitated her and engaged in irrumatio with her severed head before using it as a dart board; stating that he [...] "put [...] on a shelf and screamed at it for an hour... threw darts at it," [...] and ultimately, [...] "smashed her face in." [...] He also cut out her tongue and larynx {{and put them in the}} garbage disposal. However, the garbage disposal could not break down the tough vocal cords and ejected the tissue back into the sink. [...] "That seemed appropriate," [...] Kemper later said, [...] "as much as she'd bitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years." [...] He then had sex with his mother's corpse, hid it in a closet and went out to drink. Upon his return, he invited his mother's best friend, 59-year-old Sara Taylor [...] "Sally" [...] Hallett, over to the house for dinner and a movie. When Hallett arrived, he strangled her to death, decapitated her and spent the night with her exanimate body.

On February 27, 2004, in Leicester, England, 17-year-old Warren Leblanc lured 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah into a park and murdered him by stabbing him repeatedly with a <b>claw</b> <b>hammer</b> and a knife. Leblanc was reportedly obsessed with Manhunt, although investigation quickly revealed that the killer did not even own a copy of the game.

6000|$|But when I {{found that}} Biddy could never succeed in getting near {{her in the}} pasture, and that any kind of success in the milking {{operations}} required my vigorous personal exertions morning and evening, the matter wore a more serious aspect, and I began to feel quite pensive and apprehensive. It is very well {{to talk of the}} pleasures of the milkmaid going out in the balmy freshness of the purple dawn; but imagine a poor fellow pulled out of bed on a drizzly, rainy morning, and equipping himself for a scamper through a wet pasture lot, rope in hand, at the heels of such a termagant as mine! In fact, madam established a regular series of exercises, which had all to be gone through before she would suffer herself to be captured; as, first, she would station herself plump {{in the middle of a}} marsh, which lay at the lower part of the lot, and look very innocent and absent-minded, as if reflecting on some sentimental subject. [...] "Suke! Suke! Suke!" [...] I ejaculate, cautiously tottering along the edge of the marsh, and holding out an ear of corn. The lady looks gracious, and comes forward, almost within reach of my hand. I make a plunge to throw the rope over her horns, and away she goes, kicking up mud and water into my face in her flight, while I, losing my balance, tumble forward into the marsh. I pick myself up, and, full of wrath, behold her placidly chewing her cud on the other side, with the meekest air imaginable, as who should say, [...] "I hope you are not hurt, sir." [...] I dash through swamp and bog furiously, resolving to carry all by a coup de main. Then follows a miscellaneous season of dodging, scampering, and bopeeping, among the trees of the grove, interspersed with sundry occasional races across the bog aforesaid. I always wondered how I caught her every day; and when I had tied her head to one post and her heels to another, I wiped the sweat from my brow, and thought I was paying dear for the eccentricities of genius. A genius she certainly was, for besides her surprising agility, she had other talents equally extraordinary. There was no fence that she could not take down; nowhere that she could not go. She took the pickets off the garden fence at her pleasure, using her horns as handily as I could use a <b>claw</b> <b>hammer.</b> Whatever she had a mind to, whether it were a bite in the cabbage garden, or a run in the corn patch, or a foraging expedition into the flower borders, she made herself equally welcome and at home. Such a scampering and driving, such cries of [...] "Suke here" [...] and [...] "Suke there," [...] as constantly greeted our ears, kept our little establishment in a constant commotion. At last, when she one morning made a plunge at the skirts of my new broadcloth frock coat, and carried off one flap on her horns, my patience gave out, and I determined to sell her.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile {{also came}} the chickadees in flocks, which, {{picking up the}} crumbs the {{squirrels}} had dropped, flew to the nearest twig and, placing them under their <b>claws,</b> <b>hammered</b> away at them with their little bills, {{as if it were}} an insect in the bark, till they were sufficiently reduced for their slender throats. A little flock of these titmice came daily to pick a dinner out of my woodpile, or the crumbs at my door, with faint flitting lisping notes, like the tinkling of icicles in the grass, or else with sprightly day day day, or more rarely, in spring-like days, a wiry summery phe-be from the woodside. They were so familiar that at length one alighted on an armful of wood which I was carrying in, and pecked at the sticks without fear. I once had a sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment while I was hoeing in a village garden, and I felt that I was more distinguished by that circumstance than I should have been by any epaulet I could have worn. The squirrels also grew at last to be quite familiar, and occasionally stepped upon my shoe, when that was the nearest way.|$|R

50|$|Deformities of {{the foot}} include hammer toe, trigger toe, and <b>claw</b> toe. <b>Hammer</b> toe can be {{described}} as an abnormal contraction or “buckling” of a toe. This is done by a partial or complete dislocation of one of the joints, which form the toes. Since the toes are deformed further, these may press against a shoe and cause pain.

40|$|Transposition of the flexor digitorum longus tendon {{has been}} widely {{reported}} for the correction of flexible <b>claw</b> or <b>hammer</b> toe deformities. In contrast, {{a search of the}} literature revealed no previous reports of transposition of the flexor digitorum brevis tendon for treatment of these conditions. We performed a cadaver study to determine whether the flexor digitorum brevis tendon is long enough to be transferred to the dorsum of the proximal phalanx of the toe from its lateral or medial aspect. Transposition of the flexor digitorum brevis tendon was attempted in 180 toes of cadaver feet: 45 second toes, 45 third toes, 45 fourth toes, and 45 fifth toes. The flexor digitorum brevis tendon was long enough to be successfully transposed in 100 % of the second, third, and fourth toes and in 42 (93. 3 %) of the fifth toes. In the three remaining fifth toes (6. 7 %), the flexor digitorum brevis tendon was absent, a known anatomical variation. In conclusion, transfer of the flexor digitorum brevis tendon to the dorsum of the proximal phalanx can be performed for correction of <b>claw</b> or <b>hammer</b> toe deformities, especially in the second, third, and fourth toes. The transverse aponeurotic fibers originating from the extensor digitorum longus impede the transfer of the flexor digitorum brevis tendon, and meticulous excision of these fibers is essential {{to the success of the}} procedure.

We dissected thirty-three fresh-frozen specimens that had been obtained from be-low-the-knee amputations. The specimens included ten normal feet, fourteen feet that had claw toes, six feet that had hammer toes, and three feet that had an un-categorized deformity. The contributions of abnormal-ities of the skin, tendons, joint capsule, and collateral ligaments to deformity of the metatarsophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints were determined by Se-quential sectioning of all of those soft-tissue components.

The group released a cassette and some small-issue EPs and singles before signing to Sympathy for the Record Industry, who released their debut LP, an eponymous effort, in 1990. In 1991 they did an album entirely covering Devo's 1978 Are We Not Men? We Are Devo!. The group signed to Epitaph Records for their 1993 release, Pablum. In 1994, <b>Claw</b> <b>Hammer</b> performed as the backing band on Wayne Kramer's Epitaph release, The Hard Stuff.
