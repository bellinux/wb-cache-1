40|$|In many applications, it {{is desired}} to {{dynamically}} establish temporary multicast groups for secure message delivery. It is also {{often the case}} that the group membership information itself is sensitive and needs to be well protected. However, existing solutions either fail {{to address the issue of}} membership anonymity or do not scale well for dynamically established groups. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable solution for dynamical multicast group setup and yet protecting group membership anonymity simultaneously. In the proposed solution, scalability and membership anonymity are achieved via a novel design that integrates both ciphertextpolicy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and centralized flat table (CFT) techniques. In our design, multicast groups are specified through group member attributes represented through binary <b>member</b> <b>ID</b> only and thus achieves scalability. Also, high level of membership anonymity is guaranteed such that every group member knows nothing but his own group membership only. The proposed solution is also efficient in communication, that is, the ciphertext size is only O(n), where n is the length of a group <b>member</b> <b>ID</b> and independent to the group size. 1...|$|R

40|$|A <b>clearing</b> <b>member</b> of a Central Counterparty (CCP) {{is exposed}} to losses on their default fund and initial margin contributions. Such losses can be {{incurred}} whenever the CCP has insufficient funds to unwind the portfolio of a defaulting <b>clearing</b> <b>member.</b> This does not necessarily require the default of the CCP itself. In this note we aim to quantify the risk a financial institution has when facing a CCP. We show that a <b>clearing</b> <b>member’s</b> CCP risk is given by a sum of exposures {{to each of the}} other <b>clearing</b> <b>members.</b> This arises because of the implicit default insurance that each member has provided in the form of mutualised, loss sharing collateral. We calculate the exposures by explicitly modeling the capital structure of a CCP as well as the loss distributions of the individual member portfolios. An important consideration in designing the model is the limited transparency with respect to the portfolio composition and collateral levels of individual <b>clearing</b> <b>members.</b> To overcome this we leverage the fact that, for a typical CCP, margin levels are risk-based. In particular, we parameterise the portfolio loss tail as a Pareto distribution and we calibrate this to the CCP defined probability of losses exceeding the posted initial margin levels. A key aspect of the model is that we explicitly take into account wrong-way risk, i. e. the fact that member defaults are more likely to occur in stressed market conditions, as well as potential contagion between a member’s default and the losses on his portfolio. Opinions expressed in this paper are those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the view of JP Morgan. We would like to thank Andrew Abrahams for originating the project on CCP risk and for shaping many of the key ideas. We also thank Regis Guichard, Joe Holderness, Mitchell Smith, Marnie Rosenberg and Rajalakshmi Ramanath for valuable discussions. a...|$|R
