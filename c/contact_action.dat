5000|$|Generally speaking, {{anything}} {{that increases the}} rate of a process is a [...] "catalyst", a term derived from Greek , meaning [...] "to annul," [...] or [...] "to untie," [...] or [...] "to pick up." [...] The concept of catalysis was invented by chemist Elizabeth Fulhame and described in a 1794 book, based on her novel work in oxidation-reduction experiments. The term catalysis was later used by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1835 to describe reactions that are accelerated by substances that remain unchanged after the reaction. Fulhame, who predated Berzelius, did work with water as opposed to metals in her reduction experiments. Other 18th century chemists who worked in catalysis were Eilhard Mitscherlich who {{referred to it as}} contact processes, and Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner who spoke of <b>contact</b> <b>action.</b> He developed Döbereiner's lamp, a lighter based on hydrogen and a platinum sponge, which became a commercial success in the 1820s that lives on today. Humphry Davy discovered the use of platinum in catalysis. In the 1880s, Wilhelm Ostwald at Leipzig University started a systematic investigation into reactions that were catalyzed by the presence of acids and bases, and found that chemical reactions occur at finite rates and that these rates can be used to determine the strengths of acids and bases. For this work, Ostwald was awarded the 1909 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we {{consider}} a structure constituted by ‘long’ Euler beams forming two mutually intersecting arrays and interacting via internal pivots - which we call pantographic 2 D lattices. For this structure, small deformations - but possibly large displacements - can be considered. We performed numerical simulations concerning 2 D pantographic sheets of rectangular shape with two families of beam arrays cutting at 90 degrees. The set of theoretical tools needed to describe the continuous limit for such kind of structures goes beyond classical continuum mechanics. In particular, non-Cauchy <b>contact</b> <b>actions</b> can arise in the considered context.

40|$|The most {{general and}} elegant axiomatic {{framework}} on which continuum mechanics can be based starts from the Principle of Virtual Works (or Virtual Power). This Principle, which {{was most likely}} used already {{at the very beginning}} of the development of mechanics (see e. g. Benvenuto (1981), Vailati (1897), Colonnetti (1953), Russo (2003)), became after D'Alembert the main tool for an efficient formulation of physical theories. Also in continuum mechanics it has been adopted soon (see e. g. Benvenuto (1981), Salencon (1988), Germain (1973), Berdichevsky (2009), Maugin (1980), Forest (2006)). Indeed the Principle of Virtual Works becomes applicable in continuum mechanics once one recognizes that to estimate the work expended on regular virtual displacement fields of a continuous body one needs a distribution (in the sense of Schwartz). Indeed in the present paper we prove, also by using concepts from differential geometry of embedded Riemanniam manifolds, that the Representation Theorem for Distributions allows for an e ective characterization of the <b>contact</b> <b>actions</b> which may arise in N-th order strain-gradient multipolar continua (as defi ned by Green and Rivlin (1964)), by univocally distinguishing them in actions (forces and n-th order forces) concentrated on contact surfaces, lines (edges) and points (wedges). The used approach reconsiders the results found in the pioneering papers by Green and Rivlin (1964) -(1965), Toupin (1962), Mindlin (1964) -(1965) and Casal (1961) as systematized, for second gradient models, by Paul Germain (1973). Finally, by recalling the results found in dell'Isola and Seppecher (1995) -(1997), we indicate how Euler-Cauchy approach to <b>contact</b> <b>actions</b> and the celebrated tetrahedron argument may be adapted to N-th order strain-gradient multipolar continua...|$|R

Pitch misalignment causes ‘superimposed palisade’ wear marks and micro cracks near tooth roots. Compared with metal gears, the effects of small pitch angle on acetal gears are insignificant which may be linked closely to polymer's low elastic modulus.

Molecular dynamics simulation is an effective method to describe microscopic phenomena. Therefore, Molecular dynamics method was used to study mechanical behavior of contact surface of nanoscale sliding friction. A molecular dynamics model of hemisphere sphere sliding on rectangular solid plane was built. State change of the micro contact area and friction force variation in the process of sliding friction were observed and analyzed after solution and simulation.

The deeper the contact depth is, the greater the atoms close-packed accumulation is, and the greater the contact deformation is. In the process of sliding friction, the contact surface of the basal body has produced lattice destruction, surface upheaval and silicon atoms close-packed accumulation, and then formed furrow scratches. At the same time the silicon atoms of the hemisphere generated atomic migration obviously and adhered on the basal body surface. The top of the hemisphere was torn and peeled, which resulted in wear.

40|$|The {{choice of}} an {{appropriate}} {{model for the}} description of the structural behavior of masonry structuresis a focal point in the design of structural interventions. The difficulties that can be encountered are justifiedby the complex physical nature of masonries and the rules of thumb which are at the base of theirbuilding techniques and gave rise {{to a wide variety of}} artifacts over time. One of the most convincingways to investigate the mechanical behaviour of masonries consists in describing the assembly as a systemof blocks interacting through deformable interfaces ([1]–[2]). However, this approach rapidly becomesso numerically cumbersome as to call for equivalent continua formulations ([3]–[7]). Assuming that the system is periodic, a representative volume element (module) is chosen, which is large enough to be a representative part of the discrete system and sufficiently small to take advantage of the localizationtheorem. The constitutive relationships are determined by requiring the equivalence between the mean work of the <b>contact</b> <b>actions</b> of the module and the internal density work of the continuum which occupies the same region of space. The applicability of the present approach relies on the possibility to describe masonries as a discrete system where the interfaces dominate the gross behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Non-linear Cosserat and Cauchy {{anisotropic}} continua {{equivalent to}} masonry-like materials, like brick/block masonry, jointed rocks, granular materials or matrix/particle composites, are presented. An integral procedure of equivalence {{in terms of}} mechanical power has been adopted to identify the effective elastic moduli of the two continuous models starting from a Lagrangian system of interacting rigid elements. Non-linear constitutive functions for the interactions in the Lagrangian system are defined {{in order to take}} into account both the low capability to carry tension and the friction at the interfaces between elements. The non-linear problem is solved through a finite element procedure based on the iterative adjustment of the continuum constitutive tensor due to the occurrence of some limit situation involving the <b>contact</b> <b>actions</b> of the discrete model. Differences between the classical and the micropolar model are investigated with the aid of numerical analyses carried out on masonry walls made of blocks of different size. The capability of the micropolar continuum to discern, unlike the classical continuum, the behaviour of systems made of elements of different size is pointed out. It is also shown that for anisotropic materials, even in the elastic case, the micropolar solution in general does not tend to the classical solution when the size of the elements vanishes...|$|R
40|$|After its {{introduction}} {{in the early}} 1960 s, maize (silage) became the largest arable crop in the Netherlands. It is often grown in monoculture or in rotation with grass leys as in {{a large part of}} Europe too. Its introduction and monoculture induced weed shifts. Although initially not considered problematic, the C 4 species Setaria viridis and Digitaria ischaemum became more prominent due to changing crop husbandry systems since the mid 1990 s. Tolerance of these weeds to triazines and metolachlor forced farmers to adapt weed control strategies, i. e. use of herbicides with other modes of action. Also, reduced nutrient input, earlier sowing dates, and low tillage caused a slower early crop development and increased the need for adequate weed control in general. In today's herbicide portfolio in the Netherlands, control of S. viridis and D. ischaemum is marked as being most efficient with dimethenamide-P, isoxaflutole, S-metolachlor, and topramezone. The last one compound has a much higher degree of <b>contact</b> <b>action</b> than the predominant soil acting former three. This gives topramezone a rather unique position and, thus, Dutch crop advisors claim topramezone to be indispensable. In neighbouring countries the situation is comparable to the Dutch situation.

It is a parasitic protozoan disease, belongs to the genus Cryptosporidium type Apicomplexa. About 20 species of Cryptosporidium are revealed and known now. The incubation period of cryptosporidiosis lasts from 4 to 14 days. The main and most typical clinical manifestation of the disease — a profuse watery diarrhea, as well as clinically possible cryptosporidiosis of the biliary tract and broncho-pulmonary (respiratory) cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidiosis diagnosis is based on laboratory studies of faeces (in vivo) and pathological material (posthumously), taking into account epizootic, clinical and postmortem data. Causal treatment is not developed. But it is possible to control the diarrhea caused by this infection. Specific preventive management of cryptosporidiosis is not developed. Personal hygiene measures are necessary. The 6 th most dangerous food parasitosis is Entamoeba histolytica. This intestinal protozoa disease is characterized by ulcerative lesions of the colon, chronic protracted course with the risk of the formation of abscesses in the liver and various organs. The causative agent of ame­biasis — Entamoeba histolytica — belongs to the genus Entamoeba, family Entamoebidae, the simplest type — Protozoa. According to the recommendations of the WHO Expert Committee (1970), there are three clinical forms of amebiasis: intestinal, extra-intestinal and skin. Diagnostic microscopy of the native smears of fresh feces in saline solution and smears stained with Lugol’s solution is carried out. In the presence of clinical signs of intestinal amebiasis and negative results of parasitological studies, serological tests are used based on the detection of specific antibodies against Entamoeba.
