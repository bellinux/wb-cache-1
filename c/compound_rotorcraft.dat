50|$|Rotorcraft, or rotary-wing aircraft, use a {{spinning}} rotor with aerofoil section blades (a rotary wing) to provide lift. Types include helicopters, autogyros, and various hybrids such as gyrodynes and <b>compound</b> <b>rotorcraft.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Compound</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> have wings {{that provide}} {{some or all}} of the lift in forward flight. They are {{nowadays}} classified as powered lift types and not as rotorcraft. Tiltrotor aircraft (such as the V-22 Osprey), tiltwing, tailsitter, and coleopter aircraft have their rotors/propellers horizontal for vertical flight and vertical for forward flight.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{technology}} of the company is the [...] "Slowed Rotor/Compound" [...] (SR/C) CarterCopter concept. A <b>compound</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> uses both wings and a rotor for lift. The wings support the aircraft when airspeed is high enough. [...] "Slowed rotor" [...] indicates that the rotor is then slowed down in high speed flight to reduce drag. Heavy tip weights made of lead, tungsten or steel are used to make jump takeoffs and keep the slowed rotor stable.|$|E
5000|$|A {{rotorcraft}} or {{rotary-wing aircraft}} is a heavier-than-air flying machine that uses lift generated by wings, called rotary wings or rotor blades, that revolve around a mast. Several rotor blades {{mounted on a}} single mast {{are referred to as}} a rotor. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines a rotorcraft as [...] "supported in flight by the reactions of the air on one or more rotors". Rotorcraft generally include those aircraft where one or more rotors are required to provide lift throughout the entire flight, such as helicopters, cyclocopters, autogyros, and gyrodynes. <b>Compound</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> may also include additional thrust engines or propellers and static lifting surfaces.|$|E
50|$|On 17 June 2005, the company's sole flying {{technology}} demonstrator reached a rotorcraft milestone, but crashed {{on the next}} flight. The aircraft had been flying at 160 mph when the drive pulley to the propeller drive-shaft bolts failed in flight, reversing propeller thrust. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair but both crew members were unharmed. The accident set the company's development back at least ten months as a small wingless autogyro was not flown until 2006, and the Carter PAV (a subsequent 4-place manned <b>compound</b> <b>rotorcraft,</b> the N110AV) was not flown until 2011. Design of the PAV was begun during 2005. Carter says it has flown 186 kn at 18,000 feet and reached a Mu of 1.13, and Carter has applied to the FAA to change the PAVs certificate from research and development to demonstration.|$|E
40|$|The {{rotorcraft}} {{industry has}} recently shown a {{new interest in}} <b>compound</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> as a feasible alternative to tackle {{the rapid growth of}} civil aviation activities and associated environmental impact. Indeed, aircraft contribution to the global emissions of CO 2 CO 2, NOxNOx, and noise are driving the development of innovative technologies and vehicles. At present, <b>compound</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> architectures are regarded by the industry as promising platforms that can potentially increase productivity at a reduced environmental cost. In order to quantify the benefits of <b>compound</b> <b>rotorcraft,</b> this paper details the performance analysis of a coaxial counter-rotating rotor configuration with a pusher propeller. A comprehensive approach targeting the assessment of the aforementioned rotorcraft design for civil applications is presented herein. The methodology developed encompasses a rotorcraft flight dynamics simulation module and an engine performance module, coupled with a gaseous emissions prediction tool for environmental impact studies. They have been integrated together to constitute a standalone performance simulation framework and verified with the performance calculations of Harrington's “rotor 1 ” and the Sikorsky X 2 TD. The method is then applied to evaluate the performance of a conceptual coaxial rotorcraft, during a notional inter-city air taxi mission, in terms of cruise altitude, speed, and range, overall mission time and environmental impact. The several trade-offs between these parameters highlight the need for an integrated optimisation process. Besides, the concept demonstrates the benefits of the <b>compound</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> architecture with a best range speed reaching 90 m/s leading to reduced response times and increase of round trips in a given time. As a consequence, operators will need fewer vehicles and heliports to cover the same areas. This outcome is highly attractive in the current growing market...|$|E
