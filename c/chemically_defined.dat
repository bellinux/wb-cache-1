25|$|A {{member of}} the loline {{alkaloids}} was first isolated from the grass Lolium temulentum and its elemental composition determined in 1892. It was initially named temuline and later renamed norloline. (Reviewed by Schardl et al. (2007).) Studies in the 1950s and 1960s by Russian researchers established the name loline and identified the characteristic 2,7 ether bridge in its molecular structure. Since then the analytical methods for purification {{and analysis of the}} lolines have been refined and several different loline species have been identified in many Lolium and related grasses infected by the Epichloë/Neotyphodium (epichloae) endophytes. Lolines are absent in grass plants that do not harbor the epichloae endophytes, and not all epichloae produce the lolines. Because of the very intimate association of plant and endophyte and difficulties to reproduce the symbiotic conditions in vitro, it was long unknown if the fungus was the producer of the lolines, or if they were synthesized by the plant in response to endophyte infection. In 2001, it was demonstrated that the endophyte Neotyphodium uncinatum produces lolines in some <b>chemically</b> <b>defined</b> growth media, which suggests that the endophyte is also the producer of the lolines in the grass plant. The lolines have also been reported from some plants in several plant families, suggesting a more widespread occurrence of these compounds in nature.|$|E

This work analyzes the differences found when scrutinizing the current trade standards and regulations from a critical viewpoint, with comments and useful tips for improving the current International Olive Council methods when possible, as well as alternatives from non targeted techniques. The values of precision associated with the International Olive Council methods are also examined and the need for re-validating methods to update the analytical quality parameters is discussed...|$|R
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} the adjuvant activity of rice oil (RO) on the immune response to ovalbumin (OVA), its depots and possible side effects at the injection sites. Immunization of mice with OVA emulsified in rice oil (OVA+RO) {{resulted in an}} antibody response significantly higher than that determined in mice immunized with soluble OVA. In addition, these high antibody levels were observed for a period as long as 6 weeks after immunization. However, the adjuvant action of RO was significantly lower to incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). In secondary immune response, the pattern of OVA-specific antibodies stimulated by RO was predominantly IgG 1. Despite of the significant humoral response enhanced by RO at no time was noted any lesions {{at the site of}} injection. Besides, histological analysis showed that inflammatory reaction caused by RO was mild and transient, suggesting that RO appears to be a safe, effective and <b>chemically</b> <b>define</b> alternative to IFA in many situations...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the problems presented by lignin to animal production, particularly {{in countries with}} hot climates, where the degree of lignification in plants is extremely variable causing unpredictable reductions in digestibility. The difficulty of <b>chemically</b> <b>defining</b> lignin compounds is reviewed with the conclusion {{that a combination of}} traditional and advanced techniques is required if the biological role of the lignin in the plant is to be explained. Experiments in ruminants have often shown incomplete recovery of compounds traditionally referred to as lignin, leading to the suspicion that a limited digestion of lignin could occur under anaerobic conditions, with fungi playing a predominant role in the process. As is well known, the problem is difficult to study in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. White-rot fungi - Phanerochaete chrysosporium - has become a standard model for in vitro aerobic digestion. The in situ technique appears to be the most suitable for studies under anaerobic conditions, and some results are presented indicating apparent lignin digestibility in forages...|$|R

40|$|The present {{studies were}} aimed at further characterizing the {{interaction}} between basement membrane molecules and normal cultured human keratinocytes because of the intimate association between basal keratinocytes and the basement membrane. The studies show that keratinocytes adhere to type IV collagen-coated substrata {{to a greater degree}} than substrata coated with similar concentrations of fibronectin and laminin. To further define cell-binding regions within type IV collagen, studies were performed using purified pepsin-generated triple helical fragments of type IV collagen and show that keratinocytes bind to sites within the triple-helical region of type IV collagen. To delineate specific cell adhesion promoting sequences, we studied a series of chemically synthesized peptides derived from the triple-helical region of type IV collagen. One peptide, designated Hep III, which is thirteen amino acids in length and binds heparin, was active in directly promoting keratinocyte adhesion. Furthermore, in competition assays, this peptide in solution was shown to inhibit keratinocyte adhesion to substrata coated with Hep Ill or intact type IV collagen. These studies show that keratinocytes hind directly to type IV collagen and <b>chemically</b> <b>define</b> a major cell-adhesion -promoting site within the triple-helical region...|$|R

50|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between serum-free media and <b>chemically</b> <b>defined</b> media. Serum-free media may contain undefined animal-derived products such as serum albumin (purified from blood), hydrolysates, growth factors, hormones, carrier proteins, and attachment factors. These undefined animal-derived products will contain complex contaminants, such as the lipid content of albumin. In contrast, <b>chemically</b> <b>defined</b> media require that all of the components must be identified and have their exact concentrations known. Therefore, a <b>chemically</b> <b>defined</b> medium must be entirely free of animal-derived components and cannot contain either fetal bovine serum, bovine serum albumin or human serum albumin. To achieve this, <b>chemically</b> <b>defined</b> media is commonly supplemented with recombinant versions of albumin and growth factors, usually derived from rice or E. coli, or synthetic chemical such as the polymer polyvinyl alcohol which can reproduce some of the functions of BSA/HSA.|$|E

40|$|The species Astronium urundeuva (Allemao) Engl. and Astronium graveolens Jacq., {{which are}} used in Brazilian folk {{medicine}} to treat allergies, inflammation, diarrhea and ulcers, were investigated for their composition. The {{aim of this study}} was to define a rapid and reliable analytical approach, based on the flow-injection analysis-electrospray ionization-ion trap-tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-ESI-IT-MS-MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization- time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF-MS), to investigate the full range of hydrolyzable tannins present in the extracts of these Astronium species. The MALDI-ToF-MS analysis allowed us to ascertain the presence of hydrolysable tannins in both Astronium species as a series of gallotannins with degrees of polymerization of 7 to 13 galloyl units. Moreover, the analysis by FIA-ESI-IT-MS-MS, as well as confirming this result and <b>chemically</b> <b>defining</b> gallotannins as galloylglucose compounds, highlighted the presence of further classes of hydrolysable tannins, such as hexahydrodiphenoyl esters of glucose and some gallic acid derivatives, providing information about their structure by a careful study of their fragmentation patterns. Finally, the evaluation of the number of positional isomers of gallotannins occurring in both Astronium species was obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-IT-MS).

40|$|Heparin and heparan sulfate are {{structurally}} related polysaccharides with {{a variety}} of biological effects/functions. Most of these effects are due to interactions, of varying specificity, between the negatively charged polysaccharide chains and proteins. While such interactions generally involve a single saccharide domain of decasaccharide size or less, ternary complexes of two protein molecules binding to separate domains on a single polysaccharide chain are known to occur. To facilitate studies on domain organization and its importance for biological function a strategy was developed to <b>chemically</b> conjugate <b>defined</b> heparin oligomers in linear and chemoselective fashion. The procedure requires that the oligosaccharide to provide the reducing-terminal domain of the conjugate is generated by lyase degradation of a parent polysaccharide, whereas the nonreducing-terminal domain is obtained through deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by constructing a conjugate composed of two heparin 12 -mers, of which the reducing-terminal component contained the antithrombin-binding region, whereas the nonreducing-terminal domain did not.
