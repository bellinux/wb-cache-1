40|$|A {{fundamental}} network design {{problem is the}} one of Steiner Network Design. The goal is to design a network which is able to support a unit flow for each commodity, at a time, between its source-sink pair. When the flows are unsplittable, this corresponds to the Steiner forest problem and {{to the problem of}} sharing cost of the multicast by different users. As a result of greedy selfish behavior of users in the network design game, the overall quality of the resulting solution is often not as good as the globally optimum solution of the underlying problem. We are therefore interested in the problem of designing distributed cost sharing mechanisms that induce the selfish agents to converge to the near-optimum solutions.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} <b>sharing</b> the <b>cost</b> {{of a common}} {{infrastructure}} among a set of strategic and cooperating players {{has been the subject}} of intensive research in recent years. However, most of these studies consider cooperative <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> games in an offline setting, i. e., the mechanism knows all players and their respective input data in advance. In this paper, we consider cooperative <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> games in an online setting: Upon the arrival of a new player, the mechanism has to take instantaneous and irreversible decisions without any knowledge about players that arrive in the future. We propose an online model for general demand <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> games and give a complete characterization of both weakly group-strategyproof and group-strategyproof online <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for this model. Moreover, we present a simple method to derive incremental online <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> from online algorithms such that the competitive ratio is preserved. Based on our general results, we develop online <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for several binary demand and general demand <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> games. ...|$|R

METHOD the study was conducted in the period May-July 2009 with 150 participants aged over 18 years who attended the Health Center of Atalanti. Data were collected by personal interview using a questionnaire created for the purpose after an extensive literature review. Data analysis was conducted with the statistical package SPSS 15. 0, using t test, chi square test and logistic regression, with the level of statistical significance set at 0. 05. RESULTS almost half of the participants declared their willingness to participate in cost sharing by paying an extra fee, in order to receive upgraded health services. The factor that appeared {{to play a major role}} in the intent to participate in cost sharing was the type of health insurance. Specifically, participants who were insured by the Social Insurance Institution (IKA) reported being more willing to pay a small additional fee in order to gain upgraded health services, in a percentage of 63 %, and they had a probability of expressing willingness four times higher than that of those insured by any other scheme. People in higher socio-economic groups and younger age groups tended to be more positive. Finally, this study examined the net potential revenues that could be incurred with the introduction of a <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which were estimated to be € 184, 107. 4 for the first year and € 186, 357. 4 for the following years.

It was estimated that net revenues from the application of a <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanism</b> would be sufficient to fill some vacant positions with auxiliary doctors, but also to help purchase medical equipment and modernize the building infrastructure of the Health Center. © Athens Medical Society...|$|E

Shapley Value mechanism consist two models SH-TPM (Shapley Value Mechanism for the Tamper Proof Mode) and SH-ANM (Shapley Value Mechanism for the Autonomous Nodes Model). SH-TPM only calculates the payment and sends to root node. SH-ANM consist the auditing with probability so that there is the problem of cheating node may remain undetected. In SH-ANM-E (Extended SH-ANM), node verifies the computation of cost share value of parent by parent and so in verification it detects the cheated node. We study these mechanisms and evaluate the SH-ANM with the SH-ANM-E mechanism. We propose the penalty approach in phase 2 (Top down Phase) of SH-ANM-E Mechanism. By giving the penalty to cheated node, we can bind the nodes not to deviate from the mechanisms. We compare the Phase 2 of SH-ANM and phase 2 of proposed SH-ANM-E mechanism.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a combinatorial {{variant of the}} cost sharing problem: several services can be provided to each player and each player values every combination of services differently. A publicly known cost function specifies the cost of providing every possible combination of services. A combinatorial <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is a protocol that decides which services each player gets and at what price. We look for dominant strategy mechanisms that are (economically) efficient and cover the cost, ideally without overcharging (i. e., budget balanced). Note that unlike the standard cost sharing setting, combinatorial cost sharing is a multi-parameter domain. This makes designing dominant strategy mechanisms with good guarantees a challenging task. We present the Potential Mechanism [...] {{a combination of the}} VCG mechanism and a well-known tool from the theory of cooperative games: Hart and Mas-Colell's potential function. The potential mechanism is a dominant strategy mechanism that always covers the incurred cost. When the cost function is subadditive the same mechanism is also approximately efficient. Our main technical contribution shows that when the cost function is submodular the potential mechanism is approximately budget balanced in three settings: supermodular valuations, symmetric cost function and general symmetric valuations, and two players with general valuations...|$|E

How large can the sum of the players ’ costs be, compared to the cost of a “socially optimal” solution, defined to be a minimum Steiner tree connecting the players to the root?
