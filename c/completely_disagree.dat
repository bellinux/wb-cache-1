The probate judges of several counties in Alabama have stopped issuing marriage licenses to anyone. Probate Judge Nick Williams of Washington County, Alabama, said he stopped issuing licenses altogether to avoid discrimination and said, [...] "I <b>completely</b> <b>disagree</b> with the authority the Supreme Court has." [...] Probate Judge John Enslen of Elmore County, Alabama, said the federal government, not state probate offices, should be the entity issuing same-sex marriage licenses. Casey Davis (unrelated to Kim Davis), a clerk in Casey County, Kentucky, said, [...] "We've not tried to prevent same-sex marriages, we've only tried to exercise our First Amendment rights", adding that such applicants could apply in other counties. Kay Schwartz, a clerk in Whitley County, Kentucky, felt oppressed: [...] "There's a law against bullying... Why take away the majority's right [...] to give the minority their rights?" [...] She suggested the possibility of other options {{to meet the needs}} of same-sex applicants, such as an online service. The ACLU has no plans for legal action against other court clerks or probate judges. National attention has not been on them as the ACLU brought no case against them, speculated University of Kentucky political science professor D.B.

50|$|Helvetius, {{a friend}} of Diderot, was a freethinker; many of his views were also the views of Diderot. The two shared a common {{acceptance}} of philosophical materialism, and in many respects their views on metaphysics were identical. The fundamental disagreement boiled down to a few issues on which Diderot was in vehement disagreement with Helvetius. First, Helvetius proposed that human behavior is indistinguishable from animal behavior since both humans and animals obtain knowledge through the five senses. Here, Diderot agreed with Helvetius that humans are a species of animals, and animals are not automata; however, he <b>completely</b> <b>disagreed</b> with the view that studying animal behavior can yield insights into human behavior.|$|R

50|$|The utopia and its derivative, the dystopia, are {{genres of}} {{literature}} that explore {{social and political}} structures. Utopian fiction portrays a setting that agrees with the author's ethos, having various attributes of another reality intended to appeal to readers. Dystopian (or dystopic) fiction (sometimes combined with, but distinct from apocalyptic literature) is the opposite: the portrayal of a setting that <b>completely</b> <b>disagrees</b> with the author's ethos. Many novels combine both, often {{as a metaphor for}} the different directions humanity can take, depending on its choices, ending up with one of two possible futures. Both utopias and dystopias are commonly found in science fiction and other speculative fiction genres, and arguably are by definition a type of speculative fiction.|$|R

Parents' attitudes toward homosexuality during one's youth strongly affect one's attitude toward same-sex marriage. The strongest determinant is socialization within religious institutions.

This study aims to investigate what is the users’ opinion about IAASBs new audit reporting proposals regarding the revision of the ISA 570 – Going Concern. This proposal comes after several scandals related to audit reporting on going concern have decreased user confidence in the audit profession. We achieve this objective by examining comment letters sent to the IAASB by respondents from the EU.

Still, most users salute the revision process and urge the IAASB to closely work with other bodies for this matter.
