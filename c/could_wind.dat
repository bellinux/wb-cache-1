25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{armistice}} (25 June 1940) France {{had been allowed}} to retain the French Navy, the Marine Nationale, under strict conditions. The PÃ©tain government pledged that the fleet would never fall into German hands, but refused to send the fleet beyond Germany's reach, either to Britain, or even to far away territories of the French Empire, such as the West Indies. This was not enough security for Winston Churchill, who feared that the French fleet <b>could</b> <b>wind</b> up in German hands and be used against British ships, which were vital to maintaining worldwide shipping and communications.|$|E

[...] Martin commented on {{the ending of the}} show, stating that a [...] "broken Kazuchika Okada shambling tearfully back towards the locker room... made the moment feel real" [...] which displayed that [...] "Okada isn't just a great athlete but a better actor than most who step into the ring, and elevating the entire scripted, choreographed display into something beyond a sport."

2500|$|Media personalities {{have weighed}} in on the confrontations. During the standoff, Bundy was interviewed (via remote link) by {{television}} host Sean Hannity. Hannity stated that some fear events <b>could</b> <b>wind</b> up mirroring the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge and said, [...] "This is public land, and it's not being used, in my mind, and I'm not a rancher, (but) I would think the federal government might be thankful because you're cutting the lawn for free, and they're charging huge amounts of money, right, to let your cattle graze there with these fees". In contrast, a comparison of BLM grazing fees with private land market prices demonstrated the Bundy's are getting a 93% discount by grazing on BLM land.|$|E
2500|$|Kiki and Morgan's reunion is {{short-lived}} due to {{the fact}} that she discovers he has been sleeping with Ava behind her back. While the actress is aware of the unfolding bipolar storyline for the character of Morgan, Kiki knows nothing of this -- [...] "She just thinks he is cheating on her." [...] While Kiki does notice some odd behavior and mood swings, there isn't enough to clue her in that something more is going on. Co-head writer Shelly Altman said that Kiki and Morgan could [...] "help one another heal" [...] or [...] "they <b>could</b> <b>wind</b> up feeding off of each other's worst impulses." [...] According to Jean Passanante, the potential to hurt one another again worries Kiki as they get close again. However it is because of their mutual history that seem [...] "they understand each other." [...] Altman said Morgan's bipolar diagnosis aids in helping Kiki thaw toward Morgan.|$|E

60|$|It {{required}} but a {{few moments}} for the ape-man to clothe himself in the tights, sandals, and parrot emblazoned yellow tunic of the dead soldier. Around his waist he buckled the saber belt but beneath the tunic he retained the hunting knife of his dead father. His other weapons he could not lightly discard, and so, {{in the hope that}} he might eventually recover them, he carried them {{to the edge of the}} wall and dropped them among the foliage at its base. At the last moment he found it difficult to part with his rope, which, with his knife, was his most accustomed weapon, and one which he had used for the greatest length of time. He found that by removing the saber belt he <b>could</b> <b>wind</b> the rope about his waist beneath his tunic, and then replacing the belt still retain it entirely concealed from chance observation.|$|E
60|$|Sir Peregrine {{knew that}} it would not be right. Though he was old, and weak in body, and infirm in purpose, his {{judgment}} had not altogether left him. He was well aware that he would offend all social laws if he were to do that which he contemplated, and ask the world around him to respect as Lady Orme--as his wife, the woman who had so deeply disgraced herself. But yet he could hardly bring himself to confess that it was impossible. He was as a child who knows that a coveted treasure is beyond his reach, but still covets it, still longs for it, hoping against hope that it may yet be his own. It seemed to him that he might yet regain his old vitality if he <b>could</b> <b>wind</b> his arm once more about her waist, and press her to his side, and call her his own. It would be so sweet to forgive her; to make her sure that she was absolutely forgiven; to teach her that there was one at least who would not bring up against her her past sin, even in his memory. As for his grandson, the property should be abandoned to him altogether. 'Twas thus he argued with himself; but yet, as he argued, he {{knew that it}} could not be so.|$|E

60|$|For this {{employment}} he was {{in every}} way well suited--unless {{it was in the}} matter of finance. Though he had in his very earliest manly years given such great offence by indifference to his family politics, and had in a certain degree fostered the ill-feeling by contesting the county in opposition to the wishes of his brother squires, nevertheless, he bore a loved and popular name. Men regretted that he should not have been what they wished him to be, that he should not have been such as was the old squire; but when they found that such was the case, that he could not be great among them as a politician, they were still willing that he should be great in any other way if there were county greatness for which he was suited. Now he was known as an excellent horseman, as a thorough sportsman, as one knowing in dogs, and tender-hearted as a sucking mother to a litter of young foxes; he had ridden in the county since he was fifteen, had a fine voice for a view-hallo, knew every hound by name, and <b>could</b> <b>wind</b> a horn with sufficient music for all hunting purposes; moreover, he had come to his property, as was well known through all Barsetshire, with a clear income of fourteen thousand a year.|$|E
60|$|When he died it {{was with}} an {{injunction}} to his wife not to bring up Ludmilla to the stage {{now that he was}} not there to take care of her. With the means he had left she had set up her shop at Rockquay, and though she had never been an affectionate mother, Ludmilla had been fairly happy, and had been a favourite with Mr. Flight and the school authorities, and had been thoroughly imbued with their spirit. A change had, however, come over her mother ever since an expedition to Avoncester, when she had met O'Leary. She had probably always contrived a certain amount of illicit trade in tobacco and spirits by means of the sailors in the foreign traders who put into the little harbour of Rockquay; but her daughter was scarcely cognizant of this, and would not have understood the evil if she had done so, nor did it affect her life. O'Leary had, however, been the clown in Mr. Schnetterling's troupe, and had become partner with Jellicoe. The sight of him revived all Zoraya's Bohemian inclinations, and on his side he knew her to have still great capabilities, and recollected enough of her little daughter to be sure that she would be a valuable possession. Moreover, Mrs. Schnetterling had carried her contraband traffic a little too far, especially where the boys of the preparatory school were concerned. She began to fear the gauger and the policeman, and she had consented to marry O'Leary at the Avoncester register office, meaning to keep the matter a secret until she <b>could</b> <b>wind</b> up her affairs at Rockquay. Even her daughter was kept in ignorance.|$|E
60|$|Nothing in {{fact was}} {{stranger}} {{than the way}} in which, when she had remained there a little, her companions, watched by her {{through one of the}} windows, actually struck her as almost consciously and gratefully safer. They might have been--really charming as they showed in the beautiful room, and Charlotte certainly, as always, magnificently handsome and supremely distinguished--they might have been figures rehearsing some play of which she herself was the author; they might even, for the happy appearance they continued to present, have been such figures as would, by the strong note of character in each, fill any author with the certitude of success, especially of their own histrionic. They might in short have represented any mystery they would; the point being predominantly that the key to the mystery, the key that <b>could</b> <b>wind</b> and unwind it without a snap of the spring, was there in her pocket--or rather, no doubt, clasped at this crisis in her hand and pressed, as she walked back and forth, to her breast. She walked to the end and far out of the light; she returned and saw the others still where she had left them; she passed round the house and looked into the drawing-room, lighted also, but empty now, and seeming to speak the more, in its own voice, of all the possibilities she controlled. Spacious and splendid, like a stage again awaiting a drama, it was a scene she might people, by the press of her spring, either with serenities and dignities and decencies, or with terrors and shames and ruins, things as ugly as those formless fragments of her golden bowl she was trying so hard to pick up.|$|E
