40|$|The {{real-time}} vehicle routing {{problem with}} time windows and simultaneous delivery products and pickup wastage materials (RT-VRPTWDPPWM) is formulated as extension of VRP. The real-time delivery/pickup demands are served by capacitated vehicles with limited initial loads. Moreover, pickup services aren’t necessarily done after delivery services in each route. A improved genetic algorithm (master-slave genetic algorithm) is proposed. To generate offspring {{for the next generation}} for <b>crossover</b> (<b>Sub</b> Route Sequence Crossover Method (SRSCM) and for mutation (Sub Route Alter Mutation Method (SRAMM) methods are introduced. The results shows that the proposed algorithm can efficiently decrease the total route cost. Results of comparative tests are presented showing that the improved algorithm performs well on large populations...|$|E
40|$|Well ER- 20 - 11 was drilled for the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office {{in support}} of the Nevada Environmental Management Operations Underground Test Area (UGTA) Activity at the Nevada National Security Site (formerly Nevada Test Site), Nye County, Nevada. The well was drilled in September 2012 as part of the Central and Western Pahute Mesa Corrective Action Unit Phase II {{drilling}} program. Well ER- 20 - 11 was constructed to further investigate {{the nature and extent of}} radionuclidecontaminated groundwater encountered in two nearby UGTA wells, to help define hydraulic and transport parameters for the contaminated Benham aquifer, and to provide data for the UGTA hydrostratigraphic framework model. The 44. 5 -centimeter (cm) surface hole was drilled to a depth of 520. 0 meters (m) and cased with 34. 0 -cm casing to 511. 5 m. The hole diameter was then decreased to 31. 1 cm, and the borehole was drilled to a total depth of 915. 6 m. The hole was completed to allow access for hydrologic testing and sampling in the target aquifer, which is a lava-flow aquifer known as the Benham aquifer. The completion casing string, set to the depth of 904. 3 m, consists of a string of 6 ⅝-inch (in.) stainless-steel casing hanging from a string of 7 ⅝-in. carbon-steel casing. The stainless-steel casing has one slotted interval at 796. 3 to 903. 6 m. One piezometer string was installed, which consists of 2 ⅞-in. stainless-steel tubing that hangs from 2 ⅜-in. carbon-steel tubing via a <b>crossover</b> <b>sub.</b> This string was landed at 903. 8 m and is slotted in the interval 795. 3 to 903. 1 m. Data collected during and shortly after hole construction include composite drill cuttings samples collected every 3. 0 m, various geophysical logs, fluid samples (for groundwater chemistry analysis and tritium measurements), and water-level measurements. The well penetrated 915. 6 m of Tertiary volcanic rock, including one saturated lava flow aquifer. Measurements on samples taken from the undeveloped well indicated elevated tritium levels within the Benham aquifer. The maximum tritium level measured with field equipment was 146, 131 picocuries per liter from a sample obtained at the depth of 912. 0 m. The fluid level was measured in the piezometer string at a depth of 504. 5 m on September 26, 2012. All Fluid Management Plan (FMP) requirements for Well ER- 20 - 11 were met. Analysis of monitoring samples and FMP confirmatory samples indicated that fluids generated during drilling at Well ER- 20 - 11 met the FMP criteria for discharge to an unlined sump or designated infiltration area. Well development, hydrologic testing, and sampling will be conducted at a later date...|$|E
40|$|Model Evaluation Well ER- 11 - 2 was drilled for the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office {{in support}} of Nevada Environmental Management Operations at the Nevada National Security Site (formerly known as the Nevada Test Site). The well was drilled in August 2012 {{as part of a}} model {{evaluation}} program in the Frenchman Flat area of Nye County, Nevada. The primary purpose of the well was to provide detailed geologic, hydrogeologic, chemical, and radionuclide data {{that can be used to}} test and build confidence in the applicability of the Frenchman Flat Corrective Action Unit flow and transport models for their intended purpose. In particular, this well was designed to provide data to evaluate the uncertainty in model forecasts of contaminant migration from the upgradient underground nuclear test PIN STRIPE, conducted in borehole U- 11 b in 1966. Well ER- 11 - 2 will provide information that can be used to refine the Phase II Frenchman Flat hydrostratigraphic framework model if necessary, as well as to support future groundwater flow and transport modeling. The main 31. 1 -centimeter (cm) hole was drilled to a total depth of 399. 6 meters (m). A completion casing string was not set in Well ER- 11 - 2. However, a piezometer string was installed in the 31. 1 -cm open hole. The piezometer is composed of 7. 3 -cm stainless-steel tubing hung on 6. 0 -cm carbon-steel tubing via a <b>crossover</b> <b>sub.</b> The piezometer string was landed at 394. 5 m, for monitoring the lower tuff confining unit. Data collected during and shortly after hole construction include composite drill cuttings samples collected every 3. 0 m, various geophysical logs, water quality (including tritium and other test-related radionuclides) measurements, and water level measurements. The well penetrated 42. 7 m of Quaternary and Tertiary alluvium and 356. 9 m of Tertiary volcanic rock. The water-level measured in the piezometer string on September 25, 2012, was 353. 8 m below ground surface. No tritium above levels detectable by field methods were encountered in this hole. No well development or hydrologic testing was conducted in this well immediately after completion, and future well development, sampling, and hydrologic testing planned for this well will be limited due to the diameter of the piezometer string. The stratigraphy, general lithology, and the water level are as expected, but the section of geology encountered is higher than expected due to faulting. No tritium above the minimum detection limit of the field equipment was detected because the target aquifer (the Topopah Spring aquifer) at Well ER- 11 - 2 is structurally higher than expected and thus unsaturated...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a NP-Complete and a multi-objective problem. The problem {{involves}} optimizing a {{fleet of}} vehicles that are to serve a number of customers from a central depot. Each vehicle has limited capacity and each customer has a certain demand.

40|$|Lifestyle {{diseases}} such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, cancer, type 2 diabetes are the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The prevalence of these diseases is high in New Zealand as well. It is believed that promoting a healthy diet and increased physical activity can make beneficial changes and extend the healthy life expectancy. This twelve week study with follow-up at 52 weeks was designed to demonstrate if a diet and physical activity group intervention in the workplace would result in changes in risk factors for antioxidant damage and therefore reduce the risk for lifestyle diseases. The effect of the addition of kiwifruit to the diet on markers of oxidative stress was also measured in a <b>crossover</b> <b>sub</b> study within this study. Fifty two healthy subjects (male 24, female 28, mean age 46), completed the 12 week study with measurements points being at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks. Thirty eight subjects presented for another set of measurements at 52 weeks. The intervention started at week 3 and the kiwifruit crossover treatment was launched between weeks 6 and 12. Ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay was utilized to measure the changes in plasma antioxidant activity(AOA) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay to measure the changes in plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), as a marker of lipid peroxidation (LP) at each measurement point. Since almost all participants had a normal range of baseline measurements of plasma AOA and LP (plasma MDA), they were categorized as relatively low and high AOA (1200 micromol/L cut off point) and LP groups (1. 70 mmol/L cut off point), as well as divided into male and female groups. The effect of changed diet and increased physical activity during the 12 week study period resulted in a significant increase (P< 0. 05) in plasma AOA. The changes were much higher in low AOA group (P= 0. 005) and in male subjects (P< 0. 005), while no changes were observed in subjects with already high AOA at baseline. The increased plasma AOA level was maintained and increased even more over the year. No changes were observed in LP (plasma MDA). The effect of kiwifruit on the markers of oxidative stress was modest, the 3 -week daily kiwifruit consumption (2 - 3 kiwifruit per day) resulted in significant increase (P= 0. 01) in plasma AOA only in female subjects within the low AOA group. However, the precision {{and validity of the}} measurements were limited by a possible loss of vitamin C due to storage of the plasma samples rather than analysis when fresh. Given that kiwifruit is particularly high in vitamin C the effect of the addition of kiwifruit to the diet might not have been detected. In this study it was shown that a group diet and physical activity intervention within the workplace can increase the level of plasma antioxidant activity and thereby reduce the risk for oxidative stress and related lifestyle diseases...|$|E
40|$|Well ER-EC- 11 was drilled for the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office, {{in support}} of the Nevada Environmental Restoration Project at the Nevada National Security Site (formerly Nevada Test Site), Nye County, Nevada. The well was drilled in September and October 2009 as part of the Pahute Mesa Phase II {{drilling}} program. A main objective was to investigate radionuclide migration down-gradient from Well Cluster ER- 20 - 5 and Well ER- 20 - 7 and across the northern Timber Mountain moat structural zone into the area referred to as the Bench, between Pahute Mesa and the Timber Mountain caldera complex. A secondary purpose of the well was to provide detailed hydrogeologic information for the shallow- to intermediate-depth Tertiary volcanic section in the Bench area. This well also provided detailed hydrogeologic information in the Tertiary volcanic section to reduce uncertainties within the Pahute Mesa-Oasis Valley hydrostratigraphic framework model (Bechtel Nevada, 2002). The main 52. 1 -centimeter hole was drilled to a depth of 507. 5 meters and then opened to a diameter of 66. 0 centimeters. It was cased with 50. 8 -centimeter casing to 504. 9 meters. The hole diameter was then decreased to 47. 0 centimeters, and drilling continued to a total depth of 979. 3 meters. It was then cased with 34. 0 -centimeter casing set at 965. 5 meters. The hole diameter was then decreased to 31. 1 centimeters and the borehole was drilled to a total depth of 1, 264. 3 meters. The completion casing string, set to the depth of 1, 262. 5 meters, consists of 19. 4 -centimeter stainless-steel casing hanging from 19. 4 -centimeter carbon-steel casing. The stainless-steel casing has two slotted intervals open to the Tiva Canyon and Topopah Spring aquifers. Four piezometer strings were installed in Well ER-EC- 11. A string of carbon-steel 6. 0 -centimeter tubing with one slotted interval was inserted outside the 50. 8 -centimeter casing, within the 66. 0 -centimeter borehole for access to the Timber Mountain aquifer, and landed at 475. 3 meters. A second string of 6. 0 -centimeter tubing with one slotted interval was inserted outside the 34. 0 -centimeter casing, within the 47. 0 -centimeter borehole for access to the Benham aquifer, and landed at 911. 7 meters. A third piezometer string consists of 7. 3 -centimeter stainless-steel tubing that hangs from 6. 0 -centimeter carbon-steel tubing via a <b>crossover</b> <b>sub.</b> This string was landed at 1, 029. 5 meters to monitor the Tiva Canyon aquifer. The deepest string of 7. 3 -centimeter tubing was landed at 1, 247. 8 meters to monitor the Topopah Spring aquifer. Data collected during and shortly after hole construction include composite drill cuttings samples collected every 3. 0 meters, 67 percussion gun and rotary sidewall core samples, various geophysical logs, fluid samples (for groundwater chemistry analysis and tritium measurements), and water-level measurements. The well penetrated 1, 264. 3 meters of Tertiary volcanic rock, including three saturated welded-tuff aquifers and one saturated lava-flow aquifer. A water level was measured in the Timber Mountain aquifer at 449. 6 meters, during open-hole geophysical logging on September 20, 2009. The fluid level measured after the total depth was reached and the upper aquifer was cased off was 450. 0 meters when measured in the open borehole on October 17, 2009. Measurements on samples taken from the undeveloped well indicated that tritium levels averaging approximately 12, 430 picocuries per liter (less than Safe Drinking Water Act levels) were encountered within the Benham aquifer. Tritium was below the minimum detectable activity concentration for samples collected from the Tiva Canyon aquifer and the Topopah Spring aquifer...|$|E
