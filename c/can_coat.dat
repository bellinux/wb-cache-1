25|$|The {{most common}} {{water-based}} antifreeze solutions used in electronics cooling are mixtures {{of water and}} either ethylene glycol (EGW) or propylene glycol (PGW). The use of ethylene glycol has a longer history, especially in the automotive industry. However, EGW solutions formulated for the automotive industry often have silicate based rust inhibitors that <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> and/or clog heat exchanger surfaces. Ethylene glycol is listed as a toxic chemical requiring care in handling and disposal.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two classes}} of {{non-toxic}} anti-fouling coatings. The most common class relies on low friction and low surface energies. Low surface energies result in hydrophobic surfaces. These coatings create a smooth surface which can prevent attachment of larger microorganisms. For example, fluoropolymers and silicone coatings are commonly used. These coatings are ecologically inert but have problems with mechanical strength and long-term stability. Specifically, after days biofilms (slime) <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> the surfaces which buries the chemical activity and allows microorganisms to attach. The current standard for these coatings is polydimethylsiloxane, or PDMS, which consists of a non-polar backbone made of repeating units of silicon and oxygen atoms. The non-polarity of PDMS allows for biomolecules to readily adsorb to its surface in order to lower interfacial energy. However, PDMS also has a low modulus of elasticity that allows {{for the release of}} fouling organisms at speeds of greater than 20 knots. The dependence of effectiveness on vessel speed prevents use of PDMS on slow-moving ships or those that spend significant amounts of time in port.|$|E
2500|$|The {{braking surface}} is {{farther from the}} ground and {{possible}} contaminants like mud which <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> or freeze on the rim and pads. [...] With rim brakes, the first point that mud builds up on a mountain bike ridden in thick mud is usually the brakes. [...] A mountain bicycle with disc brakes is [...] less susceptible to mud buildup provided the rear frame and front fork yoke have sufficient clearance from the wheels.|$|E
25|$|A 2004 study {{reported}} that food packaged in <b>cans</b> <b>coated</b> with bisphenol A is correlated {{with the development of}} hyperthyroidism in cats.|$|R
50|$|Coors {{examined}} many <b>can</b> <b>coating</b> curing {{methods and}} decided to implement an ultraviolet system, which they started to do in 1975. Coors is the only manufacturer to use the UV curing method in the United States. In 1986, they made further innovations to their UV coating lines to increase flexibility and efficiency.|$|R
25|$|Pills <b>can</b> be <b>coated</b> with sugar, varnish, or wax to {{disguise}} the taste.|$|R
50|$|It {{is claimed}} {{to offer the}} {{benefits}} of high-cost materials at much lower costs, because such materials <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> lower-cost materials that have other necessary properties such as strength.|$|E
50|$|A normal {{silicon wafer}} {{coated with a}} layer of {{germanium}} (Ge) dipped in dilute hydrofluoric acid strips the naturally forming germanium oxide groups, creating hydrogen-terminated germanium. CVD <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> that with graphene.|$|E
50|$|Sodium {{hypophosphite}} {{is mainly}} used for {{electroless nickel plating}} (Ni-P). With this method, a durable nickel-phosphorus film <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> objects with irregular surfaces, and can widely be in avionics, aviation and the petroleum field.|$|E
50|$|The coating is a {{chemical}} {{conversion of the}} substrate metal into its oxide, and grows both inwards and outwards from the original metal surface. Because it grows inward into the substrate, it has excellent adhesion to the substrate metal. A wide range of substrate alloys <b>can</b> be <b>coated,</b> including all wrought aluminum alloys and most cast alloys, although high levels of silicon <b>can</b> reduce <b>coating</b> quality.|$|R
50|$|A {{business}} card <b>can</b> also be <b>coated</b> with a UV glossy coat (offset-uv printing). The coat is applied just like another ink using an additional unit on a sheetfed press. That being said, UV <b>coats</b> <b>can</b> also be applied as a spot coating - meaning areas <b>can</b> be <b>coated,</b> {{and other areas}} can be left uncoated. This creates additional design potential. UV Coating {{is not to be}} confused with coated stock, which has a gloss or semi gloss finish that is applied before printing.|$|R
50|$|Many fabrics <b>can</b> be <b>coated</b> or {{impregnated}} with silicone {{to form a}} strong, waterproof composite such as silnylon.|$|R
5000|$|The fungus {{itself does}} little {{harm to the}} plant; it merely blocks sunlight, and very rarely may stunt a plant's growth and yellow its foliage. Thus, sooty mold is {{essentially}} a cosmetic problem in the garden, as it is unsightly and <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> most of a plant {{in a matter of}} days or weeks.|$|E
50|$|Rainbow Raider's {{powers are}} derived entirely {{from the special}} goggles he wears, which allow him to project solid beams of rainbow-colored light he can either use offensively or as a slide for travel. In addition, he <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> people in certain colors of light to induce {{emotions}} (coating someone in blue light, for instance, would make them sad).|$|E
50|$|The {{process has}} {{advantages}} over other techniques for layer deposition (Plasma, Electron-Beam) {{in that it}} does not require the use of any vacuum, electron beam or plasma so reduces the manufacturing costs. It also uses less power and raw materials making it more environmentally friendly. Also the use of the electrostatic field means that the process <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> complex 3D parts easily.|$|E
25|$|Shoelaces <b>can</b> be <b>coated,</b> {{either in}} the factory or with {{aftermarket}} products, to increase friction and help them stay tied.|$|R

40|$|Companies are {{constantly}} {{expected to be}} more competitive while working in {{an environment in which}} time and cost are limited, thereby preventing such companies from taking the time required to be responsive. It is, therefore, important that companies understand that conventional knowledge and methods will not serve unless there is a concerted focus on improvement of organisational performance toward fulfilling increased expectations, not just maintaining that which is comfortable. A more sustainable approach may be the introduction of lean manufacturing techniques. The lean manufacturing process is one that continuously strives to eliminate waste, thereby increasing the percentage of time that may be devoted to value-adding activities. Lean manufacturing principles were applied in the <b>Can</b> <b>Coating</b> Plant of Duco Speciality Coatings. This study was intended to identify waste in the current production process in the <b>Can</b> <b>Coating</b> Plant and then to use lean tools and principles to eliminate such waste. Implementation of these lean tools proved to result in a leaner and more value-adding process. The new process rendered a positive result on Duco Coating’s costs, quality and product performance. Recommendations on further improvements were also offere...|$|R
50|$|Mostly organic {{films for}} {{photovoltaic}} applications are deposited by spin coating and vapor-phase deposition. However each method has certain draw backs, spin coating technique <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> larger surface areas with high speed but {{the use of}} solvent for one layer can degrade the already existing polymer layer. Another problem is related with the patterning of the substrate for device as spin-coating results in coating the entire substrate with a single material.|$|E

25|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} by its founder William Underwood (1787–1864) in 1822 in Boston, Massachusetts, as a condiment company using glass packing techniques. Among the condiments and other items glass packed were mustard, ketchup of various kinds, many types of pickled vegetables, and cranberries, primarily focusing on mustards and pickling. By 1836, Underwood shifted his packing from glass to steel <b>cans</b> <b>coated</b> with tin on the inside because glassmakers in the Boston area could {{not keep up with}} product demands from the canning company.|$|R
50|$|Solution {{polymers}} {{offer the}} absorbency of a granular polymer supplied in solution form. Solutions can be diluted with water prior to application, and <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> most substrates or used to saturate them. After drying {{at a specific}} temperature for a specific time, {{the result is a}} coated substrate with superabsorbency. For example, this chemistry can be applied directly onto wires and cables, though it is especially optimized for use on components such as rolled goods or sheeted substrates.|$|E
50|$|Coagulase {{reacts with}} {{prothrombin}} in the blood. The resulting complex is called staphylothrombin, which enables the enzyme protease to convert fibrinogen, a plasma protein {{produced by the}} liver, to fibrin. This results in clotting of the blood. Coagulase is tightly bound {{to the surface of}} the bacterium S. aureus and <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> its surface with fibrin upon contact with blood. The fibrin clot may protect the bacterium from phagocytosis and isolate it from other defenses of the host.The fibrin coat can therefore make the bacteria more virulent. Bound coagulase is part of the larger family of MSCRAMM.|$|E
50|$|As {{two-stroke}} engines {{use their}} crankcase to pressurize the air:fuel mixture before {{transfer to the}} cylinder, any standard lubricating oil left there (per practice with four-stroke engines) would be swept up and burnt with the fuel. To provide cylinder lubrication, fuels supplied to two-stroke engines are often mixed with oil so that it <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> the cylinders and bearing surfaces along its path. The ratio of gas to oil is set by the engine manufacturer but ranges from 30:1 to 50:1 per volume unit. Oil remaining in the mixture is burnt with the fuel and results in a familiar blue smoke and odor.|$|E
50|$|Through hot-isostatically {{pressing}} (HIP) a ZrW2O8-Cu composite (system) can be realized. Work done by C. Verdon and D.C. Dunand in 1997 used similarly sized zirconium tungstate {{and copper}} powder {{in a low}} carbon steel <b>can</b> <b>coated</b> with Cu, and they were HIPed under 103MPa pressure for 3 hours at 600 °C. A control experiment was also conducted, with only a heat treatment (i.e., no pressing) for the same powder mixture also under 600 °C for 3 hours in a quartz tube gettered with titanium.|$|R

50|$|In water, its free {{swimming}} infective larval cercariae can burrow {{into the}} skin of its definite host, the ruminant, upon contact. The cercariae enter the host's blood stream, and travel to the liver to mature into adult flukes. Adult flukes <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> themselves with host antigen thus avoiding detection by the host immune system. After {{a period of about}} three weeks the young flukes migrate to the mesenteric veins of the gut to copulate. The female fluke lays eggs, which migrate into the lumen of the gut and leave the host upon defecation. In fresh water, the eggs hatch, forming free swimming miracidia.|$|E
50|$|Like other New World warblers, the pink-headed warbler is an insectivore, {{gleaning}} {{insects and}} other invertebrates from vegetation (primarily in dense understory) and making aerial sallies after flying prey. It typically forages between 2 - 5 m off the ground, only seldom foraging above 7 m — except during the breeding season, when the male may hunt near {{the tops of}} trees from which it sings, as high as 15 m up. The species often joins mixed species flocks that pass through its territory. There {{is some evidence that}} volcanic eruptions, which <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> vegetation with thick ash and impact insect populations, cause declines in pink-headed warbler numbers.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the horn}} has finite volume but {{infinite}} surface area, {{it seems that}} it could be filled with a finite quantity of paint, and yet that paint would not be sufficient to coat its inner surface - an apparent paradox. In fact, in a theoretical mathematical sense, a finite amount of paint <b>can</b> <b>coat</b> an infinite area, provided the thickness of the coat becomes vanishingly small [...] "quickly enough" [...] to compensate for the ever-expanding area, which in this case is forced to happen to an inner-surface coat as the horn narrows. However, to coat the outer surface of the horn with a constant thickness of paint, no matter how thin, would require an infinite amount of paint.|$|E
5|$|Materials <b>can</b> be <b>coated</b> with a {{thin film}} of niobium(V) oxide {{chemical}} vapor deposition or atomic layer deposition processes, produced by the thermal decomposition of niobium(V) ethoxide above 350°C.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, the {{viral vector}} <b>can</b> be <b>coated</b> with a polymer such as {{polyethylene}} glycol, shielding it from antibodies, but this also prevents viral coat proteins adhering to host cells.|$|R
