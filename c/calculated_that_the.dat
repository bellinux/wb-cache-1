5|$|In December 1917 the Bolsheviks {{were under}} intense {{pressure}} from the Germans to conclude peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, and Russia Bolshevism was in crisis, with a demoralized army {{and the fate of}} the October Revolution in doubt. Lenin <b>calculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bolsheviks could hold central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud and his senate delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917.|$|E

5|$|As a result, the Americans {{entered the}} battle with a very good picture of where, when, and in what {{strength}} the Japanese would appear. Nimitz knew that the Japanese had negated their numerical advantage by dividing their ships into four separate task groups, all too-widely separated {{to be able to}} support each other. This dispersal resulted in few fast ships being available to escort the Carrier Striking Force, reducing the number of anti-aircraft guns protecting the carriers. Nimitz <b>calculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> aircraft on his three carriers, plus those on Midway Island, gave the U.S. rough parity with Yamamoto's four carriers, mainly because American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones. The Japanese, by contrast, remained mainly unaware of their opponent's true strength and dispositions even after the battle began.|$|E

5|$|At around midday on 23 November Horrocks darkened {{his room}} and focused the rays of {{sunlight}} coming through the window onto the paper where the image could be observed safely. At his location in Much Hoole (the latitude of which he determined to be 53° 35'), he <b>calculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> transit should begin at about 3:00pm on Sunday the 24th, but he began his observations the previous day fearing that he might miss the event if his calculations proved to be inaccurate.

5|$|Berzelius {{made some}} initial characterisations {{of the new}} metal and its {{chemical}} compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (its actual value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so <b>calculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 amu); it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic thorium was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} that Loring was {{proposed}} for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, property values plummeted, and people delayed buying homes, fearing that {{they would need to}} relocate. The reduction in the base of around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County would need to relocate, according to county officials. A $25,000 study, commissioned by the Department of Labor and conducted at Northeastern University, <b>calculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> region had lost over $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|Greg Paul (1988) {{proposed}} that the horns were butting weapons and that the small orbita would have minimized the possibility of hurting the eyes while fighting. Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues (1998) suggested that Carnotaurus used its horns in a way similar to rams. They <b>calculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> neck musculature {{was strong enough to}} absorb the force of two individuals colliding with their heads frontally at a speed of 5.7m/s each. Fernando Novas (2009) interpreted several skeletal features as adaptations for delivering blows with the head. He suggested that the shortness of the skull might have made head movements quicker by reducing the moment of inertia, while the muscular neck would have allowed strong head blows. He also noted an enhanced rigidity and strength of the spinal column that may have evolved to withstand shocks conducted by the head and neck.|$|E
5|$|In 1761, Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov {{observed}} an arc {{of light}} surrounding {{the part of}} Venus off the Sun's disc {{at the beginning of}} the egress phase of the transit and concluded that Venus has an atmosphere. In 1940, Rupert Wildt <b>calculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> amount of CO2 in the Venusian atmosphere would raise surface temperature above the boiling point for water. This was confirmed when Mariner 2 made radiometer measurements of the temperature in 1962. In 1967, Venera 4 confirmed that the atmosphere consisted primarily of carbon dioxide.|$|E

5|$|M-65 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state highways. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic using the roads under its jurisdiction. They use a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. In 2009, MDOT's surveys <b>calculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> highest volume of traffic along M-65 was 6,699cars north of the M-55 junction; the highest commercial AADT was 310trucks along the River Road National Scenic Byway segment north to the F-30 junction in Glennie. The lowest traffic counts were the 947cars and 107trucks near the northern terminus in Presque Isle County. The section of M-65 concurrent with M-32 has been listed {{as a part of}} the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} using {{a variety}} of mitochondrial and nuclear genes places the Noronha skink among the tropical African species of Trachylepis, a position also supported by morphological similarities. It may have arrived on its island on rafting vegetation from southwestern Africa via the Benguela Current and the South Equatorial Current, which passes Fernando de Noronha. This possibility was first suggested by Alfred Russel Wallace before 1888. Mausfeld and coworkers <b>calculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> journey from Africa to Fernando de Noronha would take 139 days. Because this period seemed too long for the skink to survive, they proposed that the Noronha skink instead arrived via Ascension Island, where a skink may have persisted into historical times.|$|E
5|$|Polling {{has shown}} a modest rise in support for NATO {{membership}} among Swedes since 2008 according to Ipsos polling, going from 22 percent in May 2008 to 33 percent in January 2015, with another from the SOM Institute in May 2015 showing similar numbers. According to Svenska Dagbladet, support in 2011 was at 23 percent, and has risen somewhat significantly to 41 percent in September 2015, when only 39 percent of respondents were opposed to NATO membership. An October 2014 survey commissioned by TV4 News also showed slightly more respondents supporting membership than opposing it. In 2014, news that a military expert in Sweden had <b>calculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country could hold out for a week if attacked temporarily lifted support for NATO membership in polls.

5|$|Rupert {{then finally}} made a {{successful}} crossing into the Caribbean, landing first at Saint Lucia, before continuing {{up the chain}} of the Antilles to the Virgin Islands. There the fleet {{was hit by a}} terrible hurricane, which scattered the ships and sank the Defiance, this time with Prince Maurice on board. It was a while before Maurice's death became certain, which came as a terrible blow to Rupert. He was forced to return to Europe, arriving in France in March 1653 with a fleet of five ships. It became clear, as the profits and losses of the piracy campaign were <b>calculated,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> venture had not been as profitable as hoped. This complicated tensions in the Royalist court, and Charles II and Rupert eventually split the spoils, after which Rupert, tired and a little bitter, returned to France to recuperate from the long campaign.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experienced}} {{pilots who}} were at the airport {{at the time of the}} accident testified that they considered the weather at that time unsuitable for flight, as a thunderstorm seemed to be forming or moving over the field. In addition, investigators determined that the weight of the aircraft during its takeoff roll exceeded its maximum allowable takeoff weight by 96lbs, which would have increased the stall speed by about two percent. Since the aircraft was flying in moderate to heavy rain, the NTSB <b>calculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> water flowing on the wings would have further increased the stall speed by about 1.5%. A higher stall speed reduces the margin of safety at slower airspeeds, such as during a climb.|$|E
