5|$|In this clause the adverbial, helehgüjgeer 'without saying ' must {{precede the}} predicate's complement, üünijg 'it-' {{in order to}} avoid {{syntactic}} ambiguity, since helehgüjgeer is itself derived from a verb and hence an üünijg preceding it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective such as hurdan 'fast', it could optionally immediately precede the predicate. There are also cases in which the adverb must immediately precede the predicate.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} {{unless and until}} the suspect {{actually}} stated that he was relying on that right, his subsequent voluntary statements {{could be used in}} court and police could continue to interact with (or question) him. The mere act of remaining silent was, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked his or her rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> implying a waiver.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days later}} Edwards likely killed Günter Steinhausen, {{a friend of}} Marseille. The next day, 7 September 1942, another close friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt was posted missing in action. These {{personal}} losses weighed heavily on Marseille's mind along with his family tragedy. It was noted he barely spoke and became more morose in the last weeks of his life. The strain of combat also induced consistent sleepwalking at night and other symptoms that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> posttraumatic stress disorder. Marseille never remembered these events.|$|E

50|$|On {{appeal the}} Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court {{set aside the}} {{judgment}} of the Sessions Court, and sentenced the accused to one and five years imprisonment respectively. The Court held that passive submission due to fear induced by serious threats <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> consent or willing sexual intercourse.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Sakura Sakura" [...] melody uses a pentatonic scale {{known as}} the Japanese mode. This <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> Phrygian Dominant Minor Mode in Western musical theory, using scale degrees 3, 4, 6, 7, 1, 3 (E, F, A, B, C, E or Me, Fa, La, Ti, Do, Me in solfège).|$|R
5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Attorney General Jack Conway {{was asked}} to issue advisory opinions on two gambling-related issues. Republican state senator Damon Thayer asked for an opinion as to whether Instant Racing – allowing individuals to bet {{on the outcome of}} previously run horse races – would be allowable under the state constitution. Democratic Representative Jody Richards also asked for an advisory opinion as to whether a constitutional amendment was required to allow video lottery terminals at the state's racetracks or whether they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> legal under the amendment that allowed a state lottery. Critics charged that Conway had a conflict of interest in the matter because his father {{was a member of the}} Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, but Conway denied that a conflict existed, and the state Executive Branch Ethics Board refused to take a position unless an official request for an investigation were made. Conway subsequently opined in June 2009 that video lottery terminals would be legal if governed by the Kentucky Lottery Corporation and in January 2010 that instant racing would be allowable under the state's parimutuel betting statutes with a few regulatory changes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method for}} finding hidden messages, however, lies in {{interpreting}} passages that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> ambiguous, since a favourite technique of the poet/dramatists {{of the time}} was irony, the double meaning or double entendre—i.e. playing with words.|$|E
25|$|Board member Buckingham {{had been}} a lively person before the trial. During trial he {{appeared}} feeble. Then after the trial he was vibrant again. If this assessment is accurate, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> deceit, but not perjury.|$|E
5000|$|Based on {{the above}} passage, a common {{translation}} into English, the white rider is generally {{referred to as}} [...] "Conquest". The name <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> [...] "Victory", as in the translation found in the Jerusalem Bible (the Greek words are derived from the verb , to conquer or vanquish). He carries a bow, and wears a victor's crown.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} 1700 that the Torii began to create {{full-size}} paintings and prints that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> interpreted as independent works of art. Of course, many still depicted actors and the kabuki world, and <b>could</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> serving as promotional materials. But by this time Kiyonobu, and his successor Torii Kiyonobu II, were also producing paintings and prints of courtesans, erotic scenes, and sumo.|$|R
50|$|Black Codes {{restricted}} black people's {{right to}} own property, conduct business, buy and lease land, and move freely through public spaces. A central element of the Black Codes were vagrancy laws. States criminalized men who were out of work, or who were not working at a job whites recognized. Failure to pay a certain tax, or to comply with other laws, <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> vagrancy.|$|R
25|$|The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) {{would later}} {{establish}} that a covert, informal network of former or still serving {{army and police}} operatives, frequently acting in conjunction with extreme right-wing elements, was involved in actions that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> fomenting violence and which resulted in gross human rights violations, including random and targeted killings.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal {{found that}} the two {{remaining}} statements were not contemptuous of the courts. One of the statements <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> claiming that the Government, acting through the Prosecution, had chosen to bring reduced charges against a German national for fear of economic reprisals by the German government. The other statement was possibly directed at the People's Action Party, the ruling party of Singapore.|$|E
25|$|In Denmark, it {{is legal}} to burn or desecrate the {{national}} flag, the Dannebrog. It is illegal to publicly burn or desecrate the flags of foreign countries, the United Nations and Council of Europe according to section 110(e) of the Danish penal code because Parliament has decided that burning or desecrating these {{is a matter of}} foreign relations, as it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> a threat. This law is rarely used; the last conviction was in 1936.|$|E
50|$|Attorney General Bruning and Governor Johanns {{initially}} {{moved to}} dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing, the case was not ripe, and the initiative measure <b>could</b> not possibly <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> a bill of attainder.|$|R
25|$|By 1857, Fitz Hugh Ludlow {{had become}} a known hashish addict and the bestselling author of The Hasheesh Eater. In 1859, he married Rosalie Osborne in her {{hometown}} of Waterville, New York. Her mother had reservations about Ludlow, who continuously struggled with finances. At one point, Rosalie was forced to write at least one job inquiry for him in a letter that <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> flirtatious.|$|R
50|$|Great Britain and France {{agreed to}} {{recognize}} the provisional independence of Syria and Mesopotamia, while claiming mandates for their administration. Palestine was composed of the Ottoman administrative districts of southern Syria. Under international law, premature recognition of its independence would be a gross affront {{to the government of}} the newly declared parent state. It <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> a belligerent act of intervention without any League of Nations sanction.|$|R
25|$|Also in 794, Emperor Constantine VI (r. 776–797) {{decided to}} {{separate}} from his first wife, Maria of Amnia, and to marry Maria's kubikularia (Lady-in-waiting), Theodote, a cousin of Theodore the Studite. Although the Patriarch may initially have resisted this development, as a divorce without proof of adultery {{on the part of}} the wife <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> illegal, he ultimately gave way. The marriage of Constantine and Theodote was celebrated in 795, although not by the patriarch, as was normal, but by a certain Joseph, a priest of Hagia Sophia.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to growing {{concerns for the}} economy, observers believed that many voters shied away from Islamism after several local elections resulted in victories for Islamic parties. Once elected, these officials began experimenting with sharia, or Islamic law, prompting resistance among the local population. Most notably, legislators had proposed an anti-pornography bill in 2006 to gain the favor of religious groups. However, the bill's vagueness meant that practicing yoga <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> a pornographic action. Additionally, several corruption charges were brought against officials representing Islamic parties, which had previously been considered clean compared to other political parties.|$|E
25|$|On April 30, Nixon {{asked for}} the {{resignation}} of Haldeman and Ehrlichman, two of his most influential aides. They were later both indicted, convicted, and ultimately sentenced to prison. He {{asked for the}} resignation of Attorney General Kleindienst, to ensure no one could claim that his innocent friendship with Haldeman and Ehrlichman <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> a conflict. He fired White House Counsel John Dean, {{who went on to}} testify before the Senate Watergate Committee and said that he believed and suspected the conversations in the Oval Office were being taped. This information became the bombshell that helped force Richard Nixon to resign rather than be impeached.|$|E

I {{had no reason to}} be bewildered by it, purely and simply, because it <b>could</b> certainly <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> a fairly shocking collection of bits and pieces to stick on a group of people and represent that in this country.|$|R
5000|$|While {{they were}} not fired, Lord Sugar criticised Gary for his poor sales and for having yet to lose his [...] "corporate" [...] image, while he criticised Joseph for his poor manners to the Canary Wharf {{developers}} and for hastily stepping up to be PM, stating that his performance <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> evidence {{that he may have}} entered the process a little too early in his career.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{overturned}} the Lovings' convictions in a unanimous decision dated June 12, 1967, dismissing the Commonwealth of Virginia's argument that a law forbidding both {{white and black}} persons from marrying persons of another race and providing identical penalties to white and black violators <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> racially discriminatory. The court ruled that Virginia's anti-miscegenation statute violated both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|R
25|$|For {{more than}} a decade since the Bringing Them Home report was {{submitted}} to Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, he and his coalition colleagues consistently rejected calls for a formal government apology, though some coalition government members stated that they were personally sorry for the outcomes of the policy. They were concerned that a formal apology <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> an admission of deliberate wrongdoing, rather than acknowledging that the originally stated intentions of the government were believed to be {{in the interests of the}} children and their futures. Howard and his supporters were concerned that such an apology would suggest that the government would be admitting liability in any duty-of-care legal proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturers {{of these}} items must take into {{consideration}} when creating these products whether the product <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> counterfeiting. Overlapping note images and/or changing {{the dimensions of the}} reproduction to be at least 50% smaller or 50% larger than the original is one way to avoid the risk of being considered a counterfeit. But in cases where realism is the goal, other steps may be necessary. For example, in the stack of bank notes seat mentioned earlier, the decal used to create the product would be considered counterfeit. However, once the decal has been affixed to the resin stack shell and cannot be peeled off, the final product is no longer at risk of being classified as counterfeit, even though the resulting appearance is realistic.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of {{inconsistencies}} of judgment, necromancers and other practitioners of the magic arts were able to utilize spells featuring holy names with impunity, as any biblical references in such rituals <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> prayers rather than spells. As a consequence, the necromancy that appears in the Munich Manual is an evolution of these theoretical understandings. It {{has been suggested that}} the authors of the Manual knowingly designed the book to be in discord with ecclesiastical law. The main recipe employed throughout the Manual used the same religious language and names of power alongside demonic names. An understanding of the names of God derived from apocryphal texts and the Hebrew Torah required that the author of such rites have at least a casual familiarity with these sources.|$|E
5000|$|Meynert {{developed}} {{theories in}} regards to correlations between neuroanatomical and mental processes. He conceptualized that a coupling between one mental association and its temporal successor as a literal contact between cortical nerve cells linked to one other by nerve fibers, {{and a series of}} cortical associations <b>could</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> being a [...] "train of thought". He also theorized that ideas and memories are to be envisioned as being attached to specific cortical cells.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Steffan (born July 29, 1964) is an American {{lawyer and}} gay activist. He was {{expelled}} from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis in 1987 shortly before graduation after disclosing his homosexuality. He sued the U.S. Department of Defense, claiming that his oral avowal of homosexuality <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> an indication that he ever had or intended to engage in sexual relations with another man. He lost a protracted court battle for reinstatement in 1994.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, Matt LeMay of Pitchfork Media {{described}} {{the song in}} this way: [...] "'Accidents Will Happen', {{one of the finest}} songs in his, or any, repertoire, matches a signature smirking double-entendre with an almost Baroque pop sensibility. Melodically and lyrically, the song is above reproach, as Costello sings of infidelity with what <b>could</b> either <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> regret or smug satisfaction. It's also one of several songs on Armed Forces to benefit from the album's dense production." ...|$|R
25|$|On February 1 as the {{quadripartite meeting}} was taking place, the NLD {{publicly}} announced that Thein Lwin, its central committee member {{and the chairman}} of National Network for Education Reform, did not represent the party or its policies. It further mentioned in the statement that the NLD could take legal action against Thein Lwin for violating party rules regarding asking permission to participate in organizations independent of the party. Han Tha Myint, a central committee member of the NLD, also stated that Aung San Suu Kyi, the chairman of the NLD, did not support Thein Lwin as his actions <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> representative of the party’s stance on the issue. The ACDE promptly responded to that statement the next day by accusing the NLD for attempting to undermine the student protests at such a critical moment.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the book}} Who Killed Karen Silkwood, the {{assassination}} scene in the movie The China Syndrome, in which the character Hector's car is run off the road, {{is based on a}} theorized version of Silkwood's death. In the film, the power plant's agents come up behind Hector's vehicle and ram him, repeatedly, from behind until a device on their front bumper engages his rear bumper and lets them lift the rear end of his vehicle off the road, thereby pushing his car over a cliff. Subsequently, police officers remove the evidence from his vehicle and hand it to the villains because their company's name is on the documents. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> an attempt by the film's producers to influence the jury in the Silkwood case. According {{to the book}}, it was for this reason that the jury was forbidden from seeing that then-new movie while they were hearing the case and deliberating.|$|E
25|$|Unihemispheric sleep {{refers to}} {{sleeping}} {{with only a}} single cerebral hemisphere. The phenomenon has been observed in birds and aquatic mammals, {{as well as in}} several reptilian species (the latter being disputed: many reptiles behave in a way which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> unihemispheric sleeping, but EEG studies have given contradictory results). Reasons for the development of unihemispheric sleep are likely that it enables the sleeping animal to receive stimuli—threats, for instance—from its environment, and that it enables the animal to fly or periodically surface to breathe when immersed in water. Only NREM sleep exists unihemispherically, and there seems to exist a continuum in unihemispheric sleep regarding the differences in the hemispheres: in animals exhibiting unihemispheric sleep, conditions range from one hemisphere being in deep sleep with the other hemisphere being awake to one hemisphere sleeping lightly with the other hemisphere being awake. If one hemisphere is selectively deprived of sleep in an animal exhibiting unihemispheric sleep (one hemisphere is allowed to sleep freely but the other is awoken whenever it falls asleep), the amount of deep sleep will selectively increase in the hemisphere that was deprived of sleep when both hemispheres are allowed to sleep freely.|$|E
25|$|A {{precursor}} to the dory type was the early French bateau type, a flat bottom boat with straight sides used as early as 1671 on the Saint Lawrence River. The common coastal boat of the time was the wherry and the merging of the wherry design with the simplified flat bottom of the bateau resulted in {{the birth of the}} dory. England, France, Italy, and Belgium have small boats from medieval periods that <b>could</b> reasonably <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> predecessors of the Dory.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that UVM {{received}} funds from the State of Vermont as a state university, the use of tax dollars for support of religious services <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>construed</b> <b>as</b> compelling the taxpayers to support a place of worship.
