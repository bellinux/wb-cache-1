5|$|After Michael VIII's death, the Byzantines {{suffered}} from constant <b>civil</b> <b>strife</b> early on. The Ottomans suffered civil conflict as well, but this occurred much {{later on in}} the 15th century, by that time the Byzantines were too weak to reconquer much territory. This is in contrast to the <b>civil</b> <b>strife</b> of Byzantium, occurring at a time (1341–71) when the Ottomans were crossing into Europe through a devastated Gallipoli and surrounding the city, thus sealing its fate as a vassal. When attempts were made to break this vassalage, the Byzantines found themselves out-matched and at the mercy of Latin assistance, which despite two Crusades, ultimately amounted to nothing.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a time}} of <b>civil</b> <b>strife</b> in Bahrain from 1994 to 1999, {{during which}} leftists, liberals and Islamists joined forces to demand {{democratic}} reforms. The uprising was the largest in the country's history, and included widespread demonstrations and violence.|$|E
5|$|Conflict {{among the}} Christian {{population}} of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis {{was within the}} Palaestina Prima province {{under the rule of}} the Byzantine Empire. The tension was a result of Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Juvenal, to his episcopal see. However, the conflict did not grow into <b>civil</b> <b>strife.</b>|$|E

During the <b>civil</b> <b>strifes</b> of 1820, Santa Fe troops were decisive in the defeat of Buenos Aires' centralist army.

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} examine three {{different}} aspects of political murder in the Greek classical world: a) justifiable killing of aspiring tyrants; b) “judicial” murder as an alternative kind of political killing, i. e. the habit of eliminating (directly or by death sentences) politicians who {{were considered to be}} dangerous; c) murders in <b>civil</b> <b>strifes.</b> Since murder seems to have been rather infrequent in Athens, where political confrontation was particularly fierce, one of the points that will be addressed in this paper is a consideration of the reasons for this ‘anomaly’...|$|R
5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that Offa had significant influence {{in the early years}} of his reign outside the traditional Mercian heartland. The overlordship of the southern English which had been exerted by Æthelbald appears to have collapsed during the <b>civil</b> <b>strife</b> over the succession, and it is not until 764, when evidence emerges of Offa's influence in Kent, that Mercian power can be seen expanding again.|$|E
5|$|Support {{for reform}} {{came from an}} {{unexpected}} source—a faction of the Tory Party—in 1829. The Tory government under Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, responding to the danger of <b>civil</b> <b>strife</b> in largely Roman Catholic Ireland, drew up the Catholic Relief Act 1829. This legislation repealed various laws that imposed political disabilities on Roman Catholics, in particular laws that prevented them from becoming members of Parliament. In response, disenchanted Tories who perceived {{a danger to the}} established religion came to favour parliamentary reform, in particular the enfranchisement of Manchester, Leeds, and other heavily Noncomformist cities in northern England.|$|E
5|$|The Late Middle Ages {{was marked}} by {{difficulties}} and calamities including famine, plague, and war, which significantly diminished the population of Europe; between 1347 and 1350, the Black Death killed {{about a third of}} Europeans. Controversy, heresy, and the Western Schism within the Catholic Church paralleled the interstate conflict, <b>civil</b> <b>strife,</b> and peasant revolts that occurred in the kingdoms. Cultural and technological developments transformed European society, concluding the Late Middle Ages and beginning the early modern period.|$|E
50|$|The Romans {{looked upon}} the Greek {{civilisation}} with great admiration. The Greeks saw Rome {{as a useful}} ally in their <b>civil</b> <b>strifes,</b> and it wasn't long before the Roman legions were invited to intervene in Greece. In less than 50 years the whole of mainland Greece was subdued. The Roman legions crushed the Macedonian phalanx twice, in 197 and 168 BC; in 146 BC the Roman consul Lucius Mummius razed Corinth, marking the end of free Greece. The same year Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, the son of Scipio Africanus, destroyed the city of Carthage, making it a Roman province.|$|R
50|$|With time {{he emerged}} as one of the most {{influential}} Mamluk commanders, sharing a de facto control of Egypt with his fellow Murad Bey. The two men became a duumvirate, Murad Bey managing military matters while Ibrahim Bey managed civil administration. They survived through the persistent Ottoman attempts at overthrowing the Mamluk regime and <b>civil</b> <b>strifes.</b> They served as kaymakams (acting governors) in Egypt on occasion, although they effectively held de facto power for decades, even over the appointed Ottoman governor of Egypt. From 1771 to 1773, Ibrahim Bey served as the amir al-hajj (commander of the hajj caravan) of Egypt.|$|R

Henry II faced rebellions from his own sons, the future monarchs Richard I and John. Nevertheless, Henry managed to expand his kingdom, forming what is retrospectively known as the Angevin Empire. Upon Henry's death, his elder son Richard succeeded to the throne; he was absent from England for most of his reign, as he left to fight in the Crusades. He was killed besieging a castle, and John succeeded him.|$|E

But he {{overestimated}} and over exercised his powers {{with the result that}} the Emperor’s family called their Hindu Maratha confederacy to help them get rid of their Vizier. A <b>civil</b> <b>strife</b> ensued and eventually in 1753 Safdarjung was driven out of Delhi. He died soon thereafter in 1754. After his death his son Nawab Shujaud Daula pleaded with the Mughal Emperor to permit him to erect a tomb for his father in Delhi. He then built the tomb, which was designed by an Abyssininan architect.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, <b>civil</b> <b>strife</b> {{broke out in}} Corinth between the {{democratic}} party and the oligarchic party. The democrats, supported by the Argives, launched an attack on their opponents, and the oligarchs were driven from the city. These exiles went to the Spartans, based at this time at Sicyon, for support, while the Athenians and Boeotians came up to support the democrats. In a night attack, the Spartans and exiles succeeded in seizing Lechaeum, Corinth's port on the Gulf of Corinth, and defeated the army that came out to challenge them the next day. The anti-Spartan allies then attempted to invest Lechaeum, but the Spartans launched an attack and drove them off.|$|E

5|$|From 1923 to 1958, {{conflicts}} erupted among Armenian {{political parties}} struggling to dominate and organize the diaspora. The ARF and Hunchakian parties struggled in 1926 {{for control of}} the newly established shanty-town of Bourj Hammoud in Lebanon; ARF member Vahan Vartabedian was assassinated. The assassination of Hunchakian members Mihran Aghazarian and S. Dekhrouhi followed in 1929 and 1931 respectively. In 1956, when Bishop Zareh was consecrated Catholicos of Cilicia, the Catholicos of Echmiadzin refused to recognize his authority. This controversy polarized the Armenian community of Lebanon.

Both the military defences and the internal accommodation of these castles were significantly improved.

The Tower of London was extended to form a concentric fortress with extensive living quarters, although Henry primarily used the castle as a secure retreat {{in the event of}} war or <b>civil</b> <b>strife.</b> Henry also kept a menagerie at the Tower, a tradition begun by his father, and his exotic specimens included an elephant, a leopard and a camel.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius's {{defeat of}} the Persians ended a war that {{had been going on}} {{intermittently}} for almost 400 years and led to instability in the Persian Empire. Kavadh II died only months after assuming the throne, plunging Persia into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. Ardashir III, Heraclius's ally Shahrbaraz, and Khosrau's daughters Purandokht and Azarmidokht all succeeded to the throne within months of each other. Only when Yazdgerd III, a grandson of Khosrau II, succeeded to the throne in 632 was there stability.

5|$|Hereditary {{senators}} and equites combined military service with civilian posts, a career path {{known as the}} cursus honorum, typically starting with a period of junior administrative posts in Rome, followed by 5–10 years {{in the military and}} a final period of senior positions in either the provinces or Rome. This tiny, tightly-knit ruling oligarchy of under 10,000 men monopolised political, military and economic power in an empire of c. 80 million inhabitants and achieved a remarkable degree of political stability. During the first 200 years of its existence (30 BC – 180 AD), the empire suffered only one major episode of <b>civil</b> <b>strife</b> (the Civil War of 68–9). Otherwise, usurpation attempts by provincial governors were few and swiftly suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman {{advances}} {{into the}} Balkans were aided by further Byzantine civil conflict — this time between John V Palaeologus and {{his eldest son}} Andronicus IV. With Ottoman aid from Murad I, John V was able to blind Andronikus IV and his son John VII Palaeologus in September 1373. Andronicus escaped with his son and secured Murad's aid by promising a higher tribute than John V's. The <b>civil</b> <b>strife</b> continued as late as September 1390 though potential for conflict continued until 1408. John V eventually forgave Andronicus IV and his son in 1381, angering his second son and heir apparent, Manuel II Palaeologus.

Throughout the 1840s until the 1860s, the Ottomans launched their own modernization reforms, known as the Tanzimat, throughout the empire with varying degrees of success. Coinciding with these efforts, the international powers began a tug-of-war of influence in Palestine as they sought to extend their protection over the country's religious minorities, a struggle carried out mainly through their consular representatives in Jerusalem.|$|E

40|$|Istanbul, having hosted many civilizations and cultures, has a {{long and}} {{important}} past. Due to its geopolitical locations, {{the city has been}} the capital of two civilizations—Ottoman and Byzantine Empires—which left its traces {{in the history of the}} world. Architectural and symbolic monuments built by these civilizations made an impression in all communities making the city a center of attraction. After each and every damage caused by wars, <b>civil</b> <b>strifes,</b> and natural disasters, maximum effort has been made to restore these symbolic buildings. Attitude of a society to a piece of art or an architectural construction defined as historical artifact is shown in interventions, architectural supplementations and restorations to buildings to keep them alive. As a result of this attitude, it is accepted that buildings are perceived as a place of memory and symbolized with the city. The most important symbolic monument of the city, Ayasofya (Hagia Sophia), was found as the Church of the Byzantine Emperor in the year 360, then converted into the Mosque of the Ottoman Sultan, and now serves as one of the best-known museums of Turkey. With architectural additions requested by Byzantine emperors and Ottoman sultans, restorations and other functional changes; Hagia Sophia had become a monument witnessing its own changes as well as its surroundings while collecting memories. Accordingly, Hagia Sophia can be described as an immortal building.   Immortality is out of time notion, however it is a reflection of time effects as well. Immortality is about resisting to time. A construction from the past which appreciates as time passes will also exist in the future preserving its value. The building has been strengthened with the memory phenomenon formed during construction, incidents that the building witnessed in its location, restorations, architectural supplementations and the perception of the world heritage. The main purpose of this presentation is to show how an intangible concept as memory concretizes in an architectural structure within the frames of immortality and time concepts by examining Hagia Sophia...|$|R
5|$|The 1834 revolt and the {{immediate}} aftermath reduced the male population of Palestine by about one-fifth. This decrease is attributed to {{the large numbers of}} peasants who were either deported to Egypt to work in manufacturing, drafted into Egypt's military, or abandoned their villages and farms to join the Bedouin nomadic populations. Around 10,000 peasants were deported to Egypt and the general population was disarmed. The conscription orders were extended beyond the Muslim population to the local Christians. Taxes were also extended from landed property to include livestock as well. As Ibrahim consolidated his hold over Palestine and disarmed the population, banditry by local tribesmen and <b>civil</b> <b>strife</b> was largely eliminated.|$|E
5|$|The Second Arab {{siege of}} Constantinople in 717–718 was a {{combined}} {{land and sea}} offensive by the Muslim Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate against {{the capital city of}} the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople. The campaign marked the culmination of twenty years of attacks and progressive Arab occupation of the Byzantine borderlands, while Byzantine strength was sapped by prolonged internal turmoil. In 716, after years of preparations, the Arabs, led by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, invaded Byzantine Asia Minor. The Arabs initially hoped to exploit Byzantine <b>civil</b> <b>strife</b> and made common cause with the general Leo III the Isaurian, who had risen up against Emperor Theodosius III.

5|$|<b>Civil</b> <b>strife</b> {{and foreign}} invasions, {{such as the}} Mongol invasions in 1240/1241, 1259/1260 and 1287/1288, {{weakened}} and depopulated many of the small Polish principalities, as the country was becoming progressively more subdivided. Depopulation and increasing demand for labor caused a massive immigration of West European peasants into Poland, mostly German settlers; the early waves from Germany and Flanders occurred in the 1220s. The German, Polish and other new rural settlements represented a form of feudal tenancy with legal immunity and German town laws were often utilized as its legal bases. German immigrants were also important {{in the rise of}} the cities and the establishment of the Polish burgher (city dwelling merchants) class; they brought with them West European laws (Magdeburg rights) and customs that the Poles adopted. From that time, the Germans, who created early strong establishments (led by patriciates) especially in the urban centers of Silesia and other regions of western Poland, were an increasingly influential minority in Poland.|$|E

Women turned vague promises from the state into practical workings for protection and political development encouraged poor white women to affect change and take justice into their own hands as they fought with mill owners for yarn and food. Food riots and politics left women with direct action as mobs of disenfranchised women armed with revolvers, knives, and hatchets perpetrated 12 violent attacks on stores, government warehouses, army convoys, railroad depots, saltworks, and granaries just during March and April 1863.
