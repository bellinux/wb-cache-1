25|$|Damages may be {{general or}} consequential. General damages are those damages which {{naturally}} flow from {{a breach of}} contract. <b>Consequential</b> <b>damages</b> are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties {{at the time of}} contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. <b>Consequential</b> <b>damages</b> would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.|$|E

50|$|<b>Consequential</b> <b>damages,</b> {{otherwise}} known as special damages, are damages that can be proven to have occurred because {{of the failure of}} one party to meet a contractual obligation. They go beyond the contract itself and into the actions garnished from the failure to fulfill. The type of claim giving rise to the damages can affect the rules or calculations associated with a given type of damages, including <b>consequential</b> <b>damages</b> (e.g., breach of contract versus a tort claim). For example, <b>consequential</b> <b>damages</b> are a potential type of expectation damages which arise in contract law.|$|E

50|$|A typical {{example in}} the law of {{contracts}} is Hadley v Baxendale (1854), a case that is still routinely tested on bar examinations today. Treatises designed for practicing lawyers as well as textbooks for students earning non-legal degrees (i.e., business law courses for business administration students) concisely state the famous rules announced in that case that (1) <b>consequential</b> <b>damages</b> are limited to those foreseen by the parties {{at the time of}} contracting, thus implying that (2) a party must notify the other up front of its specific needs in order to expand what is mutually foreseeable and thereby recover <b>consequential</b> <b>damages</b> if the other breaches. Thus stated, Hadley seems simple enough, but a casebook for a law school course will never say that. Rather, the law student must deduce those principles from the somewhat archaic text of the Court of Exchequer's mid-19th-century decision.|$|E

In various cases Cascade Yachts have been dropped off slings, fallen off a trailer at highway speed, and submerged in a mudslide, and suffered little <b>consequential</b> <b>damage.</b> Many Cascade hulls were sold in various stages of completion for owners to finish the interiors.|$|R
