In the Fujii case, involving nearly 200 papers, the journal Anesthesia & Analgesia, which published 24 of Fujii's papers, has accepted that its handling of the issue was inadequate. [...] Following publication of a Letter to the Editor from Kranke and colleagues in April 2000, along with a non-specific response from Dr. Fujii, there was no follow-up on the allegation of data manipulation and no request for an institutional review of Dr. Fujii's research. Anesthesia & Analgesia went on to publish 11 additional manuscripts by Dr. Fujii following the 2000 allegations of research fraud, with Editor Steven Shafer stating in March 2012 that subsequent submissions to the Journal by Dr. Fujii should not have been published without first vetting the allegations of fraud. In April 2012 Shafer led a group of editors to write a joint statement, {{in the form of an}} ultimatum made available to the public, to a large number of academic institutions where Fujii had been employed, offering these institutions the chance to attest to the integrity of the bulk of the allegedly fraudulent papers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceRedundancy {{resolution}} of redundantly actuated cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) requires the computation of feasible and continuous cable tension distributions along a trajectory. This paper focuses on n-DOF CDPRs driven by n + 2 cables, since, for n = 6, these redundantly actuated CDPRs are relevant in many applications. The set of feasible cable tensions of n-DOF (n + 2) -cable CDPRs is a 2 -D convex polygon. An algorithm that determines the vertices of this polygon in a clockwise or counterclockwise order is first introduced. This algorithm is efficient and <b>can</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> infeasibility. <b>It</b> is then {{pointed out that}} straightforward modifications of this algorithm allow the determination of various (optimal) cable tension distributions. A self-contained and versatile tension distribution algorithm is thereby obtained. Moreover, the worst-case maximum number of iterations of this algorithm is established. Based on this result, its computational cost is analyzed in detail, showing that the algorithm is efficient and real-time compatible even in the worst case. Finally, experiments on two six-degree-of-freedom eight-cable CDPR prototypes are reported...|$|R

40|$|Image-based 6 -DoF pose {{estimation}} of arbitrarily shaped 3 D objects {{based on their}} shape is a rarely studied problem. Most existing image-based methods for pose estimation either exploit textural information in form of local features or, if shape-based, rely on the extraction of straight line segments or other primitives. Straight-forward extensions of 2 D approaches are potentially more general, but in practice assume a limited range of possible view angles. The general problem is that a 3 D object can potentially produce completely different 2 D projections depending on its relative pose to the observing camera. One {{way to reduce the}} solution space is to exploit temporal information, i. e. perform tracking. Again, existing model-based tracking approaches rely on relatively simple object geometries. In this paper, we propose a particle filter based tracking approach that <b>can</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> arbitrary shapes and arbitrary or even no texture, i. e. it offers a general solution to the rigid object tracking problem.
