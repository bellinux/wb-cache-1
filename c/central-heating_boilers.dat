5000|$|Condensing boilers are now largely {{replacing}} earlier, conventional {{designs in}} powering domestic central heating systems in Europe and, {{to a lesser}} degree, in North America. The Netherlands was the first country to adopt them broadly. In Europe, their installation is strongly advocated by pressure groups and government bodies concerned with reducing energy use. In the United Kingdom, for example, all new gas <b>central-heating</b> <b>boilers</b> fitted in England and Wales since 2005 must be high-efficiency condensing boilers unless there are exceptional circumstances the same regulations apply to oil-fired boilers from April 2007 (warm air central heating systems are exempt from these regulations). In the United States, there is a Federal tax credit for the installation of condensing boilers and additional rebates from power companies in some states. In Western Canada, energy suppliers now offer energy rebates when these systems are installed in multi-unit dwellings. The decrease in natural gas prices in North America has resulted in increased retrofitting of existing boiler installations with condensing equipment.|$|E
40|$|This paper summarises the {{state-of-the-art}} {{in housing}} management and maintenance practise of Dutch housing associations {{based on a}} survey conducted among almost all housing associations. We address the question what the current developments are in housing management and maintenance practice in the Netherlands. In a housing stock policy document a housing association constructs {{a picture of the}} composition of the desirable dwelling portfolio and sets up market and complex strategies. 71 % of the housing associations have formulated a housing stock policy document and 57 % of all respondents have formulated management schemes on the level of housing complexes. The housing associations consider housing quality and market perspective as most important in determining their housing stock policy. 60 % of the housing associations apply more than one quality level managing their housing stock. 71 % of the housing perform condition assessments to draw up the maintenance planning. Just a third one of the housing associations use condition marks to record the technical state of building components. Over 60 % of the housing associations use maintenance contracts for responsive maintenance and planned maintenance, especially for the maintenance of <b>central-heating</b> <b>boilers</b> and lifts. 36 % of the respondents have concluded performance-based maintenance contracts for paintwork.

50|$|Loscoe was {{the site}} of a {{landfill}} gas migration explosion on 24 March 1986. Although there were no fatalities, one house was completely destroyed by the blast and its three occupants injured. The atmospheric pressure {{on the night of the}} explosion fell 29 hPa (29 mbar) over a seven-hour period, causing the gas to be released from the ground in much greater quantities than usual. In the four hours before the explosion, which occurred at approximately 6.30 am, the local meteorological office had recorded average falls of 4 hPa (4 mbar) per hour. Several cubic metres of landfill gas (consisting of a 3:2 mixture of methane and carbon dioxide) collected under the ground near the house at 51 Clarke Avenue, and as the gas expanded it flowed into the space beneath the floor, from where it was drawn by convection to the gas <b>central-heating</b> <b>boiler</b> and ignited.|$|R
40|$|In a {{conventional}} domestic <b>central-heating</b> system, the <b>boiler</b> operates at an efficiency well below its full-load bench value {{due to its}} frequent on/off cycling. However the system's efficiency can be enhanced by incorporating a heat store between the boiler and the [`]radiators', so that this frequency of cycling is reduced significantly. By means of two computer programs simulating the behaviour of each system, this efficiency enhancement has been evaluated, together with its sensitivities to variations {{of a series of}} key design parameters. Associated laboratory work has been undertaken to determine experimentally the preferred configuration for a pair of heat exchangers placed inside such a water-filled heat store: these exchangers can be used to provide domestic hot-water by heating mains cold-water passed through them. A storage system of the proposed type offers cost advantages over conventional systems for installations in new properties, and may be cost effective even for some retrofit systems. ...|$|R
