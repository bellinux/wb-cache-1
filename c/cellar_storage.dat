5000|$|Natural {{refrigerated}} overwinter storage {{has been}} used in root cellars and snow caches. Using natural refrigeration in root <b>cellar</b> <b>storage,</b> Jorgensen and Stanek (1962) kept 3+0 and 2+2 white spruce in dormant condition for 6 months without apparent detriment to performance after outplanting. Moreover, the stock was highly resistant to spring frost damage. Natural cold storage for overwintering 3+0 and 2+2 white spruce was also used by Mullin (1966). Unlike Jorgensen and Stanek's (1962) stock, which was raised 550 km to the south of where it was planted, Mullin's stock was raised in a nursery at about the same latitude as the planting site; the stock experienced inside-bale temperatures down to -15 °C in mid-winter, but still showed first- and second-year survival rates of 85.9% and 65.9%, respectively, compared with 91.4% and 76.2%, respectively, for fresh-lifted stock. However, Mullin's stored stock was much more damaged by spring frost than was fresh-lifted stock and it [...] "showed a reduction in vigour as measured in terms of survival, susceptibility to damage and growth".|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} brewery {{was established}} on 1 June 1879 by Herman Meijling and J.H. Bartelink as the Hengelosche Stoom Beiersch Bierbrouwerij, translated as the Hengelo Steam Bavarian Beer Brewery. Beiersch Bier {{refers to the}} German state of Bavaria, home of an innovative method of brewing that soon became the standard in brewing lager beers. Like other Dutch brewers in the 19th century, Meijling and Bartelink adapted the Bavarian brewing process of lager beer, using bottom fermentation and <b>cellar</b> <b>storages</b> to mature the beer for several weeks. This approach resulted in typical clear lager, increased preservation and a smooth taste. The early adapters of this technology were able to increase their territory and market share, {{taking advantage of the}} extended sell by date.|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{bottling}} entails exposure of wine to variable amounts of oxygen. Depending on oxygen levels, this {{can contribute to}} wine evolution during bottle storage, including occurrence of oxidative off-flavours. Due to the large compositional differences existing among wines, the type and extent of the chemical transformations due to oxygen exposure are wine dependent. Analytical approaches typically involving GC-MS and/or LC-MS allow detailed characterisation of these changes. However, at a winery level, rapid assessment of the oxidative changes due to oxygen exposure at bottling remains challenging. In this study, the use of modified carbon paste electrodes for the voltammetric assessment of early post-bottling oxidation has been investigated. Ten commercial white wines from different grape varieties were bottled under controlled conditions to obtain two different degrees of oxygen exposure, ideally corresponding to good (NoOx) vs. average (Ox) bottling conditions. Free SO 2, total SO 2 and ascorbic acid at bottling were {{in the range of}} 37 - 42 mg/L, 97 - 123 mg/L, and 37 - 44 mg/L respectively. Either a lower or a higher oxygen ingress closures were used for NoOx and Ox wines respectively. After two months of <b>cellar</b> <b>storage,</b> samples analysed by linear sweep voltammetry using modified disposable carbon paste screen printed electrodes. Analyses were carried out in the 0 - 1200 mV range, with the obtained voltammograms providing a global profile of the pool of major white wine oxidizable substrates such as ortho-diphenols, phenolic acids, ascorbic acid and SO 2. NoOx wines showed relatively similar voltammetric profiles, although with different anodic current values, indicating differences in the concentrations of oxidizable substrates. Compared to NoOx samples, Ox wines generally exhibited a decrease in anodic current, with patterns that were wine depended. Oxidation fingerprints were obtained as difference of NoOx minus Ox voltammograms, revealing the existence of 4 different fingerprints across the 10 wines studied. Comparison of these oxidation fingerprints with those of a white wine spiked with pure compounds was attempted to assess the contribution of major wine compounds to the 4 fingerprints observed. Voltammetric data were also cross-compared with those obtained on the same wines using an untargeted LC-ESI-QTOF MS method, in a further attempt to evaluate the suitability of a rapid voltammetric approach to the evaluation of wine post-bottling oxidation...|$|E
