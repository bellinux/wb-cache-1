5|$|As {{hostilities}} renewed, San Martín organized several guerrilla {{groups in}} the countryside, and laid siege to Lima, but did not force his entry, as {{he did not want}} to appear as a conqueror to the local population. However, De la Serna suddenly left the city with his army, for unknown reasons. San Martín <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> open cabildo to discuss the independence of the country, which was agreed.

5|$|Aviation was not neglected.

Royal Air Force airfields were established at RAF Tengah and RAF Sembawang. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Lord Trenchard, argued that 30 torpedo bombers could replace the 15-inch guns. The First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Beatty, did not agree. A compromise was reached whereby the guns would be installed, {{but the issue}} was reconsidered when better torpedo planes became available. Test firings of 15-inch and 9.2-inch guns at Malta and Portsmouth in 1926 indicated that greatly improved shells were required if the guns were {{to have a chance}} of hitting a battleship.|$|E

The specifications <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> airliner capable of carrying 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound diesel engine.

5|$|Bush was {{appointed}} to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), and later director of OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-known policymaker and public intellectual during World War II, when he was in effect the first presidential science advisor. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received top priority from the highest levels of government. In Science, The Endless Frontier, his 1945 report to the President of the United States, Bush <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> expansion of government support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation.|$|E
5|$|By 1992, York Region {{was moving}} forward with plans to expand Green Lane into a four lane road, while the {{province}} was urged to consider extending Highway404 north to it, and eventually around {{the east side of}} Lake Simcoe. The province studied this and other options over the following years, before a formal announcement was made by Minister of Transportation Tony Clement on 22 June 1998 along with York Region chairman Bill Fisch. The plan <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> extension of Highway404 north to Green Lane, and expansion of Highway9 (now part of York Region Road 31), the western extension of Davis Drive outside town, to five lanes between Highway400 and Bathurst Street. At the time over 20,000 vehicles used Davis Drive on an average day.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden {{ordered the}} {{refurbishing}} {{of the state}} penitentiary, which had been damaged by a fire, and <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> extensive state geological survey. He also advised {{the creation of a}} sinking fund to retire the state's debt. The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on the drafting of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts and threaten Whig dominance in the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E

After Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley seemed reluctant to initiate an investigation, his opponent Davis questioned whether there was a police and city coverup. Eventually, after pressure by citizens' organizations and anti-brutality organizations, the police department resumed an internal investigation.|$|E
