40|$|In 1961 Kenya {{embarked}} on a program of agricultural reform called the Million Acre Settlement Scheme providing for the transfer of ownership {{of land in the}} Rift Valley from outgoing white settlers to local farmers. These new settlers were given loans by the Kenya Government {{to cover the cost of}} the purchase of their plots and of certain development inputs. Over course of time most of these farmers have fallen heavily into arrears with <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> their loans and this problem provides the focus for this study of problems of farmers on the settlement schemes, which has the ultimate objective of making recommendations for improving the present poor rate <b>of</b> <b>repayment.</b> Not unexpectedly overall income was found to be the crucial factor affecting rates <b>of</b> <b>repayment,</b> however the relationship of size of income to rate <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> is not straightforward as other factors intervene, especially patterns of expenditure, and more importantly perhaps to any solution are those which indirectly affect rates <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> through their influence on income levels. It was furthermore discovered that some loan instalments are never credited due to poor administration and that the quality of administration permeates many other variables.

In practice this cannot happen - some of GDP must go to survival - and historically debt repayment rates during periods <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> have been about 4%-10% of GDP (as in the United States during the Great Depression and World War II), so practical time to repay debt is rather Debt/GDP times 10-25.|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} an {{analysis}} of two criter of choice of investment variants: the criterion of limited time <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> and the criterion of capital invested.

In addition the author indicated that the attempts, met with in literature, at applying simultaneously, permanent and changing bases in calculating individual repayment times, is merely illusory. Further on in the article the author proves that the generally accepted hypothesis on the equiponderance of the criterion of limited time <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> and the criterion of capital invested is not true, and at the same time indicates in which particular cases this equiponderance can take place.

An econometric model of the short run dynamics of deposit and loan dollarization is estimated for the last decade.

We estimate the overall (and sectoral) <b>currency</b> mismatches <b>of</b> the Russian economy. The results show a gradual improvement of the net foreign <b>currency</b> position <b>of</b> the public sector, where we have seen significant accumulation of international reserves by the Bank <b>of</b> Russia and <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> government debt.
