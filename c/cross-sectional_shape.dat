Analysis of the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shape</b> of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk. A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy M33 could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.|$|E

The hair stiffness indexes of Mongoloids, Africans and Europeans are: 4.23, 2.75 and 1.59, respectively. This means that Mongoloids {{with the highest}} hair stiffness index value of 4.23 have the most rigid hair and Europeans with the lowest hair stiffness index value of 1.59 have the least rigid hair. The eccentricity of hair <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shape</b> index is also calculated using the thickest and thinnest axial diameters of human hair, and this index also differs by race. The hair eccentricity indexes of Africans, Europeans and Mongoloids are: 1.74, 1.49 and 1.30, respectively. This means that Africans with the highest hair eccentricity index value of 1.74 have the curliest hair and Mongoloids with the lowest hair eccentricity index value of 1.30 have the least curly hair.|$|E
25|$|A {{parabolic}} antenna is an antenna {{that uses a}} parabolic reflector, a curved surface with the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shape</b> of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. The main advantage of a {{parabolic antenna}} {{is that it has}} high directivity. It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a narrow beam, or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. Parabolic antennas have some of the highest gains, meaning that they can produce the narrowest beamwidths, of any antenna type. In order to achieve narrow beamwidths, the parabolic reflector must be much larger than the wavelength of the radio waves used, so parabolic antennas are used in the high frequency part of the radio spectrum, at UHF and microwave (SHF) frequencies, at which the wavelengths are small enough that conveniently-sized reflectors can be used.|$|E
500|$|The sail of Dimetrodon {{is formed}} by {{elongated}} neural spines projecting from the vertebrae. Each spine varies in <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shape</b> from its base to its tip {{in what is}} known as [...] "dimetrodont" [...] differentiation. Near the vertebra body, the spine cross section is laterally compressed into a rectangular shape, and closer to the tip, it takes on a figure-eight shape as a groove runs along either side of the spine. The figure-eight shape is thought to reinforce the spine, preventing bending and fractures. A cross section of the spine of one specimen of Dimetrodon giganhomogenes is rectangular in shape but preserves figure-eight shaped rings close to its center, indicating that the shape of spines may change as individuals age. The microscopic anatomy of each spine varies from base to tip, indicating where it was embedded in the muscles of the back and where it was exposed as part of a sail. The lower or proximal portion of the spine has a rough surface that would have served as an anchoring point for the epaxial muscles of the back, and also has a network of connective tissues called Sharpey's fibers that indicate it was embedded within the body. Higher up on the distal (outer) portion of the spine, the bone surface is smoother. The periosteum, a layer of tissue surrounding the bone, is covered in small grooves that presumably supported the blood vessels that vascularized the sail.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this study, a {{model was}} set up for {{simulating}} the effects of varying fiber <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shapes</b> on ultraviolet protection of fibers. The fiber diameter and fiber type were also involved in the model setting. Experiments of diffuse reflectance spectra measurement on natural (wool, cotton, silk), regenerated (bamboo viscose) and synthetic (polyester, nylon) fibers were conducted to verify the model predicted results. When a more complex shape was assumed as the fiber cross-section for model calculation, the predicted results have a better agreement with the actual results. The effects on ultraviolet absorption from fibers with different <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shapes</b> were investigated at a single fiber, fiber bundle and yarn levels. With the same material, when the fiber cross-sectional area and the areal coverage of a single fiber were constant, the triangular shape had the lowest ultraviolet transmittance and the highest ultraviolet reflectance for a single fiber and also for a fiber bundle. The difference of fiber <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shapes</b> was also significant in the ultraviolet protection of a single yarn. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The double {{corrugated}} waveguide, {{with square}} cross-sectional corrugations, was demonstrated {{as an effective}} slow-wave structure for terahertz vacuum electron devices. The moderate losses and the good interaction impedance, in both the forward- and backward-wave regimes, enable the design of tubes at terahertz frequencies. However, significant performance improvements would derive from a further reduction of losses and an increase of the interaction impedance. Different new <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shapes</b> of the corrugations in the double corrugated waveguide are proposed to reduce the losses and improve the interaction impedance. A relevant improvement of the tube performance in both the forward- and backward-wave regimes is obtained by using the proposed new improved <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shapes...</b>|$|R

Solving directly such equations for various boundary conditions, which take into account the effects of torsion-related warping as well as transverse shear deformations, can yield the solutions to the problem. The solutions can be used to calculate various internal forces, stresses, strains and displacements of the beams. The present theory will be used to investigate the stresses and displacements of a cantilevered curved beam subjected to action of arbitrary load. The numerical results are very close to the FEM results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Column {{jacketing}} with FRP sheets {{plays an}} important role in enhancing the performance of RC column. FRP is an Advanced Composite Material (ACM) that is relatively new material to civil engineering. It holds a better choice than reinforcing steel in certain applications. In order to attain large deformation before failure occurs and to enhance an adequate load resistance capacity, RC columns has to be laterally jacketed. Jacketing RC column with FRP improves column performance not only by carrying some fraction of axial load applied to it but also by providing lateral confining pressure to the column externally. In this work a comparative study on GFRP jacketed RC columns and CFRP jacketed RC columns of different <b>shapes</b> having same <b>cross-sectional</b> area were analysed. Buckling analysis on RC columns of circular, rectangular and square <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shapes</b> has been done in ANSYS 15. FRP Jacketing increases the load carrying capacity of all RC columns. CFRP Jacketed RC columns shows a better load carrying capacity than GFRP Jacketed RC Columns when both axial and eccentric loadings were applied in circular, rectangular and square <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>shapes...</b>|$|R
