30|$|<b>Coverage</b> <b>based</b> fuzzing {{has proved}} {{a great success}} in finding userland {{application}} bugs. And people begin to apply the <b>coverage</b> <b>based</b> fuzzing method in finding kernel vulnerabilities. Representative work include syzkaller (Vyukov 2015), TriforceAFL (Hertz 2015) and kAFL (Schumilo et al. 2017). Syzkaller instrument the kernel via compilation and run the kernel over a set of QEMU virtual machines. Both coverage and security violations are tracked during fuzzing. TriforceAFL is {{a modified version of}} AFL that supports kernel fuzzing with QEMU full-system emulation. KAFL utilized the new hardware feature, Intel PT, to track the coverage and only track kernel code. The experiment shows that KAFL is about 40 times faster than Triforce and greatly improve the efficiency.|$|R

In the context of recent applications of content {{distribution in}} smart device networks such as mobile offloading and enterprise network defense prioritization, we propose a temporal <b>coverage</b> <b>based</b> scheme that exploits nodes' encounter regularity and content's delivery delay tolerance to reduce content delivery costs. Using kernel-density estimation (KDE) on the readily available proximity encounter records, we propose a network structural property, T-covering set, and a corresponding localized algorithm that distributedly elects a T-covering set from the underlying network. Using real Bluetooth encounter traces, we demonstrate that temporal <b>coverage</b> <b>based</b> content distribution using T-covering set can significantly reduce content delivery cost with minimal delay and no sacrifice in coverage...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} felt that {{software}} quality, {{in the form}} of reliability or "trustworthiness," can be demonstrated by the successful completion of testing that "covers" the software. However, this intuition has little experimental or theoretical support. This paper considers why the intuition is so powerful and yet misleading. Formal definitions of software "dependability" are suggested, along with new approaches for measuring this analog of trustworthiness. 1. The idea of test coverage From the beginning of computer programming, clever people have looked for clever ways to catch the mistakes that too easily enter even the best programs. The essential ideas are ones of systematic coverage, judging the quality of a test by how well it explores the nooks and crannies of program or specification. The ideas of functional <b>coverage,</b> <b>based</b> on the specification, and control <b>coverage,</b> <b>based</b> on the program's control structure, are the most popular. They have been repeatedly reinvented and captur [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Access Control {{is among}} the most {{important}} security mechanisms to put in place in order to secure applications, and XACML is the de facto standard for defining access control policies. Due to the complexity of XACML language it is important to perform efficient testing to identify potential security flaws and bugs. However, in practice, exhaustive testing is impossible due to budget constraints. Test cases selection and prioritization are two well-known solutions to maximize the effectiveness of the test suite in terms of discovered faults, reducing as much as possible the required effort for tests execution and results analysis. In this chapter, after providing a survey on validation approaches for XACML based access control systems, we present a <b>coverage</b> <b>based</b> selection strategy and a similarity based test prioritization solution, both applied to XACML test cases. Then we compare the effectiveness of the two approaches in terms of mutation score and number of test cases. Experimental results show that <b>coverage</b> <b>based</b> selection outperforms similarity based prioritization, hinting to future improvements of the proposed approaches...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) is {{a dynamic}} network which the mobile node {{does not have any}} infrastructure. Link breakages exist due to its high mobility of nodes which leads to frequent path failures and route discoveries. In broadcasting mechanism, the mobile node blindly rebroadcasts the first received route request, even if there is no route to destination leads to broadcast storm problem. Attacks are the main issues in Mobile ad hoc networks such as DoS, Wormhole attacks etc. In this paper an Attack Detection and Prevention algorithm (ADPA) is implemented with Neighbor <b>Coverage</b> <b>based</b> Probabilistic Rebroadcast Protocol (NCPR) for ensuring security along with improved performance in the network. ADPA detects and prevents the attacker nodes more effectively. The neighbor <b>coverage</b> <b>based</b> probabilistic rebroadcast protocol, exploits the neighbor coverage knowledge by rebroadcast delay and obtains additional coverage ratio. Connectivity factor is defined and it is combined with additional coverage ratio to set rebroadcast probability. The neighbor coverage and probabilistic mechanism significantly decreases the number of retransmissions so as to reduce the routing overhead.

40|$|Abstract. The rapid {{increase}} {{in the amount of}} available information from various online sources poses new challenges for programs that endeavor to process these sources automatically and identify the most relevant material for a given application. This paper introduces an approach for optimizing queries to Semantic Web resources based on ideas originally proposed by MacQueen for optimal stopping in business economics. Modeling applications as decision makers looking for optimal action/answer sets, facing search costs for acquiring information, test costs for checking these information, and receiving a reward depending on the usefulness of the proposed solution, yields strategies for optimizing queries to external services. An extensive evaluation compares these strategies to a conventional <b>coverage</b> <b>based</b> approach, based on real world response times taken from popular Web services. ...|$|R
