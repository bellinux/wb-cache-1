We show that some pseudocodewords cause decoding errors, but that there are also pseudocodewords that frequently correct the deleterious effects of other pseudocodewords. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent works {{showed how}} low-density parity-check (LDPC) erasure {{correcting}} codes, under maximum likelihood (ML) decoding, {{are capable of}} tightly approaching the performance of an ideal maximum-distance-separable code on the binary erasure channel. Such result is achievable down to low error rates, even for small and moderate block sizes, while keeping the decoding complexity low, thanks to a class of decoding algorithms which exploits the sparseness of the paritycheck matrix to reduce the complexity of Gaussian elimination (GE). In this paper the main concepts underlying ML decoding of LDPC codes are recalled. A performance analysis among various LDPC code classes is then carried out, including a comparison with fixed-rate Raptor codes. The results show that LDPC and Raptor codes provide almost identical performance in terms of decoding failure probability vs. overhead.

40|$|Abstract—We are {{describing}} an algorithm for {{channel parameter}} tracking for application in channel sounding measurement. At first, we derive a data model for so called blockwise estimation. For the parameter estimation {{we use a}} coordinate-wise optimization for the global search and a gradient based algorithm for the local search. Moreover, the Fisherinformation matrix which is calculated throughout the optimization procedure, provides a variance estimate of the parameters. In contrast to known channel parameter estimators, the proposed algorithm additionally yields an estimation of the dynamic parameters, e. g. variation of time delay and azimuth angle. Block-wise channel parameter estimation considerably improves parameter tracking and, thus, enhances the accuracy and robustness of path parameter analysis. It gives also {{more information on the}} dynamic channel parameter characteristics and allows investigation of the microscopic path statistics.

It has been hypothesized that cytoplasmic calcium concentrations control the homeostatic activity sensors. This raises many questions for PCs since in these neurons calcium {{plays an important role}} in the induction of synaptic plasticity. To address this question, we generated 148 new PC models. In these models the somatic membrane voltages are stable, but the somatic calcium dynamics are very variable, in agreement with experimental results. Conversely, the calcium signal in spiny dendrites shows only small variability. We demonstrate that this localized control of calcium conductances preserves the induction of long-term depression for all models. We conclude that calcium is unlikely to be the sole activity-sensor in this cell but that there is a strong relationship between activity homeostasis and synaptic plasticity...|$|E

Under this setup orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) {{is used as a}} physical layer scheme; it also involves the use of pilots in the OFDM symbol for channel estimation.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} the {{decoding}} capabilities of convolu-tional codes over the erasure channel are studied. Of special interest will be maximum distance profile (MDP) convolutional codes. These are codes {{which have a}} maximum possible column distance increase. It is shown how this strong minimum distance condition of MDP convolutional codes {{help us to solve}} error situations that maximum distance separable (MDS) block codes fail to solve. Towards this goal, two subclasses of MDP codes are defined: reverse-MDP convolutional codes and complete-MDP convolutional codes. Reverse-MDP codes have the capability to recover a maximum number of erasures using an algorithm which runs backward in time. Complete-MDP convolutional codes are both MDP and reverse-MDP codes. They are capable to recover the state of the decoder under the mildest condition. It is shown that complete-MDP convolutional codes perform in many cases better than comparable MDS block codes of the same rate over the erasure channel.

40|$|Abstract—While exisiting {{weighted}} fair scheduling schemes guarantee minimum bandwidths for classes/sessions in {{a shared}} <b>channel,</b> <b>maximum</b> rate control, which {{is critical to}} service providers and carriers for resource management and business strategies, was generally enforced by employing policing mechanisms. The previous approaches use either a concatenation of rate controller and scheduler, or a policer in front of scheduler. The concatenation method uses two sets of queues and management aparartus, and thus incurs overhead. The other method allows bursty traffic to pass through that can violate maximum rate constraint or cause a high packet loss rate. In this paper, we present a new weighted fair scheduling scheme, WF 2 Q-M, to simultaneously support maximum rate control and minimum service rate guarantee. WF 2 Q-M proposes the virtual clock adjustment method to enforce maximum rate control by distributing the excess bandwidths of maximum rate constrained sessions to other sessions without recalculating the virtual starting and finishing times of regular sessionss. In terms of performance metrics, we prove that WF 2 Q-M is theoretically bounded by a fluid reference model. A procedural scheduling implementation of WF 2 Q-M is proposed and proof of correctness is given. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the performance of WF 2 Q-M is just as we claimed...|$|E

However, vacuum tubes are operated in high voltage level. Meanwhile, {{in order to work}} in low voltage level, a vacuum tube amplifier must employ step down transformers that leads to complexity. This study aims to make use of vacuum tubes in a pre-amplifier working on 12 VDC level. First, several measurements were done to obtain graphics of characteristic of triode 12 AT 7 in low voltage level. Common-cathode topology was cascaded with a common-anode topology to realize such amplifier.

To increase understanding of these interactions we explore the concepts of Road and Stream Network Connectivity (R/S Connectivity) and Road and Stream Network Connectivity Potential (RSNCP). Lastly we provide a methodology for study and analysis of R/S connectivity. This study focuses on road induced alterations to sediment and water flow processes, which are important road effects of R/S connectivity. For 25 river road crossings (RRC) in the Rio Mameyes and Rio Espiritu watersheds of Northeastern Puerto Rico, a multi-scale Geographic Information Systems (GIS) database measuring environmental and road characteristic variables was developed specifically to measure variables influencing sediment and water flow. Multivariate analysis methods were used to select the environmental and road characteristic variables which were used in multiple linear regression models for three biota variables (Decapod Richness, Adult Fish Richness, and Total Richness), and four stream habitat geomorphology variables (Median Channel Grain Size, Active <b>Channel</b> <b>Maximum</b> Depth, Pool Volume, and Active Channel Width).

In this paper, Forward Error Correction (FEC) is applied across multiple independent paths to enhance the endto-end reliability. Internet paths are modeled as erasure Gilbert-Elliot channels [1], [2]. First, it is shown that over any erasure <b>channel,</b> <b>Maximum</b> Distance Separable (MDS) codes achieve the minimum probability of irrecoverable loss among all block codes of the same size. Then, based on the adopted model for Internet paths, we prove that the probability of irrecoverable loss for MDS codes decays exponentially for the asymptotically large number of paths. Moreover, it is shown that in the optimal rate allocation, each path is assigned a positive rate iff its quality is above a certain threshold. The quality of a path {{is defined as the}} percentage of the time it spends in the bad state. In other words, including a redundant path improves the reliability iff this condition is satisfied. Finally, using dynamic programming, a heuristic suboptimal algorithm with polynomial runtime is proposed for rate allocation over the available paths. This algorithm converges to the asymptotically optimal rate allocation when the number of paths is large. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm approximates the optimal rate allocation very closely for the practical number of paths, and provides significant performance improvement compared to the alternative schemes of rate allocation...|$|E
