It remains {{at that level}} of accolade as of the 2013 Michelin Guide. El <b>Celler</b> de Can Roca has been listed in The World's 50 Best Restaurants by Restaurant magazine since 2006 when it was ranked 21st. In 2009 it was ranked fifth and was awarded the prize for being the highest climbing restaurant on the list. In 2010, it rose one place to fourth and in 2011, 2012 and 2014, it was ranked in second place behind Danish New Nordic cuisine restaurant Noma, with fellow Spanish restaurant Mugaritz in third place. On 29 April 2013 the {{restaurant was}} named {{the best in the}} world. In The Daily Meal's inaugural list of the best 101 restaurants in Europe in 2012, El <b>Celler</b> de Can Roca was ranked twelfth.

5|$|Emanuel <b>Celler</b> (D-NY), Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, {{introduced}} the Voting Rights Act in the House of Representatives on March 19, 1965 as H.R. 6400. The House Judiciary Committee {{was the first}} committee to consider the bill. The committee's ranking Republican, William McCulloch (R-OH), generally supported expanding voting rights, but he opposed both the poll tax ban and the coverage formula, and he led opposition to the bill in committee. The committee eventually approved the bill on May 12, {{but it did not}} file its committee report until June 1. The bill included two amendments from subcommittee: a penalty for private persons who interfered with the right to vote, and a prohibition of all poll taxes. The poll tax prohibition gained Speaker of the House John McCormack's support. The bill was next considered by the Rules Committee, whose chair, Howard W. Smith (D-VA), opposed the bill and delayed its consideration until June 24, when <b>Celler</b> initiated proceedings to have the bill discharged from committee. Under pressure from the bill's proponents, Smith allowed the bill to be released a week later, and the full House started debating the bill on July 6.|$|E

Also, their proposal provided a way to fill a vacancy in the office of Vice President before the next presidential election. This was as opposed to the Keating–Kefauver proposal, which neither provided for filling a vacancy in the office of Vice President prior to the next presidential election nor provided a process for determining presidential disability. In 1964, the American Bar Association endorsed the type of proposal which Bayh and <b>Celler</b> advocated. On January 28, 1965, President Johnson endorsed S. J. Res. 1 in a statement to Congress.

O'Malley forbade the speaking of Rickey's name in Dodgers offices with transgressors {{being subjected to}} a fine. He abolished Rickey's title of General Manager so that no front office person could perpetuate Rickey's role. In addition, when Rickey assumed the title with the Pittsburgh Pirates, O'Malley arranged for the Dodgers to omit the Pirates from their spring training schedule. Nonetheless, after the transfer, the Dodgers remained successful under O'Malley: they won the National League pennants in , , [...] -- the year of their first World Series championship -- and [...] Under O'Malley, the Dodgers were the most overtly political post World War II franchise. In 1951, Brooklyn native and United States Congressman Emanuel Celler's Judiciary Committee investigated whether the reserve clause was in violation of federal anti-trust laws. <b>Celler</b> represented half of Brooklyn in Congress and O'Malley used the local press such as the Brooklyn Eagle to pressure <b>Celler</b> into backing off of the issue. During the 1951 season, the Dodgers engaged former West Point varsity baseball player and U.S. Army General Douglas MacArthur to lure war veterans. [...] O'Malley attempted to entice {{him to take the}} post of Commissioner of Baseball.

500|$|Nazi pledges of nondiscrimination {{in sports}} proved {{inconsistent}} with their actions, {{such as the}} expulsion of Jews from sports clubs, and in September 1934, Brundage sailed for Germany to see for himself.

[...] Brundage's trip only increased the controversy over the question of US participation, with New York Congressman Emanuel <b>Celler</b> stating that Brundage [...] "had prejudged the situation before he sailed from America". Nevertheless, on September 26, 1934, after hearing a report from Brundage on conditions in Germany, the AOC voted to send a US team to Berlin.|$|E
5000|$|René Barbier III was {{descended from}} a family of French winemakers {{although}} he was born in Tarragona and grew up in Catalonia.

5000|$|Sedgely Abbey, an 18th-century {{plantation}} {{house on}} the lower Cape Fear River in North Carolina was built of locally quarried coquina. The house that once stood on a vast tract of land directly {{across the river from}} Orton was described by local historian and author James Sprunt in [...] "Tales and Traditions of the Lower Cape Fear 1661-1896" [...] (Le Gwin Brothers Printers, Wilmington, NC., 1896) as: [...] "the grandest colonial residence of the Cape Fear". Sprunt compared Sedgeley Abbey in dimensions and appearance to the two-story, <b>cellered,</b> Governor Dudley mansion that still stands in Wilmington. Like many southern plantations, Sedgeley Abbey fell into disrepair after the Civil War. The vacant house was demolished in the 1870s and the coquina rubble was burned and used for fertilizer.

Vorilhon had a passion for the songs of Belgian singer Jacques Brel, and tried to imitate his singing style.

500|$|The {{amendment}} {{which came}} closest to success was the Bayh–Celler proposal during the 91st Congress (January 1969 – January 1971). Introduced by Representative Emanuel <b>Celler</b> of New York as House Joint Resolution 681, {{it would have}} replaced the Electoral College with a simpler plurality system based on the national popular vote. Under this system, the pair of candidates who had received {{the highest number of}} votes would win the presidency and vice presidency respectively, providing they won at least 40% of the national popular vote. If no pair received 40% of the popular vote, a runoff election would be held, in which the choice of president and vice president would be made from the two pairs of persons who had received the highest numbers of votes in the first election. The word [...] "pair" [...] was defined as [...] "two persons who shall have consented to the joining of their names as candidates for the offices of President and Vice President". Celler's proposed constitutional amendment passed in the House of Representatives by a 338–70 vote in 1969, but was filibustered in the Senate, where it died.|$|E

40|$|Correlated color {{temperature}} (CCT) is a semi-quantitative system that roughly describes the spectra of lamps. This parameter gives the temperature (measured in kelvins) {{of the black}} body that would show the hue more {{similar to that of}} the light emitted by the lamp. Modern lamps for indoor and outdoor lighting display many spectral energy distributions, most of them extremely different to those of black bodies, what makes CCT to be far from a perfect descriptor from the physical point of view. The spectral index system presented in this work provides an accurate, objective, quantitative procedure to characterize the spectral properties of lamps, with just a few numbers. The system is an adaptation to lighting technology of the classical procedures of multi-band astronomical photometry with wide and intermediate-band filters. We describe the basic concepts and we apply the system to a representative set of lamps of many kinds. The results lead to interesting, sometimes surprising conclusions. The spectral index system is extremely easy to implement from the spectral data that are routinely measured at laboratories. Thus, including this kind of computations in the standard protocols for the certification of lamps will be really straightforward, and will enrich the technical description of lighting devices.
