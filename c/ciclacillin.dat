50|$|<b>Ciclacillin</b> (INN) or cyclacillin (USAN), {{trade names}} Cyclapen, Cyclapen-W, Vastcillin, and others, is an {{aminopenicillin}} antibiotic. Its {{spectrum of activity}} {{is similar to that}} of ampicillin, although it is less susceptible to beta-lactamases than ampicillin and has much higher bioavailability. A large randomized, double-blind clinical trial published in 1978 also showed that <b>ciclacillin</b> is associated with significantly fewer and milder adverse effects than ampicillin; later studies seemed to confirm this improved tolerability, at least in children.|$|E
