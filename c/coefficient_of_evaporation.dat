40|$|Abstract – In {{this study}} a simple {{simulation}} {{model for the}} design of microcatchment water harvesting systems for rain-fed tree cultures in the Bajgah area, Fars province, I. R. of Iran, was developed. The actual daily evapotranspiration was calculated during the years 1984 to 1987. This model has been calibrated based on 34 measured volumetric soil water contents at depths of 120 cm, and soil water at depths of 0 - 120 cm in the study area. To calculate the daily actual evapotranspiration during these years, daily crop coefficient, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> from the soil surface, mean daily soil water stress coefficient for four years (1984 - 1987) and the Penman-FAO method for the calculation of reference crop potential evapotranspiration (ETo) were used. The results indicated that the total amounts of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for growing seasons were 407, 346, 376 and 362 mm (mean value of 373 mm). Also, the values of yearly ETa were 537, 472, 488 and 485 mm (mean value of 496 mm). Furthermore, a simple method based on Type III Pearson distribution and Penman-FAO ETo was used to estimate the amount of actual evapotranspiration for different probabilities of occurrence in each month of the year. So, the total amount of actual evapotranspiration during the growing season can be obtained for different probabilities of occurrence. Moreover, by using the yearly actual evapotranspiration and yearl...|$|E
40|$|A {{major concern}} to the National Weather Service marine {{operations}} {{is the problem of}} forecasting advection fogs at sea. Currently fog forecasts are issued using statistical methods only over the open ocean domain but no such system is available for coastal and offshore areas. We propose to use a partially diagnostic model, designed specifically for this problem, which relies on output fields from the global operational Medium Range Forecast (MRF) model. The boundary and initial conditions of moisture and temperature, as well as the MRF's horizontal wind predictions are interpolated to the fog model grid over an arbitrarily selected coastal and offshore ocean region. The moisture fields are used to prescribe a droplet size distribution and compute liquid water content, neither of which is accounted for in the global model. Fog development is governed by the droplet size distribution and advection and exchange of heat and moisture. A simple parameterization is used to describe the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> and sensible heat exchange at the surface.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} waste heat-driven adsorption desalination (AD) cycles offer {{high potential}} {{as one of}} the most economically viable and environmental-friendly desalination methods. This article presents the development of an advanced adsorption desalination cycle that employs internal heat recovery between the evaporator and the condenser, utilizing an encapsulated evaporator-condenser unit for effective heat transfer. A simulation model has been developed based on the actual sorption characteristics of the adsorbent-adsorbate pair, energy and mass balances applied to the components of the AD cycle. With an integrated design, the temperature in the evaporator and the vapor pressurization of the adsorber are raised due to the direct heat recovery from the condenser, resulting in the higher water production rates, typically improved by as much as three folds of the conventional AD cycle. In addition, the integrated design eliminates two pumps, namely, the condenser cooling water and the chilled water pumps, lowering the overall electricity consumption. The performance of the cycle is analyzed at assorted heat source and cooling water temperatures, and different cycle times as well as the transient heat transfer <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evaporation</b> and condensation. © 2012 Elsevier B.

Pan evaporation has been decreasing {{in the past few}} decades over many large areas with differing climates globally. This study analyzes pan evaporation data from 671 stations in China over the past 50 years in order to reveal the trends of it and the corresponding trend attribution. Mann-Kendall test shows a significant declining trend in pan evaporation for most stations, with an average decrease of 17. 2 mm/ 10 a in China as a whole, the rate of decline was the steepest in the humid region (29. 7 mm/ 10 a), and was 17. 6 mm/ 10 a and 5. 5 mm/ 10 a in the semi-humid/semi-arid region and arid region, respectively.

40|$|Predicting {{the flow}} of water between the soil surface and the {{atmosphere}} is a critical issue which geotechnical engineers must resolve for many practical problems. The analysis of saturated-unsaturated groundwater flow problems requires the specification of the flux of water at the upper soil boundary. The flow of moisture at the ground surface is also important for many problems in soil mechanics. These include the analysis of volume change in expansive soils and the stability of slopes. The transfer of water across the soil-atmosphere surface occurs as infiltration and <b>evaporation.</b> The mechanics <b>of</b> infiltration into the soil surface is well understood and has been widely addressed in the literature. Alternately, the process <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> from the soil surface is poorly understood. Extreme difficulties frequently arise while predicting evaporation from unsaturated soil surfaces. Empirical methods <b>of</b> estimating <b>evaporation</b> from unsaturated soil surfaces {{can be found in the}} literature: however, the suitability and accuracy of these methods can be questioned. A theoretical approach for evaluating the rate <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> from an unsaturated soil surface is developed. The theory is based on the principles of Darcy's Law and Fick's Law to describe {{the flow of}} liquid water and water vapour in the saturated-unsaturated soil below the surface. Dalton's Law and a modified form of Penman's Method for evaporation are utilized to predict evaporation from the soil surface. Drying tests were conducted using three distinct soil types of sand, silt and clay. The soil surfaces were found to evaporate at the same rate as free water surfaces when saturated. The rate <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> begins to decline once the soil surfaces become unsaturated and total suction exceed approximately 3000 kPa. The rate <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> is proportional to total suction and continues to decline as suction increases. This principle appears independent of soil type and universal for the three texturally distinct soils selected for testing. The rate <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> may be predicted on the basis of the water content of the soil and its moisture retention curve established using routine test procedures. The proposed theory was used to simulate the results of a 42 day evaporation test for a column of fine, uniform, clean sand. Good agreement was generally found between the computed and measured values <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> rate, soil water content and soil temperature. Additional analyses were conducted using various values <b>of</b> the saturated <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability and the pore-size distribution index. The computed evaporative fluxes were found to be very sensitive to the permeability of the soil. Varying the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> molecular diffusion for water vapour was also found to influence the rate <b>of</b> <b>evaporation.</b> The modified Penman expression was applied to an example evaporation problem for Saskatoon, Saskatchewan during a 10 day period in July. The evaporative fluxes were computed with the watertable positioned at several depths below the surface of the sand. Evaporative rates were found to vary widely between the full potential rate of 7. 7 mm/day and 0. 4 mm/day depending on the position of the water table. In general, the results showed that the rate <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> from a soil surface depends strongly on the groundwater conditions...|$|R
