40|$|General Production Information Peas are a {{vegetable}} crop of major importance in NY. Just under 20, 000 acreas are produced, almost entirely for processing into frozen or canned products. A {{small percentage of}} the crop moves through fresh market channels, mostly within the state. Peas are attacked by relatively few pests compared to most other vegetables, and pesticide use in peas is relatively low. Seed-treatment fungicides are critical for controlling seed decay, root rot, and some seed-borne diseases. Insect pests are infrequent in peas; weeds are by far the biggest pest problem. Without the registration of new, effective materials to replace them, the loss of MCPB or bentazon would have significant impacts on production and profitability. Producers have a great need for new herbicide registrations, especially for materials which will help control problem weeds such as <b>Canada</b> <b>thistles</b> and daisies. Registration of new materials by the EPA, even those designated as "low risk", does not guarantee that NY growers will have immediate access to them. NYS Department of Environmental Conservation conducts their own in-depth reviews before registering new pesticides in NY, and may or may not register new materials for portions of or for the entire state.

40|$|Urban {{expansion}} has led {{to native}} habitat destruction. Meanwhile, cities produce large quantities of plant residue wastes. To explore the potential to use plant residues to restore native habitats in cities, this thesis compared the short-term effects of deciduous leaf litter and plant residue compost on topsoil quality and seeded native herbaceous plant establishment. To determine if natural plant colonisation alone can restore native plants, the thesis compared the establishment and ecological characteristic and diversity of naturally colonised plant species on the barren surface of modified and unmodified soil. Following three months of repeated measurements after amendment, compost significantly increased soil moisture, organic matter, extractable NPK, and significantly decreased soil pH and bulk density. The decrease in soil pH due to incorporating compost with higher pH than the receiving soil showed that compost may not restore soil pH in a predictable manner. The average number and median shoot lengths of seeded native plants on compost-amended soil {{were significantly higher than}} those on control three months after germination. Compost may therefore be used for purposes such as quick establishment of dense tall native plant cover. Conversely, leaf litter did not significantly change the abovementioned soil properties in the short term. However, the average number of seeded native plants on leaf litter-amended soil three months after germination was significantly higher than control and insignificantly different from that on compost-amended soil. At that time, seeded native plants on leaf litter-soil exhibited stunt growth relative to other treatments. Leaf litter might then be used to establishing slow-growth native lawns for urban native landscaping practices. But this technique requires further refinement. Above barren soils across experimental treatments, exotic weeds consisted mostly of the naturally colonised plants. This means natural plant colonisation may not effectively restore native plants. There {{was no significant difference in}} the colonising plant average species richness and diversity across treatments. The steepness of the colonising speciesâ€™ rank-abundance curves were similar between treatments. Thus, natural plant colonisation on amended or un-amended soil could not lead to the establishment of particular plant species. Due to soil nutrient-enrichment, <b>Canada</b> <b>thistles</b> (Cirsium arvense) occupied a greater proportion of colonised species on compost-treated soil than the most dominant colonised species on other types of soil. Thus, compost amendment of soil may not restore plant communities with high species diversity. Moreover, the average number of the colonising weeds above compost-amended soil was significantly higher than control, while that of weeds above leaf litter-amended soil was significantly lower than control three months after site preparation. At that time, weeds on leaf litter-amended soil were significantly shorter than those on compost-amended soil and control. This means leaf litter could impede exotic weeds while compost had the reverse effect. Compost should only be used to establish native plants if exotic weeds are removed or when the site soil seed bank and adjacent land contain few exotics. While this thesis documented the different short-term effects of plant residue compost and deciduous leaf litter on soil and plants, long-term investigations may find potentially different applications for the different types of plant residues in native plant restoration projects with different purposes. Reusing plant residues differentially could mean that composting may not always be necessary in plant waste management and urban ecological restoration may help to reduce waste output from cities...|$|R

(Californian, <b>Canada</b> or {{creeping}} <b>thistle)</b> is {{an exotic}} perennial herb that successfully established in New Zealand (NZ) approximately 130 years ago, {{and is now}} {{considered one of the}} worst invasive weeds in NZ arable and pastoral systems. Two insects, Cassida rubiginosa and Ceratapion onopordi, were recently released for classical biological control. Studies carried out from 2006 to 2009 in both the native (Europe) and introduced (NZ) ranges of the plant aimed to quantify C. arvense growth characteristics and assess incidence of the specialised rust pathogen, Puccinia punctiformis, in regions with and without the supposed pathogen vector, C. onopordi. In permanent field plots natural enemies were excluded with insecticides and fungicides, and compared with controls. The impact of C. rubiginosa was also assessed under different pasture competition scenarios. The survey data indicate that C. arvense expresses similar growth characteristics in both ranges, and that incidence of the rust pathogen is similar in both ranges, regardless of the presence of C. onopordi. The data suggest that the overall suite of natural enemies is capable of exerting some regulating influence on the plant in its native range, but that the released biocontrol agents will not likely {{have a significant impact on}} this weed in NZ...|$|R
40|$|Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. (Californian, <b>Canada,</b> or {{creeping}} <b>thistle)</b> is {{an exotic}} perennial herb indigenous to Eurasia that successfully established in New Zealand (NZ) approximately 130 years ago. Presently, C. arvense {{is considered one}} of the worst invasive weeds in NZ arable and pastoral productions systems. The mechanism most commonly invoked to explain the apparent increased vigour of introduced weeds is release from natural enemies. The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) predicts that plants in an introduced range should experience reduced herbivory, particularly from specialists, and that release from this natural enemy pressure facilitates increased plant performance in the introduced range. In 2007 broad surveys were carried out in NZ and central Europe in order to quantify and compare growth characteristics of C. arvense in its native vs. introduced range. Additionally, permanent field plots were established in NZ and Europe where natural enemies were excluded with the use of insecticide and fungicide applications, and compared with controls (ambient natural enemy pressure). The impact of the specialist leaf-feeding beetle, Cassida rubiginosa MÃ¼ller, which was recently released in NZ as a biological control agent against thistles, was also assessed. From the field surveys, significantly more endophagous herbivory was present in the native range compared to the introduced range, as predicted by the ERH. Endophagous herbivory in NZ was solely from the capitulum-feeding weevil, Rhinocyllus conicus (FrÃ¶lich), and was only found in the North Island surveys. No stem mining attack was found anywhere in NZ. The proportion of shoots attacked by the specialised rust pathogen, Puccinia punctiformis (Str.) RÃ¶hl., was similar in both the native and introduced ranges. Interestingly, this has casted doubt on the idea that stem-mining vectors, such as Ceratapion onopordi Kirby, are important for transmission of the rust pathogen. Contrary to the ERH, there were no significant difference in plant performance between the native and introduced ranges, or differences could be explained by simple climatic factors. Climate tended to be more favourable for growth of C. arvense in NZ. In the permanent field plots in the native range, population growth of C. arvense was significantly greater where natural enemies were excluded, suggesting that insect herbivores and pathogens might have a regulating influence on the population growth of this plant. Furthermore, the probability of shoots transitioning to the reproductive growth stage was enhanced when insect herbivores were excluded, indicating that natural enemies might influence plant development. The biological control agent C. rubiginosa reduced the growth of C. arvense, although the impact of this herbivore was minimal in comparison to interspecific plant competition. Thus, although there is reduced specialist natural enemy pressure in NZ, the growth of C. arvense is not significantly different from in its native range. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that natural enemies in the native range might have a regulating influence on the population dynamics of the plant, and that the specialist herbivore, C. rubiginosa, can impact the plant in certain conditions...|$|R

Even after the ordinance of 1787, the settlers in Indiana and Illinois (it was all one government then) tried to get Congress to allow slavery temporarily, and petitions to that end were sent from Kaskaskia, and General Harrison, the Governor, urged it from Vincennes the capital. If that had succeeded, good-bye to liberty here. But John Randolph of Virginia made a vigorous report against it; and although they persevered so well as to get three favourable reports for it, yet the United States Senate, with the aid of some slave States, finally squelched it for good. [Applause.] And that is why this hall is to-day a temple for free men instead of a negro livery stable.

And others do the same; and in those ways slavery gets a sure foothold. And when that is done the whole mighty Union--the force of the nation--is committed to its support. And that very process is working in Kansas to-day. And you must recollect that the slave property is worth a billion of dollars ($1,000,000,000); while free-State men must work for sentiment alone.
