25|$|At the 1884–85 Berlin Conference {{and related}} {{bilateral}} negotiations between Britain and Belgium, the land west {{and north of}} the Luapula River−Lake Mweru system (Katanga) was allocated to the Congo Free State while the land {{to the east and}} south was allocated to Britain and the BSAC. However the agreements included a Principle of Effectivity under which each colonial power had to set up an effective presence in the territory—by obtaining treaties from local tribal chiefs, flying their flag, and setting up an administration and police force to keep order—to confirm the claim. If they did not, a rival could <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> so, thereby 'legally' taking over the territory {{in the eyes of the}} civilized powers. In 1890 neither colonial power had treaties or an effective presence in Katanga, and as reports came of gold and copper being found in Katanga, the stage was set for a race between the BSAC and Free State.|$|E

His widow Barbara Shutner said:My husband Logan English and I met Bob Dylan at Bob and Sid Gleason's house...

500|$|In this episode, Michael Scott {{describes}} the Dundies as [...] "like the Golden Globes but less mean" [...] referring to Ricky Gervais' hosting of the 2011 Golden Globe Awards; which left critics questioning {{if he had}} gone [...] "too far". As {{executive producer of the}} American series and creator of the original British series, Gervais stated on his blog that the line was inserted as a metajoke was intended as [...] "a little in-joke". Near the beginning of the episode, Deangelo compares Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) house to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Michael notes that [...] "When Larry King died, they didn't just cancel his show", showing that Michael is unaware that Larry King is not deceased. Later, he notes that [...] "they got Piers Morgan to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> his show" [...] instead. The final song that the office sings to Michael is a parody of [...] "Seasons of Love" [...] from the Broadway musical Rent. Dwight later reveals in a talking head that he is always the padawan learner, and never a Jedi knight, a reference to the 1977 film Star Wars and its franchise. Michael notes that he wanted his last Dundies celebration to be like the 1990 film The Godfather Part III, rather than the [...] "confusing" [...] 1972 film The Godfather I, which he notes had [...] "three big laughs". Additionally, the episode contains several references to the film The King's Speech, notably during the scene in which Deangelo gives his speech at the Dundies while listening to his Walkman played at a high volume.|$|E

I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember I rang Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, {{but there was no way}} I could do it.

[...] Tara was equally certain that algebra wasn't {{going to take her}} anywhere. Her family moved to Niagara Falls in her sophomore year in high school. The house in West Hill had a gravel driveway, making a basketball hoop impractical, but when her parents got her a hoop for Christmas when they were in Niagara Falls. By then, she thought she was too old for basketball, although she would take it up again after she transferred to Buffalo Seminary, an all-girls college preparatory school, in her junior year.

2500|$|After some speculation, {{the cast}} for War Horse was {{announced}} on 17 June 2010. It had been rumoured {{in the previous}} week that Eddie Redmayne had been cast in the lead part as Albert Narracott; however, relatively unknown stage actor Jeremy Irvine was chosen instead. Spielberg commented after seeing hundreds of young boys reading for the role, Irvine had <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>done</b> a cold reading and that [...] "his performance was very natural, very authentic." [...] Irvine auditioned for two months, going {{in two or three}} times a week, and learned that he had the part when he was asked to read a piece of War Horse script on camera in order to check his West Country accent, and the piece of mocked-up script that he read out was Albert telling Joey that Steven Spielberg wanted him to play the part.|$|R

Berry had appeared in a couple of films prior to being cast in Boomerang. However, after Berry performed her screen test, Murphy told Hudlin [...] "well, that's it. There's no need to see the other two actresses because she's the part." [...] Executives at Paramount Pictures were nervous about Robin Givens being cast in such {{a major role in the}} film, as she was disliked by many in the general public at the time because of her past relationship with Mike Tyson. Hudlin however, [...] "thought that actually made her perfect for the role, that she was this formidable person, and a match for Eddie Murphy, who also had an increpid reputation as a ladies' man.

2500|$|This season {{features}} more original material than previous seasons. The deviations from Martin's novels are in part {{attributable to the}} way the television series has covered most of the novel series' published material and in part to the directors' opinions of the actors' abilities. For example, Sansa Stark arrives at Winterfell to marry Ramsay Bolton in [...] "High Sparrow," [...] a plotline that had been given to a minor character in the novels. In an interview, show writer David Benioff explains that Sophie Turner's development as an actress {{was one of the reasons}} that they decided to give her character more dramatic scenes, saying, [...] "Even if [...] <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> a great audition, it’s so hard to know if they’re going to quite literally grow into the parts. With Sansa and Arya in particular, their storylines have become quite dark. It was such a gamble and the fact that they’ve both become such great wonderful actresses is a bit of a miracle." [...] Bryan Cogman added that it made more sense to give the Winterfell storyline to a proven actress who was already popular with viewers than to bring in a new character.|$|E
2500|$|Douglas found Stern's next job, hosting mornings at album-oriented rock station WWDC in Washington, D.C. Stern was {{cautious}} about the offer at first {{as the general}} manager [...] "was not really aware of what I did", but accepted the offer and started on March 2, 1981. During his time relocating from Detroit, Stern spent several weeks planning out a new show, determined to become more successful as the station presented a good chance for him to work in New York City, his career goal. He was determined to [...] "kill my competition. I {{was going to say}} whatever the fuck I was going to say ... The first step was to put my team together". He sought a co-host {{with a sense of humor}} to riff with on news and current events. The station then paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a former nurse in the air force and news reporter at WFBR in Baltimore. Quivers was sent a tape of Stern interviewing a prostitute on the air, and accepted the job without meeting him. She assumed she [...] "would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> the news ... but it wasn't that way". Despite several issues management had over content, which led to the installation of a seven-second delay to censor questionable moments, Stern [...] "kept chipping away at management's archaic approach and we began to assemble the program I had envisioned", which included the addition of Norris as his writer and producer. In one incident, Stern revealed his wife's miscarriage on the air. In January 1982, Stern had the second highest rated morning show in the city.|$|E
2500|$|On March 2, 1981, Stern {{began his}} third morning job at WWDC, a rock station in Washington, D.C. He was {{determined}} to become a success, and noticed the importance of news segments for satire. He wished for a news person to riff {{with him in the}} studio. Management paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a news anchor and consumer reporter from WFBR in Baltimore, who agreed to meet Stern after hearing him interview a prostitute on the air. Quivers at first [...] "thought I would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> the news...but it wasn't that way...he wanted someone to play off of...he wanted a real live person there with him". The show began to break format, and Stern held a lesbian edition of [...] "Dial-a-Date" [...] in May 1981. He formed the Think Tank, a cohesive trio of male listeners who conversed with Stern and played along with quizzes and routines, which helped the show sound more natural. By January 1982, Stern had the second highest-rated morning program in the city. On January 14, one day after the crash of Air Florida Flight 90, Stern made believe he asked Air Florida the price of a one-way ticket to the 14th Street Bridge, the location of the disaster. [...] "Is that going to be a permanent stop?" [...] asked Stern. On June 29, 1982, Stern's contract at WWDC was terminated. He writes that the Air Florida segment was not the reason for his departure, nor did anyone complain about it. He had signed a contract with WNBC in March, and began to berate management and other DJ's on the air. Quivers, who left the show early on June 17, worked at WCBM in Baltimore until rejoining with Stern on October 18, 1982. Stern presented a farewell show two weeks later on competing station WAVA-FM. He had more than tripled the station's ratings during his stay.|$|E

As the writing staff had a hard time coming up with a story, Spotnitz saw {{this as an opportunity to}} further evolve Doggett, the new character introduced at the beginning of the eighth season. In order to fill Anderson's void, two recurring groups of characters were brought in: Walter Skinner and The Lone Gunmen. Spotnitz noted that, [...] "we were eager to get Skinner out from behind the desk, and we were always looking for opportunities to get him out of that office and get him into the field." [...] Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, was pleased with the final product. He later complimented the work of Robert Patrick, who played Doggett, saying, [...] "It was a big hole when Mulder was gone, but I thought that Robert <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> a wonderful job.

The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision.
