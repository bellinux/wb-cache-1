However, one month later, Kent County Council contacted the Association and informed them that the Council's intended purchase of the land would save taxpayers the sum of £120,000 and, furthermore, that in the event British Railways were unwilling to sell the land to it, as had been intimated, compulsory purchase powers would be used. Faced with the prospect of a <b>compulsory</b> <b>sale,</b> British Railways now broke off negotiations with the Association and agreed to sell the line to the Council.|$|E
25|$|Schumacher cites that William Howard Taft, {{the head}} of the Second Philippine Commission and the first civil {{governor}} of the Philippine Islands, was very much aware of the need to defuse anti-friar feeling throughout the islands. He requested the Spanish friars be given leave of their parish posts. Many of the friars left voluntarily, and were replaced by native Filipino priests in lower ranks and American bishops in the ranks of the episcopacy. Negotiations also began for the <b>compulsory</b> <b>sale</b> of vast Roman Catholic Church holdings. Although the sale was affected by pressure from influential sectors like some bishops and certain delegates, it achieved Taft’s goal of sequestering all the Roman Catholic Church lands, something that the ill-fated Philippine Republic had failed to achieve. After taking the land, the governor intended to redistribute the land. This not only reduced the financial position of the Roman Catholic Church, but also diminished the influential clout it had during the Spanish colonial period.|$|E

5000|$|The {{injunction}} requiring part sales originally {{applied to}} all parts.The Ninth Circuit limited the injunction to parts made by Kodak, since the ISOs could now buy such parts from their independent manufacturers. Kodak argued that on parts for which it had a copyright or patent monopoly, it {{should be allowed to}} charge monopoly prices rather than merely [...] "reasonable" [...] prices. The Ninth Circuit said when <b>compulsory</b> <b>sales</b> relief was ordered in patent-antitrust cases, the courts ordered the sales to be a [...] "reasonable" [...] prices. In this case, however, it would be sufficient that the prices be nondiscriminatory and therefore the Ninth Circuit modified the district court's injunction order to eliminate the reasonableness requirement.|$|R

United States, 343 U.S, 444 (1951), is a 1951 patent-antitrust {{decision}} of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court upheld a ruling that the dominant U.S. manufacturer of concrete block-making machines violated the antitrust laws when it acquired its two principal competitors (attaining a 65% market share), bought important patents, made bad-faith threats of patent infringement suits, and entered into patent licensing agreements in which the parties were given veto powers over any prospective additional licensees.

50|$|The Panel and Appellate Body in Tuna-Dolphin GATT Case (I and II) {{held that}} the US {{labeling}} measures for dolphin-safe tuna was a technical regulation. The requirements were not <b>compulsory</b> for the <b>sale</b> of tuna in the US, however the requirements were compulsory for dolphin-safe certification. The Appellate Body stated that because the US provided no other methods of obtaining the dolphin-safe label, the requirement was binding, and therefore de jure mandatory. It appears from this decision that measures that attempt to obtain a monopoly over a specific label will be deemed technical regulations, but the test is ultimately on a case-by-case basis.|$|R
50|$|The {{relations}} between the state inspectors of factories and the ordinary police authorities are regulated in each state by its constitution. Prohibitions of truck in its original sense - that is, payment of wages otherwise than in current coin - apply to any persons under a contract of service with an employer for a specified time for industrial purposes; members of a family working for a parent or husband are not included; outworkers are covered. Control of fines and deductions from wages applies only in factory industries and shops employing at least 20 workers. Shop hours are regulated by requiring shops to be closed generally between 9 P.M. and 5 A.M., by requiring a fixed midday rest of t 2 hours and at least 10 hours' rest in the 24 for assistants. These limits can be modified by administrativeauthority. Notice of hours and working rules must be affixed. During the hours of <b>compulsory</b> closing <b>sale</b> of goods on the streets or {{from house to house}} is forbidden. Under the Commercial Code, as under the Civil Code, every employer is bound to adopt every possible measure for maintaining the safety, health and good conduct of his employees.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the issues of {{increasing}} the efficiency of insurance companies {{on the basis of}} using new non-traditional distribution channels. The relevance of the topic is justified by the automation of management processes, a new generation of consumers focused on new technologies, the use of the Internet, growing and selling functional mobile gadgets. The insurance companies use new distribution channels via the Internet network along with the traditional means for the expansion of the insurance portfolio and attracting active and passive consumers. The calculations carried out {{on the basis of the}} data of the Bank of Russia show that the share of such sales is growing, but not leading. The use of the Internet depends on many factors, but primarily on the types of insurance. The authors carry out calculations on the use of distribution channels in various types of insurance. The complexity and variety of products on life insurance requires qualified intermediaries, therefore, the use of new distribution channels here is not widespread in contrast to classical accident insurance or <b>compulsory</b> insurance, where <b>sales</b> are more efficient when organizing through the Internet. Selling through Internet has a number of advantages that reduce the cost of doing business, reduce the agency network, the cost of print advertising to attract passive and strengthen the relationship with active consumers. The authors also conduct analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of using mobile gadgets to work with potential customers, quantitative and qualitative benefits of implementing mobile apps in the work of insurance companies. The conclusions are made about the complexity of calculation of economic efficiency of implementing mobile applications. The possible directions of increasing the efficiency of using new distribution channels by insurance companies are defined...|$|R

50|$|In the 21st century, {{land reform}} in Scotland {{has focused on}} the {{abolition}} and modernisation of Scotland's antiquated feudal land tenure system, security of tenure for crofters and decentralisation of Scotland's highly concentrated private land ownership. Scotland's land reform is distinct from other contemporary land reforms in its focus on community land ownership, with the Land Reform (Scotland) Acts of 2003 and 2016 establishing the Community Right to Buy, allowing rural and urban communities first right of refusal to purchase local land when it comes up for sale. Crofting communities are granted a similar Right to Buy though they do not require a willing seller to buy out local crofting land. Under the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015 and Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016, Scottish ministers can grant a <b>compulsory</b> <b>sale</b> order for vacant or derelict private land or land which, if owned by the local community, could further sustainable development.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{important}} functions of the Lands Tribunal is to adjudicate claims by landlords for possession of premises, the tenancies or sub-tenancies of which are under the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7). Starting from 9 July 2004, the Tribunal also has power to adjudicate claims for possession of premises, the tenancies or sub-tenancies of which have expired by effluxion of time {{even when they are}} outside the said Ordinance. The Tribunal also has power to grant consequential relief. Another widely used jurisdiction of this Tribunal is to determine building management disputes. Such disputes arise from, among others, the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) and deeds of mutual covenant, the appointment or dissolution of management committees, requisitions for owners' meetings and appointment of building management agent. The Tribunal also has unlimited jurisdiction to determine the amount of compensation payable by the Government to a person whose land has been compulsorily resumed or has suffered a reduction in value because of public developments. The Tribunal can also order the sale of land for redevelopment purpose under the Land (<b>Compulsory</b> <b>Sale</b> for Redevelopment) Ordinance (Cap. 545). The Tribunal also exercises appellate jurisdiction over (i) determinations by the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation under the Rating Ordinance (Cap. 116); (ii) determinations by the Director of Lands under the Government Rent (Assessment and Collection) Ordinance (Cap. 515); and (iii) determinations by the Director of Housing under the Housing Ordinance (Cap. 283). In exercising its jurisdiction, the Tribunal has the same powers to grant remedies and relief, legal or equitable, as the Court of First Instance of the High Court. Parties may appoint counsel or solicitors to appear before the Tribunal or, as is often the case, they may appear in person. The tribunal has a President who is a Judge of the Court of First Instance. There are currently two Presiding Officers who are District Judges, and three members.|$|E

40|$|Notwithstanding that a Royal Commission is {{now sitting}} to examine into the working of this measure, {{it may be}} useful for the purpose of drawing forth public opinion, that our society should discuss some of the {{questions}} which its operations have raised. The acquisition of the land by the occupier has now been removed out of party debate, as all sides desire its accomplishment. The fundamental idea in Lord Ashbourne 2 ̆ 7 s Act appears to be voluntary sale and voluntary purchase. A landlord under it is not to be compelled to sell unless he likes, and at whatever price he likes; and similarly, a tenant cannot be compelled to purchase, unless he thinks it is his interest to do so, The Act is at present the best available machinery for carrying out sales to tenants by loans from the government; and I propose to touch upon some points in which the Act might possibly be usefully amended, without changing its essential principle of voluntary sale, unless my proposal for the <b>compulsory</b> <b>sale</b> of head-rents and incumbrances may be regarded as a departure from it...|$|E
40|$|Maijala on väitöskirjassaan tutkinut 1930 -luvun talouspulan vaikutusta suomalaiseen maaseutuyhteisöön sekä yhteisön selviytymistä kohtaamastaan taloudellisesta kriisistä. Kriisin syntyyn vaikutti vanhakantaisen maaseutuyhteisön perinteisten toimintamallien yhteentörmäys modernisoituvan yhteiskunnan kanssa. Murros johti talonpoikasen väestön monimuotoiseen vastarintaan, ja kriisistä selviytyminen vaati ennen kaikkea kykyä sopeutua muutokseen. Vaikka Maijalan tutkimuksen kohteena on Kalajokilaakso ja siellä erityisesti Reisjärvi, väitöskirjan tarkoituksena ei ole tutkia yksittäistä kohdetta. Tutkimuksen kohteena on prosessi, jonka tutkiminen Kalajokilaaksossa oli mahdollista. This study {{describes}} {{the effects of}} the 1930 s economic recession on the Finnish agricultural society, and how it survived the economic crisis it confronted. The study includes the compulsory sales in the Reisjärvi parish and elsewhere in the basin of the Kalajoki-river during the depression of the 1930 s. Between 1929 and 1936, 504 farms were put up for <b>compulsory</b> <b>sale</b> in the Kalajoki-river basin. This was 10 per cent of all the farms. Although compulsory sales took place in all the parishes of the area, there were notable differences between the districts. The overall picture of a farm in financial difficulties is unravelled by analyzing the material. In addition to crisis in community, {{the effects of the}} depression on an individual are shown with a few examples. Despite the local nature of the examples, they {{can be seen as a}} general picture of an individual’s distress caused by the depression. In the basin of Kalajoki-river the compulsory sales were a problem for the middle-sized and relatively large commercialised farms. The compulsory sales clearly focused on the farms, which had over 15 hectares of arable land. Farms with over 25 hectares were relatively sold the most. The bitterness of the small farmers, who were not able to pay their debts, was shown in many ways. The most visible form of the bitterness was a stir, which received nation-wide attention. Both individual and communal – passive and active – resistance existed in local terms as well, even though they did not receive as much attention. The most effective way to help the farmers in financial difficulties was to redeem a sold farm to the state and return it back to its former owner. In the basin of the Kalajoki-river 43 per cent of the sold farms were redeemed by the state. As a general rule, this system could be seen as a certain state loan, since nine out of ten farms were returned back either to the former owner or to his/her relatives. In the basin of the Kalajoki-river the owners of rather large farms had better chances to survive than the small farmers. While 20 - 30 per cent of the farms with less than 10 hectares of arable land were admitted to redemption, the ratio of the larger farms was two or even three times more...|$|E
