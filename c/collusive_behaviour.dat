40|$|This paper studies a mechanism-design problem {{involving}} a principal-supervisor-agent in which collusion between supervisor and agent can only occur {{after they have}} decided {{to participate in the}} mechanism.

A simple example of such a mechanism is one in which the agent bypasses the supervisor and directly contracts with the principal in some states of the world. The result that collusion can be eliminated at no cost in this environment highlights the important assumptions required for collusion to be a salient issue in the existing literature. The result is robust to alternative information structures, <b>collusive</b> <b>behaviours</b> and speci…cation of agent’s types.

In this paper, we focus on gas release, its impact on welfare or consumer surplus and on the optimal level of released quantities set by regulators. We use a Cournot model with capacity constraints in order to study gas release and we put forward two conclusions. First, we compute {{the impact of these}} strategies on consumer surplus and welfare. We show that there is no impact on consumer surplus, but welfare can decrease as gas release can induce raising rival's costs (RRC) or 'self-sabotage' strategies. Then, we demonstrate that the regulator must set released quantities according to the information held on the incumbent's supplies to maximise welfare. Finally, we conclude that the regulator can avoid RRC or self-sabotage strategies by setting gas-released quantities.

40|$|International audienceSome European {{regulators}} {{have decided to}} force competition in their nationalmarkets. They have decided {{to go beyond the}} second directive and apply asymmetric regulation. Gas release programs and market shares constraints are the two asymmetric decisions imposed to incumbents. When a regulator imposes a gas release program to an incumbent, this operator is compelled to release quantities of its long term contracts to its competitor. In this paper, we will focus on gas release and its impact on welfare, consumer surplus and on the level of released quantities set by regulators. The aim of a gas release program is to give access to natural gas to competitors. They become actives on the market and are in competition with the incumbent. These programs are time limited. They only help competitors in expecting the development of hubs or new investments in importation infrastructures. If competitors want to stay active after the program, they may find others supply sources to increase security of supply. The gas release can induce Raising Rival's Costs or "Self-Sabotage" strategies. We use a Cournot model with capacity constraints to answer two questions. First, we will study the impact of these strategies on consumer surplus and welfare. We will show that there are no impact on consumer surplus but the welfare decreases. The gas release program introduces a transfer of profit between competitor and incumbent, reduces welfare because of the increase in costs of supply, but has no impact on total consumed quantities. Then, we will suppose that the regulator is setting released quantities maximising welfare. Gas release price is often based on costs plus a bid or a fixed premium. Quantities are set with a less obvious process. We will demonstrate that the regulator must set released quantities : - that would not be so high if incumbent's supplies are small to avoid Self- Sabotage or RRC strategies; - as a function of incumbent's supplies if they are in intermediate values to avoid strategies seen above and to optimise quantities sold on the market; - at a sufficient level to let the two operators playing their Cournot best reply function.

40|$|Prior to the First World War, public {{pricing policy}} was {{essentially}} of no concern to officials and {{politicians in the}} UK/US. Trade associations performed functions that ran afoul of antitrust laws (Scherer and Ross, 1990). Price-fixing, secret price-shading and other <b>collusive</b> pricing <b>behaviour</b> were subject only to the restraint of trade doctrine, 'interpreted in such a narrow way as to make almost anything legal' (Mitchell, 1978 : 20). This changed rapidly during the two world wars, when severe shortages forced governments to act and regulate prices to stop 'profiteering', prevent wage/price inflation and ensure that the poor could buy their rations. Moreover, under wartime conditions, the pursuit of private interest was perceived as less acceptable and gradual shifts were occurring in political viewpoints on the welfare implications of monopolies (power), admitting the danger of detriment to the consumer. Therefore, official committees were established to investigate the desirability of restraints such as resale price maintenance and tying. Laws were enacted and courts rendered judgements that altered prevailing views {{as to what was}} (socially) desirable in pricing and what was not. As a result, collective price agreements were gradually outlawed and firms were forced to look afresh at their pricing practices. This initiated a whole new body of literature prescribing what businessmen should do in setting prices (e. g. Dean, 1950; McNair and May, 1957; Lawyer, 1963; Abrahams, 1964; Sampsom, 1964; Hinkle, 1965; De Vos and Schomer, 1966; Walker, 1967; Darden, 1968; Oxenfeldt, 1975) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report from}} the Centre for Applied Childhood Studies at the University of Huddersfield in the United Kingdom (UK) and the UK-based Action for Children {{describes}} an action research project study that investigated child sexual abuse across several Caribbean countries. The study, "Perceptions of, Attitudes to, and Opinions on Child Sexual Abuse in the Eastern Caribbean", was carried out across 6 countries - Anguilla, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis - {{in an effort to}} understand how Caribbean people perceive the problem, what behaviours and social conditions contribute to it, what the impact of child sexual abuse is on those most affected, and what views are held about the forms of action that might be needed. With funding from the United Kingdom (UK) Department for International Development (DFID), the study was commissioned by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) /the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) as part of an initiative aimed at reducing sexual violence against children. A mixed-methods approach was used to gather data from 5 stakeholder groups: the general population, professionals in relevant fields, policymakers, survivors of sexual abuse, and parents. About 1, 400 people participated in the study overall. The methods used included: literature reviews: overview of international research; policy and legislative analysis; stakeholder consultation sessions; stakeholder engagement at the regional level; focus group discussions; practice-focused interviews with key informants; policy-focused interviews with key informants; narrative interviews with adult survivors in 3 countries; and a community survey of perceptions, attitudes, and opinions across a representative sample in each country. Results are shared with regard to how participants define childhood and sexual abuse, as well as what the scale of the problem is in the Caribbean region. In brief, the research revealed that there is both heightened awareness of child sexual abuse and, in the perception of the majority of people who participated in the study, recognition that it is a "serious and wide-spread problem in the Caribbean". With regard to communication, specifically, the study suggests that there are particular issues for Caribbean societies that affect the reporting of abuse and that may also add to problems of estimating scale: In small societies, anonymity and confidentiality cannot be assured; the perpetrator may be in a position of power or is likely to know someone who is and may be able to influence the outcome of a report; the procedures for dealing with reports, systems for monitoring abuse, and services to deal with the impact of disclosure are underdeveloped; cultural values about the status of children means that they are not always believed; and poverty and the economic and social reliance of many Caribbean women on men mean that action which may affect the main breadwinner (such as reporting abuse) is often undermined by women themselves. Again highlighting communication-related findings of the survey: several forms of sexual abuse described here take place in an atmosphere of secrecy and are kept hidden. The research revealed evidence of new trends in child sexual abuse and also patterns of abuse. Communication-related trends include: Cell phone pornography was reported as a growing problem among children. Children use the cameras on their cell phones to take sexual images of themselves and their friends and then distribute the images. Also, internet abuse was noted as increasing: There were reports of children being approached by predators through social networking sites. In summary, the study identified interlocking factors that perpetuate abuse as follows: harmful sexual cultures (implicit social sanctioning), males with sexually abusive behaviours, females with complicit <b>behaviours,</b> officials with <b>collusive</b> (condoning) <b>behaviours,</b> lack of awareness of effects and consequences, lack of collective public/professional outrage, ineffective systems for reporting and responding to abuse, patriarchal values which place protecting male status and privilege above protection of the child, and disempowerment of children. Legislation to adequately protect children was generally regarded as ineffective and was seen as being compounded by the failure of the criminal justice system. Respondents pointed to "a severe shortage of skilled persons to intervene and provide therapeutic interventions for victims". Another issue raised by many respondents was the complicity of professionals who are aware of abuse and do not act to report it or to protect the child. Furthermore, while, in theory, children should be able to tell their non-abusing parent about sexual abuse or any adult in a position of authority or trust, the study suggests that most children would not risk disclosing to a parent or other adult - they would most likely tell a friend. Recommendations cited in the report include: 1. Develop a regional (and country-level) strategic plan for building abuse-free childhoods based on a "whole of society approach". 2. Treat child sexual abuse as a public health issue, which would "push the problem higher up the political agenda and would enable governments to access funds from different sources to tackle the problem. " 3. Adopt the "child/family friendly approach to budgeting, social planning and economic development", which advocates making the support of the family and the well-being of children the responsibility of every Ministry; it involves identifying multi-sectoral targets and requires the ring-fencing of budgets to achieve progress. 4. Introduce child-sensitive justice systems for child sexual abuse crimes (e. g., reconsider the approach to mandatory reporting, which requires adequate infrastructure for implementation and monitoring, and "is unlikely to result in the social transformation needed to stop" child sexual abuse). 5. Introduce specific interventions based on evidence of their effectiveness in other contexts that can be adapted for the region and which are not high-resource dependent - e. g., build capacity and infrastructure for child protection. In addition to these recommendations, the report details other suggestions and ideas put forward by research participants and through stakeholder consultations - many of which revolve around behaviour and attitude change...|$|R

40|$|The boom in {{the real}} estate and {{construction}} industry in India saw a sudden and sharp increase in the price of cement, to the extent of a price increment as high as 17 per cent in a single month. This paper is an attempt to use the theories of <b>collusive</b> <b>behaviour</b> to explain this sudden increase. <b>Collusive</b> <b>behaviour</b> of cartel formation refers to the illegal behavior of firms within an industry to explicitly or tacitly collude to regulate their market behavior so as to restrict competition. There is a very thin blurred line of distinction between legitimate cooperation and illegitimate collusion. Cartel members agree on fixing prices, total industry output, market shares, rigging bids, setting common sale agencies, allocating territories, or a combination of these measures to gain supernormal profits. In the process of assessing the cement industry behaviour, the paper analyses characteristics of an ideal cartel detection policy and structural and behavioral cartel detection methods. Parameters studied include the firm concentration index, region-wise production & consumption, capacity utilization, cost to sales ratio, etc. Our analysis clearly demonstrates that the sudden surge in the price of the cement is neither due to the demand-supply mismatch of the cement nor a sudden increment in the cost of producing cement. The contention that the cement industry engaged in illegitimate collusion is further strengthened by observing the recent decline in cement price after the Government announcement to import cement...|$|E
