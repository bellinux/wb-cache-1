25|$|Upon the {{decision}} to {{change the name of}} Shaddongate F.C. to Carlisle United in 1904 the club also changed their shirt colours from gold and navy stripes to blue. In 1907 white shorts were introduced and since then various combinations of blue and white have been used by the club. In 1973 the first shirt to feature a sportswear sponsor was worn by United. Made by Admiral, the shirt was based on an earlier Birmingham <b>City</b> <b>shirt</b> and was the first to feature red detailing. Since then red detailing became a common feature on Carlisle shirts.|$|E
500|$|Cardiff City's most {{significant}} rivalry is with nearby neighbours Swansea City, {{known as the}} South Wales derby, with the two sides having played each other over 100 times in all competitions. Swansea's first ever competitive fixture following their founding in 1912 was against Cardiff in the Southern Football League. In April 2006, relations between Cardiff City supporters and Swansea City supporters were aggravated after Swansea won the Football League Trophy final against Carlisle United at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. During their celebrations, Swansea players Lee Trundle and Alan Tate brandished a Welsh flag with an anti-Cardiff obscenity written on it in. As well as carrying the flag, Trundle was also seen wearing a T-shirt with {{an image of a}} Swansea City player urinating on a Cardiff <b>City</b> <b>shirt.</b> The Football Association of Wales (FAW) said the images paraded at the match, which took place at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on 2 April 2006, were [...] "of an extremely offensive and insulting nature and such behaviour is totally unacceptable". The two players in question were arrested by the Police on suspicion of section four public order offences, fined £2,000, and handed one-match suspensions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{intended}} use of shirts dictates different choices of pattern. For example, country shirts are usually checked, with checks of different size to co-ordinate with tweeds of different pattern, and featuring one, two, or sometimes more colours of check over a light cream or white background. [...] For <b>city</b> <b>shirts,</b> plain or striped designs are more common, most stripes being vertical, while horizontal stripes are a legitimate option. [...] Herringbone patterns are worn informally and casually. Some colours, such as purple or pink, are generally only worn with <b>city</b> <b>shirts.</b> Further, {{the use of}} colour is seasonal, with shades like green being associated more with autumn than summer ones like yellow. Colours and patterns may be chosen for more than simply aesthetic reasons, as trends such as power dressing (first noted in Molloy, Dress for Success [...] ) emphasise the social impact of clothing. For example, a City executive might stereotypically wear strong vertical patterns for meetings to emphasise his authority.|$|R

He made his second debut for York after starting in their 1-0 away defeat to Tranmere Rovers on 3 December 2016; this result saw York drop {{to the bottom of the}} National League table. He started up front alongside fellow debutant Rhys Murphy, and Dave Flett of The Press commented that the pair [...] "played with an intelligence, hunger and confidence so rarely seen from their attacking predecessors in <b>City</b> <b>shirts</b> for several years". Parkin scored the first goal of his second spell with York in the following match, a 3-1 home win over Worcester City in the FA Trophy first round on 10 December 2016, with a 10-yard shot in the 14th minute. He was ever-present for York in his loan spell, signing permanently on 6 January 2017.

5000|$|After 35 {{years of}} working with Match of the Day, Davies's final {{appearance}} on the programme came on 25 September 2004, commentating for a match between Manchester City and Arsenal. After the match, Arsène Wenger paid a tribute to Davies and Kevin Keegan presented Davies with a signed Manchester <b>City</b> <b>shirt.</b> Davies's reason for retiring from football commentary was that {{he felt he was}} not getting enough [...] "big" [...] matches, and was being [...] "downgraded". Indeed, the two-year extension he was being offered on his contract made clear {{that he would not be}} covering any [...] "live" [...] football, and there was no guarantee that he would have any involvement at all with the 2006 World Cup. He felt this unacceptable and declined the offer.|$|E
5000|$|Zabaleta made 32 {{appearances}} in all competitions in the 2016-17 season scoring two goals; against Watford in the Premier League and against Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup.

5|$|In 1935, Hull <b>City's</b> first <b>shirt</b> badge {{mirrored}} the familiar three crowns civic emblem of Kingston-upon-Hull, which was {{displayed on the}} sky blue shirts worn in the 1935–36 season. Following that season, the team went without wearing a badge until 1947, when the club crest depicted a tiger's head in an orange-shaded badge. This was worn up until 1957, when it was changed to just the tiger's head. This was worn for three years, when the shirt again featured no emblem. Then, in 1971, the club returned to showing the tiger's head on the shirt. This was used for four years, until the club's initials of HCAFC were shown for four years. After this, a logo with the tiger's head with the club's name underneath was used from 1979 until 1998. The next logo, which remains the club's current logo, features the tiger's head in an amber shield with the club's name, along with the club's nickname, The Tigers.|$|R

50|$|Benarbia left France in 2001 and {{was signed}} on a free {{transfer}} by Manchester City, whose manager Kevin Keegan {{was familiar with}} him from when he scored two goals for Monaco against Keegan's Newcastle United. He became a firm favourite amongst the supporters as City won the First Division and promotion back to the Premier League, winning the club's {{player of the year}} award and being named in the select side for the Division. He was made captain the following season, although he found the pace of the Premier League harder and was much less influential in his second season. He played his final game in a <b>City</b> <b>shirt</b> in 2003 against FC Barcelona in a game to mark the opening of the City of Manchester Stadium, before announcing his retirement.|$|E
5000|$|Leonard [...] "Lenny" [...] Glover (born 31 January 1944) was a {{flamboyant}} [...] left winger {{who played}} for Charlton Athletic [...] and Leicester City.

Later, he had a spell at Kettering Town, and a spell as joint manager of Harlow Town with Bobby Kellard, and since the 2006 World Cup a hard hitting blog.|$|E
50|$|Woodgate {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} on a pay-as-you-play deal with Stoke City on 11 July 2011, {{with a view of}} a further year on his contract, if he proves his fitness. Following his move to Stoke, Woodgate stated that he wants to get his career back on track. He also revealed that he turned down a number of other contract offers from different clubs. He made his debut in a Stoke <b>City</b> <b>shirt</b> in a pre-season friendly against Aldershot Town, playing for 62 minutes. He made his full debut for Stoke in a 1-0 win over Hajduk Split in the UEFA Europa League he played the full 90 minutes. He then completed his first full 90 in the Premier League for Stoke in a 0-0 draw with Chelsea. Woodgate was left out of Stoke's Europa League squad by manager Tony Pulis who feared a recurrence of Woodgate's injuries if he spent too long travelling.|$|E
50|$|On 19 May, {{the army}} {{launched}} an all-out assault using APCs and breached the Red Shirt barricades, leaving {{at least five}} dead, including Italian freelance photojournalist Fabio Polenghi. Two soldiers were seriously wounded in a grenade attack possibly from an M79. The protest leaders surrendered to police {{in an attempt to}} avoid further bloodshed. The majority of protesters booed at the protest leaders as they declared an end to the protests and did not follow them to surrender to the authorities. Fighting between Red Shirt protestors and the army continued {{in many parts of the}} <b>city.</b> Red <b>Shirt</b> protesters set fire to the Stock Exchange, banks, at least two shopping centres (including Central World at the Red Shirts main protest site), a TV station, and barricades built to keep out the army. The total death toll since 14 May is believed to stand at 52. There were reports of clashes in Thailand's northern provinces after the surrender was announced, resulting in a town hall being burned by Red Shirts in Udon Thani.|$|R
50|$|While {{the home}} shirt {{for the season}} was nothing to write home about - a thankfully-plain if unusually dark-shaded blue shirt with little {{adornment}} after the extravagance of 1990's kit design other than simple Kappa logos lining the shoulders and {{the side of the}} shorts, the away kit would take on a special significance to Manchester City fans. While the luminous yellow and navy blue stripes were peculiar, with the yellow in particular somewhat garish and never having even been worn before by <b>City,</b> the <b>shirt</b> took on a whole new meaning when it was worn for the 1999 Football League Second Division play-off Final. Although this game technically marked the lowest ever league finish in Manchester City's history, instead the incredible circumstances by which City were able to win - having conceded the first two goals of the game in the last ten minutes of normal time, before getting two goals of their own in injury time, and then winning a penalty shoot-out - in fact mark this game as one of the proudest moments of the club's history, with many fans describing the victory as feeling as good as winning a top division title, and probably being more important to the club's long-term future. The kit instantly went from being an average if slightly unusual shirt to being one of the most iconic symbols of the club's history. There have been frequent if uncoordinated calls for the shirt to be brought back as an away kit in a future season, though as yet the design has largely been forgotten by the club's successive kit manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 1995-96 season, Alan Ball became manager and {{immediately}} changed the nature of the side. Despite City's obvious strengths down the flanks, the team was adapted to play through the middle of the park. With no supply line from the wings (City's other winger Nicky Summerbee often playing at right-back), and with the loss through injury of Beagrie and the shocking sale of Walsh, Rösler struggled in this season. Many felt that he and fellow striker Niall Quinn were too similar to play in a system that didn't feed strikers effectively and Rösler clearly became unhappy. Much publicised disagreements with the manager culminated in Rösler being dropped from the side, only to be brought on as a sub in the Manchester derby and immediately score a phenomenal goal. Rösler's goal celebrations saw him running to the bench, shouting at Ball and pointing to his name and squad number {{on the back of his}} <b>shirt.</b> <b>City</b> were relegated to Division One at the end of the campaign, but Rösler opted to stay with the Blues. Despite another difficult campaign, Rösler again finished top scorer and clearly benefited from the return to a 4-4-1-1 formation. After another spell out with injury, Rösler would eventually leave the Blues in May 1998 on a free transfer following relegation to Division Two.|$|R
