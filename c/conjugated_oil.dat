40|$|The on-purpose {{application}} of efficient catalysis {{is essential to}} obtain economically feasible and sustainable chemical processes. Zeolites are well-known catalysts in the petrochemical sector, but they also have an eminent potential for the valorization of other feedstocks such as biomass, which can be a valuable alternative for fossil carbon sources. Their conversion to chemicals, in which (part of) the original functionality is retained, is preferred. Despite the many benefits of zeolite catalysis, the microporous zeolite framework though poses a major challenge. Bulky molecules, such as typically encountered in biomass conversions, likely only reach part of the complete zeolite crystal volume due to restricted access to the small micropores or due to slow molecular transport. A solution to this problem consists in the design of hierarchical zeolites with large mesopores in or between the zeolite crystals, often resulting in an improved catalytic performance. Several synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites have been developed, of which post-synthetic alkaline treatments of commercially available zeolites particularly have a promising potential for large-scale applications. In this respect, an important challenge though is to minimize the loss of zeolitic material obtained due to framework atom leaching. The industrially relevant USY zeolites for instance can be hierarchized by such alkaline treatments. However, their particular sensitivity to alkaline media results in difficulties to controllably form a mesoporous network without drastic amorphization, explaining the current initiatives with costly and unsustainable organic pore-directing agents. In this doctoral research, a new practical and straightforward post-synthetic alkaline treatment is developed for the design of hierarchical USY zeolites, with intrinsic potential for large-scale synthesis. More specific, a weakly alkaline NH 4 OH treatment is applied at mild conditions without the use of organic additives, while avoiding the need for additional ion-exchanges. The specific features of the treatment and the resulting materials have been extensively characterized. Using this NH 4 OH method, small mesopores (2 - 6 nm) are selectively formed in a controlled way, which appear to be well interconnected and largely accessible from the outside of the zeolite crystal. During the pore formation, gradual amorphization takes place, which results in varying ratios between the present micro- and mesopores. Both the treatment time and NH 4 OH concentration have been identified as important parameters to steer the mesopore network formation, whereby also the pore diameter can be tuned. Concurrently, no significant mass loss by leaching of framework atoms occurs, implicating an exceptionally high material yield, while the total pore volume and crystal morphology are being preserved. These findings led to the elucidation of a new pore formation mechanism through an intracrystalline transformation of the zeolite into a new phase. After extensive investigation by advanced NMR experiments, this phase was identified as a denser amorphous hydrated aluminosilicate phase. The combination of these various synthetic and material properties expressly distinguishes the densifying mild alkaline NH 4 OH treatment from conventional leaching methods to synthesize hierarchical USY. The catalytic potential of the novel hierarchical USY zeolites is demonstrated in two conversions of lipidic biomass to useful chemicals: the acid-catalyzed isomerization of α-pinene, and the ruthenium metal-catalyzed conjugation of safflower oil. For the α-pinene isomerization, the enhanced activity and selectivity to primary isomers after a short NH 4 OH treatment is ascribed to shorter microporous diffusion paths {{as a result of the}} introduced mesopores. Its associated partial amorphization hence not necessarily implicate a worse catalytic performance, as the loss of active acid sites can be overcompensated by an increased efficiency of the remaining acid sites. Besides, an enlarged indexed hierarchy factor (IHF) appears not to be a necessary prerequisite to obtain valuable hierarchical zeolites. Promisingly, a quasi-perfect reuse of the optimal shortly NH 4 OH treated catalyst is achieved after thermal regeneration, indicating the intrinsic stability under both the reaction and regeneration conditions. In the conjugation of more bulky triglycerides present in safflower oil, likely a combination of an enlarged amount of accessible active sites and improved mass transport in the mesopores results in the enhanced activity, stability and selectivity to primary isomers. The optimal support for highly dispersed Ru metal sites is prepared by successive alkaline NH 4 OH and acetate treatments, which result in a desired high mesoporosity together with a large pore diameter. Also from these results, it appears that amorphization should not be considered by definition as negative, as the optimal support is still able to highly disperse Ru metal, despite its XRD amorphous character. Eventually, this alkaline treated Ru/USY establishes the first H 2 -free and solventless heterogeneous conjugation process for vegetable oil, which is capable of producing exceptionally high yields of a <b>conjugated</b> <b>oil.</b> nrpages: 143 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|While <b>conjugated</b> {{vegetable}} <b>oils</b> {{are currently}} used as additives in the drying agents of oils and paints, {{they are also}} attractive molecules for making bio-plastics. Moreover, <b>conjugated</b> <b>oils</b> will soon be accepted as nutritional additives for "functional food" products. While current manufacture of <b>conjugated</b> vegetable <b>oils</b> or <b>conjugated</b> linoleic acids (CLAs) uses a homogeneous base as isomerisation catalyst, a heterogeneous alternative is not available today. This contribution presents the direct production of CLAs over Ru supported on different zeolites, varying in topology (ZSM- 5, BETA, Y), Si/Al ratio and counter-cation (H+, Na+, Cs+). Ru/Cs-USY, with a Si/Al ratio of 40, was identified as the most active and selective catalyst for isomerisation of methyl linoleate (cis- 9, cis- 12 (C 18 : 2)) to CLA at 165 degrees C. Interestingly, no hydrogen pre-treatment of the catalyst or addition of hydrogen donors is required to achieve industrially relevant isomerisation productivities, namely, 0. 7 g of CLA per litre of solvent per minute. Moreover, the biologically most active CLA isomers, namely, cis- 9,trans- 11, trans- 10,cis- 12 and trans- 9,trans- 11, were the main products, especially at low catalyst concentrations. Ex situ physicochemical characterisation with CO chemisorption, extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements, transmission electron microscopy analysis, and temperature-programmed oxidation reveals the presence of highly dispersed RuO 2 species in Ru/Cs-USY(40). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of {{drying oil}} containing non-conjugated (linseed <b>oil)</b> and <b>conjugated</b> (tung <b>oil)</b> double bonds catalyzed by Co(II) - 2 -ethylhexanoate (Co-EH) is investigated. There is distinctive {{difference in the}} oxidation mechanism between the two model oils. For the non-conjugated linseed oil, H-abstraction occurs via the most susceptible double allylic H atom. A large amount of oxygen is taken up, leading {{to the formation of}} hydroperoxides; the hydroperoxides are then decomposed into alkoxy and peroxy free radicals, followed by the formation of cross-links and byproducts. In contrast, for the mainly <b>conjugated</b> tung <b>oil,</b> the oxidation has to start with H-abstraction from the monoallylic position. In comparison with linseed oil, a lower amount of oxygen is consumed, and much less hydroperoxides and byproducts are formed. It indicates that, once free radicals are formed, they tend to directly add to a conjugated double bond, instead of abstracting a monoallylic H atom. A tentative explanation is given in terms of bond dissociation energy of related bonds...|$|R
40|$|The {{reactive}} double {{bonds in}} <b>conjugated</b> vegetable <b>oils</b> are of high interest in industry. Traditionally, <b>conjugated</b> vegetable <b>oils</b> {{are added to}} paints, varnishes, and inks to improve their drying properties, while recently there is an increased interest in their use {{in the production of}} bioplastics. Besides the industrial applications, also food manufactures are interested in <b>conjugated</b> vegetable <b>oils</b> due to their various positive health effects. While the isomer type is less important for their industrial purposes, the beneficial health effects are mainly associated with the c 9,t 11, t 10,c 12 and t 9,t 11 CLA isomers. The production of CLA-enriched oils as additives in functional foods thus requires a high CLA isomer selectivity. Currently, CLAs are produced by conjugation of oils high in linoleic acid, for example soybean and safflower oil, using homogeneous bases. Although high CLA productivities and very high isomer selectivities are obtained, this process faces many ecological drawbacks. Moreover, CLA-enriched oils can not be produced directly with the homogeneous bases. Literature reports describe many catalytic processes to conjugate linoleic acid, linoleic acid methyl ester, and vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid: biocatalysts, for example enzymes and cells; metal catalysts, for example homogeneous metal complexes and heterogeneous catalysts; and photocatalysts. This Review discusses state-of-the-art catalytic processes in comparison with some new catalytic production routes. For each category of catalytic process, the CLA productivities and the CLA isomer selectivity are compared. Heterogeneous catalysis seems the most attractive approach for CLA production due to its easy recovery process, provided that the competing hydrogenation reaction is limited and the CLA production rate competes with the current homogeneous base catalysis. The most important criteria to obtain high CLA productivity and isomer selectivity are (1) absence of a hydrogen donor, (2) absence of catalyst acidity, (3) high metal dispersion, and (4) highly accessible pore architecture. status: publishe...|$|R

Sustainable polymers can overcome {{the limitations of}} petroleum sourced materials due to their renewable feedstocks, biodegradability, recyclability, and nontoxic nature. The renewably sourced polymer polylactide is commercially produced, but its use is limited by its brittle nature. Consequently, reactive melt blends of end-functionalized polylactide and renewably sourced <b>conjugated</b> soybean <b>oil</b> were investigated. End-functionalized polylactide and <b>conjugated</b> soybean <b>oil</b> reacted in the melt to produce compatibilizers that reduced the droplet diameter, yielding blended materials with improved elongation to break over the parent polylactide homopolymer. Additionally, polyisoprene, a potentially sustainable polymer, was investigated as a macroinitiator for tough polylactide graft polymers. Two methods were investigated to synthesize the polyisoprene macroinitiator: post-polymerization functionalization and isoprene copolymerization with a hydroxyl functionalized monomer. To this end, Conjugated polyisoprene was synthesized by a ruthenium hydride catalyst post-polymerization and subsequently functionalized with a hydroxyl containing maleimide through a facile Diels-Alder reaction. The post-polymerization functionalized conjugated polyisoprene produced well defined polylactide graft copolymers. Furthermore, the hydroxyl containing monomer 2 -methylenebut- 3 -en- 1 -ol was copolymerized with isoprene in both reversible addition-fragmentation transfer controlled radical and emulsion polymerization schemes.

The genus Ranunculus, a representative of the Ranunculaceae family, has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antiviral, antibacterial, antiparasitic and antifungal activities, possibly due to the presence of anemonin and other. Different studies have shown the occurrence of unusual fatty acids (FAs) in Ranunculaceae; however, their therapeutic role has not been investigated. The {{purpose of this study is}} to characterize potential anti-inflammatory bioactivities in Ranunculus constantinopolitanus D 2 ̆ 7 Urv., traditionally used in Eastern Mediterranean folk medicine. Methods The aerial part of R. constantinopolitanus was subjected to methanol (MeOH) extraction and solvent fractionation. The bioactive fraction (I. 2) was further fractionated using column chromatography, and the biologically active subfraction (Y 2 + 3) was identified using infrared (IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The effects of I. 2 and Y 2 + 3 on cell viability were studied in mouse mammary epithelial SCp 2 cells using trypan blue exclusion method. To study the anti-inflammatory activities of I. 2 and Y 2 + 3, their ability to reduce interleukin (IL) - 6 levels was assessed in endotoxin (ET) -stimulated SCp 2 cells using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, the ability of Y 2 + 3 to reduce cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 expression was studied in IL- 1 -treated mouse intestinal epithelial Mode-K cells via western blotting. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK), Tukey HSD, two-sample t-test and Dunnett t-tests for multiple comparisons. Results The chloroform fraction (I. 2) derived from crude MeOH extract of the plant, in addition to Y 2 + 3, a FA mix isolated from this fraction and containing palmitic acid, C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 1 isomers and stearic acid (1 : 5 : 8 : 1 ratio), reduced ET-induced IL- 6 levels in SCp 2 cells without affecting cell viability or morphology.

40|$|Polymeric {{materials}} have been prevalent in {{our everyday lives}} {{for quite a long}} time. Most of today's polymeric materials are derived from nonrenewable petroleum-based feedstocks. Instabilities in the regions where petroleum is drilled, along with an increased demand in petroleum, have driven the price of crude oil to record high prices. This, in effect, increases the price of petroleum-based polymeric materials, which has caused a heightened awareness of renewable alternatives for polymeric feedstocks. Cellulose, starch, proteins and natural oils have all been examined as possible polymeric feedstocks. Natural oils are commercially available on a large scale and are relatively cheap. It is projected that the U. S. alone will produce 21 billion pounds of soybean oil in the period 2008 / 2009. Natural oils also have the advantages of inherent biodegradability, low toxicity, high purity and ready availability. Most natural oils possess a triglyceride structure as shown in Figure 1. Most natural oils have a unique distribution of fatty acid side chains, along with varying degrees of unsaturation per triglyceride. Common fatty acid side chains in naturally occurring oils are palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), a 16 carbon fatty acid with no unsaturation; stearic acid (C 18 : 0), an 18 carbon fatty acid with no unsaturation; oleic acid (C 18 : 1), an 18 carbon fatty acid with one double bond; linoleic acid (C 18 : 2), an 18 carbon fatty acid with two double bonds; and linolenic acid (C 18 : 3), an 18 carbon fatty acid with three double bonds. Of course, there are other fatty acids with varying degrees of unsaturation, but their abundance is usually minimal. All of the unsaturated fatty acids mentioned have naturally occurring cis double bonds, which is common for most unsaturated fatty acids. In addition, the afore mentioned fatty acids have the first double bond at the position of carbon 9 (C 9), followed by carbon 12 (C 12), if there are two degrees of unsaturation, then at carbon 15 (C 15), if there are three degrees of unsaturation. In addition, the double bonds are not in conjugation. Table 1 gives the fatty acid make-up of linseed oil. It can be seen that linseed oil has an average of 6. 0 double bonds per triglyceride. Its fatty acid content consists of 5. 4 % palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), 3. 5 % stearic acid (C 18 : 0), 19 % oleic acid (C 18 : 1), 24 % linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) and 47 % linolenic (C 18 : 3). Table 1 also gives the fatty acid composition and varying degrees of unsaturation for various other naturally-occurring natural vegetable oils. The regions of unsaturation in natural oils allow for interesting polymer chemistry to take place. Some of this interesting polymer science, however, involves chemical modification of the regions of unsaturation. Acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) is prepared by epoxidation of the double bonds, followed by ring opening with acrylic acid. The resulting oil has both acrylate groups and hydroxyl groups. Wool and colleagues have further reacted the hydroxyl groups within the oil with maleic anhydride to produce maleated acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (MAESO). The MAESO has been copolymerized with styrene free radically to produce promising thermosetting sheet molding resins. Petrovi? and co-workers have directly ring opened the epoxidized oil to produce polyols that produce promising polyurethanes through condensation polymerization with diisocyanates. Our group's work initially focused on direct cationic copolymerization of the double bonds or conjugated double bonds of natural oils with monomers, such as styrene and divinylbenzene, to produce promising thermosetting resins. The only modification of the oils that was carried out in these studies was conjugation of the double bonds to enhance the reactivity of the oil. This work has been expanded recently with the incorporation of glass fiber to produce promising composites. We have also explored thermal polymerization techniques to make novel thermosets. This dissertation is divided into four chapters. The first chapter discusses the synthesis and characterization of biobased thermosets prepared by the free radical polymerization of <b>conjugated</b> linseed <b>oil</b> with commercially available monomers. The second chapter covers the synthesis and characterization of a chemically modified castor oil and its copolymerization with cyclooctene via ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP).
