50|$|Common {{plant species}} in the park are Piper aduncum, Trema orientalis, Macaranga species and various orchids. Endangered plants in the park include the matayangan palm (Pholidocarpus ihur), Makassar Ebony, iron wood (Intsia spp.), yellow wood (Arcangelisia flava), and <b>carrion</b> <b>flower</b> (Amorphophallus companulatus).|$|E
50|$|This park {{preserves}} badly threatened Cape Flats Sand Fynbos and Swartland Granite Renosterveld vegetation. A diverse {{array of}} orchids, succulents and flowering bulbs are among the over 160 plant species that occur here. Of these, ten occur only within the city of Cape Town and are in serious danger of extinction, including Antimima aristulata, cowslip (Lachenalia aloides), canary yellow vygie (Lampranthus glaucus) and <b>carrion</b> <b>flower</b> (Orbea variegate).The park {{is also home to}} a variety of small mammals, reptiles and amphibians, as well as range of bird species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carrion</b> <b>flowers,</b> {{also known}} as corpse flowers or stinking flowers, are flowers that emit an odor that smells like rotting flesh. <b>Carrion</b> <b>flowers</b> attract mostly {{scavenging}} flies and beetles as pollinators. Some species may trap the insects temporarily to ensure the gathering and transfer of pollen.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Carrion</b> <b>flowers</b> or stinking flowers, any flower that emits an odor {{that smells}} like rotting flesh ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{plants and}} fungi smell like decomposing carrion and attract insects that aid in reproduction. Plants that exhibit this {{behavior}} {{are known as}} <b>carrion</b> <b>flowers.</b> Stinkhorn mushrooms are examples of fungi with this characteristic.|$|R
5000|$|Due to its odor, {{which is}} like the smell of a rotting corpse or carcass, the titan arum is {{characterized}} as a <b>carrion</b> <b>flower,</b> and {{is also known as}} the corpse flower, or corpse plant (bunga bangkai [...] - [...] bunga means flower, while bangkai can be translated as corpse, cadaver, or carrion). For the same reason, the title corpse flower is also attributed to the genus Rafflesia which, like the titan arum, grows in the rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia, and Malaysian Borneo in Sabah and Sarawak.|$|E
5000|$|A Tour in {{the middle}} of the fruit garden is {{supported}} by various types of rides that bring visitors close to the nature. Facilities include, a recreation Lake/Water park of 25 hectares, Baby Zoo, Deer Leopard, Garden Center, Greenhouse Melon, Coconut Outbound, <b>Carrion</b> <b>Flower,</b> Kids Fun Valley, observation tower, Waterfall Building, Pongo show,Three dimensional trick art museum and House of Hobbit.Theater of Science with Professor Durio is a educational science show with the theme of fruit and food in the theater. [...] The park was closed for renovation and opened again in February, 2014.|$|E
50|$|Thermogenic {{plants are}} found {{in a variety of}} families, but Araceae in {{particular}} contains many such species. Examples from this family include the eastern skunk cabbage, the dead-horse arum, the elephant yam and Philodendron selloum, also known as elephant ear. Contrary to popular belief, the western skunk cabbage, a close relative from the Araceae family is not thermogenic. The <b>carrion</b> <b>flower</b> (Amorphophallus titanum) also uses thermogenically created water vapor to disperse its scent - that of rotting meat - above the cold air that settles over it at night in its natural habitat.|$|E
50|$|The {{plants in}} Smilax, are called <b>carrion</b> <b>flowers</b> for their malodorous flowers and those plants {{included}} in section Nemexia also have flowers that smell like rotten meat. The herbaceous species have greenish-yellow flowers and bloom in spring, they are fly pollinated.|$|R
50|$|In North America, the {{herbaceous}} vines of {{the genus}} Smilax are known as <b>carrion</b> <b>flowers.</b> These plants have a cluster of small greenish flowers. The most familiar member of this groups is Smilax herbacea. These plants are sometimes placed in the genus Nemexia.|$|R
50|$|The hairy, oddly {{textured}} and coloured {{appearance of}} many Stapelia flowers has been claimed to resemble that of rotting meat, and this, coupled with their odour, {{has earned the}} most commonly grown members of the Stapelia genus the common name of <b>carrion</b> <b>flowers.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} many wild edible plant stems. In North America, {{these include the}} shoots of common milkweed, Solomon's seal, wood sorrel (usually eaten with the leaves), {{blackberry}} and raspberry (peeled), chickweeds, galinsoga, common purslane, Japanese knotweed, saxifrage, cleavers, wild leeks, wild onion, nodding onion, field garlic, wild garlic, winter cress and other wild mustards, thistles (de-thorned), stinging nettles and wood nettles (cooked), burdock, bellworts, jewelweed, spiderwort, violets, <b>carrion</b> <b>flower,</b> twisted-stalk, amaranth, pine and slippery elm, among many others. Also, some wild plants with edible rhizomes (underground, horizontal stems) can be found, such as cattail, ground nut, Solomon's seal and false Solomon's seal. Wild edible tubers include arrowhead, and many more. Wild edible stems, like their domestic relatives, are usually only good when young and growing. Many of these also require preparation (as do many domestic plants, such as the potato), so {{it is wise to}} read up on the plant before experimenting with eating it.|$|E
50|$|The Mazomanie Bottoms {{encompasses}} {{a large area}} of Wisconsin River floodplain forest dissected by old river channels that are dry except during periodic floods. Silver maple, elm, basswood, and ash dominate the forest; other trees include swamp white oak, cottonwood, willow, river birch, and hackberry. Openings in the canopy due to elm mortality have a dense understory of prickly ash, gray dogwood, buckthorn, and young trees. Ridges of sand support oaks, but the slough margins are nearly pure silver maple. Vining plants and lianas are found in abundance: virgin’s bower, wild yam, moonseed, wild cucumber, woodbine, poison ivy, <b>carrion</b> <b>flower,</b> and grape. Sand bars and ephemeral pools along the river add considerable diversity. The forest harbors thousands of migrating birds. Nesting birds include these uncommon species: cerulean (Dendroica cerulea), Kentucky (Oporornis formosus), prothonotary (Protontaria citrea) and mourning warblers, winter wren, and brown creeper. The site has a large woodpecker population and is used in winter by bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). Mazomanie Bottoms {{is owned by the}} DNR and was designated a State Natural Area in 1978. Seasonal changes shape the river, thereby altering the beach's size. This along with additional Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) changing land restrictions means the actual beach area changes annually.|$|E
5000|$|The genus Ceropegia {{belongs to}} the {{subfamily}} Asclepiadoideae (milkweeds) within the family Apocynaceae. Species of this genus bear similarities to the <b>carrion</b> <b>flowers</b> or stapelias. There are more than 180 known species and more are being discovered and described regularly. They are distributed throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar to the Arabian Peninsula, southeast Asia, the Canary Islands, the tropical Pacific, and Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{plants in}} the genus Amorphophallus (family Araceae) are known as <b>carrion</b> <b>flowers.</b> Titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum), which has the world's largest {{unbranched}} inflorescence, is also called [...] "carrion flower". Rather than a single flower, the titan arum presents an inflorescence or compound flower composed of a spadix or stalk of small and anatomically reduced male and female flowers, surrounded by a spathe that resembles a single giant petal. This plant has a mechanism to heat up the spadix enhancing the emission of the strong odor of decaying meat to attract its pollinators, carrion-eating beetles and [...] "flesh flies" [...] (family Sarcophagidae). It was first discovered in 1878 in Sumatra.|$|R
50|$|Some flowers have patterns, called nectar guides, {{that show}} pollinators {{where to look}} for nectar; they may be visible only under {{ultraviolet}} light, which is visible to bees and some other insects. Flowers also attract pollinators by scent and some of those scents are pleasant to our sense of smell. Not all flower scents are appealing to humans; a number of flowers are pollinated by insects that are attracted to rotten flesh and have flowers that smell like dead animals, often called <b>Carrion</b> <b>flowers,</b> including Rafflesia, the titan arum, and the North American pawpaw (Asimina triloba). Flowers pollinated by night visitors, including bats and moths, are likely to concentrate on scent to attract pollinators and most such flowers are white.|$|R
50|$|Tiliqua rugosa is an {{omnivore}} {{that eat}} snails, insects, <b>carrion,</b> vegetation and <b>flowers.</b> The species was once preyed upon by dingos, Australian pythons such as Morelia spilota, and local peoples; a threat {{is now more}} likely to come from large, introduced feral species, such as foxes and cats.|$|R
6000|$|The last, {{stepping}} forward, {{and turning}} a stern {{look on the}} alarmed pottingar, broke out as follows: [...] "Thou walking skeleton! thou asthmatic gallipot! thou poisoner by profession! if I thought that the puff of vile breath thou hast left could blight for the tenth part of a minute the fair fame of Catharine Glover, I would pound thee, quacksalver! in thine own mortar, and beat up thy wretched <b>carrion</b> with <b>flower</b> of brimstone, the only real medicine in thy booth, to make a salve to rub mangy hounds with!" ...|$|R
50|$|They {{are also}} very {{important}} ecologically because they are decomposers. Blowflies are not only attracted to decomposing hosts but to some plants as well. C. loewi and other blowflies have been observed to be attracted to Phallus impudicus, the stinkhorn fungus, which tends to smell like <b>carrion.</b> The Stapelia <b>flower,</b> which smells like carrion and emits heat like that of decomposition, also attracts blowflies. The flower causes females to oviposit (deposit eggs from ovipositor) {{but it does not}} support past the 1st instars. Some other plants do support larvae through full development.|$|R
5000|$|Stapelia grandiflora is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} Stapelia genus. It is {{commonly referred to as}} the <b>carrion</b> plant, starfish <b>flower,</b> or starfish cactus, although it is not related to cacti at all. The name [...] "carrion plant" [...] (due to the odor emitted by the flowers as a technique of attracting flies in areas where other pollinating insects are scarce) can also refer to similar Stapelia species as well as members of related genera, including Stapelia gigantea and Orbea variegata. Stapelia grandiflora sometimes also goes by the name of Stapelia flavirostris.|$|R
5000|$|The genera {{of plants}} within the tribe Stapeliae are all {{to varying degrees}} stem succulents. Many of the species {{resemble}} cacti, though are not closely related, {{as an example of}} convergent evolution. The stems are often angular, mostly four-angled in cross-section, but in some species there are six or more, with some species of Hoodia having more than thirty angles. In size they vary from less than 2.5 cm/1" [...] in length to over 2 m/6" [...] tall. The leaves are in most species reduced to rudiments, sometimes hardened and thorn-like, arranged on bumps or tubercles on the angles. Some species, however, still have recognisable leaves, most notably the Indian species Frerea indica, and some members of Tridentea. Stapeliads are most abundant in warm, dry climates. In Africa, there are two separate regions where Stapeliads have most diversified: northeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Several species are endemic to the small island of Socotra off the Horn of Africa. The Arabian Peninsula, and most specifically the country of Yemen, contain another concentration of species. Several more are found in the drier parts of Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Myanmar. A single species, Caralluma europea is found in Europe, in the very southern part of the Iberian peninsula. Stapeliads are often regarded as a climax group within the family because of their often structurally complex flowers. Certain aspects of these reproductive parts mirror the pollination systems in the Orchid family and represent a case of parallel evolution though both groups are quite unrelated and have developed similar, though not identical means to achieve the ultimate goal of pollination and therefore reproduction. Most stapeliads use flies as pollinators, that are attracted to odours resembling dung or rotting meat, emanating from the flowers. Many of the flowers also bear some physical resemblance to rotting animal carcasses, leading to their popular name of <b>Carrion</b> <b>Flowers.</b> However, not all stapeliads smell bad, or attract flies. Some species use beetles, bees, wasps, butterflies or moths as pollinators. Stapeliad flowers range in size from mere millimetres in species of Echidnopsis and Pseudolithos to those of Stapelia gigantea that can reach 40 cm/16" [...] in diameter, and are some the largest of flowers to be found on any species of succulent.|$|R
40|$|Birds {{are special}} {{to many of}} us, from {{backyard}} feeder-watchers to active birders and duck hunters, {{all the way to}} professional ornithologists and wildlife biologists. They are also inspiring and fascinating for their beauty and song, their ability to live in hostile environments, their long-distance migrations, and for some, their strangeness of appearance or behavior. From a broader perspective, birds provide valuable ecosystem services such as eating insect pests and <b>carrion</b> and pollinating <b>flowers.</b> They also are important indicators of ecosystem health, for the extirpation or extinction of a bird species that is particular about its habitat tells us that its habitat is compromised or gone. Laws regulating hunting, protecting migratory birds from market hunting and feather harvesting, and prohibiting the use of DDT and other toxic chemicals, as well as habitat conservation, have allowed many bird species (bald eagles, peregrine falcons, waterfowl) to rebound from earlier population declines. However, most current problems are caused by the destruction and degradation of habitats. The “U. S. State of Birds Report ” released this spring (2009) reported not only that Hawaiian and ocean birds are at great risk of extinction, but also that many mainland species have declined recently and are of conservation concern. In recent decades, about 60 percent of aridland-, 55 percent of grassland-, and 33 percent of forest-bird species have declined in abundance. Many of these species are longdistanc...|$|R
