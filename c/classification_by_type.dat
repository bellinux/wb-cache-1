We discuss how to analyse price stickiness using such a detailed database and compute a quantitative {{measure of the}} unconditional degree of price rigidity in the Italian economy. The analysis focuses on the monthly frequency of price changes and on the duration of price spells, with a sectoral breakdown {{as well as with}} a <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> <b>type</b> of outlet. Prices are in general found to be rather sticky, remaining unchanged on average for around 10 months; price spells last longer for non-energy industrial goods and services, much less for energy products. Prices are revised more frequently upwards than downwards, while the size of price changes is quite symmetric. Price st ickiness is found to be less marked in large modern stores than in smaller traditional shops. Price changes display considerable synchronisation, in particular in the services sector. The average frequency of price changes and the probability of observing a price change over time and across items are positively related to headline inflation and increases in VAT rates and negatively related to the share of attractive prices. These findings are consistent with the ones reported in similar national studies for other countries of the euro area, which were conducted by the National Central Banks within the Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network. consumer prices, nominal rigidity, frequency of price change...|$|E
40|$|The {{landscape}} for waste collection is ever changing. With constant adjustments in Government, increasing budget restrictions {{and changes in}} Legislation, Local Authorities have to adapt their collection methods to achieve the best recycling rates possible. The focus of their efforts is frequently on the cost; however {{there are many other}} drivers and barriers that they must pay attention to such as legislative compliance. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand the interaction of these drivers and barriers. More specifically, the decision making process that they follow. A long term, consistent decision making process is required to maximise the amount of recyclate they can collect. A study of the decision making methodologies showed that the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was the easiest to understand and implement. By having an understandable methodology, the decision maker(s) have clarity and a solid reasoning for the choice they make. Also, by using a commonly understood software to create a programme meant a clear understanding and ownership of the decision made. Scenarios were created to understand how the criteria interact and affect the choice of waste collection method. The interaction of criteria dependent on the size and type of Local Authorities was examined. Of all the criteria that could be taken in to consideration, Legislative Compliance, Net Running Costs and the Quality of the Recyclate collected were repeatedly the most important. The results gathered from the Case Study Authority were checked against these scenarios and it was found that they performed in the same manner that was expected from their <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> <b>type</b> and size of authority. It was concluded that the decision making process, as a whole and in relation to waste management, was successfully understood.

The time sensitive nature of the process highlighted the difficulty assuring the right decision is made at any given time.

40|$|Historians {{frequently}} make statements which, superficially or fundamentally, {{seem to be}} gross generalizations without obvious foundations. The {{suggestion that}} one of America’s heroes of the twenties, the businessman, became a devil of the thirties struck this author {{as one of those}} generalizations. Since it was impossible to measure "public opinion" on the subject, the study examined the image of businessmen as presented in the periodical press. Businessmen {{are an integral part of}} American society; however, historical writing has tended to favor political and military exploits. The businessman's ability to influence societal decisions and his role as a major functioning and determining element within society require in-depth study. The general hypothesis for the study was based on a perception held by the author. It was assumed that historians had projected an image of businessmen held by the American people which was at a high level prior to the 1929 Stock Market Crash, plunged drastically following the Crash and remained at a low level through 1. 934; in 1935, that image rose through the 1937 recession, when it fell again, and then, as recovery began and foreign war materials orders were filled, the image rose but never reached the level of the pre-Crash period. This assumption of the historical attitude was based on the writing of several historians. The project classified businessmen in several categories: retail, construction, and services; wholesale; chain store and mail order; local, small manufacturing; national, corporate manufacturing; local financial and real estate; national financial, insurance, stock brokerage and Wall Street; extractive industry; and, transportation, communication, power, publishing, and entertainment. The popular press was defined as those periodicals with a circulation greater than 0. 1 percent of the population of the United States (± 125, 000) for at least 6 of the 14 years covered by the study. A random sample of one-sixth of the articles published, regardless of subject matter, was content analyzed for attitudes assigned by the study to the vocabulary pertaining to businessmen. Of 293 businessmen who appeared in magazine articles by name, 21 were selected for specific mention and comparison in the study. The great quantity of data was subjected to computer programs to determine precise and systematic measurement. The results indicated that the popular press did not reflect the variations in image suggested by historians. Indeed, the numerical image of businessmen in the period represented a very even, medium, or neutral, position. Mean attitudes toward businessmen for the five periods of the study were clustered around the mean attitude for the entire study (3. 31973 on a scale of 1 to 5), and in only two periods did the numerical image differ significantly from the mean for the entire study. The wide variations suggested by historians did not develop when businessmen were in the twenties as a hero and that he fell from that position examined by business <b>classification,</b> <b>by</b> <b>type</b> of article, or by the magazines' subject/interest areas. Finally, the suggested variations did not emerge from examination of individual periodicals or examination of individual businessmen. The study, then, throws into doubt conclusions reached by many historians that the businessman was regarded by many citizens into disrepute during the thirties. Further study of other periodicals and other sources will be required. Thesis (Ph. D. ...|$|E
40|$|Micro-hydropower plants (MHP) {{give the}} best {{solution}} to the power needs of rural and small communities which serve as decentralized power source to meet the local population requirement. Energy requirements for lighting, cooking, heating, drying, agro-processing and other small scale industrial activities can be met through these MHPs in the most reliable way {{in the rural areas}} of the country like Nepal. Cross- flow turbines are used widely in such MHPs due to their simple design, easier maintenance, low initial investment and modest efficiency. Also, because of their suitability under low heads, their efficient operation under a wide range of flow variations and ease of fabrication, cross- flow turbines have been extensively employed. 	The research work comprises of both experimental studies and numerical investigation of the cross- flow turbine. Experiments are conducted in dedicated test rig available in Fluid Engineering Laboratory of Korea Maritime and Ocean University (KMOU). With robust computer technologies and design developments, a CFD based study on the design, performance characteristics, flow analyses and design optimization are carried out in this study work. A previously made test rig (Hyosung Ebara Engineering Company, South Korea, 2009) was reviewed and maintained to conduct the experiments. 	During the experiment, pump provides the required head and the flow through the turbine. Electro-magnetic flow meter and pressure transducer at the upstream side are used for the flow rate and pressure measurement respectively. The turbine was coupled to powder brake through torque meter and the required parameters were recorded in the data logger. Experiments were conducted at various rpm and flow rates. For numerical simulation, two phase (air & water at 25 째C) steady state with SST turbulence model was selected in the commercial CFD code ANSYS CFX 13. 0. The design parameters include 10 m head, 0. 1 m 3 /s flow rate and 642 rotational speed. Numerical results obtained from the simulation were compared with the experimental results. Several major parameters that affect the cross-flow turbine efficiency were studied and design modifications were done to enhance the turbine performance. 	In order to enhance the efficiency of the turbine, various design modifications have been proposed and evaluated numerically. Nozzle shape modification, guide vane angle variation, blade numbers variation, air layer insertion, casing length and diffuse angle variation were done simultaneously during the process and finally the optimized design was proposed. Velocity distribution, pressure contours, output torque etc. in the flow domain and the several stages of flow inside the runner were also characterized.

In this article, we present {{a description of a}} classification of cell therapies {{on the basis of their}} underlying technologies rather than the more commonly used <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> cell <b>type</b> because the regulatory path and manufacturing solutions are often similar within a technology area due to the nature of the methods used. We analyse the progress of new cell therapies towards clinical translation, examine how they are addressing the clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and reimbursement requirements, describe some of the remaining challenges and provide perspectives on how the field may progress for the future.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{differences}} of morphological galaxy classification between non-experts and experts. The non-experts {{are represented by}} college students and a retired adult community, who use an online application to visually classify galaxies selected from a galaxy morphology catalog. We find that the non-expert group lags the expert <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> one Hubble <b>type</b> behind, for instance, the non-experts classify a set of galaxies with Sb, while the experts classify the same set as Sc. We believe the reason is because the Hubble sequence is increasing the asymmetric structures towards later types. Our {{results show that the}} experts have the ability to identify more detailed structures, which the laymen commonly do not recognize...|$|R
