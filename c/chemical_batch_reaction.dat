An {{application of the}} on-line monitoring of a <b>chemical</b> <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> using UV-visible spectroscopy is discussed in detail. Successful historical batches are used to build a statistical model of the batch reaction. The model uses external information such as the pure spectra of the compounds and their concentration profiles to improve the interpretability. Control charts are developed for on-line monitoring of new batches. It is shown that this model is capable of detecting erroneous batches. In combination with contribution plots, the actual cause of the disturbances can be diagnose...|$|E
40|$|In both {{analytical}} and process chemistry, one common {{aim is to}} build models describing measured data. In cases where additional information about the chemical system is available, this {{can be incorporated into}} the model with the aim of improving model fit and interpretability. A model which consists of a 'hard' or 'white' part describing known sources of variation and a 'soft' or' black' part describing unknown sources of variation is called a 'grey' model. In this paper the use of a grey model is demonstrated using data from a first-order <b>chemical</b> <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy. The resultant three-way data matrix is modelled using a Tucker 3 structure, and external information about the spectroscopically active compounds is incorporated in the form of constraints on the model parameters with additional restrictions on the Tucker 3 core matrix. The grey model is then used to analyse new batches. Different approaches to building grey models are described and some of their properties discussed. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Lt...|$|E

Esterification in a batch reactor (molar ratio of 1 : 8 (acid:EtOH)) {{resulted in the}} isolation of the enantiomerically enriched product (eep= 81 percent and substrate (ees= 93 percent) In order to integrate reaction and separation, liquid-vapour equilibria calculations were performed showing that an excess of ethanol results in a very low ester fraction in the vapour phase. Since this is undesirable for an integrated process of reaction and product removal, a repeated <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> was performed using a molar ratio of 10 : 1 (acid:EtOH). After six cycles (45 percent conversion) the ee of 4 -methyloctanoic acid ethyl ester turned out to be 80 percent. For different E values the eep was calculated for batch and repeated <b>batch</b> <b>reactions.</b> It was shown that in all cases the eep was higher for the repeated <b>batch</b> <b>reaction.</b> However, the product is not enantiopure since the E value of the reaction is rather low at the low ethanol concentration used. An alternative approach would be the continuous separation of the product during the reaction. A mathematical model was developed to describe esterification in a packed bed reactor integrated with product separation. This model shows that integration of reaction and product removal in advance is not suitable either to obtain an enantiomerically pure product. Since the optimal reaction conditions (high ethanol concentration) and the optimal separation system (low ethanol concentration) do not match in this reaction, the preference is given to the <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> at high ethanol concentrations because in that case the highest enantioselectivity of the enzyme is obtained...|$|R

40|$|Prediction {{accuracy}} and model interpretation are two important aspects {{with regard to}} regression models. In the field of statistical modeling of <b>chemical</b> <b>batch</b> processes, most research focuses on prediction accuracy, while {{the importance of the}} latter aspect is often overlooked. In multiphase batch processes, it is possible that only a few phases are relevant to certain quality indices, while different time points belonging to the same relevant phase usually have similar contribution to the quality. The regression coefficients of batch process model should reflect such process characteristics, that is, the coefficients corresponding to the irrelevant phases should be close to zero, while the coefficients of each variable within the same phase should vary smoothly. In this study, regularization techniques are introduced to statistical modeling of <b>chemical</b> <b>batch</b> processes to achieve both accurate prediction and good interpretation.

30|$|Isonicotinic acid (INA) is an {{important}} pyridine derivative used {{in the manufacture of}} isoniazid (antituberculosatic drug) and other pharmaceutically important drugs. Nitrilase catalysed processes for the synthesis of pharmaceutically important acids from their corresponding nitriles are promising alternative over the cumbersome, hazardous, and energy demanding chemical processes. Nitrilase of Nocardia globerula NHB- 2 (NitNHB 2) is expressed in presence of isobutyronitrile in the growth medium (1.0 % glucose, 0.5 % peptone, 0.3 % beef extract, and 0.1 % yeast extract, pH 7.5). NitNHB 2 hydrolyses 4 -cyanopyridine (4 -CP) to INA without accumulation of isonicotinamide, which is common in the reaction catalysed via fungal nitrilases. The NitNHB 2 suffers from substrate inhibition effect and hydrolysing activity up to 250 mM 4 -CP was recorded. Complete conversion of 200 mM 4 -CP to INA was achieved in 40 min using resting cell concentration corresponding to 10 U mL- 1 nitrilase activity in the reaction. Substrate inhibition effect in the fed <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> (200 mM substrate feed/ 40 min) led to formation of only 729 mM INA. In a fed <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> (100 mM 4 -CP/ 20 min), substrate inhibition effect was encountered after 7 th feed and a total of 958 mM INA was produced in 400 min. The fed <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> scaled up to 1 L and 100 % hydrolysis of 700 mM of 4 -CP to INA at 35 °C achieved in 140 min. The rate of INA production was 21.1 g h- 1 mgDCW- 1. This is the fastest biotransformation process ever reported for INA production with time and space productivity of 36 g L- 1 h- 1 using a bacterial nitrilase.|$|R
30|$|The {{variation}} in the batches indicates that the electrical conductivity generally decreases after the <b>batch</b> <b>reactions.</b> It shows increasing trend in batch 8 and 11. This {{may be due to}} the regeneration process during the flow of water and saturation of the available exchange sites. Though bicarbonate concentration shows fluctuation but generally exhibit a decreasing trend except in batch 8, where both the HCO 3 and EC shows increasing trend.|$|R
50|$|Another green {{approach}} is a modification to the Turkevich citrate reduction making use of flow chemistry, reported by Bayazit et al. Flow chemistry is an appealing replacement for many heated <b>batch</b> <b>reactions.</b> By exposing more surface area of {{the reaction to the}} heating element, flow reactors heat a reaction faster and more evenly than a batch reactor can, promoting rapid nucleation and smaller particle sizes with higher monodispersity.|$|R
