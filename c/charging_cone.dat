40|$|Abstract. At long standoff, a shaped <b>charge</b> {{with small}} <b>cone</b> angle {{will produce a}} jet with a high tip {{velocity}} and a low tail velocity, causing it to stretch and break up, so its penetration ability into multilayer metal targets is very weak, while the penetration depth of explosively formed projectiles is too low to penetrate into multilayer metal targets. On account of this, the large <b>cone</b> angle shaped <b>charge,</b> whose internal <b>cone</b> angle is about 100 degree, is proposed and designed in the paper. The sensitivity of penetration effect into targets to the cone angle of the liner is investigated by experiment. The results reveal that the shaped charge penetration into multilayer metal targets with large interval is more optimistic {{than that of the}} shaped <b>charge</b> with small <b>cone</b> angle and explosively formed projectiles. In numerical simulation, based on interface tracking algorithm known as markers on cell line to reconstruct material interfaces, jet penetration into metal targets is simulated in a two-dimensional multi-material Eulerian code. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental ones and also indicate the interface tracking algorithm has much better resolution for moving interfaces, especially effective for large deformation. 1...|$|R

This paper introduces the impact of new design of conical spinneret electrode on the generated electrospun nanofibers. In this work, the conical feeder is used to generate electrospun Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofibers, and being compared to the traditional needle feeder at the same processing conditions. The jet’s mechanism is simulated using discrete bead model along with estimated calculations of both deposition area and fiber radius. The electric field distribution that is around the <b>charged</b> <b>cone</b> is analyzed. Based on both theoretical modeling and experimental measurements, a comparison of mean diameter, deposited area, and the thickness of generated nanofibers is presented related to both conical and needle electrodes. Conical feeder shows clearly compact nanofibers mat in terms of deposition area (spherical deposition of diameter ~ 6 cm) up to half-area of needle deposited nanofibers with high fiber density for the same time of the process. Moreover, the conical electrode is found to have privilege in terms of productivity rate and operation time.

Our current focus is to perform a high-fidelity computational study to investigate micro-shaped charge jet formation and penetration depth.

The results obtained in this paper indicate that there are obvious differences between jetting projectile charge (JPC) and explosively formed projectile (EFP) in penetrating into multi-layer targets.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for 30 years that 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles of charge Q greater than one cannot be spherically symmetric. 5 years ago, Bolognesi conjectured that, {{at some point in their}} moduli space, BPS monopoles can become {{approximately}} spherically symmetric in the high Q limit. In this note we determine the sense in which this conjecture is correct. We consider an SU(2) gauge theory with an adjoint scalar field, and numerically find configurations with Q units of magnetic charge and a mass which is roughly linear in Q, for example in the case Q= 81 we present a configuration whose energy exceeds the BPS bound by about 54 percent. These approximate solutions are constructed by gluing together Q cones, each of which contains a single unit of magnetic <b>charge.</b> In each <b>cone,</b> the energy is largest in the core, and so a constant energy density surface contains Q peaks and thus resembles a sea urchin.

40|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} (ESIMS) {{is widely used}} to characterize neutral and ionic species in solvents. Typically, electrical, thermal, and pneumatic potentials are applied to create electrosprays from which charged ionic species are ejected for downstream analysis by mass spectrometry. Most recently, ESIMS has been exploited to investigate ambient proton transfer reactions at air-water interfaces in real time. We assessed the validity of these experiments via complementary laboratory experiments. Specifically, we characterized the products of two reaction scenarios via ESIMS and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR) : (i) emulsions of pH-adjusted water and isoprene (C 5 H 8) that were mechanically agitated, and (ii) electrosprays of pH-adjusted water that were collided with gas-phase isoprene. Our experiments unambiguously demonstrate that, while isoprene does not oligomerize in emulsions, it does undergo protonation and oligomerization in electrosprays, both with and without pH-adjusted water, confirming that C-C bonds form along myriad high-energy pathways during electrospray ionization. We also compared our experimental results with some quantum mechanics simulations of isoprene molecules interacting with hydronium at different hydration levels (gas versus liquid phase). In agreement with our experiments, the kinetic barriers to protonation and oligomerization of isoprene were inaccessible under ambient conditions. Rather, the gas-phase chemistries during electrospray ionization drove the oligomerization of isoprene. Therefore, we consider that ESIMS could induce artifacts in interfacial reactions. These findings warrant a reassessment of previous reports on tracking chemistries under ambient conditions at liquid-vapor interfaces via ESIMS. Further, we took some high-speed images of electrosprays where {{it was possible to}} observe the main characteristics of the phenomena, i. e. Taylor <b>cone,</b> <b>charge</b> separation, and Coulomb fission. Finally, we took the freedom to speculate on possible mechanisms that take place during electrospray ionization that affected our system and possibly may influence other common analytical techniques on ESIMS...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Ren-Qi Wang, Teng-Teng Ong, Ke Huang, Weihua Tang & Siu-Choon Ng ### Abstract We {{described}} a facile and effective protocol wherein radical copolymerization is employed to covalently bond cationic β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) onto silica particles with extended linkage, {{resulting in a}} chiral stationary phase (IMPCSP) {{that can be used}} for the enantioseparation of racemic drugs in both high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Starting from commercially available chemicals, the IMPCSP is prepared in several steps: (i) reaction of β-CD with 1 -(p-toluenesulfonyl) -imidazole to afford mono- 6 A-(p-toluenesulfonyl) - 6 A-deoxy-β-cyclodextrin (B); (ii) nucleophilic addition between B and 1 -vinylimidazole and followed by treatment with anionic-exchange resin to give mono-vinylimidazolium-CD chloride (C); (iii) electrophilic addition between C and phenyl isocyanate to generate 6 A-(3 -vinylimidazolium) - 6 -deoxyperphenylcarbamate-β-CD chloride (D); (iv) reaction of silica gel with 3 -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane to engender vinylized silica (E); (v) immobilization of C onto vinylized silica via radical copolymerization with 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene in the presence of 2, 2 ’-azobis(2 -methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) to afford the desired chiral stationary phases. The overall IMPCSP preparation and column packing protocol requires ~ 2 weeks. ### Introduction Chromatographic methodologies have been extensively explored for accurate sample analyses, online monitoring of reaction progress and purifying of synthesized products (1). Especially, modern chromatographic techniques have been developed as powerful tools for chiral separation and preparation of enantiomers, most of which are of biological and pharmaceutical interests. Whatever chiral chromatographic techniques are used, chiral selectors either dissolved as mobile phases or mobilized onto supporting materials as stationary phases are crucial for successful and robust enantioseparations. Among the chiral selectors used so far, cyclodextrins (CDs) and their derivatives have been widely used in chiral chromatography since its first introduction by Armstrong et al. (2). In order to obtain a better solubility, the charged moieties are favorably introduced onto CD rims for capillary electrophoresis (CE). The self-mobility of CD in the ionized form enhances the separation ability when it is opposite to the electrophoretic mobility of the analytes (3). The hydrophobic moieties on the analytes could be included or adsorbed into the chiral cavity of CDs. Meanwhile, the analytes could also interact with the substituents on the CD rims (4, 5). The native CDs and their chemically-modified derivatives afford fine-tuned hydrophobicities, <b>charges</b> and <b>cone</b> shapes etc., which ultimately result in different tightness and interactions for CD-analytes complexes selectors and thus chemically-manipulated diving forces for chiral recognitions (6 - 14). The charged CD-based chiral mobile phases and chiral stationary phases (CSPs) have been extensively explored in drug chiral analyses (15 - 20). A sulfated β-CD based CSP was developed which enabled great enantioseparations towards 33 racemic drugs in high-perfomace liquid chromatography (HPLC) 9. Recently, ionic-liquids featured positively-charged CDs have been covalently bonded onto silica gels to prepare novel CSPs, which exhibited dual selectivity in HPLC for the enantioseparation of both polar and non-polar compounds (18). The additional electrostatic interactions are significant to achieve separations of polar analytes which may interact with the neutral CDs too weakly, where 16 aromatic alcohol racemates and 2 drugs were achieved in polar organic mobile phases 19. In our previous report, a series of coated CSPs based on fully derivatized cationic β-CD were prepared. These cationic β-CD CSPs have shown strong enantioseparation abilities and moderate retention times towards a series of α-phenyl alcohols in both supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and HPLC 20. However, polar organic solvents in the mobile phase could cause damage to the coated CSPs. Besides, the efficiencies of the coated CSPs are usually low as the surface thickness of chiral selectors is hard to control (21). Figure- 1 (R Wang) Syntheses of Ts-CD (B), compounds C and D. The immobilization of functionalized CD onto silica gel is generally achieved by chemical reactions between highly reactive substituent on CD and the functional groups on silica gel (14, 16 - 18). Tedious synthetic approaches with possible protecting and de-protecting steps are usually required for successful grafting. Comparatively, the facile co-polymerization method is more accessible and reliable, universally employed in producing non-silica fillings for columns applicable for size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) or ion-exchange applications (22). The polymerized materials used for chromatography have wide applicable pH ranges and improved retentions for polar analytes, although lower mechanic strength and efficiency are often observed than the silica-based CSPs. The co-polymerization approach was also explored in the immobilizing of polysaccharide or enantiopure small molecules onto silica gel for the preparation of CSPs (23, 24). Figure- 2 (R Wang) Preparation of IMPCSP via radical copolymerization. In view of the our continuous and successful research endeavors in developing powerful cationic CDs as chiral selectors for both CE and HPLC (12, 25, 26), we recently developed the facile copolymerization methodology in preparing novel covalently-bonded cationic β-CD CSPs via co-polymerization approach (see Figs. 1 and 2). These as-prepared CSPs have successfully expanded the enatioseparation windows towards a broader range of chromatographic conditions for both HPLC and SFC application (27, 28). The linkage between CD selector and silica-support was built by using diene (ca. 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene) as the third monomer for the dual copolymerization system with vinyllated CD and silica gel. The extended linkage can effectively improve the surface loading issue of CD onto silica gel, a challenge faced when direct immobilizing CD derivatives onto silica surface with short spacers due to steric hindrance (29). The as-developed CDs CSPs exhibited great potential in drug enantioseparations in both HPLC and SFC applications. The protocol describes herein the synthesis of imidazolium-based IMPCSP. This methodology can also be applied for the synthesis of other ammonium-based cationic CD CSPs (27, 28), which may find wide applications for both drug enantioseparations and NOM assessments. ### Reagents 1. β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD; > 95 %; TCI, cat. no.
