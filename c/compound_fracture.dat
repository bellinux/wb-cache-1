5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season {{with a sense of}} optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a defense that led the NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On a Monday Night Football game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a <b>compound</b> <b>fracture</b> of Theismann's right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says he has never seen video of the play and never wants to. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} European Championships, first-choice striker Eduardo, {{who was the}} team's top goalscorer during qualifying, {{suffered}} a <b>compound</b> <b>fracture</b> while playing for Arsenal in the Premier League. Bilić was forced to alter his final Euro 2008 squad significantly and recruited Nikola Kalinić and Nikola Pokrivač, neither of whom had yet played competitive games for the national team. The team received criticism after poor attacking performances in warm-up games against Scotland and Moldova, but at the tournament they beat Austria, Germany and Poland in the group stages to reach the quarter-finals with maximum group points {{for the first time}} in their tournament history. Niko Kovač remained team captain at what was expected to be his final international tournament, except in the final group fixture when Dario Šimić temporarily held the captain's armband. Croatia's campaign ended dramatically when they lost a penalty shoot-out to Turkey, with Luka Modrić, Mladen Petrić and Ivan Rakitić all missing their penalties. Croatia left the tournament with records for fewest goals conceded (2), fewest games lost (0), and earliest goal (in the fourth minute of their opening game against Austria; this was also the all-time earliest successful penalty at the European Championship Finals).|$|E
25|$|The <b>compound</b> <b>fracture</b> of the tibia led to {{insufficient}} bone growth during Theismann's recovery, {{leaving his}} right leg shorter than his left. As a result, the injury forced Theismann into retirement {{at the age of}} 36. Theismann has never blamed Lawrence Taylor for his injury.|$|E

In the case of mandibular fractures, communication may occur through {{the skin of the}} face or with the oral cavity. Mandibular fractures that involve the tooth-bearing portion of the jaw are by definition compound fractures, because there is at least a communication via the periodontal ligament with the oral cavity and with more displaced fractures there may be frank tearing of the gingival and alveolar mucosa.|$|E
25|$|In Afghanistan, a {{helicopter}} carrying Arian and Ernest is hit by Taliban insurgents. Ernest falls out, and Arian jumps after him. Ernest's leg is badly wounded, and he suffers a <b>compound</b> <b>fracture,</b> rendering him immobile as the Taliban arrive. After a drawn-out gunfight, the U.S. soldiers {{run out of}} ammunition. Rather than getting captured, Arian helps Ernest stand up, facing the enemies and turning their empty weapons against them, an action which prompts the Taliban to kill them. The unit commanders attempt a rescue of the downed soldiers, sending A-10 Warthogs, but the weather, time, and distance interfere.|$|E
25|$|Fowler {{had worked}} so hard in {{developing}} his ideas that he had undermined his health. He was advised to take more rest and so he retired to Ackworth in Yorkshire, to recuperate. He was persuaded to take up hunting as a way of getting exercise and whilst out with the hunt he had a fall and sustained a <b>compound</b> <b>fracture</b> of his arm. Whilst recovering from this mishap, he developed tetanus and died on 4 December 1864, at his home in Ackworth. He died only months after his great triumph at the Newcastle ploughing trial, at the age of only thirty-eight.|$|E

25|$|On July 15, Jardine {{and his men}} {{engaged the}} rioters at First Avenue and Nineteenth Street {{supporting}} Major Robinson and the Duryea's Zouaves with artillery fire from two howitzers. While the infantrymen engaged the rioters, Jardine ordered the guns to sweep the avenue but the mob scattered from the street {{by the time he}} gave the order to fire. Within a few minutes, they began taking fire {{from both sides of the}} street. Both artillery and sharpshooters returned fire, neither being effective. Despite being vastly outnumbered, he and his men attempted to disperse the mob but were instead pushed back leaving many soldiers dead and wounded on the streets before being forced to retreat. It was during this battle that Jardine was struck in the thigh by a piece of lead pipe fired from a cannon, which caused a <b>compound</b> <b>fracture,</b> an injury from which he would never fully recover.|$|E
25|$|The feud between Scott Steiner and Sid Vicious {{continued}} {{after the}} event. The following night, Ric Flair, the on-screen president of WCW, announced that Steiner would defend the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in a Three Way match at Sin. Jeff Jarrett won a four-man tournament {{to become one}} of the challengers in the match as Flair kept the identity of the other challenger a mystery. As Jarrett and Steiner planned to work together in the match, Flair added Vicious to the match. Road Warrior Animal was revealed to be the mystery challenger, and Steiner retained the title. The feud, however, came to an end immediately after the event as Sid suffered a severe <b>compound</b> <b>fracture</b> of his left leg during the match after performing a move off the top rope; the injury led to his retirement from full-time competition and he did not wrestle again for three years. Steiner was placed into feuds with Diamond Dallas Page and Kevin Nash over the next two months, defeating Nash at SuperBrawl Revenge and Page at Greed before the company was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He lost his title to Booker T on the last edition of WCW Monday Nitro held eight days after his match with Page.|$|E
25|$|During the 2014 offseason, George {{was named}} to the {{training}} camp roster for the US national team that would represent the country at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain. He had been considered a virtual lock to make the roster. However, on August 1, George landed awkwardly {{at the base of a}} basket stanchion after fouling James Harden during a Las Vegas scrimmage, and suffered a <b>compound</b> <b>fracture</b> of both bones in his lower right leg. After George was carted off the court, head coach Mike Krzyzewski addressed the arena stating the game would not continue out of respect to George and his family. George quickly went into surgery for the fracture, with a pin being inserted in the leg. While no official prognosis was initially given, he was considered likely to miss the entire 2014–15 season. George, who had said he wanted to play at some time during the season, was cleared to put weight on the leg in late September, and was shooting jumpers in practice in late October. He participated in his first full practice of the season on February 26, three days earlier than expected, and was ruled a possibility to play within a week on March 20. On April 5, George made his return to the Pacers line-up for the first time since sustaining his leg injury with Team USA. He scored 13 points in 15 minutes and made two key three-pointers early in the fourth quarter, helping the Pacers defeat the Miami Heat 112–89. He played out the final six games of the season for Indiana, averaging 8.8 points and 3.7 rebounds per game.|$|E
