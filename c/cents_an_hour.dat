Shortly after Mary's birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of Marietta, Georgia. During or after 1907, they again relocated to East Point, Georgia, in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house. Mary Phagan left school at age 10 to work part-time in a textile mill. In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta.

Though these mines were owned by either American or English-Canadian companies, almost all the workers were francophones. The largest company was the American Johns-Manville firm. The union had several demands. These included elimination of asbestos dust {{inside and outside of}} the mill; <b>a</b> fifteen <b>cent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> general wage increase; <b>a</b> five <b>cent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> increase for night work; a social security fund to be administered by the union; the implementation of the Rand Formula; and [...] "double time" [...] payment for work on Sundays and holidays.

25|$|The {{hearings}} {{opened with}} the Steelworkers arguing for a wage and benefit increase estimated between 30 and 50 <b>cents</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> while the employers claimed no increase whatsoever was possible without price relief. ODM director Charles E.

A secret internal memorandum by OPS staff members indicated that the union was actually due a 22-cents-an-hour wage increase, and that the steel companies could absorb up to 40 <b>cents</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> in additional costs without a price hike. But for the union to win a wage increase without giving the employers price relief would appear inequitable and create political problems for both OPS and WSB with Republicans in Congress.|$|E

50|$|The key {{aim of the}} FLU in {{the strike}} was to be {{recognized}} by employers as a bona fide union a wage increase from 40 to 55 <b>cents</b> <b>an</b> <b>hours,</b> which was lauded as preposterous by the growers who argued they should only be paying 30 cents given the supply of labor. Both parties were firm in their beliefs, {{and when it came}} time for proposed mediations, the increasingly frustrated FLU refused. As a result, on 1 September 1934, Joe Carey, an AFL representative, stated that the FLU needed to respect and experienced leadership of the AFL or continue the strike alone. Insulted, the Filipino leaders moved to continue the strike without their recently gained support network. With this return to independence, riots began to unfold.|$|R

It was argued by the Plaintiffs that this was an agreement that was reached in April 1970 and demanded that the wage increase take effect September 6, 1971. The Plaintiffs' second argument was that this act was [...] "unconstitutional and the Executive Order was invalid", because one of the stipulations of the act was that [...] "prices, rent, wages and salaries shall be stabilized for a period of 90-days" [...] as stated by President Nixon.|$|R

50|$|In 1839 Russia was {{the first}} country to pass laws restricting child labor in {{factories}} and setting the number of <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> child could work. Though the reasons behind why these laws were passed were to expand working conditions for adults, it did lead to laws being passed across Europe. In 1839 Britain enacted its Factory Act which restricted child labour and in 1841 France adopted its first child labour laws. After Britain, France and Germany adopted their laws. Almost the entirety of Europe had child labour laws in place by 1890. Although individual states had adopted laws starting with Massachusetts in 1844, the United States did not enact federal laws until the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed in 1938. This law set minimum wages to 40 <b>cent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> restricted the child work week to 40 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> week, and restricted children under 16 from working in manufacturing plants and mining.

2500|$|During Fairless' {{tenure as}} {{president}} of Carnegie-Illinois Steel, his company was unionized. [...] The National Labor Relations Act {{was signed into law}} by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on July 5, 1935. The Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) formed as a caucus within the American Federation of Labor on November 8, 1935. The CIO was intent on organizing all workers in a plant (a philosophy known as industrial unionism), while the AFL supported organizing only highly skilled workers along job lines (known as craft unionism). [...] In order to avoid antagonizing the AFL but eager to begin an organizing drive in steel along industrial union lines, the CIO resolved to work through the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers ("the AA"), a nearly defunct steel union organized along craft lines. Subsequently, the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) was formed in Pittsburgh on June 7, 1936. AFL president William Green was outraged. He denounced what he saw as the takeover of the AA on June 5, and declared that the CIO steelworker organizing drive would fail. More importantly, however, Green interpreted the move as proof that the CIO was engaging in dual unionism. After charges were drawn up and a trial conducted, on September 10, 1936, the AFL suspended the 10 unions which belonged to the CIO—including the AA (which was now operating as part of SWOC) among them. SWOC initially began a heavy organizing drive among steel workers nationwide, employing more than 400 union organizers. But the steel industry responded by almost universally creating [...] "employee representation plans" [...] (ERPs). These ERPs were thinly disguised company unions, and by mid-1935 nearly 90 percent of all workers in the U.S. steel industry belonged to an ERP. U.S. Steel, in particular, saw the ERPs as a legitimate way of learning about employee concerns, and the ERPs in that company began to become more independent. SWOC found little traction in the steel industry, so SWOC focused on gaining control of the ERPs in 1935 and 1936. Fairless was caught in this strategy. [...] In July 1936, he publicly warned his employees against joining [...] "outside unions". So long as the ERPs had not challenged management prerogatives or demanded pay increases, U.S. Steel was content to let them operate, even independently. But in August 1936, the ERP at Carnegie-Illinois demanded <b>a</b> 10 <b>cent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> pay increase, which Fairless personally denied on September 12. Philip Murray, director of SWOC, said Fairless' actions were not discouraging and predicted that his union would soon have enough power in the ERPs to force management to accept a collective bargaining agreement. Murray proved correct: By early November 1936, Fairless had been forced to schedule a meeting for ERP representatives in the Pittsburgh area to discuss <b>a</b> 10 <b>cent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> wage increase. By November 10, Fairless had agreed to a cost of living adjustment for 53,000 of Carnegie-Illinois' 100,000 workers. With SWOC continuing to gain strength in Carnegie-Illinois' ERPs, in early January 1937 Fairless established a grievance committee composed of four pro-union ERP representatives with power to hear and adjudicate employee grievances, including the power to chastise managers and recommend punishment. [...] But this failed to blunt the union drive. [...] On February 11, ERP representatives throughout Carnegie-Illinois Steel demanded a $5 per day minimum wage, <b>an</b> 80 <b>cent</b> <b>a</b> day wage increase, and a 40-hour work week.|$|R
