Three major cell types were identified. One population consisted of mononuclear cells with fibroblastic morphology, which proliferated in culture and most likely represent the neoplastic element of the tumor. Phenotypically they resembled a connective tissue stromal cell. A second population of mononuclear cells lacked receptors for skeletal hormones and did not persist in culture. These cells were likely of monocyte-macrophage lineage. A third population of cells consisted of large multinucleated giant cells.

40|$|A mucoadhesive spray-dried starch/poly(acrylic acid) powder {{underwent}} different {{heat treatments}} {{in order to}} induce cross-linking between the functional groups of starch (Amioca (R)) and poly(acrylic acid) (Carbopol (R) 974 P). After heat treatment the water-absorbing capacity, viscosity and elasticity of the mucoadhesive powder increased. NMR analysis in combination with FT-IR indicated that heat treatment induced a low degree of cross-linking between the polymers. Nasal administration of Amioca (R) /Carbopol (R) 974 P powders without heat treatment resulted in an absolute bioavailability in rabbits of 8. 2 +/- 3. 0 % for insulin. Due to the difference in water-absorbing capacity (which opened the tight junctions of the nasal mucosa), elasticity and plasticity (which reduced mucociliairy clearance and prolonged residence time) heat treatment at 120 degrees C improved the bioavailability: 26. 4 +/- 21. 9, 36. 5 +/- 11. 0 and 19. 3 +/- 17. 3 % after heat treatment during 30 min, 1 h and 4 h, respectively. Heat treatment at 60 degrees C was less efficient. This study demonstrated that the nasal insulin absorption improved via heat treatment of the Amioca (R) /Carbopol (R) 974 P powder (prior to the addition of insulin). The bioavailability-enhancing effect of a 1 h heat treatment at 120 degrees C was confirmed using the same polymer matrix in combination with different drugs (salmon <b>calcitonin,</b> <b>human</b> growth hormone and metoprolol tartrate).

40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>calcitonin</b> is the {{physiological}} hormone involved in calcium-phosphorus homeostasis. However, its use {{is limited by}} its propensity to form aggregates.

At pH 7, <b>human</b> <b>calcitonin</b> is able to interact and form channels with negatively charged dioleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) bilayers and with zwitterionic palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayers containing 15 % negatively-charged DOPG, but not with POPC bilayers. At low pH (4. 5 and 3. 8), the conformational variation of the peptide enables it to insert into POPC and POPC: DOPG but not into DOPG bilayers.

40|$|Recent {{immunohistochemical}} {{demonstration of}} calcitonin in rat pituitary {{has suggested that}} calcitonin, in addition to ACTH, endorphins, lipotropins, and melanocyte-stimulating hormones might be derived from a 31, 000 -dalton glycoprotein percursor molecule. This immunoperoxidase study demonstrates a similar distribution for beta-endorphin and ACTH immunoreactivity in human pituitary; however, the two peptides are not necessarily present in the same cells at all times. Calcitonin could not be demonstrated in human pituitary under conditions suitable for demonstration of the peptide in thyroid C cells. Weakly positive immunostaining could be obtained only with much increase in antiserum concentration and length of incubation, and higher concentrations of calcitonin were needed to abolish staining in preabsorption studies. It thus appears that the immunoreactive <b>calcitonin</b> in <b>human</b> pituitary differs from that in thyroid C cells.

Here we analyze the differences between sCT and hCT on the <b>human</b> <b>calcitonin</b> receptor (CT(a) R) with respect to activation of cAMP signaling, b-arrestin recruitment, ligand binding kinetics and internalization. The study was conducted using mammalian cell lines heterologously expressing the human CT(a) receptor.

CT(a) R kinetics and internalization was investigated with radio-labeled sCT and hCT ligands on cultured cells and isolated membrane preparations from the same cell line. We found that sCT and hCT are equipotent during short-term stimulations with differences manifesting themselves only during long-term stimulation with sCT inducing a prolonged activation up to 72 hours, while hCT loses activity markedly earlier. The prolonged sCT stimulation of both cAMP accumulation and b-arrestin recruitment was attenuated, but not abrogated by acid wash, suggesting a role for sCT activated internalized receptors.

After steady secretion was attained 20 min after the beginning of collection, five 2 -min fractions were obtained before, and ten 2 -min fractions were obtained after intravenous infusion of calcitonin (1 IU/kg/h).

40|$|Calcitonin is a 32 -amino acid {{thyroid hormone}} that can form amyloid fibrils. The {{structural}} {{basis of the}} fibril formation and stabilization is still debated and poorly understood.

We show that DFNKF fibrils are highly stable when assembled in parallel β-sheets, whereas they quickly unfold in antiparallel conformation. Our results indicate that the DFNKF peptide represents only partially the full-length calcitonin behavior.

Monolayer cultures of breast carcinomas maintained for up to 10 weeks released immunoreactive calcitonin, and a primary breast carcinoma passaged in "nude" mice {{for over a year}} contained material immunologically and chromatographically resembling the monomeric form of <b>human</b> <b>calcitonin.</b> These studies indicate that breast carcinomas can produce calcitonin and that plasma calcitonin measurements may be useful in staging patients with breast carcinomas...|$|R
40|$|A five-year-old boy {{presented}} with a three-and-a-half-year history of repeated bone fractures and progressive bone deformity. The excretion of hydroxyproline in the urine was greatly increased, and serum alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase levels were very high. These abnormalities together with the findings on bone histology and radiology suggested a diagnosis of juvenile Paget's disease. <b>Human</b> <b>calcitonin</b> reduced the bone turnover as evidenced by an immediate and sustained fall in urine hydroxyproline excretion, while calcium and phosphate balance became more positive. This treatment is therefore being continued on an outpatient basis...|$|R
40|$|Radioimmunoassay of <b>calcitonin</b> {{in normal}} <b>human</b> plasma is {{hindered}} by immunochemical heterogeneity in plasma, variable susceptibility of antisera to non-specific factors, limited assay sensitivity, and other problems. Many controversial {{points in the}} literature arise from these difficulties. Measurement of calcitonin after various extraction procedures yields greater consistency of results. Recent advances in calcitonin assay technology offer the promise of measuring calcitonin monomer with sufficient sensitivity to permit studies of normal calcitonin physiology and of the hormone's role in human disease.

40|$|Two mRNAs {{generated}} as {{a consequence}} of alternative RNA processing events in expression of the <b>human</b> <b>calcitonin</b> gene encode the protein precursors of either calcitonin or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Both calcitonin and CGRP RNAs and their encoded peptide products are expressed in the human pituitary and in medullary thyroid tumors. On the basis of sequence comparison, it is suggested that both the calcitonin and CGRP exons arose from a common primordial sequence, suggesting that duplication and rearrangement events are responsible for the generation of this complex transcription unit...|$|R
