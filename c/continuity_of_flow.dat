40|$|The fluid {{structure}} interaction {{mechanism in}} vascular dynamics {{can be described}} by either 3 D or 1 D models, depending {{on the level of}} detail of the flow and pressure patterns needed for analysis. A successful strategy that has been proposed in the past years is the so-called geometrical multiscale approach, which consists of coupling both 3 D and 1 D models so as to use the former only in those regions where details of the fluid flow are needed and describe the remaining part of the vascular network by the simplified 1 D model. In this paper we review recently proposed strategies to couple the 3 D and 1 D models, and within the 3 D model, to couple the fluid and structure sub-problems. The 3 D/ 1 D coupling strategy relies on the imposition of the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> rate and total normal stress at the interface.

40|$|Abstract — Electroosmotic flow is a {{convenient}} mechanism for transporting polar fluid in a microfluidic device. The flow is generated {{through the application}} of an external electric field that acts on the free charges that exists in a thin Debye layer at the channel walls. The charge on the wall is due to the chemistry of the solid-fluid interface, and it can vary along the channel, e. g. due to modification of the wall. This investigation focuses on the simulation <b>of</b> the electroosmotic <b>flow</b> (EOF) in a cylindrical microchannel with step change in zeta potential. The modified Navier-Stoke equation governing the velocity field and a non-linear two-dimensional Poisson-Boltzmann equation governing the electrical double-layer (EDL) field distribution are solved numerically using finite control-volume method. <b>Continuities</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> rate and electric current are enforced resulting in a non-uniform electrical field and pressure gradient distribution along the channel. The resulting parabolic velocity distribution at the junction of the step change in zeta potential, which is more typical of a pressure-driven velocity flow profile, is obtained...|$|R

40|$|The {{steady state}} {{characteristics}} of water lubricated journal bearings having multiple axial grooves are obtained theoretically. The novelty of these bearings {{is that the}} lubricant (water) is fed under pressure {{from one end of}} the bearing, through the multiple axial grooves (groove angles may vary). These bearings can use the process fluid as the lubricant, as in the case of feed water pumps. The Reynolds equation is solved numerically by the finite difference method satisfying the Jacobsson- Floberg-Olsson boundary conditions. Experimental results indicate that the pressure remains constant for a major portion of the groove, while theory predicts a linear pressure drop from inlet to exit. Comparison of load capacity, attitude angle, volume flow rate and friction variable for various bearing number and eccentricity ratios, assuming linear pressure drop along the groove, shows that there is a significant difference between those obtained by the Reynolds model and the Jacobsson-Floberg-Olsson model.

40|$|International audienceThe {{scarcity}} of biotic data versus the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> data {{is a first}} problem to be solve when trying to built a model of response to flow and related anthropogenic manipulations. Biotic - abiotic model building, for impact assessment or management purposes, requires mathematical links between biotic indices values and corresponding habitat conditions. Giving the fact that living species can integrate past habitat conditions in their behavior, correlations with instant habitat flow data from a biotic sampling moment are not adapted. This limit can be overcame developing a computer routine to calculate a series of antecedent Hydrological Indices (HIs) into incremented periods backwards in time from biotic sampling dates. Correlation analysis is used to select significantly related HIs to biotic indices resulting from sporadic surveys at a same location. This method allows to quantify the time of response of the biota and duration of effect of given HIs on this water course biota.
