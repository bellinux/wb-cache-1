5|$|The GWR {{provided}} special wagons, {{handling equipment}} and storage facilities for its largest traffic flows. For example, the coal mines in Wales sent {{much of their}} coal to the docks along the coast, {{many of which were}} owned and equipped by the railway, as were some in Cornwall that exported most of the <b>china</b> <b>clay</b> production of that county. The wagons provided for both these traffic flows (both those owned by the GWR and the mining companies) were fitted with end doors that allowed their loads to be tipped straight into the ships' holds using wagon-tipping equipment on the dockside. Special wagons were produced for many other different commodities such as gunpowder, aeroplanes, milk, fruit and fish.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Industrial Revolution, Plymouth grew as a {{commercial}} shipping port, handling imports and passengers from the Americas, and exporting local minerals (tin, copper, lime, <b>china</b> <b>clay</b> and arsenic). The neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town. In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the county borough of Plymouth, the county borough of Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in 1928, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its being targeted by the German military and partially destroyed by bombing during World War II, an act known as the Plymouth Blitz. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{proportion}} of bal maidens in the workforce fell steadily, the mining boom {{of the first half}} of the 19thcentury took the total number to between 4,000 and 14,400 by the 1840s. The 1841 Census (the first full census of England) shows 3,250 women working in the mines, but the mine returns of the same year show over 5,000 women in the tin, lead and copper mines of Cornwall and West Devon. Increased mechanisation of the ore dressing process and public concerns over subjecting women and children to the harsh working conditions of the mines meant that {{the proportion}} of bal maidens in the workforce continued to fall, and it is generally accepted that by 1850 between 15 and 20% of mine workers were female. By the 1861 census, coinciding with the peak of the Cornish mining industry, a minimum of 6,000 women were working in mining in Cornwall, at least 2,500 of whom worked within a five-mile radius of Camborne. Although employed primarily in copper and tin mines, bal maidens also worked in lead, zinc, manganese, iron, antimony, wolfram, and uranium mines, and in slate and <b>china</b> <b>clay</b> quarries.|$|E

25|$|It {{was long}} {{believed}} that later in 1909, the Post Office experimented briefly with another paper-type {{designed to reduce}} shrinkage, one containing a <b>China</b> <b>clay</b> additive that gave its appearance a grayish tone {{very similar to that}} of bluish-paper. China-clay versions of the 1¢ through 15¢ values are listed in standard catalogues—appearing as variants of the 1908–09 stamps, rather than being classified as a separate series or as part of the bluish paper issue.

25|$|The factory at Sèvres was nationalized in 1793 {{after the}} French Revolution. After 1800 it stopped {{producing}} soft-paste and standardized on an unusually hard type of hard-paste using <b>china</b> <b>clay</b> from Saint-Yrieix, near Limoges. The factory produced many different painted designs for decoration. Later in the 19th century the art director Théodore Deck (1823–91) introduced manufacture of siliceous soft-paste pieces. The factory could make large objects {{that did not}} crack or split, {{and that could be}} decorated in rich colors due to the low firing temperature.|$|E
25|$|The {{intrusion}} of the granite {{into the surrounding}} sedimentary rocks gave rise to extensive metamorphism and mineralisation, and this led to Cornwall {{being one of the}} most important mining areas in Europe until the early 20th century. It is thought tin was mined here as early as the Bronze Age, and copper, lead, zinc and silver have all been mined in Cornwall. Alteration of the granite also gave rise to extensive deposits of <b>China</b> <b>Clay,</b> especially in the area to the north of St Austell, and the extraction of this remains an important industry.|$|E

To mark this development, Imetal changed its name, giving birth to Imerys on 22 September 1999.|$|R
25|$|The urban {{populations of}} Plymouth, Devonport and Stonehouse traded {{a variety of}} mineral ores such as copper, lime, tin and arsenic from the rural hinterlands via mining ports such as Morwellham Quay, Oreston the Stannary Towns of Tavistock and Plympton and small {{industrial}} towns throughout South Devon & East Cornwall. Around 1745, local apothecary William Cookworthy unravelled the then unknown formula for Chinese porcelain and developed the earliest English porcelain ware, Plymouth China manufactured for just {{two years in the}} town, but establishing the <b>China</b> <b>Clay</b> extraction industry in the region.|$|E
25|$|Since the 17th century, {{the area}} has been almost {{exclusively}} known for its industrial-scale pottery manufacturing. Companies such as Royal Doulton, Dudson Ltd, Spode (founded by Josiah Spode), Wedgwood (founded by Josiah Wedgwood), Minton (founded by Thomas Minton) and Baker & Co. (founded by William Baker) were established and based there. The local abundance of coal and clay suitable for earthenware production led to the early (initially limited) development of the local pottery industry. The construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal (completed in 1777) enabled the import of <b>china</b> <b>clay</b> from Cornwall together with other materials and facilitated the production of creamware and bone china.|$|E
25|$|Historically mining of tin (and later also of copper) was {{important}} in the Cornish economy. The first reference to {{this appears to be}} by Pytheas: see above. Julius Caesar was the last classical writer to mention the tin trade, which appears to have declined during the Roman occupation. The tin trade revived in the Middle Ages and its importance to the Kings of England resulted in certain privileges being granted to the tinners; the Cornish Rebellion of 1497 is attributed to grievances of the tin miners. In the mid-19th century, however, the tin trade again fell into decline. Other primary industries that have declined since the 1960s include <b>china</b> <b>clay</b> production, fishing and farming.|$|E

In 2000, several mainline railways were full to capacity, yet requests by EWS and English <b>China</b> <b>Clays</b> to reopen lost rail links for freight paths such as the former Weedon to Leamington Spa line were refused by the charity. Sustrans refused to support the application unless the rail promoter provided an alternative cycle track; EWS responded it was an uneconomic provision for both reopening and building replacement pathway expenses. Objections by Sustrans allegedly mean that freight now has to continue to move by road through the local villages.|$|R
25|$|Mining of tin {{and copper}} {{was also an}} industry, but today the {{derelict}} mine workings survive only as a World Heritage Site. However, the Camborne School of Mines, which was relocated to Penryn in 2004, is still a world centre of excellence {{in the field of}} mining and applied geology and the grant of World Heritage status has attracted funding for conservation and heritage tourism. <b>China</b> <b>clay</b> extraction has also been an important industry in the St Austell area, but this sector has been in decline, and this, coupled with increased mechanisation, has led to a decrease in employment in this sector, although the industry still employs around 2,133 people in Cornwall, and generates over £80 Million to the local economy.|$|E
25|$|The first Washington-Franklin stamp issued was a two-cent red Washington-head, {{issued on}} November 16, 1908, {{to pay the}} first class postage on a {{standard}} letter. The seven separate and distinct Washington-Franklin series appeared at intervals of {{a year or two}} and included denominations that ranged from 1-cent to 1 or 5 dollars, depending on the series. The different issues can be distinguished from one another by one or more of several factors: perforation gauge, the type of stamp paper—or, in some unusual varieties, by the printing method used. Four or five basic paper-types were employed during the life of the issue. Two of these have different watermarks (consisting of single-line and double line letters: 'USPS'), while another paper-type had no watermarks (watermarks are detected by placing the stamp in a special fluid). In 1909 a much less common type of bluish paper was used, made of 35% rag stock combined with the usual wood pulp and can readily be identified by its faint bluish-gray color. (N. B., Some contend that bluish paper contained only 10% rag stock.) Later in the same year the Post Office is supposed to have experimented with <b>China</b> <b>clay</b> paper, but whether such a paper stock actually existed has become a matter of dispute.|$|E
