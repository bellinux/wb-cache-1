40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of Service-Oriented Computing, {{applications}} can be developed following the REST (Representation State Transfer) architectural style. This style corresponds to a resource oriented model, where resources are manipulated via CRUD (<b>Create,</b> <b>Request,</b> Update, Delete) interfaces. The diversity of CRUD languages due {{to the absence of}} a standard leads to composition problems related to adaptation, integration and coordination of services. To overcome these problems, we propose a pivot architecture built around a universal language to manipulate resources, called CREOLE, a CRUD Language for Resource Edition. In this architecture, scripts written in existing CRUD languages, like SQL, are compiled into CREOLE and then executed over different CRUD interfaces. After stating the requirements for a universal language for manipulating resources, we formally describe the language and informally motivate its definition with respect to the requirements. We then concretely show how the architecture solves adaptation, integration and coordination problems in the case of photo management in Flickr and Picasa, two well-known service-oriented applications. Finally, we propose a roadmap for future work...|$|E

Displaying text and numeric data by county {{on a state}} map is different from displaying state-level data on a U. S. map. Long county names rather than twoletter state abbreviations require additional effort by a programmer to create a readable map.

40|$|Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) {{vulnerabilities}} constitute one of {{the most}} serious web application vulnerabilities, ranking fourth in the CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can submit requests to a web application using a victim user’s credentials. A successful attack can lead to compromised accounts, stolen bank funds or information leaks. This paper presents a new server-side defense against CSRF attacks. Our solution, called jCSRF, operates as a serverside proxy, and does not require any server or browser modifications. Thus, it can be deployed by a site administrator without requiring access to web application source code, or the need to understand it. Moreover, protection is achieved without requiring web-site users to make use of a specific browser or a browser plug-in. Unlike previous server-side solutions, jCSRF addresses two key aspects of Web 2. 0 : extensive use of client-side scripts that can <b>create</b> <b>requests</b> to URLs that do not appear in the HTML page returned to the client; and services provided by two or more collaborating web sites that need to make cross-domain requests. 1...|$|R
