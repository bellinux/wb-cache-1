5000|$|Tax rates {{vary widely}} among jurisdictions. [...] They are {{generally}} {{set by the}} taxing jurisdiction's governing body. [...] The method of determining the rate varies widely, but may be constrained under laws of particular states. In some jurisdictions, property is taxed based on its <b>classification.</b> <b>Classification</b> is the grouping of properties based on similar use. Examples of classification are residential, commercial, industrial, vacant, and blighted real property. Property classification are used to tax properties at different rates and for different public policy purposes. In Washington D.C. for instance property occupancy is incentivized by taxing residential property at 0.85 percent of assessed value but vacant residential property at 5 percent of assessed value.|$|E

Different research groups categorize clones with respect to different contexts. In this paper we review all such available categories of clones and present them {{in the form of}} a High Level Clone <b>Classification.</b> <b>Classification</b> can serve various purposes like studying the more frequently occurring high level clones, prioritizing different types of high level clones, devising re-engineering strategies for different types of high level clones etc [...] For this classification of HLC we develop a fuzzy rule-based system and also visualize the results.

Operators constructed from logical building blocks are convolved with texture images. An optimal set of six {{operators are}} selected based on their texture discrimination ability. The responses are then converted to standard deviation matrices computed over a sliding window. Zonal sampling features are computed from these matrices. A feature selection process is applied and the new set of features are used for texture <b>classification.</b> <b>Classification</b> of texture images and a segmentation experiment are presented. The Euclidean distance classifier is found to perform best with this algorithm. Results show that this algorithm performs efficiently in classifying texture images. 1...|$|E
