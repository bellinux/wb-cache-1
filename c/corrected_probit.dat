40|$|Papaya leaves ethanol extract was {{evaluated}} for anthelmintic activity on pig roundworm by in vitro assay. The {{aim of this}} research is to know whether papaya leaves ethanol extract has anthelmintic activity and to determine LC 100 and LT 100 values of papaya leaves ethanol extract. Anthelmintic activity test was done by using 7 groups with 3 repetition. Group I soaked in CMC-Na 0, 5 % as control negative; group II soaked in albendazole suspense 0, 6 % as control positive; groups III-VII soaked in papaya leaves ethanol extract suspense (0, 6 %; 1, 2 %; 2, 4 %; 4, 8 %; and 9, 6 % respectively) for 40 hours. Observation was done every 2 hours to know mortality of pig roundworm. Percentage of pig roundworm mortality were analyse by Kruskal-Wallis test along with Mann-Whitney test. LC 100 and LT 100 value was determine using <b>corrected</b> <b>probit</b> analysis. Papaya leaves ethanol extract at dosage 1, 2 %; 2, 4 %; 4, 8 %; dan 9, 6 % has a anthelmintic activity because gives a significant value in mortality of pig roundworm if compare with control negative (p< 0, 05). From <b>corrected</b> <b>probit</b> analysis papaya leaves ethanol extract has LC 100 in 8, 301 % b/v and LT 100 in 28, 885 hours...|$|E
40|$|Wright for helpful {{comments}} on earlier drafts. While the main theoretical benefit of patent protection is increased innovation, some assert a swamped U. S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted an inefficiently large number of patents with negligible innovation value. I test this argument’s plausibility and determine the characteristics of patents without innovation by analyzing 980 litigated patents subject to anticipation or obviousness decisions between 2000 and 2010. Using a selection <b>corrected</b> <b>probit</b> model, I obtain unconditional estimates of the likelihood patents with given characteristics lack innovation value. I estimate a surprising 28 percent of all patents would be found at least partially invalid if litigated. Software, business method and licensing firm-owned patents possess significantly higher innovation-based invalidity rates. Miller: Where’s the Innovation? 1 1...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{selection}} <b>corrected</b> <b>probit,</b> I estimate {{the probability that}} patents will be found valid and infringed at trial. I combine {{for the first time}} detailed adjudication data with detailed patent data. I find that the selection effects for validity adjudications and infringement adjudications differ systematically. Additionally, infringement estimates do not appear to suffer from a substantial selection bias. The results highlight the importance of correctly specifying the selection mechanism in policy analysis. In contrast with previous studies, I find that the win rate for patents that go to trial is biased towards 50 %. The bias is much more substantial for validity decisions, where I find unconditional win rates of 75 % for adjudicated patents and 85 % for matched patents. Win rates conditional on adjudication are below 60 %. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} social {{transfers}} on individual participation and working hours are theoretically shown to differ for unitary and bargaining intrahousehold allocation models. This result {{is attributed to}} both the non-transferability of in-kind social transfers and differences in control of these transfers among household members. Using elasticities of social transfers on work effort (estimated through sample selection <b>corrected</b> participation <b>probits</b> and working hour OLS), new tests on intrahousehold allocation are developed for Chile. These tests strongly reject the unitary model and exogenous bargaining, accepting endogenous bargaining only among non-poor households. Poor households may use social incomes as investments for the future rather than for short-term strategic power relations...|$|R

We investigate overeducation in such a context, focusing on employment density. In this paper we restrict our analysis on a statistical approach of the overeducation phenomenon both for skill levels and wages of the early career of French people. Selective access to employment is <b>corrected</b> using a <b>probit</b> analysis with sample selection. Estimations highlight the importance of the characteristics of the labor market to avoid overeducation, more particularly : employment density, commuting time, increase in population or unemployment rate. We also emphasize a substitution (complementary) effect between unemployment and overeducation from a skill (salary) point of view...|$|R
40|$|Vine-growing in the Less-Favoured Areas of Greece {{is facing}} {{multiple}} challenges {{that might lead}} to its abandonment. In an attempt to maintain rural populations, Rural Development Schemes have been created that offer the opportunity to rural households to maintain or expand their farming businesses including vine-growing. This paper stems from a study that used data from a cross-sectional survey of 204 farmers to investigate how farming systems and farmers’ perception of corruption, amongst other socio-economic factors, affected their decisions to continue vine-growing through participation in Rural Development Schemes, in three remote Less-Favoured Areas of Greece. The Theory of Planned Behaviour was used to frame the research problem with the assumption being that an individual’s intention to participate in a Scheme is based on their prior beliefs about it. Data from the survey were reduced and simplified by the use of non-linear principal component analysis. The ensuing variables were used in selectivity <b>corrected</b> ordered <b>probit</b> models to reveal farmers’ attitudes towards viticulture and rural development. It was found that economic factors, perceived corruption and farmers’ attitudes were significant determinants on whether to participate in the Schemes. The research findings highlight the important role of perceived corruption and the need for policies that facilitate farmers’ access to decision making centres...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how within-couple inequalities, that is power {{differences between men}} and women in a partnership, act as predictors of transitions from full-time to part-time employment applying Heckman <b>corrected</b> <b>probit</b> models in three different institutional and cultural contexts; Eastern Germany, Western Germany and the United Kingdom. The analyses show that when women are in a weaker position within their relationships they are more likely to drop-out of full-time work, but that this propensity varies by context. The authors also find an increased tendency over time for women to leave full-time for part-time employment in both Eastern and Western Germany, but observe no such trend in the UK. This is suggestive of ongoing incompatibilities in the institutional support for equality in dual-earning in Germany. The study uses longitudinal data covering the period 1992 until 2012 from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for Germany and from the British Household Panel (BHPS) and the ‘Understanding Society’ data for the UK...|$|E
