5000|$|Behavioral styles theory: Blake and Mouton, {{in their}} {{managerial}} grid model, proposed five leadership styles {{based on two}} axes - <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> the task versus <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> people. They suggested that the ideal is the [...] "team style", which balances <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> the task with <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> people. Scouller (2011) argued that this ideal approach may not suit all circumstances; for example, emergencies or turnarounds.|$|R

5|$|As {{early as}} 1966 Uptown {{was among the}} {{possible}} sites proposed for a northeast-side commuter campus in the City Colleges of Chicago community college district. The Uptown site west of the Wilson Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) station was opposed by those <b>concerned</b> <b>for</b> the displacement of low income residents, largely blacks, southern whites and American Indians. The project was mired in heated controversy for decades. Avery v Pierce, a federal lawsuit filed in 1975, alleged that the razing of about 3,000 low-income housing units {{for the development of}} Harry S Truman College constituted misspending of funds by the City and Chicago Housing Authority. Plaintiffs were represented by Shiller's former campaign manager, attorney James P. Chapman of the Uptown Peoples Law Center.|$|E

40|$|<b>Concerns</b> <b>for</b> {{relative}} {{performance are}} {{integrated into a}} model of contractual renegotiation in bilateral trade. It is shown that <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> relative performance do never impede efficient trade. Moreover, conditional on renegotiation to occur, <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> relative performance tend to mitigate material rent expropriation. However, <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> relative performance make the occurrence of renegotiation more likely, and may thereby lead to underinvestment even in very optimistic environments.

Among Rowan's classmates at the Academy were future U.S. Attorney General Felix Grundy, future U.S. Senator John Pope, future U.S. District Attorney Joseph Hamilton Daveiss, and future Kentucky state senator John Allen.

5|$|HIAG {{embraced the}} Suchdienst activities, {{not only because}} it was <b>concerned</b> <b>for</b> the fate of some 40,000 members of the Waffen-SS who were missing in action, but because this {{outwardly}} humanitarian and non-political activity could help improve its perception by the West German government and the society at large. Such public relations activities ("image polishing", according to Large) were important to HIAG as it faced on-going scrutiny, and even calls for a ban on the organisation. The Suchdiensttreffen events (literally: tracing service meetings) later evolved into annual Kameradschaftstreffen ("veterans' reunions"), which were large-scale conventions, often accompanied by rallies.|$|E

Unbeknown to the family, Adil is actually a spy sent by his government to obtain blueprints of the Springfield nuclear plant's reactor.

5|$|Rajam died of typhoid in 1939.

This book, like his first two books, is autobiographical, but more so, and completes an unintentional thematic trilogy following Swami and Friends and The Bachelor of Arts. In subsequent interviews, Narayan acknowledges that The English Teacher was almost entirely an autobiography, albeit with different names for the characters and the change of setting in Malgudi; he also explains that the emotions detailed in the book reflected his own at the time of Rajam's death.|$|E
5|$|The Derwent Valley is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} factory system. The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production. Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill and the associated workers' settlement provided a template for industrial communities, not just in the valley but internationally. The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright's model lead to other industrialists copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees. As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour, the industrialists were also <b>concerned</b> <b>for</b> their employees and families and acted {{out of a sense of}} paternalism.|$|E
