5000|$|Behavioral styles theory: Blake and Mouton, {{in their}} {{managerial}} grid model, proposed five leadership styles {{based on two}} axes - <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> the task versus <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> people. They suggested that the ideal is the [...] "team style", which balances <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> the task with <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> people. Scouller (2011) argued that this ideal approach may not suit all circumstances; for example, emergencies or turnarounds.|$|R

5|$|As {{early as}} 1966 Uptown {{was among the}} {{possible}} sites proposed for a northeast-side commuter campus in the City Colleges of Chicago community college district. The Uptown site west of the Wilson Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) station was opposed by those <b>concerned</b> <b>for</b> the displacement of low income residents, largely blacks, southern whites and American Indians. The project was mired in heated controversy for decades. Avery v Pierce, a federal lawsuit filed in 1975, alleged that the razing of about 3,000 low-income housing units {{for the development of}} Harry S Truman College constituted misspending of funds by the City and Chicago Housing Authority. Plaintiffs were represented by Shiller's former campaign manager, attorney James P. Chapman of the Uptown Peoples Law Center.|$|E

In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed to also take up this position, on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three.|$|E

40|$|<b>Concerns</b> <b>for</b> {{relative}} {{performance are}} {{integrated into a}} model of contractual renegotiation in bilateral trade. It is shown that <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> relative performance do never impede efficient trade. Moreover, conditional on renegotiation to occur, <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> relative performance tend to mitigate material rent expropriation. However, <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> relative performance make the occurrence of renegotiation more likely, and may thereby lead to underinvestment even in very optimistic environments. The analysis suggests {{an explanation for the}} occurrence of the Druzhba pipeline conflict between Russia and Belarus in January 2007.

5|$|<b>Concerned</b> <b>for</b> the {{education}} of his children, Captain Rowan moved the family to Bardstown, Kentucky in 1790. There, John Rowan began his education under Dr. James Priestly at Salem Academy. Salem Academy was, at the time, {{considered one of the}} best educational institutions in the west. Among Rowan's classmates at the Academy were future U.S. Attorney General Felix Grundy, future U.S. Senator John Pope, future U.S. District Attorney Joseph Hamilton Daveiss, and future Kentucky state senator John Allen. Rowan and Grundy were members of a debating society called the Bardstown Pleiades which may have been an outgrowth of Salem Academy. Other notable members of the society included future Florida Governor William Pope Duval, future U.S. Postmaster General and Kentucky Governor Charles A. Wickliffe, and future Kentucky Senator Benjamin Hardin.|$|E

Unfortunately, the house is destroyed seconds later when Li'l Bandit and Wiggum's police car crash through the house. Marge returns Flanders' down payment.

At the end of the episode, Homer takes Marge to the government unemployment office to collect a welfare check.|$|E
5|$|HIAG {{embraced the}} Suchdienst activities, {{not only because}} it was <b>concerned</b> <b>for</b> the fate of some 40,000 members of the Waffen-SS who were missing in action, but because this {{outwardly}} humanitarian and non-political activity could help improve its perception by the West German government and the society at large. Such public relations activities ("image polishing", according to Large) were important to HIAG as it faced on-going scrutiny, and even calls for a ban on the organisation. The Suchdiensttreffen events (literally: tracing service meetings) later evolved into annual Kameradschaftstreffen ("veterans' reunions"), which were large-scale conventions, often accompanied by rallies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1278 Ivaylo entered Tarnovo in triumph, married Maria and was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria. However, since he was inexperienced in state affairs, Ivaylo failed to {{consolidate}} his authority over the nobility in the capital, who were <b>concerned</b> <b>for</b> their own influence, and often quarrelled with Maria. He still {{had to deal with}} overwhelming challenges— the Byzantines dispatched many troops under the command of Michael Glabas in support of Ivan Asen III and incited the Mongols to attack from the north to open war on two fronts. Yet Ivaylo vigorously prepared his forces to counter the adversaries and managed to gain support among many nobles.|$|E

As Iain and Jez search for Grace they find her in a critical condition and call for an air ambulance to escort her to hospital.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Springfield, Adil {{arrives and}} {{turns out to}} be very friendly, helping out Marge with the family chores. Homer {{immediately}} takes a shine to him, and it is noticeable that he is a better son and role model than Bart ever was. However, Marge challenges Homer that while she appreciates Adil's good behavior, part of being good parents is that they have the same respect for their natural children, in that is Homer being <b>concerned</b> <b>for</b> Bart while he is abroad. Unbeknown to the family, Adil is actually a spy sent by his government to obtain blueprints of the Springfield nuclear plant's reactor. Homer unwittingly takes him {{on a tour of the}} power plant and thinks nothing of the many photographs Adil takes, which Adil sends home by a secret fax machine in Bart's tree house.|$|E

The BCOF would serve under American command, with American policy being followed. Northcott was offered, and accepted, the post of Governor of New South Wales in April 1946.

5|$|Rajam died of typhoid in 1939. Her death {{affected}} Narayan {{deeply and}} he remained depressed {{for a long}} time; he was also <b>concerned</b> <b>for</b> their daughter Hema, who was only three years old.

This book, like his first two books, is autobiographical, but more so, and completes an unintentional thematic trilogy following Swami and Friends and The Bachelor of Arts. In subsequent interviews, Narayan acknowledges that The English Teacher was almost entirely an autobiography, albeit with different names for the characters and the change of setting in Malgudi; he also explains that the emotions detailed in the book reflected his own at the time of Rajam's death.|$|E
5|$|The Derwent Valley is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} factory system. The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production. Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill and the associated workers' settlement provided a template for industrial communities, not just in the valley but internationally. The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright's model lead to other industrialists copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees. As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour, the industrialists were also <b>concerned</b> <b>for</b> their employees and families and acted {{out of a sense of}} paternalism.|$|E

50|$|The {{residence}} displays many characteristics which Dods {{valued in}} domestic architecture.

5000|$|In contrast, yielding, “accommodating”, {{smoothing}} or suppression conflict {{styles are}} characterized by {{a high level of}} <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> others and a low level of <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> oneself. This passive pro-social approach emerges when individuals derive personal satisfaction from meeting the needs of others and have a general <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> maintaining stable, positive social relationships. When faced with conflict, individuals with a yielding conflict style tend to harmonize into others’ demands out of respect for the social relationship.|$|R
