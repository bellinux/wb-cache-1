Experiments have yielded mixed results using this technique in animal models and preliminary human clinical trials.

Likewise, there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease. Many of the newest drugs {{as well as those}} under development are probably going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS, and their improved effectiveness when compared with previously existing drugs may eventually lead to a positive result in these groups of patients.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>therapies</b> {{offer the}} promise of {{treating}} and altering the course of diseases which cannot be addressed adequately by existing pharmaceuticals. <b>Cell</b> <b>therapies</b> are a diverse group across cell types and therapeutic indications and have been an active area of research for many years but are now strongly emerging through translation and towards successful commercial development and patient access. In this article, we present {{a description of a}} classification of <b>cell</b> <b>therapies</b> {{on the basis of their}} underlying technologies rather than the more commonly used classification by cell type because the regulatory path and manufacturing solutions are often similar within a technology area due to the nature of the methods used. We analyse the progress of new <b>cell</b> <b>therapies</b> towards clinical translation, examine how they are addressing the clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and reimbursement requirements, describe some of the remaining challenges and provide perspectives on how the field may progress for the future.

5|$|The primary aims {{of therapy}} are {{returning}} function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications {{used in the}} management of MS may have several adverse effects, and many possible therapies are still under investigation.

5|$|The first likely {{description}} of the disease was in 1841 by Charles Oscar Waters. The condition was described in further detail in 1872 by George Huntington, after whom it is named. The genetic basis was discovered in 1993 by an international collaborative effort led by the Hereditary Disease Foundation. Research and support organizations began forming in the late 1960s to increase public awareness, to provide support for individuals and their families, and to promote research. Current research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the disease, improving animal models to aid with research, testing of medications to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease, and studying procedures such as stem <b>cell</b> <b>therapy</b> {{with the goal of}} repairing damage caused by the disease.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of private clinics in Australia are marketing and providing autologous stem <b>cell</b> <b>therapies</b> to patients. Although advocates point {{to the importance of}} medical innovation and the primacy of patient choice, these arguments are unconvincing. First, it is a stark truth that these clinics are flourishing while the efficacy and safety of autologous stem <b>cell</b> <b>therapies,</b> outside of established indications for hematopioetic stem cell transplantation, are yet to be shown. Second, few of these therapies are offered within clinical trials. Third, patients with chronic and debilitating illnesses, who are often the ones who take up these therapies, incur significant financial burdens in the expectation of benefiting from these treatments. Finally, the provision of these stem <b>cell</b> <b>therapies</b> does not follow the established pathways for legitimate medical advancement.

25|$|Cells {{produced}} with SCNT, or iPSCs could eventually {{be used in}} stem <b>cell</b> <b>therapy,</b> or to create organs {{to be used in}} transplantation, known as regenerative medicine. Stem <b>cell</b> <b>therapy</b> is the use of stem cells to treat or prevent a disease or condition. Bone marrow transplantation is a widely used form of stem <b>cell</b> <b>therapy.</b> No other forms of stem <b>cell</b> <b>therapy</b> are in clinical use at this time. Research is underway to potentially use stem <b>cell</b> <b>therapy</b> to treat heart disease, diabetes, and spinal cord injuries. Regenerative medicine is not in clinical practice, but is heavily researched for its potential uses. This type of medicine would allow for autologous transplantation, thus removing the risk of organ transplant rejection by the recipient. For instance, a person with liver disease could potentially have a new liver grown using their same genetic material and transplanted to remove the damaged liver. In current research, human pluripotent stem cells have been promised as a reliable source for generating human neurons, showing the potential for regenerative medicine in brain and neural injuries.|$|E

40|$|Engineered T {{cells are}} {{currently}} in clinical trials to treat patients with cancer, solid organ transplants, and autoimmune diseases. However, the field {{is still in its}} infancy. The design, and manufacturing, of T <b>cell</b> <b>therapies</b> is not standardized and is performed mostly in academic settings by competing groups. Reliable methods to define dose and pharmacokinetics of T <b>cell</b> <b>therapies</b> need to be developed. As of mid- 2016, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved T cell therapeutics on the market, and FDA regulations are only slowly adapting to the new technologies.

25|$|Swiss doctor Paul Niehans, {{who was one}} of {{the fathers}} of {{cellular}} therapy, developed in 1931–1949 years the so-called Fresh <b>cell</b> <b>therapy.</b> Fresh <b>cell</b> <b>therapy</b> is mainly the use of live animal embryo organs cells which are injected into the patient with the purpose of achieving a revitalizing effect. These cells are generally extracted from sheep’s fetuses because in comparison to other animals, like pigs, rabbits and cows, sheep are clean animals and rarely contact diseases. Of course animal cells are not able to be included in human tissue, but they can secrete factors for rejuvenating. That's why this rejuvenation technology, despite the harsh criticism is practiced to this day.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{long-term}} risk of malignancy {{associated with}} stem <b>cell</b> <b>therapies</b> {{is a significant}} concern in the clinical application of this exciting technology. We report a cancer-selective strategy to enhance the safety of stem <b>cell</b> <b>therapies.</b> Briefly, using a cell engineering approach, we show that aggressive cancers derived from human or murine {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are strikingly sensitive to temporary MYC blockade. On the other hand, differentiated tissues derived from human or mouse iPSCs can readily tolerate temporary MYC inactivation. In cancer cells, endogenous MYC is required to maintain the metabolic and epigenetic functions of the embryonic and cancer-specific pyruvate kinase M 2 isoform (PKM 2). In summary, our results implicate PKM 2 in cancer’s increased MYC dependence and indicate dominant MYC inhibition as a cancer-selective fail-safe for stem <b>cell</b> <b>therapies...</b>|$|R
