40|$|South Africa, {{and indeed}} many other countries, {{has in the}} past years been in the process of {{developing}} her <b>agricultural</b> <b>statistics</b> strategy. The <b>agricultural</b> <b>statistics</b> strategy was developed to guide to all matters related to the collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of <b>agricultural</b> <b>statistics.</b> A country’s <b>agricultural</b> <b>statistics</b> are aimed at addressing planning, policy, evaluation and developmental issues related to the agricultural sector and the country at large. The first motive for a country to develop an agricultural strategy is, naturally, to address these national issues. South Africa is no exception in this regard. However, there were other factors, which catalysed the development of the strategy. Firstly, to align the country’s <b>agricultural</b> <b>statistics</b> processes to the Global Strategy for the improvement of <b>agricultural</b> and rural <b>statistics</b> as specified by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and its partners.

40|$|Abstract: Agriculture is {{the basis}} of {{national}} economy of China. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>statistics</b> {{is one of the key}} points of Chinese statistic work. Nowadays, the worldwide Earth Observation System (EOS) by Remote Sensing has been increasingly improved and the multi-temporal and multi-resolution EOS has been forming as well. The rapid development of Remote Sensing technology serves as the solid technological foundation for the in-depth application of Chinese <b>agricultural</b> <b>statistics.</b> This paper introduced the current situation of Chinese <b>agricultural</b> <b>statistics</b> and the achievement of each department on the statistic work of agricultural Remote Sensing. And the difficulties of Remote Sensing technology in <b>agricultural</b> <b>statistics</b> were also analyzed in terms of the situation of Chinese agriculture. Furthermore, the paper introduced the project of “National Statistic Remote Sensing Operational System Key Technology and Application ” in particular, which is assumed by National Bureau of Statistics of China. The rural Earth sampling method and the technological course as well as the implementation scheme of the Remote Sensing survey on the planting area and yield of the main crops were elaborated. The current research development and application of the project were also involved. Key words: Remote Sensing; <b>agricultural</b> <b>statistics,</b> crop, yield estimation, planting are...|$|R

During the 150 years history of Hungarian <b>statistics</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>statistics</b> have always been in the forefront of developments and their implementation. The developments that were realized through the years concerned equally the functioning of the system of <b>agricultural</b> <b>statistics,</b> the methods used, the technical solutions applied, but they also brought numerous novelties in the communication of agricultural data. It is maybe not a lack of modesty to mention that in the majority of cases, developments in the field of <b>agricultural</b> <b>statistics</b> have infl uenced the whole Hungarian statistical system. It does not happen frequently either that thanks to statistics, new concepts are introduced in agricultural terminology, statistical data influence the development of agricultural policy. It is not easy and would maybe be unworthy to qualify or rank the developments presented in this article. Nevertheless I would like to highlight among them – due to their novelty and specifi cities – two major developments, the elaboration and use of spot maps, and the setting up and introduction of the unified (electronic) data processing system. I hope however that the solution we used to publish quickly preliminary census data, the database of the plantation survey using geo-coordinates, or the agricultural atlas and interactive graphs used in <b>agricultural</b> <b>statistics</b> will also arouse the interest of the reader...|$|R
