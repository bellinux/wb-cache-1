5|$|An {{alliance}} between Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and Muhammad ibn Saud {{led to the}} formation the first Saudi State (also known as the Emirate of Diriyah), challenging the authority of the Ottoman Empire. Most of the Najd was under Ibn Saud's control by the time Muhammad bin Saud died in 1765. By 1806, the Hijaz, including Mecca and Medina, was {{under the control of the}} Sauds. The expansion of Wahhabi movement <b>came</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> expense of the Ottoman empires' losing the control over Islam's holy places. Consequently, Ottoman Empire sent armies and defeated the first Saudi state in the Ottoman–Wahhabi War (1811–1818).

5|$|Brasenose lost 115 {{men in the}} First World War (including {{a quarter}} of the 1913 year), with its {{undergraduate}} numbers greatly reduced. Lord Curzon's post-War reforms were successfully instituted. The inter-war period was defined by William Stallybrass, who as fellow and eventual Principal (until 1948) dominated college life. Brasenose once again produced top sportsmen– cricketers, rowers, and others. This <b>came</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cost of falling academic standards and poorly performing finances, which would see Stallybrass' authority challenged. He died in a railway accident before he could be forced out, however. After the war, sporting achievements waned (although there were notable exceptions) but academic success did not improve significantly, in what was now one of Oxford's largest colleges.|$|E
