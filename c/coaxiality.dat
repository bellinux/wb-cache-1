40|$|Abstract. The {{electronic}} or pneumatic multi-section and multi-probe gauges {{are widely}} used for diameter and <b>coaxiality</b> measurements due to their high measurement efficiency in workshops. However, their measurement accuracy is determined mainly by the manufacturing errors of the assembly <b>coaxiality</b> master, therefore, how to establish <b>coaxiality</b> measurement datum reference is the key technology. The physical <b>coaxiality</b> masters {{are expected to be}} the impossible "zero error datum reference". The higher manufacturing accuracy of the masters, the more expensive for their manufacturing costs. A novel mathematical method on the basis of error separation principle was proposed in order to separate the manufacturing errors of the master. The basic principle is that the eccentric error of the <b>coaxiality</b> master can be expressed as the first harmonic function and the ideal zero-error datum reference could be established by the mathematical method of two sampling operations in phase difference of 180 ° in <b>coaxiality</b> master for gauge initialization. This method can be called as "mathematical datum reference " for <b>coaxiality</b> measurement. Experimental results indicate that the <b>coaxiality</b> measurement results of the multi-section and multi-probe gauge by the novel mathematical method coincide with those of the three-coordinate measuring machine and the maximum difference of both is about 0. 0014 mm. The new <b>coaxiality</b> measurement principle can separate the datum error of the <b>coaxiality</b> master theoretically and can improve the <b>coaxiality</b> measurement accuracy greatly with the common accuracy <b>coaxiality</b> master...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In {{solutions}} of {{boundary value}} problems in soil engineering, {{it is usually}} assumed that the stress and velocity fields are coaxial. Some researchers have argued the validity of this assumption. This paper investigates the influence of this simplifying assumption on the solution in these problems. The zero extension line method {{has been used for}} this investigation. The theory of the method has first been extended to the more general case of non-coaxial fields of velocity and stress in soils. A computer code has been written which can solve the given boundary value problem assuming <b>coaxiality</b> or non-coaxiality. The rotation of rough and smooth strip footings into loose and dense sands has been provided {{as an example of a}} typical boundary value problem. The analyses have been performed once with and the other without assuming <b>coaxiality.</b> A comparison of the results indicates that higher loads are required for the same deflection when <b>coaxiality</b> is assumed. It is therefore recommended to consider the non-coaxiality in the analysis if the soil really behaves so; otherwise the obtained result would not be correct...|$|E

40|$|<b>Coaxiality</b> {{between the}} {{principal}} directions of stress tensor {{and the principal}} directions of the plastic strain increment tensor is assumed in conventional plasticity models. In order to investigate <b>coaxiality,</b> or not, between these two principal directions, a series of drained tests on dry Hostun sand was carried out using a precision Hollow Cylinder Apparatus (HCA). The applied stress path includes large Principal Stress Axes Rotation (PSAR). Two of the three principal stresses are kept constant. So, among the three principal stresses, only the intermadiate principal stress which is the confining pressure (same pressure outside the hollow cylinder for internal and external lateral surfaces) changes during loading. During these tests, at different stress levels, the elastic (or quasi-elastic) properties are also investigated considering small amplitude quasi-static cycles. These small cycles are performed in two different directions by changing successively only the axial stress σzz or the shear stress σθz. The elastic experimental properties are well simulated using the DBGS hypo-elastic model, which takes into account PSAR. For each test, the elastic part of deformation is calculated using the DBGS model and removed from the global strain to focus only on the irreversible part (plastic part). Then, the principal directions of stress and the principal directions of plastic strain increment are compared. The experimental results {{show that there is}} no <b>coaxiality</b> between these directions. This observation attests the existence of a non-coaxial plasticity. In addition, coupling between coaxial and non-coaxial part is clearly shown.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the quasi-static simple shear flow of a two-dimensional assembly of cohesionless particles using discrete element method (DEM) simulations. We {{focus on the}} unsteady flow regime where the solid would experience significant evolution of stresses, mobilised shear strength and dilation. We construct the DEM model using a discretised-wall confined granular cell where the apparent boundary is allowed to dilate or contract synchronously with the confined solid. A rather uniform simple shear field is achieved across the whole assembly, which benefits rheological studies in generalising constitutive laws for continuum methods. We examine two aspects of the simple shear behaviour: macroscopic stress and strain rate evolution, particularly the non-coaxiality between the principal directions of the two; and micromechanics such as evolution of fabric. For an initially anisotropic specimen sheared under constant normal pressure, the direction of principal stress rotates towards that of the principal strain rate, gradually reducing the degree of non-coaxiality from about 45 ° to fluctuating around 0 °. The rate in approaching <b>coaxiality</b> is slower in samples with larger initial porosity, stress ratio and mean stress. Generally, a faster rate in approaching <b>coaxiality</b> in simple shear is observed in a more dilatant sample, which often shows a larger degree of mobilised fabric anisotropy, suggesting the possible important role of instantaneous internal friction angle.

An association exists between such positioning and clinical outcomes (specifically, orientation toward the interventricular septum has negative prognostic implications). Alternative commercially available LVADs are characterized by markedly different design, with potential consequences on intrathoracic fitting among individual patients. A cohort of 13 LVAD recipients (either HeartMate II-group A or Jarvik 2000 Flowmaker-group B) was evaluated. On postoperative computed tomography scans, we reconstructed the implanted LVAD (semiautomatic segmentation), defined the target mitral orifice (3 D Slicer software), and built a coordinate system to quantify the <b>coaxiality</b> of the cannula with the mitral valve axis (angles φ and θ, expressed as percentage variation from the ideal value φ = θ =  0 °). Group A presented significantly greater average percentage variation of the φ angle (significantly greater orientation of the intraventricular cannula toward the interventricular septum; 33. 2 % ±  32. 1 % versus 1. 9 % ±  0. 9 %, P =  0. 001).

This study uses the concept of deviatoric second-order work for examining the relations between stability and incremental non-coaxiality. Based on a spectral analysis of the constitutive compliance matrix, it proposes three classifications for distinguishing various degrees of incremental non-coaxiality and stability. These classifications determine the conditions {{for the existence of}} incremental <b>coaxiality</b> (i. e., colinearity of stress and strain increments), stability, instability, and stable-instable transition (i. e., positive, negative, or zero second-order deviatoric work).

For refractive optical systems with a common axis of symmetry, lens centering allows a final system assembly with high accuracy and minimal effort, but is today mostly limited to spherical optical elements only. To overcome the current restrictions, a lens centering process for one-sided aspherical lenses was investigated both in theory and practice. The deviation of the rotational aspheric axis from a reference spindle axis is measured precisely with an electronic autocollimator and an additional distance sensor at the same time.

In order to achieve a high performance of the entire optical system, the centered lens housings are machined with a diamond tool at their outer diameter, ground, and top surfaces. The feasibility of the complete process was proved by machining several aspherical lenses and measuring the final assemblies with a coordinate measuring machine. Thereby, a residual decenter < 1 µm for the aspheric vertex and a tilt < 0. 5 arcmin between the aspheric axis and the axis of symmetry of the lens housing could be verified.

This approach regards the posture best fit, which is a key activity in Measurement Aided Assembly (MAA), as a two-phase optimal problem. In the first phase, the global measurement coordinate system of digital model and shop floor is unified with minimum error based on singular value decomposition, and the current posture of components being assembly is optimally solved in terms of minimum variation of all reference points. In the second phase, the best posture of the movable component is optimally determined by minimizing multiple KCs' variation with the constraints that every KC respectively conforms to its product specification. The optimal models and the process procedures for these two-phase optimal problems based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are proposed.
