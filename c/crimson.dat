5|$|In January 2007, Nick Saban {{was hired}} as head coach, and has led the <b>Crimson</b> Tide to bowl {{appearances}} {{in each of his}} five seasons at Alabama. After defeating Colorado in the Independence Bowl, Saban led Alabama to their second BCS bowl against Utah in the Sugar Bowl. In 2009, Saban led the <b>Crimson</b> Tide to the BCS National Championship Game, and defeated Texas 37–21 to clinch the program's first national title of the BCS era. A year after Alabama defeated Michigan State in the 2011 Capital One Bowl, the <b>Crimson</b> Tide defeated LSU in the BCS National Championship Game to clinch the program's second national title of the BCS era. The following season, the <b>Crimson</b> Tide won their second consecutive BCS National Championship Game by a final score of 42–14 over Notre Dame. In their latest bowl appearance, Alabama lost to Clemson in the College Football Playoff National Championship. The loss brought Alabama's overall bowl record to 39wins, 26 losses and 3ties, placing the <b>Crimson</b> Tide in first place among all FBS schools for both bowl appearances and victories.|$|E
5|$|In {{the annual}} A-Day {{game at the}} {{conclusion}} of spring practice, the White team composed of defensive starters defeated the <b>Crimson</b> team of offensive starters 24–15. The <b>Crimson</b> team opened on offense and on their first offensive play, AJ McCarron threw an interception to Robert Lester. Each team then traded punts and the first quarter ended tied at zero. On the first offensive play of the second quarter, T. J. Yeldon was tackled in the endzone for a safety to give the <b>Crimson</b> team a 2–0 lead. The White team responded on their next possession with a 48-yard Cade Foster field goal and took a 3–2 lead before McCarron threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Christion Jones that gave the <b>Crimson</b> team a 9–3 halftime lead.|$|E

5|$|Shelley {{extended}} the <b>Crimson</b> Tide lead to 12–0 after he converted a 35-yard field goal on Alabama's first {{possession of the}} second half. He then missed a 41-yard field goal attempt wide right before he connected on a 44-yard attempt to give the <b>Crimson</b> Tide a 15–0 lead {{at the end of}} the third quarter. Midway through the fourth quarter, the LSU offense crossed the 50-yard line for the first time of the game only to be pushed back to the 50 after Dont'a Hightower sacked Jordan Jefferson on a fourth down play to give possession back to Alabama. On that possession, the <b>Crimson</b> Tide scored the only touchdown of the game on a 34-yard Trent Richardson run to make the final score 21–0.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Crimson</b> Tide {{opened the}} second half with a second missed Foster field goal, {{followed}} by each team again trading punts before the next Alabama points. The fourth <b>Crimson</b> Tide touchdown of the game came on a 42-yard McCarron pass to Cooper that extended the Alabama lead to 30–10. Tennessee advanced {{the ball to the}} <b>Crimson</b> Tide 21-yard line on their next possession before Robert Lester intercepted the second Bray pass of the evening for a touchback. Early in the fourth, Alabama extended their lead to 37–10 on a 39-yard McCarron pass to Kenny Bell. The Alabama defense then held the Volunteers on a fourth down to give the <b>Crimson</b> Tide possession at their 42-yard line. Three plays later, Yeldon scored on a 43-yard run for the final Alabama points and a 44–10 lead. Tennessee then scored the final points of the game on a 21-yard Palardy field goal that was set up after a Blake Sims fumble gave the Volunteers possession at the Alabama 24-yard line that made the final score 44–13.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} fourth batches of {{streamlined}} locomotives, Nos. 6225–6229 and 6235–6244, were painted in <b>crimson</b> lake, with banding in gold lined with vermilion and black. Nameplates had a black background. LMS shop grey was carried briefly in service on No. 6229 Duchess of Hamilton from 7 September 1938 until its return to Crewe Works later that year. It was then painted <b>crimson</b> lake and disguised as No. 6220, {{in preparation for the}} 1939 visit to the New York World's Fair. Lettering and numerals for both Caledonian blue and <b>crimson</b> lake liveries were in a newly created style of unshaded sans-serif.|$|E
5|$|Two unusual {{events have}} been recorded. Firstly, in 1940 No.6221 Queen Elizabeth had its Caledonian blue colour scheme {{replaced}} by the <b>crimson</b> lake, the only such instance. Secondly, it was often speculated that {{at some time in}} the two-year history of the Coronation Scot a <b>crimson</b> streamliner might have hauled the blue trainset. Such an event has, probably uniquely, been captured on film.|$|E

5|$|Until 1927, {{the exact}} shades of the {{national}} colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended {{on what kind of}} red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, <b>crimson,</b> due to its high price, was a color associated with the rich and the privileged. It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish cochineal, although imported alternatives were also available: kermes from the Mediterranean Basin (hence karmazyn, the Polish name of the color) and Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World. <b>Crimson</b> was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that karmazyn became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on wearing this color could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in <b>crimson</b> for their ancestors' complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, <b>crimson</b> was largely replaced with the cheaper amaranth.|$|E
5|$|With {{their victory}} over Georgia in the SEC Championship Game, Alabama {{qualified}} for the 2013 BCS National Championship Game, and against Notre Dame the <b>Crimson</b> Tide captured their third BCS Championship in four years with a 42–14 victory over the Fighting Irish. After Notre Dame won the coin toss and elected to defer until the second half, Alabama took their opening possession 82 yards in five plays and Eddie Lacy gave the <b>Crimson</b> Tide an early 7–0 lead with his 20-yard touchdown run. On the first Irish possession that followed, the <b>Crimson</b> Tide held them to a three-and-out and forced a punt. The kick was subsequently fumbled by Christion Jones and recovered by Notre Dame; however, a kick catching interference penalty was called against the Irish and gave back possession to Alabama. On the drive that ensued, the <b>Crimson</b> Tide took a 14–0 lead when AJ McCarron threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Michael Williams that capped a 10-play, 61-yard drive. After the Alabama defense forced their second punt of the game, the <b>Crimson</b> Tide responded with their third touchdown of the game.|$|E
5|$|After Bryant retired, Ray Perkins {{extended}} Alabama's consecutive {{bowl game}} streak to 25 {{years with a}} victory in the 1983 Sun Bowl. However, the streak ended when the 1984 team finished the season with a record of five wins and six losses and failed to qualify for a bowl {{for the first time in}} 26 years. The bowl absence lasted only one season as Perkins led the <b>Crimson</b> Tide to wins in both the Aloha and Sun Bowls before he resigned as head coach following the 1986 season. Bill Curry continued the bowl tradition and led the <b>Crimson</b> Tide to Hall of Fame, Sun and Sugar Bowl appearances in his three seasons as head coach. After Curry, Gene Stallings took Alabama to the Fiesta, Blockbuster, Gator, Citrus and Outback Bowls. Stallings also led the <b>Crimson</b> Tide to victory in the first Bowl Coalition national championship game with a 34–13 victory over Miami in the Sugar Bowl. In August 1995, as part of the penalty imposed by the NCAA for rules violations, Alabama was ruled ineligible to participate in the 1995 bowl season.|$|E
