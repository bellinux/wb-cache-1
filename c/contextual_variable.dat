40|$|Context-aware {{recommender}} systems (CARS) aim at im-proving {{user satisfaction}} to recommendations by tailoring these to each particular context. In this work we propose a contextual pre-filtering technique based on implicit user feedback. We {{introduce a new}} context-aware recommenda-tion approach called user micro-profiling: The user profile is split into several sub-profiles, each representing the user in a particular context. The predictions are done using these micro-profiles instead of a single user model. However, the user taste depends on the exact partition of the <b>contextual</b> <b>variable.</b> The identification of a meaningful partition of the user profile and its evaluation is a non-trivial issue, especially when using implicit feedback and a contin-uous <b>contextual</b> <b>variable.</b> We propose an off-line evaluation procedure for CARS in these conditions and evaluate our approach on a time-aware music recommendation sytem. 1...|$|E

30|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} {{realization}} of interpersonal meanings at the clause level of language. The interpersonal metafunction {{is associated with the}} <b>contextual</b> <b>variable</b> known as tenor, which refers {{to the nature of the}} roles (institutional, status, contact and sociometric) of the interactants as well as the values and attitudes (neutral or positively/negatively loaded) that the interactants bring to the domain ((Halliday & Matthiessen 2014): 32 - 33). The semantic system associated with these factors of interpersonal communication is referred to as SPEECH FUNCTION, which simultaneously realizes the three systems of MOVE, INITIATING ROLE, and COMMODITY. This semantic system creates meanings related to the <b>contextual</b> <b>variable</b> of tenor, and these meanings are realized on the stratum of lexicogrammar by means of the MOOD system. The entry condition to the system of SPEECH FUNCTION is a move in the exchange.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The paper {{examined}} {{management control}} systems (MCS) in Indonesian hospitality sector. This study examines {{the impact of}} six contextual factors at one time to determine the importance of each factor {{on the design of}} MCS. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based upon data collected through a survey sent to “star” hotels in Central Java, Indonesia. Using Chenhall (2003) design, a regression equation is run {{to examine the relationship between}} MCS and the contextual variables of environment, technology, structure, size, strategy and culture. Findings – The paper finds that higher levels of the contextual variables of technology, structure, and culture are related to more sophisticated MCS while size is related to more traditional MCS. Research limitations/implications –These findings are related to the hospitality industry in Indonesia. Future research could examine different settings (i. e. country, industry, etc) and investigate the effect of each <b>contextual</b> <b>variable</b> on the relationships between MCS and firm performance. Originality/value – The present study extends the scope of MCS system in accounting literature by testing Chenhall (2003) works on the relationship between contextual variables and MCS. It attempts to fill the gap in contingency-based studies that have previously focused on one aspect of contingency by considering six contextual factors. Furthermore, this paper also contributes to a fuller understanding of MCS practices in Indonesia and the hospitality industry and helps management in determining its most effective design.

Sample consisted of 112 subjects {{with a mean age}} of 53 years, divided between Lazio (48 %) and Sicily (52 %) e with degree of worker invalidity inclusive among 30 % and 100 %.

40|$|Purpose – Prior {{research}} {{explores the}} moderating effects {{of age and}} gender on the relationships in the comprehensive service evaluation model, but it ignores the role of contextual variables. The study aims to test the moderating effect of an important <b>contextual</b> <b>variable</b> (shopping motivation) on the service evaluation process. Design/methodology/approach – Responses were collected from 2, 727 shoppers in six retail categories (cosmetics, electronics, fashion, jewelry, telecommunication services, and department stores) using a mall-intercept approach and all the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling technique. Findings – The study finds that relationships among sacrifice, value, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions are stronger in retail categories with utilitarian vs hedonic shopping motivation. In contrast, the relationships among service quality, value, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions are stronger in hedonic vs utilitarian retail categories. Research limitations/implications – This paper uses a cross-sectional survey to test all the hypotheses, hence it cannot study actual shopping behavior in future. Moreover, it examines shopping motivation at a retail category level and not at individual shopper level. The results may also vary based on cross-cultural differences in customer expectations and perceptions. Practical implications – The findings would help retail managers to identify relevant service dimensions, to improve perceived service quality, customer satisfaction, and value for the shoppers in their stores, which in turn may lead to more favorable behavioral intentions. Originality/value – This paper offers new insights on the differences in expectations, perceptions, and evaluations of shoppers in hedonic vs utilitarian retail categories, and introduces the moderating role of shopping motivation, an important <b>contextual</b> <b>variable...</b>|$|E
