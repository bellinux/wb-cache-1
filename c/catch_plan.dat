40|$|Abstract: This {{analysis}} examines {{proposed changes}} to the management of Pacific halibut in the charter fisheries and commercial setline fisheries in International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) Regulatory Areas 2 C and 3 A in the Gulf of Alaska. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) identified a {{need to develop a}} <b>catch</b> sharing <b>plan</b> (CSP) for the charter and commercial sectors to address conservation and allocation concerns in both areas. These concerns resulted from: 1) increased harvests in the charter halibut fishery, and 2) decreased catch limits in the commercial setline fisheries. There are five proposed alternatives under consideration. The No Action alternative would continue management of the charter halibut sector in these regulatory areas under the Guideline Harvest Level (GHL) Program. Annual amendments to federal regulations have been required in Area 2 C to match the management measure(s) to constrain charter halibut harvests to the GHL. The delayed timeline for implementation of the CSP has resulted in overharvest of the GHL in Area 2 C, except for 2011 when harvest was under the GHL by 30 %. Alternative 2 is the 2008 Preferred Alternative to replace the GHL Program with a <b>catch</b> sharing <b>plan</b> (CSP) for Areas 2 C and 3 A.

40|$|The Alaska {{recreational}} charter boat {{sector has}} undergone {{significant change in}} recent years {{due in part to}} several regulatory changes in the management of the Pacific halibut sport fishery, including a limited entry program, harvest controls specific to the charter sector, and a <b>Catch</b> Sharing <b>Plan</b> (CSP) implemented during 2014. In the face of these regulatory changes, the number of active charter businesses declined from over 1, 000 in the mid- 2000 s to less than 600 in recent years. To understand the economic conditions of this sector prior to implementation of the CSP, a survey was undertaken to collect costs, earnings, and employment information from charter businesses. Sample data for the 2011, 2012, and 2013 fishing seasons were used to generate population-level estimates of fixed and variable costs, fishing and non-fishing revenues, and offshore and onshore employment. These estimates are adjusted to reflect missing data using sample weighting and nearest neighbor data imputation approaches. The adjusted population-level results suggest that in 2011 the Alaska saltwater sport fishing charter sector as a whole operated at a loss, but in 2012 and 2013, as the population of charter businesses shrank, the sector yielded an overall profit. Overall, the 3 -year period saw slight changes in employment and spending patterns by charter businesses that remained in the fishery, including a shift to using proportionately more part-time employees for on-shore work and decreasing the amount spent on charter trip expenses and cash investments in vehicles, machinery, equipment, buildings and real estate...|$|R

Our analyses show changes in these relationships as regimes shift, indicating that the trend in marine survival of pink and sockeye salmon changes on a decadal scale. In general, the climate and ocean regime from 1977 to 1988 was productive for pink and sockeye salmon. However, the regime in the 1990 s was characterized by reduced productivity for both species. The occurrence of a natural shift in the trend of pink and sockeye salmon production on a decadal scale should {{be incorporated into the}} management of Pacific salmon stocks to ensure that annual <b>catches,</b> escapements, and <b>planned</b> stock abundances are consistent with the productivity of a particular regime.

They can be basically classified as economic justifications and engineering planning and design. In this report engineering planning and design are described. This consists of following activities; 1) physical planning which covers the collection, processing and use of all relevant data with regard to natural conditions 2) hydraulic considerations as the harbour should provide safe mooring and/or berthing with only minnor wave and current action. 3) work related to fishery harbours. 4) harbour facilities - mooring, handling, transport. 5) general and technical assesment of fishery harbours which give the method of site selection by considering various aspects such as the type of fishery industry, existance of population centers and the availability of protected waters within easy reach of fishing grounds, existance of good roads etc. Breakwaters are one of a major feature in most fishery harbours and they are constructed to negate the force of incoming waves from the external sea and prevent an adverse effect of tides on water conditions inside the harbour.

It was indicated that a social marketing plan could enhance current efforts for the CATCH program.

The literature review aimed to answer the following questions: (1) What audiences (ethnic and age groups), settings, health behaviors, and behavioral science theories have been used in social marketing campaigns? (2) What features of social marketing were used (e. g. formative research, segmentation, and the marketing mix - including promotional strategies and communication channels) ? (3) What were the outcomes of the social marketing campaigns? The search aimed to identify studies that met the following inclusion criteria: (a) The study explicitly stated that social marketing was used; (b) The intervention promoted physical activity and/or healthy eating; (c) The population was children, adolescents, young adults, and/or parents; (d) Results of the intervention were available in the published literature The literature review includes studies from the past five years (2004 to 2009).

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine the immediate and the delayed effect of acute aerobic exercise on response inhibition, motor planning, and eye-hand coordination in healthy active adults. Forty healthy and active participants (10 females) with a mean age of 51. 88 ± 8. 46 years performed the Go-NoGo test (response inhibition) and the <b>Catch</b> Game (motor <b>planning</b> and eye-hand coordination) before, immediately after, and following a 30 -min recovery period in two conditions: a moderate-intensity aerobic session and a control session. In 2 -way repeated measures ANOVAs (2 treatments 3 times) followed by contrast comparisons for post hoc analyses, significant pre-post interactions – indicating improvements immediately following exercise but not following the control condition – were observed in the Go-NoGo measures: Accuracy, Reaction Time, and Performance Index, but not in the Catch Game. In the post-follow-up interaction a deterioration was observed in Performance Index, and a trend of deterioration in Accuracy and Reaction Time. The conclusion was that a single session of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise facilitates response inhibition, but not motor planning or eye-hand coordination, in middle-aged healthy active adults. On the other hand, the improvement does not last 30 min following a recovery period. Further studies are needed to examine the duration of the inhibitory control benefits and the accumulative effect of a series of acute exercise bouts, as well as to determine the brain networks and/or neurotransmitter systems most affected by the intervention. status: publishe...|$|R
