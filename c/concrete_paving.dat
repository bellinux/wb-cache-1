25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Fiala murder, Gravano continued to focus on his construction business, branching out into the lucrative <b>concrete</b> <b>paving</b> industry. New York City's cement industry was controlled by four of the Five Families, which made millions of dollars by manipulating bids and steering contracts.|$|E
25|$|Embrasures were {{available}} precast and factory produced to standard designs, but as these were {{in short supply}} some embrasures were improvised from brick or <b>concrete</b> <b>paving.</b> Embrasures were frequently fitted with a steel or concrete-asbestos shutter. From March 1941, some pillbox embrasures were fitted with a Turnbull mount: this was a metal frame that supported a medium machine gun.|$|E

25|$|Floods {{can happen}} on flat or low-lying areas when water is {{supplied}} by rainfall or snowmelt {{more rapidly than}} it can either infiltrate or run off. The excess accumulates in place, sometimes to hazardous depths. Surface soil can become saturated, which effectively stops infiltration, where the water table is shallow, such as a floodplain, or from intense rain from one or a series of storms. Infiltration also is slow to negligible through frozen ground, rock, <b>concrete,</b> <b>paving,</b> or roofs. Areal flooding begins in flat areas like floodplains and in local depressions not connected to a stream channel, because the velocity of overland flow depends on the surface slope. Endorheic basins may experience areal flooding during periods when precipitation exceeds evaporation.|$|E
25|$|Concrete {{roads are}} more fuel {{efficient}} to drive on, more reflective and last significantly longer than other paving surfaces, {{yet have a}} much smaller market share than other paving solutions. Modern-paving methods and design practices have changed the economics of <b>concrete</b> <b>paving,</b> so that a well-designed and placed concrete pavement will be less expensive on initial costs and significantly less expensive over the life cycle. Another major benefit is that pervious concrete can be used, which eliminates the need to place storm drains near the road, and reducing the need for slightly sloped roadway to help rainwater to run off. No longer requiring discarding rainwater through use of drains also means that less electricity is needed (more pumping is otherwise needed in the water-distribution system), and no rainwater gets polluted as it no longer mixes with polluted water. Rather, it is immediately absorbed by the ground.|$|E
500|$|The {{north-western}} {{boundaries of}} the site, the MSPs' building, Queensberry House and the Canongate Building reinforce the existing medieval street patterns [...] "expressing intimacy with {{the city and its}} citizens". The south-eastern aspect of the complex is extensively landscaped. Concrete [...] "branches", covered in turf and wild grass extend from the parliamentary buildings, and provide members of the public with somewhere to sit and relax. Indigenous Scottish wildflowers and plants cover much of the area, blending the Parliament's grounds with the nearby Holyrood Park and Salisbury Crags. Oak, Rowan, Lime and Cherry trees have also been planted in the grounds. Adjacent to the landscaped area of the complex, where it meets Horse Wynd, there is an open plan piazza, with bike racks, seating and external lighting shaped like rocks incorporated into <b>concrete</b> <b>paving.</b> Three distinctive water features provide the centrepiece for this area.|$|E

2500|$|In the Industrial Revolution, John Loudon McAdam (1756–1836) {{designed}} {{the first modern}} highways, using inexpensive paving material of soil and stone aggregate (macadam), and he embanked roads a few feet higher than the surrounding terrain to cause water to drain away from the surface. [...] With the development of motor transport there was an increased need for hard-topped roads to reduce washaways, bogging and dust on both urban and rural roads, originally using cobblestones and wooden paving in major western cities {{and in the early}} 20th century tar-bound macadam (tarmac) and <b>concrete</b> <b>paving</b> were extended into the countryside.|$|E

2500|$|Chewing gum is not {{water-soluble}} {{and unlike}} other confectionery {{is not fully}} consumed.

2500|$|Fisher and his {{partners}} began looking into the idea of paving the track with bricks or <b>concrete.</b> <b>Paving</b> in 1909 was still relatively new {{with only a few}} miles of public roads paved, leaving little knowledge of what would work best. Traction tests were conducted on bricks, proving they could hold up. Less than a month after the first car races, the repaving project began. Five Indiana manufacturers supplied 3.2million [...] bricks to the track. Each was hand laid over a [...] cushion of sand, then leveled and the gaps filled with mortar. At the same time, a concrete wall [...] tall was constructed in front of the main grandstand and around all four corners to protect spectators. The final brick added to the track was made of gold and laid in a special ceremony by Governor Thomas R. Marshall. Before the work was completed, locals nicknamed the track the [...] "Brickyard". Today, , or one yard, of original bricks remain exposed at the start-finish line.|$|E
