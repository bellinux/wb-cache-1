5|$|Once in the engine, the {{propellants}} {{flow through}} low-pressure fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (LPFTP and LPOTP), {{and from there}} into high-pressure turbopumps (HPFTP and HPOTP). From these HPTPs the propellants take different routes through the engine. The oxidizer is split into four separate paths: to the oxidizer heat exchanger, which then splits into the oxidizer tank pressurization and pogo suppression systems; to the low pressure oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP); to the high pressure oxidizer preburner, from which it is split into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited in the hot gas manifold and sent on to the main <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> (MCC); or directly into the main <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> (MCC) injectors.|$|E
5|$|Each engine main <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> (MCC) {{receives}} fuel-rich hot {{gas from}} a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E
5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} {{is mounted on}} the <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine {{controller}} regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
50|$|There are two <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> and {{a central}} {{precompression}} chamber. Control {{of the air}} flow between the precompression <b>chamber</b> and the <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> is made by stepped piston rods.|$|R
50|$|They {{were called}} Polyspheric or Poly engines, because they {{featured}} polyspherical-shaped (meaning “more than one sphere”) <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers.</b> These <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> were {{formed by the}} two shallow concave domes where the intake and exhaust valve seats were.|$|R

5|$|The RAF sought more thrust {{than was}} {{available}} from the Avon 100 series; in response Rolls-Royce developed the Avon 200 series engine. This was an almost wholly new design, equipped with a new compressor {{to put an end}} to surge problems, an annular <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber,</b> and an improved fuel control system. The resulting Avon 203 produced 10,000lbf (44.48kN) of thrust, and was the engine for the Hunter F.6.|$|E
5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems that supply both fuels into the <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded gasoline and ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E
5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E

25|$|Goddard {{experimented with}} many of the {{features}} of today's large rockets, such as multiple <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> and nozzles. In November, 1936, he flew the world's first rocket (L-7) with multiple chambers, hoping to increase thrust without increasing the size of a single chamber. It had four <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers,</b> reached a height of 200 feet, and corrected its vertical path using blast vanes until one chamber burned through. This flight demonstrated that a rocket with multiple <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> could fly stably and be easily guided.|$|R
5|$|The Straight Eight was {{the first}} car in series {{production}} in the United States with a straight-eight engine. The engine had a cast iron block, a detachable cast iron cylinder head, and an aluminum lower crankcase and oil pan. The crankshaft ran in three main bearings. While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine and racing engines, the model that entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead camshaft which used rockers to operate two valves per cylinder in a hemispheric <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber,</b> which increases or decreases engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.|$|E
5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E

50|$|In Episode Two {{the narrator}} states twice that the R-7 rocket has 32 engines. This {{is not entirely}} correct. The R-7 and its successors have four side {{boosters}} and a core booster. Each side booster has a single rocket engine with four <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers,</b> two vernier <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers,</b> and one set of turbopumps. The central core has a similar engine but with four vernier <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> instead of two. This makes total of 32 chambers, not engines. In the scene where Glushko is supposedly testing the clustering scheme, only one engine is shown.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} period of Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, kilns with a {{controlled}} atmosphere {{were used for}} pottery production. These kilns were constructed with two separate chambers—the <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> and the filling chamber— separated by a grate. Temperatures in the <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> could reach 1000–1100°C but were usually maintained at around 900°C to achieve a uniform and complete firing of vessels.|$|E
25|$|A turbocharger, or colloquially turbo, is a turbine-driven forced {{induction}} {{device that}} increases an internal combustion engine's efficiency and power output by forcing extra {{air into the}} <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber.</b> This improvement over a naturally aspirated engine's power output {{is due to the}} fact that the compressor can force more air—and proportionately more fuel—into the <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> than atmospheric pressure (and for that matter, ram air intakes) alone.|$|E
