40|$|Abstract. We present two {{algorithms}} to list certain {{classes of}} monomino-domino <b>coverings</b> which {{conform to the}} tatami restric-tion; no four tiles meet. Our methods exploit structural features of tatami <b>coverings</b> {{in order to create}} the lists in O(1) time per cov-ering. This is faster than known methods for generating certain classes of matchings in bipartite graphs. We discuss tatami <b>coverings</b> of n × n grids with n monominoes and v vertical dominoes, as well as tatami <b>coverings</b> of a two-way infinitely-wide strip of constant height, subject to the constraint that they have a finite number of non-trivial structural “features”. These two classes are representative of two differing structural characterisations of tatami <b>coverings</b> which may be adapted to count other classes of tatami <b>coverings</b> or locally restricted match-ings, such as tatami <b>coverings</b> of rectangles. 1...|$|R

5|$|In 1996, German {{mathematician}} Petra Gummelt {{demonstrated that}} a <b>covering</b> (so called to {{distinguish it from}} a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed. The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the <b>covering</b> rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a <b>covering</b> into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling {{can be obtained by}} inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.|$|E

The algorithm uses a quasi-Newton method with BFGS secant update {{to minimize the}} uncovered area by moving the circles. The radius of the circles is further adapted to find locally optimal <b>coverings,</b> and the algorithm is applied repeatedly to random initial configurations. The structures of the <b>coverings</b> are determined and the coordinates of each circle are calculated with high precision using a mathematical model for an idealized physical structure consisting of tensioned bars and frictionless pin joints.

40|$|Abstract: A {{method for}} {{determining}} consensus of hierarchical incomplete ordered partitions and <b>coverings</b> of sets {{is presented in}} this chapter. Incomplete ordered partitions and <b>coverings</b> are often used in expert information analysis. These structures should be useful when an expert has to classify elements of a set into given classes, but referring to several elements {{he does not know}} to which classes they should belong. The hierarchical ordered partition is a more general structure than incomplete ordered partition. In this chapter we present definitions of the notion of hierarchical incomplete ordered partitions and <b>coverings</b> of sets. The distance functions between hierarchical incomplete ordered partitions and <b>coverings</b> are defined. We present also algorithms of consensus determining for a finite set of hierarchical incomplete ordered partitions and <b>coverings...</b>|$|R
