5|$|Beginning in 1847 {{and lasting}} until 1996, the Canadian government, in {{partnership}} with the Catholic Church, ran 130 residential boarding schools across Canada for Aboriginal <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> were forcibly taken from their homes. While the schools were said to educate, they were plagued by under-funding, disease, and abuse.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that <b>children</b> <b>who</b> received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age <b>children</b> <b>who</b> were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the <b>children</b> <b>who</b> watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, <b>children</b> <b>who</b> watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as <b>children</b> <b>who</b> watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E

Sensory integration (SI) dysfunction appears to be a productive explanation for these problems (American Occupational Therapy Association, 1997; Case-Smith & Bryon, 1999). Moreover, SI therapy seems a logical approach to addressing these issues...|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, clinicians Robert Krell and Leslie Rabkin {{identified}} {{three types of}} replacement child: the [...] "haunted" [...] <b>child,</b> <b>who</b> lives in a family overwhelmed by guilt and silence, the [...] "bound" [...] <b>child,</b> <b>who</b> is incomparably precious and sometimes over-protected, and the [...] "resurrected" [...] <b>child,</b> <b>who</b> is treated as a reincarnation of the dead sibling.

5|$|The Elementary Education Act 1880 {{insisted on}} {{compulsory}} attendance from 5–10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, {{as it was}} more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance Officers often visited the homes of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children {{under the age of}} 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard; employers of these <b>children</b> <b>who</b> weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893, which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi {{has increased dramatically}} since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death {{of at least one}} parent due to HIV/AIDS. Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children at increased risk of becoming double orphans, or <b>children</b> <b>who</b> have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS. Older <b>children</b> <b>who</b> have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings. Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|The terms {{attachment}} disorder, attachment problems, and attachment therapy, although increasingly used, have no clear, specific, or consensus definitions.

25|$|Gardner {{argues that}} there is a wide range of {{cognitive}} abilities, but that there are only very weak correlations among them.

The <b>child</b> <b>who</b> takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.|$|R
