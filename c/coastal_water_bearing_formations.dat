Because of the complex geologies like faults, fractured zones, karst cavities as well as <b>water</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>formations,</b> the stability and safety of tunnels have been challenging topics in {{the construction}} process. In this regard, the advance knowledge of the location, size, and spatial information of the uncertainties ahead of the face {{is very important to}} the contractors. In this paper, by using the Tunneling Seismic Prediction (TSP) technique, site experiments are performed to predict hazardous formations ahead of face in a railway tunnel. Through interpretation of the testing data, the wave velocities and the mechanical parameters of the surrounding rock are obtained, and the faults/fractures are recognized. The study shows that compared to time-consuming core drilling method, the wave reflection based TSP method can predict major uncertain formations in long range ahead of the face in short time.

Most of the boreholes or shallow wells are confined to upper aquifers which are exposed to contamination from all sorts of wastewaters and run-off from agricultural field etc. Water quality monitoring from these ground water sources remained irregular, as main focus was on surface water quality monitoring.

30|$|The Gwalior basin {{is located}} on the northwestern fringe of the Bundelkhand massif and is intracratonic in nature, and the {{complete}} lithological unit lies on the Bundelkhand granite which comprises basal arenaceous Par formation which is overlaid by a sequence of volcanic sediments of the Morar formation. The Gwalior group (which dips in due north) shows continuity and similarity with the Bijawar group (Singh et al. 2011). The basic structure is quite similar as the base is made up of quartzite; the shallow water conditions are characteristics of ferruginous shale with chert and jasper; and transgression follows after the rapid development of the basin formation. In few parts of the basin, the Gwalior group shows fine or coarse doleritic sills and dykes. The hard rocks of the region comprise sandstone and shale as they belong to the Archaean group to Precambrian group; however, the doleritic dykes are recent alluvium deposits where granite is the base rock of the study area. By the regional geological map of the area which has been prepared based on the satellite images and geological maps, the Gwalior basin shows much of the Morar formation shale with lower region of Par formation of sandstone. Surrounding the region is the Kaimur group sandstone and Bundelkhand granite. The chief groundwater deposits in the region are formed by the weathered shale zones, alluvial deposits and sandstone forming a coarse- or medium-grained unconsolidated aggregation. The  thickness of aquifer formation  increases to the northern portion of the watershed with  three major <b>water</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>formation</b> at 100 m depth. The fracturing, openness, size of the fracture and the interconnection nature between the fractures dominate the water yielding capacity of the rocks.

These comprise basal arenaceous Par formation overlain by volcano-sedimentary sequences of Morar formation consisting of ferruginous shale with bands of chert, jasper and limestone. The predominant rocks comprise sandstone, shale, quartzite, doleritic dykes and alluvium. The thickness of this weathered zone is generally greater in the northern portion.

The Vanathavillu basin situated 18 km north of Puttalum, covering an area of approximately 80 sq. km has been studied, using a mathematical model based on an implicit finite difference scheme. The study area situated in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, receives a seasonal rainfall of about 900 mm/year, the most of which falls during the months of October to December. In the Vanathavillu base in there are essentially two <b>water</b> <b>bearing</b> formations: - the miocene sedimentary strata, - the quarternary deposits which overlie the miocene strata. (referred as Moongil Aru formation) Moongil Aru formation consists {{of a series of}} clays and silts which partly confines the miocene formation. The piezo-metric levels in the miocene aquifer is lower than the phreatic surface by up to 30 m in the central parts of the region. In the north the piezometric levels are slightly higher than the phreatic surface. The two <b>water</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>formations</b> are interdependent as leakage takes place {{in and out of the}} Miocene formation. The model was developed only for the miocene formation and the water table elevation in the Moongil Aru formation assumed constant. The miocene formation is bounded in the east by basement rock outcrops which are relatively impermeable. To the west a fault exists which runs along the coast line. This fault restricts the flow in westerly direction. It is believed that two minor faults exists along two drainage paths of Kala Oya and Moongil Aru. 'The piezometric levels. {{in the north}}s suggest that the aquifer discharges into Kala Oya which could be treated as a constant head boundary. In the south the flow directions is entirely towards north. The area has been studied by the Irrigation Dept. and the Water Resources Board of Sri Lanka. On the basis of these investigations aquifer parameters, recharge and abstraction from the limestone aquifer have been estimated. Development plans have been prepared on the basis of these estimates. The purpose of the present model investigation was to access reliability of this estimation and also to provide a tool for planning future development and management of this valuable water resource. A number of model runs with different sets of data representing aquifer parameters, boundaries and flow were made. The results were compared with an available two year record of piezometric levels in the limestone aquifer. Computations were made with one layer model as well as with a simple two layer model. A single layer model with constant inflows or a simple two layer model with water table elevation treated as a constant adequately describe the behavior of the aquifer under the presence level of abstraction. But the behavior of the aquifer with highly increased abstraction can only be model adequately by a two layer model representing both unconfined and semiconfined aquifers together...|$|R

An evaluation {{has been carried out}} of the groundwater system in Bahrain. It has involved the collection of water samples from all the <b>water</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>formations</b> to study the quality of the groundwater. Each water sample was tested physically, chemically, and bacteriologically. Additionally, the five day biochemical oxygen demand test and hydrogen sulphide were detected. The period of the actual sampling and testing extended from mid- 1990 to the beginning of 1992. The results obtained have been compared to the results of an earlier study conducted between 1978 and 1979. The investigation has also involved a statistical analysis of the variations in the sub-surface water table level in each hydrogeologic formation. The piezometric levels have been collected from monitoring boreholes/ standpipes. The levels obtained extended from the beginning of 1980 when the earliest recording started up to the end of 1991. Bahrain abstracts its fresh water from five aquifers which in descending order are the Sanad, the Alat, the Khobar, the Rus, and the Umm-Er-Radhuma Aquifers. The quality of the groundwater appears to be deteriorating. The excessive groundwater abstraction has caused the encroachment of the sea into all the sub-surface waters. As the waters become saline, they are expected to become unsuitable for human consumption and for irrigation. The deeper aquifers are believed to consist of high values of the hydrogen sulphide because the deeper geological formations contain oil rich in sulphur. land spring water is expected not to be safe bacteriologically because it is exposed to the atmosphere unlike the other boreholes in the various aquifers. The water table levels have been changing in each aquifer. The groundwater levels in the Sanad Aquifer, which is the shallowest geological formation, are expected to rise in the future in areas where the natural drainage is obstructed. This is related to the sea coast reclamation area. The rise is expected to reduce inland depending on the application of surface irrigation as well as the possible leakages from the services systems. About two kilometres south from the original shore, around Buddayya Road, the Sanad Aquifer's water table {{has been shown to be}} falling. This fall is expected to be due to overpumping from the groundwater system. Apart from the Sanad Aquifer, the piezometric levels of the underlying aquifers are expected to fall with time. Once again the fall is due to excessive groundwater abstraction. The study concludes by re-presenting the causes for the water table rise in the near-surface Sanad Aquifer and discusses the possible geotechnical consequences. It further produces some possible solutions to control the rise of the water table level...|$|R

To study these microbial assemblages and to assess any modifications that {{may be caused by}} industrial practices, the bacterial and archaeal communities in waters from four Algerian oilfields were described and compared. Three different types of samples were analyzed: production waters from flooded wells, production waters from non-flooded wells and injection waters used for flooding (<b>water</b> - <b>bearing</b> <b>formations).</b> Microbial communities of production and injection waters appeared to be significantly different. From a quantitative point of view, injection waters harbored roughly ten times more microbial cells than production waters. Bacteria dominated in injection waters, while Archaea dominated in production waters. Statistical analysis based on the relative abundance and bacterial community composition (BCC) revealed significant differences between production and injection waters at both OTUs 0. 03 and phylum level. However, no significant difference was found between production waters from flooded and non-flooded wells, suggesting that most of the microorganisms introduced by the injection waters were unable to survive in the production waters. Furthermore, a Venn diagram generated to compare the BCC of production and injection waters of one flooded well revealed only 4 % of shared bacterial OTUs. Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial sequences indicated that Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria were the main classes in most of the water samples. Archaeal sequences were only obtained from production wells and each well had a unique archaeal community composition, mainly belonging to Methanobacteria, Methanomicrobia, Thermoprotei and Halobacteria classes.

In general, water content of near-surface strata is relatively low before mining, influenced by coal mining, water contents of near-surface formations decrease after the formations begin to loose, after long-term (10  months) recovery, fractures of the near-surface strata become more developed and conductivity increases, fissure water of near-surface strata filtrates downward and water content increases. Influenced by coal mining, resistivity of far-surface aquifer {{increases in the}} mining process, in post-mining deposition stable period, local ground water of the aquifer infiltrates, resistivity decreases, and its <b>water</b> <b>bearing</b> basically recovers to the pre-mining state. <b>Water</b> <b>bearing</b> of coal roof become worse during mining. This indicates that <b>water</b> <b>bearing</b> self-healing capability of near-surface strata is higher, while that of roof strata adjacent to the coal seam mined is lower.|$|R

30|$|The {{intention}} {{of this study}} was to appraise the spatial and temporal variations in the physico-chemical parameters of <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> of Rameswaram Island, Gulf of Mannar Marine Biosphere Reserve, south India, using multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, factor analysis and principal component analysis. Spatio-temporal variations among the physico-chemical parameters are observed in the <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> of Gulf of Mannar, especially during northeast and post monsoon seasons. It is inferred that the high loadings of pH, temperature, suspended particulate matter, salinity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll a, nutrient species of nitrogen and phosphorus strongly determine the discrimination of <b>coastal</b> <b>water</b> quality. Results highlight the important role of monsoonal variations to determine the <b>coastal</b> <b>water</b> quality around Rameswaram Island.|$|R

Based on the average data of three sets of sediment traps, the potency of sedimentation rate in Banjir Kanal Timur Semarang <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> was 6. 10 cm/month. The result did not reflect the fact of the field condition. Based on the correction made on the input of suspended discharge into Banjir Kanal Timur Semarang <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> and the average area of sediment distribution, the potency of sediment rate in Banjir Kanal Timur Semarang <b>coastal</b> <b>water</b> during transition of dry season to rainy season was 0. 35 cm/month...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} {{of the relationship between}} chlorophyll concentration and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SICF) in <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> and shelf sea waters is explored using advanced radiative transfer simulations and recent estimates of material-specific inherent optical properties obtained from <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> using state-of-the-art in-situ instrumentation. The aim is to systematically analyze the influence of non-algal materials on SICF signals and determine the potential performance of the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer fluorescence line height algorithm for <b>coastal</b> <b>waters.</b> If the light field is subject to non-algal influence, then so is the chlorophyll fluorescence signal, which means that users of remote sensing products based on SICF {{should be aware of the}} potential influence of nonalgal materials and be careful in interpreting such products from turbid <b>coastal</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|R

The multi-year expedition data are the base for understanding the optico-chemico properties of the <b>coastal</b> <b>waters.</b> The <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> are characterized by low transparencies, resuspension events and high cDOM concentrations. The Laptev Sea Region has become an ESA CoastColour investigation site to support the use of the ground data. Ocean Colour MERIS data from 2008 on to 2010 are processed using the VISAT Beam Case 2 Regional Processor (C 2 R). The expedition data show that Siberian Arctic <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> are highly specific in terms of high cDOM background concentrations. Therefore, all remote sensing chlorophyll products are overestimated by an order of magnitude due to the high cDOM concentrations. The optical C 2 R parameters such as absorption, attenuation and the first attenuation depth are of immediate value to show the hydrographic dynamics of the Laptev Sea <b>coastal</b> <b>water...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{definition}} of <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> {{in relation to}} EU environmental legislation was clearly stated in the Water Framework Directive. In compliance with this Directive, most of the EU Member States delineated their coastal waters¿ boundaries. However, these delineations are not as complete and homogeneous as could be expected. A clear identification of European <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> boundaries is crucial {{for the implementation of}} the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which depend on an accurate ecological/environmental assessment of those waters. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a comprehensive and unambiguous delimitation of European <b>coastal</b> <b>waters.</b> This report aims at bridging this gap providing a pan-European mapping of <b>coastal</b> <b>waters,</b> which cover 553, 817 km 2 in 30 seaside countries, 340, 524 km 2 of which pertain to the 22 EU Member States connected to the sea. For this purpose, a comprehensive geographical analysis of the national baselines and transitional waters distribution was performed. A pan-European baseline of 63, 340 km was delineated as a basis for the European <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> delimitation. The European <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> identified in this work show significant differences with the available national declarations (almost 12 % of the compared area), the latter defining an additional area of 29, 337 km 2 with respect to the former. The largest deviations seem to be due to misinterpretations of the {{definition of}} <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> in the Water Framework Directive, although a number of one-sided national modifications to that definition are also observed. This work provides the geographical basis for a full consultation process and discussion about this subject. Our recommendations include setting a clear geographical limit between the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive jurisdiction, revise the possible exemptions in the definition of <b>coastal</b> <b>waters,</b> and discuss their consequences in the assessment of ecological/environmental status.
