50|$|The ground {{reaction}} force creates external moments on the joints of the lower-limb. Activation of muscles and other passive connective tissues (e.g., ligaments, tendons) create {{what is known}} as internal moments that <b>control</b> <b>joint</b> motions. When a joint motion occurs {{in the direction of a}} muscle’s action it is concentrically acting. If a joint motion occurs in the opposite direction of a muscle’s action then the muscle is eccentrically acting. Therefore, the magnitude of the internal moment reasonably matches the described muscular activations.|$|E

40|$|Pedestrian {{concrete}} pavements are commonly constructed of continuous slabs with simple <b>control</b> <b>joints.</b> The purpose of simple <b>control</b> <b>joints</b> {{is to prevent}} unplanned cracking in the pavements due to changes in their environment. However, these joints {{do not have a}} load transfer mechanism and therefore the movement of the concrete slab panels often results in a differential vertical displacement at the joint when the pedestrian {{concrete pavements}} are affected by tree root invasion or soil movement. This differential vertical displacement in adjoining slabs creates a major tripping hazard to pedestrians. In this paper, a simple and low cost concrete shear connector is proposed and its capability for minimizing the tripping hazards is investigated through experiments and finite element analysis (FEA) simulations...|$|R

AOC 3 Group/FOMA had two RAF subordinates, Air Commodore Harrier (for all the RAF Harriers and FAA Sea Harriers) and Air Commodore Maritime (for the Nimrods and SAR helicopters).

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that a robot can be linearized and {{decoupled}} by suitable non-linear transformations, current industrial practice is independent <b>joint</b> <b>control</b> with fixed linear control laws. This is mainly due to the computational complexity and the lack of robustness results for such nonlinear schemes. As the joint dynamics vary with the position and speed of the <b>controlled</b> <b>joint</b> and the other joints as well as with changes in the mass of the payload, the design of fixed linear joint controllers is a robust control problem. In recent years, frequency domain methods have been proposed as the most suitable tools for the analysis and synthesis of robust control systems (1 - 4). In this paper, we report of the identification of the dynamics of one joint of an industrial robot using frequency domain methods. This approach yields not only a nominal model for controller design purposes but also information about the uncertainty in the system dynamics. From a frequency domain description of the deviations of the dynamic behaviour from the nominal model, the attainable performance of the <b>controlled</b> <b>joint</b> can be estimated...|$|R

40|$|Pedestrian {{concrete}} pavements (sidewalks) are usually made of continuous slabs with simple <b>control</b> <b>joints</b> at a specified interval. Simple <b>control</b> <b>joints</b> such as breaking score lines or saw cuts are created on the pedestrian {{concrete pavements}} mainly to relieve stresses resulting from friction {{and also to}} avoid displacement/unplanned cracking. However, these joints have no load transfer mechanism and therefore the concrete slab panels may have different vertical movements at the joint when the pavements are affected by tree root invasion or by soil movement. Such differential vertical movements at adjoining slabs can create tripping hazards to pedestrians. This paper presents the use of ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM) rubber and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) joiners for minimizing such tripping hazards. An experimental investigation for evaluating stepping displacements of concrete pavements connected by EPDM rubber and PVC joiners has been undertaken. Nonlinear finite element analysis models using ABAQUS have also been developed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work {{proposed}} a closed-loop torque control strategy of functional electrical stimulation (FES) {{with the aim}} of obtaining an accurate, safe and robust FES system. Generally, FES control systems are faced with the challenge of how to deal with time-variant muscle dynamics due to physiological and biochemical factors (such as fatigue). The degraded muscle force needs to be compensated in order to ensure the accuracy of the motion restored by FES. Another challenge concerns the fact that implantable sensors are unavailable to feedback torque information for FES in humans. As FES-evoked electromyography (EMG) represents the activity of stimulated muscles, and also enables joint torque prediction as presented in our previous studies, here we propose an EMG-feedback predictive controller of FES to <b>control</b> <b>joint</b> torque adaptively. EMG feedback contributes to taking the activated muscle state in the FES torque control system into account. The nature of the predictive controller facilitates prediction of the muscle mechanical response and the system can therefore <b>control</b> <b>joint</b> torque from EMG feedback and also respond to time-variant muscle state changes. The control performance, fatigue compensation and aggressive control suppression capabilities of the proposed controller were evaluated and discussed through experimental and simulation studies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Active Electromechanical Compliance (AEC) {{system that was}} developed for the Jau-JPL anthropomorphic robot. The AEC system imitates the functionality of the human muscle's secondary function, which is to <b>control</b> the <b>joint's</b> stiffness: AEC is implemented through servo <b>controlling</b> the <b>joint</b> drive train's stiffness. The control strategy, <b>controlling</b> compliant <b>joints</b> in teleoperation, is described. It enables automatic hybrid position and force control through utilizing sensory feedback from joint and compliance sensors. This compliant control strategy is adaptable for autonomous robot control as well. Active compliance enables dual arm manipulations, human-like soft grasping by the robot hand, and opens the way to many new robotics applications...|$|R
40|$|SummaryLesions {{induced by}} transecting the cranial {{cruciate}} ligament in two surgical models of osteoarthritis (OA) in mature, male, cross-bred dogs were compared {{by using an}} established grading system and alternatives. Previously, we relied on evaluations of lesions in articular cartilage on femurs alone. No statistically {{significant differences were found}} between grades for lesions in cartilage when either treated or <b>control</b> <b>joints</b> were compared by surgical method. Because the Pond-Nuki method yielded statistically significant differences between grades for lesions affecting treated and control femurs or tibias, and for some parameters indicative of synovitis, we preferred this method of surgery. Although by using the medial arthrotomy method of surgery, we were able to destabilize the joint in a more consistent manner, significant differences between treated and <b>control</b> <b>joints</b> were found for lesions on tibias, but not femurs, a frequent site for OA in humans. Suggestions are made for enhancing the surgical models and for a more holistic approach to evaluating joints morphologically...|$|R
