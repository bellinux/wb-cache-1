50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Ballard made an {{application}} for a second Canadian Football League team to be based in Toronto, to play at Varsity Stadium. At the time, the CFL still consisted of two autonomous conferences. Ballard's application would have required the unanimous consent of the four Eastern Football <b>Conference</b> <b>owners</b> to have been approved under the rules in effect at the time. In the West, CFL teams had come under significant pressure resulting from the introduction of WHA franchises in the four largest Western markets, therefore Western Football Conference teams were generally supportive of Ballard's efforts to become a CFL owner. However, hostility to Ballard's overture from the Toronto Argonauts (then owned by Ballard's former partner John Bassett) ensured it never went anywhere.|$|R

5000|$|Frank Stronach first {{proposed}} {{the idea for}} the race during the Thoroughbred <b>Owners</b> <b>Conference</b> at Gulfstream in January 2016.

The timing also makes it possible for a horse to run one last race before retiring to stud, as the North American breeding season begins in mid-February.

40|$|This {{special issue}} of "Corporate Governance" {{is devoted to the}} concept of "{{universal}} ownership" (UO) and grows out of a <b>conference</b> of universal <b>owners,</b> institutional investors, investment professionals and academics held in April 2006 at Saint Mary's College of California, under the sponsorship of the Center for the Study of Fiduciary Capitalism (A report of the conference is available at [URL]). Four of the seven articles in this issue are based on papers presented at the conference, while an additional three (by Lydenberg, Syse and Gjessing, and Lippman "et[*]al. ") were written specifically for this issue. The conference purposefully developed a practitioners' perspective on universal ownership and these articles reflect this orientation, although each article in its own way breaks new ground which academics, policy researchers and practitioners can and should develop.

5000|$|The ABA {{expansion}} franchise, {{who would}} be based in Benton Harbor, Michigan but also claim [...] "twin city" [...] St. Joseph as home, was announced during a July 2006 new <b>conference</b> by <b>owner</b> Sidney Brooks (a travel agency owner in Chicago).The squad was assembled {{with a series of}} tryout camps in October, with a number of former Benton Harbor High School alumni selected for the team, such as Robert Whaley, Correy Childs, Prentice McGruder, Curtis McFall and Bryan Doss, with Peter Jackson as coach and Corey Sterling as general manager.The Twin City Ballers played their first ever game on 7 November 2006, beating the Peoria Kings 117-110 at home.The team reportedly drew [...] "about 800" [...] for each of its first three home games in Benton Harbour High School's Farnum Gym but the numbers dwindled rapidly (with an announced paying crowd of 65 for a late December game) and the team struggled financially after not securing sponsors (a reported $60,000 deal with Whirlpool Corporation did not come to fruition, allegedly because of poor attendance).Those financial problems led Brooks to lower the player's salaries (of between $175 and $300 per game) to $100 per game, with players quitting in response which saw the Ballers play a game on 30 December with only eight players.The organisation then cancelled a number of games and went on hiatus, training in Chicago's Lindbloom Park whilst Brooks looked to leave Benton Harbour (citing the lack of a local following) to move to Coloma, Michigan as the Southwest Michigan Ballers, nearly all the players (including all those from Benton Harbour High School), Peter Jackson and Corey Sterling had left and Jackson's assistant Johnell Williams was named as the new coach.The Coloma School Board ultimately refused to allow the team to use Coloma High School's gym, with the Ballers - who only had Remington Stewart and Quinnel Brown left from the initial roster - then playing all their games away, travelling by bus to Quebec City to play and lose two games in early February 2007.Though Brooks announced plans to play in Coloma, Covert or Watervliet in 2007-08, the team folded soon after, finishing its incomplete 2006-07 season with a 6-19 record.|$|R
5000|$|The rivalry {{carried over}} to the newly formed American Football Conference in 1970 as the two teams and then-Baltimore Colts joined the former American Football League teams in the conference {{as part of the}} AFL-NFL merger. The newly merged league needed to move three teams from the [...] "old" [...] NFL to the AFC so that the two {{conferences}} had 13 teams. (The rest of the [...] "old" [...] NFL teams joined the newly formed National Football Conference.) The NFL tried to get the Steelers to the new <b>conference,</b> but then-Steelers <b>owner</b> Art Rooney initially refused. However, Rooney reconsidered after then-Browns owner Art Modell volunteered the Browns to shift to the AFC, partly because the NFL had offered $3 million as an incentive to move but also on account of the potential for an intrastate rivalry with the AFL's newest team, the Cincinnati Bengals. Not only were the Bengals in the same state as the Browns, but they had been established by Browns founder Paul Brown, whom Modell had a lingering feud with. The financial boost combined with the prospect of losing his most lucrative division rival quickly persuaded Rooney to join Modell in the AFC in order to continue their own rivalry, although the team did lose its rivalry with the cross-state Philadelphia Eagles as a result. Somewhat ironically, although they play in the same state as the Browns, like the Browns, the Bengals currently view the Steelers as their biggest rival.|$|R
