40|$|We analyse <b>the</b> {{predictions}} <b>of</b> both Higgs and top {{masses in}} a generic MSSM satisfying gauge-coupling unification, radiative electroweak symmetry breaking, {{with a natural}} (non-splitted) spectrum of soft-breaking terms, and an arbitrary soft-breaking scale (above a few TeV). This procedure allows us to identify a relatively narrow SUSY-allowed region in the $(m_h, m_t) $ plane. We argue that <b>the</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measured</b> values <b>of</b> Higgs and top masses with this SUSY-allowed region is not less surprising than the corresponding compatibility with the narrow SM metastability region.

40|$|The Standard Model's {{accidental}} and anomaly-free currents: B-L, L_e-L_μ, L_e-L_τ, and L_μ-L_τ, {{could be}} indicative of a hidden gauge structure beyond the Standard Model. Additionally, neutrino masses can be generated by a dimension- 5 operator that generically breaks all of these symmetries. It is therefore important to investigate <b>the</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> a gauged U'(1) and neutrino phenomenology. We consider gauging each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symmetries above with a minimal extended matter content. This includes the Z', an order parameter to break the U'(1), and three right-handed neutrinos. We find all but B-L require additional matter content to explain <b>the</b> <b>measured</b> neutrino oscillation parameters. We also discuss <b>the</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measured</b> neutrino textures with a non-thermal dark matter production mechanism involving <b>the</b> decay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Z'.

40|$|Member States <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Union have {{tackled the}} {{financial}} crisis by adopting rescue measures such as guarantees on debt and capital injections into banks facing difficulty, some of which even went bankrupt. These measures are, however, bound by the state aid rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU for <b>the</b> sake <b>of</b> competition in <b>the</b> Internal Market. Member states are therefore required to report rescue <b>measures</b> to <b>the</b> European Commission beforehand {{in order to obtain}} its approval. In response to a deterioration in the crisis, the Commission issued temporarily applicable rules in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> communications, <b>the</b> first one <b>of</b> which is known as the Banking Communication.

40|$|When {{competition}} authorities investigate {{anti-competitive conduct}} of undertakings, {{they can be}} confronted with state measures that have contributed to this conduct. In the CIF judgment <b>the</b> Court <b>of</b> Justice (‘Court’) has held that national competition authorities (‘NCAs’) have to disapply such state measures, {{if they are in}} breach of EU law. Although the CIF judgement seems to be quite spectacular, the question arises whether the judgment has actually increased <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> NCAs on government agencies and <b>the</b> regulatory <b>measures</b> they take. This is <b>the</b> main subject <b>of</b> this doctoral thesis. NCAs can only exercise their power to disapply state <b>measures</b> in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> procedures on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> Article 101 and 102 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty on <b>the</b> Functioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Union (TFEU). One could say that <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> NCAs to disapply state measures is an ‘implicit’ power which is ancillary to their ‘explicit’ power to enforce Article 101 and 102 TFEU. The CIF judgement is based on the Fratelli Costanzo judgment, where it has been established that administrative authorities have to disapply state measures that are incompatible with EU law. This presupposes that an administrative authority ‘bumps into’ a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national government when exercising the powers it has explicitly been entrusted with (<b>the</b> enforcement <b>of</b> Article 101 and 102 TFEU). The CIF judgment does not entitle NCAs to act solely against state <b>measures,</b> like <b>the</b> Commission can when initiating an infringement procedure against a Member State (Article 258 TFEU). Although the CIF judgement focuses on <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> NCAs to disapply state measure that do not leave any room for competition (and consequently form a ‘legal shield’ against enforcement actions of NCAs), it is clear that NCAs also have the power to disapply state measures that do leave (some) room for competition. This may seem surprising because <b>the</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> such <b>measures</b> with EU law is (strictly speaking) not relevant for the question whether the NCA concerned has the power to act on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> Article 101 and 102 TFEU. If there is room for competition, NCAs can apply these provisions regardless of whether any state measure that may have contributed to <b>the</b> anti-competitive conduct <b>of</b> <b>the</b> undertakings in question, is compatible with EU law. NCAs are nevertheless competent to disapply such state measures, even if there is room for competition and – as a result - Article 101 and 102 TFEU apply. In such cases <b>the</b> ‘disapplication’ <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state <b>measure</b> is not a necessary step for the NCA in order to enable itself to enforce Article 101 or 102 TFEU, but merely a ‘legal opinion’ (or perhaps an obiter dictum) with respect to <b>the</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state <b>measure</b> with EU law. <b>The</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CIF judgment is not voluntary, but mandatory for NCAs. Indeed, the Court has held that NCAs have a duty to disapply state measures that are contrary to EU law. This is likely to have increased <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> NCAs on regulatory measures of national government agencie...|$|R

Angular measurements had been carried through that evaluated five variables: the maxillary position in relation to the anterior cranial base (SNMx), the mandibular position in relation to the anterior cranial base (SNMd), the intermaxillary distance difference to intermaxillary referring to Nasion (MxNMd), the mandible growth direction – Y-axis angle (NSGn) and the tegumental facial profile convexity (G'SnPog'). The averages and shunting line-standard for each variable were described and statistical tests were applied, that evaluated <b>the</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obtained <b>measures</b> as well as the correlations between these and the gestational ages. The data had been analyzed with statistical software SPSS 15, 0 (Chicago, IL, the USA) and Excel for Windows 2007 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, the USA). The results had indicated that three, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five studied variables, had presented statistical significant correlations with <b>the</b> advance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gestational age. From the results, it was concluded that, during the observed fetal period, the mandible grew, on average, more than what the maxilla, having as reference the anterior cranial base. There was a reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intermaxilar sagittal difference and <b>the</b> convexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tegumental facial profile.

Este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar medidas cefalométricas fetais, no plano médio sagital, a partir de imagens geradas por ultra-sonografia, de forma a possibilitar uma melhor compreensão do mecanismo de crescimento pré-natal. A amostra transversal constituiu-se de 120 imagens ultra-sonográficas de fetos saudáveis de ascendência caucasiana, em gestações únicas, no período entre a 17 ª e a 35 ª semana VIU. Foram realizadas medições angulares que avaliaram cinco variáveis: a posição maxilar em relação à base anterior do crânio (SNMx), a posição mandibular em relação à base anterior do crânio (SNMd), a diferença intermaxilar com referência em Násio (MxNMd), a direção de crescimento da mandíbula – ângulo do eixo Y (NSGn) e a convexidade do perfil facial tegumentar (G’SnPog’). Descreveram-se as médias e desvios-padrão para cada variável e aplicados testes estatísticos que avaliaram a reprodutibilidade das medidas obtidas assim como as correlações entre estas e as idades gestacionais. Os dados foram analisados com o software SPSS 15. 0 (Chicago, IL, USA) e Excel para Windows 2007 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). Os resultados indicaram que três, das cinco variáveis estudadas, apresentaram correlações estatisticamente significantes com o avanço da idade gestacional. A partir dos resultados obtidos, conclui-se que, durante o período fetal observado, a mandíbula cresceu, em média, mais do que a maxila, tendo como referência a base anterior do crânio.
