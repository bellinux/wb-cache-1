40|$|Comprehensive {{analyses}} of long-term (1977 – 2003) small-mammal abundance data from western Finland showed that populations of Microtus voles (field voles M. agrestis and sibling voles M. rossiaemeridionalis) voles, bank (Clethrionomys glareolus) and <b>common</b> <b>shrews</b> (Sorex araneus) fluctuated synchronously in 3 year population cycles.

Synchrony among Microtus and bank voles appeared additionally {{to be influenced}} by density-independent processes. To test whether interspecific synchronization through density-dependent processes is caused by predation, we experimentally reduced the densities of the main predators of small mammals in four large agricultural areas, and compared small mammal abundances in these to those in four control areas (2. 5 – 3 km 2) through a 3 year small-mammal population cycle. Predator reduction increased densities of the main prey species, Microtus voles, in all phases of the population cycle, while bank voles, the most important alternative prey of predators, responded positively only in the low and the increase phase. Manipulation also increased the autumn densities of water voles (Arvicola terrestris) in the increase phase of the cycle. No treatment effects were detected for <b>common</b> <b>shrews</b> or mice. Our results are in accordance with the alternative prey hypothesis, by which predators successively reduce the densities of both main and alternative prey species after the peak phase of small-mammal population cycles, thus inducing a synchronous low phase...|$|R

Of 647 blood samples collected from shrews, 121 (18. 7 %) showed evidence of infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum and 196 (30. 3 %) with Babesia microti. By comparison, of 1505 blood samples from field voles, 96 (6. 4 %) were positive for A. phagocytophilum and 458 (30. 4 %) for Ba. microti. Both species were infested with the ticks Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes trianguliceps, although they had different burdens: on average, shrews carried almost six times as many I. trianguliceps larvae, more than twice as many I. ricinus larvae, and over twice as many nymphs (both tick species combined). The finding that the nymphs collected from shrews were almost exclusively I. trianguliceps highlights that this species is the key vector of these infections in this small mammal community. These findings suggest that <b>common</b> <b>shrews</b> are a reservoir of tick-borne infections and that the role of shrews in the ecology and epidemiology of tick-borne infections elsewhere needs to be comprehensively investigated.

A total of 347 animals (1, 388 organs) from eight locations in different parts of Norway, collected at different times of the year during 1993 to 1995, were examined. Fifty-two animals (15 %) from five locations, up to 1, 600 km apart, carried orthopoxvirus DNA in one or more of their organs, most frequently in the lungs.

The <b>common</b> tree <b>shrew</b> has well developed cardiac myocyte layers in the tunica media of the cranial vena cava, {{extending from the}} right atrium {{to the root of}} the subclavian vein. Because the <b>common</b> tree <b>shrew</b> belongs to a primitive group of mammals, the occurrence of cardiac musculature in the cranial vena cava may be a common feature in lower mammals. The development of this musculature indicates that active contraction of the cranial vena cava wall occurs in this species. Electron micrographs showed the typical ultrastructure of myocytes and nerve endings. These observations suggest that this musculature may serve as a regulatory pump for the return of venous blood to the right atrium and as a blood reservoir system under conditions of rapid heart rate. Additionally, the presence of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) was also demonstrated in the myocytes of the vena cava immunohistochemically.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies of {{wild animals}} {{responding}} to their native parasites are essential {{if we are}} to understand how the immune system functions in the natural environment. While immune defence may bring increased survival, this may come at a resource cost to other physiological traits, including reproduction. Here, we tested the hypothesis that wild <b>common</b> <b>shrews</b> (Sorex araneus), which produce large numbers of offspring during the one breeding season of their short life span, forgo investment in immunity and immune system maintenance, as increased longevity is unlikely to bring further opportunities for mating. In particular, we predicted that adult shrews, with shorter expected lifespans, would not respond as effectively as young animals to infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined haemolymphatic tissues from wild-caught <b>common</b> <b>shrews</b> using light and transmission electron microscopy, applied in conjunction with immunohistology. We compared composition and function of these tissues in shrews of different ages, and the extent and type of inflammatory reactions observed in response to natural parasitic infections. All ages seemed able to mount systemic, specific immune responses, but adult shrews showed some signs of lymphatic tissue exhaustion: lymphatic follicles in adults (n = 21) were both smaller than those in sub-adults (n = 18; Wald = 11. 1, p< 0. 05) and exhibited greater levels of depletion (Wald = 13. 3, p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Contrary to our expectations, shrews respond effectively to their natural parasites, and show little indication of immunosenescence as adults. The pancreas of Aselli, a unique lymphoid organ, may aid in providing efficient immune responses through the storage of large numbers of plasma cells. This may allow older animals to react effectively to previously encountered parasites, but infection by novel agents, and eventual depletion of plasma cell reserves, could both still be factors in the near-synchronous mortality of adult shrews observed shortly after breeding...|$|R

40|$|First paragraph: Wild {{chimpanzees}} (Pan troglodytes) normally {{select a}} food item {{based on two}} nutritional cues, size and colour [1, 2]. Often wild chimpanzees forage in small groups of individuals, who may encounter a clumped food resource with many food items being available simultaneously (e. g. berries on a small bush [2]). In this situation, travel time between food items may be equal to zero and differences that exist may only relate to the nutritional quality of the food (e) and differences in handling time (h). Thus, prey selection should occur to maximise the e/h ratio [3], since the assumptions of the classic diet model are the same for sequentially and simultaneously encountered prey, but maximisation of e/h {{may not be an}} optimal strategy when food resources are limited and individuals are competing against one another.

40|$|Woodlands {{represent}} refugia {{for wildlife}} within the intensive agricultural landscape of rural Britain {{but over the}} last century these ecosystems have become highly fragmented, exposing woodland specialist species to a range of threats. Management for pheasant shooting affects 14 % of all woodland area in Britain and is often promoted as a way to reconcile sporting interests with conservation. However, the implications of pheasant release and the associated management for ecosystems are not well understood. I examined this issue by quantifying the effects of pheasant release and the associated management on the abundance and diversity of small mammal and breeding bird populations within game-managed woodlands. I found no evidence to suggest that pheasants impacted woodland ecosystems directly. However, the management practices associated with pheasant release did affect native vertebrates. In autumn, wood mice were more abundant near pheasant release pens, perhaps in response to increased resource levels and/or release from predation pressure within the pen. <b>Common</b> <b>shrews</b> decreased near release pens in autumn, potentially as a result of habitat disturbance.
