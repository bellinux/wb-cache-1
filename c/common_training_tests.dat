For region proposal we propose a novel lightweight cascade structure which can effectively improve RPN proposal quality. For object recognition we re-implement global context modeling with a few modications and obtain a performance boost (4. 2 % mAP gain on the ILSVRC 2016 validation set). Besides, we apply the idea of pre-training extensively and show its importance in both steps. Together with <b>common</b> <b>training</b> and <b>testing</b> tricks, we improve Faster R-CNN baseline by a large margin. In particular, we obtain 87. 9 % mAP on the PASCAL VOC 2012 test set, 65. 3 % on the ILSVRC 2016 test set and 36. 8 % on the COCO test-std set. Comment: Preprint to appear in Neurocomputin...|$|R
40|$|In this {{position}} paper, we make several observations {{about the state}} of the art in automatic word sense disambiguation. Motivated by these observations, we offer several specific proposals to the community regarding improved evaluation criteria, <b>common</b> <b>training</b> and <b>testing</b> resources, and the definition of sense inventories. 1 Introduction Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is perhaps the great open problem at the lexical level of natural language processing. If one requires part-of-speech tagging for some task, it is now possible to obtain high performance off the shelf; if one needs morphological analysis, software and lexical data are not too hard to find. In both cases, performance of stateof -the-art systems is respectable, if not perfect, and the fundamentals of the dominant approaches (noisy channel models for tagging, two-level morphology) are by now well understood. For word sense disambiguation, we have a far longer way to go. 2 Observations Observation 1. Evaluation of word s [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRobust speech {{recognition}} in everyday conditions requires {{the solution to}} a number of challenging problems, not least the ability to handle multiple sound sources. The specific case of {{speech recognition}} {{in the presence of a}} competing talker has been studied for several decades, resulting in a number of quite distinct algorithmic solutions whose focus ranges from modeling both target and competing speech to speech separation using auditory grouping principles. The purpose of the monaural speech separation and recognition challenge was to permit a large-scale comparison of techniques for the competing talker problem. The task was to identify keywords in sentences spoken by a target talker when mixed into a single channel with a background talker speaking similar sentences. Ten independent sets of results were contributed, alongside a baseline recognition system. Performance was evaluated using <b>common</b> <b>training</b> and <b>test</b> data and common metrics. Listeners' performance in the same task was also measured. This paper describes the challenge problem, compares the performance of the contributed algorithms, and discusses the factors which distinguish the systems. One highlight of the comparison was the finding that several systems achieved near-human performance in some conditions, and one out-performed listeners overall...|$|R
40|$|Several {{approaches}} have previously {{been taken to}} the problem of discriminating between speech and music signals. These have used different features as the input to the classifier and have <b>tested</b> and <b>trained</b> on different material. In this paper we examine the discrimination achieved by several different features using <b>common</b> <b>training</b> and <b>test</b> sets and the same classifier. The database assembled for these tests includes speech from thirteen languages and music from all over the world. In each case the distributions in the feature space were modelled by a Gaussian mixture model. Experiments were carried out on four types of feature, amplitude, cepstra, pitch and zero-crossings. In each case the derivative of the feature was also used and found to improve performance. The best performance resulted from using the cepstra and delta cepstra which gave an equal error rate (EER) of 1. 2 %. This was closely followed by normalised amplitude and delta amplitude. This however used a much less complex model. The pitch and delta pitch gave an EER of 4 % which was better than the zero-crossing which produced an EER of 6 %. 1...|$|R
40|$|Resnik and Yarowsky (1997) made {{a set of}} {{observations}} {{about the state of}} the art in au-tomatic word sense disambiguation and, motivated by those observations, oered several speci c proposals regarding improved evaluation criteria, <b>common</b> <b>training</b> and <b>testing</b> resources, and the denition of sense inventories. Subsequent discussion of those proposals resulted in senseval, the rst evaluation exercise for word sense disambiguation (Kilgarri and Palmer forthcoming). This article is a revised and extended version of our 1997 work-shop paper, reviewing its observations and proposals and discussing them in light of the senseval exercise. It also includes a new in-depth empirical study of translingually-based sense inventories and distance measures, using statistics collected from native-speaker annotations of 222 polysemous contexts across 12 languages. These data show that mono-lingual sense distinctions at most levels of granularity can be eectively captured by trans-lations into some set of second languages, especially as language family distance increases. In addition, the probability that a given sense pair will tend to lexicalize dierently across languages is shown to correlate with semantic salience and sense granularity; sense hierar-chies automatically generated from such distance matrices yield results remarkably similar to those created by professional monolingual lexicographers. ...|$|R

For this scenario, information from the previous 12  months, i.e. January 2014 to December 2014, is used to either appraise the relationship between rental price and various attributes or to form the database of similar properties. These relationships or database are then used to predict the out-of-sample January 2015 rental prices. Then prediction moves onto February 2015, using February 2014 to January 2015 data, and the final appraisals for December 2015 are based on December 2014 to November 2015 data. This approach allows for {{the adoption of the}} <b>common</b> within-sample <b>training,</b> out-of-sample <b>testing</b> paradigm used in machine learning and allows for models to be updated as new data becomes available, whilst less relevant historic data is removed.|$|R
