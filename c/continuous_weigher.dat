The present work aimed at developing and evaluating a load cell-based weighing system {{for use with}} small to medium size <b>continuous</b> <b>weighing</b> lysimeters.

Making the best use of new weighing scale called a multi-stage conveyor belt scale which can be created so as to adjust the conveyor belt length to the product length, we propose a simplified and effective mass estimation algorithm under practical vibration modes. Conveyor belt scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 140 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minute and more. The output signals from the conveyor belt scales are always contaminated with noises due to vibrations of the conveyor belt and the product in motion.

Numerous studies of natural drying of forest biomass have been carried out based on traditional sampling of piles or weighing.

40|$|Based on the {{principle}} of similarity, the wood drying process can be investigated on a scale model, which is the laboratory drier, instead of the full-size industrial drier. Thus, the investigation is simplified and the drying time reduced. The laboratory drying kiln, developed by the research team, is a controlled climate air duct with closed circuit, fitted with a rectangular test section. The air flow is circulated by a centrifugal fan and the air heating is carried out by a set of electric resistances. The selection of the fan and of the heating resistances was performed according to the aerodynamic and thermal calculations, presented in the paper. For the air humidification, in accordance to the drying schedule requirements, the drier has a steam generator that prepares steam which is injected in the air.

40|$|Cunningham (2000) and Jotisankasa (2005) {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of tensiometerbased suction control systems. In these systems, wetting and drying of the soil are achieved by water injection and circulation of air {{in contact with the}} specimen while suction is monitored by sample-mounted high suction tensiometers. Unlike the axis translation technique, these systems avoid using elevated air pressures and better reproduce the drying and wetting conditions occurring in the field. Building upon these earlier works, this paper describes an automated tensiometer-based suction control system that enables direct measurement of water content changes inside the sample. A diaphragm pump forces air to flow inside a closed loop that runs across the sample while a moisture trap ensures that the relative humidity of the circulating air is kept low. As the circulating air dries the soil, the amount of abstracted water is measured by <b>continuous</b> <b>weighing</b> of the desiccant inside the moisture trap. Wetting of the sample is instead achieved by controlled injection of water through a solenoid valve connected to a pressurized volume gauge. The changes of soil water content are given by the difference between the amounts of water injected by the volume gauge and that retained by the desiccant.

Stable water loss rates (2. 09 xl 0 ~ 8 to 3. 47 xlO~ 8 gh~ 1 cm~ 2 Pa~ 1) were {{as much as an}} order of magnitude less than those reported in earlier studies employing intermittent weighing techniques. We suggest that increased water loss caused by substantial increases in ventilatory water loss during the episodic disturbances required by intermittent weighing is the principal contributor to this discrepancy. Water losses, as well as the interval between spiracular ventilations, decreased with water content. However, greater variation was primarily due to interruptions of the regular cyclic pattern of ventilation by highly variable, activity-related bouts of increased ventilatory loss. Variations in water loss appear to be too large and too rapid to be convincingly explained in terms of cuticular conductance. Our results suggest that previous experiments using 5 % CO 2 anaesthesia, linking changes in total water loss to the conducting properties of the cuticle, were not valid. There seems to be no adaptive value for the proposed voluntary increases in cuticular permeability in an animal where ventilatory water losses can be so high...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWater balance {{simulation}} in {{cropping systems}} {{is a very}} useful tool to study how water can be used efficiently. However this requires that models simulate an accurate water balance. Comparing model results with field observations will provide information {{on the performance of}} the models. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the performance of DSSAT model in simulating the water balance by comparing the simulations with observed measurements. The soil water balance in DSSAT uses a one dimensional “tipping bucket” soil water balance approach where available soil water is determined by the drained upper limit (DUL), lower limit (LL) and saturated water content (SAT). A <b>continuous</b> <b>weighing</b> lysimeter was used to get the observed values of drainage and evapotranspiration (ET). An automated agrometeorological weather station close to the lisymeter was also used to record the climatic data.

For that reason simulated cumulative values had larger errors as the time passed by. These results suggested the need to compare outputs of DSSAT and some hydrological model that simulates soil water movement with a more mechanistic approach. The comparison of the two models will allow us to find which mechanism can be modified or incorporated in DSSAT model to improve the simulations...|$|R

The selected species represent contrasting canopy types typical of vegetation of semiarid areas. Free throughfall coef®cients were estimated from ®eld measurements of low volume rainfall events and vertical photographs taken beneath the plant canopy.

The interception model was then run to simulate interception loss during actual rainfall events, using atmospheric conditions measured every 5 s. The results from this simulation showed signi®cant differences in interception loss between species, which can be explained by differences in canopy drainage and boundary layer conductance, and are caused primarily by the structural differences in their canopies.

Meteorological data based drying models are the state-of-the-art {{to monitor the}} drying progress. The <b>continuous</b> <b>weighing</b> approach is used to gain data for developing these models. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the drying performance of oak (Quercus L.) logs stored in piles for energy purposes and assess the effect of model time interval base on the accuracy of meteorological data based drying models. The log pile’s moisture content dropped from initial 38. 9 % on February 1, 2013 to 24. 8 % on October 21, 2013, resulting in a total reduction of 14. 1 %. At the end, moisture content was distributed evenly within the logs and total dry matter losses were low (2. 4 %). From load and meteorological data, models were developed including 10 -minute, hourly, daily and monthly time interval bases. Model performance was validated by comparing the model estimates to the basic observation. Models proved to be very accurate in estimating moisture content change.

40|$|Previous {{studies in}} the Pacific Northwest have {{suggested}} a link between forest logging and increased streamflows. We present {{a brief overview of}} previous experimental efforts designed to identify mechanisms for these increases, especially during rain-on-snow (ROS) and spring snowmelt events. To extend the applicability of these data, we describe our measurement of snow accumulation, melt, and micrometeorology in existing uncut forest and shelterwood units as part of the Demonstration of Ecosystem Management Options (DEMO) study. Uncut forest units are dominated by over 100 -year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) with stand basal areas of ca. 40 m 2 /ha. Micrometeorology is measured 2 m above the ground surface in each 13 -ha unit. Snow accumulation and melt are measured via weekly snow courses. Snowpack outflow is obtained from two 2. 6 m 2 non-weighing snow lysimeters in each unit. Large (25 m 2) weighing lysimeters provide a continuous record of snowpack evolution at scales unaffected by variability in canopy throughfall. Snow interception is measured by <b>continuous</b> <b>weighing</b> of cut trees. Harvest treatments will be imposed during summer 1998 and additional post-harvest data will be collected. Pre-harvest data indicate up to 60 % greater (33 mm) 3 -day production of runoff and 150 % greater (22 mm) 3 -day snowmelt (outflow minus throughfall) in the shelterwood than in the uncut forest unit during ROS events. Snowmelt during radiation-dominated spring events is ca. 50 % greater (15 mm) in the shelterwood. Results from the weighing lysimeters show high correlation with snow course data from the shelterwood but poor correlation with those from the uncut forest due to small scale spatial variability in tree canopy coverStorck et al "Measurement of differences in snow accumulation, melt, and micrometeorology due to forest harvesting.

40|$|Abstract Background Milk {{ejection}} {{is essential}} for a successful lactation, however techniques to measure milk ejection in women are often complex and invasive. Recent {{research has demonstrated that}} at milk ejection, milk duct diameter increased in the breast (measured by ultrasound) {{at the same time as}} milk flow rate increased (measured using a weigh balance). This study aimed to evaluate a purpose-built <b>continuous</b> <b>weigh</b> balance (Showmilk, Medela AG) to measure changes in milk flow rate from the breast to identify milk ejections during milk expression. In addition, the Showmilk was used to determine if milk ejection occurred simultaneously in both breasts during double pumping. Methods Increased milk flow rates during single pumping were compared to simultaneous ultrasound measurements of increased milk duct diameters in 14 mothers. In addition, increases in milk flow rate were compared between the left and right breasts of 28 mothers during double pumping for 15 minutes with two separate electric breast pumps attached to two Showmilks to record milk flow rate. Results Increased milk flow rates were associated with increased milk duct diameters during single pumping. The mean number of milk ejections was not different between the Showmilk (4. 2 ± 2. 0) and ultrasound (4. 5 ± 1. 5) techniques. Overall, 67 milk ejections were measured and of these, 48 (72 %) were identified by both techniques. The left and right breasts responded synchronously with 95. 5 % of the flow rate increases corresponding between the breasts. The mean number of milk ejections identified by an increase in milk flow rate during double pumping was 5. 1 ± 1. 7 and 5. 0 ± 1. 7 for the left and right breasts, respectively. In addition, mothers chose the same expression vacuum for the left (- 198 ± 31 mmHg) and right (193 ± 33 mmHg) breasts. Conclusion The Showmilk can simply and non-invasively record milk ejections by measuring increases in milk flow rate that correspond with increases in milk duct diameter. For the first time measurement of milk flow rate has been used to confirm that milk ejections occur simultaneously in the left and right breasts during double pumping. The use of the Showmilk will facilitate further research into the relationship of milk ejection and milk removal. </p...|$|R

A Boltzmann solution for piece-wise linear transport data is used. For the special case of linear data in two-intervals, explicit formulas to get the sorption coefficient are given.
