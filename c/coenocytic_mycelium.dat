40|$|Entomophthoromycota {{is one of}} {{six major}} phylogenetic {{lineages}} among the former phylum Zygomycota. These early terrestrial fungi share evolutionarily ancestral characters such as <b>coenocytic</b> <b>mycelium</b> and gametangiogamy as a sexual process resulting in zygospore formation. Previous molecular studies have shown the monophyly of Entomophthoromycota, thus justifying raising the taxonomic status of these fungi to a phylum. Multi-gene phylogenies have identified five major lineages of Entomophthoromycota. In this review we provide a detailed discussion about the biology and taxonomy of these lineages: I) Basidiobolus (Basidiobolomycetes: Basidiobolaceae; primarily saprobic); II) Conidiobolus (Entomophthoromycetes, Ancylistaceae; several clades of saprobes and invertebrate pathogens), as well as three rapidly evolving entomopathogenic lineages in the family Entomophthoraceae centering around; III) Batkoa; IV) Entomophthora and allied genera; and V) the subfamily Erynioideae which includes Zoophthora and allied genera. Molecular phylogenic analysis has recently determined the relationships of several taxa that were previously unresolved based on morphology alone: Eryniopsis, Macrobiotophthora, Massospora, Strongwellsea and two as yet undescribed genera of Basidiobolaceae...|$|E
40|$|Heterokaryons of Neurospora crassa were {{generated}} by transformation of multinucleate conidia of a histidine- 3 auxotroph with $his- 3 ^+$ plasmid. In {{one of the}} transformants, propagated on a medium with histidine supplementation, a gradual but drastic reduction occurred {{in the proportion of}} prototrophic nuclei that contained an ectopically integrated $his- 3 ^+$ allele. This response was specific to histidine. The reduction in prototrophic nuclei was confirmed by several criteria: inoculum size test, hyphal tip analysis, genomic Southern analysis, and by visual change in colour of the transformant incorporating genetic colour markers. Construction and analyses of three-component heterokaryons revealed that the change in nuclear ratio resulted from interaction of auxotrophic nucleus with prototrophic nucleus that contained an ectopically integrated $his- 3 ^+$ gene, but not with prototrophic nucleus that contained $his- 3 ^+$ gene at the normal chromosomal location. The growth rate of heterokaryons and the activity of histidinol dehydrogenase—the protein encoded by the $his- 3 ^+$ gene—remained unchanged despite prototrophic nuclei becoming very scarce. The results suggest that not all nuclei in the <b>coenocytic</b> fungal <b>mycelium</b> may be active simultaneously, the rare active nuclei being sufficient to confer the wild-type phenotype...|$|R

Bacteriol. 84 : 841 – 858. 1962. —Mucor rouxii {{was grown}} under three different atmospheres of incubation: air, N 2, and CO 2 in parallel cultures. The atmosphere of incubation markedly affected nutritional requirements, growth, and morphogenesis. Absence of oxygen greatly reduced growth {{and increased the}} nutritional demands of the fungus. Presence of a high tension of CO 2 resulted in a change from filamentous to yeastlike morphogenesis. Aerobically, a large variety of carbon sources was utilized; anaerobically, only hexoses served to meet requirements for carbon and energy. Aerobically, various amino acids supported abundant growth; anaerobically, they were poorly utilized. Ammonium and nitrate ions were better sources of nitrogen for anaerobic growth. In general, incubation under either air or N 2 resulted in development of <b>coenocytic</b> filamentous <b>mycelium,</b> whereas incubation under CO 2 resulted in development of budding yeastlike cells. Variations in temperature and time of incubation, inoculum size, type and concentration of carbon source, type of nitrogen source, and presence of various substances with known action on fungal morphogenesis altered growth in many cases, but did not significantly affect the patterns of vegetative morphogenesis conditioned by each atmosphere of incubation. However, vegetative morphogenesis was strongly affected by addition of certain chelating agents. Yeastlike development of M. rouxii was prevented by ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in concentrations which were also partially inhibitory for growth; under these conditions, development was filamentous. Chemically related chelating agents were similarly active. The growth-inhibitory and morphogenetic effects of EDTA were reversed by transition-group metal ions. Yeastlike development of M. subtilissimus, which does not require CO 2 for its induction, was also inhibited by EDTA...|$|R
40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) fungi {{living in}} symbiotic {{association with the}} roots of vascular plants have {{also been shown to}} host endocellular rod-shaped bacteria. Based on their ribosomal sequences, these endobacteria have recently been identified as a new taxon, Candidatus Glomeribacter gigasporarum. In order to investigate the cytoplasmic stability of the endobacteria in their fungal host and their transmission during AM fungal reproduction (asexual), a system based on transformed carrot roots and single-spore inocula of Gigaspora margarita was used. Under these in vitro sterile conditions, with no risk of horizontal contamination, the propagation of endobacteria could be monitored, and it was shown, by using primers designed for both 16 S and 23 S ribosomal DNAs, to occur through several vegetative spore generations (SG 0 to SG 4). A method of confocal microscopy for quantifying the density of endobacteria in spore cytoplasm was designed and applied; endobacteria were consistently found in all of the spore generations, although their number rapidly decreased from SG 0 to SG 4. The study demonstrates that a vertical transmission of endobacteria takes place through the fungal vegetative generations (sporulation) of an AM fungus, indicating that active bacterial proliferation occurs in the <b>coenocytic</b> <b>mycelium</b> of the fungus, and suggests that these bacteria are obligate endocellular components of their AM fungal host...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to {{plant and animal}} cells, the fungal cells are multinucleate. A consequence of their multinucleate condition is heterokaryosis — the occurrence of genetically different nuclei in a common cytoplasm. In nature this condition occurs because of spontaneous mutations in the haploid nuclei in the <b>coenocytic</b> <b>mycelium.</b> Inspite of heterokaryosis being a fundamental aspect of fungal biology, the behaviour and dynamics of nuclei in fungal mycelium are little understood. This study was prompted by the following questions: (1) Why does a fungus need so many nuclei? (2) Are they all active simultaneously? (3) Does {{the proportion of the}} different nuclear types in fungal mycelium alter in response to change in conditions of growth? (4) Is the activity of an enzyme related to the dose of nuclei containing the encoding gene? Experimental approach. The approach taken was to generate heterokaryons in which one of the nuclear types carries a mutant allele for a specific enzyme while the other nuclear type carries the functional allele, introduced by transformation. Because in filamentous fungi, the transforming DNA commonly integrates randomly into the chromosomal DNA, the transformants would be genetic 'variants' in which the ratios of transformed to non-transformed nuclei might be controlled differently. The transformants could thus be useful in investigating the relationship between the frequency of transformed nuclei and the activity of encoded enzyme. In addition the transformants might be useful for studying nuclear behaviour. The availability of developmental information, genetic and molecular methodology, and biochemical mutant in Neurospora crassa made this fungus a material of choice for this investigation. Strain construction. A histidinol dehydrogenase (his- 3) mutant strain was used into which an albino colour marker and a biochemical marker, inositoL were introduced by crossing. The latter two markers served as check against possible laboratory contamination. In addition, a gene mem, was introduced into the strain. In the mem genetic background, the strain has a wild-type morphology on agar medium but when grown in liquid shake culture it produces uninucleate microconidia that are useful in estimating nuclear ratio. Protoplasts of a constructed strain (his- 3 al- 1; mem; inl) were transformed with a plasmid containing the wild-type his- 3 allele, thereby converting the original strain into a heterokaryotic strain having a mixture of transformed (his- 3 +t) and untransformed (his- 3) nuclei. [The superscript +/ is used here to denote an his~ 3 + allele ectopically introduced by transformation]. Integration of plasmid DNA sequence in three selected transformants, 2 T 5, 3 T 3 and 4 T 12, was confirmed by genomic Southern analysis using the vector DNA as probe. The exponential growth rate of all three transformants was similar (~ 0. 08 mgh" 1). Nuclear ratio. Assuming a uniform distribution of nuclei in mycelium, and a correspondence between nuclear ratio in mycelium and conidia, the ratio his- 3 * {: his- 3 was estimated by plating microconidia. In transformant 3 T 3, the nuclear ratio was 7 : 1. In 2 T 5, all nuclei were his- 3 n. Transformant 4 T 12 did not produce microconidia. The nuclear ratio in this transformant was therefore estimated by macroconidial plating and found to be 1 : 5, in favour of his- 3 nuclei. Behaviour of transformants in vegetative and sexual phase. Although the transformants had originally been selected for the expression of his- 3 +T gene, a majority of macroconidia produced in cultures of 3 T 3 and 2 T 5 required histidine to trigger their germination. This condition, referred to as cphenotypic lag', led to a gross underestimation of the proportion of prototrophic macroconidia by the direct plating method and biased the estimation of nuclear ratios. Therefore nuclear ratio was estimated by first germinating macroconidia on histidine supplemented medium before testing colonies in histidine dropout slants and comparing the numbers of auxotrophic and prototrophic mycelia. Phenotypic lag was not observed in 4 T 12. The variation in the degree of expression of phenotypic lag among the transformants was ascribed to transgene position effect. The transformants differed also in meiotic instability of the transforming DNA — the transforming DNA in 3 T 3 was passed through unchanged but it was deleted or modified in 4 T 12 and 2 T 5. Experimental alteration of nuclear ratio. The transformants differed with respect to the self-adjusted ratio of transformed to non-transformed nuclei and also to the degree to which their nuclear ratio could be altered by nutritional manipulation of the growth medium, i. e., by growing the transformants in {{the presence or absence of}} histidine in the medium. In 3 T 3, the proportion of his- 3 +t nuclei progressively decreased by 3. 5 -fold in the sixth subculture on histidine medium. The change in 4 T 12 was even more striking: in the sixth serial subculture, the proportion of his- 3 +t nuclei decreased from 17 - 20 % to - 0. 05 %. However, when it was propagated again in medium that lacked histidine, the frequency of his- 3 +t nuclei was immediately restored to original level (- 17 %). That drastic alterations in nuclear ratio occurred upon nutritional manipulation was verified by Southern analysis. The intensity of signal specific for transformed DNA (nuclei) in cultures grown without histidine supplement was strong, but barely detectable in cultures grown with histidine. The signal reappeared when 4 T 12 was propagated in medium lacking histidine. Histidine induced change in nuclear ratio in 4 T 12 was further confirmed by three tests: (i) inoculum test using conidia, (ii) hyphal tip analysis, and (iii) genetic test using colour markers. Nuclear ratio and enzyme activity. Because in 4 T 12 changes in nuclear ratio could be manipulated, this transformant was used to investigate whether the proportion of his- 3 +t nuclei is correlated with the levels of encoded enzyme, histidinol dehydrogenase. Surprisingly, the specific activity of histidinol dehydrogenase was the same regardless of the percentage of his- 3 +t nuclei. This observation suggested that the physiological demand of a metabolite may be satisfied with only a few nuclei carrying the relevant gene. Or in other words the majority of nuclei in the <b>coenocytic</b> <b>mycelium</b> may, perhaps, not be active simultaneously. Silencing of transforming DNA in nuclei. Two experiments were done to test the possibility that in a majority of nuclei, the transforming DNA is selectively silenced by methylation of cytosine: (1) Southern analysis of chromosomal DNA digested with isoschizomers, and (2) Reactivation by growth of transformants in presence of 5 -azacytidine, an inhibitor of methylation. The results suggested that a majority of transformed nuclei may, perhaps, be inactive. The results of Northern analysis suggested that the amount of his- 3 +t transcript was correlated (but 5 -azacytidine experiment indicated that only few his- 3 +t nuclei may be active) with the proportion of his- 3 +t nuclei, but not histidinol dehydrogenase activity. The above results suggested that expression of his- 3 +t gene was controlled both at the levels of transcription and posttranscription. Nuclear selection. To study competition between nuclei containing mutant (his- 3) nuclei and prototrophic nuclei containing his- 3 + gene at its normal chromosomal location or at the ectopic location, heterokaryons were synthesized using strains in which the nuclear types had been marked by non-allelic genetic colour markers, al- 1 and al- 2. The results suggested that in heteronuclear mixture, the replication rate of the transformed nuclei is affected as compared to the nuclei having the gene in normal chromosomal location. Major contributions. This study generated (his- 3 + his- 3 +) heterokaryons by transformation. The behaviour of transformants differed in some respects both in the vegetative and sexual phases. It was demonstrated that nuclear ratio could be experimentally altered. However, there was no correlation between nuclear ratio and enzyme activity. The observations imply asynchronous division rate among nuclei and raise the possibility that not all nuclei in the <b>coenocytic</b> <b>mycelium</b> are active simultaneously...|$|E

The {{published}} {{news item}} is copyrighted by American Phytopathological Society {{and can be}} found at: [URL] aurantiaca {{is a member of the}} Senecionaea tribe of the Asteraceae, indigenous to Java. Commonly known as purple velvet plant, this tropical species is well adapted to landscapes in South Florida, but is mostly seen as a potted plant for use in the interiorscape. During February 2013, a local nursery submitted Gynura aurantiaca samples to the Florida Extension Plant Diagnostic Clinic in Homestead, FL, where 30 % of 1, 000 plants were affected. Downy, white mycelium was observed on the abaxial leaf surface, and the adaxial surface of affected leaves appeared darker in color. Severely affected leaves began to curl as the tissue turned necrotic. The pathogen was identified as Plasmopara halstedii (Farl.) Berl. & De Toni based on the presence of <b>coenocytic</b> <b>mycelium,</b> and right-angled, monopodially branched sporangiophores with sporangia that were hyaline, obvoid to elliptical, and measuring 21 × 29 × 17 to 21 μm (Delanoe 1972). Molecular identification was conducted by extracting pathogen DNA using the QIAGEN Plant DNA kit (QIAGEN, Gaithersburg, MD). PCR of the 5 ′ terminal domain of the nuclear DNA coding for the large subunit (LSU rDNA) was performed with primers NL 1 and LR 3 (Kurtzman et al. 1998; Vilgalys and Hester 1990). The PCR product was purified with the QIAquick kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced bidirectionally. The sequence from our isolate (GenBank Accession No. KR 028988) was nearly identical (exhibited 97 % nucleotide identity; 98 % query coverage; E value = 0. 0) to an isolate of P. halstedii (EF 553469). A phylogenetic analysis was performed using the obtained sequence data and fifteen Plasmopara sequences from GenBank and a Fusarium solani accession as an outgroup (Maximum Likelihood, Tamura-Nei model). Our isolate grouped with P. halstedii with high bootstrap support (98 % bootstrap value, 1, 000 replicates) further supporting identification as P. halstedii. Pathogenicity of the sequenced isolate was evaluated in shade-house experiments. Two-month-old Gynura aurantiaca plants were inoculated with a sporangial suspension (1 × 10 ⁶ sporangia/ml) of P. halstedii that was collected by washing sporangia from the abaxial surface of purple passion leaves using autoclaved distilled water. Inoculum or autoclaved water was sprayed over the foliage until runoff. Six plants were sprayed per treatment and the experiment was repeated twice. Inoculated plants were placed in a shade house (73 % shade) when temperatures ranged from 17 to 28 °C with 78 to 98 % relative humidity. Plants were observed for disease development, and pathogen sporulation occurred within seven days of inoculation. No symptoms developed on the control plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Plasmopara halstedii causing downy mildew on Gynura aurantiaca. Gynura aurantiaca is highly valued for its stunning purple foliage and low input production costs, but a disease such as downy mildew has the potential to substantially reduce if not eliminate commercial production...|$|E
