While other people were present, the work was shared and Anno, Akai and Yamaga worked full-time on the production, the direction was not professional, but Takeada attributed Okada as the producer, with Yamaga directing, Akai doing character animation and Anno as the mecha animator. Takeada also said other individuals were involved and were used to trace cels or paint cels as needed, but still credits Yamaga, Akai and Anno with the production itself. Filming was done by a camera on a tripod and frames were <b>called</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> Anno because the production lacked timing sheets.|$|E

Veronica gets Piz to accept her leaving for the internship. At the Sheriff’s station, Weevil is <b>called</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> several students as being the one who gave them the fake cards. Weevil is put in the jail cell, but he tells Veronica that he think they targeted him after he was showcased in the criminology class. She investigates several of {{the owners of the}} student IDs, who do seem genuine in accusing Weevil. Weevil gets bail, but Keith informs him that a student ID printing machine was found in the locker next to Weevil’s. Veronica and Wallace speak to a mechanical engineering professor, who says that it would be impossible for Weevil to be the culprit. Piz invites Keith to appear on his show in an election special before Keith informs Veronica that Weevil’s fingerprints were found all over the investigation.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{controversy}} of his game, Ledonne became an unwitting spokesman for the games industry, facing the medium's opponents in debates and forums. The furor resulting from Slamgate was <b>called</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> Ledonne and others in the media as a sign that video games had not yet outgrown the traditional stereotype of children's games.

[...] Authors Andreas Jahn-Sudmann and Ralf Stockmann consider controversial video games such as Super Columbine Massacre and the Grand Theft Auto [...] "Hot coffee mod" [...] evidence of sociopolitical tensions present between gamers and older generations.

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the first season, one of the show's animators confirmed that [...] "Derpy" [...] would be a scripted background character in the second season, and was a part of several sight gags. In the original broadcast of the mid-season episode [...] "The Last Roundup" [...] {{as well as on the}} home media The Friendship Express release, [...] "Derpy" [...] was <b>called</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> name by Rainbow Dash, and given lines (as voiced by St. Germain) and klutzy mannerisms as a direct call-out to the brony fandom. Though most of the fans appreciated the inclusion, some viewers had a negative response to the character, believing her portrayal insulted the mentally handicapped. Hasbro subsequently modified these scenes, and while [...] "Derpy" [...] is still present in subsequent broadcast and digital versions of the episode, she is not named, and a different voice is used. According to Hasbro's Nicole Agnello, [...] "Some viewers felt that aspects of the episode 'The Last Roundup' did not stay true to the core message of friendship which is the heart and soul of the series. Hasbro Studios decided to make slight audio alterations to this single episode." [...] Despite Hasbro's intentions, some members of the brony community were disappointed, and some made efforts to restore the original voice. [...] "Derpy" [...] remained in background cameos throughout other episodes in season 2 and 3. Within season 4, Derpy was re-introduced, remaining silent and unnamed but with her original wall-eyed look, as a side character in the main story of [...] "Rainbow Falls". The appearance was planned as a big reveal for the brony fans, according to co-director Jim Miller, and that [...] "she is here to stay" [...] according to Hasbro's vice president for entertainment Mike Vogel. The Derpy character is used often on Hasbro's marketing of the show. For example, Hasbro's exclusive pony toy at the Comic-Con International and My Little Pony Fair in 2012 was based on [...] "Derpy", and has the same cross-eye look.|$|E
