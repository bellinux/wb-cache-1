40|$|Accelerometer cables {{should be}} {{securely}} fastened to stationary components with clamp, tape, or other adhesive means to minimize relative cable motion (cable whip). Cable motion can introduce self noise, especially in high-impedance signal paths (for example, from piezoelectric accelerometer output to charge amplifier input). This self-generated noise {{is referred to}} as the triboelectric effect. Although the low-noise treatment of cable is a solution to minimizing this effect it is still necessary to limit the motion of cables to further reduce noise. When an accelerometer cable is fastened to non-moving structure it introduces cable strain near the electrical connector of the accelerometer that pushes or pulls the accelerometer while it is in movement. Such a push or pull contributes to the accelerometer rocking motion that is a main source of measurement uncertainty. In practice, leaving enough slack to allow free movement of the accelerometer while securing the cable may reduce the cable strain in trade with cable motion limitation. This paper presents the development of a laser position sensing system to study this trade-off. Dummy accelerometers are fabricated that integrate mirrors and electrical connector. The dummy accelerometers have the same mechanical dimensions of commercial accelerometers and are made of solid steel to eliminate the rocking motion due to accelerometer housing. A laser beam is incident on one of the mirrors of the dummy accelerometer. The reflected laser beam is received by a lateral effect position sensitive detector (PSD) to monitor any motion that deviates from the axial motion due to the rocking motion. A twochannel waveform recorder is used to capture the PSD output signals. The waveform recorder, which is equipped with a computer interface, is capable of analog-to-digital conversion, storage of the PSD output signals and display of laser beam deviations in real time. With this system the adjustment of <b>cable</b> <b>fastening</b> can be done in real time. An example is given in this paper that shows the accelerometer rocking motion for different <b>cable</b> <b>fastening</b> conditions. The system can also be used to study the rocking motion of a vibration shaker while performing calibration for different mass loads and air bearing flow rates.

The field detected at a height of 600 m reaches 65 kV/m while that at the surface does not exceed 5 kV/m. The field intensity in altitude is a better criterion for determining the right moment to launch a rocket devoted to flash triggering. Using Gauss's law, the simultaneous field variations at several levels are used in order to evaluate charge densities. Average values close to 1 nC. m(- 3) are calculated in layers up to 600 m.

50|$|A {{suspension}} bridge works by hanging a roadway from cables or chains under tension. Though a few unstiffened {{suspension bridge}}s exist, a longitudinal stiffening truss or girder is usually added to prevent excessive {{movement of the}} deck. The cables pass over towers and are anchored at both ends. Conventional suspension bridges use massive concrete or rock anchorages to resist the cable’s tension. In self-anchored suspension bridges, however, the <b>cables</b> are <b>fastened</b> to {{both ends of the}} longitudinal girders. These girders are therefore compression struts in addition to stiffening the roadway.Because each of Pittsburgh's Three Sisters appears to be a self-contained unit not dependent on the river banks for anchorage, a debate ensued among engineers whether these structures were cantilevers rather than suspension bridges. While current wisdom holds them to be the latter, the erection procedure shows how each bridge was built in halves toward the center. Temporary diagonal struts between chain and deck provided shear resistance turning each incomplete half into a trussed cantilever arm. These struts 'freed themselves' when the halves were jacked together and connected to form a suspension bridge.|$|R

40|$|Mooring <b>cable</b> system, <b>fastening</b> the {{floating}} platform is an indispensable segment {{in the development}} and utilization of ocean energy. However, the nonlinear cable geometry and non- linear hydrodynamic forces perplex the construction of numer- ical modelling of mooring cable. Traditionally, the cable mod- elling is constructed just considering the geometry of cable, the normal, and the tangential directions. Not only the geometry of cable, but also the relative velocity of fluid is involved in constructing of the numerical modelling of cable in this paper. The expression of external loads by this numerical modelling is effective and accurate taking advantage of explicit separation of external loads in transverse and lengthwise directions. This modelling also simplified the formulation of hydrodynamic drag forces which is dominant among external loads. The stiffness and damping of cable, apparent weight, hydrodynamic drag forces, effect of added mass, and Froude-Krylov force are considered during building of this numerical modelling. The mooring ca- ble fastening a floating sphere stands on buoyancy forces due to the submerged sphere. The simulation results of this numerical modelling were compared and verified with the results from Pro- teusDS which is an offshore simulation code. Copyright © 2013 by ASME...|$|R

However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and <b>cables</b> were <b>fastened,</b> {{that it was impossible}} to cast them off.

In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over.|$|R

60|$|Thus Aeolus {{drove them}} away, and they sailed {{for seven days}} and nights, till they saw land, {{and came to a}} harbour with a narrow entrance, and with tall steep rocks on either side. The other eleven ships sailed into the haven, but Ulysses did not venture in; he {{fastened}} his ship to a rock at the outer end of the harbour. The place must have been very far north, for, as it was summer, the sun had hardly set till dawn began again, as it does in Norway and Iceland, where there are many such narrow harbours within walls of rock. These places are called fiords. Ulysses sent three men to spy out the country, and at a well outside the town they met a damsel drawing water; she was the child of the king of the people, the Laestrygonians. The damsel led them to her father's house; he was a giant and seized one of the men of Ulysses, meaning to kill and eat him. The two other men fled to the ships, but the Laestrygonians ran along the tops of the cliffs and threw down great rocks, sinking the vessels and killing the sailors. When Ulysses saw this he drew his sword and cut the <b>cable</b> that <b>fastened</b> his ship to the rock outside the harbour, and his crew rowed for dear life and so escaped, weeping for the death of their friends.

When this operation is performed in a dock, for example, one end of the line is carried forward some little distance towards the direction in which they wish the vessel to go, and is made fast there to a pile, or ring, or post, or some other suitable fixture on the quay, or on board another vessel. The other end of the line, which has remained all the time on board the ship, is now attached to the capstan or the windlass, and the line is drawn in. By this means the vessel is pulled ahead.|$|R

60|$|It was {{not long}} before I communicated to his Majesty the plan I formed for seizing the enemy's whole fleet. The Empire of Blefuscu is an island parted from Lilliput only by a channel eight hundred yards wide. I {{consulted}} the most experienced seamen on the depth of the channel, and they told me that in the middle, at high water, it was seventy glumguffs (about six feet of European measure). I walked toward the coast, where, lying down behind a hillock, I took out my spy-glass, and viewed the enemy's fleet at anchor--about fifty men-of-war, and other vessels. I then came back to my house and gave orders for a great quantity of the strongest cables and bars of iron. The cable was about as thick as packthread, and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle. I trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same reason twisted three of the iron bars together, bending the ends into a hook. Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the coast, and taking off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked into the sea in my leather jacket about half an hour before high water. I waded with what haste I could, swimming in the middle about thirty yards, till I felt ground, and thus arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour. The enemy was so frightened when they saw me that they leaped out of their ships and swam ashore, where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand. Then, fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each ship, I tied all the cords together at the end. Meanwhile the enemy discharged several thousand arrows, many of which stuck in my hands and face. My greatest fear was for my eyes, which I should have lost if I had not suddenly thought of the pair of spectacles which had escaped the Emperor's searchers. These I took out and fastened upon my nose, and thus armed went on with my work in spite of the arrows, many of which struck against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any other effect than slightly disturbing them. Then, taking the knot in my hand, I began to pull; but not a ship would stir, for they were too fast held by their anchors. Thus the boldest part of my enterprise remained. Letting go the cord, I resolutely cut with my knife the <b>cables</b> that <b>fastened</b> the anchors, receiving more than two hundred shots in my face and hands. Then I took up again the knotted end of the cables to which my hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy's largest men-of-war after me.|$|R

Thus faith and hope getting hold of both ends of the promise, they carry it safely all away. 5. Faith looketh to Christ, as dead, buried, and ascended; and hope to his second coming (1 Cor 15:1-4). Faith looks to him for justification, hope for glory (Rom 4:1-8). 6. Faith fights for doctrine, hope for a reward (Acts 26:6,7). Faith for what is in the bible, hope for what is in heaven (Col 1:3-5). 7. Faith purifies the heart from bad principles (1 John 5:4,5). Hope from bad manners (2 Peter 3:11,14; Eph 5:8; 1 John 3:3). 8. Faith sets hope on work, hope sets patience on work (Acts 28:20, 9:9). Faith says to hope, look for what is promised; hope says to faith, So I do, and will wait for it too. 9. Faith looks through the word to God in Christ; hope looks through faith beyond the world to glory (Gal 5:5).|$|R
6000|$|... 4. Late Roman Period. That is to say, {{the time}} of the {{beginning}} of the Renaissance landscape by the Caracci, Claude, and Salvator. First, in their landscapes, shipping begins to assume something like independent character, and to be introduced for the sake of its picturesque interest; although what interest could be taken by any healthy human creature in such vessels as were then painted has always remained a mystery to me. The ships of Claude, having hulls of a shape something between a cocoa-nut and a high-heeled shoe, balanced on their keels {{on the top of the}} water, with some scaffolding and cross-sticks above, and a flag at the top of every stick, form perhaps the purest exhibition of human inanity and fatuity which the arts have yet produced. The harbors also, in which these model navies ride, are worthy of all observation for the intensity of the false taste which, endeavoring to unite in them the characters of pleasure-ground and port, destroys the veracity of both. There are many inlets of the Italian seas where sweet gardens and regular terraces descend to the water's edge; but these are not the spots where merchant vessels anchor, or where bales are disembarked. On the other hand, there are many busy quays and noisy arsenals upon the shores of Italy; but Queen's palaces are not built upon the quays, nor are the docks in any wise adorned with conservatories or ruins. It was reserved for the genius of Claude to combine the luxurious with the lucrative, and rise to a commercial ideal, in which <b>cables</b> are <b>fastened</b> to temple pillars, and lighthouses adorned with rows of beaupots. It seems strange also that any power which Salvator showed in the treatment of other subjects utterly deserts him when he approaches the sea. Though always coarse, false, and vulgar, he has at least energy, and some degree of invention, as long as he remains on land; his terrestrial atrocities are animated, and his rock-born fancies formidable. But the sea air seems to dim his sight and paralyze his hand. His love of darkness and destruction, far from seeking sympathy in the rage of ocean, disappears as he approaches the beach; after having tortured the innocence of trees into demoniac convulsions, and shattered the loveliness of purple hills into colorless dislocation, he approaches the real wrath and restlessness of ocean without either admiration or dismay, and appears to feel nothing at its shore except a meager interest in bathers, fishermen, and gentlemen in court dress bargaining for state cabins. Of all the pictures by men who bear the reputation of great masters which I have ever seen in my life (except only some by Domenichino), the two large [...] "Marines" [...] in the Pitti Palace, attributed to Salvator, are, on the whole, the most vapid and vile examples of human want of understanding. In the folly of Claude there is still a gleam of grace and innocence; there is refreshment in his childishness, and tenderness in his inability. But the folly of Salvator is disgusting in its very nothingness: it is like the vacuity of a plague-room in an hospital, shut up in uncleansed silence, emptied of pain and motion, but not of infection.|$|R

I trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same reason I twisted three of the iron bars together, bending the extremities into a hook. Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the north-east coast, and putting off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked into the sea, in my leathern jerkin, about half an hour before high water. I waded with what haste I could, and swam in the middle about thirty yards, till I felt ground. I arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour. The enemy was so frightened when they saw me, that they leaped out of their ships, and swam to shore, where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand souls. I then took my tackling, and, fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each, I tied all the cords together at the end. While I was thus employed, the enemy discharged several thousand arrows, many of which stuck in my hands and face, and, beside the excessive smart, gave me much disturbance in my work. My greatest apprehension was for mine eyes, which I should have infallibly lost, if I had not suddenly thought of an expedient. I kept, among other little necessaries, a pair of spectacles in a private pocket, which, as I observed before, had escaped the emperor’s searchers. These I took out and fastened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and thus armed, went on boldly with my work, in spite of the enemy’s arrows, many of which struck against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any other effect, further than a little to discompose them. I had now fastened all the hooks, and, taking the knot in my hand, began to pull; but not a ship would stir, for they were all too fast held by their anchors, so that the boldest part of my enterprise remained. I therefore let go the cord, and leaving the looks fixed to the ships, I resolutely cut with my knife the <b>cables</b> that <b>fastened</b> the anchors, receiving about two hundred shots in my face and hands; then I took up the knotted end of the cables, to which my hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy’s largest men of war after me.|$|R
