40|$|A {{wheel in}} a graph G(V, E) is an induced {{subgraph}} consisting of an odd hole {{and an additional}} node connected to all nodes of the hole. In this paper, we study {{the wheels of the}} column intersection graph of the OLS polytope (PI). These structures induce valid inequalities for this polytope, which are facet defining for its set packing relaxation. Our work builds on simple structural properties of wheels which are used to categorise them into a number of <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive</b> <b>classes.</b> Each such class gives rise to a set of valid inequalities for PI. Moreover, this classification allows us to estimate the cardinality of the whole wheel class as well as to derive a recognition algorithm for the circulant matrices corresponding to wheels of a particular type. In a forthcoming paper, we show for some of the wheel classes presented here that they give rise to facet-defining inequalities for PI...|$|E

5000|$|Compare this to {{the concept}} of a set of {{mutually}} exclusive events. In such a set no more than one event can occur at a given time. (In some forms of mutual exclusion only one event can ever occur.) The set of all possible die rolls is both <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive</b> and mutually exclusive. The outcomes 1 and 6 are mutually exclusive but not <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive.</b> The outcomes [...] "even" [...] (2,4 or 6) and [...] "not-6" [...] (1,2,3,4, or 5) are <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive</b> but not mutually exclusive. In some forms of mutual exclusion only one event can ever occur, whether <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive</b> or not. For example, tossing a particular biscuit for a group of several dogs cannot be repeated, no matter which dog snaps it up.|$|R

50|$|One {{example of}} an event that is both <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive</b> and {{mutually}} exclusive is tossing a coin. The outcome must be either heads or tails, or p (heads or tails) = 1, so the outcomes are <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive.</b> When heads occurs, tails can't occur, or p (heads and tails) = 0, so the outcomes are also mutually exclusive.|$|R

50|$|In the coin-tossing example, both {{outcomes}} are, in theory, jointly exhaustive, {{which means}} {{that at least one}} of the outcomes must happen, so these two possibilities together exhaust all the possibilities. However, not all mutually exclusive events are <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive.</b> For example, the outcomes 1 and 4 of a single roll of a six-sided die are mutually exclusive (both cannot happen at the same time) but not <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive</b> (there are other possible outcomes; 2,3,5,6).|$|R

50|$|Events are <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive</b> {{if all the}} {{possibilities}} for outcomes are exhausted by those possible events, so {{at least one of}} those outcomes must occur. The probability {{that at least one of}} the events will occur is equal to one. For example, there are theoretically only two possibilities for flipping a coin. Flipping a head and flipping a tail are <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive</b> events, and there is a probability of one of flipping either a head or a tail. Events can be both mutually exclusive and <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive.</b> In the case of flipping a coin, flipping a head and flipping a tail are also mutually exclusive events. Both outcomes cannot occur for a single trial (i.e., when a coin is flipped only once). The probability of flipping a head and the probability of flipping a tail can be added to yield a probability of 1: 1/2 + 1/2 =1.|$|R

40|$|Events {{that are}} {{mutually}} exclusive, <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive,</b> {{and have a}} constant sum must be negatively correlated. This study examined whether non-motor vehicle accidental deaths and homicides in young US children displayed {{a period of time}} when this rule governing mutually exclusive events was applicable. Homicide and non-motor vehicle accident mortality rates in boys and girls, aged 1 to 4 years old, in the United States from 1940 to 2005 were analyzed. Homicide mortality rates increased sharply in young boys when the accident mortality rate dropped to about 25 / 100, 000; and in young girls, when the accident mortality dropped to about 18 / 100, 000. This increase in child homicide mortality rates corresponded to a time period when the sum of homicide rates and non-motor vehicle accident rates in these children were relatively constant, making these rates of unnatural deaths mutually exclusive, <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive,</b> and having a nearly constant sum. Homicide rates in young US children were relatively stable both before and after this critical constant sum time period. These findings suggest that the increase in homicide rates in young US children appear to have reflected the necessary negative correlation between mutually exclusive, <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive,</b> and constant sum events, rather than an actual increase in societal violence directed against young children...|$|R

Moreover, applying conventional life cycle assessment, and assigning environmental impacts to producers and consumers can lead to double-counting.

Gallego and Lenzen demonstrate and discuss a method of consistently delineating producers' supply chains, into mutually exclusive and <b>collectively</b> <b>exhaustive</b> responsibilities to be shared by all agents in an economy. Their method is an approach to allocating responsibility across agents in a fully inter-connected circular system.
