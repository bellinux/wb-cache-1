5|$|Pinter {{was born}} and raised in Hackney, east London, and educated at Hackney Downs School. He was a {{sprinter}} and a keen cricket player, acting in school plays and writing poetry. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art but did not complete the course. He was fined for refusing National service as a conscientious objector. Subsequently, he <b>continued</b> <b>training</b> at the Central School of Speech and Drama and worked in repertory theatre in Ireland and England. In 1956 he married actress Vivien Merchant and had a son, Daniel, born in 1958. He left Merchant in 1975 and married author Lady Antonia Fraser in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{had flown}} {{a total of}} 8 sorties throughout the war and dropped 27 tons of bombs. With the conclusion of hostilities the squadron <b>continued</b> <b>training</b> and on November 10 even moved once more to Tel Nof. The B-17s flew a few more sorties during a January 1957 survey of the Sinai but were soon sent back to storage. 69 Squadron was finally disbanded on March 1, 1957. It was initially slated to operate the IAF's next heavy bomber, the Sud-Ouest Vautour, but these plans were dropped in favour of 110 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Ueshiba {{moved to}} Tokyo in 1926, where {{he set up}} the Aikikai Hombu Dojo. By now he was {{comparatively}} famous in martial arts circles, and taught at this dojo and others around Japan, including in several military academies. In the aftermath of World War II the Hombu dojo was temporarily closed, but Ueshiba had by this point left Tokyo and retired to Iwama, and he <b>continued</b> <b>training</b> at the dojo he had set up there.

40|$|<b>Continuing</b> {{vocational}} <b>training</b> {{is considered}} {{to play an important}} role in both social and occupational inclusion. The present paper will analyse the influence this exerts on participation in <b>continuing</b> vocational <b>training</b> and on private expenditure, the latter being measured in terms of the costs borne by the trainees themselves and the amount of free time invested. Consideration needs to be accorded to the fact that individual social groups enjoy different levels of access to <b>continuing</b> <b>training</b> and to the circumstance that their commitment to <b>continuing</b> <b>training</b> is influenced by varying prevailing general conditions. For this reason, the principle focus of the paper will be on the question of how these general conditions or work-life situations can be described and on whether it is possible to identify various groups. The main features of vocational orientation measures will also be included in the analysis. The basis for the study is the data collected by an expert commission set up to look into the financing of lifelong learning and the participation or non-participation in <b>continuing</b> <b>training</b> and the results of an investigation conducted by the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training into the costs and benefits of <b>continuing</b> vocational <b>training</b> for individuals. These two studies are based on the same statistical population and render it possible to observe aspects of both <b>continuing</b> <b>training</b> participation and private expenditure in terms of how these relate to <b>continuing</b> <b>training.</b> It becomes readily apparent that persons may be allocated to groups in accordance with the work-life situation characteristics they display, these groups exhibiting differences in terms of inclusion and investment in <b>continuing</b> vocational <b>training.</b> Although gender is revealed to exert no significant individual influence on commitment to <b>continuing</b> <b>training,</b> women in particular form a group which has its basis in their work-life situation, the fact that the latter tends to present some difficulties meaning that a lower level of commitment to <b>continuing</b> <b>training</b> may be exhibited. In addition to the above, vocational orientation measures exert a clear influence on commitment to <b>continuing</b> <b>training.</b> " (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en)) Additional Information Kurzfassung (deutsch) Executive summary (English) Weiterbildungsbereitschaft, Weiterbildungsverhalten, Bildungsmotivation, Weiterbildungsbeteiligung, Bildungsinvestitionen, Arbeitnehmer, Lebenssituation, Frauen, Arbeitsorientierung, Weiterbildung, Teilnehmerstruktur, Bildungsökonomie...|$|R

5|$|After graduation, Brundage {{began work}} as a {{construction}} superintendent for the leading architectural firm of Holabird & Roche. In the three years {{he worked for the}} firm, he supervised the construction of $7.5million in buildings—3percent of the total built in Chicago in that time-frame. He disliked the corruption of the Chicago building trades. Brundage's biographer, Allen Guttmann, points out that the young engineer {{was in a position to}} benefit from influence if he had wanted to, as his uncle, Edward J. Brundage, was by then Republican leader of Chicago's North Side and would become Attorney General of Illinois. Brundage had been successful in a number of track and field events while at Illinois. In 1910, as a member of the Chicago Athletic Association (CAA), he finished third in the national all-around championships (an American predecessor of the decathlon), sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and <b>continued</b> <b>training,</b> aiming at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the night strike Task Group 111.2 departed for Manus Island. On 16 June a Japanese aircraft was detected by radar. One of the Seafires was detached from the combat air patrol to intercept it, but the fighter's pilot had to abandon the attempt due to a mechanical problem. The Task Group arrived at Manus Island on 17 June, and <b>continued</b> <b>training</b> exercises there until the remainder of the BPF arrived on 4 July en route to further operations off Japan. All of the warships at Manus sailed on 6 July to join the Fast Carrier Task Force in attacks on the Japanese home islands. Implacable and the other ships of the BPF operated against Japan from 17 July to 12 August, during which time the Fleet conducted air attacks and participated in several bombardments of coastal Japanese cities. On 12 August most of the BPF's ships, including Implacable, departed for a period of maintenance and rest at Sydney.|$|E
5|$|In May 1950, Bolt was {{reassigned to}} VMF-224 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, and he {{remained}} there until May 1951. The squadron flew the F2H Banshee and {{within three months}} of joining the unit he had flown more hours on the aircraft than any other pilot in the squadron. This {{was followed by a}} quick four-month tour on the staff at the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. During this time, the US Air Force was operating its first squadron of F-86 Sabre aircraft. The Sabres were the only U.S. aircraft which performed well against the MiG-15s operated by China and North Korea in the Korean War. Bolt used his connections to enter an exchange program with the USAF in September 1951, becoming an exchange officer with the 318th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at McChord Air Force Base in Washington flying the F-94 Starfire. Soon after, he began piloting the F-86F Sabre which had been transferred to the squadron. He <b>continued</b> <b>training</b> with the squadron and was promoted to major in December 1951.|$|E

5|$|The ship {{remained}} largely inactive in Philadelphia {{for the next}} three years. On 22 January 1917, she became a receiving ship for naval recruits. Alabama was transferred to the southern Chesapeake to begin training recruits in the middle of March. Shortly thereafter, on 6 April, the United States declared war on Germany. Two days later, Alabama became the flagship of the 1st Division, Atlantic Fleet, {{and for the rest of}} the war she continued her training mission of the east coast of the United States. During this period, she made one cruise to the Gulf of Mexico from late June to early July 1918. On 11 November, Germany signed the Armistice that ended the fighting in Europe; Alabama <b>continued</b> <b>training</b> naval recruits, though at a reduced level of intensity. She took part in fleet maneuvers in February and March 1919 in the West Indies before returning to Philadelphia in April for repairs. A summer training cruise for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy followed; Alabama departed Philadelphia on 28 May bound for Annapolis, where she arrived the next day. After taking on a contingent of 184 midshipmen, she steamed out of Annapolis on 9 June. The cruise went to the West Indies and passed through the Panama Canal and back. By mid-July, the ship was cruising off the coast of New England. She returned south in August for maneuvers, and at the end of the month she returned the midshipmen to Annapolis before docking in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Because of Saratogas age and {{the number}} of modern {{carriers}} in service, the Navy decided to modify her into a training carrier. The aft elevator and its machinery were removed, the opening was plated over and the forward elevator was replaced with a larger model. Part of the hangar deck was converted into classrooms. While the ship was still under repair Captain Frank Akers assumed command on 27 April. The post-refit machinery trials on 12 May revealed some problems with one turbine, and an explosion in one 5-inch gun wounded eleven men and wrecked the mount. The full-power trials were completed on 20 May and a new mount was loaded aboard to be installed at Pearl. The ship sailed for NAS Alameda a few days later where she picked up 60 aircraft, 1,200 passengers and some trucks for delivery in Pearl. Saratoga arrived on 1 June and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Ralph F. Jennings, commander of Carrier Division 11. She resumed carrier qualification training on 3 June until she returned to the dockyard on 10 June for the installation of her replacement five-inch gun mount. Jennings transferred his flag to another carrier from 11 to 30 June. She <b>continued</b> <b>training</b> carrier pilots after the Japanese surrender until 6 September. Over the span of the ship's 17-year career, Saratogas aviators landed on her deck 98,549 times, then the record for the most carrier landings. Saratoga received eight battle stars for her World War II service. After the war, the ship took part in Operation Magic Carpet, the repatriation of American servicemen from the European, Pacific, and Asian theaters. She left Hawaii on 9 September with 3,712 Navy officers and enlisted men bound for the United States. In the course of the operation, she returned 29,204 veterans, the highest total for any individual vessel.|$|E
5|$|Training teams {{arrived from}} the 2/3rd Battalion, which had already fought the Japanese in New Guinea, and a program of jungle warfare {{training}} began, progressing from individual fieldcraft to large-scale exercises. In June, amphibious training was carried with the Australians working with the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment around Trinity Beach. The following month, a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Joshua, arrived. In early August, the battalion moved by road to Cairns. On 8 August 1943, the 2/43rd embarked upon HMAS Manoora, bound for Milne Bay in New Guinea. There, the battalion undertook further training in preparation for its debut in the Pacific. In mid-August, it moved by landing craft to Buna. It <b>continued</b> <b>training</b> there until 5 September, when the 24th Brigade embarked in landing craft for beaches near Lae, arriving {{the day after the}} main landing as part of follow-on forces behind the 20th and 26th Brigades. For 11 days, the battalion advanced west as part of a two-pronged advance on Lae, the 7th Division advancing overland from Nadzab while the 9th Division moved along the coast. Initially, there was only limited opposition from the Japanese as the battalion advanced through the villages of Buso and Apo, and the Singaua Plantation. The Burep River was crossed, but the Australian advance west was slowed by numerous water obstacles and eventually torrential rain which flooded the Busu River. At this point, Japanese resistance stiffened and after the 24th Brigade forced its way across the Busu, the 2/43rd advanced slowly along the coast, reaching Wagan to the south of Malahang airfield. On 16 September, the 7th Division entered Lae, with the 2/43rd situated around the Butibum River. The advance on Lae cost the battalion 18 killed and 25 wounded.|$|E
