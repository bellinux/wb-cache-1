Trust {{is an essential}} line of <b>corporate</b> <b>communications,</b> <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> and reputation management of companies and it is personalized by the CEOs and top management. According to the data, the trust of CEOs saw the biggest decline in the U. S. while in Slovakia the trust is still quite high; on the contrary, in the E. U. in general, the level of trust of CEOs reached a historical minimum of 30 %. The overall shift from trusting the traditional authorities, such as government, CEOs and offi cial representatives to academics, stakeholders, employees and general “vox populi ” can be seen globally.

Nevertheless both disciplines have different theoretical frameworks, which make marketing and <b>corporate</b> <b>communications</b> distinct. A third problem is that while Marketing and Marketing Communications have an established relationship, <b>corporate</b> <b>communications</b> and <b>Public</b> <b>Relations</b> are frequently confused.

The paper argues {{that there is a}} special demand for reputation management in today’s <b>corporate</b> <b>communications</b> and <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> due to fragmented publics and stakeholders, as well as to increased public interest in corporations. The introduction of real-time media has also imposed new demands which corporations today must meet to survive. Different stakeholders possess the ability to benefit but also to harm the corporations through corporate reputation. Cultivated stakeholder relations can be especially beneficial to corporate reputation and long-term development, and the social ties that stakeholders embody can even be seen as social capital for the corporation. A new concept of “Faith-holders ” is also presented to better describe corporate social capital...|$|R

40|$|Normally, {{feasibility}} studies would be commissioned for industrial projects {{to assess the}} worth of undertaking them, {{in terms of their}} content, timing, costs, and internal and external stakeholder and environmental influences. The study concentrates on the <b>corporate</b> <b>communications</b> and <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> working environment, and uses the various elements of a feasibility study as a basis for investigating {{the extent to which the}} same or similar principles are used, or are applicable, or both, to corporate reputation management. The fieldwork phase of the study was conducted using an iterative, interpretive approach, consisting of two rounds of unstructured interviews. This type of research method was selected for its flexibility which matches the exploratory, developmental and unpredictable nature of the research. Several parallels were drawn between feasibility study elements and corporate reputation management, in particular the importance of maintaining stakeholder contact; looking at other organisations' experiences; paying attention to corporate objectives, culture and values; business operations; costs and benefits; timescales and resource; environment and risk identification and the strategy for resolving them. During the course of undertaking this research I discovered that one of the potential drawbacks identified with using {{feasibility studies}} was some lack of understanding of the formal and informal mix of processes among interview respondents within a <b>corporate</b> <b>communications</b> or <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> environment. This could also suggest that this type of environment is unsuitable for a rigid process due to its responsiveness and fluidity. I would argue, however, that feasibility studies are very adaptable and flexible and as a consequence, they can be regularly brainstormed and reviewed throughout a project's lifecycle. This can also apply to corporate reputation management concerns, since failure to regularly review these issues can result in manager being unprepared if a crisis hits. I believe that my research clearly shows that feasibility study principles, to a greater or lesser extent, can be applied to event management as an indicator of the robustness or otherwise of a firm's corporate reputation management. It also demonstrates that, despite their apparent incompatibility, the two disciplines of <b>corporate</b> <b>communications</b> and project management can comfortably co-exist, both academically and corporately.

40|$|Purpose – The paper {{suggest that}} <b>corporate</b> <b>communications</b> is {{becoming}} less predictable as interaction with stakeholders is moving from organizational control toward ‘issue arenas’, places of interaction where an issue is discussed by stakeholders and organizations both online {{and within the}} traditional media. The role of <b>corporate</b> <b>communications</b> and <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> is broadening beyond the traditional relationship management to issue arena monitoring. Design/methodology/approach – Theoretical approach with six axioms suggested. Findings – Several central theories of <b>corporate</b> <b>communications</b> are combined with issues management and stakeholder theory to argue for a multiplicity of new ‘issue arenas’, which require an increased amount of monitoring. Six axioms are suggested for future research on <b>corporate</b> <b>communications,</b> and a mosaic of multiple strategies for multiple publics moved by multiple issues is recommended. Research limitations/implications – The axioms suggested require empirical testing with different arenas across contexts and cultures, and the axioms may change over time as the virtual arenas expand. Future studies {{should focus on the}} process of arena formation as well as the division of voice on the arenas. Practical implications – Monitoring becomes central as corporate communication is less controllable. Corporate communication and <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> will {{play a key role in}} organizational survival in the future through the processes of finding the right issues and ‘issue arenas’ for interaction, facilitating the organization-public debate and through this managing organizational reputation. A change in thinking is required, as identifying issues should precede identifying stakeholders. Originality/value – This paper argues that organizational survival depends not only on communicating with the right stakeholders, but also on finding the relevant issue arenas in which organizations should participate in discussion.

40|$|Crisis Communication {{frameworks}} {{are essentially}} restricted to <b>Corporate</b> <b>Communications</b> and <b>Public</b> <b>Relations</b> theory and are mainly developed {{for use in}} corporate settings. They therefore do not readily transfer to the public sector where " [...] . the notion of crisis as process, the transnational dimensions of contemporary crises, the politicization of crises, [and] the increasing importance of the media [...] . " exacerbates the complexity and longevity of these crises. (Rosenthal, 2003 : 129). To address this, I have chosen to conduct this study in the public sector, where the increased complexity and mutability of protracted crises and the ensuing impact on stakeholder relations provides an opportunity to extend debates' in Crisis Communication and Stakeholder Relationship Management. To do this, I embark on {{an analysis of the}} Goldenberg and Anglo- Leasing corruption Cases of Kenya and explore the impact of the resultant crises on the relationship between the Government of Kenya (GoK), and the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWI), as a keys stakeholder group. In what is a new approach' to a study of this kind, I combine Computer-aided Corpus Linguistic Analysis (CLA) and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). Starting off with the CLA, I analyse select' media texts, GoK reports and BWI reports, so as to: identify linguistic patterns within these texts; interpret what these patterns represent; and demonstrate how these representations lead to the emergence and mobilisation of concepts within the data. Secondly, I lift the study to the level of discursive practice, where my objectives are to: analyse the linguistic patterns over time; identify emerging and competing Discourses; explore what these Discourses represent as part of the GoK's sensemaking/giving efforts; and establish the impact on the relationship between the BWI and the GoK over time. Ultimately, based on the findings of this study, I suggest an arena model as an alternative to conduit models of communication where the crisis takes centre stage and the organisation, the public, the media and other stakeholders become active participants ih the crisis resolution process. I also make methodological contributions to Discourse Analysis by demonstrating that CLA can provide a more objective and standardised way of labelling discourses. ...|$|R
