40|$|BACKGROUND: Citrus pre-harvest fruit drop, {{caused by}} huanglongbing infection, has {{increased}} dramatically concomitant with declining tree health and crop harvest size. This loss of harvestable fruit is damaging to both growers and juice processors. Recovering and converting this fruit to alternative value added products would benefit the citrus industry. Therefore, we have explored the potential of using this fruit as a feedstock in our newly developed pilot scale <b>continuous</b> <b>steam</b> explosion process. RESULTS:Whole fruitswere converted to steam-exploded biomass using a continuous pilot scale process. The sugar composition of raw fruit and steam-exploded biomass was determined. Recovered pectic hydrocolloids and phenolic compounds were characterized. Pectic hydrocolloids comprised 78 g kg− 1 of the dry material in the dropped fruit. Following the steam explosion process {{almost all of the}} pectic hydrocolloids were recoverable with a water wash. They could be functionalized in situ or separated fromthe milieu. Additionally, approximately 40 %of the polymethoxylated flavones, 10 %of the flavanone glycosides, 85 % of the limonoids and almost 100 % of hydroxycinnamates were simultaneously recovered. CONCLUSION: The <b>continuous</b> <b>steam</b> explosion of pre-harvest dropped citrus fruit provides an enhanced, environmentally friendlymethod for the release and recovery of valuable coproducts from wasted biomass...|$|R

40|$|In {{reservoirs}} {{with extra}} heavy oil and bitumen, thermal methods {{are used to}} reduce the viscosity, in order to extract the oil. Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is a thermal method where <b>continuous</b> <b>steam</b> injection is used. In this method, two horizontal wells are placed in parallel. The upper well injects steam and the lower well produces oil and condensed water. The <b>continuous</b> <b>steam</b> injection creates a chamber with uniform temperature. Heavy oil and bitumen reserves in Western Canada, which exceed 175 billion barrels, are becoming increasingly important petroleum sources due to the technical success of the SAGD processes. This study includes Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling and simulations of a horizontal oil well with SAGD. The simulations are performed with inflow control devices (ICD) and autonomous inflow control valves (AICV) completion. In the SAGD processes, {{it is important that}} the residence time for steam in the reservoir is high enough to ensure that all the injected steam condenses in the reservoir to reduce the amount of steam injection and thereby making the SAGD process more energy effective. The simulations are carried out with ICD completion to delay the steam breakthrough and with AICV completion to prevent breakthrough of steam and water to the well. The numerical results showed that a most of the steam was produced together with the oil when ICD completion was used. AICV was able to close for steam and water, and the steam was thereby forced to condense in the reservoir, resulting in better utilization of the condensation energy...|$|R

30|$|During steam flooding, {{there is}} a {{transition}} zone between the steam (hot zone) and the oil (cold zone) where the steam condenses to hot water.

Ahead of the transition zone is the steam with high temperature while the cold oil with connate water is present behind it. The transition zone is advancing with <b>continuous</b> <b>steam</b> injection to drive the oil forward and our focus is to control it by application of the additive. According to fractional flow theory, either oil or water flows on its own path and does not influence each other. In water-wet rocks, water flows near the rock surface while oil flows {{through the center of the}} porous media. The additive is transported to transition zone and precipitates due to the sudden temperature drop. If the additive is hydrophilic it will occupy the water flow paths to reduce the water permeability without impact on the oil permeability, resulting in reduction in water/oil mobility ratio.|$|R

40|$|Heavy oil and bitumen {{represent}} a massive world resource {{more than twice}} the size of global reserves of light or conventional oil. In reservoirs with extra heavy oil and bitumen, thermal methods are used to reduce the oil viscosity, in order to extract the oil. Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is a thermal method where <b>continuous</b> <b>steam</b> injection is used. In this method, two horizontal wells are placed in parallel. Different types of inflow control technologies are developed to increase oil recovery by avoiding production of unwanted fluids, and the newest on the market is an autonomous inflow control valve (AICV). In the SAGD processes, {{it is important that the}} residence time for steam is high enough to ensure that the injected steam condenses in order to utilize all the latent heat. The AICV technology has the ability avoid steam to be produced together with the oil. The valves will locally shut off the zones with steam breakthrough, and simultaneously produce oil from the other zones along the well. The technology eliminates the steam breakthrough problems and contributes to optimize the SAGD process. Reservoir simulations with Rocx in combination with OLGA are performed to study the potential of increased oil recovery using SAGD in combination with AICV completion. TechPlot is used to study the reservoir conditions. The results are discussed regarding oil recovery, residual oil saturation and optimization of steam injection...|$|R

30|$|In steam {{flooding}} reservoirs, steam {{has experienced}} heat losses and condensed to water near displacement front where characteristics {{of hot water}} flood is exhibited (Hu 2011). Mobility of condensed water has {{a great impact on}} the sweeping efficiency of steam and oil recovery can be increased by controlling it. From perspective of reducing water permeability, mobility control can be achieved by applying some kind of additive to plug off part of water flow paths. The additive shall be dissolved in hot water and steam while being injected along with them. They will be gradually precipitating from the saturated solution when temperature drops due to heat losses and energy consumption. In porous media, fractional flow of oil and water occurs within their own flow matrix without interfering each other. Water-wet additives preferentially occupy water flow matrix and effectively reduce relative water permeability without affecting the flow of oil. As a result, mobility control of condensed water is achieved and oil recovery is thus enhanced. With heat expansion along with <b>continuous</b> <b>steam</b> (or hot water) injection, precipitated substance is dissolved by the subsequent steam (hot water) and conveyed further to a zone where temperature is low enough for them to precipitate again. This process repeats itself until the additives break through to producer to be recovered to surface. When the injected additives are recovered, water permeability is reinstated. In other words, the reduction of relative water permeability is a temporary and reversible process, which causes no damage to reservoirs.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{shows that}} the architecture of steam generators, steam turbines and heat exchangers for power plants can be predicted {{on the basis of}} the constructal law. According to constructal theory, the flow architecture emerges such that it provides progressively greater access to its currents. Each chapter shows how constructal theory guides the generation of designs in pursuit of higher performance. Chapter two shows the tube diameters, the number of riser tubes, the water circulation rate and the rate of steam production are determined by maximizing the heat transfer rate from hot gases to riser tubes and minimizing the global flow resistance under the fixed volume constraint. Chapter three shows how the optimal spacing between adjacent tubes, the number of tubes for the downcomer and the riser and the location of the flow reversal for the <b>continuous</b> <b>steam</b> generator are determined by the intersection of asymptotes method, and by minimizing the flow resistance under the fixed volume constraints. Chapter four {{shows that the}} mass inventory for steam turbines can be distributed between high pressure and low pressure turbines such that the global performance of the power plant is maximal under the total mass constraint. Chapter five presents the more general configuration of a two-stream heat exchanger with forced convection of the hot side and natural circulation on the cold side. Chapter six demonstrates that segmenting a tube with condensation on the outer surface leads to a smaller thermal resistance, and generates design criteria for the performance of multi-tube designs.

The {{results of this study}} allow the estimation of the volume of oil distilled underground when steam is injected into oil reservoirs at varying pressures and temperatures to recover crude oil.

40|$|The {{eruption}} {{started on}} the northwestern flank of Usu volcano on 31 March 2000, following strong seismicity and inflation of the summit area. The initial vigorous phreatomagmatic eruption moved gradually into phreatic eruption with vertical cock's tail jets in early April. The phreatic eruption was replaced by intermittent small explosion in mid-April, and, furthermore, by <b>continuous</b> <b>steaming</b> that often included ash emissions. Although many craters had been formed by late-April, the eruptive activity became concentrated on a few craters, which enlarged with time. As the eruption proceeded, craters became dry {{and the amount of}} issued steam decreased with time. Uplifting of the crater area had been evident since 3 April, and the rate of uplifting decreased exponentially with time. The amplitude of volcanic tremors changed, reflecting the variation of eruption types; small during vertical jet eruption and large during small explosions. The mode of eruption this time was similar in many ways to that of the 1910 eruption, when cryptodomes were formed in the northern slope over several months of sustained phreatic eruptions. The temporal change of eruption type probably reflected a decrease in water within the vents and rising explosion levels in the vent. This may have resulted from the successive production of slurry (clay and ash) there and, in addition, from the effective cooling of the magma head by groundwater (beneath the crater area).
