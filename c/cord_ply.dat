40|$|Steel, polyester, nylon and rayon are {{the main}} {{materials}} of <b>cords</b> & <b>plies</b> that have been reinforced in the natural rubber to produce quality tyres but there is few research reported on <b>cord</b> and <b>plies</b> reinforcement in silicone rubber. Taking the innovation of tyres as inspiration, this review's first objective is to compile the comprehensive studies about the <b>cords</b> & <b>plies</b> reinforcement in elastomeric polymer matrix. The second objective is to gather information about silicone rubber that has a high potential as a matrix phase for <b>cords</b> and <b>plies</b> reinforcement. All the tests and findings are gathered and compiled in sections namely processing preparation, curing, physical and mechanical properties, and adhesion between cords-polymer...|$|R
5000|$|A {{radial tire}} (more properly, a radial-ply tire) is a {{particular}} design of vehicular tire. In this design, the <b>cord</b> <b>plies</b> are arranged at 90 degrees to the direction of travel, or radially (from {{the center of the}} tire). Radial tire construction climbed to 100% market share in North America, following Consumer Reports finding the superiority of the radial design in 1968.|$|R
5000|$|By comparison, radial tires lay {{all of the}} <b>cord</b> <b>plies</b> at 90 {{degrees to}} the {{direction}} of travel (that is, across the tire from lip to lip). This design avoids having the plies rub against each other as the tire flexes, reducing the tire's rolling friction. This allows vehicles with radial tires to achieve better fuel economy than with bias-ply tires. It also accounts for the slightly [...] "low on air" [...] (bulging) look that radial tire sidewalls have, especially when compared to bias-ply tires.|$|R
50|$|The Pirelli Cinturato may be {{compared}} to a wheel in which the rim {{is attached to the}} hub by means of fine spokes. The tread and belt are in effect the rim; the 90-degree or radial <b>cord</b> <b>plies</b> are the spokes; and the bead is the hub. The inextensible belt and the radial casing cords were the combined factors which gave the Cinturato tyre its special properties.The different geometric arrangement of the Cinturato carcass resulted in greater deformation (bulging) {{in the area of the}} tyre section which is under load, as opposed to previous radial tyres of the period. This caused no disadvantage and did not result in greater tyre casing fatigue. Rather than having the dynamic wave form behind the road contact area, it instead formed on the side wall, increasing stability whilst also allowing the heat generated by cornering and braking to be easily dispersed.|$|R
50|$|Ply-split {{braiding}} is {{a technique}} where one twisted cord (“splitter”) passes through another twisted cord or <b>cords</b> splitting the <b>plies</b> of the latter cords (“splittee” cords). This is unlike weaving or many forms of braiding where cloth is formed by threads interlacing in an over-under sequence. Pattern is formed by cord color, and splitting order.|$|R
5000|$|Radial tire {{construction}} utilizes body <b>ply</b> <b>cords</b> {{extending from the}} beads and across the tread so that the cords are laid at approximately right angles to the centerline of the tread, and parallel to each other, as well as stabilizer belts directly beneath the tread. The belts may be cord or steel. The advantages of this construction include longer tread life, better steering control, fewer blowouts, improved fuel economy, and lower rolling resistance. Disadvantages of the radial tire are a harder ride at low speeds on rough roads and {{in the context of}} off-roading, decreased [...] "self-cleaning" [...] ability and lower grip ability at low speeds.|$|R
50|$|Bias tire (or cross ply) {{construction}} utilizes body <b>ply</b> <b>cords</b> {{that extend}} diagonally from bead to bead, usually at angles {{in the range}} of 30 to 40 degrees, with successive plies laid at opposing angles forming a crisscross pattern to which the tread is applied. The design allows the entire tire body to flex easily, providing the main advantage of this construction, a smooth ride on rough surfaces. This cushioning characteristic also causes the major disadvantages of a bias tire: increased rolling resistance and less control and traction at higher speeds. This outdated technology is still made in limited quantities to supply collector vehicles. It is possible to fit older cars with modern tires if historical authenticity is not paramount.|$|R
50|$|Air pressure, via the <b>ply</b> <b>cords,</b> exerts {{tensile force}} on the entire bead {{surrounding}} the wheel rim on which the tire is mounted, pulling outward in a 360 degree pattern. Thus the bead must have high tensile strength. With no force applied to the outer tread, the bead is pulled equally in all directions, thus no additional net {{force is applied to}} the tire bead and wheel rim. However, when the tread is pushed inward on one side, this releases some tension in the corresponding sidewall ply pulling on the bead. Yet the sidewall ply on the other side continues to pull the bead in the opposite direction. Thus the still fully tensioned sidewall ply pulls the tire bead and wheel rim {{in the same direction as}} the tread displacement with equal force as that applied to push the tread inward.|$|R
40|$|Results from an {{experimental}} study on rayon and nylon tire cords embedded in rubber are reported. Stress-strain curves in tension and compression on thick-walled cylinders of such materials show that much higher moduli of elasticity are exhibited by cords under tension than by cords in compression. However, the compression modulus of twisted cords is not insignificant, and such cords can apparently carry appreciable compressive loads when properly encased in rubber and when prevented from buckling. A bilinear approximation to the stress-strain curves of such materials is proposed {{as a means}} for approximate structural analysis of members utilizing these materials. Based on such a bilinear approximation, an analysis is presented for the state of stress and deformation in a laminated cord-rubber sheet under plane loads, using the principles of orthotropic materials. It is shown that four elastic constants are sufficient to describe the properties of a typical two-ply laminate when all cords are loaded in tension; a differ-ent set or four apply to the same body when it is loaded {{in such a way that}} the <b>cords</b> in both <b>plies</b> are in compression...|$|R
40|$|Symmetry {{has been}} a {{dominant}} feature of ply-split braiding, particularly bilateral symmetry in traditional camel paraphernalia from Rajasthan (image 1) and radial symmetry in modern fiber art vessels (image 2). Exceptions exist, most notably in camel straps with representational figures, but they stand out as such. In recent years, however, artists have begun to experiment with more radically asymmetric forms worked in ply-split braiding. This paper explores reasons for and effects of the shift away from symmetry. In traditional work, much stake was put in technical control of material and tension. In much traditional work and symmetric ply-split fiber art, {{emphasis was placed on}} elaborate surface design, rigorously executed (image 1, 2). Both desiderata were spotlighted by symmetry. The move to asymmetry draws on alternative aesthetic and political ideas. Aesthetically, asymmetry greatly expands the range of forms that can be created. Breaking the constraints of symmetry has permitted exploration of complex surfaces, free-form openwork (image 3), and webs of interconnected stalks (image 4). Politically, asymmetry challenges prevailing criteria of quality by introducing sculpture. However, inspection of asymmetric ply-split objects shows that successful efforts generally require mastery of techniques important for creating high quality symmetric ply-split braiding. These include making of tightly <b>plied</b> <b>cords,</b> controlling tension, anticipating the shaping effect of added and removed cords, and ensuring the compatibility of structural and surface design choices. Thus, criteria for judging success in asymmetric ply-split constructions include but extend beyond those already in place for symmetric work...|$|R
