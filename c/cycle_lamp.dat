40|$|The recent {{adoption}} of a shareholder risk-reward mechanism by the California PUC for the investor owned utilities (IOUs) has left possible shareholder earnings or penalties highly dependent on inputs to the resource net benefit calculations, including savings, costs, and measure life estimates. This is especially true as the California IOU portfolios are heavily reliant on certain compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) measures. This paper focuses on how one critical cost-effectiveness input can affect the overall cost-effectiveness of a CFL program. A few years ago, the California DEER adopted a measure life estimation approach for screw-in CFL measures {{that is based on}} two parameters: manufacturer rated life and hours of operation. The lighting industry rates lamp life using a three hours “on ” and twenty minutes “off ” cycle. Consequently, the DEER rated life-based methodology is different from prior years’ retention data-based measure life estimates typically known as the effective useful life (EUL) 1. The DEER rated life-based estimate provides only a proxy EUL for CFLs, and does not account for other factors that can affect the measure life including “burn time ” (the length of on time per on/off <b>cycle),</b> <b>lamp</b> base orientation, placement in an open or closed fixture, use with timers, dimmers, and motion sensors, early removal, or burnout. This paper critiques the DEER rated life-based methodologies and shows that the length of on time per on/off cycle leads to a different “observed ” life expectancy for CFLs than the manufacturers ’ rated life...|$|E

Although these were mostly used in countries with 100-120volt mains supplies (for lamps of 40W or above), they were briefly popular in other countries because the lamp started without the flicker of switch start systems.

5000|$|Fluorescent lamps work {{by passing}} {{electricity}} through mercury vapor, {{which in turn}} emits ultraviolet light. The ultraviolet light is then absorbed by a phosphor coating inside the lamp, causing it to glow, or fluoresce. Conventional linear fluorescent lamps have life spans around 20,000 and 30,000 hours based on 3 hours per <b>cycle</b> according to <b>lamps</b> NLPIP reviewed in 2006. Induction fluorescent relies on electromagnetism rather than the cathodes used to start conventional linear fluorescent. The newer rare earth triphosphor blend linear fluorescent lamps made by Osram, Philips, Crompton and others have a life expectancy greater than 40,000 hours, if coupled with a warm-start electronic ballast. The life expectancy depends {{on the number of}} on/off cycles, and is lower if the light is cycled often. The ballast-lamp combined system efficacy for then current linear fluorescent systems in 1998 as tested by NLPIP ranged from 80 to 90 lm/W.|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, {{the first}} regular {{production}} mercury vapor (MV) streetlight assembly was developed. It was deemed a major {{improvement over the}} incandescent light bulb, and shone much brighter than incandescent or fluorescent lights. Initially people disliked them because their bluish-green light made people look like they had the blood drained from them. Other disadvantages are that {{a significant portion of}} their light output is ultraviolet, and they [...] "depreciate"; that is, they get steadily dimmer and dimmer with age while using the same amount of energy, and in a few rare instances, they also cycle {{at the end of their}} life cycles. Even rarer is they can burn out, especially when the light is being burned while dim (usually at the end of the life <b>cycle).</b> Mercury <b>lamps</b> developed in the mid-1960s were coated with a special material made of phosphors inside the bulb to help correct the lack of orange/red light from mercury vapor lamps (increasing the color rendering index(CRI)). The UV light excites the phosphor, producing a more [...] "white" [...] light. These are known as [...] "color corrected" [...] lamps. Most go by the deluxe (DX) designation on the lamp and have a white appearance to the bulb. Mercury Vapor Bulbs come in either clear or coated with powers of 50, 75, 100, 175, 250, 400, 700 or 1,000 Watts. The Mercury Vapor lamp is considered obsolete by today's standards and many places are taking them out of service.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by an accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the lysosomal compartment. In this report, we use subcellular fractionation and microscopy to determine the localization of the murine Niemann-Pick C 1 (NPC 1) protein. Fractionation of mouse liver homogenates indicates that some NPC 1 cosediments with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP 1) -containing membranes. However, {{a significant amount of}} NPC 1 is also found in membranes that do not contain LAMP 1. Moreover, fractionation of liver membranes and fibroblasts {{in the presence of a}} nonionic detergent showed that a fraction of NPC 1 cosediments with caveolin- 1 in rafts. Immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured mouse fibroblasts showed that NPC 1 is found in two morphologically distinct structures. The first population {{is characterized by}} large punctate structures that do not colocalize with major organelle protein markers, but do colocalize with filipin and a small fraction of caveolin- 1. Examination of these large NPC 1 -containing compartments using electron microscopy shows that these structures contain extensive internal membranes. The second population is represented by smaller, more diffuse structures, a fraction of which colocalize with LAMP 1 -positive compartments. Incubation of fibroblasts with low density lipoprotein (LDL) increases colocalization of NPC 1 with LAMP 1 -containing compartments. This colocalization can be further enhanced by treating fibroblasts with progesterone or chloroquine. The results indicate that NPC 1 is associated with an unique vesicular compartment enriched with cholesterol and containing caveolin- 1, and that NPC 1 <b>cycles</b> to <b>LAMP</b> 1 -positive compartments, presumably to facilitate the processing o...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} parameters that influence the life of T 5 and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) operating with instant start ballasts. Measurements were carried out during the starting period of the systems as well as during operation. Results reveal that cold ignition has a strong impact {{on the life of}} the systems. Lamp life was found to be less than 5, 000 operating <b>cycles.</b> The same <b>lamps</b> operating with ballasts providing warm start achieved a life of more than 70, 000 starts. Five groups in different operating cycles were tested. Starting time, starting voltage and inrush current were measured during the starting period and their influence on lamp life was examined. The paper also investigates the hypothesis that in every ignition a constant quantity of emissive material is lost and another quantity is also lost during every hour of operation. In general, the results establish that predictions for the lamp life of these systems cannot be drawn, because of the absence of deterministic effects that can be attributed to fluorescent lamps. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R
50|$|HMI bulbs (like all arc bulbs) need {{a current}} {{limiting}} unit to function. Two {{ways of doing}} this are described in the ballast section below. The problem of flickering exists only when using the bulb in combination with magnetic ballast (electronic ballasts produce flicker-free light). HMI bulbs (running with magnetic ballast) present an inherent problem of possibly producing light on film or video with a noticeable flicker. This {{is caused by the}} method by which the unit produces light. An HMI, like an incandescent lighting unit, runs on mains power, which means that the <b>lamp</b> <b>cycles</b> on and off 100 or 120 times per second (twice for every line voltage cycle). Although not visible to the human eye, a film or video camera must be properly synchronized to this cycle or each frame recorded will show different light output. Although incandescent lamps also run off mains power, they don't exhibit perceptible flicker because their filaments don't cool down enough between cycles for their light output to decrease very much. For HMI lamps, flicker can be avoided by the use of electronic ballasts that cycle at frequencies thousands of times faster than the mains frequency.|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet {{germicidal}} irradiation (UVGI) uses UVC radiation {{produced by}} low pressure Hg vapor lamps to control biological air contaminants. Lamp UV output depends on multiple factors, including accumulated operating time (age) and the thermal effects of ambient air temperature and velocity. Additionally, {{the life of}} some lamp types depends on the frequency of on-off <b>cycles.</b> Models of <b>lamp</b> life {{as a function of}} cycling rate and lamp output as a function of age and ambient conditions are developed for three common standard output lamp types based on heat transfer theory and manufacturer’s lamp performance data. Example results are presented and a parametric study {{in the form of a}} 3 k factorial experiment is used to identify significant factors affecting output and their interactions. A typical range of ambient conditions reduces lamp output by more than 30 % of rated capacity and the inclusion of aging effects reduces capacity by as much as 70 %. For given ambient conditions, performance varies substantially across lamp types due to their differing heat transfer characteristics. It is concluded that short term and long term variation of lamp output is highly significant and that modeling of such effects is necessary for accurate system design and analysis...|$|R
5000|$|HPS lamps have {{slightly}} different electrical requirements {{than do the}} older MV lamps. Both HPS and MV lamps require a transformer or ballast to change the voltage and regulate the current, however, HPS lamps also require an electrical [...] "starter" [...] circuit—much like older fluorescent lamps in residential use. MV lamps do not require a separate [...] "starter" [...] circuit {{because they have a}} special starter element within the bulb used for striking the arc. MV lamps slowly dim over time, and a 20-year-old lamp may emit a very pleasing, but useless, soft green glow, rather than the powerful blue-white light of a new MV lamp. The yellow-spectrum HPS lamps also slowly dim over time but are known for [...] "cycling," [...] where the <b>lamp</b> <b>cycles</b> on and off when it has reached the end of its life cycle. When cycling, the arc within the lamp extinguishes and the lamp must cool down before the starter circuit initializes a new arc. This has been the most recognized downfall of HPS. Some HPS lamps start to burn a pinkish/reddish color {{at the end of their}} life (usually when already cycling), or start to burn a pinkish/white color and go dim, or also burn out at the end of their life cycle whether they cycle or not. HPS fixtures can contain a special photocell or ballast that can sense a cycling lamp and shut off the fixture to prevent damage to the ignitor and ballast.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} recent {{progress in}} the development of the Philips's EUV source. Progress has been realized at many frontiers: Integration studies of the source into a scanner have primarily been studied on the Xe source because it has a high degree of maturity. We report on integration with a collector, associated collector lifetime and optical characteristics. Collector lifetime in excess of 1 bln shots could be demonstrated. Next, an active dose control system was developed and tested on the Xe lamp. Resulting dose stability data are less than 0. 2 % for an exposure window of 100 pulses. The second part of the paper reports on {{progress in the}} development of the Philips' Sri source. First, the details of the concept are described. It is based on a Laser triggered vacuum arc, which is an extension with respect to previous designs. The source is furbished with rotating electrodes that are covered with a Sri film that is constantly regenerated. Hence by the very design of the source, it is scalable to very high power levels, and moreover has fundamentally solved the notorious problem of electrode erosion. Power values of 260 W in 2 pi sr are reported, along with a stable, long life operation of the lamp. The paper also addresses the problem of debris generation and mitigation of the Sn-source. The problem is attacked by a combined strategy of protection of the collector by traditional means (e. g. fields, foiltraps, [...] .), and by designing the gas atmosphere according to the principles of the well known halogen <b>cycles</b> in incandescent <b>lamps.</b> These principles have been studied in the Lighting industry for decades and rely on the excessively high vapor pressures of metal halides.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2004. Public {{lighting}} {{is seen as}} a non-core function by many municipalities and therefore does not always receive the necessary management attention. As a result the provision of public lighting maintenance differs substantially between Local Authorities; in some instances public {{lighting is}} in a state of disrepair and in other instances the service delivery is excellent. One of the major problems identified is the lack of information with regard to the number and types of fittings installed and also the number of failures that occur. As a consequence many municipalities cannot provide accurate costs to enable comparison with other Local Authorities. There is also a general lack of consensus as to what constitutes appropriate service delivery in terms of system availability and failure response times. This results in large differences in terms of costs, which range from R 11. 50 to R 26. 60 per fitting per month and system availability, which ranges from less than 70 % to better than 99 %. To establish appropriate service levels responses were obtained from the general public and two groups more directly involved with streetlight maintenance namely, public officials and street lighting experts. This data together with the evaluation of historical data collected over the last 16 months on the Benoni network allows the formulation of appropriate cycle times in order to achieve the expected service delivery in terms of system availability and response times. A holistic literature survey is presented covering the major aspects which impact on service delivery such as the restructuring of the electricity distribution industry and local authority transformation. The aspects of energy efficiency and equipment life expectancy are covered in detail and recommendations are made as to the appropriate replacement <b>cycles.</b> The different <b>lamp</b> replacement policies are also discussed and cost comparisons made. Recommendations made are that a system availability of 98 % is both acceptable and achievable with a moderate budget. Response times of less than 24 hours would be ideal but this does not optimise the utilisation of resources, budget constraints may dictate a longer response time. Response times of more than 5 days would generally be unacceptable. Optimal fitting replacement age is between 19 and 23 years. Under normal circumstances the introduction of energy efficient luminaires is the most cost effective when inefficient fittings have reached their optimal replacement age. Changes in energy costs, tax concessions or cost subsidisation will however impact on the appropriate replacement strategy...|$|R
