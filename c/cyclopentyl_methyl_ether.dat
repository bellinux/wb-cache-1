40|$|Benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens Biovar I. (BAL, EC 4. 1. 2. 38) is a {{versatile}} {{catalyst for the}} organic synthesis of chiral alpha-hydroxy ketones. To allow rapid and convenient activity assessment of BAL, a new, robust, and easy-to-handle activity assay based on direct spectrophotometry was developed. The carboligation of 2 -furaldehyde into alpha-hydroxyketone (R) - 2, 2 ’-furoin {{was used as a}} model reaction. The development of non-conventional media such as supercritical fluids and organic solvents was investigated for BAL catalysed reactions. In view of the low solubility and stability of many substrates and products and the prospect of downstream processing, supercritical fluids were explored as alternative solvents in view of the residual stability, activity, and selectivity of the enzymes in such media. Water activity and enzyme preparation (pH of the lyophilisate) were the main influence parameters. Activity increased with increasing water activity, but stability decreased. Furthermore, non-carbon dioxide supercritical fluids such as fluoroform, ethane, and sulphur hexafluoride gave better results in view of stability, activity, and enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the use of the organic solvent 2 -methyl tetrahydrofuran as a co-solvent increased the activity and stability of BAL. However, as a second phase in an aqueous-organic system, 2 -methyl tetrahydrofuran caused rapid deactivation. Therefore, immobilised BAL (polyvinyl alcohol-entrapped BAL) was used for the two-phase system. The poor solubility of the product in n-hexane caused blockage and deactivation of BAL. n-Hexane gave the highest productivity in both the batch and continuous systems, but only within the first hours of the reaction. Meanwhile, <b>cyclopentyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> gave higher stability and better activity in terms of yield and long-term productivity, relative to the use of n-hexane as the solvent in batch operation.
