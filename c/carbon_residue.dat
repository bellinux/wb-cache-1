40|$|The {{mechanism}} of photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 and H 2 O over copper oxide promoted titania, Cu(I) /TiO 2, was investigated {{by means of}} in situ DRIFT spectroscopy in combination with isotopically labeled 13 CO 2. In addition to small amounts of 13 CO, 12 CO was demonstrated {{to be the primary}} product of the reaction by the 2115 cm− 1 Cu(I) −CO signature, indicating that <b>carbon</b> <b>residues</b> on the catalyst surface are involved in reactions with predominantly photocatalytically activated surface adsorbed water. This was confirmed by prolonged exposure of the catalyst to light and water vapor, which significantly reduced the amount of CO formed in a subsequent experiment in the DRIFT cell. In addition, formation of carboxylates and (bi) carbonates was observed by exposure of the Cu(I) /TiO 2 surface to CO 2 in the dark. These carboxylates and (bi) carbonates decompose upon light irradiation, yielding predominantly CO 2. At the same time a novel carbonate species is produced (having a main absorption at ∼ 1395 cm− 1) by adsorption of photocatalytically produced CO on the Cu(I) /TiO 2 surface, most likely through a reverse Boudouard reaction of photocatalytically activated CO 2 with <b>carbon</b> <b>residues.</b> The finding that <b>carbon</b> <b>residues</b> are involved in photocatalytic water activation and CO 2 reduction might have important implications for the rates of artificial photosynthesis reported in many studies in the literature, in particular those using photoactive materials synthesized with carbon containing precursor...|$|R

The two compounds showed a similar behavior during the oxide reduction, but the Ni ferrite showed a higher activity in ethanol anaerobic oxidation and decomposition, which was also confirmed by TPR experiments. During the first minutes of reaction, when the materials still acted as reactants while being reduced at the same time, the two oxides showed differences in regard {{to the nature of the}} products formed. During reduction, the structural evolution was monitored by means of several physical techniques, thus showing the formation of Fe carbide and metallic species as well. The re-oxidation step, carried out with steam, led to the generation of H- 2 but also to CO. arising from the carbide transformation and the refoming of the <b>carbon</b> <b>residues</b> accumulated during the reduction step.
