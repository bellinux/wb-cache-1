40|$|The family {{physician}} must {{assume the role}} of counsellor on birth control and should therefore be knowledgeable about modern techniques. He should also be aware of sterilization and abortion procedures and should be able to direct his patients to other agencies when necessary. This article covers details of the rhythm method, coitus interruptus, condoms, cervical occlusive devices, <b>chemical</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> intrauterine devices, contraceptive pills, and sterilization of both male and female...|$|E
40|$|An updated {{review of}} {{research}} into contraceptives for men is presented. New {{concepts of the}} pharmacologic effects of chemical agents on germinal stem cells and spermatogenic arrest, {{and the effect of}} new compounds that act at the post-testicular level but do not affect androgen production are discussed. The latest results of studies on steroidal compounds that inhibit pituitary secretion of gonadotropin and hence result in suppression of spermatogenesis and testosterone secretion are presented. The newer contraceptive pills for men are also evaluated. The major drawback to the development of <b>chemical</b> <b>contraceptives</b> for men is the fear of genetic damage and impotence. New and continued research into this type of contraception is urgently needed...|$|E
40|$|Limiting {{sea otter}} {{geographic}} distribution in California (containment management) {{has long been}} recognized as being necessary to preserve human recreational and commercial uses of shellfish resources. However, passage of federal legislation that focused preferentially on marine mammal protection and the 1977 listing of the California sea otter population as "threatened" effectively precluded any range-limiting management program. Research, however, that evaluated various non-lethal means of influencing sea otter movements and distribution was encouraged. Our research suggests that herding and acoustical devices may not have any real potential use in this context. Based on research-related capture success rates, capture and relocation techniques {{may be useful in}} influencing sea otter geographical distribution. The translocation of sea otters to San Nicolas Island provided the first opportunity to test the technical feasibility of maintaining a large area free of sea otters. Capture success rates were appreciably poorer than those achieved during research-related efforts. We identify several logistical and behavioral influences that contributed to the relatively poor success rate. Based on this evaluation, we discuss the factors likely to limit application of these techniques in the future. We feel that capture techniques can be useful in a long-term management program, if used in conjunction with efforts to limit the sea otter population growth rate. Consequently, we feel future research should focus on assessing individual health effects from using <b>chemical</b> <b>contraceptives</b> and assessing the feasibility of their use to safely control population growth.

The trial involved 1,345 women who used contraceptive jelly over a three-year period, from June 1936 to August 1939, and decreased their birth rate by 41 percent.|$|R

The avian control devices that are most effective either physically [...] "block" [...] the birds or [...] "actively modify behavior" [...] using a mild harmless shock.|$|R
50|$|One {{of these}} ships is the Lady MacBeth. Calvert has {{hit on the}} idea of {{transporting}} Lalondes legendarily tough wood (called Mayope) to the pastoral planet of Norfolk, which has banned all high technology. The idea sounds crazy, but it gets around Norfolks ban on high-tech items and gives Calvert access to the planets lucrative market in Norfolk Tears, the most desired alcoholic beverage in the galaxy. Calvert also begins a relationship with Louise Kavanagh, the young and naive daughter of Joshuas business partner, Grant. Although Calvert treats the relationship as a bit of fun, Louise falls in love with Joshua and, due to her planets lack of <b>chemical</b> <b>contraceptive,</b> falls pregnant shortly after he leaves. Unfortunately for Norfolk, Calverts passenger on the flight from Lalonde was a man called Quinn Dexter.|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} been made on the {{bacteriostatic}} and fungicidal properties of oxine (8 -hydroxyquinoline) and other chelating agents, {{and it has been}} suggested that they might act, in part at least, by depriving cells of essential trace metals (Albert, 1951; Martell & Calvin, 1952). In an attempt to determine the trace element requirements of mammalian spermatozoa, White (1955) investigated the effect of several chelating agents on motility. A number were found to be toxic to ram, bull, rabbit and human spermatozoa. In fact some (e. g. sodium diethyl dithiocarbamate, i-nitroso- 2 -naphthol and ethyl potassium xanthate) were much more spermicidal than oxine, which has long been used as a <b>chemical</b> <b>contraceptive</b> in the form of Chinasol. Tests with bull semen showed that cobalt reduced the toxicity of sodium diethyl-dithiocarbamate, nitrosonaphthol and o-phenanthroline. Other mixtures of heavy metals and chelating agents were, however, more toxic than the chelating agents alone. Further studies on the interaction between metals and chelating agents in bull...|$|R
50|$|Higher {{attendance}} {{rates of}} {{high schools and}} university education among women, particularly in developing countries, have helped them make inroads to professional careers with better-paying salaries and wages. Education increases a woman's (and her partner and the family's) level of health and health awareness. Furthering women's levels of education and advanced training also tends to lead to later ages of initiation of sexual activity and first intercourse, later age at first marriage, and later age at first childbirth, {{as well as an}} increased likelihood to remain single, have no children, or have no formal marriage and alternatively, have increasing levels of long-term partnerships. It can lead to higher rates of barrier and <b>chemical</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use (and a lower level of sexually transmitted infections among women and their partners and children), and can increase the level of resources available to women who divorce or are in a situation of domestic violence. It has been shown, in addition, to increase women's communication with their partners and their employers, and to improve rates of civic participation such as voting or the holding of office.|$|R
40|$|Two {{groups of}} sterilized women, 3307 by phenol-atabrine-paste (PAP) {{instillation}} and 1026 by mini-lap technique, were follow-up interviewed {{to determine their}} relative effectiveness. PAP, if successfully performed, was {{as effective as the}} mini-lap. The life table pregnancy rates among successful PAP women were 0. 21 and 0. 28 at I 2 and 24 months, respectively. The rates among the unsuccessful PAP women, however, were high: 15. 1 and 30. 5 at I 2 and 24 months, respectively. In spite of its distinctive advantage of being non-surgical, wider promotion of PAP sterilization procedure deserves caution.

40|$|A {{contraceptive}} may {{be defined}} as a mean of avoiding pregnancy, including all kinds of procedures which are used with this purpose, independently of its mechanism of action. Contraceptives are always used with the idea of avoiding pregnancy and not to produce any therapeutic effect at all. In fact in practice a relative importance is given to the mechanism of action; with attention placed solely upon its efficiency. Ordinarily a contraceptive may gain in favour upon another one simply for utilitarian reasons: for example, to prevent secondary effects, the <b>chemical</b> <b>contraceptive</b> is abandoned and the intrauterine device is adopted.. In general terms contraceptives designate as well all types of means which also act after fecundation has taken place, that is, which interrupt pregnancies. We can include in this context, for example, the so-called «morning-after pill». On the other hand, there axists a general tendency to avoid the term «abortive» with reference to those means which act after fecundation. This is what happens very often in the case of sorne oral contraceptives, which for advertising purposes are called ovulation inhibitors, while in reality very often the effect produce is the interruption of embryonic development, preventing thus the implantation. The transition from using contraceptives to abortion, which is often encountered in many instances, brings into evidence, leads to a much more realistic view against contraceptives than that which is usually made. The important thing is to reach the very core of the problem: a widespread use of contraceptives will not avoid abortions...|$|R
25|$|Contraception is not {{a common}} form of control, but is {{preferred}} by some wildlife managers. It also is expensive to operate - an estimated $6 million annually to drop bait laced with birth-control chemicals. Testing of other potential contraceptives would take about five to eight years and $10 million, with no guarantee of FDA approval. Also, an intensive environmental assessment {{would have to be}} completed to determine whether any nontarget organisms were affected by the <b>contraceptive</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Neither of these control methods is likely {{to be used in the}} near future.|$|R
40|$|Refugee {{youths are}} {{vulnerable}} {{persons who have}} a need for contraception, yet face challenges that limit its use. Data on perceptions, knowledge, access and attitudes toward contraceptive use were collected from 208 refugee youths living in Oru refugee camp, Nigeria. Findings revealed that respondents experience difficulty gaining access to family planning services, which are not available in the camp. Most respondents had little correct information about contraceptives; 42. 9 % had misperceptions about its safety, believing that contraceptives are dangerous and that <b>chemicals</b> in <b>contraceptives</b> can damage their reproductive system. Such beliefs {{have resulted in the}} low use of contraceptives (31. 6 % use last sex) and many unintended pregnancies, which have caused some refugee girls to drop out of school. Findings may aid in the development of targeted interventions to educate refugee youths in order to dispel misperceptions about the safety of contraceptives and ensure adequate access to family planning services (Afr J Reprod Health 2010...|$|R
40|$|Man and {{wildlife}} are continuously exposed to relatively high amounts {{of toxic chemicals}} through nutrition, air, water, and even through the placenta during foetal life. The wide use of industrial and household chemicals {{has led to the}} increased public awareness on toxicity of these compounds. Moreover, several of them, notwithstanding their divergent chemical structure, have already been identified as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) [1]. During recent years several international studies were devoted to this topic, with a particular interest in estrogenic compounds in the environment. Research has shown that chronic exposure to these compounds may cause hormone related cancers, developmental abnormalities and a decreased sperm quality. Estrogenic compounds include natural substances like phytoestrogens and mycoestrogens and man-made <b>chemicals</b> like <b>contraceptives,</b> certain insecticides and herbicides, some PCBs, plasticisers and breakdown products of surfactants [2]. Besides environmental screening methods like immunoassays, an extensive amount of research is performed to develop new and improved methods for confirmation. To this end liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry has been given a lot of attention. Liquid chromatography offers the advantages that a fairly simple sample preparation is sufficient and water-based samples can be easily handled. Mass spectrometry, o...|$|R
40|$|The {{companion}} {{article by}} Rosenberg and Gollub {{in this issue}} summarizes data from 10 observational studies and concludes that female-controlled contraceptive methods, under typical conditions, are comparable to condoms in preventing sexually transmitted diseases and should be merchandized as such. While we agree that <b>chemical</b> and mechanical <b>contraceptives</b> provide protection against some sexually transmitted diseases, we think the authors have overstated the scientific case for these methods, especially {{in comparison with the}} condom. We think the current data remain inconclusive regarding the absolute protection of spermicides against the human immunodeficiency virus and their level of protection [...] relative to that of the condom [...] against other sexually transmitted diseases. Three reasons account for our differences: the limitations in the comparative data; the reported adverse effects of spermicides on vaginal conditions, including genital ulcers; and the relative value of condoms, even under typical conditions, in preventing sexually transmitted diseases. For these reasons, we would currently counsel both women and men who practice high-risk sexual behaviors to use condoms as their first line of defense. If this is unacceptable, the female barriers become a fallback position to protect against bacterial sexually transmitted diseases...|$|R
