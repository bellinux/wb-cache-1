25|$|The Staines Moor SSSI also {{includes}} King George VI Reservoir {{which is to}} the east. The reservoir carries nationally important wintering populations of tufted ducks, pochard, goosander and <b>common</b> <b>goldeneye.</b> The moor is separated from Wraysbury Reservoir to the west by the M25 and a footpath-accessible viaduct once used by the short-lived Staines and West Drayton Railway.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is known}} for its {{diversity}} of birds, with 212 species having been recorded as of 1987. Of these, 68 commonly breed, 30 breed occasionally, and 14 which have bred previously. Common birds include the black-throated loon, the bean goose and various species of ducks. Egg-gathering was previously popular from the <b>common</b> <b>goldeneye.</b> Common predator birds include the rough-legged buzzard and merlin, while the white-tailed eagle and golden eagle are less common. The short-eared owl is the most common owl. Waders are abundant along the river, the most common being common ringed plover, ruff and spotted redshank. Other common birds are the common gull, Arctic tern and sparrows.|$|E
50|$|Birds are various: <b>common</b> <b>goldeneyes,</b> mallards, gadwalls, {{northern}} pintails, anas, ruddy shelducks, charadrii, northern lapwings, common sandpipers, green sandpipers. Ducks are massively presents in automn on the lakes, during migration period.|$|R

25|$|Right and Left is a 1909 oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by the American artist Winslow Homer. It depicts a pair of <b>common</b> <b>goldeneye</b> ducks at the moment they are hit by a hunter's shotgun blast {{as they attempt to}} take flight. Completed less than two years before his death, it was Homer's last great painting, and {{has been the subject of}} a variety of interpretations regarding its origin, composition and meaning. As with his other late masterworks, it represents a return to the sporting and hunting subjects of Homer's earlier years, and was to be his final engagement with the theme. Its design recalls that of Japanese art, and the composition resembles that of a colored engraving by John James Audubon.|$|E
500|$|Birds, {{such as the}} <b>common</b> <b>goldeneye,</b> indigobirds, whydahs, honeyguides, cowbirds and New World cuckoos, {{that lay}} their eggs in other birds' nests, {{in order to have}} their chicks [...] through , by the parents of another bird, often of another species.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{birds are}} mallard and common gull, but other {{species such as}} <b>common</b> <b>goldeneye,</b> common tern, {{and a couple of}} black-throated diver are {{breeding}} by the lake and herons and ospreys are feeding in the area. [...] Trees by the lake shores also attract long-tailed tit and lesser spotted woodpecker, and occasionally whooper swan, and great crested grebe are reported by the lake.|$|E
5|$|Mallards are opportunistically {{targeted}} by brood parasites, occasionally having eggs laid in their nests by redheads, ruddy ducks, lesser scaup, gadwalls, northern shovellers, northern pintails, cinnamon teal, <b>common</b> <b>goldeneyes,</b> and other mallards. These eggs are generally accepted when they resemble the eggs {{of the host}} mallard, but the hen may attempt to eject them or even abandon the nest if parasitism occurs during egg laying.|$|R
50|$|Winter {{residents}} include large {{flocks of}} ducks, geese, and swans {{winter in the}} Sound. In West Haven, Connecticut 8,000 scaup (also called broadbills or bluebills) were regularly counted in the 1970s. Greater scaup, black ducks, mallards, and Canada geese are the most abundant wintering birds. There are also significant populations of red-breasted mergansers, <b>common</b> <b>goldeneyes,</b> buffleheads, scoters, American wigeons (also sometimes called baldpate), canvasbacks, oldsquaws and mute swans. Others (less abundant) include gadwalls, northern pintails, green-winged teal, northern shovelers (also sometimes called broadbill), ruddy ducks, redheads, ring-necked ducks, snow geese, and brant.|$|R
5|$|Every spring {{over two}} million {{waterfowl}} pass Matsalu, including 10,000—20,000 Bewick's swans, 10,000 greater scaups, <b>common</b> <b>goldeneyes,</b> tufted ducks, goosanders and many others. A colony {{of up to}} 20,000 barnacle geese, over 10,000 greylag geese and thousands of waders stop on the coastal pastures in spring. The most numerous birds of passage (around 1.6 million) are long-tailed ducks. Approximately 35,000—40,000 ducks feed in the reedbeds in spring. In autumn, about 300,000 migratory waterfowl pass Matsalu. The wetland is the biggest autumn stopping ground of common cranes in Europe. The highest recorded number of cranes at the park has been 23,000.|$|R
2500|$|German {{military}} intelligence in World War II {{referred to the}} two main production families as T-34/76 and T-34/85, with subvariants receiving letter designations such as T-34/76A — this nomenclature has been widely used in the West, especially in popular literature. When the German Wehrmacht used captured T-34s, it designated them Panzerkampfwagen T-34(r), where the [...] "r" [...] stood for russisch ("Russian"). The Finns referred to the T-34 as the Sotka after the <b>common</b> <b>goldeneye,</b> because the side silhouette of the tank resembled a swimming waterfowl. The T-34-85 was called pitkäputkinen Sotka ("long-barreled Sotka").|$|E
2500|$|The Goose Lake Valley is on {{the western}} flyway from Mexico to bird {{breeding}} grounds in the Arctic. [...] During the spring, Canada geese, snow geese, Ross' geese, and whistling swans stops in the valley to feed and rest before continuing north. Numerous shorebirds also migrate though the valley. These include black-necked stilts, American avocets, spotted sandpipers, Wilson's phalaropes, red-necked phalaropes, black terns, eared grebes, horned grebes, and cinnamon teal. [...] In the fall, these birds pass through the valley on their way south. [...] In addition, a number of bird species nest in the areas around Goose Lake. [...] Shorebirds such as American avocets, willets, killdeer, western grebe, and long-billed curlew nest near the lake. [...] The wetlands north of the lake provide breeding areas for Canada geese and sandhill cranes as well as mallard and other duck species. [...] The north shore wetlands are also an important breeding area for Clark's grebes, white-faced ibis, and great egret. [...] Tundra swans and American white pelicans use the area as well. [...] The lake supported a winter populations of over 10,000 Canada geese. [...] Barrow's goldeneye and <b>common</b> <b>goldeneye</b> also winter in the area.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to the <b>common</b> <b>goldeneye.</b> On average, adult males are 48.8 centimeters (19.2 inches) long and weigh 1.0 kilograms (2.13 lb); females are typically 43.2 centimeters (17.0 inches) long and weigh 0.6 kilograms (1.31 pounds). Adult males have a dark head with a purplish gloss and a white crescent {{at the front of}} the face. Adult females have a mostly yellow bill. The male Barrow's goldeneye differs from the male <b>common</b> <b>goldeneye</b> in the fact that the <b>common</b> <b>goldeneye</b> has a round white patches on the face, less black on the back of the bird, and a larger bill. For the females, the <b>common</b> <b>goldeneye</b> has a less rounded head, and a bill in which only the tip is yellow.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to fish, the lake provides habitat {{for a wide}} variety of bird species. From the Forest Service campgrounds along the lake shore, birdwatchers can view waterfowl, songbirds, and birds of prey. Common waterfowl include red-necked grebes, Pacific loons, common loons, hooded mergansers, red-breasted mergansers, lesser scaup, surf scoters, white-winged scoters, <b>common</b> <b>goldeneyes,</b> and Barrow's goldeneyes. The lake also attracts birds of prey such as red-tailed hawk, osprey and bald eagles.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand the pattern of variation in group structure and feeding behaviour of wintering <b>Common</b> <b>Goldeneyes</b> (Bucephala clangula) on the Saint-Lawrence River, by comparing two major habitats for this species in the province of Quebec, one in freshwater and one in saltwater. Groups of goldeneyes were smaller in Montreal than in the estuary and consisted of twice as many males. Individuals spent a greater proportion of time feeding in Montreal than in the estuary. At Montreal, goldeneyes spent more time feeding under water. Temporal variables had a major influence on group structure and on diving time. At Montreal, time of day explained most of variation whereas in the estuary, tide was more important...|$|R
50|$|The lake {{measures}} 450 by 400 metres. The southern shore {{is formed}} by a constructed wetland used for water purification. Large numbers of waterfowl {{may be found}} here and along the swampy eastern shore during the winter season (e.g. greylag geese, wigeons, <b>common</b> <b>goldeneyes).</b> The local angling club has released carps into the lake. A sandy beach measuring some 300 m was created at the western shore. An area sufficiently shallow to accommodate safe swimming by inexperienced bathers is cordoned off. Furthermore, a grassy sunbathing area sporting a public toilet adjoins the lake, {{as well as a}} children's adventure playground. The lake is only a short walking distance from Haarlem Spaarnwoude railway station and relatively close to the A200 and A9 motorways. This favourable location has helped to make it a popular area for organising mid to large-scale events. Thus, 2006 saw the Circus Herman Renz pitch its tent alongside the lake.|$|R

50|$|Often {{the natural}} tree {{cavities}} {{are made by}} broken limbs, unless they are made by pileated woodpeckers or black woodpeckers, the only tree-cavity-making animals who make a cavity large enough to normally accommodate a goldeneye. Average egg size is a breadth of 43.3 mm, a length of 59.3 mm and a weight of 64 g. The incubation period ranges from 28 to 32 days. The female does all the incubating and is abandoned by the male about 1 to 2 weeks into incubation. The young remain in the nest for about 24-36 hours. Brood parasitism is quite common both with other <b>common</b> <b>goldeneyes</b> {{as well as with}} other duck species, and even tree swallow and European starling eggs have been found mixed with goldeneye eggs. The broods commonly start to mix with other females' broods as they become more independent.

40|$|Saline lakes {{provide a}} prey-rich, predator-free {{environment}} for birds to utilize during migration and stopover periods. The Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah {{is the largest}} salt lake in North America and is utilized by millions of migratory birds. It also is host to multiple commercial endeavors. Proposed expansion of commercial use of the GSL would result in increased impounded area and water extraction for mineral production, which may increase the GSL’s salinity and negatively impact invertebrate abundance. I review previous literature and synthesize diets of avian species utilizing the GSL to determine the importance of each invertebrate species, including brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) and brine flies (Ephydra spp.), and clarify the anthropogenic impacts on food sources and avian populations. Species considered are eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis), northern shovelers (Anas clypeata), green-winged teals (Anas crecca), <b>common</b> <b>goldeneyes</b> (Bucephala clangula), American avocets (Recurvirostra americana), black-necked stilts (Himantopus mexicanus), Wilson’s phalaropes (Phalaropus tricolor), red-necked phalaropes (Phalaropus lobatus), and California gulls (Larus californicus). Brine shrimp and brine fly adults are consumed by all species considered.

40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} experienced {{early in}} life may have long-term impacts on life history traits and reproductive performance. We investigated whether ambient temperature experienced {{during the first two}} to four weeks of life and weather severity during the first two winters affected recruitment age and relative timing of breeding in the year of recruitment in female <b>common</b> <b>goldeneyes</b> Bucephala clangula. Our sample consisted of 141 female recruits hatched in a study population in central Finland between 1985 and 2013 and captured later as breeders. About 56 % of the recruited females bred for the first time when two years old (range 2 – 6 yr). Individuals facing colder ambient temperatures during the first two to four weeks posthatch or more severe winter conditions during the first two winters did not recruit at an older age. Nor did maternal characteristics, relative hatch date or nest site availability affect recruitment age. For females that recruited at two years old, the date of first breeding was usually late relative to the population mean that year (mean difference 6. 9 d, range – 7 to 21 d). Our results suggest developmental buffering enables female goldeneye ducklings to mitigate the impacts of adverse environmental conditions experienced during the first weeks of life, {{at least in terms of}} first breeding...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Although {{numbers of}} buffleheads (Bucephala albeola), <b>common</b> <b>goldeneyes</b> (Bucephala clangula) and long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis) over-wintering on Lake Ontario have {{increased}} sub-stantially {{over the past}} two decades, factors influencing habitat use and the potential for competition have not been investigated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship between prey availability and community structure of diving ducks during winter on northeastern Lake Ontario. Ben-thic and nektonic samples collected during fall, winter, and spring 2002 – 2004 indicated that macroinver-tebrate numbers differed by location but generally did not decline throughout winter. Large accumula-tions of macroinvertebrates, apparently moved by wave action and currents, were documented in nearshore areas. Surveys showed that diving ducks congregated in mixed species flocks within areas of higher food abundance. Mixed species flocks were common in nearshore areas, likely because energy-dense foods (Amphipoda and Chironomidae) were abundant in the narrow zone of shallow water, close to shore. Although macroinvertebrate numbers likely affected habitat use by diving ducks, birds did not greatly reduce abundance of macroinvertebrates. It is unlikely that exploitative competition was occur-ring and interference competition appeared below threshold levels that would cause species to spatially segregate. Overall, our results suggest that food availability is not a limiting factor for buffleheads, com-mon goldeneyes, or long-tailed ducks wintering on northeastern Lake Ontario...|$|R
