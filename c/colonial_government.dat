5|$|In late 1774, Colonial leaders {{adopted the}} Suffolk Resolves in {{resistance}} to the alterations made to the Massachusetts <b>colonial</b> <b>government</b> by the British parliament following the Boston Tea Party. The colonial assembly responded by forming a Patriot provisional government known as the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and calling for local militias to train for possible hostilities. The <b>Colonial</b> <b>government</b> exercised effective control of the colony outside of British-controlled Boston. In response, the British government in February 1775 declared Massachusetts {{to be in a}} state of rebellion.|$|E

5|$|During Western Australia's convict era, {{the prison}} {{was known as}} the Convict Establishment, and was used for prisoners transported from Britain. Longer term locally-sentenced prisoners were also held there from 1858, at a cost to the <b>colonial</b> <b>government.</b> In 1868, penal {{transportation}} to Western Australia ceased, and the number of convicts in the colony gradually declined, down to 83 in the mid-1880s. Due to the great expense of sending these convicts back to Britain, the authorities there negotiated with the <b>colonial</b> <b>government</b> to relinquish jurisdiction over them, as well as the prison complex – demolition was considered too expensive. Early negotiations had broken down, but were restarted in August 1883. After one and a half years, a compromise was reached, and the transfer was finalised on 31 March 1886.|$|E

5|$|Like much of {{the rest}} of French West Africa, the colony had a number of {{policies}} regarding Islam and the Muslim communities.

5|$|The {{existence}} of the Kangchu was not recognised by the British <b>colonial</b> <b>government,</b> even though they exercised a similar degree of autonomy as their counterparts in Johor. Nevertheless, the Kangchu in Singapore had easy access to forested land in Singapore compared to their counterparts in Johor, as the British <b>colonial</b> <b>government</b> adopted a laissez-faire attitude to the Kangchu and imposed very little regulation on their agricultural activities. However, the British were wary {{of the fact that}} many Kangchu in Singapore were members of the Ngee Heng Kongsi, which was illegal in Singapore and enjoyed monopoly rights over the regional opium trade. The British appointed a Chinese official among the Kangchu to oversee the social and economic affairs of the gambier and pepper plantations in Singapore and to act as the intermediary.|$|E

Partly due to a political reorganization that was a result of the Durham Report, Scarborough gained elected representation on the Home District Council. Scarborough elected two councillors.|$|E
