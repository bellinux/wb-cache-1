40|$|Background: The {{assessment}} of patient <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> focuses on measuring {{various aspects of}} the health status of a patient who is under healthcare intervention. Patient <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> assessment is a very significant process in the clinical field as it allows health care professionals to better understand the effectiveness of their health care programs and thus for enhancing the health care quality in general. It is thus vital that a high quality, informative review of current issues regarding the {{assessment of}} patient <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> should be conducted. Aims & Objectives: 1) Summarizes the advantages of the assessment of patient clinical outcome; 2) reviews some of the existing patient <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> assessment models namely: Simulation, Markov, Bayesian belief networks, Bayesian statistics and Conventional statistics, and Kaplan-Meier analysis models; and 3) demonstrates the desired features that should be fulfilled by a well-established ideal patient <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> assessment model. Material & Methods: An integrative review of the literature has been performed using the Google Scholar to explore the field of patient <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> assessment. Conclusion: This paper will directly support researchers, clinicians and health care professionals in their understanding of developments in the domain of the assessment of patient <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome,</b> thus enabling them to propose ideal assessment models. </p...|$|R
40|$|As it {{is often}} assumed that delayed {{cerebral}} ischemia (DCI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is caused by vasospasm, clinical trials often focus on prevention of vasospasm with the aim to improve <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome.</b> However, the role of vasospasm in the pathogenesis of DCI and <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> is possibly smaller than previously assumed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that studied the effect of pharmaceutical preventive strategies on vasospasm, DCI, and <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> in SAH patients to further investigate the relationship between vasospasm and <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome.</b> Effect sizes were expressed in pooled risk ratio (RR) estimates with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI). A total of 14 studies randomizing 4, 235 patients were included. Despite a reduction of vasospasm (RR 0. 80 (95 % CI 0. 70 to 0. 92)), no statistically significant effect on poor outcome was observed (RR 0. 93 (95 % CI 0. 85 to 1. 03)). The variety of DCI definitions did not justify pooling the DCI data. We conclude that pharmaceutical treatments have significantly decreased the incidence of vasospasm, but not of poor <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome.</b> This dissociation between vasospasm and <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> could result from methodological problems, sample size, insensitivity of <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> measures, or from mechanisms other than vasospasm that also contribute to poor outcome.

Following that, the effects of neutrophil depletion through leukocyte filters are examined. Neutrophil responses were assessed preoperatively (n= 40) through change in neutrophil adhesion molecule [CD 11 b, CD 62 L and P Selectin Glycoprotein- 1 (PSGL- 1) ] expression before and after in-vitro stimulation with Phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate, PMA (1 Â ng/ml), lipopolysaccharide, LPS (1 Â Î¼g/ml) and N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, fMLP (1 Â ng/ml). Stimulated neutrophil responses were then correlated with postoperative <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome.</b> Patients were then randomised to leukocyte filtration (n= 20) and a control group (n= 20) and the effect of leukocyte filtration on neutrophil response and <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> were investigated. An individual variation in in-vitro stimulated neutrophil responses was demonstrated. Significant correlations were shown between neutrophil responses and maximum serum creatinine change, CKMB-fraction, adrenaline requirement, noradrenaline requirement, duration of adrenaline required and time to extubation.

25|$|As {{with mild}} acute pancreatitis, {{it will be}} {{necessary}} to treat the underlying causeâgallstones, discontinuing medications, cessation of alcohol, etc. If the cause is gallstones, it is likely that an ERCP procedure or removal of the gallbladder will be recommended. The gallbladder should be removed during the same hospital admission or within two weeks of pancreatitis onset so as to limit the risk of recurrent pancreatitis. If the cause of pancreatitis is alcohol, cessation of alcohol consumption and treatment for alcohol dependency may improve pancreatitis. Even if the underlying cause is not related to alcohol consumption, doctors recommend avoiding it for at least six months as this can cause further damage to the pancreas during the recovery process. Oral intake, especially fats, is generally restricted initially but early enteral feeding within 48 hours has been shown to improve <b>clinical</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Fluids and electrolytes are replaced intravenously.

25|$|However, the {{concentration}} of LDL particles, {{and to a lesser}} extent their size, has a stronger and consistent correlation with individual clinical outcome than the amount of cholesterol within LDL particles, even if the LDL-C estimation is approximately correct. There is increasing evidence and recognition of the value of more targeted and accurate measurements of LDL particles. Specifically, LDL particle number (concentration), {{and to a lesser extent}} size, have shown slightly stronger correlations with atherosclerotic progression and cardiovascular events than obtained using chemical measures of the amount of cholesterol carried by the LDL particles. It is possible that the LDL cholesterol concentration can be low, yet LDL particle number high and cardiovascular events rates are high. Correspondingly, it is possible that LDL cholesterol concentration can be relatively high, yet LDL particle number low and cardiovascular events are also low. If LDL particle concentration is used to predict cardiovascular events, many other correlates of these <b>clinical</b> <b>outcomes,</b> such as diabetes mellitus, obesity and smoking, lose most of their predictive accuracy.|$|E
40|$|Malnutrition and {{its impact}} on <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> may be underestimated in hospitalised elderly as many {{screening}} procedures require measurements of weight and height that cannot often be undertaken in sick elderly patients.

In the present study, 150 consecutively admitted elderly patients (age 85 (sd 5 Â· 5) years) were recruited prospectively, screened with `MUST' and <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> recorded. Although only 56 ?% of patients could be weighed, all (n 150) could be screened with `MUST'; 58 ?% were at malnutrition risk and these individuals had greater mortality (in-hospital and post-discharge, P< 0 Â· 01) and longer hospital stays (P= 0 Â· 02) than those at low risk. Both `MUST' categorisation and component scores (BMI, weight loss, acute disease) were significantly related to mortality (P< 0 Â· 03). Those patients with no measured or recalled weight (`MUST' subjective criteria used) had a greater risk of malnutrition (P= 0 Â· 01) and a poorer <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> (P< 0 Â· 002) than those who could be weighed and, within both groups, <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> was worse in those at risk of malnutrition. The present study suggests that `MUST' predicts <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> in hospitalised elderly, in whom malnutrition is common (58 ?%).

40|$|BackgroundâThe role of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (proBNP) for the {{prediction}} of <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> has not been examined in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Methods and ResultsâProBNP levels were measured in 73 patients with acute PE within 4 hours of admission. Adverse <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> was defined as in-hospital death or the need for at least 1 of the following: cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, pressors, thrombolysis, catheter fragmentation, or surgical embolectomy. In the 53 patients with a benign <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome,</b> proBNP (median 121, range 16 to 34 802 pg/mL) was lower than in 20 patients with adverse <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> (median 4250, range 92 to 49 607 pg/mL; P 0. 0001). The negative predictive value of proBNP levels 500 pg/mL to predict adverse <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> was 97 % (95 % confidence interval 84 to 99). ProBNP remained an independent predictor for adverse <b>clinical</b> <b>outcome</b> (odds ratio 14. 6; 95 % confidence interval 1. 5 to 139. 0; P 0. 02) after adjusting for severity of PE (submassive/massive), troponin T levels 0. 01 ng/mL, age 70 years, gender, and history of congestive heart failure.
