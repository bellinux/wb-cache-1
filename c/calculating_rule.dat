This gives us expectation maximization training for any grammar class with a parsing algorithm that can be stated as a deductive system, for free. Having such a framework in place accelerates turnover time for experimenting with new grammar classes and parsing algorithms—to implement a grammar learner, only the parse forest construction has to be implemented. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Previous case-based {{reasoning}} research makes {{a compelling case}} {{for the importance of}} CBR systems determining the system’s confidence in its con-clusions, and has developed useful analyses of how characteristics of individual cases and the case base as a whole influence confidence. This paper argues that in systems which perform case adaptation, an important additional indicator for solution confidence is confidence in the adaptations performed. Assessing con-fidence of adaptation rules may be particularly important when knowledge-light methods are applied to generate adaptations automatically from the case base, giving the opportunity to improve performance by astute rule selection. The pa-per proposes a new method for <b>calculating</b> <b>rule</b> confidence for automatically-generated adaptation rules for regression tasks, when the rules are generated by the common “difference heuristic ” method of comparing pairs of cases in a case base, and a method for confidence-influenced selection of cases to adapt. The method is evaluated in four domains, showing performance gains over baseline methods and case based regression without using confidence knowledge. ...|$|E

40|$|Many of our {{concepts}} {{are introduced to}} us via, and seem only to be constrained by, roughand-ready explanations and some sample paradigm positive and negative applications. This happens even in informal logic and mathematics. Yet in some cases, the concepts in question – although only informally and vaguely characterized – in fact have, or appear to have, entirely determinate extensions. Here’s one familiar example. When we start learning computability theory, we are introduced {{to the idea of}} an algorithmically computable function (from numbers to numbers) – i. e. one whose value for any given input can be determined by a step-by-step calculating procedure, where each step is fully determined by some antecedently given finite set of <b>calculating</b> <b>rules.</b> We are told that we are to abstract from practical considerations of how many steps will be needed and how much ink will be spilt in the process, so long as everything remains finite. We are also told that each step is to be ‘small’ and the rules governing it must be ‘simple’, available to a cognitively limited calculating agent: for we want an algorithmic procedure, step-by-minimal-step, to be idiot-proof.

40|$|Abstract: To {{overcome}} {{the difficulty in}} understanding quantitative evaluation on actually safety assessment, This research proposed a qualitative comprehensive assessment method of fuzzy state based on fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Transform. First of all, the fuzzy comment of multiple assessments by experts {{should focus on the}} quantitative evaluation of corresponding triangular fuzzy numbers, so that fuzzy evaluation matrix on fuzzy AHP can be formed. Meanwhile, the weight of evaluation index regarding the evaluation target is calculated according to the <b>calculating</b> <b>rules</b> of fuzzy numbers and fuzzy AHP. Secondly, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of evaluation target can be acquired based on the score of evaluation index state and the weight of evaluation index of the evaluation target. In addition, the total evaluation range of evaluation target by using corresponding interval between evaluation target and fuzzy grade are calculated. Finally, the final fuzzy qualitative evaluation value of system is determined using the principle of maximum membership degree in fuzzy grade interval. The hoisting mechanism system of crane is taken as an example to explain the solving process and feasibility of this method. This method assesses the comprehensive state of system. The assessment process is being qualitative to quantitative, then back to qualitative. And it enables non-professional...|$|R
40|$|Researchers in Distributed &tificial Intelligence have {{suggested}} {{that it would be}} worthwhile to isolate “aspects of cooperative behavior, ” general rules that cause agents to act in ways conducive to cooperation. One kind of cooperative behav-ior is when agents independently alter the envi-ronment {{to make it easier for}} everyone to func-tion effectively. Cooperative behavior of this kind might be to put away a hammer that one finds lying on the floor, knowing that another agent will be able to find it more easily later on. We examine the effect a specific “cooperation rule ” has on agents in the multi-agent Tileworld domain. Agents are encouraged to increase tiles’ degrees of freedom, even when the tile is not involved in an agent’s own primary plan. The amount of extra work an agent is willing to do is captured in the agent’s cooperation level. Re-sults from simulations are presented. We present a way of characterizing domains as multi-agent deterministic finite automata, and characterizing cooperative rules as transformations of these au-tomata. We also discuss general characteristics of cooperative state-changing rules. It is shown that a relatively simple, easily <b>calculated</b> <b>rule</b> can sometimes improve global system performance in the Tileworld.
