The project has undertaken {{the evaluation of}} QoS charging approaches independently developed by BT Labs in collaboration with UCL and by DT T-Nova in collaboration with GMD FOKUS. The objective of both efforts was to design, specify, prototype and evaluate QoS charging solutions. Despite {{the fact that some}} vendors are already offering QoS <b>charging</b> <b>products</b> on a commercial basis, it becomes clear from this document that these products cover only parts of the system a provider would {{need to be able to}} charge for QoS enabled IP services efficiently.

50|$|Although {{particles}} {{as large}} as argon nuclei may be produced as the smaller (third) <b>charged</b> <b>product</b> in the usual ternary fission, the most common small fragments from ternary fission are helium-4 nuclei, which make up about 90% of the small fragment products. This high incidence {{is related to the}} stability (high binding energy) of the alpha particle, which makes more energy available to the reaction. The second-most common particles produced in ternary fission are tritons (the nuclei of tritium), which make up 7% of the total small fragments, and the third-most are helium-6 nuclei (which decay in about 0.8 seconds to lithium-6). Protons and larger nuclei are in the small fraction (< 2%) which make up the remainder of the small <b>charged</b> <b>products.</b> The two larger charged particles from ternary fission, particularly when alphas are produced, are quite similar in size distribution to those produced in binary fission.|$|R

The research was {{in the form of}} an exploratory study, which attempted to provide answers regarding this topic in a South African context, as previous research in this context is limited. The research was executed through the use of a questionnaire with 223 respondents were initially required to view a number scenes that were extracted from films that were targeted to this age group. It was found that there is no statistically significant difference in the acceptability between male and female film attendees with regard to tobacco products, alcoholic beverage products in films. There is no difference in the acceptance of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages between males and females as the results show neutral opinions from both of these groups, therefore they may not be easily persuaded to buy the branded products advertised. However, the acceptance of weapons between males and females does show a significant difference as females have a more negative opinion than the neutral opinion of males.
