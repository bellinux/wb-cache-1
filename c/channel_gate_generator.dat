Site-specific mutations of Phe 168 to a small amino acid resulted in losses of the ATP- and proton-dependent <b>gating,</b> whereas the <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> was well maintained after mutation to a bulky tryptophan, supporting the steric hindrance effect.

A key region for this communication is located within the structural transition zone between the ligand-binding and pore domains. Here, stemming from β-strand 10 of the binding domain, the invariant αArg 209 lodges within the hydrophobic interior of the subunit and is essential for rapid and efficient <b>channel</b> <b>gating.</b> Previous charge-reversal experiments showed that the contribution of αArg 209 to <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> depends strongly on αGlu 45, also within this region. Here we determine whether the contribution of αArg 209 to <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> depends on additional anionic or electron-rich residues in this region. Also, to reconcile diverging findings in the literature, we compare the dependence of αArg 209 on αGlu 45 in AChRs from different species, and compare the full agonist ACh with the weak agonist choline. Our findings reveal that the contribution of αArg 209 to <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> depends on additional nearby electron-rich residues, consistent with both electrostatic and steric contributions. Furthermore, αArg 209 and αGlu 45 show a strong interdependence in both human and mouse AChRs, whereas the functional consequences of the mutation αE 45 R depend on the agonist.

We introduce and validate new computational tools that enable efficient generation and simulation of models containing stochastic ion channels distributed across dendritic and axonal membranes.

The reduction of ON charge by holding potential in this range matches inactivation of Na current measured in the same cells, suggesting that this component might arise from Na <b>channel</b> <b>gating.</b> The ON charge remaining at a holding potential of- 50 mV has properties expected of Ca <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> current: it is greatly reduced by application of 10 /zM D 600 when accompanied by long depolarizations and it is reduced at more positive holding potentials with a voltage dependence {{similar to that of}} Ca channel inactivation. However, the D 600 -sensitive charge movement is much larger than the Ca <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> current that would be expected if the movement of <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> charge were always accompanied by complete opening of the channel...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of human ether-à-go-go-related gene (HERG) K+ channel blockade by the antifungal agent ketoconazole was investigated using patch-clamp recording from mammalian cell lines. Ketoconazole inhibited whole-cell HERG current (IHERG) with a clinically relevant half-maximal inhibitory drug concentration (IC 50) value of 1. 7 μM. The voltage- and time-dependent characteristics of IHERG blockade by ketoconazole indicated dependence of block on <b>channel</b> <b>gating,</b> ruling out {{a significant role}} for closed-state channel inhibition. The S 6 HERG mutations Y 652 A and F 656 A produced ∼ 4 -fold and ∼ 21 -fold increases in IC 50 for IHERG blockade, respectively. Thus, ketoconazole accesses the HERG channel pore-cavity on <b>channel</b> <b>gating,</b> and the S 6 residue F 656 is an important determinant of ketoconazole binding...|$|R
40|$|SecY is {{the central}} channel protein of the SecYEbeta translocon, the {{structure}} {{of which has been}} determined by X-ray diffraction. Extended (15 ns) MD simulations of the isolated SecY protein in a phospholipid bilayer have been performed to explore the relationship between protein flexibility and the mechanisms of <b>channel</b> <b>gating.</b> In particular, principal components analysis of the simulation trajectory has been used to probe the intrinsic flexibility of the isolated SecY protein {{in the absence of the}} gamma-subunit (SecE) clamp. Analysis and visualization of the principal eigenvectors support a "plug and clamshell" model of SecY <b>channel</b> <b>gating.</b> The simulation results also indicate that hydrophobic gating at the central pore ring prevents leakage of water and ions through the channel in the absence of a translocating peptide...|$|R
