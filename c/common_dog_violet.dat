50|$|Much of Gillies Hill {{has been}} {{classified}} as a Semi-natural Ancient Woodland by Woodland Trust aerial Inventories. This means that its understory of plant species has been more or less continuous for hundreds of years. Plants such as wood sorrel, <b>common</b> <b>dog</b> <b>violets,</b> and English bluebells most likely existed on the hill {{at the time of}} Robert the Bruce, and perhaps as far back as Iron Age Scotland. Areas of the hill which have been re-planted or coppiced (pruned to supply long thin sprouts) or harvested for timber, may still have relatively undisturbed underlying vegetation containing species which take years to become established residents of the forest.|$|R

50|$|This is a {{woodland}} site {{next to the}} River Mel, {{with trees}} such as ash, hawthorn, sycamore, beech and silver birch. Ground flora include <b>dog</b> <b>violet</b> and cow parsley, while traveller's joy provides food for moths. Tawny owls and pipistrelle bats roost on ivy.|$|R
60|$|X. VIOLA CANINA. <b>Dog</b> <b>Violet.</b> I {{have taken}} it for {{analysis}} in my two plates, because its grace of form is too much despised, and we owe much more of the beauty of spring to it, in English mountain ground, than to the Regina.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{species of}} orchid thrive in Garston Wood, [...] along with lesser celandine, butcher's broom, wood anemone, <b>dog</b> <b>violet,</b> primrose, wild garlic, the rare toothwort and bluebells.

50|$|Viola riviniana, {{the common}} dog-violet, is {{a species of}} the genus Viola native to Eurasia and Africa. It is also called wood <b>violet</b> and <b>dog</b> <b>violet.</b> It is a {{perennial}} herb of woodland edges, grassland and shady hedge banks. It is found in all soils except acid or very wet.|$|R
50|$|The pale <b>dog</b> <b>violet</b> (Viola lactea) is {{particularly}} {{dependent on the}} heathland whilst the pillwort, slender centaury and chamomile thrive on winter-wet disturbed ground near and on paths and tracks. Floating water plants need areas of open water at least ankle-deep in summer and without too much organic matter. Natural Resources Wales attempts to encourage these conditions.|$|R
5000|$|The genus {{includes}} <b>dog</b> <b>violets,</b> a {{group of}} scentless species which {{are the most common}} Viola in many areas, sweet violet (Viola odorata) (named from its sweet scent), and many other species whose common name includes the word [...] "violet". Several species are known as pansies, including the yellow pansy (Viola pedunculata) of the Pacific coast.|$|R
5000|$|Over half {{this site}} is managed as farmland, {{and the rest}} is ancient oak {{woodland}} also has coppiced sweet chestnut and hornbeam, with an understorey of ash, elder and hazel. Invertebrates include damselflies, dragonflies, glow-worms and wood ants. Common blooms found on the reserve in the summer include Bluebells, Bugles, Cuckoo Flowers, Wood Anemones, Primroses, <b>Dog</b> <b>Violets,</b> and Wood Sorrels.|$|R
50|$|In the UK and Canada {{this species}} uses {{several species of}} violet as its food plant. In drier areas, <b>dog</b> <b>violets</b> are used whilst in wetter areas the food plant is bog violet (Viola palustris) or marsh violet growing amongst purple moor-grass or tufted hair-grass. They prefer the damper areas more often. They also occur amongst bracken, where this is shading the {{appropriate}} violet species.|$|R
50|$|Woodland plants include wood sorrel, blackthorn, bird's nest orchid, wood anemone, bluebell, wood avens, bugle, ramsons, self-heal, <b>dog</b> <b>violet,</b> honeysuckle, holly, lords and ladies, {{herb robert}} and woody nightshade. Woods {{dominated}} by oak and birch, with lesser amounts of rowan, holly, hazel, yew and aspen are called western oakwoods and occur principally in the uplands of Ireland, Scotland and Wales. They are temperate rainforests.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>dogs,</b> the <b>violet</b> or supracaudal gland {{is found}} {{approximately}} above the 9th caudal vertebra, but depending on breed {{it may be}} vestigial or entirely absent. The violet gland secretes protein and hydrophobic lipids, has wide excretory ducts, is connected with coarse hairs, devoid of cysts, and has no sexual dimorphism. In the dog and cat fancy it {{is often referred to}} as [...] "stud tail", despite the fact that it occurs in all sexes, not just breeding males. However, for reasons still unknown the hair at a <b>dog's</b> <b>violet</b> gland tends to fall out when androgen levels are high over a prolonged time. In short-haired breeds the usually inconspicuous gland may thus appear as a noticeably sparsely haired patch, and it is this condition of the gland area that is most frequent in stud dogs.|$|R
50|$|Hazel and {{hawthorn}} scrub {{is widespread}} on relatively dry sites with bramble, false brome, wood sedge, violet, bluebell, wild hyacinth and primrose. Where such communities occur on a rocky shore crab apple often grows with roses and <b>dog</b> <b>violet.</b> The scrub grades into woodland {{in several places}} on the southern shore and here ash and oak occur with holly. The bird community in such sites include treecreeper, long-tailed tit, chiffchaff, willow warbler and locally blackcap, woodpigeon, sparrowhawk, jay, pheasant and woodcock are also found.|$|R

5000|$|Most turloughs have a springy, short-cropped turf of grasses, sedges, and herbs. In the Burren, the {{high-water mark}} is often {{shown by the}} shrubby {{cinquefoil}} (...) with its attractive yellow flowers, and meadow rue. Just below the high-water mark, <b>dog</b> <b>violets</b> are abundant and in some turloughs {{there may be a}} dense sward of the rare sky-blue turlough violet about one metre further down. Other characteristic plants of turlough sides include marsh orchids and speedwell. About halfway down the sides, and across the bottom of shallow turloughs, silverweed (...) may blanket almost all other plants.|$|R

40|$|We {{analysed}} phenological {{observations of}} first flowering of early <b>dog</b> <b>violet</b> Viola reichenbachiana and horse chestnut Aesculus hippocastanum at similar latitudes (and hence photo-period) in the UK and Poland during the 26 years 1970 – 1995. Temperatures in Poland were significantly colder {{than in the}} UK for February and March and significantly warmer in May. Mean first flowering dates of both species {{were not significantly different}} between the 2 countries. However, records in the UK were significantly more variable. Both species in both locations showed significant temperature responsiveness although plants in the UK were more responsive than those in Poland. We conclude that locally adapted species may differ in their projected change under future climate warming...|$|R

Ancylostoma caninum, the <b>common</b> <b>dog</b> hookworm, occasionally develops into an adult to cause eosinophilic enteritis in people, but their invasive larvae can cause an itchy rash called cutaneous larva migrans.|$|R
50|$|A {{profusion of}} daffodils {{in early spring}} is welcomed by the residents. Marsh {{marigold}} by the river, wood sorrel and wood avens on the river bank. The caraway flower comes in summer in damp pasture near the river. The caraway is the county flower of Carmarthenshire and is similar in appearance to the lady's smock, or cuckoo flower. There are purple orchids near some silver leaf limes {{at the top of}} the village. The dominant trees are beech and ash and some sycamore and oaks to a lesser degree. Yellow pimpernel can be seen for short periods in shady banks under ash trees. Red campion, stitchwort and bluebell contribute a magnificent red, white and blue to the hedgerows in spring. <b>Dog</b> <b>violet</b> and birds foot trefoil grow for shorter periods.|$|R
5000|$|The female lays {{a single}} brood of {{eggs in the}} dried herbage of <b>violets,</b> {{especially}} western <b>dog</b> <b>violet</b> (Viola adunca), the only known larval food plant. Upon hatching, the caterpillars wander a short distance and spin silk pads upon which they pass the winter. The larvae immediately seek out the food plant {{at the end of}} their diapause in the spring. After 7 to 10 weeks each larva pupates within a chamber of leaves it glues together with silk. Adults may emerge in about 2 weeks and can live for 3 weeks. The adult flight season may range from late June to early September. Adults feed on nectar from flowers including gumplants (Grindelia spp.), yellow sand verbena (Abronia latifolia), coyote mints (Monardella spp., especially M. undulata), bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare) and seaside daisy (Erigeron glaucus).|$|R
50|$|Breed Clubs in European {{countries}} seldom have requirements, while <b>common</b> <b>dog</b> {{sports such}} as Schutzhund or IPO are not perfectly suitable for a Livestock Guardian dog. Some European Union Countries developed special tests for large breeds of dogs aiming to reveal a dog’s overall stability, such as The Mentality Assessment test in Sweden.|$|R
500|$|Writing in 1862, Benjamin Clarje {{considered}} {{the park to}} exhibit [...] "perhaps a richer display of varied landscape than any spot of similar size in the kingdom". He notes that the surface in the upper area of the park is [...] "diversified by gentle undulations and has been planted with great judgment and taste" [...] and that the River Towy flows in the vicinity. The Wildlife Trust West Wales acquired the nearby woodland in 1979. The BBC's Peter Crawford wrote of it in his book, The Living Isles: [...] "The woodland is primarily oak and wych elm," [...] he writes. [...] "The shrubs and ground cover are outstanding with cherry, holly, spindle, <b>dog</b> <b>violet</b> and the parasitic toothwort. Lichen communities are of importance and include the rare lungwort. Overlooked by the romantic Castle of Dinefwr the fine old parkland has a herd of fallow deer. The mature trees attract woodpecker, redstarts and pied flycatchers. In winter, the water meadows draw large numbers of ducks".|$|R
