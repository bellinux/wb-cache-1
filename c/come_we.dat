25|$|The {{target of}} the right-wing vested {{interests}} was a famous annual May Day celebration at the Portella della Ginestra. A {{few days before the}} festivities, Giuliano received a letter that was evidently the culmination of negotiations. After reading it, the bandit chieftain burned it and announced, “The hour of our liberation has <b>come.</b> <b>We</b> are going to attack the Communists, to go to fire on them on May 1 at Portella della Ginestra.” One of his bandits protested that women and children would be present. The chieftain replied that only leaders would be targeted. Giuliano's behavior before and after the armed action indicate that he believed that he and his men would be offered pardons for their crimes if all went well on May Day, an outcome ostensibly guaranteed by some prominent Sicilian. According to Giuliano's later statements, his main aim of the day was the capture of Girolamo Li Causi, head of the Communist party of Sicily—any other action was a diversionary tactic to facilitate Li Causi's capture. Although scheduled to speak, Li Causi did not attend.|$|E
500|$|Trenton lacked {{city walls}} or fortifications, which {{was typical of}} American settlements. [...] Some Hessian {{officers}} advised Rall to fortify the town, {{and two of his}} engineers advised that a redoubt be constructed at the upper end of town, and fortifications be built along the river. The engineers {{went so far as to}} draw up plans, but Rall disagreed with them. When Rall was again urged to fortify the town, he replied, [...] "Let them <b>come...</b> <b>We</b> will go at them with the bayonet." ...|$|E
500|$|The San Diego trio did however {{accumulate}} {{a genuine}} buzz among major labels, and {{a bidding war}} for the band began in March 1996. Several labels courted the band, sending A reps to shows and inviting the band to stop by the office for lunch meetings. Through the several labels interested, Blink-182 seriously considered Interscope, Epitaph, and MCA Records (the latter of which had just purchased Interscope {{and was in the}} process of buying Cargo). The band spent much time during the spring and summer of 1996 contemplating options. The three had no qualms signing to a major label, and were wary of purists attempting to define [...] "punk". The band felt a great affinity for Epitaph, as many of their favorite acts (Pennywise, Bad Religion, NOFX) were signed there. The band felt they were nothing but honest regarding their ambitions: [...] "I try and tell kids, 'The Clash, Sex Pistols and the Ramones did it, so how <b>come</b> <b>we</b> can't?" [...] guitarist Tom DeLonge reasoned. [...] "If people are bummed, we don't care. It's normally critics. Older critics." ...|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the time}} of Caesar, the phrase {{has been used in}} {{military}} contexts. King Jan III of Poland after the 17th-century Battle of Vienna, alluded to it, saying Venimus, Vidimus, Deus vicit ("We <b>came,</b> <b>We</b> saw, God conquered"). In 2011 then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, referred to the death of Muammar Gaddafi with a similar phrase, saying that [...] "We <b>came,</b> <b>we</b> saw, he died".|$|R
500|$|Despite {{the growing}} tension, Haynes {{remained}} a member and Betts returned. Their third post-reunion record, Where It All Begins (1994), was recorded entirely live. [...] "The Allman Brothers was a year-by-year thing. There {{was no indication}} that it was capable of staying together for years to <b>come.</b> <b>We</b> all looked at it as each tour could be the last one, {{and there was no}} reason to think otherwise," [...] said Haynes. The band continued to tour with greater frequency, attracting younger generations with their headlining of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could not make it through his acceptance speech. Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. During the 1996 run at the Beacon, turmoil came to a breaking point between Allman and Betts, nearly causing a cancellation of a show and causing another band breakup. [...] "We were upstairs in our dressing rooms [...] I’m sitting there thinking, 'This is it. This is how it finally ends,'" [...] said Trucks. Haynes and Woody left to focus on Gov't Mule, feeling as though a break was imminent with the Allman Brothers Band.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the second}} season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a B+. The review stated that [...] "untangling this web of shifting allegiances and identities requires intense concentration. Hang on, though; the payoff's worth it". Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, noting that it was [...] "X-Files in top form". He praised how the character of Samantha Mulder was presented, saying that [...] "In the seasons to <b>come,</b> <b>we</b> end up with enough Samantha's [...] to fill a clown-car, but here, the reveal is shocking, effective, and unsettling"; and also felt that the episode's flashforward cold open was particularly well-handled. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, wrote that [...] "Colony" [...] presents a moral dilemma for the characters, noting that [...] "on the surface Mulder's quest appears righteous, however, {{the results of his}} quest would suggest otherwise", and adding [...] "generally the ideology that focuses on a single life's (be that human or alien) importance is successful, whereas Mulder's ideology of finding the truth at all costs is not". Duchovny's portrayal of Fox Mulder in this episode has been cited {{as an example of the}} character's reversal of traditional gender roles—his openness and vulnerability when confronted with what he believes is his prodigal sister casts him [...] "in a pattern typically engendered as female." ...|$|E
500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} captured the sounds of crashing, screaming, and the shattering of glass and plates. Three times {{in a period of}} five seconds there were shouts of pain or distress from a hijacker outside the cockpit, suggesting a hijacker that was standing guard outside the cockpit was being attacked by the passengers. Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10:00:03. Five seconds later, he asked, [...] "Is that it? Shall we finish it off?" [...] Another hijacker responded, [...] "No. Not yet. When they all <b>come,</b> <b>we</b> finish it off." [...] Jarrah once again pitched the airplane up and down. A passenger in the background cried, [...] "In the cockpit. If we don't, we'll die" [...] at 10:00:25. Sixteen seconds later, another passenger, identified as Tom Burnett, yelled, [...] "Roll it!", possibly referring to using the food cart. The {{voice recorder}} did record the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door. Jarrah ceased the violent maneuvers at 10:01:00 and recited the takbir several times. He then asked another hijacker, [...] "Is that it? I mean, shall we put it down?" [...] The other hijacker responded, [...] "Yes, put it in it, and pull it down." [...] The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey!", and then [...] "Give it to me!" [...] repeated eight times in succession, possibly referring to the plane's yoke.|$|E

Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much.

2500|$|Until {{the early}} 2010s, Barcelona had {{mounting}} debts, {{built up over}} the past few seasons, a situation that forced the club to push through an emergency bailout loan of €150 million. The Qatar Foundation, run by Sheikha Mozah, becomes the first shirt sponsor in Barcelona’s 111-year history. The club had previously used UNICEF's logo on the front of its shirts. In 2011, incoming Barcelona president Sandro Rosell agreed the deal for a period of five seasons, with the club receiving €30 million each year, starting on 1 July 2011 and running until 30 June 2016, plus bonuses for trophies won that could total €5m. Writing in his El Periodico column, Cruyff slammed the deal, “We are a unique club in the world, no one has kept their jersey intact throughout their history, yet have remained as competitive as they <b>come...</b> <b>We</b> have sold this uniqueness for about six percent of our budget. I understand that we are currently losing more than we are earning. However, by selling the shirt it shows me that we are not being creative, and that we have become vulgar.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "socialism with Chinese characteristics" [...] {{was added}} to the General Program of the party's {{constitution}} at the 12th National Congress, without a definition of the term. At the 13th National Congress, held in 1987, Zhao Ziyang, the CPC General Secretary, claimed that socialism with Chinese characteristics was the [...] "integration of the fundamental tenets of Marxism with the modernization drive in China" [...] and was [...] "scientific socialism rooted in the realities of present-day China". By this time the CPC believed that China was in the primary stage of socialism, and therefore needed market relations to develop into a socialist society. Two years earlier, Su had tried to internationalize the term [...] "primary stage of socialism" [...] by claiming that socialism contained three different production phases. China was currently in the first phase, while the Soviet Union and the remaining Eastern Bloc countries were in the second phase. Because China was in the primary stage of socialism, Zhao argued that in [...] " [...] {{for a long time to}} <b>come,</b> <b>we</b> shall develop various sectors of the economy, always ensuring the dominant position of the public sector". Further, some individuals should be allowed to become rich [...] "before the objective of common prosperity [...] is achieved". Lastly, during the primary stage of socialism, planning would no longer be the primary means of organization of the economy. Upon hearing this remark, Chen Yun, a cautious reformer and the second-most powerful politician in China, walked out of the meeting.|$|E
