5000|$|Steve, [...] "Doc", Charlie, and Dorothy are astronauts {{on a ship}} {{approaching}} Mars. Following {{a scheduled}} cutoff of communications, they encounter and collide with something in orbit around Mars. They are forced to jettison the main stage and land in the control section. They leave in suits, taking with them some essentials, such as inflatable boats and paddles, with a rifle. They paddle down a canal, being attacked by water creatures, and eventually enter a cave system. The cave {{comes to an end}} near a lava flow, and they are forced to leave the boats and edge around a lava lake, eventually finding a passage to the surface, just before the volcano erupts in a Lava fountain. They think they hear the signal of the main stage, but {{it turns out to be}} from an automated biolab, sent to determine the habitability of Mars. Charlie becomes hysterical and shoots the lab, inadvertently revealing that it has enough oxygen left to replenish their dwindling oxygen supplies. A sandstorm blows in and they take shelter in the lee of the lab. The sandstorm uncovers a stone road, which they follow to an abandoned stone city. The city proves to have a breathable atmosphere, which enables them to remove their suits. Exploring, they discover two charred outlines beside a cutting torch near a wall with a partially <b>cut</b> <b>hole</b> and later a column with a hole in it. The column proves to be hollow and a nearby one turns out to conceal a desiccated Martian, with a transparent braincase. Mental communication between it and Steve guides him to a hall, which contains a projection of a head. It reveals that it represents the collective consciousness of all Martians. They were an old race, who once ruled a good part of the galaxy, but who retreated to Mars to ponder. To give themselves time to think, they took their city out of time, in an eternal present. Eventually they discovered that they had a further destiny, but could not reverse the process, being then incapable of physical effort. The city had been previously entered by other beings, who thought to plunder, instead of help. It directs them to a sphere, which must be replaced in the mechanism, in order for time to begin moving forward once again. X drops the sphere, revealing a model of the city. They return to where the others have been cutting a hole in the wall and complete the task. Behind the wall is a giant metal pendulum. Charlie, with help from Steve manages to replace the sphere in the clockwork above the pendulum. The pendulum begins to swing once again. They escape as the city begins to crumble, eventually fading away. They eventually collapse by the stone road and vanish. They reappear in their ship in orbit, dirty and exhausted, where only two minutes have passed.|$|E

Nevertheless, the remarkable scarcity of such exposure {{in the mass media}} speaks to what is perhaps the most significant obstacle to progress in delir-ium research and practice: its invisibility.

40|$|AbstractCurrent fatigue codes only {{consider}} the fatigue performance of drilled and punched holes, limiting {{the use of}} thermal cutting processes to produce bolt holes. This paper studies the fatigue performance of structural steel S 460 M plates containing thermally cut bolt holes. The research covers three thermal cutting methods: the traditional one (oxy-fuel cutting) and two more modern processes (plasma and laser cutting). Specimen geometry is defined by a rectangular cross section with a <b>cut</b> <b>hole</b> in the middle. All the specimens were conducted to failure by applying fatigue cycles, the stress ratio (R) being 0. 1. The corresponding S-N curve and fatigue limit were obtained for each cutting method. Fatigue results have been compared with previous researches on fatigue performance of drilled and punched holes, and with the predictions provided by current fatigue standards, analyzing the possibility to extrapolate their S-N curves, focused on drilled and punched holes, to thermally cut holes...|$|E

40|$|All textile {{industries}} aim {{to produce}} competitive textiles. The competition enhancement depends mainly on productivity {{and quality of}} the textiles produced by each industry. Especially in the least developed countries like Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh where textile {{is one of the main}} incomes of economy, still using manual quality control techniques to identify defects in their textile products. Therefore this study carries out to classify defects in textiles with minimum intervention of human being using artificial neural network technology and some principles of image processing techniques. My approach is to identify defects in textile comprises three steps, namely, image processing, image classification and producing the output as a classification chart. I have used the standard techniques of image processing; while the image classification is handled by an ANN trained in the supervised mode with the aid of back propagation training algorithm. I have selected three major defect types of defects from textile quality process. They are <b>cut</b> <b>hole</b> damages, open seam of the garment and pen marks. Input data is a 185220 x 30 matrix and it is representing 30 samples of 185220 elements. The output of the system will be an image file with a defect classification chart. In fact, basically this system is able to classify defects in to three categories. This system mainly is divided in to three sections namely; image processing module, neural network module and output generator module. But the system design is separated in to two parts. The first part of the research processes the images to fit for the input layer of the neural network. The second part uses the input set to classify the defects and adapts the neural net. The prototype develop in this project have been trained to identify <b>cut</b> <b>hole</b> damages, open seam and pen mark of the garments by considering 300 images. A concatenate image, which contained 300 samples of each defect type, was trained and tested. The accuracy rate of recognizing the numbers and symbols were 77 %. However this accuracy rate is very high. Using the neural network technology and back propagation learning algorithm, to classify textile defects were successful even there was a high probability to misclassify different types of defect images with different range of severity rates...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of the cutting method on both the fatigue crack initiation and the fatigue life of steel S 355 M. The research covers three cutting methods (plasma, laser and oxy-fuel) and two specimen geometries: plain specimens with rectangular section and cut edges, and specimens with machined edges and a <b>cut</b> <b>hole</b> in the middle section. All the specimens were conducted to failure in a resonance machine by applying fatigue cycles, the stress ratio (R) being 0. 1, and the corresponding S-N curves were obtained for each combination of cutting method and specimen geometry. The crack initiation time was estimated by analyzing the evolution of the resonance frequency on each specimen. The results show a significant influence of the cutting method on both the crack initiation and the fatigue life of this particular steel.

30|$|The Daliuta {{coal mine}} {{is a large}} modern mine in the Shenhua coal group, with {{approved}} production capacity of 21, 700, 000  tons. The Shenhua coal group {{is located in the}} northern part of Shaanxi Province and composed of the Daliuta and Huojitu coal mines. Daliuta has mine area of 189.9  km 2, coal reserves of 2.32 billion tons, and recoverable reserves of 1.53 billion tons. The roof of the 5 – 2 coal seam is composed of sandstone with an average thickness of 30.87  m. In order to prevent the roof failure due to weighting over great extent, pre splitting blasting for the thick sandstone in the open <b>cut</b> <b>hole</b> was carried out. However, the initial pressure occurs until the panel advances to the 95  m. Such a large area of the roof once falling will cause great harm. This is a serious threat to the safety and efficiency of production on the working face. Therefore, it is urgent to find out the internal cause of roof failure due to weighting over great extent, so that the corresponding control measures can be put forward. According to the formation of this kind of mine pressure, the rock mechanical properties of the overlying strata are the major influential factors. Moreover, acoustic emission monitoring can monitor and predict this kind of dynamic disaster. Therefore, it has engineering and theoretical significance to study the mechanics and acoustic emission characteristics of the rock.|$|E
