It was seen close to Mende, once at Pailhou and between Rieutort-de-Randon and Chastel-Nouvel but remained primarily in Margeride. At this time the quarrel between the consul and the bishop was brought up to date by the edict on municipal organizations. The burghers and nobles opposed, but the bishop finally retained power in 1771.|$|E
500|$|On 14 September 2014 (which {{would have}} been Winehouse's 31st birthday), a statue was {{unveiled}} of her, which was created by sculptor Scott Eaton, at Stables Market in Camden Town, north London. Fans and relatives gathered for the unveiling in Camden's Stable Market, {{where it will be}} a permanent memorial to her. London-based Eaton, who sculpted the piece after being introduced to Winehouse's father Mitch, said the statue was meant to capture her [...] "attitude and strength, but also give subtle hints of insecurity." [...] Her father Mitch said of the statue: [...] "Now Amy will oversee the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> <b>of</b> her home town forever... Amy was in love with Camden and it is the place her fans {{from all over the world}} associate her with." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{traditional}} Ainsworth et al. (1978) coding of the Strange Situation, secure infants are denoted as [...] "Group B" [...] infants {{and they are}} further subclassified as B1, B2, B3, and B4. Although these subgroupings refer to different stylistic responses to the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> <b>of</b> the caregiver, they were not given specific labels by Ainsworth and colleagues, although their descriptive behaviors led others (including students of Ainsworth) to devise a relatively 'loose' terminology for these subgroups. B1's have {{been referred to as}} 'secure-reserved', B2's as 'secure-inhibited', B3's as 'secure-balanced', and B4's as 'secure-reactive'. In academic publications however, the classification of infants (if subgroups are denoted) is typically simply [...] "B1" [...] or [...] "B2" [...] although more theoretical and review-oriented papers surrounding attachment theory may use the above terminology.|$|E

500|$|The site of Köllnischer Park {{was just}} outside Cölln in the Middle Ages. Until the mid-17th century, it was undeveloped low-lying, swampy land prone to {{flooding}} by the Spree. Following the decision by Frederick William, the 'Great Elector' to encircle Berlin with fortifications, this became the location of Bastion VII, which was known {{at the time as}} [...] "the bulwerk in the morass'. The work required the creation of large embankments and lasted until 1683; the swampland around the bastion was not fully drained until 1687. After such lengthy construction, the works were already out of date militarily, and after 1700 served only to control the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> <b>of</b> visitors and residents, prevent desertion, and enable the collection of tolls on those entering the city. By 1700, Mulberry trees had been planted on the walls, but only 'persons of rank' were permitted to promenade along them. After Berlin had grown considerably and the Customs Wall had been built around it, King Frederick William I (16881740) ordered the defensive walls to be demolished. Civilian buildings had already grown up on the bastions; a windmill and a house for the miller were built on Bastion VII, and these caused the eastern portion to be left standing longer than other parts of the fortifications. Some of the rubble from the demolished fortifications was used to build up Wilhelmstraße; the rest was thrown into the defensive ditch outside the walls.|$|E
2500|$|The routine {{nature of}} her {{schedule}} did nothing to diminish public interest in the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> <b>of</b> Empress of Russia. For example, the New York Times regularly published news of mail ships sailings.

2500|$|Butler later {{recorded}} {{that during}} his period as acting Head of Government at Number Ten, he noticed constant <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> <b>of</b> ministers to Macmillan's study in Number 11 next door – {{and that those}} who attended all seemed to receive promotions when Macmillan became Prime Minister. Macmillan had opposed Eden's trip to Jamaica and told Butler (15 December, the day after Eden's return) that younger members of the Cabinet wanted Eden out. Macmillan argued at Cabinet on 4 January that Suez {{should be regarded as}} a [...] "strategic retreat" [...] like Mons or Dunkirk. This did not meet with Eden's approval at Cabinet on 7 January.|$|E

2500|$|After World War I, Henry Ford began {{a program}} of decentralizing his {{manufacturing}} efforts away from Detroit and Dearborn, Michigan, establishing plants {{in other areas of}} Michigan and across the country. [...] Ford felt that decentralization held many advantages, in particular that managing the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> <b>of</b> a large number of employees at any one site became problematic. [...] One part of this plan was the establishment of small rural manufacturing plants knows as [...] "village industries." [...] The village industries reflected Ford's vision of decentralization: not merely locating factories in different cities or regions of the country, but taking specific production tasks out of the larger factories and moving them to small rural factories.|$|E

2500|$|Hội An, {{located a}} short {{distance}} from Da Nang, was the largest port in early modern Vietnam. The Japanese community there was quite small, consisting of only a few tens of households, in contrast both to the Japanese community of other cities such as Ayutthaya, and to the Chinese population of Hội An, which numbered in the thousands. Even so, the Japanese in the Nihonmachi of Hội An exerted a powerful influence upon the affairs of the trading port, the Japanese demand for silk being so great that the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> <b>of</b> Japanese merchant ships every year caused dramatic cyclical shifts in market prices. On average, more than ten Japanese ships visited the port every year during the period of the [...] "red seal ships", that is, between roughly 1590 and 1635; this represented fully a quarter of all Japanese maritime economic activity, more than that of any other individual port.|$|E
