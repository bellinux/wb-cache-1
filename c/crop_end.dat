40|$|In 1994, LINTUL-POTATO was published, a {{comprehensive}} model of potato development and growth. The mechanistic model simulated early crop processes (emergence and leaf expansion) and light interception until extinction, through leaf layers. Photosynthesis and respiration {{in a previous}} crop growth model—SUCROS— were substituted by a temperature-dependent light use efficiency. Leaf senescence at initial crop stages was simulated by allowing a longevity per daily leaf class formed, and crop senescence started when all daily dry matter production was allocated to the tubers, leaving none for the foliage. The model performed well in, e. g., ideotyping studies. For other studies such as benchmarking production environments, agroecological zoning, climatic hazards, climate change, and yield gap analysis, the need was felt to develop from the original LINTUL-POTATO, a derivative LINTULPOTATO- DSS with fewer equations—reducing the potential sources of error in calculations— and fewer parameters. This reduces the number of input parameters {{as well as the}} amount of data required that for many reasons are not available or not reliable. In LINTUL-POTATO-DSS calculating potential yields, initial crop development depends on a fixed temperature sum for ground cover development from 0 % at emergence to 100 %. Light use efficiency is temperature dependent. Dry matter distribution to the tubers starts at tuber initiation and linearly increases up to a fixed harvest index which is reached at <b>crop</b> <b>end.</b> <b>Crop</b> <b>end</b> is input of the model: it is assumed that the crop cycle determined by maturity matches the length of the available frost-free and or heat-free cropping season. LINTUL-POTATO-DSS includes novel calculations to explore tuber quality characteristics such as tuber size distribution and dry matter concentration depending on crop environment and management.

40|$|Industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa) was {{successfully}} grown {{over a three-year}} period without the use of agrochemicals, and with a relatively low input of nitrogen fertilizer at 120 kg/ha (96 units/ac). The yields achieved were encouraging at an average of 12. 5 t/ha of whole stems at 15 % m. c. over the three years. Sowing in early- to mid-April at a seed rate of half the conventional recommended rate of 50 kg/ha proved to be sufficient to achieve the maximum yield of stems where long fibre yield and finess (quality) are not required. For this study the hemp was produced as a raw material for the fibre board industry, where the whole stem and not just the long blast fibre is required. Hemp is relatively disease-free with Botrytis and Sclerotinia the only diseases encountered. For both, spraying is not possible due to the height of the crop. Infection rarely causes economic losses. Harvesting hemp proved difficult with conventional farm harvesting equipment. The development of the hemp crop as an industrial raw material will require the development of harvesting, chopping and storage techniques that can cope with the height, bulk and fibrous nature of the <b>crop.</b> <b>End</b> of Project Repor...|$|E

40|$|Soya - a {{rich source}} of protein, oil and income Cue: Soya beans are best known for being rich in two {{important}} foodstuffs: oil and protein. Much of the world?s cooking oil is derived from soya, and most of this is grown in the United States, Brazil, China and Argentina. Soya beans, also called soybeans, are widely eaten as a vegetable in East Asia, where the plant originates from, but less so {{in other parts of the}} world. One reason may be that the beans need a long period of soaking and cooking to make them edible. However, because of its high protein content, soya is an excellent food, particularly for those who cannot eat meat - whether for reasons of cost or because they are vegetarian. In Malawi, soya beans are used as an ingredient in phala, a nutritious porridge widely fed to babies. Mrs Linley Banda grows soya on her farm in Thyolo district, in southern Malawi. Patrick Mphaka went to visit her there, to find out more about this nutritious food and cash crop. IN:		?Yes it is easy to grow soya beans? OUT:		? I have benefited from the crop. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mrs Linley Banda from Thyolo in Malawi was talking to Patrick Mphaka. Transcript Banda	Yes it is easy to grow soya beans compared to other cash crops. But it also has its own problems. The advantage of growing soya crops is that it does not require too many inputs compared to maize. The problems are that it is attacked by some pests and diseases and sometimes it is destroyed when the rains are prolonged. Mphaka	So you do not need a lot of rains for soya beans? Banda	The rains are required but not too much. Mphaka	On the two hectares on which you have planted your soya beans this year, how many bags do you think you will realise from there? Banda	As you have seen, this year we did not have enough rains. I am sure I will get about sixty bags of soya from this garden because last year I had about ninety 50 kg bags of soya. Mphaka	Can we talk about money, how much is that? Banda	(Laughter) I am sure you are good at maths, you can calculate. Mphaka	Do you just harvest it and take it to the market or just harvest it and have people come and buy? How do you do it with soya beans? Banda	After harvesting the soya beans, we thresh it and winnow it. And thereafter, we check if there are some stones and some immature seed. After that we pack it in bags and it is ready for sale. Mphaka	Do you put it in different grades or do you just sell it as one grade? Banda	It is good to put it in grades so that you can fetch good price. I put in grades. Mphaka	Tell me about the market. Banda	There is a very good established market for soya. There is Rab Processors which is buying soya from us farmers. Transglobe is also buying soya from us. Other NGOs do fetch some seeds from us to give to other farmers so that they can start growing this crop. Mphaka	So why do you sell it to the local market? Banda	I sell to the local market because some farmers just come to my house to buy for their house use. So I cannot refuse to sell to them. Mphaka	What do you think is the reason that not many farmers around here are growing soya beans, when given your experience, it is a very profitable crop? Banda	The problem is that many farmers do not realize the importance of soya beans and the way to process and utilize it. They feel it is difficult to grow the soya beans. Mphaka	Do you think people are used to eating soya or maybe they think that it is something which they do not know about as evidenced by their not growing it in large numbers? Banda	As of now, I can say people are now learning the goodness of eating soya. Many farmers around this area are now coming to buy the crop for their house use. Through the radio and hospitals where the under-five children are going for scales, they are told to feed their children phala (porridge) with soya. Mphaka	Given the two years that you have been growing it, are there any people who are showing interest to start to grow soya beans? Banda	Yes there are so many that this year, around this area more farmers have now started planting this crop because they have seen what I have benefited from the <b>crop.</b> <b>End</b> of track. Linley Banda grows soya beans on her farm in southern Malawi. She likes the crop because it needs less inputs than maize. She sells most of her soya beans to food processors...|$|E
