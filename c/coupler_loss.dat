30|$|This {{equation}} gives {{boundary condition}} to achieve delay time pulse for the single-ring resonator. By solving this equation, {{the rate of}} radius for each waveguide can be calculated. Here, input power, <b>coupler</b> <b>loss</b> and coupler coefficient are fixed parameters based on experimental and theoretical previous work and research. Therefore, if the input power, coupler coefficient and core area are considered as fixed parameters, the regime of radius of ring can be calculated. Equation (6) depends on coupler coefficient, loss waveguide and internal phase which depends on input power, linear refractive and nonlinear refractive index. Equation (8) shows the relation between internal phase and input power.|$|E
30|$|Relative phase {{shifts of}} through and drop ports for {{different}} coupling coefficients and coupling losses are demonstrated in Figs.  3 c, 4 c and 5 c. Results show that relative phase shift in critical coupling condition is independent from optical parameters of couplers (coupling coefficients and coupling loss). The relative phase shifts of the through and drop ports {{can be considered}} as a new evaluating factor for checking the system on critical coupling condition. When an ADR system is in a critical coupling condition, the through and drop ports will have the butterfly-like relative phase shift as shown in parts c of Figs.  3, 4 and 5. The through gain shows the fraction of electric fields at the through port to the input port, while the drop gain is given by Edrop/Ein. The effect of critical coupling variations in the response of the through port gain versus drop port gain is shown in Figs.  3 d, 4 d and 5 d. Based on the simulated results, the behavior of gains at the drop and through ports remains the same for lossless coupling. It seems that the coupling coefficient is not a determinative factor in the output gains of ADR. Change in coupling losses and coupling coefficients is quite effective in the through port gain. As shown in Figs.  3 e, 4 e and 5 e, increasing the <b>coupler</b> <b>loss</b> can decrease the through port gain. This treat can be observed in intensity response on through port versus drop port, too. The transmission characteristics of light via through and drop ports of ADR are totally dependent on the critical condition parameters, especially coupler’s parameters. As shown in Fig.  3 f, the 50  dB transmission at the through port of ADR corresponds to the 42  dB transmission at the drop port for k 1 [*]=[*] 0.1, k 2 [*]=[*] 0.1 with lossless coupling. An increase in <b>coupler</b> <b>loss</b> will reduce the drop port transmission to a value less than 25  dB. In this case, the through port transmission holds its 50  dB value. Changing the coupling coefficient to k 1 [*]=[*] 0.05; k 2 [*]=[*] 0.05 with γ = 0 will change the through and drop ports transmissions to 45 and 39  dB, respectively. Here, increment of <b>coupler</b> <b>loss</b> solely effects on the drop port transmission.|$|E

This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the sensitivity of the FRR which is made of an air-core photonic-bandgap fiber (PBF), in which the characteristics of the FRR using PBF are compared with that of an FRR using a conventional single mode fiber. When using PBF instead of conventional fiber, it is found that the resonance curve is changed, and the sensitivity of the FRR is decreased a little when a narrow spectral linewidth laser is used. However, the degree of the decrease in sensitivity is not big enough to deny the advantages of PBF in improving the performance of the R-FOG considering that PBF is much better than conventional fiber in reducing the drift. Also, the optimal parameters of the directional coupler for sensitivity are discussed.

An analytical method resorting {{to the energy}} E of an oscillator with perturbed nonlinear potential is proposed and demonstrated for investigating the bifurcation and the near-separatrix-crossing of a nonlinear fiber <b>coupler</b> with <b>loss</b> and saturable nonlinearity. Two characteristic equations for bifurcation and near-separatrix-cros sing are obtained, from which the critical optical power, the minimum coupling length and the maximum coupler length can be decided. These two equations {{can be used as}} the design criteria of a nonlinear fiber <b>coupler</b> with <b>loss</b> and saturable nonlinearity. The techniques of fabrication and measurement of twin-core rare-earth doped nonlinear fibers are described. The nonlinear refractive index coefficients in erbium or neodymium doped fibers are determined using two core fibers in which only one core is doped. The nonlinearity caused by population redistribution in rare-earth doped fibers is wavelength-dependent. Moreover, the nonlinear saturation effect is observed. The all-optical fiber switch constructed from a twin-core erbium-doped fiber is studied theoretically and experimentally. The switching behaviour is simulated theoretically, and a switching fraction of 65 % is obtained experimentally. The advantage of this switch is that it requires only a fraction of a milliwatt of input power to switch. The transient switching experiment indicates that the switching response time is in the order of 10 ms. Furthermore, a compact optical switching device {{through the use of a}} twin-core Nd 3 +-doped fiber coupler and a laser diode is demonstrated. Steady state switching and transient switching is obtained. The switching power is 5. 6 mW and the switching speed is 500 p. s which is 20 times faster than that in twin-core Er^-doped fiber couplers. In addition to the passive fiber devices, an active twin-core rare-earth doped fiber coupler is proposed and studied theoretically. It is demonstrated both numerically and experimentally that a narrow-band wavelength filter/demultiplexer with gain can be constructed from a twin-core rare-earth-doped fiber. The experimental bandwidth obtained is 6. 5 nm. In addition, the filtered signal experiences a gain of 20 dB instead of attenuation. A preliminary study of using light to control light has been carried out. Optical signal switching through the use of a pump light is observed. Finally, a theoretical model has been proposed in that a twin-core erbium-doped fiber can be used as an optical fiber amplifier. Its gain spectrum is flat within 2. 5 dB in a bandwidth of 30 nm. This gain spectrum can be adjusted continuously by varying the pump power launched into one of the cores...|$|R

30|$|The Stanford {{architecture}} [4, 32] proposes {{measuring the}} transmitted RF signal (e.g., {{with a low}} insertion <b>loss</b> <b>coupler)</b> immediately before it {{is applied to the}} antenna.

A practical implementation of this approach using tapped delay lines achieved 45 dB active suppression, over a 40 MHz bandwidth at 2.45 GHz [4]. An advantage of the Stanford architecture is that hardware imperfections introduced by the transmitter circuit are inherently included in the cancellation signal. However, system-specific RF cancellation circuits are required to model the effect of the channel and the architecture does not scale well to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, as each transmitter-receiver pair requires a dedicated circuit [32].|$|R

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{applications}} for radar systems in automobiles demands for low-cost radar front-ends. A planar monostatic radar front-end is particularly suited for low cost applications as it uses only one antenna for transmission and reception and, thus, minimizes the needed chip area. Generally, in a standard homodyne radar a radio-frequency (RF) signal generated by an oscillator is used for both, the transmitted signal and the local oscillator (LO). Well controlled distribution of the input power between antenna and mixer is crucial. A transceiving mixer at 76. 5 GHz is presented, where this distribution is done by use of a rat-race coupler. In a conventional transceiver the oscillator signal is split into the transmitted and in the LO signal by a directional coupler. A second directional coupler is {{needed in order to}} merge the received and the LO signal at the mixer. In our design the purpose of splitting and merging the signals is realized with only one coupler. Elimination of the second <b>coupler</b> reduces <b>losses</b> significantly. The received signal is down-converted to the intermediate frequency (IF) by use of a balanced mixer. For small relative speed in a CW-Doppler-radar or short distance in a FMCWradar the IF is very small. Therefore 1 /f noise is a significant value. In order to achieve good 1 /f noise characteristics, Schottky diodes were used. The diodes were flip-chip bonded onto a microstrip circuit on a Al 2 O 3 substrate.

We also confirmed that upward-moving and moderate-elongation of the ferrite core in the power coupler is effective to reduce the wasted loss. In order to verify the result, we evaluated the lamp efficiency of a lamp with a modified power coupler. Resultantly, the lamp efficiency was increased by approximately 3 lm/W (lumen per Watt).

Structure of Gd 2 O 3 films annealed at different temperature ranging from 400 to 750 8 C were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that Gd 2 O 3 starts crystallizing at about 400 8 C and the crystallite size increases with annealing temperature. Oriented growth of (4 0 0) face of Gd 2 O 3 has been observed when the films were deposited on (1 0 0) Si substrate and annealed at 750 8 C. The laser beam (l 632 : 8 nm) was coupled into the film by a prism <b>coupler</b> and propagation <b>loss</b> of the film measured by scattering-detection method is about 2 dB/cm. Luminescence properties of europium ions doped films were measured and are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{plasmonic}} devices {{have become an}} interesting area of research due to the sub-wavelength confinement and propagation of radiation, allowing the design of very compact structures. Compact structures are necessary to make smaller integrated optical circuits. Due {{to the use of}} metals, plasmonic guides usually show more losses compared to the conventional dielectric guides. Therefore, plasmonic waveguides are not normally used for long distance transmission. However, they are promising for inter-chip or intra-chip communication and also have seen a lot of sensor applications. There has been considerable interest in exploiting the frequency bands in the terahertz regime to open up new frontiers of research across a diverse range of applications. An array of opportunities for creating novel technologies using this frequency band had remained largely unexplored and undeveloped for a considerable period of time {{due to the lack of}} suitable sources, as well as lack of guiding and detecting devices. This thesis describes the design, analysis and optimisation of plasmonic devices in optical and terahertz frequencies. A fully vectorial H-field based finite element method has been used in the research reported in this thesis to reveal the modal characteristics of different plasmonic structures. A six layer planar contra-directional nano-coupler has been analysed at optical frequency. Three different modes of propagation were considered to study the characteristics of different properties of the structure, including the coupling length. A design approach has been proposed to make the <b>coupler</b> low <b>loss</b> as well as smaller in length. For the terahertz plasmonics, a rectangular metallic hollow core guide was considered at terahertz frequency. Several modes were considered for the modal analysis of the structure. Modal analysis was performed by changing metal, introducing different dielectric coating in the hollow core, changing the thickness of the metal and dielectric layers and changing the dimensions of the guide. A dispersion analysis was also performed. The criteria for designing very low loss, compact and low dispersion guide have been presented for the structure at the end of the study...|$|R
40|$|We review our {{advances}} in diffractive and subwavelength grating coupler structures for microphotonic waveguides. We present a subwavelength grating fiber-chip edge <b>coupler</b> with a <b>loss</b> {{as low as}} 0. 9 dB and with minimal wavelength dependence over a broad wavelength range exceeding 200 nm. We also present fiber-to-chip surface grating couplers based on subwavelength effective medium. The effective medium refractive index is engineered to control {{the strength of the}} grating and thereby maximize coupling efficiency, while mitigating back reflections at the same time. We analyze the fabrication tolerances of the coupler, which are of particular relevance for large scale photonic fabrication. Furthermore, we present the first grating coupler for micrometric silicon rib waveguides, which is particularly challenging since the coupler waveguide region is multimode. We experimentally demonstrate grating couplers in 1. 5 3 ̆bcm thick silicon ridge waveguides with a coupling efficiency of 2. 2 dB and a 3 dB bandwidth of 40 nm. An inverse taper is used to match the fundamental mode of the interconnection waveguide with the optimum grating coupler excitation field, with negligible higher order mode excitation. The coupler was fabricated using i-line stepper lithography and single etch step. 9 2012 IEEE. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
