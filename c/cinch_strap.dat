50|$|In November 1909, Foulois {{became the}} only officer {{detailed}} to the Aeronautical Division. He accrued three hours and two minutes total flying time at College Park but did not solo. Because of inclement winter weather at College Park, Foulois was assigned to move the flying program to Fort Sam Houston, an Army post near San Antonio, Texas. Foulois and eight enlisted men disassembled the still-damaged S.C. No. 1, shipped it to Texas in 17 crates, and reassembled it on February 23, 1910, after building a shed to house it on the Arthur MacArthur Field used for cavalry drill. On 2 March 1910, after training himself, Foulois logged his first solo from 9:30am to 9:37am and four flights in total, crashing the S.C. No. 1 on its final landing. He achieved a maximum altitude of 200 ft and a speed of 50 mph in logging 59 minutes and 30 seconds of flight time. He flew the repaired craft five times on March 12, and received written instruction by mail from the Wright Brothers. Until 1911, Foulois remained as the Army's sole aviator and innovator. He stated in annotating the aircraft's flight log that he installed a 4 ft leather <b>cinch</b> <b>strap</b> from the Cavalry saddlery as a safety belt on the S.C. No. 1 on March 12, 1910, then on August 8 he and Oliver Simmons bolted wheels from a cultivator onto the landing skids to provide the first landing gear. S.C. No. 1 made its last flight, and the 66th on it by Foulois, on February 8, 1911.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first section}} {{provided}} that roping any unbroken horse or untrained bull was illegal. This {{was followed by}} prohibitions on [...] "wrestling, fighting, or struggling with any untrained bull", and on stimulating a horse or bull to buck. This last provision would exclude <b>cinch</b> <b>straps</b> specifically designed to irritate the animal or a <b>strap</b> <b>cinched</b> around its genitals. The prohibitions applied {{not only to the}} riders and the stock contractors preparing the animals, but to any promoter of the contests or exhibitions.|$|R
5000|$|He {{even took}} his rodeo {{to the newly}} opened Wembley Stadium in London, in 1924. Austin took to Britain such rodeo stars as: Ike Rude, Manerd Gayler, Andy Lund, Art Lund, Dave Campbell and Rube Roberts. [...] The rodeo was {{challenged}} by animal rights activists attempting to get a court order barring the rodeo {{on the basis of}} animal cruelty. [...] The Wembly rodeo, in which Austin lost $20,000, was to cause Parliament to pass the Protection of Animals Act 1934 which made it an offense to rope an untrained animal or to ride one using a cruel appliance such as a <b>strap</b> <b>cinched</b> tight around its genitals.|$|R
