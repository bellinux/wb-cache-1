5|$|The matchup of <b>closers,</b> Mariano Rivera and Brad Lidge, {{also drew}} attention. Rivera and Lidge {{were the only}} <b>closers</b> who had not blown a save during the 2009 postseason, whereas <b>closers</b> on other postseason teams blew 11 saves in the 24 postseason games before the World Series in 2009. Both had {{performed}} well during the postseason, but Lidge had posted a 7.21 ERA during the 2009 regular season, in contrast to Rivera's 1.76. Lidge's 2009 numbers were {{in stark contrast to}} the previous season (41 out of 41 save opportunities, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts in 62 games). As a result, USA Today gave the Yankees the edge, noting that Lidge had blown two saves against the Yankees during their regular season series earlier that year.|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{statistics}} for the 1980s gave him a valid claim as the best reliever of the decade, although he was rivaled by Jeff Reardon. While Smith had four consecutive 30-save seasons, Reardon finished the decade with five consecutive. Smith saved 234 games {{by the end of}} 1989, and Reardon had 266. Reardon was {{also a member of the}} 1987 World Series-winning Minnesota Twins. On December 6, , the Red Sox had both <b>closers</b> on their roster when they signed Reardon as a free agent. Two of the past decade's most dominating <b>closers</b> in history were even pitching in games together for Boston for the first month of 1990 with Reardon setting up Smith for a save on April 18—a game started by a third famous pitcher, Roger Clemens. The unusual double-closer situation lasted less than a month before Smith was traded to St. Louis for slugging outfielder Tom Brunansky on May 4, 1990.|$|E

The awards are named after Mariano Rivera and Trevor Hoffman, who played their entire {{careers in the}} respective leagues. First issued in 2014, the awards replaced the Major League Baseball Delivery Man of the Year Award, which had been presented since 2005. Also in 2014, the Major League Baseball Delivery Man of the Month Award was discontinued. Though all relief pitchers are eligible, all recipients of the award have been <b>closers.</b>|$|E
5|$|From 2004 to 2009, Nathan was {{considered}} one of the top <b>closers</b> in Major League Baseball (MLB) with four All-Star appearances and a league-leading 246 saves. In 2010, Nathan underwent Tommy John surgery to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his throwing elbow and missed the entire season. On April 3, 2011, Nathan recorded his first save since his injury against the Toronto Blue Jays and later that year in July, Nathan regained the role as closer. On August 10, 2011, he became the Twins all-time leader in saves with his 255th in a game against the Boston Red Sox. After the 2011 season, Nathan left the Twins via free agency to sign with the Texas Rangers, becoming an All-Star again in 2012 and 2013. On April 8, 2013, he earned his 300th save. After the 2013 season, Nathan left the Rangers via free agency to sign with the Detroit Tigers. Nathan is currently eighth on the all-time saves list.|$|E
5|$|The American League's <b>closers</b> then {{entered the}} game, with Jonathan Papelbon {{pitching}} a scoreless {{bottom of the}} eighth. In the ninth, J.J. Putz tried to earn the save and began by inducing a weak pop-up and striking out Brian McCann. Pinch-hitter Dmitri Young rolled a ground ball deep in the hole to Brian Roberts, {{but he could not}} come up with it. Alfonso Soriano followed with a two-run home run to right field to cut the NL's deficit to one. After Putz walked J. J. Hardy, AL manager Jim Leyland replaced him with Francisco Rodríguez. However, Rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his pitches and walked Derrek Lee on a check-swing 3–2 pitch and then Orlando Hudson to load the bases. In a move that drew criticism, La Russa elected not to pinch-hit his last player on the bench, Albert Pujols, and instead let Aaron Rowand hit. Rowand lofted a fly ball to right field that was caught by Alex Ríos to close the game, earning the American League their tenth consecutive victory.|$|E

5|$|After {{spending}} {{two weeks}} {{on the disabled list}} with a groin strain during the opening month of the 1998 season, Rivera continued to establish himself as one of the major leagues' best <b>closers.</b> Moreover, he became the central figure of a Yankees bullpen that, supported by middle relievers Jeff Nelson and Mike Stanton, contributed to the team's late-1990s dynasty. That year, Rivera made the cutter one of his primary pitches, and it quickly became his signature, earning a reputation for breaking hitters' bats with its sharp lateral movement. He saved 36games in 41opportunities and had a 1.91ERA in the regular season. In the 1998 postseason, he pitched scoreless innings and saved six games, three of which came in the 1998 World Series against the San Diego Padres. Rivera's save in Game 4 of the series clinched the Yankees' championship, capping off a season in which they won an MLB-record 125games combined in the regular season and the postseason. By season's end, Rivera had allowed only two earned runs in 35 career postseason innings pitched—a 0.51ERA—and by passing 30innings pitched, he qualified for the major league record for lowest postseason career ERA; it is a record he still holds after 141innings pitched.|$|E

25|$|This bond {{is exactly}} like English cross bond {{except in the}} {{generating}} of the lap at the quoins. In Dutch bond, all quoins are three-quarter bats—placed in alternately stretching and heading orientation with successive courses—and no use whatever is made of queen <b>closers.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{great variety}} of monk bond {{patterns}} allow for many possible layouts at the quoins, and many possible arrangements for generating a lap. A quoin brick may be a stretcher, a three-quarter bat, or a header. Queen <b>closers</b> may be used next to the quoins, but the practice is not mandatory.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, Puerto Rico's {{economy grew}} significantly, and this {{encouraged}} baseball-related gambling. This tendency experienced a notable {{increase in the}} early 1960s. Other changes arried in the game's style, {{with the introduction of}} more player-managers such as Luis Olmo, who became the first to consistently employ pitching coaches and <b>closers</b> in the league.|$|E
25|$|This bond has {{alternating}} {{stretching and}} heading courses, with the headers centred over {{the midpoint of}} the stretchers, and perpends in each alternate course aligned. Queen <b>closers</b> appear as the second brick, and the penultimate brick in heading courses. A muted colour scheme for occasional headers is sometimes used in English bond to lend a subtle texture to the brickwork. Examples of such schemes include blue-grey headers among otherwise red bricks—seen in the south of England—and light brown headers in a dark brown wall, more often found in parts of the north of England.|$|E

25|$|Another {{major change}} {{that had been}} {{occurring}} during this time was {{the adoption of the}} pitch count. Starting pitchers playing complete games had not been an unusual thing in baseball's history. Now pitching coaches watched to see how many pitches a player had thrown over the game. At anywhere from 100 to 125, pitchers increasingly would be pulled out to preserve their arms. Bullpens began to specialize more, with more pitchers being trained as middle relievers, and a few hurlers, usually possessing high velocity but not much durability, as <b>closers.</b>|$|E
25|$|McGraw {{emerged as}} one of the top <b>closers</b> in the National League in the early 1970s, enjoying a career year in 1972. He was 3–3 with a 2.01 ERA and fifteen saves at the All-Star break to earn his first All-Star selection. McGraw pitched two innings, {{striking}} out four and giving up only one hit to earn the win in the NL's 4–3 come from behind victory. For the season, McGraw went 8–6 with a 1.70 ERA, giving up just 71 hits in 106 innings pitched, and setting a Mets record with 27 saves that lasted until 1984.|$|E
25|$|After {{veraison}} has begun, viticulturists {{will test}} several hundred individual berries picked from clusters throughout the vineyard in increasing intervals as the harvest draws <b>closers.</b> The berries will usually {{be taken from}} the middle of the cluster bunch, avoiding vines on the end of rows that tend to be exposed to the most unusual elements. The must weight is then plotted on a chart to see the increasing ripeness and sugar levels of the grape. What must weight reading is most desirable will depend on the winemaker's personal goal for ripeness. A wine with the intended potential alcohol level of 12% will need to be harvested at around 21.7°Bx/12 degree Baumé/93°Oe. A wine with the intended potential alcohol level of 15% will need to be harvested at around 27.1°Bx/15 degree Baumé/119°Oe. The desired ripeness for most table wines tend to fall somewhere between those two must weight measurements.|$|E

The band spent $100,000 on a New York City Times Square billboard to advertise <b>Closer</b> to Home. By 1971, Grand Funk equalled the Beatles' Shea Stadium attendance record, but sold out the venue in just 72 hours whereas the Beatles concert took a few weeks to sell out. Following <b>Closer</b> to Home, Live Album was also released in 1970, and was another gold disc recipient. Survival and E Pluribus Funk were both released in 1971.
