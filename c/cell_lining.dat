Heterotopic means the displacement of an organ from its normal anatomic location. Inflammation of this Meckel's diverticulum may mimic appendicitis. Therefore, during appendectomy, ileum should be checked for the presence of Meckel's diverticulum, if it is found to be present it should be removed along with appendix.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: <b>Cell</b> <b>lines</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in biomedical research, but the nomenclature describing <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> {{has not been}} standardized. The problems are both linguistic and experimental. Many ambiguous <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> names appear in the published literature. Users of the same <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> may refer to it in different ways, and <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> may mutate or become contaminated without {{the knowledge of the}} user. As a first step towards rationalizing this nomenclature, we created a <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> knowledgebase (CLKB) with a well-structured collection of names and descriptive data for <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> cultured in vitro. The objectives of this work are: (i) to assist users in extracting useful information from biomedical text and (ii) to highlight the importance of standardizing <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> names in biomedical research. This CLKB contains a broad collection of <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> names compiled from ATCC, Hyper CLDB and MeSH. In addition to names, the knowledgebase specifies relationships between <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> We analyze the use of <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> names in biomedical text. Issues include ambiguous names, polymorphisms in the use of names and the fact that some <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> names are also common English words. Linguistic patterns associated with the occurrence of <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> names are analyzed. Applying these patterns to find additional <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> names in the literature identifies {{only a small number of}} additional names.

50|$|Fluid {{mechanics}} {{are primarily}} affected by pressure, temperature, heat transfer, and electrokinetics. An {{increase in pressure}} increases the flow rate given by the Starling equation. An increase in temperature increases the wettability of the surface, promoting fluid flow. Heat also decreases the viscosity of the lumen. Heat transfer is monitored by thermoreceptors which regulate the amount of capillary beds open for heat dissipation. The surface chemistry of the endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>lining</b> also dictates fluid flow. A charged surface will acquire a layer of stagnant diffuse ions that hinder the flow of ions in the lumen. This decreases the lumen velocity and promotes the exchange of molecules through the capillary lining.|$|E
50|$|Since NO {{production}} {{is important in}} regulation of blood pressure and blood flow, thereby playing {{a significant role in}} cardiovascular diseases, tetrahydrobiopterin is a potential therapeutic target.

Increasing tetrahydrobiopterin in endothelial cells by augmenting the levels of the biosynthetic enzyme GTPCH can maintain endothelial NOS function in experimental models of disease states such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. However, treatment of patients with existing coronary artery disease with oral tetrahydrobiopterin is limited by oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin to the inactive form, dihydrobiopterin, with little benefit on vascular function.|$|E

50|$|Diffusion occurs {{through the}} walls of the vessels due to a {{concentration}} gradient, allowing the necessary exchange of ions, molecules, or blood cells. The permeability of a capillary wall is determined by the type of capillary and the surface of the endothelial cells. A continuous, tightly spaced endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>lining</b> only permits the diffusion of small molecules. Larger molecules and blood cells require adequate space between cells or holes in the lining. The high resistivity of a cellular membrane prevents the diffusion of ions without a membrane transport protein. The hydrophobicity of an endothelial cell surface determines whether water or lipophilic molecules will diffuse through the capillary lining. The blood brain barrier restricts diffusion to small hydrophobic molecules, making drug diffusion difficult to achieve.|$|E
