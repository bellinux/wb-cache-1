5000|$|Julia Child also echoes Escoffier: [...] "A {{mixture of}} fresh parsley, chives, tarragon, and chervil is called fines herbes," [...] while Alan Davidson, author of The Oxford Companion to Food, {{identifies}} <b>chopped</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>parsley</b> as the minimalist {{basis of the}} fines herbes mix, {{with the addition of}} [...] "any (or all) of: chervil, tarragon, chives," [...] noting that the number of different herbs to be used is far from fixed. Food scientist Harold McGee's definition, on the other hand, limits the number of fines herbes to tarragon, chervil, chive, and omits parsley altogether. McGee also recommends that the herbs be finely chopped using a sharp knife rather than a food processor, [...] "since food processors slice into herbs and introduce a lot of air and therefore aroma-altering oxygen." ...|$|E

5000|$|Outside of Mexico and Central America, the {{following}} salsas {{are common to}} each of {{the following}} regions; in Argentina and the Southern Cone, chimichurri sauce is common.

[...] In Costa Rica, dishes are prepared with salsa Lizano, a thin, smooth, light brown sauce. In Cuba and the Caribbean, a typical salsa is mojo. Unlike the tomato-based salsas, mojo typically consists of olive oil, garlic, and citrus juice, and is used both to marinate meats and as a dipping sauce. In Peru, a traditional salsa is peri peri or piri piri sauce: [...] "The national condiment of Peru, peri-peri sauce is made in medium to hot levels of spiciness—the more chili, or the hotter variety of chile used, the hotter the sauce. Original peri-peri uses the African bird’s eye chili (the African word for the chili is peri-peri). Milder sauces may use only cayenne and serrano chilies. To a base of vinegar and oil, garlic and lemon juice are added, plus other seasonings, which often include paprika or tomato paste for flavor and color, onions and herb—each company has its own recipe.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine {{allelopathic}} effect of parsley (Petroselinum crispum Mill.) on germination and growth parameters of weed species hoary cress (Lepidium draba (L.) Desv.). Cogermination of hoary cress with parsley seeds, water extracts from <b>fresh</b> and dry <b>parsley</b> biomass in concentrations of 5 and 10 % (50 and 100 g per litre of distilled water) were evaluated in Petri dishes. Effect of water extracts from <b>fresh</b> <b>parsley</b> biomass in aforementioned concentrations as well as effects of <b>fresh</b> and dry <b>parsley</b> residues in two rates (10 and 20 g/kg of soil) were examined in pots with soil. Cogermination of seeds stimulated root length, but decreased shoot length and fresh weight of hoary cress seedlings. In the Petri dish assay, extracts from <b>fresh</b> and dry <b>parsley</b> biomass reduced germination of hoary cress, but had both stimulatory as well as inhibitory effect on other parameters. The highest concentration of dry biomass extract completely reduced germination rate of hoary cress (by 100 %). In the pot experiment, extracts from <b>fresh</b> <b>parsley</b> biomass had stimulatory effect on weed growth parameters except for root length which was inhibited with higher concentration by 4. 2 %. <b>Fresh</b> <b>parsley</b> residues reduced germination, root and shoot length of hoary cress, while dry parsley residues promoted measured parameters, with the exception of root length...|$|R
