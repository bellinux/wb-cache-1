5000|$|On 6 February 1985, 1,500 {{troops and}} police were {{deployed}} {{to secure the}} seven-mile station perimeter for the Ministry of Defence. The operation {{has been described as}} [...] "perhaps the most dramatic occurrence in all the peace and anti-nuclear campaigns of the 1980s" [...] in the UK. The troops had been training for weeks in the rapid deployment of a three metre high, six roll, Dannert wire fence behind which a 5 metres wide no-man's land concrete roadway was constructed along the line of the fence and finally a 10-foot (three metre) high, Weldmesh steel fence was erected beyond that. Floodlights were installed every 100 yards and Ministry of Defence Police and armed guards were to patrol the fence 24 hours a day.

50|$|The {{following}} day, {{a handheld}} ICOM radio {{recovered from the}} body of a dead al-Qaeda fighter allowed members of the Delta squadron and the CIA to hear Bin laden'S voice - apparently apologising to his followers for leading them to Tora Bora and giving his blessing for their surrender - thought to be addressed to the terrorists that stayed to fight a rearguard action to allow Bin Laden to escape. Credible rumours of cash payments by Bin Laden to {{at least one of the}} warlords abound - the reluctance of the AMF to press the attack may have been influenced by similar bribes, the leader of the CIA Jawbreaker team at Tora Bora believes that two large al-Qaeda groups escaped. The smaller group of 130 jihadist escaped east into Pakistan, whilst the second group in including Bin Laden and 200 Saudi and Yemeni jihadist took the route across the mountains to the town of Parachinar, Pakistan; the Delta squadron commander believes that Bin Laden crossed the border into Pakistan sometime around 16 December. A Delta Recce team, callsign 'Jackal', spotted a tall man wearing a <b>camouflage</b> <b>jacket</b> with a large number of fighters entering a cave, the Recce team called in multiple airstrikes on the obvious presumption that it was Bin Laden, but later DNA analysis from the remains did not match Bin Laden's. With the majority of the terrorist gone the battle came to an end, official tallies of claiming hundreds of al-Qaeda killed at Tora Bora are difficult to confirm since many of the bodies were buried in caves or vaporised by bombs, only a handful of prisoners were taken.|$|R
