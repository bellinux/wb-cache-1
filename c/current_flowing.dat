5|$|The <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> {{from the}} {{ionosphere}} to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding {{part of the}} plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet. As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40RJ from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched. The strong direct <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about ° from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main auroral ovals. (See below.) The return <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> from the outer magnetosphere beyond 50RJ enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140million amperes.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{first began}} to {{consider}} the possibility of reaching the North Pole by using the natural drift of the polar ice when, in 1884, he read the theories of Henrik Mohn, the distinguished Norwegian meteorologist. Artifacts found on the Greenland coast had been identified as coming from the lost US Arctic exploration vessel Jeannette, which had been crushed and sunk in June 1881 {{on the opposite side of}} the Arctic Ocean, off the Siberian coast. Mohn surmised that the location of the artefacts indicated the existence of an ocean <b>current,</b> <b>flowing</b> from east to west all the way across the polar sea, possibly over the pole itself. A strong enough ship might therefore enter the frozen Siberian sea, and drift to the Greenland coast via the pole.|$|E
5|$|The summer aggregations of the short-tail {{stingray}} at the Poor Knights Islands seem to {{at least}} partly serve a reproductive purpose, as both mating and birthing have been observed among the gathered rays. Courtship and mating take place in mid-water, {{and it has been}} speculated that the rising <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> continuously through the narrow archways aids the rays in maintaining their position. Each receptive female may be followed by several males, who attempt to bite and grip her disc. One or two males may be dragged by the female for hours before she accedes; the successful male flips upside-down beneath her, inserting one of his claspers into her vent and rhythmically waving his tail from side to side. Copulation lasts 3–5 minutes. Females in captivity have been observed mating with up to three different males in succession.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, {{a neutral}} direct-current {{telegraph}} system (single-current system, single-current transmission system, single-Morse system) is a telegraph {{system in which}} (a) <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> during marking intervals and no <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> during spacing intervals for the transmission of signals over a line, and (b) the direction of <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> is immaterial.|$|R
25|$|Before {{the onset}} of the monsoon (March–May): During this season, shallow northward coastal <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> with 50–100km width near the Somali coast, {{overlying}} a southward undercurrent. By alongshore winds, upwelling <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> to the coast. Near the equator, the East African Coast <b>Current</b> (EACC) <b>flows</b> northward across the equator. The southern Somali <b>Current</b> <b>flows</b> northward {{as an extension of the}} EACC from south to the 3-4°N.|$|R
25|$|Fluorescent lamps are {{negative}} differential resistance devices, so as more <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> through them, the electrical {{resistance of the}} fluorescent lamp drops, allowing for even more <b>current</b> to <b>flow.</b> Connected directly to a constant-voltage power supply, a fluorescent lamp would rapidly self-destruct due to the uncontrolled <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> To prevent this, fluorescent lamps must use an auxiliary device, a ballast, to regulate the <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> through the lamp.|$|R
5|$|In {{a lecture}} given in 1884 to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters Dr. Henrik Mohn, {{one of the}} founders of modern meteorology, argued that the finding of the Jeannette relics {{indicated}} the existence of an ocean <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> from east to west across the entire Arctic Ocean. The Danish governor of Julianehaab, writing of the find, surmised that an expedition frozen into the Siberian sea might, if its ship were to prove strong enough, cross the polar ocean and land in South Greenland. These theories were read with interest by the 23-year-old Fridtjof Nansen, then working as a curator at the Bergen Museum while completing his doctoral studies. Nansen was already captivated by the frozen north; two years earlier he had experienced a four-month voyage on the sealer Viking, which had included three weeks trapped in drifting ice. An expert skier, Nansen was making plans to lead the first crossing of the Greenland icecap, an objective delayed by the demands of his academic studies, but triumphantly achieved in 1888–89. Through these years Nansen remembered the east–west Arctic drift theory and its inherent possibilities for further polar exploration, and shortly after his return from Greenland he was ready to announce his plans.|$|E
25|$|When two {{different}} metals are suspended in an electrolyte solution, direct <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> one {{way through the}} solution sees less resistance than in the other direction. Electrolytic rectifiers most commonly used an aluminum anode and a lead or steel cathode, suspended in a solution of tri-ammonium ortho-phosphate.|$|E
25|$|To {{analyze the}} {{transport}} of ions in the channel, behaviors of system in electrochemistry as well as fluid mechanics need to be considered. The Poisson–Nernst–Planck (PNP) equations are utilized to describe ionic <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through a channel, and the Navier–Stokes (NS) equations are used to represent the fluid dynamics in the channel.|$|E
5000|$|At any node (junction) in an {{electrical}} circuit, {{the sum of}} <b>currents</b> <b>flowing</b> into that node {{is equal to the}} sum of <b>currents</b> <b>flowing</b> out of that node ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{option is}} to have a DPDT relay to set the {{direction}} of <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> and a transistor to enable the <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> This can extend the relay life, as the relay will be switched while the transistor is off and thereby there is no <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> It also enables the use of PWM switching to control the current level.|$|R
50|$|Ripples are {{relatively}} small, elongated ridges that form on bed surfaces perpendicular to <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> With continuous <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> in one direction, asymmetrical ripples form. Asymmetrical ripples contain a steeper slope downstream. With an alternation in <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> from one direction {{to the opposite}} symmetrical ripples form. Symmetrical ripples tend {{to have the same}} slope {{on both sides of the}} crest.|$|R
25|$|Tubes {{on standby}} for long periods, with heater voltage applied, may develop high cathode {{interface}} resistance and display poor emission characteristics. This effect occurred especially in pulse and digital circuits, where tubes had no plate <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> for extended times. Tubes {{designed specifically for}} this mode of operation were made.|$|E
25|$|Both FBDIMM (fully buffered) and LRDIMM (load reduced) memory {{types are}} {{designed}} primarily {{to control the}} amount of electric <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> {{to and from the}} memory chips at any given time. They are not compatible with registered/buffered memory, and motherboards that require them usually will not accept any other kind of memory.|$|E
25|$|Coaxial cables are {{commonly}} used at audio frequencies and above for convenience. A coaxial cable has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube, separated by a dielectric layer. The <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> {{on the surface of}} the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> on the inner surface of the outer tube. The electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube, and (ideally) no energy is lost to radiation or coupling outside the tube. Coaxial cables have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about 5GHz. For microwave frequencies greater than 5GHz, the losses (due mainly to the electrical resistance of the central conductor) become too large, making waveguides a more efficient medium for transmitting energy. Coaxial cables with an air rather than solid dielectric are preferred as they transmit power with lower loss.|$|E
5000|$|High voltage (over about 600 volts). In {{addition}} to greater <b>current</b> <b>flow,</b> high voltage may cause dielectric breakdown at the skin, thus lowering skin resistance and allowing further increased <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{polarity}} (positive and negative) is {{the direction}} of <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> in an electrical circuit. <b>Current</b> <b>flows</b> from the positive pole (terminal) to the negative pole. Electrons flow from negative to positive. In a direct current (DC) circuit, <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> in one direction only, and one pole is always negative and the other pole is always positive. In an alternating current (AC) circuit the two poles alternate between negative and positive and {{the direction of}} the <b>current</b> (electron <b>flow)</b> reverses periodically.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} diodes, <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> easily from p-type to n-type material.However, no <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> and no light is emitted if a small voltage is {{applied in the}} reverse direction. If the reverse voltage grows large enough to exceed the {{breakdown}} voltage, a large <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> and the LED may be damaged. If the reverse current is sufficiently limited to avoid damage, the reverse-conducting LED is a useful noise diode.|$|R
25|$|The {{relation}} between current and applied voltage illustrates {{the nature of}} the photoelectric effect. For discussion, a light source illuminates a plate P, and another plate electrode Q collects any emitted electrons. We vary the potential between P and Q and measure the <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> in the external circuit between the two plates.|$|E
25|$|Simulates an {{inductor}} (i.e., provides inductance {{without the}} use of a possibly costly inductor). The circuit exploits the fact that the <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through a capacitor behaves through time as the voltage across an inductor. The capacitor used in this circuit is smaller than the inductor it simulates and its capacitance is less subject to changes in value due to environmental changes.|$|E
25|$|Dissimilar buried metals such as {{copper and}} steel can {{function}} as the poles of a galvanic cell, using moist soil as the electrolyte. Stray direct currents in soil may counteract the anti-corrosion effect of a cathodic protection system. Design of high voltage direct current transmission systems must take care so that <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> in the earth does not cause objectionable corrosion to buried objects such as pipelines.|$|E
3000|$|... 2 is obtained. Since {{the ground}} {{effects of the}} electrojets are largely due to roughly east–west aligned (nominally Hall) <b>current</b> <b>flow,</b> this simple {{technique}} allows the basic parameters of this <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> to be determined.|$|R
50|$|Two {{variants}} of GMR {{have been applied}} in devices: (1) current-in-plane (CIP), where the electric <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> parallel to the layers and (2) current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP), where the electric <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> in a direction perpendicular to the layers.|$|R
25|$|Inductive coils in {{electronics}} typically use magnetic cores {{to minimize}} parasitic <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> They are {{a mixture of}} metal powder plus a resin binder that can hold any shape. The binder prevents parasitic <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> through the powdered metal.|$|R
25|$|The {{magnetization}} {{state of}} a MTJ {{can be controlled}} by Spin-transfer torque, and can thus, through this intrinsic physical mechanism, exhibit memristive behavior. This spin torque is induced by <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through the junction, and leads to an efficient means of achieving a MRAM. However, {{the length of time}} the current flows through the junction determines the amount of current needed, i.e., charge is the key variable.|$|E
25|$|A {{hypervelocity}} railgun {{works very}} much like a particle accelerator insofar as it converts electrical potential energy into kinetic energy imparted to the projectile. A conductive pellet (the projectile) is attracted down the rails by electric <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through a rail. Through the magnetic forces that this system achieves, a force is exerted on the projectile moving it down the rail. Railguns can generate muzzle-velocities in excess of 2.4 kilometers per second.|$|E
25|$|A modern {{electrometer}} is {{a highly}} sensitive electronic voltmeter whose input impedance is so high that the <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> into it can be considered, for most practical purposes, to be zero. The actual value of input resistance for modern electronic electrometers is around 1014Ω, compared to around 1010Ω for nanovoltmeters. Owing to the extremely high input impedance, special design considerations must be applied to avoid leakage current such as driven shields and special insulation materials.|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of Crofer 22 APU was studied under simulated SOFC interconnection operating conditions. Crofer 22 APU {{samples were}} exposed to cathodic conditions, i. e. air on one side, and anodic conditions, i. e. fuel (hydrogen) on the other side, with an externally imposed <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> simulating the passage of current. Preliminary {{results indicate that the}} composition of the oxide scale formed on the fuel side of the alloy with the externally imposed <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> was significantly {{different from that of the}} oxide scale formed when there was no <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> However, the results indicate that the <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> has no significant effect on the composition of the oxide scale on the air side...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, {{in order}} to improve the {{electrical}} conduction of Mg-doped p-type GaN contacts, enhancement of hydrogen release from GaN substrates is attempted. The electrical conduction profiles of the p-type GaN/Ni contact annealed at 573 K and 673 K for 3600 s while subjected to <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> show some improvement compared to the contact annealed without applying the <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> From these results, it can be understood that by applying <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> through the GaN substrates during annealing process, hydrogen release form GaN substrates can be enhanced by even annealing at low temperature. To understand the mechanism of hydrogen release by applying <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> during annealing, the change in current values p-type GaN contacts during annealing has been observed. By using regression analysis and kinetic model, the electrical conduction improvement achieve by applying <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> through GaN substrate during annealing have been analysis. The results suggest that that by applying <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> during annealing and by forming a contact with material that H can diffuse into such as Pd, the H release from GaN substrate can be enhanced and the electrical conduction of p-type GaN contact can be significantly improved...|$|R
40|$|The {{computation}} of nodes centrality is {{of great}} importance {{for the analysis of}} graphs. The <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness is an interesting centrality index that is computed by considering how the information travels along all the possible paths of a graph. The <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness exploits basic results from electrical circuits, i. e. Kirchhoff 2 ̆ 7 s laws, to evaluate the centrality of vertices. The computation of the <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness may exceed the computational capability of a single machine for very large graphs composed by millions of nodes. In this paper we propose a solution that estimates the <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness in a distributed setting, by defining a vertex-centric, gossip-based algorithm. Each node, relying on its local information, in a self-adaptive way generates new flows to improve the betweenness of all the nodes of the graph. Our experimental evaluation shows that our proposal achieves high correlation with the exact <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness, and provides a good centrality measure for large graphs...|$|R
25|$|Electrically, RO is a {{resistance}} {{controlled by the}} <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through the light source. In the dark state, the resistance typically exceeds a few MOhm; when illuminated, it decreases as the inverse of the light intensity. In contrast to the photodiode and phototransistor, the photoresistor can operate in both the AC and DC circuits and have a voltage of several hundred volts across it. The harmonic distortions of the output current by the RO are typically within 0.1% at voltages below 0.5 V.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in strength of magnetic field lines towards the Earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back {{many of the}} downward flowing electrons. The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector). This greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, and thereby the rates of ionisation, excitation and consequent emission of auroral light. Acceleration also increases the electron <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.|$|E
25|$|By {{applying}} {{an additional}} electrode on a nanochannel as the gate electrode, {{it is possible}} to adjust the electrical potential inside the channel. A nanofluidic field-effect transistor can be made of silica nanotubes with an oxide as the dielectric material between the metal gate electrode and the channel. The tuning of the ionic current, therefore, can be achieved by changing the voltage applied on the gate. The gate bias and the source-drain bias are applied to adjust the cation and anion concentration within the nanochannel, therefore tuning the ionic <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through it.|$|E
30|$|Pressure {{gradients}} {{are created}} in the magnetosphere which induce electric <b>currents</b> <b>flowing</b> orthogonally to the magnetic field. These pressure gradients are mainly due to the ions, because their pressure {{is larger than the}} one of the electrons. The divergence of these orthogonal electric currents generates electric <b>currents</b> <b>flowing</b> along the magnetic field lines, the so-called field-aligned currents. They close in the ionosphere and induce electric <b>currents</b> <b>flowing</b> horizontally in the ionosphere. They correspond to a second coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere.|$|R

In quadrants 3 and 4, MT2 is negative, and <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> from MT1 to MT2, also through P, N, P and N layers. The N region attached to MT2 is active, but the N region attached to MT1 only {{participates in the}} initial triggering, not the bulk <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|R
