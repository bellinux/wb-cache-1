5|$|Nevertheless, Curse was {{generally}} well received upon its release, especially by the Amiga magazines, where the game's graphics and animation received particular praise even as its illogical puzzles and unusual design <b>choices</b> <b>were</b> often criticized. A direct sequel was briefly planned but eventually {{turned into a}} spiritual successor game titled Universe and released in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Newfoundland {{recommended}} that the British Government hold a referendum on Newfoundland's future. London agreed that a referendum was a good idea, and left {{it up to the}} Convention to decide what was to be on the ballot.

40|$|<b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the central}} {{elements}} in the experience of free will, but it has not received a good account from either compatibilists or libertarians. This paper develops an account of choice based around three features: (i) <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> an action; (ii) <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> not determined by one's prior beliefs and desires; (iii) once the question of what to do has arisen, <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> typically both necessary and sufficient for moving to action. These features might appear to support a libertarian account, but they do not. Instead it is argued that all three features can be accommodated within a compatibilist account, where <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> needed because of agents' inabilities to arrive at judgements about what <b>is</b> best. <b>Choice</b> differs though from random picking: in choosing, agents frequently (though not always) deploy abilities that enable them to make good choices. In such cases, judgements about what is best will frequently follow the <b>choice.</b> Finally, <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> distinguished from agency and, {{on the basis of the}} distinction, the claim that <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> an action is made good...|$|R
5|$|Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as {{philosophers}} Antony Flew, {{have responded}} that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist view {{of free will}} (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a compatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible). The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their <b>choices</b> <b>were</b> predestined.|$|E
5|$|Following the Wales Test Dixon and the WRU {{continued}} to clash over referee appointments. The dispute escalated {{to the point}} where Dixon threatened {{to pull out of the}} All Blacks' remaining Welsh fixtures. The WRU responded by threatening to cancel the fixtures if their referee <b>choices</b> <b>were</b> rejected. The dispute was resolved when the chairman of the RFU, Rowland Hill, got the WRU to accept Gil Evans (a Welshman from Birmingham) as referee for the final three matches. Gil Evans had refereed the All Blacks versus England Test and was well respected by the New Zealanders.|$|E
5|$|In China, the Camry was {{unveiled}} in late April 2006 and commenced production in June. The Camry {{is sold in}} two variantsâ€”the 200 and 240. The 200 variant is mated to the 2.0-litre 1AZ-FE while 240 variant gets the 2.4-litre 2AZ-FE. The range consisted of the 200E, 200GVP, 200G, 200GN, 200GGB, 240GVP, 240G, 240GN, 240GGB, 240V, 240VN and the 240VGB.

5000|$|Deliberate choice (proairesis), [...] "seems to {{determine}} one's character more than one's actions do". Things {{done on the}} spur of the moment, and things done by animals and children can be willing, but driven by desire and spirit and not what we would normally call true <b>choice.</b> <b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> rational, and according to the understanding of Aristotle, <b>choice</b> can <b>be</b> in opposition to desire. <b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> also not wishing for things one does not believe can be achieved, such as immortality, but rather always concerning realistic aims. <b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> also not simply to do with opinion, because our choices make us the type of person we are, and are not simply true or false. What distinguishes <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> that before a <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> made there is a rational deliberation or thinking things through.|$|R
40|$|<b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> a key {{theme in}} current {{government}} policy within the United Kingdom. Present {{as an important}} value for the delivery of public services, of particular interest here <b>is</b> <b>choice</b> {{at the end of}} life. By focusing on older people residing in care homes, a number of questions are raised about the implications of this aspiration. What does choice mean for older people who are societally marginalised and live in a care setting that sits, primarily, outside public provision? Aspects of <b>choice</b> <b>are</b> explored here with respect to when <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> offered, what care is provided and where this occurs. Both the context of care and the population to whom <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> to be offered shape the nature of <b>choice</b> as <b>is</b> outlined here...|$|R

5|$|In December 1811, Maria MacGregor died. At {{a stroke}} MacGregor lost his {{main source of}} income {{and the support of}} the {{influential}} Bowater family. His <b>choices</b> <b>were,</b> Sinclair suggests, limited: announcing his engagement to another heiress so soon after Maria's death might draw embarrassing public protests from the Bowaters, and returning home to farm the MacGregor lands in Scotland would be in his mind unacceptably dull. His only real experience was military, but the manner of his exit from the British Army would make a return there awkward at best.|$|E
5|$|In late April 2014, Connie {{performed}} {{a couple of}} concerts in South Korea (Osan and Seoul). These concerts, performed shortly after the horrendous Sewol ferry tragedy, were delivered with much personal consideration by Connie {{to make sure that}} all song <b>choices</b> <b>were</b> appropriate. Connie performed with yellow ribbons to show her respect for the families of the victims. The proceeds from at least one of the concerts were donated to the fundraising efforts in support of the families of the victims.|$|E
5|$|One action RPG that avoided these {{limitations}} is Deus Ex (2000), designed by Warren Spector. It offered multiple {{solutions to problems}} through intricately layered dialogue choices, a deep skill tree, and hand-crafted environments. Players were challenged to act in character through dialog choices appropriate {{to his or her}} chosen role, and by intelligent use of the surrounding environment. This produced a unique experience that was tailored to each player. According to Spector, the game's dialogue <b>choices</b> <b>were</b> inspired by a console role-playing game, Suikoden.|$|E

Cliques are groups of three or more people within a larger group who all choose each other (Mutual Choice).|$|R
40|$|The <b>choice</b> {{operator}} <b>is</b> {{essential for}} the description of action-based reactive systems. If the atomicity of actions is dropped (e. g. by action refinement), one has to decide when the <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> triggered. The standard approach is to trigger the choice when actions start. This thesis examine the alternative approach that the <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> triggered when actions terminate. This end-based <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> motivated and a process algebra, which contains an end-based choice and an action refinement operator, is established. Consistent semantics (operational, denotational, axiomatical) are given. Furthermore, {{the difference between the}} start-based and the end-based <b>choice</b> <b>are</b> examined, in particular with respect to equivalence notions. New equivalence are established, since the standard equivalences are not preserved by the end-based action refinement operator...|$|R

Their response, along with two other <b>choices,</b> <b>were</b> provided to the other two contestants, who selected one of the choices. Correct answers earned three spins for a buzz-in answer and one spin for a multiple choice answer. After five questions, all three contestants advanced to the final round.|$|E
5|$|Writer Rhianna Pratchett {{has said}} that the game's story {{examined}} why citizens would accept a life in a society where their personal <b>choices</b> <b>were</b> very limited. It also looked at reasons people might have for attempting to live outside the system and what could result from this. The society portrayed in the game was somewhere between what George Orwell described as an 'anti-utopia' and a Nanny State.|$|E
5|$|Charles' <b>choices</b> <b>were</b> appropriate. Philip was {{culturally}} Spanish: he {{was born}} in Valladolid and raised in the Spanish court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in Spain. Ferdinand was familiar with, and to, the other princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Although he too had been born in Spain, he had administered his brother's affairs in the Empire since 1531. Some historians maintain Ferdinand had also been touched by the reformed philosophies, and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire ever came to a Protestant emperor; he remained at least nominally a Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed. Other historians maintain that while Ferdinand was a practicing Catholic, unlike his brother he considered religion to be outside the political sphere.|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} difference between context-free grammars and parsing expression grammars is that the PEG's <b>choice</b> operator <b>is</b> ordered. If the first alternative succeeds, the second alternative is ignored. Thus ordered <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> not commutative, unlike unordered choice as in context-free grammars. Ordered <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> analogous to soft cut operators available in some logic programming languages.|$|R

5|$|Michael J. Fox was {{the first}} choice to play Marty McFly, but he was {{committed}} to the show Family Ties. Family Ties producer Gary David Goldberg felt that Fox was essential to the show's success. With co-star Meredith Baxter on maternity leave, he refused to allow Fox time off {{to work on a}} film. Back to the Future was originally scheduled for a May 1985 release and it was late 1984 when it was learned that Fox would be unable to star in the film. Zemeckis' next two <b>choices</b> <b>were</b> C. Thomas Howell and Eric Stoltz. Stoltz impressed the producers enough with his earlier portrayal of Roy L. Dennis in Mask (which had yet to be released) that they selected him to play Marty McFly. Because of the difficult casting process, the start date was pushed back twice.|$|E
5|$|The main Divas feud {{entering}} {{the event was}} between Christy Hemme and Carmella DeCesare, the two finalists in the Raw Diva Search. On the September 20 episode of Raw, Christy was announced as {{the winner of the}} Diva Search and received a one-year contract with WWE and $250,000. After the Diva Search, Carmella became a villainess and began a feud with Christy, due to jealousy of Christy winning the Diva Search. On the last edition of Raw before Taboo Tuesday, it was announced that Christy and Carmella would face each other at the pay-per-view with the fans choosing what type of match they would compete in. The <b>choices</b> <b>were</b> a Lingerie Pillow Fight, an Evening Gown Match, or an Aerobics Challenge. After the announcement was made, Carmella attacked Christy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{enjoyment}} {{factored into}} Culverhouse's {{purchase of the}} Buccaneers, it was {{first and foremost a}} business decision which he expected to be profitable. He admitted to being known for his frugality, due to moves such as wearing outdated clothing, and having the One Buc Place walls painted white to avoid having to spend money on projection screens. This was not initially a problem for the franchise, even though the budget airplane that Culverhouse chartered for the team almost crashed after their very first game; original coach John McKay reported in 1978 that Culverhouse had never blocked any deals, even those involving a great amount of money. Later, however, the team let go or traded away many of its players who were highly paid and/or demanded more money, including Dave Pear, Doug Williams, Ricky Reynolds, Reggie Cobb, Mark Carrier, and Jeris White. First-round draft <b>choices</b> <b>were</b> frequently traded for players who were not considered to be of equal value, as when the team traded for often-injured defensive end Wally Chambers without requiring that he first pass a physical examination. Frustration over being beaten by players he had pleaded with Culverhouse to sign contributed to the resignation of McKay. He also fired well-regarded personnel director Ken Herock, when Herock demanded to be paid in line with his value around the league.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Ireland declared neutrality. There were a total of 56 Irish ships at {{the outbreak}} of World War II; 15 more were purchased or leased in the conflict, and 16 were lost. Up to then most Irish-registered ships had been flying the red ensign of the United Kingdom Merchant Navy. All were required by UK law to fly the Red Ensign, but some, such as the Wexford Steamship Company ships, had always travelled under the tricolour. With {{the outbreak of}} hostilities, <b>choices</b> <b>were</b> forced. The Irish government ordered all Irish ships to fly the tricolour. Some British ships were on the Irish register, such as the whalers which were Scottish-owned (Christian Salvesen Shipping) but Irish-registered in order {{to take advantage of the}} Irish whale quota. The six whale catchers and the two factory ships were pressed into British naval service, after their owners transferred them to the British registry. Some ships which could be described as British also choose the Tricolour. Kerrymore, which was registered as belonging to R McGowan of Tralee, was actually owned by Kelly Colliers of Belfast. Most of the crew had addresses in loyalist areas of Belfast. For six years they sailed under the tricolour.|$|E
5|$|Overall, 36 draft {{selections}} were made, {{the most}} since the original draft in 2002 (which featured 57 selections). Twelve selections {{were made on}} television; six were made by Raw, five by SmackDown, and one by ECW. All of the draftees were wrestlers: 28 males (10 drafted on television) and 8 females (2 drafted on television). Raw obtained the first overall {{pick in the draft}} by winning the first match, which resulted in the acquisition of United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter from SmackDown. Women's Champion Melina from Raw was SmackDown's first selection. ECW's sole televised draft pick was Vladimir Kozlov from SmackDown. Additionally, SmackDown's WWE Champion Triple H was drafted by Raw, resulting in SmackDown's loss of its prime championship. At the end of the televised portion, the final draft <b>choices</b> <b>were</b> Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio of Raw by SmackDown, replacing the loss of the U.S. Champion, and SmackDown's Divas Champion Maryse by Raw, replacing the loss of the Women's Champion.|$|E
5|$|They were {{obliged to}} record their first album at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London, overseen by {{producer}} Norman Smith, a central figure in Pink Floyd's negotiations with EMI. Balance engineer Pete Bown, who had mentored Smith, helped ensure that the album had a unique sound, through his experimentation with equipment and recording techniques. Bown, assisted by studio manager David Harris, set up microphones {{an hour before the}} sessions began. Bown's microphone <b>choices</b> <b>were</b> mostly different from those used by Smith to record the Beatles' EMI sessions. Because of Barrett's quiet voice, he was placed in a vocal isolation booth to sing his parts. Automatic double tracking (ADT) was used to add layers of echo to the vocals and to some instruments. The album featured an unusually heavy use of echo and reverberation to give it its own unique sound. Much of the reverberation effect came from a set of Elektro-Mess-Technik plate reverberatorsâ€“ customised EMT 140s containing thin metal plates under tensionâ€“ and the studio's tiled echo chamber built in 1931.|$|E
