This paper highlights the survey results of the excess sludge generated from activated sludge treatment plants of the <b>concentrated</b> <b>latex</b> factories, including sludge generation rate, sludge characteristics, as well as sludge management and its problems. The total number of 11 factories was investigated. The findings showed that 20 % of the investigated factories using activated sludge did not know how much the excess sludge generation rate was. With an in-depth investigation, the excess sludge generation rate was determined as for 28 kg/ton <b>concentrated</b> <b>latex</b> product or 10 kg/ton of field latex used in the <b>concentrated</b> <b>latex</b> factories.

The effect of storage times with ∼ 0, 15, 30 and 45 days for <b>concentrated</b> NR <b>latex</b> with different ammonia contents on their properties such as alkalinity, magnesium content and viscosity was observed. It was found that generally, magnesium content in field NR <b>latex</b> and <b>latex</b> <b>concentrate</b> decreased with storage period times. The alkalinity content in both concentrated NR and skim latex increased with increasing ammonia content in field latex. The viscosity of <b>concentrated</b> NR <b>latex</b> increased as a function of storage period time of field NR latex.

We present {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} associated with the production of fresh latex, and three primary rubber products, including <b>concentrated</b> <b>latex,</b> block rubber (STR 20), and ribbed smoked sheet (RSS) in Thailand. Besides industrial activities in the rubber mills, the agricultural activities in rubber tree plantation are taken into account. The overall emissions from the production of <b>concentrated</b> <b>latex,</b> STR 20, and RSS amount to 0. 54, 0. 70, and 0. 64 ton CO 2 -eq/ton product, respectively. This is for the case that rubber plantations have been located on cultivated lands for more than 60 years, which is current practice in most of Thailand. Emissions are largely associated with energy use and the use of synthetic fertilizers. We also quantify emissions for the case that tropical forests have been converted to rubber plantations relatively recently, which is a recent trend in Thailand. In this case the emissions are much higher because of carbon loss from land conversion: 13, 13, and 21 ton CO 2 -eq/ton product for <b>concentrated</b> <b>latex,</b> STR 20, and RSS, respectively.

40|$|Thailand is {{currently}} the world's largest natural rubber producer. To maintain a leadership position of natural rubber producer, it has been challenging for Thai rubber entrepreneurs to seek appropriate measures towards producing environmentally friendly rubber products. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess the potential environmental impact of <b>concentrated</b> <b>latex</b> production by partial Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and to investigate the effects of the options to reduce the impact. The methodology is based on the ISO 14040 series, taking a "Gate-to-Gate" approach (Partial LCA). The activities taken into account include production of chemicals, production of diesel and electricity, diesel combustion, and wastewater treatment. The functional unit is 1 ton of <b>concentrated</b> <b>latex,</b> and the environmental impacts considered in this study include global warming, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, photochemical oxidation, and the total environmental impact. The results indicate that electricity use for centrifugation has the largest share, compared with other activities, in global warming (50 %), acidification (58 %), and photochemical oxidation (55 %). Ammonia use for latex preservation accounts for 37 % of human toxicity, whereas use of DAP (Diammonium phosphate) accounts for 46 % of eutrophication. Based on these results, the following reduction options are therefore identified: 1) electricity efficiency improvement (by installation of inverters to centrifugal machines); 2) improvement of ammonia preparation and storage (by chilling systems); 3) minimizing the use of DAP (by extending coagulation time); and 4) substitution of diesel by LPG.

The large global market of concrete products could usefully consume this waste, {{even if the}} fractions used were very low, provided such concrete mix had sufficient strength and other characteristics. Therefore, the properties of concrete mixes that include natural rubber were studied at 28 days of age, which is a standard time to characterize hardened concrete properties. We included two types of natural rubber in this study, namely natural rubber latex (NRL) and discarded rubber glove. First, 60 % <b>concentrate</b> <b>latex</b> (HA: high ammonia) was used in latex per cement ratio 0. 10 by volume. Second, discarded rubber gloves, passed through a # 6 sieve with 3. 36 mm size, were used to investigate effects of soft rubber particles, on strength and insulation properties of lightweight concrete. The hybrid rubberized concrete mixes had 0 %, 10 %, 20 % and 40 % partial substitution of sand by volume, at water-cement ratio of 0. 45 by volume. Density, compressive strength, flexural strength, insulation property, and {{coefficient of thermal conductivity}} were measured. A small 10 % fraction of rubber particles improved flexural strength. However, compressive strength decreased with the amount of rubber in concrete. The thermal conductivity was slightly lower than that of normal concrete. Natural rubber addition can produce a moderately lightweight concrete, with good thermal insulation, and the inclusion of rubber glove waste in concrete aggregate appears feasible. Applications could also include non-primary structural uses with medium to low strength requirements, benefiting from other features of concrete. The results suggest that waste rubber can be used to create value-added concrete composites with sufficient structural strength, and improved thermal insulation...|$|R

It was found that percentage conversion for the reaction using DPNR is higher than that of graft copolymerisation of high ammonia <b>concentrated</b> natural rubber <b>latex</b> at every mole ratio of natural rubber to MMA (tested on mole ratio of NR:MMA = 95 : 5, 90 : 10, 80 : 20, 70 : 30 and 60 : 40, respectively). Grafting efficiency indicates percentage of grafted poly (methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) and grafted natural rubber molecules. It was found that the grafting efficiency decreased with mole ratio of natural rubber to MMA for both types of latex. However, graft copolymerisation of DPNR exhibits higher grafting efficiency. Grafted PMMA was examined by means of extraction and absorption ratio of infrared spectrum at the wave number of 1732 cm - 1 to 835 cm - 1. The results showed higher PMMA content in graft copolymer of DPNR. Also an increasing trend of PMMA content in graft copolymer was found for graft copolymerisation of both types of latex. Average particle size of DPNR was larger than that of field natural latex. As may be expected, the particle size of graft copolymer was larger than the starting latex particles. It was also found that particle size of graft copolymer of DPNR is larger than that of its counterpart. The difference between the behaviour of DPNR and untreated high ammonia <b>concentrated</b> natural rubber <b>latex</b> was due to the removal of protein.

However, there is limited research into the use of the liquid form of NR, i. e. <b>concentrated</b> NR <b>latex,</b> as an asphalt binder modifier. Compared to NR powder, NR latex is cheaper and more accessible in some countries, and potentially creates viscosity-reducing foams in the modified binder during mixture production. In this research, asphalt binders modified with different amount of NR latex were systematically studied, including the rotational viscosities, rutting resistance, fatigue resistance, low-temperature behaviour and temperature sensitivity. The dispersion of the NR latex in the modified binders was examined using fluorescence microscope and atomic force microscope. Test results indicate that the addition of NR latex increases the viscosity and elastic recovery of the modified binders and potentially enhances asphalt pavements' resistance to rutting, thermal cracking and fatigue damage. The NR latex also reduces the temperature sensitivity of the modified binders. The optimum NR latex content was found to be 7 % of the total mass of the modified binder. A network of extensive microstructures mixed with bubbles was identified in the modified binders under heat.

40|$|Epoxidised {{natural rubber}} (ENR) was {{prepared}} using high ammonia <b>concentrated</b> <b>latex,</b> performic acid and non-ionic surfactant (Emulwin W). The presence {{and quantity of}} epoxide groups in the natural rubber molecules were analysed using infrared spectroscopy. The characteristic peaks of epoxide groups at the wave numbers 870 and 1140 cm - 1 were observed. The quantities of epoxide groups were found to depend on reaction temperature and reaction time. Glass transition temperature (Tg) of epoxidised natural rubber was {{higher than that of}} natural rubber. The Tg increased with increasing level of epoxide groups in the natural rubber molecules in a linear manner. Mooney viscosity increased with increasing the level of epoxide groups. Furthermore, shear stress and shear viscosity increased with increasing epoxide content in NR molecules. Pseudoplastic behaviour was observed for the flow of ENR melt at 100 o C. That is, shear viscosities decreased with increasing shear rates (shear-thinning behaviour). Thai corresponds to the power-law equation, where the power law index (n) of ENR was in the range of 0. 20 to 0. 31. Therefore, plug-like flow profiles obviously occurred. The power law index (n) decreased with increasing epoxide content. However, the consistency index (K) increased with increasing the quantities of epoxide on the NR molecoules...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work was aimed {{to prepare the}} natural rubber bound 4 -aminodiphenylamine (NRbound- 4 -ADPA) for replacing typical antioxidant used in the conventional rubber formulation. Epoxidized natural rubber with 30 %mol epoxide (ENR- 30) was first prepared by performicepoxidation using high ammonia <b>concentrated</b> <b>latex</b> (60 % DRC), Teric N- 10 stabilizer, HCOOH/H 2 O 2 at 50 oC for 6 hr and 15 min. Reaction of ENR- 30 with 4 -aminodiphenylamine (4 -ADPA) was thencarried out in toluene solution at 80 oC for 3, 6, 12 and 12 hrs. The content of 4 -ADPA bound tonatural rubber molecules was determined by using standard curve of ENR- 30 / 4 -ADPA physicalmixing method. It {{was found that the}} level of bound 4 -ADPA was 1. 0, 1. 48, 2. 61 and 3. 95 phr,respectively. The molecular characteristics of ENR and NR-bound- 4 -ADPA were also investigated bymeans of IR spectroscopy. The absorption bands at 870 cm- 1 and 1596 cm- 1 corresponding to epoxidegroup and secondary amine in NR-bound- 4 -ADPA were observed, respectively. The antioxidantcapability of NR-bound- 4 -ADPA and conventional 4 -ADPA antioxidant in natural rubbervulcanizates was then studied. Improvement of ageing resistance of NR-bound- 4 -ADPA wasobserved. That is the NR-bound- 4 -ADPA showed superior oxidation resistance than that of theconventional antioxidant...|$|E
40|$|Volatile Fatty Acid number (VFA no.) {{is one of}} the {{parameters}} indicating the state of quality of Para rubber latex at that particular time. Most factories analyze this parameter using standard analytical method as in ISO 506 : 1992 (E). Nevertheless, this procedure is complicated, chemical and time consuming, as well as skilled analyst required. Therefore, near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy which is rapid, accurate and nonchemicals method was applied to determine the VFA no. in field latex and <b>concentrated</b> <b>latex</b> based on quantification and discriminant model. The best calibration equation was obtained from standard normal variate (SNV) spectra in the region of 6109. 7 – 5770. 3, 4613. 1 – 4242. 9 cm- 1 with R = 0. 832, SECV = 0. 036 and no bias. From the performance check, statistically it was found that SECV and bias were low enough for practical acceptance and the predicted VFA no. was not different significantly from actual VFA no. at 95 % confidence intervals. In addition, discriminant model was developed to separate good quality latex from the deteriorated latex using VFA no. at 0. 06 as standard as in ISO 2004 : 2010 (E). The discriminant model can be used to screen the latex with overall accuracy of 91. 86 % in validation set...|$|E
40|$|Ammonia {{removal from}} skim latex is an {{essential}} step in skim block production process. In general, skim latex contains about 0. 4 % ammonia by weight of skim latex {{and needs to be}} reduced in order to minimize acid usage during rubber coagulation step. The method used to remove ammonia from skim <b>latex</b> in many <b>concentrated</b> rubber <b>latex</b> plants is ammonia volatilization by agitating skim latex using a large agitator in a mixing pool. In this research, a new method to remove ammonia from water by blowing wind over the water surface was investigated. The effects of agitation speed and wind speed on overall mass transfer coefficient and removal rate of ammonia were investigated in a pilot scale experiment. The result has shown that the overall mass transfer coefficient and the ammonia removal rate increase linearly with increasing Reynolds number of air and liquid. However, the ammonia removal rate by using wind speed was much higher than that given by agitation method. The wind speed method proposed in this study is then recommended for ammonia removal from skim latex. Possible ways for applying the wind speed method for skim latex production plant are also suggested. The relationship between the wind speed or Reynolds number and the mass transfer coefficient {{can also be used to}} design the system for ammonia removal from water byusing wind speed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{identified}} and characterized a major latex lectin - designated as EtLLH - with antimicrobial activity from the succulent African milk tree Euphorbia trigona. The lectin is highly <b>concentrated</b> in the <b>latex</b> of E. trigona {{and appears to be}} composed of at least two subunits with a molecular mass of 32 kDa. EtLLH shares significant similarities to known plant lectins - ricin from Ricinus communis and agglutinin from Viscum album coloratum - which specifically bind D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, the major building blocks of many fungal cell walls. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed an impact of EtLLH on three phytopathogenic filamentous ascomycetes. The germination of the conidiospores and the hyphal growth of Aspergillus niger and Fusarium graminearum were severely inhibited by EtLLH already at concentrations below 0. 1 mg cm- 3, while the effect on germination of the melanized conidiospores of Botrytis cinerea was less significant...|$|R
40|$|Compressive, {{indirect}} tensile, and flexural strengths {{characteristics of}} natural rubber latex modified concrete (NRLMC) were studied and reported — Part I. In addition, a comparative investigation between normal concrete (NC) and NRLMC, conducted on fire endurance was also presented — Part II. Normal and modified elements containing latex–water ratios within 0 – 10 % were prepared and cured {{in accordance with}} the Japan Industrial Standard. Fire endurance capacity was assessed at five temperature levels; ambient temperature (27 °C), 150, 300, 500, and 800 °C. However, elevated heating (800 – 1300 °C) was further applied for the purpose of monitoring behavior at the verge of disintegration. Specimens were allowed to cool in the oven prior to compressive strength tests until room temperature is attained. Test results indicate that significant mechanical capabilities could be achieved by the inclusion of an appropriate quantity of <b>latex</b> <b>concentrate</b> and proper selection of befitting curing regime. Interestingly, the superiority of NRLMC over NC is maintained even under fire, up to the critical limit of latex-film capability performance...|$|R
