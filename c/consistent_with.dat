The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> excavation of mantle material.

5|$|Since {{forces are}} {{perceived}} as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions that are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E

5|$|Wright met Darwin in {{the early}} 1760s, {{probably}} through their common connection of John Whitehurst, first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when {{he stayed in the}} Darwin household for a week. The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> Darwin's flamboyant character, {{it is more likely that}} this is Dr William Small. The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle.|$|E
