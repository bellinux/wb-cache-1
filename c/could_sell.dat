The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from the Hillsborough River being pumped into the city's water treatment plant, and a new dam was eventually built in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, {{there was still}} a chance the book <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision would be made after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues.

The merged company {{retained}} the obligation to operate dining services on the trains, which throughout the 1980s necessitated considerable subsidies from NSB. In 1988, NSB decided to organize {{the operation of the}} dining services through tendered contracts; the first contract (from 1990 through 1995) was won by TogService, a Narvesen subsidiary. The owners had an agreement that neither <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> without the approval of the other. In 1995 NSB sold its shares with Fritt Ord's approval, and the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the show, the staff was forced by the Fox network into doing clip shows to save money. There was {{originally}} intense pressure on the producers of the show to create extra episodes in each season, and the plan was to make four clip shows per season to meet that limit. Writers and producers, however, felt that this many clip shows would alienate fans of the series. The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode costs to produce, but they <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> syndication rights at full price.|$|E
5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. Too much then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend.

They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> its products and get returns.

5|$|Howe was {{determined}} to support technologically advanced industries, and saw no reason why Canada should not continue to produce aircraft after the war. His Director-General for Aircraft Production, Ralph Bell, disagreed with him, noting that Canada had no aircraft engine manufacturer, and that {{despite the presence of}} manufacturing plants and skilled workers, there was no guarantee that they <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> their products. Nevertheless, Howe took steps to keep aircraft manufacturers in business, allowing the British Hawker Siddeley Group to take over Victory Aircraft as A.V. Roe Canada (Avro Canada), while Canadair was sold to the US-based Electric Boat Company (later General Dynamics).|$|E
5|$|In August 1810, Tecumseh led 400 armed warriors {{down the}} Wabash River {{to meet with}} Harrison in Vincennes. As the warriors were dressed in war paint, their sudden {{appearance}} at first frightened the soldiers at Vincennes. The leaders of the group were escorted to Grouseland, where they met Harrison. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne Treaty was illegitimate. He argued that no one tribe <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> land without {{the approval of the}} other tribes; he asked Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Tecumseh informed Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its terms, and that his confederation of tribes was growing rapidly. Harrison said the Miami were the owners of the land and <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> it if they so chose. He rejected Tecumseh's claim that all the Indians formed one nation. He said each tribe could have separate relations with the United States if they chose to. Harrison argued that the Great Spirit would have made all the tribes speak one language if they were to be one nation.|$|E

On March 3, 1893, Congress duly passed an act authorising the souvenir coin, which was to be to the specifications of the quarter struck for circulation, and with a design to be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. Total mintage of the special quarter would be limited to 40,000 specimens.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} Kampoeng Rawa emerged in 2004, {{when a group}} of farmers and {{fishermen}} from the Rawa Pening area received a billion rupiah grant from the Artha Prima Credit Union.

In preparation for the 2013 Visit Jateng campaign, in 2011 they began planning a complex which would include culinary tourism and water activities. Artha Prima trained some locals as wait staff, cashiers, and security guards.|$|E
5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E
5|$|As the new decade began, KKR began {{restructuring}} RJR. In January 1990, it {{completed the}} sale of RJR's Del Monte Foods to a group led by Merrill Lynch. KKR had originally identified a group of divisions that it <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> to reduce debt. Over the coming years, RJR would pursue a number of additional restructurings, equity injections and public offerings of stock to provide the company with added financial flexibility. KKR contributed $1.7 billion of new equity into RJR in July 1990 to complete a restructuring of the company's balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders. KKR's equity contribution {{as part of the}} original leveraged buyout of RJR had been only $1.5 billion. In mid-December 1990, RJR announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in RJR for a new public stock in the company, effectively an unusual means of taking RJR public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company.|$|E

5|$|Spain forbade its American colonies {{to trade}} with other nations or foreign colonies, and imposed itself as the only buyer and vendor for their {{international}} trade. This situation damaged the viceroyalty, as Spain's economy was not powerful enough to produce the huge supply of goods that the numerous colonies would need. This caused economic shortages and recession. The Spanish trade routes favored the ports of Mexico and Lima, {{to the detriment of}} Buenos Aires. As a result, Buenos Aires smuggled those products that could not be obtained legitimately. Most local authorities allowed this smuggling as a lesser evil, even though it was illegal, and it occasionally equalled in volume the legal commerce with Spain. Two antagonistic factions emerged: the landowners wanted free trade so they <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> their products abroad, while the merchants, who benefited from the high prices of smuggled imports, opposed free trade because prices would come down.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} situation improved {{with the arrival}} of cattle in the colony. It is unknown when the first cattle arrived, but the division of land for the grazing of cattle in 1627 represented one of the first moves towards private land ownership in the colony. Cattle became an important source of wealth in the colony; the average cow <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> for £28 in 1638 (£ in 2010, or $ at PPP). However, the flood of immigrants during the Great Migration drove the price of cattle down. The same cows sold at £28 in 1638 were valued in 1640 at only £5 (£ in 2010, or $ at PPP). Besides cattle, there were also pigs, sheep, and goats raised in the colony.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exchange}} rate stability sustained by the Bretton Woods system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying design flaw, wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade. The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs. To accommodate these needs, the Bretton Woods system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar's value began exceeding its gold backing. During the early 1960s, investors <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in London than in the United States, signaling to market participants that the dollar was overvalued. Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin defined this problem {{now known as the}} Triffin dilemma, in which a country's national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world's reserve currency.|$|E

Traveling the world as an Armed Guard, he spent {{a year and a half}} at sea and the rest of the three years in San Francisco. Seeking to make money, and to follow his love for a girl, Beauchamp decided to attend Cranbrook Academy of Art from 1947-1948. There he studied pottery, believing one could [...] "make more money selling pots than you <b>could</b> <b>selling</b> paintings."

5|$|Industrialist Joseph Wharton had a near-monopoly on {{the mining}} of nickel in the United States, {{and sought to}} promote its use in coinage. He was also highly {{influential}} in Congress. His friends there, though they had failed to obtain the metal's use for the two-cent piece, had been more successful with the base-metal three-cent coin. Pollock prepared a bill authorizing a five-cent coin of the same alloy as the three-cent piece, with a total weight not to exceed 60 grains (3.9 g). At the committee stage in the House of Representatives, the weight was amended to , ostensibly to make the weight equal to five grams in the metric system but more likely so that Wharton <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> more nickel. This made the new coin heavy, in terms of weight per $.01 of face value, compared to the three-cent copper-nickel coin. The bill passed without debate on May 16, 1866. The new copper-nickel coin was legal tender for up to one dollar and would be paid out by the Treasury in exchange for coin of the United States, excluding the half cent, cent and two-cent. It was redeemable in lots of $100 for banknotes. Fractional currency in denominations of less than ten cents was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempt at}} repeal {{did not end}} the {{controversy}} over silver. Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri proposed {{a bill that would}} require the United States to buy as much silver as miners <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> the government and strike it into coins, a system that would increase the money supply and aid debtors. In short, silver miners would sell the government metal worth fifty to seventy cents, and receive back a silver dollar. Randall allowed the bill to come to the floor for an up-or-down vote during a special session in November 1877: the result was its passage by a vote of 163 to 34 (with 94 members absent). The pro-silver idea cut across party lines, and William B. Allison, a Republican from Iowa led the effort in the Senate. Allison offered an amendment in the Senate requiring the purchase of two to four million dollars per month of silver, but not allowing private deposit of silver at the mints. Thus, the seignorage, or difference between the face value of the coin and the worth of the metal contained within it accrued to the government's credit, not private citizens. President Hayes vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode the veto, and the Bland–Allison Act became law.|$|E
5|$|The {{mutilated}} body of {{the fourth}} woman, prostitute Annie Chapman, was discovered at about 6:00am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway {{in the back yard}} of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2am on the day she was murdered, with the intention of getting money from a client to pay her rent. Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8inches (15–20cm) long. However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they <b>could</b> <b>sell</b> as surgical specimens.|$|E
