40|$|The idea of {{regulating}} pollutions {{by means}} of tradable emission permits on a competitive market was developed {{for the first time}} by Dales in 1968. The question of the citizens’ participation on these markets received little attention in the economic literature. However, people are allowed to buy emission permits and can therefore reduce the level of pollution by removing them from the market. From a practical viewpoint, the citizen’s preferences are not taken into account neither in the elaboration nor in the functioning of pollution permits markets. However, such a situation does not comply with both the democratic values and the prevailing economic principles. This article aims to discuss the legitimacy of a participation of the citizens to a pollution permits market by introducing both the economic efficiency and the ethical dimension. As the problem of free riding is fundamental when the citizen participation takes place, we show that it can be partly solved by funding the citizen demand. In addition, it seems that the free riding behaviour is overestimated by theoretical economics as experimental economics applied to the game of the public good shows. In addition, the ethical stakes associated to the opening of the pollution markets permits to the citizens are analyzed. An ethics based on the freedom and the sovereignty of the citizens commands us to authorize the participation of the citizens to these markets. This point is finally discussed towards the <b>cumulative</b> <b>pollutions</b> and towards the intergenerational dimension of the equity. equity, altruism, public good, economic efficiency, ethics, tradable emission permits, citizen participation, intergenerational justice, free rider, <b>cumulative</b> <b>pollutions...</b>|$|R

The water stressed North stays {{in contrast to the}} water abundant and polluted South defining China's current water environment. In this paper we use the latest available data sets and adopt structural decomposition analysis for the years 1992 to 2007 to investigate the driving forces behind the emerging water crisis in China. We employ four water indicators in China, that is, freshwater consumption, discharge of COD (chemical oxygen demand) in effluent water, cumulative COD and dilution water requirements for <b>cumulative</b> <b>pollution,</b> to investigate the driving forces behind the emerging crisis. The paper finds water intensity improvements can effectively offset annual freshwater consumption and COD discharge driven by per capita GDP growth, but that it had failed to eliminate <b>cumulative</b> <b>pollution</b> in water bodies. Between 1992 and 2007, 225 million tonnes of COD accumulated in Chinese water bodies, which would require 3. 2 - 8. 5 trillion m 3 freshwater, depending on the water quality of the recipient water bodies to dilute pollution to a minimum reusable standard. Cumulative water pollution is a key driver to pollution induced water scarcity across China.

40|$|Environmental {{efficiency}} measures constructed {{using the}} materials balance principle have two important shortcomings: (1) the ambiguity {{in the treatment}} of immaterial inputs and the various types of energy and (2) the lack of universally accepted weights for various material inputs. These two limitations are primarily caused {{by the fact that the}} materials balance condition is strictly regulated by the law of mass/energy conservation and that mass/energy content cannot be a good physical common unit of various inputs. The use of cumulative exergy content overcomes these problems. The use of cumulative exergy content allows the inclusion of life cycle assessment; hence facilitates the analysis of the <b>cumulative</b> <b>pollution</b> and total affects on natural resources. The present study uses cumulative exergy content to construct new efficiency sustainable measures and decomposes them into technical efficiency and cumulative exergy allocative efficiency in agricultural production. Empirical applications on OECD agriculture yielded a number of important findings: (1) OECD has the potential to save 72. 3 % of cumulative exergy consumption and improvements can be achieved by being more technically efficient and choosing a better combination of inputs; (2) the sustainable efficiency varied enormously across countries; and (3) the efficiency levels in 2003 was lower than in 1990.

This study aimed {{to investigate the}} heavy metal pollutants of Yazd battery repairing workshops and to identify the ecological and environmental effects resulted. Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study {{was carried out in}} Yazd. In this regard, the city was divided into three parts on the basis of geographical features. Then, 30 workshops were selected from each part through stratified random sampling method. Heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn) in the floor were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The impacts assessment of heavy metals was evaluated using environmental potential risk index (RI), <b>cumulative</b> <b>pollution</b> index (IPI), pollution coefficient factor (Cf), and the degree of modified contamination (mCd) and Pearson’s correlation statistical test. Results: The trend of heavy metals concentrations in floor dust particles of workshops was as Fe>Cu>Pb>Zn>Mn>Cr>Cd. Therefore, the average concentrations of Fe and Cd in the samples were 27011. 52 ± 4721. 05 and 78. 25 ± 21. 07 mg/kg respectively. The results of the RI showed that heavy metal of floor dust had very high danger (2816. 29). The mCd value was as 63. 35 indicating these workshops were at severe contamination class. The value of Cf was as 304. 17 revealing that these workshops were at very severe contamination class. Conclusions: This research showed that the high concentration of heavy metals in battery repairing workshops is due to the interaction of heavy metals of industrial wastes components, including electrical wastes and battery with the dust having mankind origin...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the effects of oil spills on the environment, using the 2010 Gulf of Mexico event, which motivated the selection of this research topic, as a case study. It examines the spill from both a social and biological assessment in which policy, technology, and economics direct oil spill response and remediation. The dissertation is partly based on material collected during two years of fieldwork in Southern Louisiana. The Deepwater Horizon case study includes qualitative research grounded in a participatory action research (PAR) approach. The PAR strategy includes collective inquiry and experimentation through direct experience. Although historically the effort to mitigate the effects of the Deepwater Horizon spill was the greatest cleanup response to an oil spill, the effort only affected 24 % of the oil released in the Gulf. The fate of the remaining oil is unknown. Natural gas {{was not included in the}} spill discharge metric, nor will recovered oil (skimming and siphoning) be deducted from the fine that will be assessed on the responsible party, British Petroleum. Response strategies, such as the use of chemical dispersants and in-situ burning, did not remove oil, but instead contributed to the <b>cumulative</b> <b>pollution</b> in the environment. This case study revealed an opportunity to create legislation that motivates increased investment in technologies and response strategies that support the removal of the oil from the environment. Trough the Deepwater Horizon case study, I also explored alternative spill response technologies and approaches to remediation and restoration. More than a dozen alternative technologies were evaluated and adopted during the 87 -day oil spill event. The technologies evaluated included advancements for oil removal [...] skimming and shoreline cleanup. Furthermore, for the first time, an oiled marsh was set aside for the purpose of conducting applied oil remediation and restoration research. Through a multi-institutional collaboration, we designed and implemented a restoration project on set-aside marsh in Louisiana. This project abandoned the use of cultivars and instead embraced genetically diverse, locally adapted plants for shoreline restoration. Included in the marsh project was a plant propagation innovation which utilized composted bagasse, a waste product of the Louisiana sugar cane industry, as a growth medium. The bagasse adds valuable organic material to the oil-impacted marsh and proved to be a viable propagation medium for smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) plants. Additional soil remediation research, funded by the Chevron Corporation, investigated the use of vermiremediation for crude oil-impacted soils. Analysis of vermitea, the liquid extract from vermicompost, indicated the presence of biosurfactant producing hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, allowing for the increased solubility of hydrophobic compounds adsorbed to soil. Additional research and field-scale experiments are required to optimize vermiremediation and demonstrate the potential for scaling and adoption. My research supports the use of natural attenuation of oil-contaminated soil though the adoption of strategies which help to maintain the existing ecosystem. My research findings elucidate the critical limitations of current conventional oil spill response technologies and reveal the environmental tradeoffs that occur during response decision-making. The dissertation demonstrates the need for additional investment in technology innovation and for broader response strategies and preparation for future oil spills...|$|E

This hypothesis was examined by {{using data from the}} Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a population-based cohort aged 45 - 84 years, free of clinical cardiovascular disease, recruited from 6 US sites in 2000 - 2002. The MESA-Lung Study assessed a fractal, structural measure of early emphysema ("alpha," lower values indicate more emphysema) and a standard quantitative measure ("percent emphysema") from cardiac computed tomography scans. Childhood ETS exposure was assessed retrospectively as a report of living with one or more regular indoor smokers. Analyses included 1, 781 nonsmokers (< 100 cigarettes, 20 cigars, or 20 pipefulls in their lifetime and urinary cotinine levels < 100 ng/mL); mean age was 61 years (standard deviation, 10), and 65 % were women. Childhood ETS exposure from 2 or more smokers (17 %) compared with none (52 %) was associated with 0. 05 lower alpha and 2. 8 higher percent emphysema (P for trend = 0. 04 and 0. 01, respectively) after adjustment for demographic, anthropometric, parental, and participant characteristics, as well as adult exposures (e. g., <b>cumulative</b> residential air <b>pollution</b> exposure, exposure to ETS as an adult).

40|$|In {{the current}} economy, {{the cost of}} damage to the {{environment}} is often external, {{which is likely to}} lead to over-exploitation and inadequate provisioning. There are a variety of incentive-based schemes, such as effluent taxes or tradable permits, which attempt to confront the polluting agents with a ‘price’ equal to the marginal external cost of their activity. However, competitive incentives alone are not adequate for effective management of the shared resources. Thus, the current solutions exhibit several drawbacks including susceptibility to international free-riding, sensitivity to accurate estimation of cost of pollution or environmental targets, and inability to take the <b>cumulative</b> nature of <b>pollution</b> and its cost into account. This paper proposes an approach to eliminate the commons dilemma by using non-scalar numbers for the underlying economic signals. Rather than adding the cost of pollution to the cost of private resources, this cost is kept in a separate dimension represented by the second component of money and price. This separation enables us to develop more effective models for economic signals and incentives, and avoid the above-mentioned drawbacks. In the proposed design, the cost of <b>pollution</b> is <b>cumulative</b> and would have a progressively higher economic impact on both the competitive and cooperative incentives for managing pollution leading to a provable sustainable point. Moreover, the proposed model does not suffer from the free rider problem; does not require accurate estimation of the true cost of pollution; is simple to implement and backward compatible with the current economy...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{industrial}} development and urbanization processes {{that occurred in}} China over the past 30 years has increased dramatically the consumption {{of natural resources and}} raw materials, thus exacerbating the human pressure on environmental ecosystems. In result, large scale environmental pollution of soil, natural waters and urban air were recorded. The development of effective industrial planning to support regional sustainable economy development has become an issue of serious concern for local authorities which need to select safe sites for new industrial settlements (i. e. industrial plants) according to assessment approaches considering <b>cumulative</b> impacts, synergistic <b>pollution</b> effects and risks of accidental releases.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{perspective of}} agricultural sustainability involves the optimisation of monetary gains for farming businesses. These monetary objectives tend to drive farming businesses {{to conduct a}} production practice that is harmful {{to the environment and}} the sustained functioning of the ecosystem. In the long run the environment and ecosystem fails to support sustained plant and animal productivity growth. As a result there exists an urgent need to make agriculture more sustainable not only for farmers but also for the environment and ecosystem as a whole. This raises a need for measuring sustainability not only from the economic perspective but also from the environmental and ecological perspectives. The existing methods for measuring efficiency levels and productivity changes mainly deal with the economic considerations. Several models have proposed environmental efficiency and productivity change measures. However, they do not satisfy the first and second laws of thermodynamics which govern all production processes. This thesis proposes an analytical framework which accommodates the efficiency and productivity measurement from the three perspectives of economic, environment and ecological sustainability. This framework offers a number of models in which the contents of mass and exergy are utilised to construct environmental and ecological efficiency and productivity change measures. These newly proposed models satisfy the first and second laws of thermodynamics. In addition, the framework also decomposes changes in nutrient use efficiency, energy use efficiency, exergy use efficiency and cumulative exergy efficiency into various components of total factor productivity change and changes in aggregate nutrient, energy, exergy and cumulative exergy contents of inputs and outputs. In response to increasing efforts to assess the environmental and ecological performance of OECD countries in agriculture, this thesis applied the proposed models to measure the efficiency levels and productivity changes in these countries for years from 1990 to 2003. These empirical applications yielded several important findings. The first finding was that there were huge opportunities for OECD countries to make their agricultural production systems more sustainable environmentally and ecologically. On average, OECD countries should be able to produce their current output with an input vector that contains 57. 9 % less nitrogen and phosphorous and 68. 9 % less of cumulative exergy consumption without reducing the output levels. The saving in the consumption of nitrogen and phosphorous suggests that less potential eutrophication problems caused to the water systems by the nutrient balance. The reduction in the consumption of cumulative exergy implies that less extraction of the ecosystem services and resources and less amount of <b>cumulative</b> <b>pollution</b> sent to the ecosystem. The second important finding was that the potential improvements in terms of environmental and ecological sustainability can be achieved by being more technically efficient and even more significantly by changing input combinations. The results also confirmed that sustainability varied significantly across OECD countries and that environmental and ecological performance was also found to have connections with national production structures and the implementation of national agro-environmental policies. Further investigations are needed to explore these relationships. In terms of productivity, on average OECD countries had achieved an annual growth of one per cent. Moorsteen-Bjurek total factor productivity (TFP) growth was attributed by 1. 8 % growth in technological progress. Input-orientated technical, scale and residual mix efficiency levels, however, had declined over time. Annual growth rate in the nitrogen use efficiency estimated to be around 0. 9 % while the cumulative exergy transformity experienced a reduction at a yearly rate of 0. 1 per cent. The changes in these two indicators were driven by TFP growth but also counteracted by the changes of the aggregate nutrient contents and aggregate cumulative exergy contents ratios. The empirical applications have a few shortcomings which are mainly due {{to the use of the}} national aggregate data set of the OECD countries and data envelopment analysis (DEA) estimating technique. The proposed models, however, can deliver high potential uses for empirical studies in agricultural production. These shortcomings in the empirical studies can be dealt with effectively by using stochastic techniques to estimate frontiers of micro data sets...|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} {{of older}} adults to {{the health effects of}} air pollution is well-recognized. Advanced age may act as a partial surrogate for conditions associated with aging. The authors investigated whether gerontologic frailty (a clinical health status metric) modified the association between ambient level of ozone or particulate matter with an aerody-namic diameter less than 10 µm and lung function in 3, 382 older adults using 7 years of follow-up data (1990 – 1997) from the Cardiovascular Health Study and its Environmental Factors Ancillary Study. Monthly average pollution and annual frailty assessments were related to up to 3 repeated measurements of lung function using <b>cumulative</b> summa-ries of <b>pollution</b> and frailty histories that accounted for duration as well as concentration. Frailty history was found to modify long-term associations of pollutants with forced vital capacity. For example, the decrease in forced vital capac-ity associated with a 70 -ppb/month greater cumulative sum of monthly average ozone exposure was 12. 3 mL (95 % confidence interval: 10. 4, 14. 2) for a woman who had spent the prior 7 years prefrail or frail as compared with 4. 7 mL (95 % confidence interval: 3. 8, 5. 6) for a similar woman who was robust during all 7 years (interaction P < 0. 001). aging; effect modifier, epidemiologic; environmental exposure; frail elderly; respiratory function tests Abbreviations: CHS, Cardiovascular Health Study; CI, confidence interval; FEV 1, forced expiratory volume in 1 second; FVC, forced vital capacity; PFT, pulmonary function test; PM 2. 5, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2. 5 µm; PM 10, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 µm...|$|R
