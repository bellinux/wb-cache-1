50|$|While handcrafting guitars {{is still}} a popular method of guitar {{manufacturing}} for luthiers and large manufacturer custom shops, the {{major players in the}} guitar industry are shifting to computer controlled mass production of guitars. This approach maintains the quality of their instruments while increasing efficiency and productivity.Most manufacturers use some form of geometric modeling and CNC machining software when designing a guitar. A common choice of a CAD (<b>Computer</b> <b>Aided</b> <b>Design)</b> <b>system</b> is Solidworks, which is utilized by Taylor Guitars. With a CAD system, a two-dimensional or three-dimensional model of the guitar can be designed and seen before a physical model is created. This allows for consistency and convenience in the design process, whether the guitar is made out of wood, metal, polymer, or any machinable substance. For a guitar made out of aluminum, for example, the top, sides, and back of the body are drawn in a modeling program and a 3D model can be created by combining these 2D features. This representation gives the ability to see the final product before any material is cut.|$|E

40|$|Commercial Computer-Aided Design {{systems have}} mainly focused {{to support the}} process of {{capturing}} and representing geometric shapes and incorporating technological information. In contrast, few utilities in these systems are present to facilitate decision making {{in the early stages}} of the design process, such as the capture, modeling and conceptual design synthesis of solutions. Typical tasks of the conceptual design process in mechanical design are lead in applications stand-alone or are based on the heuristic knowledge of the designer. Such approaches are non-interoperable with de commercial computer-aided design systems, leading to discontinuous design information of design process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a scheme, that can be used to support the {{communication}} process in cooperative <b>design.</b> Computational <b>aids</b> for <b>design</b> have largely been for a designerworking by himself/herself. These aids have also been supplemented by the widespread use of artificial intelligence approaches. However, design is so complex, and very rarely acted upon by a single designer but many more working towards the same aim. This involves a new paradigm in which designers need to cooperate with each other using a computational medium. A protocol analysis in cooperative design has been carried out and technological support has been proposed. Cooperative design becomes an important paradigm for the next generation of intelligent <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> <b>design</b> <b>systems.</b> It will be conducted in many forms among several designers and willrequire the support of advanced communication facilities beyond the “passivei transmission of data and messages. Technological advances in communication networks have opened up new ways for cooperative design interaction across several processes of cooperation among designers, designers and <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> <b>design</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> <b>design</b> <b>systems</b> and knowledge based systems, and knowledge based systems themselves. In cooperative design environments, aunit of communication among designers is the transfer of a message from one designer (a sender) to another (a receiver). The aim of such communication is to provide the receiver with some information or to have the receiver take certain actions. Inspired by the speech act theory, a branch of the philosophy of language and linguistics, such a unit is called a communicative act. By analogy to architectural design, a communicative act is a performing act in designers communication...|$|R
