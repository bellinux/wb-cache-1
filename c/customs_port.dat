2500|$|Throughout {{this time}} the port of Runcorn {{remained}} part of the port of Liverpool. [...] Towards {{the middle of the}} 19th century the port was becoming more important and this was recognised on 5 April 1847 when it was designated as an independent <b>customs</b> <b>port.</b> [...] Its boundary extended {{on both sides of the}} Mersey from Warrington Bridge in the east to a point on a line stretching from Eastham church in Cheshire to Chapel Farm House in Lancashire. [...] It included the waters of the River Weaver up to Frodsham Bridge. [...] It included, on the north bank of the Mersey, Widnes Dock, the first purpose-built railway dock in the world. [...] A more dignified customs house was built to mark the event. [...] However Runcorn's status as an independent <b>customs</b> <b>port</b> was not a success. [...] Few large ships were registered in the port or transferred from the Liverpool register and on 12 April 1850 it became part of the Port of Liverpool again. [...] However the port's prospects improved at this time with the abolition of the Navigation Acts (which had restricted the use of foreign shipping), and an increasing number of foreign vessels began to arrive at the docks. [...] Trade increased so much that the Bridgewater Trustees were having difficulty in coping with the increased trade. [...] In 1853 an act promoted by the Earl of Ellesmere led to the construction of a short canal, the Runcorn and Weston Canal, which connected the Francis Dock to the Weston Canal. [...] This was opened for traffic on 25 February 1860. [...] At {{this time the}} Runcorn docks were coming under increasing competition from the railways, especially from the St Helens Canal and Railway Company who opened Garston Dock downstream on the north bank of the Mersey.|$|E
2500|$|Runcorn was {{appointed}} again {{as an independent}} <b>customs</b> <b>port</b> on 1 January 1862. [...] In 1860 the Bridgewater Trustees had opened the Alfred Dock, which was fitted with hydraulic cranes. [...] In 1862 a telegraph line was installed which linked the dock with the Bridgewater Trustees' offices in Manchester and their dock in Liverpool. [...] From around {{this time there was}} a considerable increase in trade; in April of that year over 110 vessels entered the port, which was more than could be conveniently accommodated. [...] In order to deal with the increased trade the Bridgewater Trustees began to build a new dock in 1867 and to remove obstructions from the river. [...] The new dock was the Arnold Dock and this was opened in 1870. [...] Before the repeal of the Navigation Acts most of the trade had been coastal; there now came a considerable increase in foreign trade. [...] In 1845 foreign trade had been virtually nothing; in 1871 the export trade amounted to 43,000 tons and the imports more than 30,000. [...] Matters were not as successful with the Mersey and Irwell business because there had been no major dock improvements since 1829 and the approach channels were silting up. [...] On the north bank of the Mersey, West Bank Dock at Widnes was busy especially with importing raw materials and exporting chemicals and fertilisers. [...] The other major materials passing through the port were raw cotton, potter's clay, salt, coal and soap.|$|E

2500|$|From about 1877 the silting of the {{channels}} started {{to improve and}} trade improved again. The improvement continued until 1889 when {{the construction of the}} Manchester Ship Canal caused problems. [...] Trade declined again and in 1894 the independent <b>customs</b> <b>Port</b> of Runcorn was abolished being incorporated in the Port of Manchester. [...] Construction of the ship canal began in November 1877. [...] On 3 August 1887 the Manchester Ship Canal Company had purchased the Bridgewater Navigation Company for £1,710,000, thus acquiring the Bridgewater Canal and its docks and the Mersey and Irwell system. [...] The ship canal allowed large ocean-going ships to travel to the Port of Runcorn. [...] The canal was completed from Eastham to Weston Point by 1892 and in July of that year a temporary port, called Saltport, was established {{at the mouth of the}} River Weaver. [...] By 1893 the ship canal was opened as far as the Old Quay Dock. [...] In order to allow direct access to the Port of Runcorn and the Weaver Navigation four locks were built. [...] Weston Marsh lock at the mouth of the Weaver allowed access to the Weaver Navigation, Weston Mersey lock enabled entrance to the Weaver Docks, the Bridgewater docks were served by the Bridgewater lock and the Old Quay dock by the Runcorn Old Quay lock. [...] The ship canal was opened throughout its length in 1894. [...] Saltport was bypassed and a few years later it was dismantled. [...] To the east of the Bridgewater Dock the ship canal passes under Runcorn Railway Bridge which has a clearance of [...] above the high water mark of the Mersey. [...] This meant that the larger of the tall ships could not pass under the bridge. [...] A lay-by was therefore built for these ships to discharge their cargo, which was carried onwards by a lighter to its destination. [...] The lay-by was big enough to accommodate the largest merchant vessels of the day. [...] While the larger vessels approached the Runcorn docks by way of the ship canal, the smaller vessels sailed up the Mersey and entered the docks through the locks.|$|E
