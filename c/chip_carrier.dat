25|$|The 80286 was {{designed}} for multi-user systems with multitasking applications, including communications (such as automated PBXs) and real-time process control. It had 134,000 transistors and consisted of four independent units: address unit, bus unit, instruction unit and execution unit, organized into a loosely coupled (buffered) pipeline {{just as in the}} 8086. The significantly increased performance over the 8086 was primarily due to the non-multiplexed address and data buses, more address-calculation hardware (most importantly, a dedicated adder) and a faster (more hardware-based) multiplier. It was produced in a 68-pin package, including PLCC (plastic leaded <b>chip</b> <b>carrier),</b> LCC (leadless <b>chip</b> <b>carrier)</b> and PGA (pin grid array) packages.|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} designs, {{the core of}} the Cray-3 consisted of a number of modules, each containing several circuit boards packed with parts. In order to increase density, the individual GaAs chips were not packaged, and instead several were mounted directly with ultrasonic gold bonding to a board approximately [...] square. The boards were then turned over and mated to a second board carrying the electrical wiring, with wires on this card running through holes to the [...] "bottom" [...] (opposite the chips) side of the <b>chip</b> <b>carrier</b> where they were bonded, hence sandwiching the chip between the two layers of board. [...] These submodules were then stacked four-deep and, as in the Cray-2, wired to each other to make a 3D circuit.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 A {{numerical}} {{technique to}} compute the time domain response of multiconductor lossy uniform and nonuniform lines terminated in general nonlinear elements is presented. The technique {{is based on the}} generalized method of characteristics. The method transforms the original system of transmission line equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. The differentials are then approximated by finite differences and solved numerically. The technique is used to study signal delay, distortion and crosstalk in interconnections in integrated circuits and <b>chip</b> <b>carriers.</b> Typical examples illustrating the time domain response of uniform and nonuniform multiconductor lines representing integrated circuit interconnections on <b>chips,</b> <b>chip</b> <b>carriers</b> and packaging are included...|$|R
50|$|The CuW75 composite, with 75% tungsten, {{is widely}} used in <b>chip</b> <b>carriers,</b> substrates, flanges, and frames for power {{semiconductor}} devices. The high thermal conductivity of copper together with the low thermal expansion of tungsten allows thermal expansion matching to silicon, gallium arsenide, and some ceramics. Other materials for this applications are CuMo alloy, AlSiC, and Dymalloy.|$|R
50|$|Both lead-tin and silver-tin {{material}} can be soldered. Process recipes will differ {{depending on the}} alloy composition. For soldering 44-pin <b>chip</b> <b>carriers</b> to a board using soldering preforms, power levels were {{on the order of}} 10 Watts and solder times approximately 1 second. Low power levels can lead to incomplete wetting and the formation of voids, both of which can weaken the joint.|$|R

50|$|In {{the context}} of {{manufacturing}} integrated circuits, wafer dicing is {{the process by which}} die are separated from a wafer of semiconductor following the processing of the wafer. The dicing process can involve scribing and breaking, mechanical sawing (normally with a machine called a dicing saw) or laser cutting. All methods are typically automated to ensure precision and accuracy.Following the dicing process the individual silicon chips are encapsulated into <b>chip</b> <b>carriers</b> which are then suitable for use in building electronic devices such as computers, etc.|$|R
50|$|Compaction {{of ceramic}} powders is a {{specific}} forming technique for ceramics. It is {{a process in which}} ceramic granular materials are made cohesive through mechanical densification, involving (hot pressing) or not (cold forming) temperature exposition.The process permits an efficient production of parts ranging widely in size and shape to close tolerances with low drying shrinkage. Traditional (for instance: ceramic tiles, porcelain products) and structural (for instance: <b>chip</b> <b>carriers,</b> spark plugs, cutting tools) ceramics are produced.Cold compaction of ceramic powders ends up with the realization of the so-called green piece, which is later subject to sintering.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to formulate the pulverized electronic waste (PEW) stream derived from grinding obsolete electronic assemblies and combine this material with thermoplastic or thermosetting polymers into useful, high-value commercial products materials. PEW consists primarily of various thermoset plastic materials and glass fibers from the printed wiring boards, along with ceramic pieces from <b>chip</b> <b>carriers</b> and other electronic components. Typically, the thermosetting materials have the same desirable properties as in the original electronic assembly, including relatively high temperature resistance, excellent chemical resistance, and flame retardancy. These properties combine to make PEW an inherently good inert filler material for plastic composites...|$|R

50|$|Processor {{design is}} the design {{engineering}} task {{of creating a}} microprocessor, a component of computer hardware. It is a subfield of electronics engineering and computer engineering. The design process involves choosing an instruction set and a certain execution paradigm (e.g. VLIW or RISC) and results in a microarchitecture described in e.g. VHDL or Verilog. This description is then manufactured employing some of the various semiconductor device fabrication processes. This results in a die which is bonded onto a <b>chip</b> <b>carrier.</b> This <b>chip</b> <b>carrier</b> is then soldered onto, or inserted into a socket on, {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB).|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} “evaporation∕melt and blow” {{mechanism of}} CO 2 laser cutting of aluminum nitride (AlN) <b>chip</b> <b>carriers</b> and heat sinks suffers from energy losses {{due to its}} high thermal conductivity, formation of dross, decomposition to aluminum, and uncontrolled thermal cracking. In order to overcome these limitations, a thermochemical method that uses a defocused laser beam to melt {{a thin layer of}} AlN surface in oxygen environment was utilized. Subsequent solidification of the melt layer generated shrinkage and thermal gradient stresses that, in turn, created a crack along the middle path of laser beam and caused material separation through unstable crack propagation. The benefits associated with thermal stress fracture method over the traditional method are improved cut quality, higher cutting speed, and lower energy losses...|$|R

Prototype hybrid test vehicles have been developed at Sandia National Laboratories to evaluate three lead-free solders for Au-Pt-Pd thick film soldering. The alloys are based on the Sn-Ag, Sn-Ag-Bi and Sn-Ag-Bi-Au systems. Populated test vehicles with surface mount devices were designed and fabricated to evaluate actual solder joints. Pastes were screen printed on the test substrates and reflowed with the components in place.

We {{recognize that this}} temperature range far exceeds most testing of assemblies. The purposes of these tests were to evaluate worst-case conditions and to obtain comparative information. Identical PWB assemblies, using these three component types, were subjected to both thermal shock testing (1 cycle every 42 minutes) and temperature cycle testing (1 cycle every 3 hours). The double testing {{evaluated the}} differences in stress application and evaluated the potential of replacing slow transition, expensive temperature cycle testing (which has been an industry standard for years) with the much more rapid thermal shock testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of soldered joints in purposively faulty mounted electronic components {{has been studied}} {{in order to determine}} the acceptable dislocation tolerance and to diminish efforts for refinishing operations. As the electronic components plastic leaded <b>chip</b> <b>carriers,</b> the PLCC 84 with daisy chain internal wiring were chosen and subjected to temperature change cycles. After different numbers of load cycles the joints were electrically tested and the faailure rate compared with the visually evaluated dislocation. In addition, damages and cracks were characterized by REM and metallographic investigations. It is demonstrated that failures by breakage of the soldered joints can be excluded at x- and y-dislocations up to 50 %.
