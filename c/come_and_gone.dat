5|$|It {{originally}} {{started as}} a massive loop around the Chicago area, however it has retained its current, much shorter route ever since 1937. During the 1990s, it {{became the subject of}} much concern for local residents regarding expansion which slowed down any progress for capacity improvement. By the late 2000s, the delays have <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> and it has emerged as a state route that has been largely modernized to deal with heavy traffic.|$|E
5|$|Aang {{proposes a}} beach party {{in lieu of}} training, {{explaining}} that he has decided to challenge Fire Lord Ozai only after Sozin's Comet and its enhancement of firebending have <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone,</b> due to his self-perceived inability to fight the Fire Lord on equal footing. When Zuko tells the group that Ozai {{plans to use the}} comet's power to burn down the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribes, Aang resolves to face him before the comet arrives. Sokka decides to have a simulation fight against a scarecrow, but Aang refuses to kill it due to his pacifistic nature and non-violent upbringing, and even berates his friends after they tell pointedly him that he {{has no choice but to}} kill Ozai.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, {{science fiction}} (sf) {{magazines}} {{had been published}} successfully in North America for over twenty years, but little progress {{had been made in}} establishing British equivalents. The bulk of British sf was published as paperback books, rather than magazines; a situation opposite of that in the US. Several short-lived magazines had <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone,</b> {{both before and after the}} war. John Spencer launched four very poor quality juvenile magazines in 1950, which continued into the mid-1950s, while one magazine, New Worlds, had survived since 1946. Since 1939, Atlas, a British publisher, had been producing a reprint edition of Astounding Science Fiction, one of the most well-regarded American sf magazines. During the war the contents had often been cut severely, and the schedule had not been regular, but it was reputed to sell 40,000 copies a month. This was enough to attract the attention of Hamilton & Co., a British publisher looking for new markets.|$|E

25|$|Millions {{of dollars}} were spent {{replacing}} the old terminal, which hosted a half-dozen airlines before its demolition. In the mid 1980s and early 1990s, major carriers, such as Piedmont, Northwest Airlines, Continental, and USAir all flew mainline jets into Worcester. In addition, smaller carriers, like New York Air and Presidential Airways also had jet service. The small terminal had two ground level jetways built {{to accommodate the}} growth. But one by one, those carriers left. A succession of second-tier air carriers have <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> over the last decade.|$|E
25|$|The city of Allentown, Pennsylvania was {{established}} in 1762 {{and is one of}} the oldest major cities in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States. It has deep roots in the history of the nation, being the hiding place of the Liberty Bell during the American Revolution, and its oldest city cemetery has graves of soldiers who served in the Continental Army. Over its 250-year history of the city numerous buildings, bridges, parks and other locations in the city have <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone,</b> but many remain, with no less than thirteen of them being on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|Some {{schools have}} <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone,</b> {{and some have}} offshoots (such as the Mei'an school, a Zhucheng school offshoot). Often, the school is {{originated}} from a single person, such as the Wu school which is named after the late Wu Zhaoji. The style can vary considerably between schools; some are very similar, yet others are very distinct. The differences are often in interpretation of the music. Northern schools {{tend to be more}} vigorous in technique than Southern schools. But in modern terms, the distinction between schools and styles is often blurred because a single player may learn from many different players from different schools and absorb each of their styles. This is especially so for conservatory trained players. People from the same school trained under the same master may have different individual styles (such as Zhang Ziqian and Liu Shaochun of the Guangling school).|$|E

25|$|The British Rallycross Grand Prix has <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> {{in recent}} years, {{but none of}} the modern incarnations have come close to the 'real' Grand Prix, the {{versions}} of the event run at Brands Hatch between 1982 and 1994. The Rallycross Grand Prix was, in essence, an open-house, end of season, free for all. If you had a Rallycross car and fancied racing in the Grand Prix, you could make your entry and have a go. This led to some wonderful events and the chance to see unusual cars and star drivers; Denis Marcel's beautiful Matra Murena, unlikely and surprisingly fast NSUs from Norway, Stig Blomqvist wheeling out his privately owned Audi Quattro, sportscar ace Cor Euser doing a great job in a MG Metro 6R4, etc. The Grand Prix was different; it stood out from the crowd and appealed to competitors because it wasn’t just another event. Being Brands Hatch helped, geographically it was good and the circuit put all of its marketing and PR effort into making something of the event.|$|E
25|$|Often, {{archaeology}} {{provides the}} only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> of which {{there is little or}} no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, Homo sapiens has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of Homo for millions of years (see Human evolution). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization – the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities – must come from archaeology.|$|E
25|$|In 2002–03, Southampton {{finished}} {{eighth in}} the league and finished runners-up in the FA Cup to Arsenal (after losing 1–0 at the Millennium Stadium), thanks in no small part to the metamorphosis of James Beattie, who fired home 24 goals, 23 in the league. Strachan resigned in March 2004 and within eight months, two different managers – Paul Sturrock and Steve Wigley – had <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone.</b> Chairman Rupert Lowe risked the ire of Saints fans when he appointed Harry Redknapp as manager on 8 December 2004, just after his resignation at South Coast rivals Portsmouth. He brought in a number of new signings, including his son Jamie in the attempt to survive relegation. Southampton were relegated from the Premier League {{on the last day of}} the season, ending 27 successive seasons of top flight football for the club. Their relegation was ironically confirmed by a 2–1 home defeat to Manchester United, who had been on the receiving end of many upsets by Southampton over the years, namely in the 1976 FA Cup final and since then on a number of occasions in the league, as well as inflicting a heavy defeat on them in a November 1986 League Cup tie which cost United manager Ron Atkinson his job.|$|E
