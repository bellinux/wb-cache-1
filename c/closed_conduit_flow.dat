40|$|Criterion {{have been}} {{developed}} for designing a stilling basin to serve as a transition from <b>closed</b> <b>conduit</b> <b>flow</b> to open channel flow for a fully submerged pipe outlet. The unique feature of the stilling basin is the short-pipe energy dissipater so located and designed as to provide maximum energy dissipation for the basin configuration. The expanding characteristics of a submerged jet were used in establishing the length of the stilling basin. The unsteadiness of the water surface and the relative boil height in the model basin were used as the criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the structure for energy dissipation. Relations between the tailwater depth, the outlet flume floor elevation, and the height of boils in the stilling basin, the width of the stilling basin, and the amount of freeboard have been studied. The interrelationships among these variables have been shown graphically...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEarlier {{investigators}} have numerically carried out performance {{analysis of the}} invert trap fitted in an open channel using the stochastic discrete phase model (DPM) by assuming the open channel flow to be <b>closed</b> <b>conduit</b> <b>flow</b> under pressure and assuming zero shear stress at the top wall. This {{is known as the}} fixed lid model. By assuming the top wall to be a shear free wall, {{they have been able to}} show that the velocity distribution looks similar to that of an open channel flow with zero velocity at the bottom and maximum velocity at the top, representing the free water surface, but no information has been provided for the pressure at the free water surface. Because of this assumption, the validation of the model in predicting the trap efficiency has performed significantly poorly. In addition, the free water surface subject to zero gauge pressure cannot be modeled using the fixed lid model because there is no provision of extra space in the form of air space for the fluctuating part of the water surface profile. It can, however, be modeled using the volume of fluid (VOF) model because the VOF model is the appropriate model for open channel or free surface flow. Therefore, in the present study, three-dimensional (3 D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling with the VOF model, which considers open channel flow with a free water surface, along with the stochastic DPM, was used to model the trap efficiency of an invert trap fitted in an open rectangular channel. The governing mathematical flow equations of the VOF model were solved using the ANSYS Fluent 14. 0 software, reproducing the experimental conditions exactly. The results show that the 3 D CFD predictions using the VOF model closely fit the experimental data for glass bead particles...|$|E

These effects include loss of conveyance, surging caused by air compression, loss of storage, and geysering. The capability to monitor the formation and motion of entrapped air pockets is highly desirable when modeling extreme rain events in stormwater systems. Experimental investigations conducted at Auburn University have led {{to a better understanding of}} important flow features related to the mo-tion of entrapped air in <b>closed</b> <b>conduit</b> <b>flows.</b> Results from these studies, which are summarized in this work, have supported the development of an innovative approach to perform simulations of the air pocket motion based on Benjamin’s (1968) work on air cavity motion. The proposed model accounts for surface tension in a similar manner to Wilkinson (1982) but incorporates back-ground flows and circular cross-sections. Air motion is described with a non-Boussinesq integral gravity current model approach, assuming a steady state flow for the water. Measured and predicted values for the air pocket leading edge coordinate and celerity are compared.

40|$|AbstractThe Manning’s {{equation}} {{is commonly used}} to calculate discharge and mean velocity of the uniform flows. According to experimental data, Manning’s equation with constant Manning’s coefficient overestimates the discharge of second-kind channels (channels with a closing top-width), under the partially full flow. This problem can be solved by altering the Manning’s coefficient depending on the relative flow depth or changing {{the definition of the}} conventional hydraulic radius, that is, flow area divided by the wetted perimeter. Since, Manning’s coefficient theoretically depends only on the materials of the wall, so it seems that the second method is preferable. In current research a new and improved definition of hydraulic radius for <b>closed</b> <b>conduits</b> <b>flowing</b> partially full, is presented.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, {{some aspects of}} {{dividing}} and combining flows are studied. The {{first part of the}} study considers the discharge characteristics of flow past a two-dimensional lateral slot located in a rectangular conduit. Existing theoretical solutions to this problem are based on free streamline theory. The test results provide data to verify the predictions of the theoretical model related to the dependence of the slot discharge coefficient on discharge ratios and the ratio of the kinetic energy to the total energy of the flow approaching the slot. The test results validate the model predictions. A theoretical expression for the outflow through a rectangular lateral weir located in a circular open channel is derived. The theoretical weir discharge coefficient is expressed {{as a function of the}} parameters relating the geometry of the weir and the channel, and a velocity parameter that is a function of the dimensionless flow depth, the weir sill height and the approach Froude number. Experimental results are presented to verify the proposed theoretical model. The characteristics of dividing <b>flows</b> in <b>closed</b> rectangular <b>conduits</b> are studied in the next section. The contraction coefficient and the loss coefficients of branching flows are determined using results of an existing model dealing with a two-dimensional lateral outlet fitted with an external barrier. For dividing <b>closed</b> <b>conduit</b> <b>flows,</b> two different procedures are used to obtain the variation of an energy loss coefficient and the contraction coefficient with the discharge ratio. Detailed velocity and pressure distribution profiles are presented to describe the flow processes. In the final part of the thesis, the characteristics of combining flows past 90 ∘ junctions of a rectangular <b>closed</b> <b>conduit</b> are presented. Detailed pressure and velocity distribution data are obtained to understand the flow processes. Both the mean and fluctuating components of the velocity field are determined in the two flow sections immediately downstream of the junction.

40|$|While {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} {{research}} on air entrainment at hydraulic jumps within <b>closed</b> <b>conduits,</b> very little of the research has specifically addressed size and temperature scale effects. Influences from jump location and changing length characteristics on air entrainment have also received little attention from past research. To determine the significance of size-scale effects of air entrained by hydraulic jumps in <b>closed</b> <b>conduits,</b> air <b>flow</b> measurements were taken in four different-sized circular pipe models with similar Froude numbers. Each of the pipe models sloped downward and created identical flow conditions that differed only in size. Additionally, specific measurements were taken in one of the pipe models with various water temperatures to identify any effects from changing fluid properties. To determine the significance of the effects of changed length characteristics on air demand, air flow measurements were taken with hydraulic jumps at multiple locations within a circular pipe with two different air release configurations at the end of the pipe. Results showed that air demand was not affected by the size of the model. All together, the data from four different pipe models show that size-scale effects of air entrained into hydraulic jumps within <b>closed</b> <b>conduits</b> are negligible. However, it was determined that air entrainment was significantly affected by the water temperature. Water at higher temperatures entrained much less air than water at lower temperatures. Hydraulic jump location results showed that for both configurations the percentage of air entrainment significantly increased as the hydraulic jump occurred near the point of air release downstream. As the jump occurred nearer to the end of the pipe, its length characteristics were shortened and air demand increased. However, jump location was only a significant factor until the jump occurred some distance upstream where the length characteristics were not affected. Upstream of this location the air demand was dependent only on the Froude number immediately upstream of the jump...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent {{boundary}} layers over flat {{walls in}} the presence of a hill are frequently found in nature and industry. Some examples are the air flows over hills and desert dunes, but also water flows over aquatic dunes inside <b>closed</b> <b>conduits.</b> The perturbation of a two-dimensional boundary layer by a hill introduces new scales in the problem, changing the way in which velocities and stresses are distributed along the flow. When {{in the presence of}} sediment transport, the stress distribution along the hill is strongly related to bed instabilities. This paper presents an experimental study on the perturbation of a fully-developed turbulent boundary layer by a two-dimensional hill.

The work was accelerated in 2007 because of increased funding from the State of Minnesota’s Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund.

Persistent lava lakes require a constant influx of heat to sustain a molten state at the Earth's surface. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how such heat transfer can operate efficiently. These models make contrasting predictions {{with respect to the}} flow dynamics in volcanic conduits and should result in dissimilar volatile emissions at the surface. Here we look at high-frequency SO 2 fluxes, plume composition, thermal emissions and aerial video footage from the Villarrica lava lake {{in order to determine the}} mechanism sustaining its activity. We found that while fluctuations are apparent in all datasets, none shows a stable periodic behaviour. These observations suggest a continuous influx of volatiles and magma to the Villarrica lava lake. We suggest that ascending volatile-rich and descending degassed magmas are efficiently mixed within the volcanic conduit, resulting in no clear periodic oscillations in the plume composition and flux. We compare our findings to those of other lava lakes where equivalent gas emission time-series have been acquired, and suggest that gas flux, magma viscosity and conduit geometry are key parameters determining which flow mechanism operates in a given volcanic conduit.

A 1 D two-phase non-homogeneous Eulerian-Eulerian model has been developed for checking the influence of some crucial quantities: interphase drag, particle-wall friction and particle shape factor.

The parameter combination that best fits the whole set of experiments, including both column collapses and convective plumes, results into an average error of about 10 %. A further analysis has been carried out to determine the sensitivity of solutions to model parameters. The choice of the interphase drag does not influence dramatically the solution, except for highly concentrated flows. The particle shape factor severely affects gas and particle velocities.

40|$|It {{is evident}} that studies on {{colloidal}} stability {{have been a major}} subject of interest among researchers both in academia and industry. Thus the present research was directed towards understanding mechanisms that govern colloidal stability, exploring viable, scalable and environmentally ‗greener‘ techniques to improve the stability based on existing and innovative approaches and ultimately paving routes for applying the concept into real engineering applications. Three major topics were pursued within the current research perspective. The first topic emphasized on the exploration of surfactant free stabilization technique to improve the stability of aggregated prone structure in colloidal system. To achieve this objective several unconventional routes have been adopted based on different strategies. The first approach involved incorporation of highly charged nanoparticles which interact with the weakly charged aggregated colloidal systems to prolong and enhance their overall stability. Series of experimental results strongly suggested the improvement of weakly charged colloidal stability in the studied bimodal system. The subsequent part of the research concerned with the use of Graphene Oxide (GO) nanosheets as a new class of stabilizer for different carbon allotropes. Two additional carbonous materials under the family of fullerene (Carbon Nanofibers- CNFs) and graphite (Graphene Nanoplatelets - GnPs) were introduced within the present study on top of the commonly investigated GO-Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) hybrid. The results elucidated the ability of GO to segregate the above carbon allotropes to yield much dispersed colloidal suspension. Further, investigation was conducted on the use of GO to improve the solubility of weakly charged GnP. The results showed that GO was capable of stabilizing GnP colloid near its isoelectric point to prevent rapid agglomeration and sedimentation. The research continued with the use of plant based phytochemical extract on the dissolution of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) bundles in aqueous based solution. The results led to the fact that type, concentration and molecular structure of phytochemicals affect the level of CNT stability. Improvement in thermal conductivity measurements along with negligible increase in viscosity were recorded by using the above approach. The second topic focused on the benign and facile preparation of highly stable Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO) and its role on enhancing the thermophysical properties of heat transfer liquid. GO was prepared and subsequently reduced by using Tannic Acid which served as natural based environmentally benign reducing agent. Further, a meticulous amount of different high purity carbon sources (i. e., Carbon Nanotube-CNT, Carbon Nanofiber-CNF and Graphene Nanoplatelets-GnP) were introduced to the RGO sheets to form series of hybrid complexes. The results obtained showed that GO was successfully reduced based on the material characterization evidences. Moreover, the addition of highly conjugated carbon structures on RGO has proven to promote highly efficient thermal transport with minimal penalty on viscosity increment. The final topic dealt with the field testing of various colloidal mixtures with improved stability within energy transport system. This topic was divided into three specific studies. The first study involved the use of RGO and its hybrid complexes to improve the convective heat transfer performance in <b>close</b> <b>conduit</b> configuration. A <b>close</b> loop pipe flow experimental set-up working in turbulent mode and subjected to constant heat flux was established. It was discovered that the results obtained closely coincide to the previous documented findings on heat transfer enhancement related to the addition of graphene based materials. Studies on hydrodynamic parameters indicated negligible increase in pressure loss as well as friction factor for RGO and its hybrid mixtures. The second study highlighted on the numerical study on the effect of implementing temperature dependent thermopysical properties, constant mean velocity as well as fully developed inlet boundary condition for velocity and turbulent parameters in heat transfer performance of nanofluid <b>closed</b> <b>conduit</b> turbulent <b>flow.</b> The investigation was conducted in a 2 -D pipe flow model. TiO 2 based nanofluid was selected as colloidal medium within the present study. Series of results confirmed the effectiveness of incorporating the above features on gaining much realistic representation of heat transfer behavior. The final part of the topic involved a comparative assessment between experimental and numerical approaches on convective heat transfer in <b>close</b> <b>conduit</b> by using RGO-based colloid. A computational domain resembling the previously constructed experimental test section was established. The results showed that the surface temperature along the axial parameter of the pipe remained relatively close between the two approaches. Further, the numerical heat transfer property was found to move closer toward experimental results at the downstream section of the conduit, suggesting the ability of single phase simulation strategy to capture the nature of heat transfer within the thermally and hydrodynamically developed regions.

40|$|A hydrological-hydraulic quasi- 2 D {{multilayer}} {{simulation model}} is presented. It models the dominant hydrological {{processes involved in}} the rainfall-runoff transformation in rural and urban environments. The modeling structure {{is based on the}} well-known schemes of intercon-nected cells, with the original addition of a large set of linking laws. These allow flow simulation in both surface runoff and networks of <b>closed</b> <b>conduits.</b> The model was developed to embrace different scales of rural and urban storm drainage from streets to river basins, and to cover different levels of detail, from river basins with a resolution of 0. 10 elements/km 2 to drainage micro basins with 600 elements/km 2. The conceptual model and a synthesis of several relevant applications are presented here. The results obtained were satisfactory, and show that the real process of rainfall-runoff transformation flowing in a single layer and in two interconnected layers (surface runoff and networks of <b>closed</b> <b>conduits)</b> can be successfully modeled...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} a parametric {{study on the}} dynamics of trachytic (alkaline) versus rhyolitic (calc-alkaline) eruptions by employing a steady, isothermal, multiphase non-equilibrium model of <b>conduit</b> <b>flow</b> and fragmentation. The employed compositions correspond to a typical rhyolite and to trachytic liquids from Phlegrean Fields eruptions,for which detailed viscosity measurements have been performed. The investigated conditions include conduit diameters in the range 30 - 90 m and total water contents from 2 to 6 wt...|$|R
40|$|In many {{branch of}} engineering, {{it has been}} {{important}} problem to understand quantitatively flows in curved pipe, or along curved surface from the practical point of view. in particular, pressure losse dates are available for the analysis and design of internal flow system. for example, in dam <b>conduit,</b> the <b>flow</b> is generally three-dimensional and theoretical treatment is considerably complicated. In this paper, imcompressible potential flow in curved pipe of comparatively small curvature is treated considering the influence of centrifugal force and deduced practical simple equation. Similar treatment is given for the flow over flood chute of dam. Pressure loses and <b>flow</b> velocity in <b>conduit</b> <b>flow</b> have been measured in model experiment, the measured is considered, from the practical point of view, {{to be in good}} agreement with the calculated...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of mating signals and preferences assists speciation by facilitating assortative mating within diverging lineages, thereby <b>closing</b> down <b>conduits</b> of gene <b>flow</b> between lineages. However, sexual communication traits are frequently subject to stabilizing selection, suggesting that new variants {{will be selected}} against, thereby discouraging their divergent evolution. Pleiotropic mutations may assist the {{evolution of}} sexual communication systems by introducing genetic covariation to signal and preference traits. New data {{from a range of}} taxa and sensory modalities are challenging more traditional views on the general importance of pleiotropy in sexual signaling systems.

30|$|In this study, we derive {{a simple}} formula for calculating the {{porosity}} in dome-forming eruptions {{as a function}} of the magma properties and geological conditions. This formula is based on a 1 -dimensional steady <b>conduit</b> <b>flow</b> model that considers vertical gas escape from magma. This formula enables us to systematically investigate how porosity changes in response to changes in viscosity and permeability during magma ascent and also to identify the essential effects controlling the porosity profile in the conduit.|$|R
