40|$|ABSTRACT: The Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) {{owns and}} {{operates}} the wastewater collection and treatment system that services over 550, 000 citizens in the City of Portland, Oregon. BES is focused on improvement of the wastewater and storm water systems that protect the precious natural river resources {{that gave birth to}} the City and provides the economic and recreational vitality that will dictate {{the quality of life in}} the 21 st century and beyond. BES continues to evolve its management and operations in its third century of stewardship as a leader in the application of trenchless technologies for wastewater collection system infrastructure projects. Recently, a project to replace nearly one-half mile of 30 -inch and 24 -inch diameter <b>combination</b> <b>trunk</b> sewer in the Woods basin of southwest Portland was identified as an emergency project requiring immediate repair. The 1880 ’s era brick and stone sewer is buried fifty feet beneath existing freeways and four important arterial streets. The sewer completely failed at one location leading to a sinkhole, and exhibited significant signs of distress in other locations over 2, 500 linear feet. An emergency repair and diversion scheme was completed, and a complete design effort was started immediately thereafter. BES engineers, with the assistance of stakeholders and consultants, completed a design that resulted in the use of five separate trenchless segments to augment the traditional open trench construction method...|$|E

40|$|Net CO 2 {{assimilation}} rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), {{and weight}} per unit leaf area (W) were determined on Thompson Seedless grapevines {{grown in the}} field. Treatments included fruit set applications of gibberellic acid (40 milligrams gibberellic acid (GA 3) per liter) to vines, shoots and clusters, alone and in <b>combination</b> with <b>trunk</b> girdling. Leaf A and gs were measured prior to and 3, 6, and 13 days after fruit set. Weight per unit leaf area was determined on leaves collected subsequent to gas exchange measurements. Leaf A of girdled vines was reduced approximately 30 % {{when compared to the}} control 13 days after treatment. The reduction in A due to girdling was not as great when vines were sprayed with GA 3. GA 3 sprays alone had no significant effect on A. Stomatal conductance was reduced by girdling 13 days after treatment. Weight per unit leaf area was 17 % greater for trunk girdled vines when compared to the controls. Results indicate GA 3 affected net CO 2 assimilation rate only on girdled vines, a treatment which increased weight per unit leaf area...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{simulation}} {{has been}} used to investigate several aspects of locomotion in salamanders. Here we introduce a three-dimensional forward dynamics mechanical model of a salamander, with physically realistic weight and size parameters. Movements of the four limbs and of the trunk and tail are generated by sets of linearly modeled skeletal muscles. In this study, activation of these muscles were driven by prescribed neural output patterns. The model was successfully used to mimic locomotion on level ground and in water. We compare the walking gait where a wave of activity in the axial muscles travels between the girdles, with the trotting gait in simulations using the musculo-mechanical model. In a separate experiment, the model is used to compare different strategies for turning while stepping; either by bending the trunk or by using side-stepping in the front legs. We found that for turning, the use of side-stepping alone or in <b>combination</b> with <b>trunk</b> bending, was more effective than the use of trunk bending alone. We conclude that the musculo-mechanical model described here together with a proper neural controller is useful for neuro-physiological experiments in silico...|$|R

25|$|In {{a review}} article by Pierce & Buxbaum (2002), they {{concluded}} that the evidence for Hemispheric Activation Approaches, which focuses on moving the limb {{on the side of}} the neglect, has conflicting evidence in the literature. The authors note that a possible limitation in this approach is the requirement for the patients to actively move the neglected limb, which may not be possible for many patients. Constraint-Induced Therapy (CIT), appears to be an effective, long-term treatment for improving neglect in various studies. However, the use of CIT is limited to patients who have active control of wrist and hand extension. Prism Glasses, Hemispatial Glasses, and Eye-Patching have all appear to be effective in improving performance on neglect tests. Caloric Stimulation treatment appears to be effective in improving neglect; however, the effects are generally short-term. The review also suggests that Optokinetic Stimulation is effective in improving position sense, motor skills, body orientation, and perceptual neglect on a short-term basis. As with Caloric Stimulation treatment, long-term studies will be necessary to show its effectiveness. A few Trunk Rotation Therapy studies suggest its effectiveness in improving performance on neglect tests as well as the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Some less studied treatment possibilities include treatments that target Dorsal Stream of visual processing, Mental Imagery Training, and Neck Vibration Therapy. Trunk rotation therapies aimed at improving postural disorders and balance deficits in patients with unilateral neglect, have demonstrated optimistic results in regaining voluntary trunk control when using specific postural rehabilitative devices. One such device is the Bon Saint Côme apparatus, which uses spatial exploratory tasks in combination with auditory and visual feedback mechanisms to develop trunk control. The Bon Saint Côme device has been shown to be effective with hemiplegic subjects due to the <b>combination</b> of <b>trunk</b> stability exercises, along with the cognitive requirements needed to perform the postural tasks.|$|R
40|$|Independent sitting {{is a major}} {{milestone}} and is also {{a prerequisite}} for optimal performance of {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs). Development of sitting posture control is a dynamic process involving control of degrees of freedom of head and trunk. Traditionally, trunk has been modeled as a single unit (segment). However, recent studies have suggested that it is made up multiple spinal units, controlled by a <b>combination</b> of <b>trunk</b> muscles. During typical development, posture control of trunk is different for different trunk segments. This motor development of trunk control is a complex process due to constant interaction between the nervous system and environment. Any interruption in the normal processes would further complicate it, affecting the typical development of the child. Poor trunk control and respiratory complications are characteristic features among children, adolescents, and adults with neuromuscular disorders. Pediatric spinal cord injuries (SCIs) also pose a unique challenge compared to SCI in adults because of the continuous physical and cognitive development. Children with SCI exhibit deficits in trunk motor control, which impair their ability to sit or ambulate. These motor deficits can lead to compensatory changes in other segments of the body, which cause further deviations from typical postures. Trunk muscles have the dual function of supporting both, breathing and trunk posture. Therefore, in children with SCI, impairment of posture control will also affect respiratory functions. Depending on level and severity of the injury, can potentially lead to severe respiratory insufficiency. Symptoms of respiratory insufficiency are highly correlated with the level and severity of spinal lesions. Injury at higher cervical and thoracic cord levels causes paresis and paralysis of most of the respiratory muscles, which increase the workload of breathing. As a result, respiratory complications are {{the leading cause of death}} among children with SCI. Therefore, impairment of posture control following SCI also affects respiratory functions. Lack of appropriate tools to evaluate trunk motor control following SCI restricts the ability to understand its development and therefore it is a challenge to design treatments and strategies to slow down or prevent the progress of long-term effects of SCI in children. In this dissertation, we studied the postural control using a Segmental Assessment Trunk Control (SATCo) test and respiratory motor control using Respiratory Motor Control Assessment (RMCA) protocol in typically developing (TD) children and compared their results to age-matched children with SCI...|$|R
40|$|In many {{occupational}} settings (e. g. {{agriculture and}} construction) workers {{are asked to}} maintain static flexed postures of the low back for extended periods of time. Recent research indicates that the resulting strain in the viscoelastic, ligamentous tissues may have a deleterious effect on {{the stability of the}} spine and the normal reflex response of spinal tissues. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the previously described flexion-relaxation response in terms of the interactive effect of trunk flexion angle (30 °, 50 °, 70 °, 90 °), knee flexion angle (0 ° (straight knees), 20 °, 40 °) and individual flexibiliteky (low, medium, and high). These conditions were tested under two levels of loading: no load (just supporting the weight of the torso) and trunk extension moment equal to 50 % of the subject's posture-specific maximum voluntary trunk extension capacity. Surface electromyographic (EMG) data were collected from the multifidus, the longissimus, the iliocostalis, the vastus medialis, the rectus femoris, the vastus lateralis, the biceps femoris, and the gastrocnemius-soleus group from a sample of eight male participants as they performed isometric weight holding tasks in the postures defined by the <b>combinations</b> of <b>trunk</b> angle and knee angle. The results of this study showed that knee angle did have a significant effect on the lumbar extensor muscle activity but only consistently at the 90 ° trunk angle. Participant flexibility showed a consistent trend of decreasing lumbar extensor muscle activity with decreased flexibility across all trunk angle values. Most interesting was the interactive response of flexibility and knee angle, wherein the flexibility of the participant influenced the trunk angles at which the knee flexion angle affected the flexion-relaxation response. Highly flexible subjects showed an effect of knee angle on the flexion-relaxation response only at the 90 ° trunk angle; subjects in the medium flexibility category showed a similar response in both the 70 ° and 90 ° trunk angles; subject in the low flexibility group showed no knee angle effect on the flexion-relaxation response. Overall the results confirm previous results with regard to the contribution of the passive tissues to the overall trunk extension moment but also show that the tension in the bi-articular biceps femoris, which was influenced by knee flexion angle and flexibility, affects the ratio of active extensor moment contributions of the lumbar extensor musculature to passive extensor moment contributions from the muscular and ligamentous tissues. The results of this study provide empirical data describing this complicated, interactive response. close 273...|$|R
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Control {{laboratory}} study consisting of preintervention and postintervention measurements. OBJECTIVE: To {{determine the effects}} of a putting practice session on the kinematics of full golf swings made by skilled male golfers. BACKGROUND: Skilled golfers perform putting practice for prolonged periods. The <b>combination</b> of sustained <b>trunk</b> flexion with minimal trunk motion may affect the endurance capacity of the trunk extensor muscles. Because of their important role in the golf swing, any impairment of the trunk extensors may negatively influence full-swing kinematics, but this has not been previously evaluated. METHODS AND MEASURES: Three-dimensional swing kinematics and holding time on the Biering-S貥nsen test of isometric trunk extensor endurance were evaluated in 29 skilled male golfers before and after performing a 40 -minute putting task. RESULTS: After the intervention, peak segmental speeds were reduced and total swing duration increased (mean ᠓D, 36 ᠵ 5 milliseconds). There were reductions in the magnitude of pelvis and torso axial rotation during the downswing (mean ᠓D, - 2. 3 ࠱ 2. 6 ࠡnd - 2. 3 ࠱ 4. 7 ଠrespectively). The peak difference between torso rotation and pelvis rotation during early downswing was also significantly reduced by 0. 9 ࠱ 2. 0 ࠨP<. 05). The effects on pelvis and torso rotation were smallest for golfers with higher body mass index (BMI). Holding time on the Biering-S貥nsen test after putting practice was significantly reduced by 25. 7 ᠲ 3. 8 seconds (P =. 01). CONCLUSION: Changes in swing kinematics observed following 40 minutes of putting practice might have resulted from fatigue-related impairment of the trunk extensor muscles, a view supported by the poorer performance on the postintervention Biering-S貥nsen test. Results showed that swing kinematics of golfers with high BMI were least affected by the putting practice. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Harm, level 5.

40|$|Postembryonic {{development}} in the kinorhynch species Antygomonas incomitata was examined using scanning electron microscopy. The morphology of the six juvenile stages, J- 1 to J- 6, varies at numerous details, {{but they can also}} be distinguished by a few key characters. Juvenile stage 1 by its composition of only nine trunk segments; J- 2 by the combination of possessing 10 trunk segments, but no cuspidate spines on segment 9; J- 3 by the presence of cuspidate spines on segment 9, but only one pair of cuspidate spines on segment 8; J- 4 by the <b>combination</b> of 10 <b>trunk</b> segments only, but having two pairs of cuspidate spines on segment 8; J- 5 by possessing 11 trunk segments and same spine compositions as adults but is still maintaining postmarginal spiculae; J- 6 specimens closely resemble adults and are most easily identified by their reduced trunk lengths. New segments are formed in a growth zone in the anterior part of the terminal segment. The complete number of segments is reached in J- 5. Development of cuticular head and trunk structures are described through all postembryonic stages and following developmental patterns could be outlined: the mouth cone possesses outer oral styles from J- 1, but in J- 1 to J- 3, the styles alternate in size. Scalids of the introvert are added after each molt, and scalids appear earliest in the anterior rings, whereas scalids in more posterior rings are added in older postembryonic stages. The early J- 1 stage is poor in spines and sensory spots and both structures increase in number after each molt. The complete spine composition is reached in J- 4, whereas new sensory spots appear after all molts, inclusive the final one from J- 6 to adult. Sensory spots in the paraventral positions often appear as Type 3 sensory spots but are through development transformed to Type 2. This transformation happens earliest on the anterior segments...|$|R
40|$|Locomotion is an {{integral}} part of a whole range of animal behaviours. The basic rhythm for locomotion in vertebrates has been shown to arise from local networks residing in the spinal cord and these networks are known as central pattern generators (CPG). However, during the locomotion, these centres are constantly interacting with the sensory feedback signals coming from muscles, joints and peripheral skin receptors in order to adapt the stepping or swimming to varying environmental conditions. Conceptual models of vertebrate locomotion have been constructed using mathematical models of locomotor subsystems based on the neurophysiological evidence obtained primarily in the cat and the salamander, an amphibian with a sprawling posture. Such models provide opportunity for studying the key elements in the transition from aquatic to terrestrial locomotion. Several aspects of locomotor control using the cat or the salamander as an animal model have been investigated employing computer simulations and here we use the same approach to address a number of questions or/and hypotheses related to rhythmic locomotion in quadrupeds. Some of the involved questions are, the role of mechanical linkage during deafferented walking, finding inherent stabilities/instabilities of muscle-joint interactions during normal walking and estimating phase dependent controlability of muscle action over joints. Also we investigate limb and body coordination for different gaits, use of side-stepping in front limbs for turning and the role of sensory feedback in gait generation and transitions in salamanders.      This thesis presents the basics of the biologically realistic models of cat and salamander locomotion and summarizes computational methods in modeling quadruped locomotor subsystems such as CPG, limb muscles and sensory pathways. In the case of cat hind limb, we conclude that the mechanical linkages between the legs play a major role in producing the alternating gait. In another experiment we use the model to identify open-loop linear transfer functions between muscle activations and joint angles while ongoing locomotion. We hypothesize that the musculo-skeletal system for locomotion in animals, at least in cats, operates under critically damped condition.      The 3 D model of the salamander is successfully used to mimic locomotion on level ground and in water. We compare the walking gait with the trotting gait in simulations. We also found that for turning, the use of side-stepping alone or in <b>combination</b> with <b>trunk</b> bending is more effective than the use of trunk bending alone. The same model together with a more realistic CPG composed of spiking neurons was used to investigate the role of sensory feedback in gait generation and transition. We found that the proprioceptive sensory inputs are essential in obtaining the walking gait, whereas the trotting gait is more under central (CPG) influence compared to that of the peripheral or sensory feedback.      This thesis work sheds light on understanding the neural control mechanisms behind vertebrate locomotion. Additionally, both neuro-mechanical models can be used for further investigations in finding new control algorithms which give robust, adaptive, efficient and realistic stepping in each leg, which would be advantageous since it can be implemented on a controller of a quadruped-robotic device.
