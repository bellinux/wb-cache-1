500|$|Wrinch {{developed}} this suggestion into a full-fledged model of protein structure. [...] The basic cyclol model {{was laid out}} in her first paper (1936). [...] She noted the possibility that polypeptides might <b>cyclize</b> to form closed rings (true) and that these rings might form internal crosslinks through the cyclol reaction (also true, although rare). [...] Assuming that the cyclol form of the peptide bond could be more stable than the amide form, Wrinch concluded that certain cyclic peptides would naturally make the maximal number of cyclol bonds (such as cyclol 6, Figure 2). [...] Such cyclol molecules would have hexagonal symmetry, if the chemical bonds were taken as having the same length, roughly 1.5Å; for comparison, the N-C and C-C bonds have the lengths 1.42Å and 1.54Å, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Paal–Knorr furan synthesis was elucidated in 1995 by V. Amarnath et al. [...] Amarnath's work showed that the diastereomers of 3,4-disubstituted-2,5-hexane diones react at different rates. [...] In the commonly accepted mechanism, these diones would go through a common enol intermediate, meaning that the meso and d,l-racemic isomers would <b>cyclize</b> {{at the same rate}} as they form from a common intermediate. [...] The implication of different reaction is that cyclization needs to occur in a concerted step with enol formation. [...] Thus the mechanism was proposed to occur via attack of the protonated carbonyl with the forming enol. [...] Amarnath also found that the unreacted dione had not undergone conformational isomerization, which also indicated that an enol was not an intermediate.|$|E
2500|$|While the decaketide {{is still}} {{associated}} with the KS/CLF heterodimer the 9-carbonyl group is reduced by Dps E, the 9-ketoreductase, using NADPH as the reducing agent/hydride donor. [...] Dps F, the “1st ring cyclase” /aromatase, is very specific {{and is in the}} family of C-7/C-12 cyclases that require prior C-9 keto-reduction. [...] These two reactions are felt to occur while the polyketide chain is still partially in the KS/CLF tunnel and it is not known what finally cleaves the chain from its covalent link to the KS or ACP. If the Dps F cyclase is inactivated by mutations or gene deletions, the chain will <b>cyclize</b> spontaneously in random fashion. Thus, Dps F is thought to “chaperone” or help fold the polyketide to ensure non-random cyclization, a reaction that is energetically favorable and leads to subsequent dehydration and resultant aromatization.|$|E
2500|$|Somatic {{mutations}} {{cannot be}} {{passed down from}} parent to offspring, but these mutations can propagate in cell lines within an organism. [...] Radiation damage can also cause chromosome and chromatid aberrations, and their effect depends on what stage of the mitotic cycle the cell is currently in when the irradiation occurs. [...] If the cell is in interphase, while {{it is still a}} single strand of chromatin, the damage will be replicated during the S1 phase of cell cycle, {{and there will be a}} break on both chromosome arms. [...] Then the damage will be apparent in both daughter cells. [...] If the irradiation occurs after replication, only one arm will bear the damage.
