500|$|Nurkse {{states that}} if {{demand for the}} output of one sector rises, due to the {{complementary}} nature of demand, the demand for the output of other industries will also experience a rise. Paul Rosenstein-Rodan spoke of a similar concept called [...] "indivisibility of demand" [...] which hypothesises that if large investments are made in {{a large number of}} industries simultaneously, an underdeveloped economy can become developed due to the phenomenon of complementary demand. However, both Nurkse and Rosenstein-Rodan only took into consideration the situation of industries that produce <b>complementary</b> <b>goods.</b> There are substitute goods too, which are in competition with each other. Thus if the state pumps in large investments into the car industry, for example, it will naturally lead to a rise in the demand for petrol. But if the state makes large scale investments in the coffee sector of a country, the tea sector will suffer.|$|E

40|$|An {{integrated}} monopoly, {{where all}} complements forming a composite good are {{offered by a}} single firm, is typically welfare superior to a complementary monopoly. This is the "tragedy of the anticommons". We consider the possibility of competition {{in the market for}} each complement. We present a model with two perfect complements and introduce n imperfect substitutes for one and then for both complements. We prove that, if one <b>complementary</b> <b>good</b> is produced by a monopolist, and if competition for the other complement does not vary the average quality in the market, then an integrated monopoly is still superior. In such case, favoring competition in some sectors, leaving monopolies in others would be detrimental for consumers and producers alike. Competition may be preferred if and only if the substitutes of the <b>complementary</b> <b>good</b> differ in their quality, so that as their number increases, average quality and/or quality variance increases. Results change when competition is introduced in each sector. In this case, if goods are close substitutes, we find that competition may be welfare superior for {{a relatively small number of}} competing firms in each sector, even with no quality differentiation. ...|$|R

40|$|Tying a good {{produced}} monopolistically with a <b>complementary</b> <b>good</b> {{produced in}} an oligopolistic market {{in which there}} is room for collusion can be profitable if some buyers of the oligopoly good have no demand for the monopoly good. The reason is that a tie makes part of the demand in the oligopolistic market {{out of the reach of}} the tying firm's rivals, which decreases the profitability of deviating from a collusive agreement. Tying may thus facilitate collusion. It may also allow the tying firm to alter market share allocation in a collusive oligopolistic market...|$|R

We will consider compatibility in two dimensions: compatibility of the <b>complementary</b> <b>good</b> and inter-network compatibility. We show that if products are substitutes, compatibility tends to be welfare decreasing with the potential negative consequences of increasing compatibility being more likely when asymmetries are strong. We also find that in many instances the dominant firm’s interests regarding compatibility {{are in line with}} those of users, and are opposite to those of the weak firm, which will always demand more compatibility to be enforced. Finally we show that compatibility may harm innovation, particularly for the dominant firm. ...|$|R

The network of petrol stations provides the <b>complementary</b> <b>good.</b> We use a two-stage game in prices and characteristics to analyse the market structure. In order to find out whether a private decision on the type of engine coincides with a socially optimal product differentiation, we determine the position of the two types of engine by a welfare-maximizing authority.
