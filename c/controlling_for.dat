A survey of species richness and geographical range size did not show the decrease in range size from temperate regions to the tropics that had been previously assumed; although that pattern was largely true in the northern hemisphere, it did not appear to apply in the southern hemisphere. Research evaluating the relationship between extinction and human impact showed that, after <b>controlling</b> <b>for</b> species richness, the best predictors of the global pattern of extinction risk are measures of human impact, with ecological factors being of secondary importance. An examination of the distribution of rare and threatened vertebrate species, showed differing patterns for bird, mammal and amphibian species, which has consequences for hotspot-based conservation strategies.|$|E

40|$|In {{light of}} the complex and highly {{uncertain}} nature of dynamical systems requiring controls, {{it is not surprising}} that reliable system models for many high performance engineering and life science applications are unavailable. In the face of such high levels of system uncertainty, robust controllers may unnecessarily sacrifice system performance whereas adaptive controllers are clearly appropriate since they can tolerate far greater system uncertainty levels to improve system performance. In this dissertation, we develop a Lyapunov-based direct adaptive and neural adaptive control framework that addresses parametric uncertainty, unstructured uncertainty, disturbance rejection, amplitude and rate saturation constraints, and digital implementation issues. Specifically, we consider the following research topics: direct adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear uncertain systems with exogenous disturbances; robust adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear uncertain systems; adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear uncertain systems with actuator amplitude and rate saturation constraints; adaptive reduced-order dynamic compensation for nonlinear uncertain systems; direct adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear matrix second-order dynamical systems with state-dependent uncertainty; adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonnegative and compartmental dynamical systems with applications to general anesthesia; direct adaptive control of nonnegative and compartmental dynamical systems with time delay; adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear nonnegative and compartmental dynamical systems with applications to clinical pharmacology; neural network adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear nonnegative dynamical systems; passivity-based neural network adaptive output feedback <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear nonnegative dynamical systems; neural network adaptive dynamic output feedback <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear nonnegative systems using tapped delay memory units; Lyapunov-based adaptive <b>control</b> framework <b>for</b> discrete-time nonlinear systems with exogenous disturbances; direct discrete-time adaptive control with guaranteed parameter error convergence; and hybrid adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear uncertain impulsive dynamical systems.
