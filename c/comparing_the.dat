5|$|Temple Meads is {{the busiest}} {{station in the}} Bristol area.

30|$|Figures 7 and 8 <b>compare</b> <b>the</b> BER {{performance}} of different detectors in 8 × 8 system with 16 QAM modulation. Figure 7 <b>compares</b> <b>the</b> BER {{performance of}} different ZF detectors, while Fig. 8 <b>compares</b> <b>the</b> BER performance of different MMSE detectors.

5|$|The borders {{between the}} four {{subspecies}} are not sharp, because the subspecies interbreed. Many {{studies have been}} performed in the border regions to assess the intermediate turtles, usually by <b>comparing</b> <b>the</b> anatomical features of hybrids that result from intergradation of the classical subspecies. Despite the imprecision, the subspecies are assigned nominal ranges.|$|E
5|$|A {{controlled}} {{comparative study}} by the Navy Experimental Diving Unit in the NEDU Ocean Simulation Facility wet-pot <b>comparing</b> <b>the</b> VVAL18 Thalmann Algorithm with a deep stop profile suggests that the deep stops schedule had {{a greater risk of}} DCS than the matched (same total stop time) conventional schedule. The proposed explanation was that slower gas washout or continued gas uptake offset benefits of reduced bubble growth at deep stops.|$|E
5|$|Ages for star {{clusters}} {{can be estimated}} by <b>comparing</b> <b>the</b> Hertzsprung–Russell diagram for the cluster with theoretical models of stellar evolution. Using this technique, ages for the Pleiades of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated. The wide spread in estimated ages {{is a result of}} uncertainties in stellar evolution models, which include factors such as convective overshoot, in which a convective zone within a star penetrates an otherwise non-convective zone, resulting in higher apparent ages.|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} section presents simulation results that <b>compare</b> <b>the</b> QoS offered by PBOA and MUD-MAC {{measured in terms}} of aggregate throughput, delay, and fairness. Additionally, we <b>compare</b> <b>the</b> two CLDs to the 802.11 protocol.|$|R
30|$|Then, in Section 6.3, {{for both}} the Spark and Hadoop implementations, we <b>compare</b> <b>the</b> {{performance}} of our new algorithms relative to a single mapper and a single reducer. In doing so, we not only <b>compare</b> <b>the</b> overall performance, but we also <b>compare</b> <b>the</b> fundamental building blocks of the particle filtering algorithm. This section provides {{a thorough understanding of}} these algorithms’ performance on two key frameworks that support MapReduce.|$|R
30|$|For the {{crossover}} operator, {{we conducted}} three analyses: first, we <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> {{performance of the}} genetic framework with the exhaustive framework (crossover 0.6). Second, we <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> performance of the genetic framework with the exhaustive framework (crossover 0.7). Finally, we <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> performance of the genetic framework with the exhaustive framework (crossover 0.9). Our hypothesis says that the performance is similar between the exhaustive framework and each genetic framework configuration.|$|R
5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at approximately the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by <b>comparing</b> <b>the</b> magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Because of Billingsley's long-standing {{friendship}} with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged. During {{his work on}} the Stork Club book, author and New York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by <b>comparing</b> <b>the</b> file to the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.|$|E
5|$|Binary search {{works on}} sorted arrays. Binary search begins by <b>comparing</b> <b>the</b> middle {{element of the}} array with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, its {{position}} in the array is returned. If the target value is less than or greater than the middle element, the search continues in the lower or upper half of the array, respectively, eliminating the other half from consideration.|$|E

5|$|CNET TV torture-tested an SIII by cooling it to , {{placing it}} in a heat-proof box and heating it to , and {{submerging}} it in water—the SIII survived all three tests. The phone also did not exhibit any scratches when a key was repeatedly scraped against the display. However, Android Authority later carried out a drop test {{with the purpose of}} <b>comparing</b> <b>the</b> SIII and the iPhone 5. The screen on the SIII shattered on the second drop test, while the iPhone received only minor scuffs and scratches on the metal composite frame after three drop tests.|$|E
5|$|Declination is {{positive}} for an eastward deviation {{of the field}} relative to true north. It can be estimated by <b>comparing</b> <b>the</b> magnetic north/south heading on a compass with {{the direction of a}} celestial pole. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).|$|E
