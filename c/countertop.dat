The extension houses an elevator between the basement and two above-ground floors. The first floor has a circulation desk of cherry- and caramel-stained wood with a granite <b>countertop.</b> It was sold to the library by craftsman and village resident Leonard Rerek at a significant discount. The first floor also includes a teen center with computers and a breakout room, {{as well as a}} children's room with its own breakout room. The second floor holds the adult fiction, non-fiction, and reference collections, as well as four computers, library offices, and a partitionable program room seating up to 80 people. The extension's interior was designed by architect, village resident, and library board member Catherine Bukard. The exterior was designed by Lothrop Associates.|$|E

25|$|The term mainly {{refers to}} a mix of lithium and aluminosilicates that yields an array of {{materials}} with interesting thermomechanical properties. The most commercially important of these have {{the distinction of being}} impervious to thermal shock. Thus, glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for <b>countertop</b> cooking. The negative thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive CTE of the glassy phase. At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net CTE near zero. This type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000Â°C.|$|E

50|$|Cultured marble <b>countertops</b> are {{man made}} vanity tops {{that have the}} {{appearance}} of and resemble real stone marble. Cultured marble <b>countertops</b> are made by mixing high strength polyester resin and real marble stone dust. The combination is then formulated with additional chemicals and poured into a cast mold. These molds can ultimately produce bathtubs, whirlpool decks, shower pans, window sills, and even vanity tops. The finished material is significantly less expensive than natural marble and four times stronger than natural stones such as granite or marble. The process of using a mold also allows the fabricated <b>countertops</b> to have features such as different surface textures and {{a vast array of}} colors which natural stone can not. Cultured marble <b>countertops</b> are aesthetically pleasing and a more economical and durable alternative to real stone marble.|$|R

2500|$|After {{the show}} got picked up to reduce {{production}} costs the interior, backyard, and pool house was rebuilt at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach, Ca. [...] During some early episodes in season 1, the Cohens were doing some extensive remodeling; {{this was probably}} written in because the new set did not accurately recreate the original home in Malibu. [...] The kitchen <b>countertop</b> changed from a dark grey granite to a light beige marble <b>countertop.</b> [...] The sink in the island <b>countertop</b> switches {{to the other side}} and the backsplash tile changes. During the pilot episode Ryan walked out of the pool house to look at the ocean view. [...] Past the property line there were houses, streets, cars, and land between the house and the ocean.

40|$|Emanation of radon (222 Rn) from granite <b>countertops</b> was {{measured}} using continuous and integrating radon monitors, and in air collected from encapsulated pieces of the <b>countertops.</b> A majority of the <b>countertops</b> emitted a measurable amount of radon. Although the granites contained the precursors, no thoron (220 Rn) emanation was detected. Gamma-ray spectroscopy {{was used to determine}} amounts of radium (222 Rn precursor) and other radionuclides in the granites. There was a correlation (r 2 = 0. 50) between the measured radon emanation and the radium content of the granites. Based on gamma-ray spectroscopy results, radon-emanation losses from the granite samples averaged 26 % of the total radium concentrations. Although some granite <b>countertops</b> emitted substantial amounts of radon (range = < 0. 1 - 2. 3 pCi/L), the contribution to indoor radon concentrations was estimated to average 0. 6 pCi/L...|$|R

Usually the dish holds just enough water to submerge the interior lip when the dish is closed. Butter is packed into the lid. The water acts as a seal to keep the butter fresh, and also keeps the butter from overheating in hot temperatures. This method lets butter sit on a <b>countertop</b> for several days without spoiling.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of the cavity magnetron in the UK made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength (microwaves). American engineer Percy Spencer is generally credited with inventing the modern microwave oven after World War II from radar technology developed during the war. Named the [...] "Radarange", it was first sold in 1946. Raytheon later licensed its patents for a home-use microwave oven that was first introduced by Tappan in 1955, but these units were still too large and expensive for general home use. The <b>countertop</b> microwave oven was first introduced in 1967 by the Amana Corporation, and their use has spread into commercial and residential kitchens around the world.

2500|$|In 1947, Raytheon {{built the}} [...] "Radarange", the first commercially {{available}} microwave oven. It was almost [...] tall, weighed [...] and cost about US$5,000 ($ in [...] dollars) each. It consumed 3 kilowatts, {{about three times}} as much as today's microwave ovens, and was water-cooled. The name was the winning entry in an employee contest. An early Radarange was installed (and remains) in the galley of the nuclear-powered passenger/cargo ship NS Savannah. An early commercial model introduced in 1954 consumed 1.6 kilowatts and sold for US$2,000 to US$3,000 ($ to $ in [...] dollars). Raytheon licensed its technology to the Tappan Stove company of Mansfield, Ohio in 1952. They tried to market a large 220 volt wall unit as a home microwave oven in 1955 for a price of US$1,295 ($ in [...] dollars), but it did not sell well. In 1965, Raytheon acquired Amana.

2500|$|In 1988, Santa Claus {{had three}} tiny, poorly {{maintained}} A-frame buildings painted to represent peppermint candies. American writer Mark Winegardner described Santa Claus {{at that time}} as being on its last legs. Additionally, Winegardner noted in his 1988 book Elvis Presley Boulevard: From Sea to Shining Sea, Almost, that"Styrofoam silver bells, strands of burned-out Christmas lights and faded plastic likenesses of Old Saint Nick garnished this little village. A lopsided, artificial twenty-foot tree whistled in the wind beside a broken Coke machine and an empty ice freezer. Two of the three buildings were padlocked; through their windows, encrusted with layers of sand and decade-old aerosol snow, ... I saw dusty, overturned fiberglass statuettes of elves and reindeer. Alongside the SANTA CLAUS, ARIZONA/ESTABLISHED 1937 sign was another: FOR SALE BY OWNER/$52,500/INQUIRE AT GIFTSHOP. An arrow pointed the way.""The gift shop stocked no seasonal items. Its shelves were littered with flea-market [...] at antique-shop prices. Battered paperbacks cost a buck.

2500|$|His lectures {{frequently}} {{lasted for}} three or four hours. [...] His longest known lecture defined the unit of time known as the [...] "Woodward", after which his other lectures were deemed to be so many [...] "milli-Woodwards" [...] long. In many of these, he eschewed the use of slides and drew structures by using multicolored chalk. Typically, to begin a lecture, Woodward would arrive and lay out two large white handkerchiefs on the <b>countertop.</b> Upon one would be four or five colors of chalk (new pieces), neatly sorted by color, in a long row. Upon the other handkerchief would be placed an equally impressive row of cigarettes. The previous cigarette would be used to light the next one. His Thursday seminars at Harvard often lasted well into the night. He had a fixation with blue, and many of his suits, his car, and even his parking space were coloured in blue. In one of his laboratories, his students hung a large black and white photograph of the master from the ceiling, complete with a large blue [...] "tie" [...] appended. There it hung for some years (early 1970s), until scorched in a minor laboratory fire. He detested exercise, could get along with only a few hours of sleep every night, was a heavy smoker, and enjoyed Scotch whisky and martinis.|$|E
