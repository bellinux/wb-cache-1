5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, <b>chancroid</b> and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among {{men who have sex}} with men, reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, with the possible exception of syphilis.|$|E
25|$|Other {{cancerous}} lesions in {{the differential}} diagnosis include Paget's disease of the vulva and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). Non-cancerous vulvar diseases include lichen sclerosus, squamous cell hyperplasia, and vulvar vestibulitis.

50|$|Coxiella burnetti {{is also a}} coccobacillus. Bacteria {{from the}} Brucella genus are {{medically}} important coccobacilli that cause brucellosis.

50|$|Practical {{clinical}} {{approach for}} this STI as Genital Ulcer Disease is {{to rule out}} top differential diagnosis of Syphilis and Herpes and consider empirical treatment for <b>Chancroid</b> as testing is not commonly done for the latter.|$|E

50|$|Rudolf Waldemar Rømeling Krefting (3 February 1860 - 17 August 1942) was a Norwegian dermatologist. He {{was born}} in Kvikne. He is {{particularly}} known for his studies of the <b>chancroid</b> and the coccobacillus haemophilus ducreyi. He {{was the father of}} Kristian Krefting.|$|E
50|$|Sulfadiazine is a sulfonamide antibiotic. Used {{together}} with pyrimethamine, {{it is the}} treatment of choice for toxoplasmosis.

50|$|H. ducreyi is an {{opportunistic}} microorganism that infects {{its host}} {{by way of}} breaks in the skin or epidermis. Inflammation then takes place as the area of infection is inundated with lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. This pyrogenic inflammation causes regional lymphadenitis in the sexually transmitted bacillus <b>chancroid.</b>|$|E

Non-cancerous vulvar diseases include lichen sclerosus, squamous cell hyperplasia, and vulvar vestibulitis.

50|$|The venereal {{diseases}} include bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections. Some of {{the important}} diseases are HIV infection, syphilis, gonorrhea, candidiasis, herpes simplex, human papillomavirus infection, and genital scabies.

50|$|<b>Chancroid</b> is a {{bacterial}} infection {{caused by the}} fastidious Gram-negative streptobacillus Haemophilus ducreyi.

5000|$|Communicable {{diseases}} {{of public health}} significance.

[...] Individuals diagnosed with these illnesses may apply for a Waiver of Ground of Inadmissibility on Form I-601.|$|E
50|$|Infection {{levels are}} {{very low in}} the Western world, {{typically}} around one case per two million of the population (Canada, France, Australia, UK and US). Most individuals diagnosed with <b>chancroid</b> have visited countries or areas where the disease is known to occur frequently, although outbreaks have been observed in association with crack cocaine use and prostitution.|$|E
5000|$|A bubo (Greek βουβών, boubôn, [...] "groin") (plural form: buboes) is the {{swelling}} of the lymph nodes. It is found in infections such as bubonic plague, gonorrhea, chlamydia in lymphogranuloma venerum, tuberculosis, <b>chancroid</b> or syphilis. It is similar in appearance to a huge blister, and usually appears under the armpit, in the groin or on the neck.|$|E
50|$|A {{genital ulcer}} {{is located on}} the genital area, usually caused by a sexually {{transmitted}} disease such as genital herpes, syphilis, <b>chancroid,</b> or Chlamydia trachomatis. Some other signs of having genital ulcers include enlarged lymph nodes in the groin area, or vesicular lesions, which are small, elevated sores or blisters. The syndrome may be further classified into penile ulceration and vulval ulceration for males and females respectively.|$|E
50|$|Male {{circumcision}} {{had little}} to moderate effect in their simulations, but, given the geographical correlation found, the authors propose {{that it could have}} had an indirect role, either by increasing genital ulcer disease itself (it is known that syphilis, <b>chancroid,</b> and several other GUDs have higher incidences in uncircumcised men), or by permitting further spread of the HIV strain, after the first chains of sexual transmission permitted adaptation to the human organism.|$|E
50|$|Bacteria in {{the family}} Pasteurellaceae have been {{classified}} {{into a number of}} genera based on metabolic properties, but these classifications are not generally accurate reflections of the evolutionary relationships between different species. Haemophilus influenzae was the first organism to have its genome sequenced and has been studied intensively by genetic and molecular methodologies. The Haemophilus genus is a notorious human pathogen associated with bacteremia, pneumonia, meningitis and <b>chancroid.</b> Other pathogenic members belonging to the Pasteurellaceae family include Aggregatibacter, Mannheimia, Pasteurella, and Actinobacillus species.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, similar {{research}} was also {{conducted on the}} transmission and prophylaxis of gonorrhea and <b>chancroid.</b> The subjects {{for all of the}} STD experiments consisted of female sex workers, prisoners, soldiers, and mental hospital patients; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledges that [...] "the design and conduct of the studies was unethical in many respects, including deliberate exposure of subjects to known serious health threats, lack of knowledge of and consent for experimental procedures by study subjects, and the use of highly vulnerable populations." ...|$|E
