50|$|Secondary {{hyperparathyroidism}} occurs if {{the calcium}} level is abnormally low. The normal glands respond by secreting parathyroid hormone at a persistently high rate. This typically {{occurs when the}} 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels in the blood are low and there is hypocalcemia. A lack of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 can result from a deficient dietary intake of vitamin D, or {{from a lack of}} exposure of the skin to sunlight, so the body cannot make its own vitamin D from cholesterol. The resulting hypovitaminosis D is usually due to a partial combination of both factors. Vitamin D3 (or cholecalciferol) is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (or <b>calcidiol)</b> by the liver, from where it is transported via the circulation to the kidneys where it is converted into the active hormone, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between serum <b>calcidiol</b> levels and the onset and progression of aortic calcifications in a communitybased sample of ambulatory subjects. Methods: 302 men and women aged 50 and over underwent two lateral X-rays and were followed-up for 4 years. Abdominal aortic calcifications were classified as absent, mild-moderate, and severe. The biochemical measurements of serum calcium, phosphorus, PTH, total alkaline phosphatase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, creatinine, <b>calcidiol,</b> calcitriol and osteocalcin were determined. Subjects who had received anti-osteoporotic treatments were excluded from the analysis. Results: Subjects with progression of aortic calcifications had significantly lower serum <b>calcidiol</b> levels than those without progression. In the multivariate analysis, using the agreed upon serum levels for <b>calcidiol</b> (> 30 ng/mL) as the reference, those subjects with <b>calcidiol</b> levels between 10 to 20 ng/mL showed a higher risk of progression of aortic calcification (OR = 3. 95; 95 % CI = 1. 16 to 13. 40). An even higher OR was observed in subjects with <b>calcidiol</b> values < 10 ng/mL (OR = 4. 10; 95 %CI = 1. 12 to 14. 99). In addition, an increase by 1 ng/mL in osteocalcin levels was associated with a 17 % reduction of the risk of aortic calcification progression. Conclusions: An increase by 10 ng/mL of <b>calcidiol</b> was associated with a decrease in the risk of aortic calcifications progression by 44 %. This figure was even higher than that observed if we increased age by 10 years. Levels of <b>calcidiol</b> higher than 30 ng/mL seem to be desirable to reduce the progression of aortic calcification and to maintain bone turnover.

40|$|Objective: Osteoporosis is a {{skeletal}} disorder {{characterized by}} diminished bone strength, {{which results in}} {{an increased risk of}} fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is a public health priority due to the large number of individuals affected and the detrimental effect on quality of life. Primary osteoporosis, the most common form, usually results from age-related reduction in bone mineral strength. Over time, the individual's capacity to build bone is impaired, as the synthesis of vitamin D, the hormone responsible for calcium absorption, tends to decline. As serum calcium levels decrease, metabolic control serves to increase the removal of calcium from the skeleton {{to make up for the}} deficit. The synthesis of the ` hormone' vitamin D and its control therefore become central to intervention in involutional osteoporosis syndromes. In humans, plain vitamin D (cholecalciferol), also called parental or native vitamin D, is photosynthesized in the skin and then hydroxylated in the liver into the vitamin D analog <b>calcidiol</b> [25 (OH) D 3], which is hydroxylated again in the kidney into the vitamin D analog calcitriol [1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3]. The advantage of administering vitamin D analogs is that the pro-drug <b>calcidiol</b> avoids the effect of declines in hepatic function, while calcitriol avoids the effect of declines in hepatic and kidney function. A strategy to enhance [25 (OH) D 3] levels to the optimal threshold of vitamin D is supplementation with the <b>calcidiol</b> metabolite itself. The goal of this paper is to review published studies on the efficacy of the <b>calcidiol</b> metabolite in increasing 25 (OH) D 3 serum levels and improving skeletal health parameters in humans. Methods: A library search of published papers in the area of use of <b>calcidiol</b> in humans from 1967 to 2013 was performed (key words: <b>calcidiol,</b> 25 -hydroxy-vitamin D 3, vitamin D supplementation, vitamin D metabolism, osteomalacia).

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND AIMS Abnormal {{low levels}} of vitamin D are {{frequent}} in both general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease. In kidney transplant recipients, serum vitamin D levels are reported to increase from early post-transplant period. In this population, however, the assessment of vitamin D levels is not routinely performed despite the pleiotropic action of the hormone involved in both bone health control and in the reduction of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Therefore, it is clinically relevant to assess <b>calcidiol</b> concentration and find any potential factor which may affect its concentration. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to assess the levels of serum <b>calcidiol</b> and find out any potential factor associated with low <b>calcidiol</b> concentration in kidney transplant patients. METHODS 132 kidney transplant recipients, followed in one nephrology unit, were enrolled. The analyzed variables were immunosuppressive agents, supplementary intake of <b>calcidiol</b> or 1 - 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D, intact PTH, eGFR, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, urinary calcium excretion, urinary phosphorus excretion, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, total protein, albumin. On the basis of serum <b>calcidiol</b> levels patients were classified as suffering from hormone insufficiency (< 30 ng/mL), deficiency (< 20 ng/mL) or severe deficiency (< 10 ng/mL).

40|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} is endemic worldwide. The Health Council of the Netherlands advises a colecalciferol {{intake of}} 800 IU/day and an intended serum level of <b>calcidiol</b> {{of at least}} 50 nmol/l for people aged 50 years and older and for osteoporosis patients. In 64 % of 626 fracture patients, we found a reduced serum <b>calcidiol</b> level according to this definition. According to calculations based on meta-analyses, a substantial proportion of fracture patients would not achieve the target <b>calcidiol</b> level of 50 nmol/l with a vitamin D supplement of 800 IU/day. For example, {{this would be the}} case in 37 % of elderly patients with osteoporosis. Until the results of a prospective study on this are published, we propose that fracture patients are either systematically given doses of vitamin D supplements higher than 800 IU/day, or that their serum <b>calcidiol</b> is measured and the dose of vitamin D supplements is adjusted according to this initial value and the desired serum concentrations, and that the measurement is repeated after 3 months so that the dosage can be adjusted if necessary...|$|E
40|$|The <b>calcidiol</b> (25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3) 24 -hydroxylase {{is one of}} the key enzymes in the {{metabolism}} {{of vitamin}} D.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a {{major problem}} in the Western world, with {{increasing}} prevalence and incidence. Because HF cannot be cured, prevention of HF is of utter importance. <b>Calcidiol,</b> calcitriol, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) have been identified as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, their association with new onset HF remains to be established. We investigated whether <b>calcidiol,</b> calcitriol, and PTH could be used to identify those subjects at risk for new onset HF, and if they had additive predictive value over established risk predictors like N-terminal-pro Brain-type natriuretic peptide and highly sensitive Troponin-T. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 7470 HF-free participants in Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease, a community-based cohort study in Groningen, the Netherlands (latitude 53 °N, mean age: 49 [*]years, 48 % male). During follow-up time of 12. 6 [*]years (interquartile range: 12. 3 - 12. 9), 281 participants (4 %) developed HF: 181 (66 %) HF with reduced and 94 (34 %) HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF [left ventricular ejection fraction[*]≤[*] 40 %], and HFpEF [left ventricular ejection fraction[*]≥[*] 50 %], respectively). Mean (±SD) of <b>calcidiol</b> was 58 (± 24) [*]nmol/L, mean calcitriol 145 (± 48) [*]pmol/L, and median (interquartile range) PTH was 3. 7 (3. 0 - 4. 6) [*]pmol/L. <b>Calcidiol</b> levels were univariately associated with new onset HF [hazard ratio (HR) 0. 82 (95 % CI 0. 69 - 0. 96) ], but calcitriol levels were not [HR 0. 85 (95 % CI 0. 71 - 1. 03) ]. PTH levels kept their predictive value after adjustment for age, sex, and day of blood withdrawal (HR 1. 26 [95 % CI 1. 04 - 1. 53]).

40|$|Hypertension is a {{key factor}} in the {{progression}} of cardiovascular diseases, and vitamin D is now recognised as a significant factor affecting blood pressure. Low serum concentrations of <b>calcidiol</b> {{may be related to the}} pathogenesis and progression of hypertension. The effect of both <b>calcidiol</b> and calcitriol on the proliferation and gene expression of HUVECs and on the subsequent proteins produced, secreted, or regulated by endothelial cells is investigated. This was followed by studies on the thoracic and abdominal segments of aortas isolated from adult female Wistar rats to determine direct vasomodulatory effects of calcitriol using a wire myograph system. The result showed that calcitriol (10 - 13 M) significantly enhanced the proliferation of HUVECs whereas a relatively high concentration of <b>calcidiol</b> (10 - 9, 10 - 7 M) significantly inhibited cell proliferation after the same incubation period: 24 and 48 hours. <b>Calcidiol</b> had the greatest effect on the expression of genes, particularly those involved in regulating blood pressure, with decreased ET- 1 mRNA expression, and there was a significant increase in eNOS mRNA relative to the control, particularly with 10 - 11 M of <b>calcidiol.</b> However, calcitriol had little effect on the expression of these genes so its effects on blood vessels may relate to non-genomic mechanisms. Ex vivo studies have shown that calcitriol acutely reduced endothelium-independent contraction in rat thoracic and abdominal aortas and does not involve NO. The acute effect of calcitriol reduced or inhibited the dose-dependent (10 – 9 to 10 – 5 M) contractions induced by PE, and there was a significant inhibition of the subsequent dose-dependent (10 – 9 to 10 – 5 M) relaxation induced by acetylcholine. The acute vasorelaxant effects of calcitriol do not appear to be mediated via the AC-cAMP-PKA signalling pathway but were similar to the effects of the Ca 2 + channel blocker, verapamil. In summary, this thesis reports novel information regarding the effect of calcitriol on regulation of vascular tone through enhancement of a potential relaxation of arteries in an endothelium-independent manner, which is mediated by a non-genomic mechanism. Future studies need to confirm these results with in vivo studies. Hence, inducing relaxation in smooth muscle cells ex vivo may facilitate to use calcitriol as an antihypertensive drug...|$|E
40|$|Late-onset {{hypogonadism}} {{is defined}} as a combination of low testosterone (T) levels and typical symptoms and signs. A major area of uncertainty is whether T concentrations are always really sufficient to fully reflect Leydig cell (dys) function. Mild testicular alteration could be diagnosed only by additional biochemical markers, such as luteinizing hormone (LH) and 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels. These markers help in identifying the so-called "subclinical" hypogonadism (normal T, high LH levels). Patients with hypogonadism have frequently low levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D due to impairment of the hydroxylating enzyme CYP 2 R 1 in the testis. However, no data have been published dealing with the best treatment option (cholecalciferol - the Vitamin D precursor, or <b>calcidiol</b> - 25 -hydroxylated form of Vitamin D) in these patients. We studied 66 patients with classic hypogonadism (total T [TT] < 12 nmol l- 1, LH ≥ 8 IU l- 1) (n = 26) and subclinical hypogonadism (TT ≥ 12 nmol l- 1, LH ≥ 8 IU l- 1) (n = 40) and low 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (< 50 nmol l- 1). Subjects received cholecalciferol (5000 IU per week) (n = 20) or <b>calcidiol</b> (4000 IU per week) (n = 46), and 25 -hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were evaluated after 3 months of therapy. Supplementation with <b>calcidiol</b> significantly increased 25 -hydroxyvitamin D and significantly decreased PTH levels in both groups of men with hypogonadism (primary, n = 16 and subclinical, n = 30), whereas supplementation with cholecalciferol did not modify their levels. This study shows {{for the first time that}} the administration of the 25 -hydroxylated form of Vitamin D (<b>calcidiol),</b> and not the administration of the precursor cholecalciferol, restores 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels in subjects with hypogonadism...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D designates a {{group of}} calcitriols, fatsolu ble hormones of {{secosteroid}} nature [13]. The calcitriols include vitamins D 2, D 3, D 4, D 5, and their derivatives [3]. Vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) synthesized in skin during photolysis of 7 dehydrocholesterol or ingested with food {{is the most important}} [1, 4]. Vitamin D 3 itself is biologi cally inert, and its bioactivation involves double hydroxy lation in liver (yielding prohormone <b>calcidiol)</b> followed by subsequent formation of calcitriol (figure) [46]. Calcitriol is the main biologically active form of vita min D 3. Together with <b>calcidiol,</b> vitamin D 3 circulates in blood as complexes with vitamin Dbinding protein, albumin, αfetoprotein, and lipoproteins [1, 3, 7, 8]. Physiological concentrations of calcitriol and calcid iol vary within 50100 pM and 3050 nM, respectively [8...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the dependency of incidence rates and prognosis of breast-prostate,-colon-, lung cancer and Hodgink lymphoma on the season of diagnosis. The incidence rates were constant throughout the year while the prognosis was best for cases diagnosed in summer and autumn. The advantage of summer and autumn diagnosis was largest for the youngest patients and slightly larger in the south than {{in the north of}} the country. A recent report from the UK is in full agreement with our work. We also determined the serum <b>calcidiol</b> level in persons hospitalized for a number of non – cancerous diseases, and found a seasonal variation, with highest summer levels. Other investigations in Scandinavia and {{in a number of other}} countries agree with our findings. We tentatively relate cancer prognosis with the <b>calcidiol</b> level in serum at diagnosis and therapy start...|$|E
40|$|Twenty of 22 {{consecutive}} British {{patients with}} crush fracture osteoporosis had transiliac bone biopsies following double in vivo tetracycline labeling synchronized with {{the collection of}} serum for the measurement of vitamin D metabolites. A significant but direct (rather than inverse) relationship was found between 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (<b>calcidiol)</b> levels and the fraction of cancellous surfaces covered with osteoid not taking either tetracycline label (r = 0. 53, P less than 0. 02). There was no correlation with 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D levels. No patient had frankly thickened osteoid seams although 3 had reduced but measurable <b>calcidiol</b> levels. These results make it unlikely {{that the majority of}} patients with osteoporosis who have osteoid of normal thickness but reduced uptake of tetracycline have a mineralization defect secondary to vitamin D deficiency. The pathophysiological significance of unlabeled osteoid in osteoporosis requires further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Approximately {{one-third of}} {{vertebral}} fractures can be clinically diagnosed. Aim: To study {{the frequency of}} vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women. Patients and methods: We recruited 555 postmenopausal women from Santiago, Chile, aged 55 - 84 years, who manifested interest in their bone health. All were healthy by self-declaration and by general clinical and laboratory tests and had not taken any bone-active therapy. They all underwent a spine and femoral neck (FN) densitometry and a digital lateral spine X-ray from T 4 to L 4 was obtained. PTH, <b>calcidiol,</b> and other parameters of calcium metabolism were also measured. Results: Overall, 142 of 478 patients with a complete study (29. 7 %) {{had at least one}} vertebral fracture. The proportion of women with fractures increased with age. A T score below - 2. 5 in the spine and hip was found in 32 % and 14 % of women, respectively. The proportion of women with spinal opeoporosis doubled between ages 55 - 70 and remained constant afterwards. In contrast, at the femoral neck, this proportion increased progressively reaching 53. 3 % at age 80 - 85. However, 56 % of patients with vertebral fractures did not have densitometric osteoporosis in any location. <b>Calcidiol</b> levels were 16. 8 ± 6. 8 ng/mL. With a cutoff point of 17 ng/mL, 47. 5 % of the patients had hypovitaminosis D. There was no association between <b>calcidiol</b> levels and vertebral fractures or bone density at the spine or femoral neck. Patients with fractures differed from those without fractures in that they had significantly lower bone density at the spine and hip and were older (p < 0. 001). However they did not differ in weight, body mass index, or <b>calcidiol</b> levels. Conclusions: Thirty percent of postmenopausal women in this series had a vertebral fractures. Osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency were also common. Most vertebral fractures were observed in women without osteoporosis by densitometric criteri...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D is {{recognized}} as a potent immunosuppressive drug. The suppressive effects of vitamin D are attributed to its physiologically active metabolite 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (calcitriol), which was shown, to prime dendritic cells (DCs) to promote the development of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Despite the potential benefit in treating autoimmune diseases, clinical application of calcitriol is hindered by deleterious side effects manifested by hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. Conversely, the physiological precursors of calcitriol, vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) and its first metabolite 25 -hydroxy vitamin D 3 (<b>calcidiol)</b> are widely applied in the clinic due to their low calcimic burden. However, the mechanisms by which cholecalciferol and <b>calcidiol</b> may modulate adaptive immunity remain elusive. This prompted us to unravel the immunosuppressive capacity of these precursors by assessing their influence on DC functions and the subsequent polarization of naive CD 4 (+) T cells. In this study we show that, whereas cholecalciferol has insignificant effects on DC maturation and cytokine production, it only weakly primed DCs to induce suppressive T cells. However, like calcitriol, <b>calcidiol</b> not only exerted an inhibitory effect on DC maturation and cytokine production, and primed DCs to promote the development of suppressive IL- 10 -producing Treg cells. Strikingly, {{in contrast to the}} population of IL- 10 -producing Treg cells induced by calcitriol-primed DCs, the IL- 10 -producing Treg cells induced by calcidiol-primed DCs exhibited sustained IFN-gamma production in face of their suppressive capacity. Experiments with the steroid synthesis inhibitor ketoconazole indicated that the immunomodulatory features of the precursors are dependent on their conversion into calcitriol. Collectively, <b>calcidiol</b> is a potent immune modulator, which may be more adequate than calcitriol for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, since it is less hypercalcimic. This may be of particular interest for the treatment of allergic disease, where concurrent suppression and sustained IFN-gamma production by Treg cells effectively counterbalance the Th 2 -dominated immune responses...|$|E
40|$|Summary: A fully {{automated}} technique for the extraction and clean-up of low-molecular weight analytes from human serum and urine is presented. Its efficiency for sample clean-up prior to immunological assay is demonstrated for six adrenal and gonadal steroid hormones, <b>calcidiol</b> and the peptide hormones gastrin, insulin and glucagon. A more intensive sample clean-up, which is mandatory for liquid Chromatographie analysis, is reported for serum Cortisol. With {{the exception of}} <b>calcidiol,</b> the extraction of steroids is almost complete. Recovery of peptides is about 80 % and depends {{on the nature of}} the peptide and on protein-analyte dissociating diluents. Precision of recovery is lower than 7 % (CV) for all analytes studied. One hundred serum or urine samples can be cleaned up without loss of efficiency by only one solid-phase cartridge. The technique is in principle applicable to all other analytes with physico-chemical structures similar to the analytes in the present study...|$|E
