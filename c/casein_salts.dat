50|$|The {{interactions}} between proteins and carbohydrates {{plays an important}} role in the viscosity of processed spreads. More specifically, sodium alginate contributes to the integrity of the gel-like network formed by the <b>casein</b> and <b>salts.</b> The newly formed network is made possible through cation binding, which converts the hydrophilic sodium alginate into hydrophobic calcium alginate (Ma). Guluronic acid residues that are linked together demonstrate a high affinity for calcium ions. Sodium alginate works in conjunction with the destabilization of the casein micelle where calcium ions can interact with guluronic chains (Ma). Due to a mixture of these interactions, a gel-like structure is formed rather than a true gel structure.|$|R

40|$|The {{predominant}} cAMP-independent casein kinase CS {{isolated from}} human erythrocyte hemolysate and membrane casein kinase MS are inhibited {{to the same}} extent by 2, 3 -bisphosphoglycerate (2, 3 -DPG). However, under some conditions, both enzymes may appear to be unaffected or even stimulated by this prominent red cell metabolite, depending on <b>casein</b> and monovalent <b>salt</b> (NaCl, KCl) concentrations employed in the assay. In addition, both casein kinases CS and MS exhibit identical response to heparin, being unaffected by increasing concentrations of this mucopolysaccharide up to 400 ng/ml.

40|$|The radiation-chemical {{changes in}} {{proteins}} depend strongly on irradiation conditions. Therefore, irradiation treatment can considerably increase the cohesive strength of proteins by {{the formation of}} cross-links. However, above a certain dose, the irradiation stops inducing cross-links and has the opposite effect on the protein structure (softer and considerable loss of cohesiveness). Therefore, {{it is very important}} to optimize the use of indicators such as TMA-N and TVB-N, TMA, and TBARs, in conjunction with sensory assessment, to ensure that irradiation treatment induces the desired results per case. Most of the research to date has been carried out mainly on proteins of animal origin, such as meat (collagen, gelatin, and globulin), chicken, egg and dairy proteins (<b>casein</b> caseinate <b>salts),</b> and, to a lesser extent, on proteins of plant origin irradiated for disinfestation purposes and improvement of physical properties by means of cross-linking. Both TVB-N and TMA-N of γ-irradiated fish increased substantially with long storage time. The latter is a very important factor that will have to be taken into account because in most cases, the previously mentioned indicators could be used to provide an indication of how long after the irradiation treatment the detection of the irradiated proteins is feasible. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|A semicontinuous {{culture of}} the {{microbial}} community of the human large intestine that was maintained over 81 days is described. The initial inoculum was feces, and about 200 ml of nutrient suspension was fed to 500 ml of fermentor contents once or twice daily. The nutrient suspension contained comminuted fibrous food, sodium deoxycholate, urea, acid-hydrolyzed <b>casein,</b> vitamins, and <b>salts.</b> The fermentation was monitored, and the major products were acetate, propionate, butyrate, methane, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. The concentration of anaerobic bacteria was 2 X 10 (9) per ml of culture contents and was 100 times that of fecal coliforms. When the nutrient suspension contained lettuce, celery, carrots, and unsweetened applesauce, the predominant nonsporeforming anaerobes isolated were Bacteroides species. When carrots and applesauce were omitted, the predominant nonsporeforming isolates were Fusobacterium species. On both diets, clostridia were isolated that resembled Clostridium clostridiiforme.

40|$|Fast {{freezing}} and slow thawing Salmonella anatum cells in various milk components inactivated from 20 to 98 % {{of the cells}} and damaged 40 to 90 % of the cells surviving the treatments. Injured cells failed to form colonies on a selective medium (xylose-lysine-peptone agar with 0. 2 % sodium deoxycholate) but did form colonies on a nonselective plating medium (xylose-lysine-peptone agar). The major milk components—lactose, milk <b>salts,</b> <b>casein,</b> and whey proteins—influenced the extent of injury, repair of injury, and death. The percentages of cells injured and inactivated were decreased {{by the presence of}} any milk components except whey proteins. Also, repair of injury was promoted by the presence of each milk component except whey proteins, which in contrast inhibited repair. Phosphate was the most influential milk salts component that protected the cells and promoted repair of injury.

40|$|For {{several years}} {{studies have been}} in {{progress}} in this laboratory on the relation of nutrition to resistance to virus infections of the central nervous system. The majority of the reports have involved experiments with mice, but a few have been with monkeys (Clark et al. 1945). In {{the case of the}} monkey, which requires certain known and unknown components of liver, it has been difficult to produce an uncomplicated deficiency. Thiamine deficiency has been studied by using sulfited liver extract which served as a source of unknown factors. Other work here has shown that a "folic acid " deficiency developed rapidly when our basal synthetic diet was fed along with the synthetic vitamins (Wais-man and Elvehjem, 1943). We have therefore studied the possible relation of this deficiency to resistance to experimental poliomyelitis.

40|$|During {{the past}} 6 years, {{experiments}} {{have been reported}} from this laboratory on swine in which deficiencies in vitamins of the B complex have been produced. Of particular interest have been the studies {{on the relationship of}} vitamin deficiency to the integrity of nervous tissues.

Although the inclusion of nicotinic acid in this diet led to some improvement in growth, the nerve, ganglion cell, and spinal cord changes continued to appear (2). When other vitamins of the B group became available, it was shown that good growth could be obtained and neural lesions could be prevented if choline, pyridoxine, and pantothenic acid were added to the basal diet already supplemented with thiamin, riboflavin, and nicotinic acid (3).

40|$|The US dairy {{industry}} produces 67 billion pounds of cheese whey annually. A waste by-product of cheese production, whey consists of water, milk sugar (lactose), <b>casein</b> (protein), and <b>salts</b> amounting to about 7 % total solids. Ultrafiltration {{is used to}} concentrate cheese whey into a protein-rich foodstuff; however, it too produces a waste stream, known as ''whey permeate,'' (rejected water, lactose, and salts from the membrane). Whey permeate contains about 4. 5 % lactose and requires treatment to reduce the high BOD (biological oxygen demand) before disposal. Ab Initio, a small business with strong chemistry and dairy processing background, desired help in developing methods for bioconversion of whey permeate lactose into lactic acid. Lactic acid is an organic acid primarily used as an acidulant in the food industry. More recently {{it has been used}} to produce polylactic acid, a biodegradable polymer and as a new method to treat meat carcasses to combat E. coli bacteria. Conversion of whey permeate to lactic acid is environmentally sound because it produces a valued product from an otherwise waste stream. FM&T has expertise in bioconversion processes and analytical techniques necessary to characterize biomass functions. The necessary engineering and analytical services for pilot biomass monitoring, process development, and purification of crude lactic acid were available at this facility...|$|R

Therefore, high densities of Acinetobacter sp. to function in the bioremediation treatment are needed. The optimization of Acinetobacter sp. was carried out in shake flask for 24 hours cultivation using different carbon sources (glucose, sucrose, maltose, fructose and glycerol), nitrogen sources (yeast extract, soy powder, corn steep liquor, beef extract and peptone from <b>casein)</b> and phosphate <b>salts</b> (potassium monohydrogen phosphate). Total cell mass of 2. 14 g L- 1 was produced in un-optimized semi-defined medium using glucose as sole carbon source. Replacement of glucose with sucrose resulted in the 62. 60 % increase of cell mass production (3. 48 g L- 1). Yeast extract (20 g L- 1) was demonstrated as the best nitrogen source based on the 172. 89 % increase of cell mass (5. 84 g L- 1). Unfortunately, different concentration of phosphate salts did not show any differences in cell mass production. A combination of the optimized parameters resulted in 7. 59 g L- 1 of cell mass after 16 hours of cultivation. In conclusion, Acinetobacter sp. showed cell mass production rate of 0. 23 g L- 1 h- 1 under un-controlled pH compared to controlled pH (0. 12 g L- 1 h- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Bovine milk {{contains}} 3 - 4 % {{protein and}} almost 80 % of the milk protein fraction consist of four caseins; α s 1 -casein, β-casein, α s 2 -casein and κ-casein. Most of the caseins in milk are assembled in casein micelles, which consist of several thousands of individual <b>casein</b> molecules and <b>salts.</b> The unique structure of casein micelles allows {{the delivery of}} large amounts of calcium and phosphate to the neonate. Considerable natural variation in casein content and composition exists between milk samples from individual cows, however {{the impact of these}} variations on casein micelle structure and technological properties of dairy products are largely unknown. This study showed that the expression of caseins and their post-translational modification as well as inclusion of calcium in casein micelles are well-balanced processes. Analysis of the genetic background of phosphorylation of α s 1 -casein with eight or nine phosphate groupsshowed that α s 1 -casein phosphorylation was regulated by a different set of genes. Also, variation in α s 1 -casein phosphorylation resulted in changes in the core of casein micelles and was associated with a difference in degradation efficiency by chymosin in milk gels. Another post-translational modification, glycosylation of κ-casein, resulted in changes in the surface of casein micelles. Natural variation in α s 1 -CN phosphorylationand glycosylation of κ-casein are both relevant factors to consider for optimization of dairy products and the design of future breeding strategies...|$|R

Germ tubes began to appear 3 to 4 hr after exposure to air. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) precursors were incorporated into RNA in a discontinuous fashion during this conversion, but the incorporation was continuous during the anaerobic growth of yeastlike cells and during the aerobic germination of sporangiospores. The incorporation of labeled amino acids during the conversion was exponential. Labeling of ribosomal RNA occurred as shortly as 5 min after replacement of CO 2 -N 2 with air. However, P 32 -labeled RNA isolated 20 min after exposure to air had a guanine plus cytosine (GC) content of 41 % (mole%) {{as compared with the}} 47 % found for labeled and unlabeled RNA isolated at other stages of the life cycle of this organism or later during the conversion. In addition, the overall base composition of this 20 -min pulse-labeled RNA resembled that of deoxyribonucleic acid (GC = 39 %), suggesting that a significant proportion of this RNA is of the messenger type. Furthermore, the synthesis of cytochrome oxidase was induced upon exposure of yeastlike cells to air.
