500|$|After the Olympics, Windle {{enrolled}} at Indiana University—whose Indiana Hoosiers swimming team was coached by Doc Counsilman—on an athletic scholarship. He did so after getting advice from Australian teammate, Olympic gold medallist and Indiana student Kevin Berry. He studied business while {{competing for the}} university, where he switched his focus to shorter sprint distances. Windle did not enjoy as much success at short-course swimming in the United States {{as he did in}} long-course swimming. He cited the lack of enjoyment for switching to shorter distances, quipping [...] "Why swim 30 laps for a gold, when you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> for swimming two laps?" [...] However, Windle enjoyed his time in the United States, approving of the additional emphasis on relays and team spirit and the social life that it entailed. Windle also enjoyed learning from Counsilman, who was regarded as an expert in mechanics, resulting in an improvement in his swimming technique.|$|E
2500|$|The tour sported {{the same}} electric, {{over-the-top}} theatricality {{the band was}} known for during the Fever era. [...] "I really miss wearing costumes and makeup," [...] Urie told Spin. [...] "I love throwing a big production. I've recently been reading about Tesla coils and I'm {{trying to figure out}} how I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> that sits on the stage and shoots sparks without hurting anybody." ...|$|E
2500|$|English captain Mike Brearley {{attributed}} his team's {{success to}} {{its ability to}} get through the Australian batting order. [...] "The biggest problem is to break the opening pair. Rick Darling and Graeme Wood", he said. [...] "At times they have played very well, but we have found that once we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> of them cheaply {{we have been able to}} dismiss numbers three, four and five with the new ball." ...|$|E

5000|$|It {{is common}} to {{slightly}} bend the knee of the leg one is standing on when executing this kick, and pointing the foot one is standing on somewhat outwards. As in all Taekwondo kicks, one will also try to <b>get</b> <b>ones</b> [...] "hip into the kick", resulting perhaps in a slight shift of weight forward. In any case, this is a linear kick, and as such <b>one</b> that <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>ones</b> weight behind.|$|R
2500|$|The band began touring {{in support}} of the album, christened the Vices & Virtues Tour, in earnest {{beginning}} in February 2011. The tour has sported the same electric, over-the-top theatricality the band was known for during the Fever era. [...] "I really miss wearing costumes and makeup," [...] Urie told Spin. [...] "I love throwing a big production. I've recently been reading about Tesla coils and I'm {{trying to figure out how}} I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> that sits on the stage and shoots sparks without hurting anybody." [...] The group was scheduled to play the Australian Soundwave Revolution festival in September/October but the festival was canceled and in its place is the Counter-Revolution mini-festival the band will play.|$|E
2500|$|By the {{syndicated}} run, the storylines had clearly started to mature. Many more of Punky and Cherie's friends were seen (although most only made {{a handful of}} guest appearances each), with Margaux becoming their comic foil and source of friction. Early in the third season, Allen moved away to Kansas with his mother, following his parents' divorce. As Punky herself embarked on junior high, her avant-garde day-glo and multicolored attire, along with her pigtails, segued into more traditional teenage styles, and her declaration of, and reliance on [...] "Punky Power!" [...] {{gave way to the}} realization that intelligence, common sense and a strong will <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> out of any problem. More of her dalliances with boys entered the stories, with the ones she chased and those that tried to pursue her. Punky's spunk and vivacious attitude toward life did remain though, {{thanks in part to the}} sunshine brought in by the most important man in her life, her adoptive dad.|$|E
2500|$|Lee's new {{position}} represented a significant {{potential threat to}} Grant. By moving south of the river, Lee hoped that Grant would assume that he was retreating, leaving only a token force to prevent a crossing at Ox Ford. If Grant pursued, the pointed wedge of the inverted V would split his army. Lee could leave a force of about 7,000 on the western arm of the V to keep Warren and Wright pinned down, then launch an attack against Hancock on the eastern arm of the V, concentrating his force to achieve local superiority, about 36,000 Confederate to 20,000 Union. Warren and Wright could come to Hancock's support only by crossing over the North Anna twice, a time-consuming exercise. As Lee had achieved at Spotsylvania Court House (and Meade at Gettysburg), interior lines {{could be used as}} a force multiplier; unlike the [...] "Mule Shoe" [...] at Spotsylvania, however, this position had the advantage of a strong anchor at the apex (the bluffs above Ox Ford), dissuading any attack from that direction. Lee confided to a local physician, [...] "If I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> more pull at , I will defeat him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Owner Tom Gerun {{contracted}} {{for several}} more show runs with Sophie Tucker through the 1940s. The club put on two floor shows a night, one at 9 or 9:30 and one starting around midnight. Gerun took the show some [...] south to Fort Ord to entertain U.S. Army troops for a special engagement in August 1941. Other bands {{taking part in the}} show were Carl Ravazza and his Palace Hotel Band, and Robert Nurok and his band from the Alcazar nightclub. Coming from the Bal Tabarin were Bob Saunders and his band, Señor Wences (a ventriloquist), singer-actress Gertrude Niesen, and the Duncan Sisters with their vaudeville act. After World War II started in earnest for the United States, Martinelli joked with a Billboard reporter that it was easy to get big-name stars to perform at his club, but asked [...] "can you tell me where I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> waiter and two dishwashers? Those are the rare birds these days." [...] After the war, Gerun hosted NBC broadcasts of Ted Lewis and his band, announced by Bill Roddy, performed live from the nightclub's stage. This activity was not enough to keep the club solvent—in 1947 Billboard reported their doors shut for a time so that the owners could save money as they attempted to sign a major musical artist. Gerun and Martinelli also admitted they were seeking a buyer for the place.|$|E
