50|$|A gradual {{technological}} development {{has taken place}} in ceramic armour: ceramic tiles, in themselves vulnerable to low energy impacts, were first reinforced by glueing them to a backplate; in the nineties their resistance was increased by bringing them under compression on two axes; in the final phase a third <b>compression</b> <b>axis</b> was added to optimise impact resistance. To confine the ceramic core several advanced techniques are used, supplementing the traditional machining and welding, including sintering the suspension material around the core; squeeze casting of molten metal around the core and spraying the molten metal onto the ceramic tile.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} eighties, Rosakis {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} [...] "laboratory earthquakes" [...] and since then his research interests have mainly focused on the mechanics of seismology, the physics of dynamic shear rupture and frictional sliding and on laboratory seismology. The goal of this body of work is to create, in a controlled and repeatable environment, surrogate laboratory earthquake scenarios mimicking various dynamic shear rupture process occurring in natural earthquake events. Such, highly instrumented, experiments are used to observe new physical phenomena and to also create benchmark comparisons with existing analysis and field observations. The experiments use high-speed photography, full-field photoelasticity, and laser velocimetry as diagnostics. The fault systems are simulated using two photoelastic plates held together in frictional contact. The far field tectonic loading is simulated by pre-compression while the triggering of dynamic rupture (spontaneous nucleation) is achieved by suddenly dropping the normal stress in a small region along the interface. The frictional interface (fault) forms various angles with the <b>compression</b> <b>axis</b> to provide the shear driving force necessary for continued rupturing. Rosakis and his co-workers, investigate the characteristics of rupture, such as rupture speed, rupture mode, associated ground motion under various conditions such as tectonic load, interface complexity and roughness. Both homogeneous and bimaterial interfaces (abutted by various elastic and damaged media) are investigated. Rosakis and his coworkers have been credited with the experimental discovery of the [...] "intersonic" [...] or [...] "supershear rupture" [...] phenomenon. They also have investigated this new phenomenon in various engineering and geophysical settings involving shear dominated rupture {{in the presence of}} weak interfaces or faults. Their experimental discoveries of supershear rupture has refocused the attention of the geophysics community to the study of supershear earthquakes.|$|E

A major advantage in custom designing {{is the ability}} to create structures with desired mechanical properties. While the behaviour of a designed scaffold can be simulated using bulk material properties, it is important to verify the behaviour of a printed scaffold at the microstructure level. OBJECTIVE: In this study we present an effective method in validating the mechanical behaviour of designed scaffolds using a μCT with an in-situ mechanical deformation device. METHODS: The scaffolds were prepared from biodegradable poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) by stereolithography and images obtained using a high-resolution μCT with 12. 25 μm isometric voxels. The data was processed (filtering, segmentation) and analysed (surface generation, registration) to extract relevant deformation features. RESULTS: The computed local deformation fields, calculated at sub-pore resolutions, displayed expected linear behaviour within the scaffold along the <b>compressions</b> <b>axis.</b> On planes perpendicular to this axis, the deformations varied by 150 – 200 μm. CONCLUSIONS: μCT based imaging with in-situ deformation provides a vital tool in validating the design parameters of printed scaffolds.

However, Mn–Zn ferrites obtained by the standard process flow (ITS) have texture along the pressing axis which significantly reduces their permeability and causes anisotropic properties. The difference in the magnetic permeability along and perpendicular to the pressing axis reaches 10 – 20 % due to the texture. The texture of the raw blanks is caused by lamellar ferrite particles [1] and {{the orientation of the}} [1   1   1] crystallographic axes along the <b>compression</b> <b>axis.</b> During sintering the degree of texture increases due to the preferential growth of pressing-oriented particles at the expense of non-oriented ones.

Moreover, the indirect tensile test, uniaxial <b>compression</b> test, three <b>axis</b> <b>compression</b> experiment and AE test are carried out by using RMT- 150 C mechanics experiment system with DS 5 - 8 B AE test system. The experiment results indicate that the main framework particles of sandstone are quartz and feldspar, and mainly quartz.

The tensile strength, compressive strength and elastic modulus of sandstone are 4.825, 85.313  MPa, 13.814  GPa, respectively, so the sandstone belongs to hard rock.

3000|$|Ti-rich {{lamellar}} alloys {{exhibit a}} significant plastic anisotropy {{whether they are}} polysynthetically twinned (PST) or polycrystalline intermetallics. Anisotropy of Ti-rich side alloys is highly pronounced irrespective of whether it is at room temperature ([...] Werwer and Cornec 2006) or at high temperature ([...] Wegmann et al. 2000). Room temperature plastic anisotropy of similar Ti-rich TiAl lamellar single crystals has also been discussed in Zambaldi et al. (2011), Zambaldi and Raabe (2010), and among others, where they showed that the maximum yield stress occurs when lamellar direction is perpendicular to the <b>compression</b> <b>axis</b> i.e ϕ= 90 °, stress is the minimum when approximately ϕ= 45 °, and at ϕ= 0 ° stress is in between (Brockman 2003, Fujiwara et al. 1990). The ratio of the highest to the lowest values of yield stress is almost 8 : 1. This large difference in yield stress {{has been found to}} be related to the difference in the deformation modes. For compression either perpendicular or parallel to the twin boundaries, shear deformation always occurs across them, while compression at an intermediate angle, shear deformation is parallel to the boundaries ([...] Fujiwara et al. 1990). This means, deformation behavior depends strongly on the angle between the lamellar/twin boundary and <b>compression</b> <b>axis</b> rather than on the crystallographic orientation of the <b>compression</b> <b>axis.</b> So the plastic anisotropy of two-phase lamellar alloys or PST crystal is mainly a morphological anisotropy. This kind of anisotropy of TiAl single crystals is associated with the difference in the deformation mode e.g. shear deformation modes are different depending on ϕ. Anisotropy is coming from to the asymmetric core spreading of the < 101] superdislocations that occur in the L 10 structure of γ-TiAl. The coupling of partial dislocations by different planar faults (that are specific for the L 10 structure) makes the resistance to slip and cross slip of the < 101] superdislocation sensitive to its direction of motion.|$|E
