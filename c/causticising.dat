40|$|This licentiate {{thesis is}} based on two papers, a {{comparative}} LCA case study paper and a paper on energy issues in LCA. A case study was done in order to investigate which of two compared technologies for chemical recovery in the pulp industry (recovery boiler, RB, or black liquor gasification, BLG) is environmentally favourable. The chemical recovery processes by themselves are not the dominant contributors to the life cycle environmental effects. Instead, the production chains of the chemical and energy inputs to the processes dominate. An analys{{is based on}} current LCIA environmental performance indices gives an unequivocal answer to the main question, although {{the strength of the}} answer varies between different impact assessment methods. However, the BLG process is better for the environment. If the BLG process would switch from oil to biofuel in its <b>causticising</b> plant, it would become clearly superior. The energy paper analyses and elucidates some problems with the way energy is treated in LCA methodology. For most products and production processes, several quite different forms of energy are involved in different stages in the life cycle. There is no indisputable general method for comparing and aggregating these energy forms when performing an LCI, nor is there any general method for the valuation needed for the weighting in an LCIA. Some possibilities for and limitations on resolving these problems are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Degree thesis Solid {{content in}} Lime Mud By Andre Flodin Process {{operator}} program – Umeå University 17 / 6 – 2014 Pages: 21 A thesis {{was made on}} Billerudkorsnäs production unit in Karlsborg where lime kiln in the <b>causticising</b> department of chemical recovery plant {{does not meet the}} required production. <b>Causticising</b> department is the final step in the chemical recycling unit. There, the filtered green liquor is mixed with lime to recover the cooking chemicals used in the pulp factory. The cooking liquid is called white liquor. As a residue from the recycling of the white liquor you get lime mud, calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is recovered in the lime recycling department to reduce the need to buy lime to the factory, thus saving money. By first washing the lime mud in the lime filter and then burning it in the lime kiln. In order to increase production through the furnace better washed lime mud which means higher solid content and so little residual alkali as possible is sought. In order to increase the dry content and reduce the residual alkali in the lime mud examinations are made on one of the lime filters by means of multivariate experimental design. This is a great tool for examining whether there are interaction effects between different factors in an effective manner. The experimental design on the lime filter examines three different parameters, density of incoming lime mud flow, speed of the filter and wash water flow to the filter. Through the variation of these three variables in a calculated pattern an optimum can be obtained. There are other factors that will affect the dry matter content and residual alkali but these are not considered to affect as much. Two attempts were made, a test experiment and a main experiment. The test experiment was made to check how well the sampling and analytical methods work. Smaller version of the experimental design was used and the results are not considered to be reliable enough to be used for optimizing the process. It was however discovered some problems. The wash water flow to the filter was not stable and no compensation was made on the lime mud flow in relation to density. For the main experiment, the design CCF - Central Composite Face Centered with three center points was used, to determine the variation between samples. Before the trial started a second wash water pump was started and during the experiment compensation was made to the lime mud flow against density. With the obtained results on the center points, the variation between them made the experiment unreliable. This may be due to several reasons. When the results are not considered reliable, it is hard to make any conclusions about how the filter should be set for maximum dryness or residual alkali. But it is possible to discern that certain factors influence more than others, wash water flow and speed of the filter seems to affect the dry matter content the most...|$|E
40|$|The {{flocculation}} of kaolinite using {{natural polymer}} was investigated between pH range of 3. 5 – 10. 71 using <b>causticised</b> cassava starch {{as the natural}} polymer. The sample was characterized using X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Results revealed that the settling rates increased {{as a function of}} flocculant dosage up to a maximum settling rate before decreasing at high flocculant dosages. Settling rates produced by natural polymer decreased with increasing pH. The flocculant, displayed an initial increase in floc size up to the optimum dosage before decreasing with increasing flocculant dosages while the bed height decreased with increasing pH.

40|$|Tencel, a {{regenerated}} {{cellulosic fibre}} is synthesised by an environmental friendly process. It can be dyed {{by the same}} dye types as recommended for other cellulosic fibres. The behaviour of reactive dyes on Tencel woven fabric varies with the type and the density of woven fabric. The highly crystalline Tencel fibre is less easy to dye uniformly by the continuous dyeing methods because of the short time of contact between the dye and fibre. The purpose of this work is to investigate the influences of weave structure on dyeing of standard Tencel fabric using reactive dyes applied by continuous dyeing methods. Programmes are developed using Matlab software to measure the fabric porosity and uniformity of fibre coloration (UFC) in the yarns of the woven fabric. UFC is also measured subjectively. Firstly, fabrics of four different weave structures (plain, 2 / 1, 3 / 1, 5 / 1 twill fabric) are studied. The visual depth and UFC standard deviation values is highest for the 2 / 1 twill fabric, gradually reducing towards the 5 / 1 twill fabric. Secondly, nine plain weave fabrics of different fabric densities are dyed using different padding procedures - a liquor temperature of 40 ⁰C with a 1 min dwell time and with a 5 min dwell time, and liquor at room temperature without any dwell time. The padded fabrics are then fixed by pad-steam, pad-dry-steam, pad-batch and pad-dry-thermosol continuous dyeing processes. To improve colour depth the plain weave fabrics are given a caustic pre-treatment and their dyeing characteristics are compared with untreated fabrics. The <b>causticised</b> fabrics are dyed using the same padding procedures, for comparison. The optimum dyeing procedure {{is found to be}} padding with a dwell time of 1 min in liquor at 40 ⁰C after caustic pre-treatment to achieve the highest visual depth, dye uptake, and uniformity of fibre coloration. The fibrillation tendency of the Tencel plain weave fabrics is also reduced using this procedure. Numerical relationships are established to enable the prediction of dyeing properties such as colour strength, UFC for fabrics of different weave structures, applied by the various continuous dyeing processes.
