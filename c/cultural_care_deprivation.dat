Four categories emerged: characterization of family caregivers of elders with Alzheimer's disease, knowledge about the disease {{to the practice of}} caring for the family, the meaning to take proper care provided by family caregivers of seniors with Alzheimer's disease and care for elderly people with Alzheimer's disease. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of the nurse's role as mediator in the relationship between the elderly, family and health team, as well as the relevance of the application of <b>cultural</b> <b>care</b> in the exercise of this mediation.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the {{development}} of a <b>cultural</b> <b>care</b> framework that seeks to inform and embrace the philosophical ideals of caring science. Following a review of the literature that identified a lack of evidence of an explicit relationship between <b>caring</b> science and <b>cultural</b> <b>care,</b> a number of well-established transcultural care frameworks were reviewed. Our purpose was to select one that would resonate with underpinning philosophical values of caring science and that drew on criteria generated by the European Academy of Caring Science members. A modified framework based on the work of Giger and Davidhizar was developed as it embraced many of the values such as humanism that are core to caring science practice.

40|$|Aims and objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the social {{construction}} of cultural issues in palliative care amongst oncology nurses. [...] Background: Australia is a nation composed of people from different cultural origins with diverse linguistic, spiritual, religious and social backgrounds. The challenge of working with an increasingly culturally diverse population is a common theme expressed by many healthcare professionals from a variety of countries. [...] Design: Grounded theory was used to investigate the processes by which nurses provide nursing care to cancer patients from diverse cultural backgrounds. [...] Methods: Semi-structured interviews with seven Australian oncology nurses provided the data for the study; the data was analysed using grounded theory data analysis techniques. [...] Results: The core category emerging from the study was that of accommodating cultural needs. This paper focuses on describing the series of subcategories that were identified as factors which could influence the process by which nurses would accommodate cultural needs. These factors included nurses' views and understandings of culture and cultural mores, their philosophy of <b>cultural</b> <b>care,</b> nurses' previous experiences with people from other cultures and organisational approaches to culture and <b>cultural</b> <b>care.</b> [...] Conclusions: This study demonstrated that previous experiences with people from other cultures and organisational approaches to culture and <b>cultural</b> <b>care</b> often influenced nurses' views and understandings of culture and cultural mores and their beliefs, attitudes and behaviours in providing <b>cultural</b> <b>care.</b> [...] Relevance to clinical practice: It is imperative to appreciate how nurses' experiences with people from other cultures can be recognised and built upon or, if necessary, challenged. Furthermore, nurses' cultural competence and experiences with people from other cultures need to be further investigated in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Culture, {{diversity}} and <b>cultural</b> <b>care</b> have become important concepts for nurses professionals. However, {{little is known}} about how nursing students come to understand these complex concepts. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore what nursing students learn and understand about diversity, culture and cultural encounters from a nursing education perspective. A qualitative approach utilizing the focused ethnography method guided this research study. The study population was first and fourth year undergraduate nursing students enrolled in a Western Canadian university. Findings revealed that the majority of first and fourth year students supported expanded essentialist views of culture. Although students demonstrated increased knowledge of nursing practice, the overall understanding of culture care changed very little between first and fourth year students.

The data was categorized and analyzed based on the Theory of Diversity and Universality of <b>Cultural</b> <b>Care.</b> Findings: It was found that sexual minorities have encountered prejudiced and discriminatory professional practices in health care as a result of heteronormative cultural representations, which reflect difficulties in accessibility to the services. The exclusionary <b>cultural</b> <b>care</b> results in poor self-care and linked to sexually transmitted di-seases, low attendance and distance of health services for gay and bisexual men.

Scheck was hired and paid for by her employer EF Education First's <b>Cultural</b> <b>Care</b> Au Pair. As part of the defense strategy, her attorneys requested that the jury not be given the option of convicting her of manslaughter (a lesser included offense), and instead either convict her of murder or find her not guilty. When personally questioned about this decision by the judge, she agreed with her lawyers. Legal experts speculated that the motivation for this strategy was to help EF Education First avoid a civil lawsuit from the Eappens. EF's screening process and training for au pairs had come under scrutiny; she had only received three days of training. If the death had been pre-meditated then under Massachusetts law EF Education First could not be held responsible.

40|$|M. Cur. (Intensive General Nursing) Knowledge and {{technological}} advancement {{in the field}} of transplantation has increased the demand for organ donation. However, the supply of organs does not meet this demand, especially, among the black communities. Literature reviewed associate this imbalance with the few sources of organs, the technique of organ retrieval, discrepancies in the allocation of organs and sociocultural factors. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the extent to which the Zulu cultural norms and social structural dimensions influence an individual's decision to donate an organ or to undergo a transplantation, based on the theoretical assumptions of Leininger and Chrisman. A qualitative approach using an ethno- nursing method was selected, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the transplant co-ordinator representing the professional sector, the religious leaders and traditional healers representing the folk sector and the general public representing the popular sector of the health care system. The respondents were extracted from both the urban and rural settings. The conclusions arrived at were that there is lack of knowledge among the Zulu speaking people on organ donation and transplantation, related mainly to misconceptions associated with their life patterns, beliefs about death, burial and life hereafter, values and social structural dimensions. The recommendations with regard to the promotion of organ donation and transplantation among the Zulu speaking people were made based on culture sensitive and culture congruent principles, namely: • <b>Cultural</b> <b>care</b> preservative or maintenance such as ancestor worship, extended families etc. • <b>Cultural</b> <b>care</b> accommodation or negotiation such as their knowledge of anatomy and physiology of the human body especially the transplantable organs and their fear to discuss death, etc. • <b>Cultural</b> <b>care</b> repatterning and restructuring such as culture sensitive educational campaigns to dispel the fears and correct misconceptions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to the measurement of inequality and inequity in the delivery of health care based on contributions from the literature on poverty and deprivation. This approach has some appealing characteristics: (1) inequity is additively decomposable by population subgroups; (2) the approach does not rely on socio-economic ranks; (3) it provides a graphical representation of the distribution of inequity; (4) it offers a range of indices consistent with dominance. An empirical application is provided investigating the effect of the GP fundholding reform on equity in English NHS. The results show that the most equitable GP practices self-selected into the scheme in 1991; evidence of an inequity-reducing treatment effect as well as a self-selection effect are found in 1992 and 1993; the self-selection process reduces and no evidence of a treatment effect is present thereafter.
