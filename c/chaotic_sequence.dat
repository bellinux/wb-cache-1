40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} Frequency Hopped Spread Spectrum (FHSS) {{communication}} system using chaos. The spread spectrum technique of frequency hopping uses pseudorandom number (PN) generator {{to produce a}} random sequence of frequencies. In multiple access applications, it is desirable to employ sets of frequency hopping sequences that have good Hamming correlation properties, large period and also large linear span. Most algebraic designs for frequency hopping sequences are based either on PN sequences or else on Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. These sequences having short linear span are potentially weak when the threat of intelligent jamming exists. A new class of signature sequences for use in Frequency Hopped Spread Spectrum communication systems is proposed. In arriving at these sequences, the theory of chaos has been used. The correlation properties of these <b>chaotic</b> <b>sequences</b> are similar to random white noise. The numbers and lengths of <b>chaotic</b> <b>sequences</b> are not restricted like m sequences. The performances of <b>chaotic</b> <b>sequences</b> in multiple access communication are shown {{to be similar to}} that of PN sequences. Furthermore, due to their noise like appearance, <b>chaotic</b> <b>sequences</b> outperform PN sequences in low probability of intercept. In this method the spreading sequences change from one bit to the next in very random like fashion, causing undesired interception to be very difficult...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Direct sequence-code {{division}} {{multiple access}} (DS-CDMA) technique is used in cellular systems where users in the cell are separated from each other with their unique spreading codes. In recent times DS-CDMA has been used extensively. These systems suffers from multiple access interference (MAI) due to other users transmitting in the cell, channel inter symbol interference (ISI) due to multipath nature of channels in presence of additive white Gaussian noise(AWGN). Spreading codes {{play an important role}} in multiple access capacity of DS-CDMA system. M-sequences, gold sequences etc., has been traditionally used as spreading codes in DS-CDMA. These sequences are generated by shift registers and periodic in nature. So these sequences are less in number and also limits the security. This paper presents an investigation on use of new type of <b>sequences</b> called <b>chaotic</b> <b>sequences</b> for DS-CDMA system. These sequences are generated by chaotic maps. First of all, <b>chaotic</b> <b>sequences</b> are easy to generate and store. Only a few parameters and functions are needed even for very long sequences. In addition, an enormous number of different sequences can be generated simply by changing its initial condition [...] <b>Chaotic</b> <b>sequences</b> are deterministic, reproducible, uncorrelated and random-like, which can be very helpful in enhancing the security of transmission in communication.
