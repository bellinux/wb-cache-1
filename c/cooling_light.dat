In astrophysical plasmas the dust component accounts for only about 1 % of the mass, nevertheless this component has a profound influence on the thermodynamics, the chemistry and the dynamics. Important physical processes are charging, sputtering, <b>cooling,</b> <b>light</b> absorption and radiation pressure, connecting electromagnetic forces to gravity. Surface chemistry is another important aspect. In the laboratory there is great interest in industrial processes (e. g. etching, vapor deposition) and at the fundamental physics level - the main topic here - the study of strong coupling phenomena. Here the dust (or microparticles) are the dominant component of the multi-species plasma. The particles can be observed in real time and pace, individually resolved at all relevant length and time scales. This provides an unprecedented means for studying self-organisation processes in many particle systems including the onset of cooperative phenomena. Due to the comparatively large mass of the microparticles (10 - 12 to 10 - 9 g) precision experiments are performed on the ISS.
