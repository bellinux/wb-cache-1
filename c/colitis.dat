5|$|Pseudomembranous <b>colitis</b> is a {{potentially}} lethal condition {{commonly associated with}} clindamycin, but which occurs with other antibiotics, as well. Overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, which is inherently resistant to clindamycin, results {{in the production of}} a toxin that causes a range of adverse effects, from diarrhea to <b>colitis</b> and toxic megacolon.|$|E
5|$|Most E. coli strains do {{not cause}} disease, but virulent strains can cause gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, {{neonatal}} meningitis, hemorrhagic <b>colitis,</b> and Crohn's disease. Common {{signs and symptoms}} include severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, hemorrhagic <b>colitis,</b> vomiting, and sometimes fever. In rarer cases, virulent strains are also responsible for bowel necrosis (tissue death) and perforation without progressing to hemolytic-uremic syndrome, peritonitis, mastitis, septicemia, and Gram-negative pneumonia. Very young children {{are more susceptible to}} develop severe illness, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, however, healthy individuals of all ages are at risk to the severe consequences that may arise as a result of being infected with E. coli.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, diarrhea, rash, and pain {{at the site}} of injection. It {{increases}} the risk of hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile <b>colitis</b> about fourfold. Other antibiotics may be recommended instead due to this reason. It appears to be generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein.|$|E
5|$|In vivo {{studies in}} {{mice and rats}} showed that a topically {{administered}} SEGRAM inhibited peroxidase activity and formation of oedema, both indicators of anti-inflammatory activity, comparably to prednisolone. Systemic administration in mice or rats indicate that SEGRAMs can diminish acute infections, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and <b>colitis.</b> In vivo evidence on whether particular SEGRAMs can elicit similar effects than classic glucocorticoid in cancer pathologies is currently lacking.|$|E
5|$|Like {{nearly all}} antibiotics, {{linezolid}} {{has been associated}} with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous <b>colitis,</b> although the latter is uncommon, occurring in about one in two thousand patients in clinical trials. C. difficile appears to be susceptible to linezolid in vitro, and linezolid was even considered as a possible treatment for CDAD.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative <b>colitis</b> (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Fleury has {{organized}} or participated in numerous charitable causes. He launched a hockey {{school in the}} mid-1990s that ran for seven years in Calgary and another eight in Russell, and donated the proceeds to minor hockey associations. Following his diagnosis with Crohn's disease in 1995, Fleury joined with the Crohn's and <b>Colitis</b> Foundation of Canada to host an annual golf tournament in Calgary. The event has raised over $1million, {{and is one of}} the organization's largest fundraising events in the Calgary area. He participates in Flames Alumni events and volunteers with the Calgary Dream Centre, which helps people overcome addiction.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} are sometimes associated with aphthous-like stomatitis, e.g. most commonly Celiac disease, but also {{inflammatory bowel disease}} such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative <b>colitis.</b> The link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption. Less than 5% of people with RAS have Celiac disease, which usually presents with severe malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be {{the only sign of}} celiac disease. Despite this association, a gluten-free diet does not usually improve the oral ulceration.|$|E
5|$|His father William H. McCudden took a {{post at the}} Air Ministry at {{the rank}} of warrant officer after the Great War, but would die tragically at Clapham Junction railway station on 7 July 1920. When he stood up to offer a woman his seat the {{compartment}} door flew open, knocking him {{into the path of}} an oncoming train. Maurice Vincent became a pilot and served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) until he retired through illness in 1933. He died of <b>colitis</b> the following year, leaving a widow and small daughter.|$|E
5|$|Nephrotic syndrome, {{in which}} protein from the {{bloodstream}} is {{released into the}} urine due to kidney diseases, can predispose to thrombosis; this is particularly the case in more severe cases (as indicated by blood levels of albumin below 25g/l) and if the syndrome {{is caused by the}} condition membranous nephropathy. Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative <b>colitis</b> and Crohn's disease) predispose to thrombosis, particularly when the disease is active. Various mechanisms have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Outside of hockey, Fleury overcame his addictions, {{operated}} a concrete business in Calgary with his family, and filmed a pilot for a reality television show about it. He marketed his {{own brand of}} clothing, which led him to play two professional baseball games for the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League. In 1995, {{he was diagnosed with}} Crohn's disease, and his annual charity golf tournament has helped raise more than $1million for the Crohn's and <b>Colitis</b> Foundation of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{had planned}} to {{introduce}} a motion giving notice that he would bring forward a bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade during the 1789 parliamentary session. However, in January 1788, he was taken ill with a probable stress-related condition, now thought to be ulcerative <b>colitis.</b> It was several months before {{he was able to}} resume work, and he spent time convalescing at Bath and Cambridge. His regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities of opium, which proved effective in alleviating his condition, and which he continued to use {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up {{appearances}} {{with their}} friends, seeming happy. In September, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills. The couple never {{spoke of the}} incident, and refused to discuss {{whether or not it}} was a suicide attempt. Scott returned to writing, finishing The Great Gatsby in October. They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby. It was also on this trip, while ill with <b>colitis,</b> that Zelda began painting.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous <b>colitis,</b> usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Zayat Stables' horses Bodemeister {{and then}} Paynter ran second {{in each of}} the three legs of the Triple Crown. Bodemeister {{finished}} a narrow second place in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes to I'll Have Another. Switching horses in the 2012 Belmont Stakes, Zayat's colt Paynter also finished second. Paynter went on to win the Grade I Haskell Invitational but shortly thereafter developed near-fatal complications from <b>colitis</b> and laminitis. Zayat authorized the highest quality of care for the horse, and following abdominal surgery and several months of rehabilitation, Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013. After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the hashtag #PowerUpPaynter, the horse developed a significant fan base, and received hundreds of get well cards, many from children. For his struggle to return to health, Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E
25|$|Both {{infectious}} and non-infectious {{causes for}} <b>colitis</b> exist. In the adult horse, Salmonella, Clostridium difficile, and Neorickettsia risticii (the causative agent of Potomac Horse Fever) are common causes of <b>colitis.</b> Antibiotics, which {{may lead to}} an altered and unhealthy microbiota, sand, grain overload, and toxins such as arsenic and cantharidin {{can also lead to}} <b>colitis.</b> Unfortunately, only 20–30% of acute <b>colitis</b> cases are able to be definitively diagnosed. NSAIDs can cause slower-onset of <b>colitis,</b> usually in the right dorsal colon (see Right dorsal <b>colitis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Initial {{antibiotic}} therapy for less-severe Clostridium difficile <b>colitis</b> (pseudomembranous <b>colitis)</b> consists of oral metronidazole or oral vancomycin. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated equivalent efficacy of oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin in treating this <b>colitis.</b> However, oral vancomycin {{is shown to}} be more effective in treating patients with severe C. difficile <b>colitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|About 20% of {{patients}} with acute ischemic <b>colitis</b> may develop a long-term complication known as chronic ischemic <b>colitis.</b> Symptoms can include recurrent infections, bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and chronic abdominal pain. Chronic ischemic <b>colitis</b> is often treated with surgical removal of the chronically diseased portion of the bowel.|$|E
25|$|Management of {{ulcerative}} <b>colitis</b> involves first {{treating the}} acute {{symptoms of the}} disease, then maintaining remission. Ulcerative <b>colitis</b> {{is a form of}} <b>colitis,</b> a disease of the intestine, specifically the large intestine or colon, that includes characteristic ulcers, or open sores, in the colon. The main symptom of active disease is usually diarrhea mixed with blood, of gradual onset which often leads to anaemia. Ulcerative <b>colitis</b> is, however, a systemic disease that affects many parts of the body outside the intestine.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{megacolon}} {{is mainly}} seen in ulcerative <b>colitis</b> and pseudomembranous <b>colitis,</b> two chronic inflammations {{of the colon}} (and occasionally, in the other type of inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease). Its mechanism is incompletely understood. It is probably due to an excessive production of nitric oxide, at least in ulcerative <b>colitis.</b> The prevalence {{is about the same}} for both sexes.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory bowel {{disease is}} an {{inflammatory}} condition affecting the bowel walls, and includes the subtypes Crohn's disease and ulcerative <b>colitis.</b> While Crohn's {{can affect the}} entire gastrointestinal tract, ulcerative <b>colitis</b> {{is limited to the}} large intestine. Crohn's disease is widely regarded as an autoimmune disease. Although ulcerative <b>colitis</b> is often treated as though it were an autoimmune disease, there is no consensus that it actually is such.|$|E
25|$|Pseudomembranous <b>colitis</b> {{first was}} {{described}} as a complication of C. difficile infection in 1978, when a toxin was isolated from patients suffering from pseudomembranous <b>colitis</b> and Koch's postulates were met.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{incidence}} of ischemic <b>colitis</b> {{is difficult to}} estimate, as many patients with mild ischemia may not seek medical attention. Ischemic <b>colitis</b> is responsible for about 1 in 2000 hospital admissions, and is seen on about 1 in 100 endoscopies. Men and women are affected equally; ischemic <b>colitis</b> is a disease of the elderly, with more than 90% of cases occurring in people {{over the age of}} 60.|$|E
25|$|Ulcerative <b>colitis</b> has a {{significant}} association with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a progressive inflammatory disorder of small and large bile ducts. As many as 5% of patients with ulcerative <b>colitis</b> may progress to develop primary sclerosing cholangitis.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{diarrhea}} can be {{the part}} of the presentations of a number of chronic medical conditions affecting the intestine. Common causes include ulcerative <b>colitis,</b> Crohn's disease, microscopic <b>colitis,</b> celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome and bile acid malabsorption.|$|E
25|$|Curcumin (turmeric) therapy, in {{conjunction}} with taking the medications mesalamine or sulfasalazine, may be effective and safe for maintaining remission in people with quiescent ulcerative <b>colitis.</b> The effect of curcumin therapy alone on quiescent ulcerative <b>colitis</b> is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Ulcerative <b>colitis</b> {{is usually}} {{continuous}} from the rectum, with the rectum almost universally being involved. Perianal disease is rare. The degree of involvement endoscopically ranges from proctitis or {{inflammation of the}} rectum, to left sided <b>colitis,</b> to pancolitis, which is inflammation involving the ascending colon.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease and Coeliac disease found that anti-tTG was increased in inflammatory bowel disease although most cases were not clinical CD. IBD was increased 10 fold in coeliac disease. Inflammatory bowel disease consists of Crohn's disease, ulcerative <b>colitis</b> and microscopic <b>colitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aggregation of {{ulcerative}} <b>colitis</b> in families.|$|E
25|$|Ischemic <b>colitis</b> (also spelled ischaemic <b>colitis)</b> is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which inflammation and injury of the large intestine result from inadequate blood supply. Although uncommon in the general population, ischemic <b>colitis</b> occurs with greater frequency in the elderly, and {{is the most common}} form of bowel ischemia. Causes of the reduced blood flow can include changes in the systemic circulation (e.g. low blood pressure) or local factors such as constriction of blood vessels or a blood clot. In most cases, no specific cause can be identified.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{antibodies}} (ASCAs) are antibodies against antigens {{presented by}} the cell wall of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ASCAs and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCAs) {{are the two most}} useful and often discriminating biomarkers for <b>colitis.</b> ASCA tends to recognize Crohn's disease more frequently, whereas pANCA tend to recognize ulcerative <b>colitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Slow release {{phosphatidylcholine}} {{has some}} evidence of benefit in ulcerative <b>colitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Helminthic {{therapy is}} the use of {{intestinal}} parasitic nematodes to treat ulcerative <b>colitis,</b> and is based on the premises of the hygiene hypothesis. Studies have shown that helminths ameliorate and are more effective than daily corticosteroids at blocking chemically induced <b>colitis</b> in mice, and a trial of intentional helminth infection of rhesus monkeys with idiopathic chronic diarrhea (a condition similar to ulcerative <b>colitis</b> in humans) resulted in remission of symptoms in 4 out of 5 of the animals treated. A randomised controlled trial of Trichuris suis ova in humans found the therapy to be safe and effective, and further human trials are ongoing.|$|E
25|$|Ischemic <b>colitis</b> must be {{differentiated}} {{from the}} many other causes of abdominal pain and rectal bleeding (for example, infection, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulosis, or colon cancer). It {{is also important to}} differentiate ischemic <b>colitis,</b> which often resolves on its own, from the more immediately life-threatening condition of acute mesenteric ischemia of the small bowel.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Crohn's disease, {{ulcerative}} <b>colitis</b> has {{a lesser}} prevalence in smokers than non-smokers.|$|E
25|$|Diet: as {{the colon}} {{is exposed to}} many dietary {{substances}} which may encourage inflammation, dietary factors have been hypothesized {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of both ulcerative <b>colitis</b> and Crohn's disease. Few studies have investigated such an association; one study showed no association of refined sugar on the prevalence of ulcerative <b>colitis.</b> High intake of unsaturated fat and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing ulcerative <b>colitis.</b> Other identified dietary factors that may influence the development and/or relapse of the disease include meat protein and alcoholic beverages. Specifically, sulfur has been investigated as being involved in the etiology of ulcerative <b>colitis,</b> but this is controversial. Sulfur restricted diets have been investigated in patients with UC and animal models of the disease. The theory of sulfur as an etiological factor is related to the gut microbiota and mucosal sulfide detoxification in addition to the diet.|$|E
