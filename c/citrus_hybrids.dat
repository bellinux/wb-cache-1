5000|$|The most known <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> {{that are}} {{sometimes}} {{treated as a}} species by themselves, especially in folk taxonomy, are: ...|$|E
5000|$|Sweet lime etc. (Citrus limetta, etc.); {{assorted}} <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids)</b> including varieties called sweet lemon, sweet limetta or Mediterranean sweet lemon, lumia, Indian or Palestinian sweet lime.|$|E
5000|$|Sweet lemon or {{sweet lime}} refers to many <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> that contain low acid pulp and juice, and are {{identical}} to the common lemon or lime or just similar to them.|$|E
50|$|The citrange is a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> of {{the sweet}} orange and the trifoliate orange.|$|R
50|$|This {{particular}} cultivar is a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid,</b> likely <b>Citrus</b> micrantha × Citrus medica (a papeda-citron cross).|$|R
5000|$|The cam sành (...) or King orange (Citrus reticulata × sinensis) is a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> {{originating}} in Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|The same {{common names}} {{may be given}} to {{different}} <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> or mutations. Fruit with similar ancestry may be quite different in name and traits (e.g. grapefruit, common oranges, and ponkans, all pommelo-mandarin hybrids).|$|E
50|$|Interbreeding seems {{possible}} between all citrus plants, and between citrus plants and some plants {{which may or}} may not be categorized as citrus. The ability of <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> to self-pollinate and to reproduce sexually also helps create new varieties.|$|E
50|$|Most {{cultivated}} Citrus seem to {{be natural}} or artificial hybrids of four core ancestral species — the citron, pummelo, mandarine, and papeda (see image). Natural and cultivated <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> include commercially important fruit such as oranges, grapefruit, lemons, limes, and some tangerines.|$|E
50|$|This <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> {{has many}} other names, such as Al-zanbu, Khoubs al-Arsa, Koubs al-Arsa, Kubbâd, Robs al-Arsa, Zamboa, Zanbo'a, and Zemboua.|$|R
50|$|Reikou (reikō) is a {{cultivar}} of tangor. It is a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> of {{a hybrid}} of Kiyomi and Encore (Kiyomi-Encore No. 5) and Murcott tangor.|$|R
5000|$|Hassaku orange (八朔, {{also called}} [...] "jagada", [...] ) is Japanese <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> similar to an orange in color {{but with the}} size of a grapefruit.|$|R
50|$|Various {{regionally}} based industry associations {{were formed}} to represent growers {{in a national}} process. Government agencies have become increasingly involved with new native crop development. CSIRO researcher, Dr Stephen Sykes, developed a range of native <b>Citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> which became available through ANPI.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> {{include many}} {{varieties}} and species {{that have been}} selected by plant breeders, usually for the useful characteristics of the fruit. Some <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> occurred naturally, {{and others have been}} deliberately created, either by cross pollination and selection among the progeny, or (rarely, and only recently) as somatic hybrids. The aim of plant breeding of hybrids is to use two or more different citrus varieties or species, in order to get intermediate traits, or the most desirable traits of the parents. In some cases, particularly with the natural hybrids, hybrid speciation has occurred, so the new plants are considered a different species from any of their parents. Citrus hybrid names are usually marked with a multiplication sign after the word [...] "Citrus", for example Citrus × aurantifolia.|$|E
50|$|Papeda is {{the most}} {{primitive}} group of citruses. Because of generally slow growth and bitter, less palatable fruits than in other citruses, its species had only limited commercial cultivation. Some species, like Ichang papeda, are used in landscaping, while others are important for rootstocking and as genome source for breeding disease-resistant and frost-hardy <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids.</b>|$|E
50|$|Kalpi (Citrus x webberii) is {{a natural}} <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> native to Philippines and is today {{one of the most}} common lemons in Hawaii, and is {{sometimes}} called Malayan lemon.|$|R
5000|$|Amanatsu (甘夏) or [...] is a {{yellowish}} orange <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> fruit, a {{group of}} cultivars of Citrus natsudaidai, which were discovered in 1740 in the Yamaguchi prefecture of Japan.|$|R
50|$|Rough lemon (Citrus jambhiri Lush.) is {{the fruit}} and the tree of a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> related to the citron and the lemon, with {{character}} traits similar to rangpur or mandarin orange.|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{is starting to}} make sense of this complex phylogeny. Two citrus fruits have had their full genomes sequenced (sweet orange and clementines). Partial sequences of other cultivars may give contradictory results, as some <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> are not at all well-mixed. Many different phylogenies for the non-hybrid citrus have been proposed, and taxonomic terminology is not yet settled.|$|E
50|$|The CSIRO {{has also}} {{developed}} several <b>Citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> by crossing the finger lime with standard Citrus species. These hybrids have created many cultivars which generate finger limes {{in many different}} colors ranging from light pink to deep blue-green. Finger lime {{is thought to have}} the widest range of color variation within any Citrus species. The color of the pulp (juice vesicles) comes in shades of green or pink including pale lime-green, pale pink, coral, and scarlet.|$|E
5000|$|Cold-hardy citrus is citrus with {{increased}} frost tolerance {{which may be}} cultivated far beyond traditional citrus growing regions. Citrus species and <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> typically described as cold-hardy generally display an ability to withstand wintertime temperatures below [...] Cold-hardy citrus may be generally accepted 'true' species (e.g. Satsuma mandarin, Kumquat) or hybrids (e.g. Citrange) involving various other citrus species. All citrus fruits are technically edible, though some have bitter flavors often regarded as unpleasant, and this variability is also seen in cold-hardy citrus fruits. Those listed as [...] "inedible fresh" [...] or [...] "semi-edible" [...] can (like all citrus) be cooked to make marmalade.|$|E
50|$|Citrus ×deliciosa (thorny (Australia), amarillo, beladi, Willowleaf Mandarin, Mediterranean Mandarin) is a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> (mandarin × pumelo), {{though it}} was {{once thought to be}} a pure mandarin. It is related to the ponkan.|$|R
50|$|An oroblanco, oro blanco (white gold) or sweetie (Citrus grandis Osbeck × C. Paradisi Macf.) is a sweet {{seedless}} <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> fruit {{similar to}} grapefruit. It {{is often referred}} to as oroblanco grapefruit.|$|R
50|$|Procimequat is a {{triploid}} <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> or transgeneric hybrid, {{in which}} the Limequat that itself is a cross between lime and a round kumquat, was backcrossed with a kumquat-like fruit, named Fortunella hindsii.|$|R
50|$|Carl Peter Thunberg {{originally}} classified the kumquats as Citrus japonica in his 1784 book, Flora Japonica. In 1915, Walter T. Swingle reclassified {{them in a}} segregate genus, Fortunella, {{named in}} honor of Robert Fortune. Seven species of Fortunella have generally been recognized—F. japonica, F. margarita, F. crassifolia, F. hindsii, F. obovata and F. polyandra, as well as the recently described F. bawangica. Since the kumquat is a cold hardy species, there are many hybrids between common citrus members and the kumquat (most popularly the calamondin that occurred naturally). Those hybrids are not <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids,</b> according to Swingle, but reside in a separate hybrid genus which he called × Citrofortunella.|$|E
40|$|Several {{observations}} were conductet on different <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> derived from crosses of clementine mandarin x trifoliate orange and of clementine mandarin x sour orange. The principal characteristics of leaves, flowers, and fruits were evaluated in such hybrids {{in order to}} determine the inheritance in F 1 progeny. Thc behaviour of nucellar embriony and thc chromosome number also tcsted in all the hybrids studied...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} which introduced <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> (Orlando tangelo, Minneola tangelo, Saminola tangelo, Honey mandarin, Pixie mandarin and Frost dancy tangerine) were crossed with Mosambi, Kinnow and Duncan grapefruit as male parents. Pollen viability and pollen germination studies were also conducted. Pollen viability was maximum in Pixie mandarin (92. 81 %) while least in Frost dancy tangerine (FDT) (16. 27 %). Pollen tube growth studies revealed non-significant difference as pollen tube travelled 9. 16, 5. 80 and 4. 70 % of the gynoecia, in tangelos, mandarins and tangerine hybrids respectively. Kinnow generated the best value as the male parent with Honey mandarin and Orlando tangelo, while the performance with other hybrids was inconsistent as for as specific combining ability (SCA) was concerned. Although, Kinnow belongs to mandarins yet, great variability was found with Pixie mandarin for combining ability. Kinnow proved as a better pollinizer for all the experimental hybrids as for as general combining ability (GCA) is concerned. Mosambi as a male parent behaved inconsistently with experimental hybrids for fruit setting...|$|E
50|$|The ponderosa lemon (Citrus limon × medica) is a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> of a {{lemon and}} a citron. It {{is not the}} same as the Yuma Ponderosa lemon pomello hybrid, that is used as citrus rootstock.|$|R
50|$|The Key lime (Citrus × aurantiifolia) is a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> (C. micrantha x C. medica) with a globose (spherical shaped) fruit, 2.5-5 cm in {{diameter}} (1-2 in), that is yellow when ripe but usually picked green commercially.|$|R
5000|$|Citrumelo or Citromelo (X Citroncirus spp.) is {{also called}} Swingle citrumelo trifoliate hybrid, {{because it is}} a cold hardy <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> between a 'Duncan' {{grapefruit}} and a trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.), developed by Walter Tennyson Swingle.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Alternaria {{brown spot}} (ABS) disease {{is caused by}} the fungus of Alternaria alternata f. sp. citri, which causes injury in leaves, {{branches}} and fruits of citrus. The action of the pathogen {{is directly related to the}} presence of toxin receptors in susceptible genotypes. The objective of this study was to characterize a population of <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> obtained from controlled crosses between Pêra de Abril sweet orange and the hybrid of Murcott tangor x Pêra sweet orange (TM x LP 163) for response to ABS through the in vitro inoculation of fungal spores in young detached leaves. The fungus was isolated from the lesions of Murcott tangor fruits that exhibited ABS symptoms. Two hundred thirty-five hybrids were evaluated, and 70 (30 %) showed different levels of disease symptoms on detached leaves after 72 hours of inoculation with the fungus, and 165 (70 %) were asymptomatic. The frequency of segregation observed (165 R: 70 S) and high level of heritability (h 2 g = 0. 91) suggest that few genes may be involved in controlling the inheritance of ABS resistance in citrus...|$|E
40|$|Diaprepes abbreviatus L. was {{measured}} after rearing them on roots of rutaceous seedlings for 35 or 42 days. Larvae were fed on seedlings of two common citrus rootstocks, two new hybrids {{that are under}} development as rootstocks, and one citrus relative. Live weights of larvae reared on Carrizo or Swingle rootstocks for 42 days increased an average of 10. 3 - and 10. 2 -fold, respectively; weight increases on the <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> HRS- 802 and HRS- 896 for 35 days averaged 7. 6 - and 6. 1 -fold, re-spectively; and weight increase on Glycosmis pentaphylla Retzius for 42 days aver-aged 2. 5 -fold. A bioassay to test for potential phytochemical sources of resistance against the larvae was developed by incorporating finely milled roots into larval diet. Milled root samples were incorporated into a standard semi-defined diet at 5 % con-centrations (w/v), and growth of larval weevils was recorded following a 32 -day feed-ing period. Roots collected from uninfested control seedlings in the previous experiment were used. On diet containing no roots, mean larval weight increased 16. 8 -fold, while weights increased 13. 9 -fold on diet containing roots of Carrizo, 12. 0...|$|E
40|$|Viruses {{have evolved}} as {{combinations}} of genes whose products interact with cellular components to produce progeny virus throughout the plants. Some viral genes, {{particularly those that}} are involved in replication and assembly, tend to be relatively conserved, whereas other genes that have evolved for interactions with the specific host for movement and to counter host–defense systems tend to be less conserved. Closteroviridae encode 1 – 5 nonconserved ORFs. Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), a Closterovirus, possesses nonconserved p 33, p 18, and p 13 genes that are expendable for systemic infection of the two laboratory hosts, Citrus macrophylla and Mexican lime. In this study, we show that the extended host range of CTV requires these nonconserved genes. The p 33 gene was required to systemically infect sour orange and lemon trees, whereas either the p 33 or the p 18 gene was sufficient for systemic infection of grapefruit trees and the p 33 or the p 13 gene was sufficient for systemic infection of calamondin plants. Thus, these three genes are required for systemic infection of the full host range of CTV, but different genes were specific for different hosts. Remarkably, either of two genes was sufficient for infection of some <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids.</b> These findings suggest that CTV acquired multiple nonconserved genes (p 33, p 18, and p 13) and, as a result, gained the ability to interact with multiple hosts, thus extending its host range during the course of evolution. These results greatly extend the complexity of known virus–plant interactions...|$|E
