50|$|This operation, {{performed}} at {{the median age of}} sixteen, is only the first of many surgeries. When a new pretty reaches a certain age (25 or so), they are given the surgery that transforms them into middle-pretties. This surgery is entirely cosmetic (unless the pretty is entering a job which requires creativity and quick-thinking, in which case, some lesions are removed), and can be performed in an afternoon. The second Surge gives the pretty light <b>crows</b> <b>feet</b> and a few grey hairs, which inspire trust and authority. There is no official third surgery, though a crumbly can undergo multiple life-extension surgeries which allow them to live into their mid two-hundreds comfortably and attractively.|$|E

50|$|As the Beinekes arrive, Wednesday and Lucas {{instruct}} {{their families}} to act normal so they can all enjoy a simple dinner ("One Normal Night"). But the moment Lurch ushers the Beinekes into the mansion, tensions begin to mount. Mal wants {{to tear down the}} old house, Alice begins to spout happy poems at random, Pugsley, Fester, and Grandma fail at acting normal, and Wednesday, after wearing black for eighteen years, appears in a bright yellow dress. Later, Lucas and Wednesday, away from their families, reveal that the reason they brought {{their families to}}gether is to announce that they are getting married. Gomez and Mal share a drink where Mal is introduced to Bernice, the family's giant pet squid, and Alice admits to Morticia that her marriage to Mal has grown passionless. Morticia then hears Wednesday call her old and worries that she's getting <b>crows</b> <b>feet.</b> She turns down Gomez's request to tango, leaving him alone and unsatisfied ("Morticia"). Meanwhile, Pugsley is worried that Wednesday's love life means she won't torture him anymore. He steals a potion from Grandma after she reveals it will bring out someone's dark nature. Pugsley plans to slip it to Wednesday at dinner ("What If?").|$|E
5000|$|After {{a three-year}} hiatus, in 1999 he paired with Julia Roberts in Notting Hill, which {{was brought to}} theatres by {{much of the same}} team that was {{responsible}} for Four Weddings and a Funeral. This new Working Title production displaced Four Weddings and a Funeral as the biggest British hit in the history of cinema, with earnings equalling $363 million worldwide. As it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture, the film was also received well by critics. CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said, [...] "Notting Hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds." [...] Reactions to Grants Golden Globe-nominated performance were varied, with Salon.coms Stephanie Zacharek criticising that, [...] "Grants performance stands as an emblem of whats wrong with Notting Hill. Whats maddening about Grant is that he just never cuts the crap. Hes become one of those actors whos all shambling self-caricature, from his twinkly <b>crows</b> <b>feet</b> to the time-lapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out." [...] The film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety, most noted of which was Grants turn as a faux-journalist who sits through a dull press junket with, what the New York Times called, [...] "a delightfully funny deadpan." [...] Grant also released his second production output, a fish-out-of-water mob comedy Mickey Blue Eyes, that year. It was dismissed by critics, performed modestly at the box office, and garnered its actor-producer mixed reviews for his starring role. Roger Ebert thought, [...] "Hugh Grant is wrong for the role and strikes one wrong note and then another," [...] whereas Kenneth Turan, writing in the Los Angeles Times, said, [...] "If hed been on the Titanic, fewer lives would have been lost. If hed accompanied Robert Scott to the South Pole, the explorer would have lived to be 100. Thats how good Hugh Grant is at rescuing doomed ventures." ...|$|E

40|$|Two human {{clinical}} studies were performed. One was an open-label non-controlled study involving 30 healthy female subjects for 8 weeks. Significant improvements were observed by combining 6 mg per day oral supplementation and 2 ml (78. 9 μM solution) per day topical application of astaxanthin. Astaxanthin {{derived from the}} microalgae, Haematococcus pluvialis showed improvements in skin wrinkle (<b>crow’s</b> <b>feet</b> at week- 8), age spot size (cheek at week- 8), elasticity (<b>crow’s</b> <b>feet</b> at week- 8), skin texture (cheek at week- 4), moisture content of corneocyte layer (cheek in 10 dry skin subjects at week- 8) and corneocyte condition (cheek at week- 8). It may suggest that astaxanthin derived from H. pluvialis can improve skin condition in all layers such as corneocyte layer, epidermis, basal layer and dermis by combining oral supplementation and topical treatment. Another was a randomized double-blind placebo controlled study involving 36 healthy male subjects for 6 weeks. <b>Crow’s</b> <b>feet</b> wrinkle and elasticity; and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were improved after 6 mg of astaxanthin (the same as former study) daily supplementation. Moisture content and sebum oil level at the cheek zone showed strong tendencies for improvement.
