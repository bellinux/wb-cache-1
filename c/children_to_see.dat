It contains garden birds, a wren's nest and a tawny owl. This display plays birdsong recordings, which young children can learn quickly. This serves as an introduction to pishing.|$|E
25|$|The {{release date}} was {{originally}} set for November 4, 2011, but was pushed {{a week earlier}} to October 28, 2011. Anne Globe, head of worldwide marketing for DreamWorks Animation, said the decision to move the film's release date a week earlier was to attract parents and their <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the film before other family-friendly movies were released in November 2011.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Reeve was in three roles for {{television}} {{in which he}} was cast as a villain. The most notable of these was Bump in the Night based on the novel by Isabelle Holland in which Reeve played a child molester who abducts a young boy in New York City. The movie got fair to positive reviews. Reeve felt it was important for parents of young <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the film. It is on home video in the UK, but not in the US.|$|E
5000|$|Realistic estrangement is a {{different}} phenomenon from [...] "pathological alienation". The former is an understandable refusal by a <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an abusive parent, while the latter is emotionally harmful and unjustified.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{benefit is}} an {{educational}} one. It {{is far better}} for a <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{the course of a}} stream or the formation of a volcano than to read about it in a book.|$|R
60|$|Sally's bright face {{expressed}} {{only the}} vague curiosity of a <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> something new; {{but the little}} Mara resisted and hung back with all her force, so that Mrs. Kittridge was obliged to take her up and hold her.|$|R
25|$|On 6 October 1789, {{the royal}} family was forced by a Parisian mob mostly {{composed}} of women to move from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, where they spent {{the next three years}} as prisoners under the daily surveillance of the national guards who did not spare any humiliation to {{the royal family}}; at that time Marie Antoinette was always surrounded by guards, even in her bedroom at night and these guards were present when the Queen was allowed to see her children. The family lived a secluded life, and Marie Antoinette dedicated most of her time to her two children under the daily surveillance of the national guards who kept her hands behind her back and searched everybody from the Queen to the <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if any letters were smuggled to the royal prisoner. On 21 June 1791, the family tried to escape in {{what is known as the}} Flight to Varennes, but the attempt failed. After the family was recognized, they were brought back to Paris. When the Tuileries Palace was stormed by an armed mob on 10 August 1792, the royal family sought refuge at the Legislative Assembly.|$|E
25|$|When Moriarty took over, {{he decided}} to start again from scratch. This version of the {{production}} was even more similar to the released game. However, it contained one extra character: a Japanese business tycoon and science-hobbyist named Toshi Olema, who uses his money to buy his way onto the Attila project crew. Toshi would have met a gruesome death when he stumbled into a cavern with acid dripping from the ceiling, and the other astronauts would {{have been unable to}} safely retrieve his body and bring him back with life crystals. He was later completely removed from the story. This version of the game was also very bloody and adult. Initially, Spielberg thought this feel was very fitting. However, after the release of Jurassic Park in 1993, Spielberg received numerous complaints from parents who had ignored the PG-13 rating and brought their young <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the movie, only to discover that it contained some sequences of horror, blood, and violence. Thus, worrying that parents would make a similar mistake and purchase The Dig for their kids, Spielberg requested the violence be toned down. Other notable design ideas which were dropped during the game's production include a survival angle, which forced the player to keep water and food supplies for life support, and exploration of entire cities on the planet. Although The Dig was first announced for release in Summer 1992, it ultimately did not launch until December 1995.|$|E
500|$|Naylor penned the sequels in {{response}} to [...] "the surprising degree of hatred which children show toward Judd Travers". Noting that Judd's life had been molded by the abuse he suffered as a child, she hoped that the novels would enable <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Judd as a person like Marty who must make difficult moral choices.|$|E
25|$|Most {{countries}} have statutes and laws that regulate the registration of births. In all countries, {{it is the}} responsibility of the mother's physician, midwife, hospital administrator, or the parents of the <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the birth is properly registered with the appropriate government agency.|$|R
6000|$|Ben {{ran after}} the <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{that he came}} to no harm, and {{presently}} returned to report that Alfred had been met by a servant, and gone away chanting a new verse of his poem, in which peacocks, donkeys, and [...] "the flowers of life" [...] were sweetly mingled.|$|R
60|$|Every {{few minutes}} {{he would put}} {{his head into the}} room where he had left the <b>child,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if it wanted anything, and if it cried even the least bit he would run in and take it in his arms and soothe the little girl until she smiled again.|$|R
500|$|There are {{a number}} of Genesis tribute bands, {{including}} ReGenesis who focus on the group's 1970s repertoire, and Mama, who cover all eras of the band. The most successful act has been the Canadian-French band The Musical Box that have been officially endorsed by the band and had Hackett and Collins perform as guests with them. Gabriel has taken his <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Musical Box, so [...] "they could see what their father did back then", while Hackett has said [...] "They not only manage to sound, but look virtually identical".|$|E
500|$|Jessie Charlotte Bond {{was born}} in Camden Town, London, the third of five {{children}} (and eldest daughter) born to John and Elizabeth Bond. [...] John Bond was a pianomaker who gave his children a musical education. [...] Bond's mother often took the <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> theatre. [...] When Jessie Bond was six, her family moved to Liverpool, where she grew up. [...] At the age of eight, she played a Beethoven piano sonata in a concert. To help with family expenses, Bond taught music as a teenager. At the age of sixteen, she began to study singing, which she much preferred to teaching. The same year, at Hope Hall (now the Everyman Theatre) in Liverpool, she accompanied the music students of professor Isouard Praeger. The next year, she made her own concert singing debut.|$|E
500|$|The school {{moved to}} its final {{location}} in 1917, at Vanderlip Hall, a building Vanderlip constructed in 1916 bordering Albany Post Road (current U.S. Route 9). The building {{was designed for}} classes of ten, to accommodate 120 children total. It was situated on Beechwood's [...] parkland designed by Frederick Law Olmsted for the Vanderlips. Throughout the school's history, students were open to wander the woodlands and gardens, utilize the lawns and tennis courts, and swim in the Olympic-sized pool. There were always farm animals nearby for the <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and play with and a circus carousel to ride on. The school had a gymnasium class, amateur theater group, folk singing, a swimming pool, and an economic forum. Frank Vanderlip had spent about $500,000 on the school ($ in [...] ). Regular art exhibits were held at the Scarborough School, including a sculpture exhibition in the Italian garden at Beechwood, which included works by Jose de Creeft, Jason Seley (a longtime professor of sculpture at Cornell), and Richard Stankiewicz.|$|E

In Austin, Wheeler continued Tooth and Justice for the University of Texas student paper The Daily Texan. Ending that strip, he published other daily cartoons with the paper, with titles like Life and Times and Interlude.|$|R
500|$|In 2003, Father Peter Fleetwood, {{a priest}} incardinated in the Archdiocese of Liverpool {{at the time}} serving as an {{official}} of the Pontifical Council for Culture, made comments supportive of the novels during a press conference announcing the release of Jesus Christ the Bearer of the Water of Lifeâ€”A Christian reflection on the [...] "New Age." [...] In response to a question asking if the magic presented in the Harry Potter series should be considered in the same light as some New Age practices warned against in the document, Fleetwood stated, [...] "If I have understood well the intentions of Harry Potter's author, they help <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the difference between good and evil. And she is very clear on this." [...] He added that Rowling is [...] "Christian by conviction, is Christian in her mode of living, even in her way of writing." [...] This comment was seized on by the media as an endorsement of the novels from the Catholic Church, and by extension, the Pope at that time, John Paul II, though {{there is no evidence that}} the Pope officially approved of the novels.|$|E
2500|$|Ebert {{also stated}} that the R-rated film should have instead been rated NC-17 (an MPAA rating even harsher than the R rating) in a [...] "Movie Answer Man" [...] response, adding that no level-minded parent should ever allow <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Campbell {{launched}} his charity [...] "Kids go live" [...] which allows inner city <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{a variety of}} live sporting events such as Wimbledon, the Olympic Games and rugby internationals. If he wins the legal case against Portsmouth, he plans to give {{much of the money}} to the charity.|$|E
5000|$|Kutaragi {{always had}} the desire to [...] "tinker", often taking apart toys as a <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how they worked. This curiosity carried from childhood, leading him as a {{teenager}} to learn the intricacies of electronics. Eventually, in fact, his love of electronics led to him enrolling in University of Electro-Communications, where he acquired an Electronics degree.|$|R

50|$|He {{was born}} to peasants in Valle de Santiago, Guanajuato, and ran way from home as a <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> other lands and customs of the people. At the age of 18, he joined the EjÃ©rcito Trigarante {{to fight for the}} Independence of Mexico where he was promoted, and had his best {{performance}} in the defense of Tampico against an expedition eight years after the independence was consummated.|$|R
2500|$|Critics {{and even}} some of the actors {{expressed}} shock at the British Board of Film Classification rating of the film â€” 12A â€” which allowed children under twelve in Britain to see the film if accompanied by their parents. Angelina Jolie called it [...] "remarkable it has the rating it has", and said she would not be taking her own <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it. In the United States, the Motion Picture Association of America rated the film as PG-13 ("Parents Strongly Cautioned: Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13").|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to this, {{there were also}} complaints from audiences about the violence depicted in the film. These complaints were particularly present in people who had brought their <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the film, many of whom {{walked out of the}} theater before the film had ended. Dante admitted to reporters later that [...] "the idea of taking a 4-year-old to see Gremlins, thinking it's going to be a cuddly, funny animal movie and then seeing that it turns into a horror picture, I think people were upset... They felt like they had been sold something family friendly and it wasn't entirely family friendly".|$|E
2500|$|After the discovery, Bopp was {{in demand}} on {{television}} and radio, and was invited to speak at conferences. On March 21, 1997 Hale and Bopp were named ABC Person of the Week in the Friday night broadcast. Bopp has said that [...] "I {{thought that it would}} be a comet that would be mentioned in the back of some obscure textbook somewhere, but it's certainly not turned out to be that way." [...] As Hale-Bopp became more visible, Bopp left his job and became a full-time speaker and educator. He enjoyed presenting in schools, science centers and museums, enthusing children with astronomy, and even met up with his co-discoverer Hale in Queensland while taking a group of school <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the 2012 eclipse in Australia.|$|E

This person was a 9-year-old child, living in the United Kingdom, who along with the family came to spend their vacation in Kosovo. The family arrived to the Pristina Airport from London, and during the flight, health inspectors recommended the <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a doctor, once they arrived to Pristina.|$|R
2500|$|Visual {{effects for}} the film were {{undertaken}} by London-based company Framestore. According to Spielberg, the film's only digital effects are three shots lasting three seconds, which were undertaken {{to ensure the safety}} of the horse involved: [...] "That's the thing I'm most proud of. Everything you see on screen really happened." [...] Kathleen Kennedy elaborated, stating [...] "We really did it very naturalistically. There isn't a lot of blood. Steven wasn't interested in bringing Private Ryan into it, but we did want to make a PG-13 movie." [...] Actor Tom Hiddleston said of the film that Spielberg had [...] "seen the stage play and he wanted to retain the magic and heartbeat of that ... It's a moving, powerful story you can take <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> but it is still very upsetting ... People die, and it is war." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the Spice Girls {{reformed}} {{and announced}} plans to embark upon a reunion tour, from which they {{were said to have}} earned Â£10 million each (approximately $20 million). Victoria had previously stated that she and her former Spice colleagues were enjoying their solo careers in various fields, saying [...] "We're all still doing our own thing." [...] Their Greatest Hits album was released in early November 2007 and the tour began on 2 December 2007. At its advent, Beckham said [...] "I wanted my <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Mummy was a pop star. It was the last opportunity for them to stand in a crowd full of people screaming for the Spice Girls." [...] When Beckham had her hair coloured brown for the tour, she stated that her sons immediately reacted by saying [...] "Oh my goodness, it's Posh Spice. She's back." [...] She was {{the only member of the}} group not to sing a solo song on the tour, instead posing in the style of a fashion show on a makeshift catwalk, whereas the others each performed a number from their solo careers.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{years before}} the poem begins, the sons of Har and Heva revolted and {{abandoned}} their parents. Tiriel subsequently set himself up as a tyrant in the west, driving one of his brothers, Ijim, into exile in the wilderness, and chaining the other, Zazel, in a cave in the mountains. Tiriel then made slaves of his own children, until eventually, led by the eldest son, Heuxos, they too rebelled, overthrowing their father. Upon his demise, Tiriel refused their offer of refuge in the palace, and instead went into exile in the mountains with his wife, Myratana. Five years later, the poem begins with the now blind Tiriel returning to the kingdom with his dying wife, as he wants his <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her death, believing them to be responsible and cursing them for betraying him five years previously; [...] "Come you accursed sons./In my weak arms. I here have borne your dying mother/Come forth sons of the Curse come forth. see the death of Myratana" [...] (1:7-9). Soon thereafter, Myratana dies, and Tiriel's children again ask him to remain with them but he refuses and wanders away, again cursing them and telling them he will have his revenge; ...|$|E
