5|$|In 1964, Altgens testified for the Warren Commission and {{was asked}} about the gunfire and whether he knew its source. He said he had not been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he {{believed}} them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot that came from the vicinity of the book depository building, but he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> with any certainty.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Jassy in January 1792 {{ended the}} Russian {{war with the}} Ottomans, and in April of that year the First Coalition wars began, forcing Prussia to move the bulk of its forces west to deal with revolutionary France. Russia, angered by Poland's attempt {{to move out of}} its influence, invaded Poland in May. Around that time, Prussian policy was already set against Poland; rather than {{discussing}} how to aid it, Frederic Wilhelm and his ministers were discussing how to convince Austria and Prussia to a new partition. Lucchesini has already made several declarations that Prussia cannot aid the Commonwealth, and in June that year, Potocki's mission to Berlin received a confirmation of that, motivated {{on the grounds that the}} Constitution of 3 May changed Polish state so much that Prussia does not consider its obligations binding. Prussian Foreign Minister, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg-Kehnert, has clearly and with rare candor told Potocki that Prussia did not support the constitution, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> so initially, as to not allow any Polish-Russian reconciliation, and now will not even help as a mediator, as it is not in Prussian's interest of the state to see Commonwealth strengthened so that it could threaten Prussia in some future.|$|E
25|$|During the search, {{outside the}} mansion, Briony catches {{a glimpse of}} a man assaulting Lola. Lola <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> who {{attacked}} her, as her eyes were covered. In the ensuing investigation, Briony insists she saw Robbie as the assailant with her very own eyes. She looks for the indecent note Robbie had sent Cecilia, and shows it to back up her testimony. Robbie is arrested and imprisoned.|$|E

When Tillakaratne Dilshan asked for the umpire Mark Benson's decision to give him out caught behind to be reviewed, the English official changed his verdict when the television replay umpire Rudi Koertzen <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> conclusively that the ball had hit his bat or the ground on the way through to the Indian wicketkeeper.|$|E
25|$|In late September it was {{announced}} that several Tour de France riders were to have their blood samples retested for traces of EPO. Pierre Bordry, the head of AFLD, claimed the testing involved riders who were already under scrutiny for suspicious urine samples. AFLD had suspicion that there was MIRCERA in some samples but the laboratory <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> definitively. The urine tests were somewhat unreliable at giving definitive results, so the AFLD decided to order the blood samples taken before and during the Tour for additional testing with a newly developed CERA blood test.|$|E

500|$|Early in 1912, Commissioner Lane {{returned}} to New York {{to preside over}} hearings (begun on the Commission's own initiative) into oil pipelines. [...] While investigating the sale of pipelines to the Standard Oil Company, he grew frustrated with the testimony of a witness who, though secretary of several pipeline companies, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> who authorized the sales. [...] "I don't {{want to deal with}} a clerk or one of your $5,000 a year men. I want testimony from someone who can speak with authority." [...] The Commission held that oil pipelines were common carriers, and ordered the companies owning them to file rate schedules and otherwise comply with the Interstate Commerce Act.|$|E
500|$|The {{funds for}} the {{dividend}} payment were raised by a debenture of £50,000. By the end of 1890 many City figures were suspicious of the Hansard Union, and were calling it [...] "Bottomley's swindle". Despite Bottomley's outward optimism, in December 1890 the company defaulted on the payment of debenture interest and in May 1891, amid growing rumours of insolvency, the debenture holders petitioned for the company's compulsory winding-up. In the same month Bottomley, who had taken at least £100,000 from the company, filed a petition for bankruptcy. Under examination by the Official Receiver, he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> where the money had gone, and professed total ignorance of the company's book-keeping. After further enquiries, the Board of Trade instituted prosecutions for fraud against Bottomley, Isaacs and two others.|$|E
500|$|Patton sees Woo's actions, attitudes, and {{portrayal}} of the evil manipulator make her into the alien of the law firm, and as such many of the lawyers in the firm {{did not want her}} hired. [...] Campbell, a Euro-American male at the firm stated, [...] "With her as a lawyer, the whole thing (the dynamic make-up of the firm) will change." [...] Not only is her non-White presence questioned but her competency too. Even though she was the law review editor in law school, the presumption was she got the job mainly because Fish <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> no to Woo and her sexual promises. Woo is seen as an unwelcome addition to the law team despite her expertise and her success in law school.|$|E

500|$|The falsification {{principle}} {{has been}} developed as an alternative theory by which {{it may be possible}} to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning, and those that are meaningless. It proposes that most religious language is unfalsifiable because there is no way that it could be empirically proven false. In a landmark paper published in 1945, analytic philosopher Antony Flew argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs; for example, the statement [...] "God loves us" [...] both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not love us. Flew maintained that if a religious believer <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> what circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false, then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless.|$|E
500|$|The {{nomination}} {{meeting was}} held on 18 January at the Town Hall. The returning officer, John Hall, read the writ. Richard Packer proposed Sewell as a candidate, and William Wilson seconded this. Hart was proposed by Mr Sutcliffe and seconded by Mr Rees. Both Sewell and Hart then spoke. Sewell {{stressed the importance of}} electing the right person, with reference to his experience and Hart being an unknown quantity. Hart argued that it was his right to put himself forward. Whilst Hart <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that he received his qualifications from Oxford or Cambridge, he had obtained his [...] "knowledge from the university of common sense". He further argued that he was as able as Packer, whom he regarded as a locum tenens for Sewell. He criticised Sewell for not residing in Christchurch.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to acting in films, Chopra {{is active in}} charity work and supports a number of causes. She walked the ramp at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week to support the Shabana Azmi Mijwan Welfare Society, an NGO dedicated to empowering girls. Chopra said, [...] "I don't {{want it to be}} just about ramp walk, but I seriously and genuinely feel for what Mijwan and what Manish and Shabanaji are doing. For such an initiative, I just <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> no. I had {{to be a part of}} it." [...] She also appeared on NDTV's Greenathon, an initiative to support eco-friendliness and investigate poor electricity supplies in rural villages, to lend her support. Apart from charity work, she serves as an ambassador for a number of brands. Chopra endorses brands such as Kurkure, Nivea, Maaza and Spinz, WeChat, Pantene and Mahindra scooty. She became the first Bollywood star to endorse products from both Coke (Maaza) and PepsiCo (Kurkure) at the same time.|$|E

500|$|Glenn Close, who was {{directed}} by Josh Weinstein, was convinced to do the episode partially because of James L. Brooks. Mona Simpson was designed in a way {{so that she would}} somewhat resemble Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Mona Simpson's crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because she came back to help Mr. Burns. The character was named after Richard Appel's wife at the time, the novelist Mona Simpson. When Mona gets in the van, her voice is done by Pamela Hayden because Glenn Close <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> [...] "d'oh!" [...] properly and thus they used the original temp track recorded by Hayden.|$|E
500|$|To {{break the}} {{deadlock}} over verification, Macmillan proposed a compromise in February 1959 whereby {{each of the}} original parties {{would be subject to}} a set number of on-site inspections each year. In May 1959, Khrushchev and Eisenhower agreed to explore Macmillan's quota proposal, though Eisenhower made further test-ban negotiations conditional on the Soviet Union dropping its Control Commission veto demand and participating in technical discussions on identification of high-altitude nuclear explosions. Khrushchev agreed to the latter and was noncommittal on the former. A working group in Geneva would eventually devise a costly system of 5–6 satellites orbiting at least [...] above the earth, though it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> with certainty that such a system would be able to determine the origin of a high-altitude test. US negotiators also questioned whether high-altitude tests could evade detection via radiation shielding. Concerning Macmillan's compromise, the Soviet Union privately suggested it would accept a quota of three inspections per year. The US argued that the quota should be set according to scientific necessity (i.e., be set according to the frequency of seismic events).|$|E
500|$|Extant {{biographies of}} Epaminondas universally {{describe}} {{him as one of}} the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states. Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean campaign: [...] "Now I for my part <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that his campaign proved fortunate; yet of all possible deeds of forethought and daring the man seems to me to have left not one undone." [...] Diodorus is effusive in his praise for Epaminondas's military record: [...] "For it seems to me that he surpassed his contemporaries...in skill and experience in the art of war. For among the generation of Epaminondas were famous men: Pelopidas the Theban, [...] Timotheus and Conon, also Chabrias and Iphicrates...Agesilaus the Spartan, who belonged to a slightly older generation. Still earlier than these, in the times of the Medes and Persians, there were Solon, Themistocles, Miltiades, and Cimon, Myronides, and Pericles and certain others in Athens, and in Sicily Gelon, son of Deinomenes, and still others. All the same, if you should compare the qualities of these with the generalship and reputation of Epaminondas, you would find the qualities possessed by Epaminondas far superior".|$|E

500|$|Hemingway {{returned}} home early in 1919 {{to a time}} of readjustment. Not yet 20 years old, he had gained from the war a maturity that was at odds with living at home without a job and {{with the need for}} recuperation. As Reynolds explains, [...] "Hemingway could not really tell his parents what he thought when he saw his bloody knee. He <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> how scared he was in another country with surgeons who could not tell him in English if his leg was coming off or not." [...] In September, he took a fishing and camping trip with high school friends to the back-country of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The trip became the inspiration for his short story [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", in which the semi-autobiographical character Nick Adams takes to the country to find solitude after returning from war. A family friend offered him a job in Toronto, and with nothing else to do, he accepted. Late that year he began as a freelancer, staff writer, and foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star Weekly. He returned to Michigan the following June and then moved to Chicago in September 1920 to live with friends, while still filing stories for the Toronto Star.|$|E

500|$|... "Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood" [...] {{was written}} by Dan McGrath and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. The episode was recorded at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles. Ernest Borgnine guest starred in the episode as himself. The staff liked {{his work on the}} films Marty and From Here to Eternity, so they asked him to do a guest appearance on the show. Borgnine felt he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> no to the offer because his grandchildren were fans of the show. In the final scene of the episode, Borgnine plays a guitar and sings campfire songs with the children. Borgnine was a guitar player in real life, so he brought his own guitar with him to the recording studio. Borgnine apologized because he felt that he was not being able to sing very well, but Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart, thought his voice [...] "added to the authenticity of his character". The Simpsonss creator Matt Groening thought the recording sessions with Borgnine were [...] "so much fun". Hank Azaria, who provides the voice of Apu, commented that Borgnine [...] "had no idea what the hell he was doing. He's a good actor, and he read his lines just fine, but {{he had no idea what}} the show was, no idea what we were doing." ...|$|E
