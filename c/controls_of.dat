40|$|Issues {{important}} in rotorcraft flight control are discussed. A perceptual description is suggested {{of what is}} believed to be the major issues in flight control. When the task is considered <b>of</b> a pilot <b>controlling</b> a helicopter in flight, the task is decomposed in several subtasks. These subtasks include: (1) the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> altitude, (2) the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> speed, (3) the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> heading, (4) the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> orientation, (5) the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> flight over obstacles, and (6) the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> flight to specified positions in the world. The first four subtasks can be considered to be primary control tasks as they are not dependent on any other subtasks. However, the latter two subtasks can be considered hierarchical tasks as they are dependent on other subtasks. For example, the task <b>of</b> flight <b>control</b> over obstacles can be decomposed as a task requiring the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> speed, altitude, and heading. Thus, incorrect <b>control</b> <b>of</b> altitude should result in poor <b>control</b> <b>of</b> flight over an obstacle...|$|R

5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E

5|$|Destruction Derby is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} {{based on the}} sport of demolition derby. The game contains three vehicles. Collisions in the game affect the <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> each car, limiting their steering and maximum speed. Frontal collisions risk damage to the car's radiator, which causes the car to overheat and stop running. Four game modes are available: Destruction Derby, Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing and Time Trial. In Destruction Derby, the player earns points by destroying other cars in a large, trackless arena called The Bowl; in Stock Car Racing, the player must finish in first place, and no points are awarded for destroying cars. Wreckin' Racing is a hybrid of the two, in which the player earns points both by winning the race and by destroying other cars. Time Trial is a solo time attack mode. The PlayStation version features system link play for two players, while the MS-DOS version has an online multiplayer mode.|$|E

5|$|Development of the PlayStation Vita port began {{shortly before}} the start of the game's service in 2014. The team formed a {{partnership}} with Sony to develop the title, but production ran into difficulties as the team attempted to create an experience of the same quality as the mobile version, along with adjusting the controls from touch-based to the button and joystick <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> the Vita. There was also some resistance from staff surrounding the usage of the Mana franchise and Oyamada's determination to bring Rise of Mana to consoles in the face of suggestions that it would be better to make a completely new game. When the project was proposed to Sony, the Unity technology built into the Vita was fairly new and did not make full use of the platform's processing power. In addition, the staff were unused to the version of Unity for the Vita. The team needed cooperation from both Sony and Unity Technologies to optimize the engine so the game could run on the new platform. By the time of the Vita version's announcement, only the preliminary development work had been completed, but development was proceeding according to plan. Technical troubles related to the game's performance persisted beyond this point, resulting in the release being delayed into the following year.|$|E

After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of a PlayStation 2 version of Elite Force was announced in late 2000.

Elite Force {{was to be the}} second PlayStation 2 project undertaken by Majesco. The PlayStation 2 version of the game includes most of the same content as the computer version of the game, albeit that the game's graphics were simplified slightly for the console. Due to the lack of online support for the PlayStation 2, the port only allows for four players to compete in a multiplayer game. Pipe Dream paid particular attention to adjusting the <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> the game to suit the PlayStation 2's gamepad, introducing an auto-aim feature to assist the player. The first screenshots of the game were released in March 2001, and the game was released on December 11, 2001.|$|E
