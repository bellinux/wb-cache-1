50|$|Generally {{the tubes}} {{are made of}} {{stainless}} steel, copper alloys such as brass or bronze, <b>cupro</b> <b>nickel,</b> or titanium depending on several selection criteria. The use of copper bearing alloys such as brass or <b>cupro</b> <b>nickel</b> is rare in new plants, due to environmental concerns of toxic copper alloys. Also depending on the steam cycle water treatment for the boiler, it may be desirable to avoid tube materials containing copper. Titanium condenser tubes are usually the best technical choice, however the use of titanium condenser tubes has been virtually eliminated by the sharp increases in the costs for this material. The tube lengths range to about 85 ft (26 m) for modern power plants, {{depending on the size}} of the condenser. The size chosen is based on transportability from the manufacturers’ site and ease of erection at the installation site. The outer diameter of condenser tubes typically ranges from 3/4 inch to 1-1/4 inch, based on condenser cooling water friction considerations and overall condenser size.|$|E
50|$|A {{new series}} of coins, {{featuring}} a portrait of Augusto César Sandino, was introduced in 1981, consisting of aluminum 5 and 10 centavos, nickel-clad steel 25 centavos and cupro-nickel 50 centavos, 1 and 5 córdobas. Nickel clad steel replaced <b>cupro</b> <b>nickel</b> between 1983 and 1984. In 1987, the final coins of the 1st córdoba were issued, featuring Sandino's characteristic hat. Aluminum 500 córdobas were issued.|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} {{accelerated}} corrosion tests in salt spray chamber {{in order to}} know how aggressively they possess the polluted salt marsh in the seaport area {{and especially in the}} southern base of the Ecuadorian Navy on metal materials, where it is known that there are large environmental corrosion problems not only their marine condition, but also because it was verified that the pH of the water of the estuary is less than 7 and has been modified by industrial pollution which leads to failure of materials resistant to marine environments. The objective of this thesis was a study of the corrosion of engineering materials known to determine the rate of deterioration of them. The metals selected for evaluation in a standard salt spray chamber using the ASTM B 117 specification are: Aluminum bronze, Stainless Steel AISI 304 Stainless Steel AISI 306 Stainless Steel 406, Brass and Brass or bronze called Silver <b>Cupro</b> - <b>Nickel</b> (Cu 30 % Ni) ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1988, a third {{redesign}} of aluminum 5, 10, 20, 50 qindarka and 1 lek coins was released. The 50 qindarka and 1 lek coins were problematically identical in size, weight, and appearance so aluminum-bronze 1 lek coins with the inscription [...] "Republika Popullore Socialiste e Shqipërisë" [...] were released {{later that year}} for better identification. In 1989, a <b>cupro</b> <b>nickel</b> 2 leke coin was introduced. All three of these coin series remained in circulation during and shortly after the 1991 revolution.|$|E
5000|$|An oval {{medallion}} measuring 38mm high by 32mm wide in {{a silver}} coloured [...] <b>cupro</b> <b>nickel</b> metal. On the obverse is the crowned head of Queen Elizabeth II and the legend ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA FID. DEF. The reverse of the medal depicts three shields bearing the initials of the three main services [...] "CD", [...] "AFS" [...] and [...] "NHSR" [...] with an oak branch in the background. A separate Northern Ireland version existed with the lower shields bearing [...] "AFRS" [...] and [...] "HRS".|$|E
50|$|In 1878, the British {{adopted a}} copper 'gas-check' {{at the base}} of their studded {{projectiles}} and in 1879 tried a rotating gas check to replace the studs, leading to the 1881 automatic gas-check. This was soon followed by the Vavaseur copper driving band as part of the projectile. The driving band rotated the projectile, centred it in the bore and prevented gas escaping forwards. A driving band has to be soft but tough enough to prevent stripping by rotational and engraving stresses. Copper is generally most suitable but <b>cupro</b> <b>nickel</b> or gilding metal were also used.|$|E

Umbergaon is home to many industries. The industries in Umbergaon was setup during & after british colonial period. Thereon, many other industries have come in [...]Chandan Steel Limited and Rajendra Industrial Corporation are manufacturer's of forged components. Umbergaon is home to many Spices industries that include two top spices brand of the country i.e. Badshah Masala & Everest Masala and other top industries like Plastic industries i.e Kusum Packaging and RP Plastomers Pvt Ltd.

40|$|Inspection of {{non-ferrous}} {{cast material}} is routinely carried {{out looking for}} casting defects inherent for the manufacturing process. The NDT methods employed are Radiography and Ultrasonics, primarily for sub-surface or internal defects and Penetrants fo r surface breaking defects. Electromagnetic techniques have not been used on cast material except maybe for conductivity determination. This limitation resulting fi 7 om the surface roughness normally associated with cast surfaces and the fact the other techniques mention above have been very successful in finding and evaluating the discontinuities sought. The possible application of Electromagnetic techniques on surfaces in the as-cast condition of non-ferromagnetic material came about because of specific problems experienced by industry. Two major investigations were offered namely; 1) Investigation of CNC material - CuNiCr [1. 6 %Cr] castings exhibiting oxide entrapment {{in the form of}} networks. 2) Investigation of NAB - Nickel Aluminium Bronze exhibiting selective phase corrosion on immersion in seawater. The detection and measurement of both oxide entrapment and phase selective corrosion was difficult and in cases impossible with conventional NDT methods employed for quality control of these material/component types. Time of Flight DiMaction Ultrasonics did give some 50 % detectability of phase selective corrosion, but the method was found to be expensive and very time consuming. The metallurgical properties of the material and morphology of the defects have been studied for both <b>Cupro</b> <b>Nickel</b> Chromium and Nickel Aluminium Bronze cast alloys. An investigation was then conducted to study the effects of eddy current signals and their potential in detecting, both linear and cluster type defects which were predominantly interdendritic with some reported as intergranular in nature. For inspecting <b>Cupro</b> <b>Nickel</b> Chromium castings two successful eddy current methods have been developed. Detection of surface flaws was achieved by high frequency [2 MHzj examination and subsurface flaws by using low frequencies [1 [...] 'IKHz] but using specifically developed sensors that provided good penetration but maintained sensitivity to the fine defects. In the case of Nickel Aluminium Bronze material, the investigation was to look at electromagnetic techniques, which best utilizes the inherent feature of permeability/conductivity associated with this non- ferromagnetic material and any changes that phase selective corrosion may produce. Some meaningful results were obtained using a combination of edd'y current excitation with detection via magneto -re s istive sensors. Testing through 30 - 40 mm of material to detect small magnetic variation produced by only 1 - 2 mm of corrosion penetration was difficult to quantify. Detection and assessment however appeared hopeful when examination was carried out from the corroded surface. With quantifiable samples a meaningful technique using eddy current excitation and magneto-resistive sensor for detection can be developed.
