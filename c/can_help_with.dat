5|$|Corals are shallow, colonial {{organisms that}} {{integrate}} δ18O and trace elements into their skeletal aragonite (polymorph of calcite) crystalline structures, as they grow. Geochemistry anomalies within the crystalline structures of corals represent functions of temperature, salinity and oxygen isotopic composition. Such geochemical analysis <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> climate modeling.|$|E

5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> buoyancy, protection from predators (they {{would have a hard}} time getting through a thick layer of fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E
5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} patient, {{the partner}} of an injured person {{frequently}} needs support and counseling. It <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> adjustment to a new relationship dynamic and self-image (such as being placed {{in the role of}} caretaker) or with stresses that arise in the sexual relationship. Frequently, partners of injured people must contend with feelings like guilt, anger, anxiety, and exhaustion while dealing with the added financial burden of lost wages and medical expenses. Counseling aims to strengthen the relationship by improving communication and trust.|$|E

Methods such as visual inspection, radiography, ultrasonic testing, phased-array ultrasonics, dye penetrant inspection, magnetic particle inspection, or industrial computed tomography <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> detection and analysis of certain defects.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no known}} cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks. Medications {{used to treat}} MS, while modestly effective, can have side effects and be poorly tolerated. Physical therapy <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> people's ability to function. Many people pursue alternative treatments, {{despite a lack of}} evidence. The long-term outcome is difficult to predict, with good outcomes more often seen in women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a relapsing course, and those who initially experienced few attacks. Life expectancy is on average 5 to 10 years lower than that of an unaffected population.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
