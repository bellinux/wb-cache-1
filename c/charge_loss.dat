30|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the Gd 2 O 3 -NC memories with a nanostructure tunneling layer comprising HfO 2 /Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2. When compared with devices comprising a single tunneling layer, these NC memories with a nanostructure tunneling layer exhibit a larger VFB shift and greater data retention because of the band alignment and the increased physical thickness of the tunneling layer. From the retention characteristics, {{it is observed that}} the activation energy is 0.13 to 0.17 eV for shallow-trap <b>charge</b> <b>loss</b> and 0.07 to 0.08 eV for deep-trap <b>charge</b> <b>loss.</b> Because the <b>charge</b> <b>loss</b> mechanism for the shallow trap is dominated by thermionic emission, the activation energy is higher than that for the <b>charge</b> <b>loss</b> mechanism of the deep trap, which is dominated by direct tunneling.

40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{advances in}} structure and material optimization, poor erase (E) speeds and high retention <b>charge</b> <b>loss</b> remain the challenging issues for charge trap Flash (CTF) memories. In this paper, {{the dependence of}} SANOS memory performance and reliability on the composition of silicon nitride (SiN) layer is extensively studied. The effect of varying the Si:N ratio on program (P) /E and retention characteristics is investigated. SiN composition is shown to significantly alter the electron and hole trap properties. Varying the SiN composition from N-rich (N(+)) to Si-rich (Si(+)) lowers electron trap depth but increases hole trap depth, causing lower P state saturation but significant over-erase, resulting in an enhanced memory window. During retention, P state <b>charge</b> <b>loss</b> depends on thermal emission followed by the tunneling out of electrons mostly through tunnel dielectric, which becomes worse for Si(+) SiN.
