50|$|Many common culturable {{laboratory}} strains are deep-frozen {{to preserve}} genetically and phenotypically stable, long-term stocks. Sub-culturing and prolonged refrigerated samples {{may lead to}} loss of plasmid(s) or mutations. Common final glycerol percentages are 15, 20 and 25. From a fresh culture plate, one single colony of interest is chosen and liquid culture is made. From the liquid culture, the medium is directly mixed with equal amount of glycerol; the colony should be checked for any defects like mutations. All antibiotics should be washed from the culture before long-term storage. Methods vary, but mixing can be done gently by inversion or rapidly by vortex and cooling can vary by either placing the <b>cryotube</b> directly at −50 to −95 °C, shock-freezing in liquid nitrogen or gradually cooling and then storing at −80 °C or cooler (liquid nitrogen or liquid nitrogen vapor). Recovery of bacteria can also vary, namely if beads are stored within the tube then the few beads {{can be used to}} plate or the frozen stock can be scraped with a loop and then plated, however, since only little stock is needed the entire tube should never be completely thawed and repeated freeze-thaw should be avoided. 100% recovery is not feasible regardless of methodology.|$|E

Then, in Detroit, the city is attacked by a small army of Decepticons lead by the Constructicon Mixmaster. Autobot second-in-command Ironhide is sent to destroy all Decepticons with the help of medical officer Ratchet. Ironhide kills most of the Decepticons and Mixmaster with an experimental rocket launcher, which was given by Wheeljack. Somewhere in South America, Sideswipe disappears in the jungle so Mirage is sent to meet Bumblebee, but he encounters the vicious Decepticon second-in-command Starscream and is knocked out by him by getting thrown through the ground. Mirage wakes up to find himself in the jungle after being knocked out and does not have his ability's to transform and use his weapons, but he does gets his abilities back after sneaking to a crashed NEST helicopter and get a supply drop containing his weaponry. He does find Sideswipe with the help of Bumblebee. Meanwhile, Megatron orders Soundwave to go to a former Sector Seven base on an island with Laserbeak. They find knowledge of a crash on the moon during the 1960s and an advanced technology called MechTech, which Soundwave destroys them by triggering a volcano eruption before escaping the base. Starscream is sent to Nepal to find and destroy the remaining MechTech that is about to be airlifted by the massive Aerialbot named Stratosphere from a NEST facility somewhere in the snowy mountain range. Then, he fights the other Aerialbots, consisting of Air Raid, Breakaway and Silverbolt. Starscream mercilessly kills them, along with Stratosphere who is carrying the technology and takes a piece of the MechTech. Starscream returns to the Decepticon base in Siberia, but he doesn't know that the Autobots put a tracker on the weapon he took.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{strategies}} {{have been used}} to reach non-attending women in organized cervical-cancer-screening programs, with varying success. Self-sampling (SS) for HPV is effective for increasing coverage in screening programs, but requires expensive commercial sampling kits. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate if vaginal SS, without commercial preservatives was adequate for HPV testing. STUDY DESIGN: Women with abnormal cervical smears as determined from the organized screening program were invited to a colposcopy clinic. The 121 women were asked to insert a cotton swab into the vagina and rotate it, put the cotton swab into a sterile <b>cryotube,</b> break {{the upper part of the}} stick and put the cap on. Thereafter, the gynaecologist collected a liquid based cytology (LBC) sample. The presence of HPV-types in SS and LBC samples was analysed with PCR and luminex-based typing. RESULTS: High-risk-HPV (hr-HPV) DNA was found in 65 of the tested 108 SS (60 %; 95 % CI 0. 50 - 0. 69), whereas LBC found hr-HPV in 64 / 108 samples (59 %; 95 % CI 0. 49 - 0. 69). The agreement between sampling with SS and LBC was good, kappa value 0. 67 (95 % CI; 0. 53 - 0. 81). The sensitivity for SS with hr-HPV to find HSIL was 81 % (95 % CI; 67 - 95 %), specificity 49 % (95 % CI; 37 - 60 %) and the sensitivity for LBC with hr-HPV to find HSIL was 90 % (95 % CI 80 - 100 %), specificity 53 % (95 % CI; 42 - 65 %). CONCLUSIONS: This new vaginal self-sampling method detects hr-HPV-infections with similar sensitivity as a cervical smear taken by a gynaecologist.

40|$|Background. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are {{increasingly}} used for clinical applications in equine patients. For MSC isolation and expansion, a laboratory step is mandatory, {{after which the}} cells are {{sent back to the}} attending veterinarian. Preserving the biological properties of MSCs during this transport is paramount. The goal {{of the study was to}} compare transport-related parameters (transport container, media, temperature, time, cell concentration) that potentially influence characteristics of culture expanded equine MSCs. Methods. The study was arranged in three parts comparing (I) five different transport containers (<b>cryotube,</b> two types of plastic syringes, glass syringe, CellSeal), (II) seven different transport media, four temperatures (4 °C vs. room temperature; − 20 °C vs. − 80 °C), four time frames (24 h vs. 48 h; 48 h vs. 72 h), and (III) three MSC concentrations (5 × 106, 10 × 106, 20 × 106 MSC/ml). Cell viability (Trypan Blue exclusion; percent and total number viable cell), proliferation and trilineage differentiation capacity were assessed for each test condition. Further, the recovered volume of the suspension was determined in part I. Each condition was evaluated using samples of six horses (n = 6) and differentiation protocols were performed in duplicates. Results. In part I of the study, no significant differences in any of the parameters were found when comparing transport containers at room temperature. The glass syringe was selected for all subsequent evaluations (highest recoverable volume of cell suspension and cell viability). In part II, media, temperatures, or time frames had also no significant influence on cell viability, likely due to the large number of comparisons and small sample size. Highest cell viability was observed using autologous bone marrow supernatant as transport medium, and “transport” at 4 °C for 24 h (70. 6 % vs. control group 75. 3 %); this was not significant. Contrary, viability was unacceptably low (< 40 %) for all freezing protocols at − 20 °C or − 80 °C, particularly with bone marrow supernatant or plasma and DMSO. In part III, various cell concentrations also had no significant influence on any of the evaluated parameters. Chondrogenic differentiation showed a trend towards being decreased for all transport conditions, compared to control cells. Discussion. In this study, transport conditions were not found to impact viability, proliferation or ability for trilineage differentiation of MSCs, most likely due to the small sample size and large number of comparisons. The unusual low viability after all freezing protocols is in contrast to previous equine studies. Potential causes are differences in the freezing, but also in thawing method. Also, the selected container (glass syringe) may have impacted viability. Future research may be warranted into the possibly negative effect of transport on chondrogenic differentiation...|$|E
40|$|Cryopreservation {{of human}} ovarian tissue is one {{approach}} to preserve fertility {{for women who}} can be predicted to undergo premature ovarian failure {{as a consequence of}} chemotherapy, radiotherapy or genetic disorders. It is the most suitable option for pre- pubertal girls and for many young women to store oocytes. To date, auto- transplantation of frozen- thawed cortical tissues has resulted in birth of 24 healthy children, worldwide. Cryopreservation can be performed using slow freezing or vitrification. Vitrification is known as solidification without formation of lethal intracellular ice crystals. The aim of this thesis was to further develop methods for cryopreserving follicles in human ovarian tissue of women who have a risk of losing their fertility. In the first study, we systematically compared two cryopreservation methods for human ovarian cortical tissue, slow freezing and vitrification. Cryoprotectants we used for slow freezing were either 1, 2 - propanediol (PrOH) - sucrose or ethylene glycol (EG) - sucrose. For vitrification, we used solutions containing a combination of the cryoprotectants dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), PrOH, EG and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Light microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and post- thaw tissue culture were carried out to evaluate the structure and the viability of the follicles. The follicles were well preserved and the ovarian stroma showed better morphological integrity after vitrification. In the second study, we developed a clinical grade vitrification of human ovarian tissue. Ovarian tissue was vitrified in a closed system without any direct contact with liquid nitrogen using a non-toxic and sterile <b>cryotube.</b> Vitrification solutions used contained a combination of cryoprotectants DMSO, PrOH, EG and PVP. The morphology of the follicles in the vitrified tissue, showed well -preserved structures as verified by LM, TEM and also after post -thaw culture. The system used is compatible with the European tissue directive and the Swedish tissue law. In the third article, we studied the occurrence of apoptosis in vitrified tissues. We used Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and DNA fragmentation analysis, which showed no incidence of apoptosis in follicles or stroma after using either vitrification solution (i. e., a combination of DMSO, PrOH, EG and PVP, or EG and bovine serum albumin (BSA). In the fourth one, we performed a study to simplify our earlier described closed vitrification procedure. Permeating cryoprotectants used in vitrification solutions consisted either of a combination of DMSO, PrOH, EG or EG only. Ovarian tissue was vitrified in closed sealed tubes containing either of the vitrification solutions. Morphological analysis (LM and TEM) showed that oocytes, granulosa cells and stroma were equally well preserved when either of the vitrification solutions was used. No apoptosis was observed in primordial and primary follicles using immunohistochemistry for active caspase- 3. Conclusion: Hereby we present new vitrification procedures that can be performed in a clinical setting. The morphology of follicles in the ovarian tissue as evaluated by using LM and TEM proved to be normal after the procedures. Ultra-structural analysis by TEM used in this study is the best- known method to evaluate cryoinjury.

40|$|Authors: Dieter Egli & Gloryn Chia ### Abstract Here we {{describe}} detailed methods that {{allowed us to}} derive embryonic stem cell lines by nuclear transfer of fibroblasts from a newborn and from a type 1 diabetic adult. The protocol {{is based on the}} insight that 1) agents for cell fusion can act as potent mediators of oocyte activation by compromising maintaining plasma membrane integrity; minimizing the concentration at which they are used, and at least transiently remove calcium from the medium can improve developmental potential. 2) and on the insight that an efficient stimulus for oocyte activation is required; 3) and that histone deacetylase inhibitors facilitate reprogramming after nuclear transfer. A realistic expectation is that this protocol will result in about 10 % of the oocytes developing to the blastocyst stage, most of which will be suitable for stem cell derivation. While most aspects of the protocol can be well controlled, variation in developmental efficiency when using oocytes of different donors should be expected. Note: this protocol is a guideline that allows ES cell derivation after somatic cell nuclear transfer. The author strongly discourages the use of this protocol or aspects of it in attempts for human reproductive cloning. ### Introduction The derivation of embryonic stem cell lines by somatic cell nuclear transfer yields stem cells that are genetically identical to the donor of the somatic cell nucleus. In the late ’ 90 s, it was proposed that such cells might be useful to generate replacement cells and tissues, a concept referred to as ‘therapeutic cloning’ [1, 2]. Although nuclear transfer in many animal species had been successful for several years [3], establishing a nuclear transfer protocol in human eggs proved to be more challenging. One aspect impeding progress was the ability to procure high-quality human oocytes. Only few groups had access to oocytes for stem cell research. The publication of guidelines on oocyte donation for research by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) [4, 5], by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) [6], and by the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority in the UK 7, as well as the demonstration that recruitment of oocyte donors without any form of compensation was not practical [8], paved the way for compensated oocyte donation programs in both the United States [9, 10] and in Britain [11]. Besides the logistical limitations to obtain good quality oocytes, several lines of evidence suggested that protocols resulting in efficient development to the blastocyst stage in various mammalian species were either not efficient or failed entirely when applied to human oocytes. Researchers working with Advanced Cell Technology reported developmental arrest at the cleavage stage after somatic cell nuclear transfer [12 - 14], and though parthenogenetic blastocysts could be obtained, they were of poor quality and did not result in embryonic stem cell lines [15]. Another group at Seoul National University in South Korea also had access to a significant number of high-quality human oocytes, and was able to derive a parthenogenetic embryonic stem cell line. Originally reported as a nuclear transfer ES cell line, others discovered that the cell line was of parthenogenetic origin [16]. Apparently, oocyte enucleation followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer did not result in development that would allow ES cell derivation. Other groups similarly reported difficulties in obtaining development beyond the cleavage stage following somatic cell nuclear transfer, though not all had access to high quality human oocytes [9, 17 - 21], and few used stringent standards to genotype the embryos obtained. The protocols used for nuclear transfer were all reminiscent of protocols that had been established using sheep or cow oocytes [22]: the use of somatic cell fusion by an electrical pulse, followed by oocyte activation with a calcium ionophore and the kinase inhibitor 6 -dimethylaminopurine (6 -DMAP) had been successful in sheep and in bovine [22, 23], but was apparently very inefficient with human oocytes. And even modifications that had resulted in rhesus macaque nuclear transfer ES cell lines [24], including the use of spindle birefringence instead of Hoechst and UV for oocyte enucleation [25], did not significantly improve development after human somatic cell nuclear transfer [9]. Initially shown to increase developmental potential after nuclear transfer in mouse oocytes [26, 27], histone deacetylase inhibitors also appeared to improve development after somatic cell nuclear transfer in human oocytes [28]. Further improvement in developmental potential was observed when calcium ionophore used for oocyte activation was substituted with an electrical pulse, resulting in the derivation of diploid ES cell lines after nuclear transfer of fetal (embryonic) fibroblasts [29]. Here {{we describe}} methods that allowed the derivation of nuclear transfer ES cell lines from fibroblasts of a newborn and of an adult type 1 diabetic. ### Materials 1.

Allow somatic cells to reach confluence. Change medium every 2 - 3 days. The cells will be confluent about 5 days before the experiment and less than 0. 5 % should be in S-phase {{at the time of the}} nuclear transfer experiment. The number of S-phase cells can be determined by EdU staining. **Media Preparation** Media Preparation is as described in Reference [30] and provided here for convenience. Preparation of master salts: Begin with 980 mL ultrapure H 2 O in sterile 1 L bottle. Add dry components: NaCl 4760 mg (81 mM) Sigma S- 5886, KCl 360 mg (5 mM) Sigma P- 5405, MgSO 4 • 7 H 2 O 290 mg (1. 18 mM) Sigma M- 2773, KH 2 PO 4 160 mg (1. 17 mM) Sigma P- 5655, EDTA 2 NA 40 mg (0. 1 mM) Sigma E- 6635, Glucose (D) 1000 mg (5. 5 mM) Sigma G- 6152. Add liquid Components: Na-lactate (lactic acid) 5. 3 mL Sigma 44263, Pen’Strep 10 mL Gibco 15140 - 122. For preparation of calcium-free HCZB: Start with 500 mL master salts. Add 50 mg polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (cold-soluble; Sigma P- 8136). Stir for 30 - 60 min and sterile filter. Use 99 ml of this mixture to add Hepes-Na 520 mg Sigma H- 3784 and NaHCO 3 42 mg Sigma S- 5761. Swirl until dissolved. Adjust pH to 7. 5 with 1 N HCl. Add 1 ml of HSA solution. Sterile filter. For preparation of calcium-free mCZB: To 99 ml master salts, add NaHCO 3 211 mg Sigma S- 5761, Na-pyruvate (pyruvic acid) 3 mg Sigma P- 4562, L-Glutamine 15 mg Sigma G- 8540, add 1 ml HSA solution, Swirl until all components are dissolved. Sterile filter. Check pH after equilibrating in CO 2 atmosphere. **Oocyte manipulations** 1. Retrieval: Oocytes are retrieved 35 hours post induction of ovulation. Oocyte handling and preparation, including removal of cumulus cells, is best done according to established practice at your IVF center. - Transport: If manipulation occurs in a different facility than oocyte retrieval, oocytes can be transported (e. g. by car or train) in a portable incubator heated to 37 °C. The incubator is turned on 1 h before retrieval, with the tubes loaded in the incubator, so it has at least 1 hour to equilibrate temperature. Tubes inside the incubator may be ThermoScientific <b>CryoTube</b> vials loaded with 1 ml- 1. 5 ml of G-MOPS PLUS. Caffeine at 1 mM may be added to this medium. Quality controls of the temperature of the incubator should be confirmed prior to the experiment with a temperature probe. A quality control run with mouse oocytes is also highly recommended. Our transport time was between 20 and 30 minutes. If oocytes are transported, two people are required to carry out the experiment. One person picks up the oocytes, while the other prepares the micromanipulator. - Preparations: set up 4 - 6 4 -well Dishes containing 0. 75 ml Global medium each well the night before the experiment to equilibrate in the incubator at 37 degree Celsius, 5 - 6 % CO 2. Dishes are used for washes, and temporary storage during the manipulation. In the early morning, the micromanipulator is prepared, with humagen needles attached and oosight system started and a background image taken. Prepare approximately 10 capillaries by pulling them over a Bunsen burner, then cut the capillaries with the engraving pen (See Movie). These should be changed frequently during the manipulations to avoid medium carry over and stickiness. Manipulation dishes (Matek glass dishes) are set up by adding 1) one drop of PVP, where the manipulation needles can be lubricated, 2) three drops of Globaltotal w Hepes medium containing 5 μg/ml cytochalasinB, 3) one drop of Sendai virus diluted in suspension buffer 1 : 10 to 1 : 20, and 4) three drops of calcium-free HCZB (Figure 1). The cytochalasinB (CytoB) containing medium is used for oocyte enucleation, the CytoB free medium for nuclear transfer. Caffeine at 1 mM may be added to both enucleation and transfer solutions. Warm up the up the dishes on the heated stage before placing oocytes in them. PVP is used to lubricate the pipettes. Aspirate a small amount of PVP and expel it again. There should be little PVP left in the pipette. When the pipette gets sticky during manipulation, repeat this process, or exchange the pipette. Confluent somatic cells are trypsinized using TrypLE resuspended in medium containing DMEM, 10 % Standard FBS, spun down and placed on ice in about 50 μl of medium. - Manipulation: Upon arrival, take oocytes out of the vials using a 1 ml tips on a Gilson pipette, and placed in a 30 mm dish on the heated stage of a Stereomicroscope. Oocytes are then placed in the equilibrated medium of the 4 -well dishes and placed in the incubator at 37 degree Celsius and 5 % CO 2 (or 6 % CO 2, 89 % N 2, 5 % O 2). 2 - 3 oocytes are placed on the stage heated to 37 degree Celsius, in cytochalasinB free medium and the zona is drilled using the Lykos laser near the spindle visualized by birefringence (25). Drilling is performed at low laser power, of 200 μs, 90 % power. The drilling in the absence of cytochalasinB serves to prevent oocyte leakage. Two small openings in the zona pellucida are made 90 - 180 degrees apart from each other. The first polar body may be ablated using 2 - 3 direct laser pulses or removed at this point to avoid later confusion with the somatic cell to be transferred. The oocyte is then transferred into cytochalasinB containing medium (5 μg/ml), turned until a spindle can be visualized using microtubule birefringence (Oosight), the zona is again drilled with the laser to gain access to the spindle. Be careful to have the spindle, the focus of the laser on the zona and the enucleation pipette all in the same plane of focus. If this is not the case, the spindle cannot be removed or seems to be moving away from the pipette when trying to aspirate it. After enucleation, oocytes are allowed to recover for 5 - 10 minutes from the cytochalasinB prior to fusion. CytochalasinB makes the cytoplasm look uneven, but is reversible within a few minutes. They may be washed in Global medium and returned to the incubator, or left on the heated stage the drops without cytochalasinB. While recovering from cytochalasinB, a new batch of 2 - 3 oocytes is enucleated. Nuclear transfer is performed as follows: a small drop of somatic cells is placed in one of the cytochalasinB free drops. Enucleated oocytes are placed in calcium-free medium. One somatic cell is aspirated into the pipette, and exposed to the virus for 10 - 20 s (Figure 2 a). There is no need to expel the somatic cell entirely. They become very sticky and more difficult to handle if they are expelled entirely. Fusogenic agents like Sendai virus act by affecting the integrity of the plasma membrane, and therefore increase permeability to ions contained in the culture medium. The membrane of a cell becomes more fragile when exposed to Sendai virus and the cell is prone to undergo lysis. This adverse effect of the virus lasts longer than the immediate time of incubation with the virus. Therefore, the minimal amount of fusogenic agent required to achieve fusion is recommended, to preserve integrity of the plasma membrane of the oocyte as much as possible, while still achieving fusion. To minimize exposure of the egg to the virus, do not expose the holding pipette to the virus and on the way back to the drop containing the oocytes, pass through another drop to get rid of excess virus. Drill the zona and make a very small opening (Figure 2 b), insert the somatic cell with the side exposed to the virus facing the plasma membrane, and ensure that the zona pellucida presses on the somatic cell to ensure contact between the somatic plasma membrane and the oocyte plasma membrane. If the somatic cell is GFP positive, fusion can usually be confirmed within 5 minutes by briefly checking the fluorescence in the oocyte. The oocyte is returned to the incubator in calcium-free medium for up to 1 h. Checkpoint: the investigator may want to fix a few oocytes to determine chromosome condensation. Before activation, the oocyte is returned to Global total for at least 10 minutes. - Activation: activate oocytes within approximately an hour or two post-transfer using an electrical pulse as described (29). Before delivering the pulse, wash the oocytes through two drops of fusion medium containing d-sorbitol (0. 25 M), 0. 1 mM calcium acetate, 0. 5 mM magnesium acetate, 0. 5 mM HEPES, and 1 mg/ml BSA (Sigma A 7030). They are ready for the electrical pulse when they sink to the bottom of the drop containing fusion medium. The presence of several zona openings avoids leaking out of the oocytes and possible loss. Oocytes are pulsed using an LF 201 pulser (Nepagene) set to deliver two times 2 pulses of 50 μs width at 2. 7 kV/cm in a CUY 5000 P 1 fusion chamber (time between pulses, 1 s). The Thereafter oocytes are washed in Global total and cultured in Global total containing 10 μM puromycin, 2 mM 6 -DMAP, as well as the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors scriptaid (250 nM, Sigma S 7817) and nch- 51 (1 μM, Tocris Bioscience 3747) (trichostatin A at 10 nM may likely be used instead of the former two), for 3. 5 - 4 hours. Formation of small pronuclei should be apparent at 4 hours. Wash oocytes through 2 wells of medium to eliminate compounds used for oocyte activation. - Culture: culture activated constructs in HDAC inhibitor for an additional 10 - 14 hours, followed by culture in Global total medium until day 1. On day 1 in the early morning, pronuclei are monitored again. New 4 -well dishes are set up for equilibration containing Global medium containing 10 % FBS (quality controlled by the investigator for compatibility with clonal human ES cell growth). Cleaved oocytes are transferred into this new medium. On day 3, cleaved oocytes are again transferred to fresh medium. Developmental progression may be monitored every day, by briefly placing dishes on the heated stage of the microscope. Avoid evaporation of the medium while viewing. - Derivation: Derive in the evening of day 6 or in the morning of day 7 after nuclear transfer. About 70, 000 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) per well of a 4 -well dish are seeded 3 - 4 hours before derivation in warm fibroblast medium on a surface that had been coated for approximately 10 minutes with 0. 1 % gelatin. Time before derivation is just sufficient for the MEFs to attach to the bottom of a 4 -well dish and spread out. The MEF layer should cover all plastic, but should not be dense. The timing of derivation from blastocysts should be on day two after blastulation is first observed. Trophectoderm cells are ablated with laser pulses at 400 μs pulses, 90 % power, as described (31). No more than one pulse per cell is applied, and not all trophectoderm cells need to be ablated. If the blastocyst did not hatch from the zona pellucida on its own, laser pulses may be used to ablate the zona pellucida with gentle pipetting to remove remaining pieces. Plating is conducted in medium containing KnockOut DMEM/F 12 supplemented with 10 % Knockout-SR and 10 % quality-tested FBS, 10 μM Rock inhibitor Y- 27632, 2 μM thiazovivin, non-essential amino acids (1 %), 10 ng/ml bFGF, Glutamax (1 %), PennStrep (1 %), and 1 × 2 -mercaptoethanol. Two days after plating, remaining trophectoderm cells are ablated using laser pulses at 400 μs pulses, 90 % power, which may be repeated until most trophectoderm cells are gone (see Extended Data Figure 5 of Reference [32]. Trophectoderm cells are rather flat and large and may inhibit growth of inner cell mass (ICM) cells. If the investigator cannot see ICM cells, or cannot distinguish them from trophectoderm, wait another day and check again. Outgrowths can be apparent as soon as 3 - 4 days after plating, but may take up to two and a half weeks to be fully-grown and ready for picking. Medium changes are partial every 1 - 2 days. Once an outgrowth is apparent, partial medium changes should be conducted without Y- 27632 or thiazovivin. Picking is done when colonies reach a size of about 1 mm in diameter and colony fragments are plated into 2 - 3 wells of a 4 -well dish coated with MEFs. MEFs must be fresh, meaning no older than 12 hours. If colonies emerge in several wells, enzymatic passaging may begin after just one manual passage. FBS-containing medium is gradually replaced by using standard ES cell medium (substituting FBS with Knockout-SR and DMEM/F 12 with Knockout-DMEM). Enzymatic passaging is done using 10 μM Rock inhibitor Y- 27632 for the first day after plating. - Verification: Quality control the cell lines derived, by analysis of pluripotency markers and differentiation potential. Protocols for performing such analysis are provided elsewhere. In addition, analyze the karyotype and the short tandem repeats of the nuclear transfer ES cell lines. There are commercially available services for doing that, such as at Cell Line Genetics in Madison, Wisconsin. The karyotype should be diploid. Short tandem repeats (STR) are unique genetic features that provide an identifier of the cell lines derived. For instance, in the associated Nature paper, in Extended Data Table 2, we provide the STR genotypes of all nuclear transfer ES cell lines. These were found to be an exact match to the STR genotype made on the somatic cells prior to nuclear transfer. An example, the somatic cells prior to nuclear transfer (ID 1018) is given here and as an attachment: Amelogenin X; vWA 16, 17; D 8 S 1179 10, 15; TPOX 8; FGA 25, 27; D 3 S 1358 15, 18; THO 1 9. 3; D 21 S 11 28, 30; D 18 S 51 13, 15; PentaE 12, 14; D 5 S 818 11, 13; D 13 S 317...|$|E

40|$|O presente trabalho tem como objetivo determinar o melhor mÃtodo de congelaÃÃo e envase de sÃmen humano, quando comparado o mÃtodo rÃpido com o lento e o envase em palhetas de 0, 25 ml com criotubos de 2 ml, utilizando como variÃveis a morfologia e motilidade dos espermatozÃides antes e apÃs a criopreservaÃÃo. Trata-se de um estudo experimental, de validaÃÃo de tÃcnica laboratorial. Foi desenvolvido no Centro de ReproduÃÃo Assistida do CearÃ. Foram analisadas dezoito amostras de sÃmen de dezoito voluntÃrios. As amostras foram submetidas Ã anÃlise da morfologia e motilidade espermÃtica prÃvia Ã criopreservaÃÃo. Foi determinada ainda uma curva de motilidade espermÃtica nas primeiras trÃs horas. O meio TEST-YOLK foi utilizado como crioprotetor. Depois de adicionado o crioprotetor, o sÃmen foi dividido em partes iguais e envasado em criotubos e palhetas. Metade dos criotubos e das palhetas foi submetida a criopreservaÃÃo pelo mÃtodo rÃpido (RT e RP, respectivamente) e a outra metade pelo mÃtodo lento (LT e LP, respectivamente). Em seguida, as amostras foram descongeladas e determinadas as morfologias, bem como as motilidades logo apÃs a descongelaÃÃo e a cada hora durante trÃs horas. AnÃlise estatÃstica foi realizada pelo programa de SPSS for Windows versÃo 11. 0. 0. Houve uma queda, estatisticamente significante, da motilidade apÃs a criopreservaÃÃo, motilidade inicial de 58, 1 % e motilidades nos diferentes tratamentos de 30, 3 % (LT), 21, 1 % (LP), 27 % (RT) e 19, 2 % (RP). TambÃm houve uma diminuiÃÃo significante da morfologia normal apÃs a criopreservaÃÃo, em relaÃÃo Ã morfologia inicial (14, 2 %), mas nÃo foi observada diferenÃa entre os mÃtodos (12, 8 %, 12, 6 %, 12, 6 % e 12, 4 %; RP, RT, LP e LT, respectivamente). O mÃtodo LT foi o que obteve uma curva de motilidade espermÃtica mais prÃxima da observada no sÃmen in natura. Conclui-se que o mÃtodo LT foi o que menos afetou a motilidade espermÃtica e que, apesar de ter sido observada uma piora significativa da morfologia espermÃtica apÃs a criopreservaÃÃo, nÃo houve diferenÃa entre os mÃtodos. Palavras-chaves: CriopreservaÃÃo; PreservaÃÃo do SÃmen; EspermatozÃide; ReproduÃÃoThis {{research}} has as objective determines the best freezing method and storage of human semen, when compared the fast method with the slow method and the storage in 0, 25 ml straws with <b>cryotubes</b> of 2 ml, using as variables the morphology and motility of the spermatozoa {{before and after}} the cryopreservation. It is an experimental study, laboratorial technique validation. It was developed in the Assisted Reproduction Center of CearÃ. Eighteen semen samples from eighteen men were analyzed. The samples were submitted to the analysis of the morphology and motility previous the cryopreservation. It was still determined a spermatozoa motility curve in the first three hours. TEST-YOLK was used as cryoprotective media. After having added the TEST-YOLK media, the semen was divided in same parts and storage in <b>cryotubes</b> and straws. Half of the <b>cryotubes</b> and of the straws was cryopreserved by the fast method (RT and RP, respectively) and the other half by the slow method (LT and LP, respectively). The samples were thawed and analyzed the morphologies, as well as the motilities soon after the thawed and every hour for three hours. Statistical analysis was done by the SPSS program - Windows version 11. 0. 0. Motility of spermatozoa decrease after the cryopreservation, initial motility was 58, 1 % and motilities in the different treatments were 30, 3 % (LT), 21, 1 % (LP), 27 % (RT) and 19, 2 % (RP). There was a significant decrease of the normal morphology after the cryopreservation, in relation to the initial morphology, but difference was not observed among the methods (RP= 12, 8 %, RT= 12, 6 %, LP= 12, 6 % e LT= 12, 4 %). The motility of LT method was closer than that obtained in the fresh semen. The method LT showed the best recovery of motile cells after freezing and thawing. There was not difference among the methods when appraised the morphology. Key-Word: Cryopreservation; Semen preservation; Spermatozoa; Reproduction...|$|R
40|$|Although {{vitrification}} and follicular survival {{subsequent to}} xenotransplantation of canine ovarian tissues have been reported, {{the degree of}} cryoinjury after the vitrification {{has not yet been}} fully examined. Since cryoinjury after vitrification of ovaries has been reported in bovine and humans, this study evaluated canine ovarian tissues after vitrification by immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay. Ovaries were collected from immature bitches. The ovarian tissue cubes were pretreated with 1 M DMSO. Subsequently, DAP 213 solution (2 M DMSO, 1 M acetamide, 3 M propylene glycol) was added. The <b>cryotubes</b> containing the ovarian tissues were placed on ice for 5 min, then plunged directly into liquid nitrogen. After warming with 0. 25 M sucrose, cryopreserved ovarian tissues were fixed and subsequently stained with hematoxylin-eosin, proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody, or active caspase- 3 (AC- 3) antibody, and evaluated by the TUNEL assay. There were no differences in the numbers of primordial, primary, secondary and antral follicles/mm 2 between the fresh and vitrified-warmed ovarian tissues. Percentages of PCNA and AC- 3 antibody positive cells were similar regardless of the developmental stage of the follicles and experimental group. A few TUNEL positive cells were detected in both experimental groups. These results suggest that vitrification with DAP 213 does not induce cryoinjury in ovarian tissues from immature bitches. c 2016 Japan Society for Ova Research...|$|R
