5000|$|Rack slides are {{specifically}} intended for <b>mounting</b> <b>equipment</b> into 19-inch racks or 23-inch racks. These can be friction bearing, ball bearing, or roller bearing. They are sized {{to fit into}} racks with mounting flanges on the ends to mate to the mounting holes in racks. In some cases, one mounting flange is formed into the rack slide with an adapter bracket attached {{to the other end}} to accommodate different depths of the rack. The outer fixed member is attached to the rack and the inner moving member is generally screwed {{to the side of the}} <b>mounted</b> <b>equipment.</b> Rack slides are typically compound or 3-part slides allowing full extension of the <b>mounted</b> <b>equipment</b> and generally include provision for sliding the inner member completely free to allow removal of the equipment from the rack. They can also include stops to prevent accidentally pulling the equipment out of the rack without releasing the stop mechanism.|$|R

5000|$|Bucyrus Foundry and Manufacturing Company {{entered the}} {{dragline}} market in 1910 with {{the purchase of}} manufacturing rights for the Heyworth-Newman dragline excavator. Their [...] "Class 14" [...] dragline was introduced in 1911 as the first <b>crawler</b> <b>mounted</b> dragline. In 1912 Bucyrus helped pioneer the use of electricity as a power source for large stripping shovels and draglines used in mining. An Italian company, Fiorentini, produced dragline excavators from 1919 licensed by Bucyrus. After the merger with Monighan in 1946, Bucyrus began producing much larger machines using the Monighan walking mechanism such as the 800 ton 650-B which used a 15-yard bucket. Bucyrus' largest dragline was Big Muskie built for the Ohio Coal Company in 1969. This machine featured a 220-yard bucket on a 450-foot boom and weighed 14,500 tons. Bucyrus was itself acquired by heavy equipment and diesel engine maker, Caterpillar, in 2011. Caterpillar's largest dragline is the 8750 with a 169-yard bucket, 435-foot boom, and 8,350 ton weight.|$|R
