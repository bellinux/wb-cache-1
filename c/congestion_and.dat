40|$|This paper {{explores the}} issue of fair {{allocation}} of excess network bandwidth between <b>congestion</b> sensitive <b>and</b> insensitive flows in an Assured Forwarding traffic class. In {{the absence of any}} mechanism to distinguish between out-ofprofile traffic of <b>congestion</b> sensitive <b>and</b> insensitive flows, <b>congestion</b> insensitive flows will get most of the excess network bandwidth. However, if out-of-profile packets of <b>congestion</b> sensitive <b>and</b> insensitive flows are 'colored' differently, network can be configured so as to give better treatment to excess packets of <b>congestion</b> sensitive flows <b>and</b> achieve fair allocation of excess network bandwidth. With a view to clearly distinguish between out-of-profile packets of <b>congestion</b> sensitive <b>and</b> insensitive flows, three levels of drop precedence are required. However, if the network operates close to its capacity, three levels of drop precedence are redundant as there is not much excess bandwidth to be shared...|$|R

The three messages are a transmission of an agent’s location <b>and</b> <b>congestion</b> (Location <b>and</b> <b>Congestion</b> Push), {{a request for}} congestion information about a specific road (Priority Road Information Pull Request), and a response for congestion information about a specific road (Priority Road Information Pull Response).|$|R
40|$|The left-turn of {{vehicles}} at intersections has significant impacts on urban traffic <b>congestions</b> <b>and</b> accidents, which have {{negative effect on}} vehicle emissions causing air pollution. Many urban traffic networks prohibit direct left-turns for transport planning to keep traffic moving efficiently on major roads. As such, this paper proposes a bi-level mathematical model for left-turn prohibition planning considering both travel times and traffic emissions. The lower-level and upper-level are respectively solved by using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and an improved genetic algorithm. By numerical examples, this paper shows that the improved algorithm can effectively enhance the speed and accuracy of the calculation, <b>and</b> the traffic <b>congestions</b> <b>and</b> emissions can be alleviated by implementing the left-turn prohibition at some carefully selected intersections. </p...|$|R

5|$|According to Transport for London (TfL), {{the station}} is at {{capacity}} {{because of the large}} number of passengers leaving and entering the station, as well as the large numbers of passengers changing between lines.

5|$|In 2006, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{converted}} NY376's intersections {{with the}} main gate of Vassar College and College Avenue into roundabouts. Both of the roundabouts replaced traffic lights. A traffic signal used to control traffic for a pedestrian crosswalk was also removed {{as part of their}} construction. Another roundabout was constructed in 2008 at Fulton and Collegeview Avenues. NYSDOT has called the installation of roundabouts a success, stating that it has significantly calmed traffic, decreased <b>congestion</b> <b>and</b> increased traffic flow.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{technological}} progress, the consumption of electric energy increases continuously. But the transmission systems are not extended {{to the same extent}} because building of new lines is difficult for environmental as well as political reasons. Hence, the systems are driven closer to their limits resulting in <b>congestions</b> <b>and</b> critical situations endangering the system security. Power Flow Control devices such as Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) provide the opportunity to inﬂuence power ﬂows and voltages and therefore to enhance system security, e. g. by resolving <b>congestions</b> <b>and</b> improving the voltage proﬁle.

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} cross-layer design of <b>congestion</b> control <b>and</b> power {{allocation}} with outage constraint in an interference-limited multihop wireless networks. The conventional method of joint <b>congestion</b> control <b>and</b> power control relies on static channel and high SIR (signal-to-interference ratio) assumption which achieves only suboptimal results. By using a novel successive convex approximations method, we can attain the global optimal source rates and link powers in a distributed fashion exploiting message passing. Through simulations, our method converges {{faster than the}} previous work based on logarithm successive convex approximations.
