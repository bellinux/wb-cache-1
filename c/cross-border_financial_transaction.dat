40|$|Money {{laundering}} issues {{started to}} {{receive much attention}} after the tragic event of 11 th September 2011. Developing countries such as Malaysia was identified by Pentagon {{as one of the}} countries where illegal funds travelled into the country in order to become legitimate. This had sent a strong signal to the Malaysian government that the country’s financial system is vulnerable to such money laundering activities. As a result Bank Negara Malaysia as the central bank of the country, had been assigned by the government to ensure the financial system is not used as a medium to launder money. This had led to the establishment of Bank Negara Malaysia Financial Intelligence Unit (BNM FIU) in 2002 which is responsible in receiving, analysing and disseminating financial intelligence information to the relevant law enforcement agencies in order to fight money laundering. The severity of money laundering is very much attributed to the factors such as globalisation, advancement of technology and communication, as well as <b>cross-border</b> <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> activities. As money laundering could be spread across countries, involving numerous jurisdictions, BNM FIU has an important role to ensure the severity of money laundering affecting the domestic financial players could be mitigated. In this context, international cooperation with other related international bodies such as the Financial Intelligence Units of other countries is deemed important for the benefit of exchanging and sharing of financial intelligence information. As international cooperation involves different jurisdictions and regulations, BNM FIU may face obstacle that may result in slower process of receiving and analysing the said information. Although such obstacle is unavoidable, the question is to what extent does BNM FIU {{play a major role in}} international cooperation? This could be seen in the actions taken by BNM FIU which include voluntarily disclosure of financial intelligence information, the signing of Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs), training and learning programmes to foreign counterparts as well as disclosure to foreign FIUs. In this context, comparison is also made between BNM FIU with other South East Asia region’s FIU in order to gauge their level of international cooperation. Although BNM FIU is regarded as one of the leading FIUs in the South East Asia region in terms of international cooperation, the declining trend involving voluntarily disclosure of financial intelligence information, signing of MOUs, as well as training and learning programmes to foreign counterparts within the period of year 2008 to 2011 is rather alarming. The interview with the Deputy Director of BNM FIU would highlight the reasons of such declining trend and why international cooperation is still an important criteria for BNM FIU in combatting money laundering on international basis...|$|E

We extend a novel panel data set containing measures of capital controls for the years 2005 - 2012, disaggregated by inflows and outflows. Private capital flows, which include net inflows, gross inflows, and gross outflows, are typically volatile for all countries. Using a fixed effects model we find that capital inflow restrictions are able to reduce gross inflow volatility, but we find little effect of outflow restrictions on gross outflow volatility. We find no strong evidence that institutional quality has an effect on capital flow volatility. Additionally, given the dynamics and individual country effects, we use the panel vector auto-regression approach to examine the effectiveness of capital outflow controls on gross outflow volatility and net inflow volatility. We find that a tightening of outflow controls increases net capital inflow volatility. These results emphasize the role of capital account restrictions on <b>cross-border</b> <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> We conclude that capital controls can affect the volatility of capital flows...|$|R

The euro's role in originating or catalysing trends has been uneven across the spectrum of financial markets. On the lender side, banks and investors in fixed income markets have become more focused on the characteristics of individual borrowers rather than the nationality of the issuer and have built up expertise to evaluate credit risk. European equity markets have also been affected by the enhanced ability of investors to build strategies with a pan-European perspective as prices increasingly reflected risk factors specific to industrial sectors rather than individual countries. On the borrower side, EMU has increased the attractiveness of market-based financing methods by allowing debt issuers to tap institutional portfolios across the euro area.

Indeed, while fixed income securities still account for the bulk of <b>cross-border</b> <b>financial</b> <b>transactions,</b> equities markets are playing an increasing role in such transactions. In 1995, cross-border transactions in bonds into and out of the United States amounted to 110 % of US GDP, more than five times the corresponding ratio for equity flows.

Financial Integration is a multidimensional process through which allocation of financial assets becomes lastly borderless.

The consequence of the U.

The results indicate that these four emerging markets had been considerable influenced by the U. S. market performance, regardless of crisis or non-crisis periods. Nevertheless, some countries like Indonesia and the Philippines acted differently during the pre-crisis and crisis sub-periods respectively due to their domestic market infrastructure and regulation adjustment. However, these two markets had eventually turned to share an interdependent long-run relationship with the U. S. equity market since the ending of the Subprime financial downturn. Moreover, this finding suggests that ongoing capital market integration in the Southeast Asian region would mitigate portfolio diversification benefits for investors by virtue of increasing in correlation among securities and assets.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the institutional preconditions for stable financial integration in a ‘theory of optimal financial areas’ (OFA). This theory is modelled on the theory of optimal currency areas {{that has been used}} to inform the process of monetary integration. Where it differs from optimum currency area (OCA) theory is in focussing on capital mobility and <b>cross-border</b> <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> rather than concentrating on exchange rates or macroeconomic adjustment. We contend that OCA theory misdirects both the analysis and the policy response: it is more pertinent to ask what makes for financial stability under conditions of market integration than what makes for stable currencies and smooth macroeconomic adjustment. The article proposes six ‘criteria’ that should be met in order to stabilize an integrated financial ‘market geography’. Three of these criteria relate to the technical substructure of markets, and include a shared risk free asset, centralized sovereign debt management, and common market infrastructures for communication, clearing, settlement and depository. Three further criteria focus on the macro-prudential considerations like shared rules for financial supervision, centralized lender of last resort facilities for private- and public-sector market participants, and common provision for the resolution of failed private- and public-sector borrowers. These criteria are controversial both individually and as an interdependent package. Nevertheless, they are important to mitigate the costly dynamics of financial market disintegration under crisis conditions. We use case studies of the Great Britain, the United States and Canada to show how national governments have stumbled toward a similar set of arrangements to stabilize domestic financial market integration. The more recent experience of the European Union shows this pattern applies across countries as well. We conclude with a research agenda based on these considerations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} link between capital account {{openness}} and the output cost associated with a currency crisis. Although the Malaysian experience during the Asian crisis of 1997 - 98 made many researchers and policy makers interested in {{the effectiveness of a}} policy restricting <b>cross-border</b> <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> to minimize the output cost, this association has not been exposed to a thorough empirical investigation. The probit analysis in this paper shows that the higher the level of financial openness is, the less likely countries are to experience a currency crisis among industrialized and less developed countries. It is found that a higher level of financial openness prior to a crisis helps to reduce output losses for industrialized countries, but not for less developed or emerging market countries. It is also shown that the duration of post-crisis output contraction can be shorter when an industrialized country has a high level of financial openness, but for the group of EMGs the duration of output contraction can be lengthened if a country has more open capital accounts. However, once the country encounters a currency crisis, the effect of capital account openness differs depending on the level of development. The post-crisis level of financial openness helps industrialized countries to reduce the magnitude of output losses while it increases post-crisis output losses for emerging market and less developed countries. A higher rate of financial liberalization is also found to be detrimental to less developed countries. When the dynamics of output gaps after a crisis are investigated, it is found that the negative effect of a higher level of capital account openness lasts {{for at least three years}} for emerging market countries. In general, I have found that institutional development such as corruption, law and order, and bureaucratic quality, rather than the level of openness in financial markets, is important in lowering the size of post-crisis output losses for the groups of less developed or emerging market countries. Only the group of IDCs appears to be able to reap the effect of capital account liberalization in terms of reducing the size of post-crisis output losses.

40|$|Worldwide {{financial}} markets increasingly depend on structures that reduce risk by interposing intermediaries between investors {{and the companies}} obligated to pay them. This reduction of risk may be offset, however, by the risk that an intermediary will fail, and its creditors then will claim against assets held by the intermediary {{for the benefit of}} investors. If the intermediary holds assets solely in a custodial capacity, this risk traditionally is addressed by agency and trust law. What is novel, however, is that intermediaries in a wide rang of domestic and international dealings- including the trading of investment securities, the sale of loan participants, and securitization transactions- now hold assets in which they, as well as investors, share beneficial rights. The sharing of these rights creates significant uncertainty as to whether the intermediary 2 ̆ 7 s creditors can look to all those assets, or merely to the intermediary 2 ̆ 7 s interest therein, for repayment.

More targeted remedies to drive out socially undesirable transactions should be sought in parallel, which would allow, after their implementation, to reduce or even phase out <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> taxes. transaction tax, Tobin tax, <b>financial</b> <b>transactions,</b> global <b>financial</b> crisis, financial regulation...|$|R
