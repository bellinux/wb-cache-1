50|$|Cerebral {{achromatopsia}} is {{a chronic}} condition {{where a person}} is unable to see colour, {{but they are still}} able to recognize shape and form. Cerebral achromatopsia differs from congenital achromatopsia in that it is caused by damage to the cerebral cortex as opposed to abnormalities in the retinal cells. The search for the <b>colour</b> <b>centre</b> was motivated by the discovery that lesions in the ventral occipital lobe led to colour blindness, as well as the idea that there are area specializations in the cortex. Many studies have shown that lesions in the areas commonly identified as the <b>colour</b> <b>centre,</b> such as V1, V2, and the V4-complex lead to achromatopsia. Cerebral achromatopsia occurs after injury to the lingual or fusiform gyrus, the areas associated with hV4. These injuries include physical trauma, stroke, and tumour growth. One of the primary initiatives to locating the <b>colour</b> <b>centre</b> in the visual cortex is to discover the cause and a possible treatment of cerebral achromatopsia.|$|E

50|$|The <b>colour</b> <b>centre</b> is {{a region}} in the brain {{primarily}} responsible for visual perception and cortical processing of colour signals received by the eye, which ultimately results in colour vision.

Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in both humans and macaque monkeys have shown colour stimuli to activate multiple areas in the brain, including the fusiform gyrus and the lingual gyrus. These areas, as well as others identified as having a role in colour vision processing, are collectively labelled visual area 4 (V4).

50|$|Anatomical and {{physiological}} studies have {{established that the}} <b>colour</b> <b>centre</b> begins in V1 and sends signals to extrastriate areas V2 and V4 for further processing.

Originally, it was proposed that colour was selectively processed in V4. However, this hypothesis was later rejected in favour of another hypothesis which suggested that V4 and other areas around V4 work together to process colour in the form of multiple colour selective regions. After identification of V4 as the colour-selective region in macaque monkeys, scientists began searching for a homologous structure in the human cortex. Using fMRI brain imaging, scientists found three main areas stimulated by colour: V1, an area in the ventral occipital lobe, specifically the lingual gyrus, which was designated as human V4, or hV4, and another area located anteriorly in the fusiform gyrus, designated as V4Î±.|$|E
