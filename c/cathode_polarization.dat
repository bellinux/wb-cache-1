The microscopic analysis was performed using SEM methods. The electrical characterization was performed by taking current-voltage measurements over a range of temperatures between 650 and 840 ◦C with hydrogen as fuel, and air as oxidant. The analysis of performance showed that at 740 ◦C the voltage of 700 mV is reached at around a double value of current density {{in the case of}} ASC 2.

When pure hydro-gen gas {{was used as a}} fuel, the polarizations under load were homogeneous in the plane of the cell. However, when the re-formate gas was used, inhomogeneity in the plane arose under load. The cathode and anode potentials hifted in the posi-tive direction at the fuel outlet area. The potential shifts increased with an increase of fuel utilization or due to CO poisoning. The voltage loss due to CO poisoning (CO loss) caused an increase not only of the anode polarization but also of the <b>cathode</b> <b>polarization</b> in the fuel inlet area. The increase of <b>cathode</b> <b>polarization</b> at the fuel inlet area was due to current convergence into the fuel inlet area.
