25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E
500|$|Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Donlevy reprised {{his role}} as the eponymous professor, much to the despair of Nigel Kneale, who had heavily criticised his {{interpretation}} of the role in The Quatermass Xperiment. As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment, Donlevy's alcoholism presented challenges for the production. Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day: “He [...] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up. He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around. They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said, “What's this movie called?” and they said, “Well, it's called Quatermass 2”. He said, “I've got to say all that? There's too much talk. Cut down some of the talk”. He tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go, so crippled with drink he hardly knew who he was”. Val Guest has denied Kneale's claims, saying “So many stories have been concocted since, about how he was a paralytic. It's absolute balls, because he was not paralytic. He wasn't stone cold sober either, but he was a pro and he knew his lines”. Guest also recalled, “By after lunch he would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> say “Give me a breakdown of the story so far. Where have I just been before this scene?” We used to feed him black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it. But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with”.|$|E

2500|$|NBC's final Major League Baseball {{broadcast}} was televised on October 9, 1989; Game 5 of the National League Championship Series {{between the}} San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs from Candlestick Park. Vin Scully said [...] "It's a passing {{of a great}} American tradition. It is sad. I really and truly feel that.

[...] "I had one woman <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> say 'Mr. VanDerZee my friends tell that's a nice picture, but it doesn't look like you.' That was my style." [...] Said VanDerZee. VanDerZee sometimes combined several photos in one image, for example by adding a ghostly child to an image of a wedding to suggest the couple's future, or by superimposing a funeral image upon a photograph of a dead woman to give the feeling of her eerie presence. VanDerZee said, [...] "I wanted to make the camera take what I thought should be there." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Ott {{become the}} {{ambassador}} to Japan in April 1938, Sorge had a breakfast with him everyday {{where the two}} discussed in detail German-Japanese relations, and Sorge sometimes drafted the cables that Ott sent under his name to Berlin. Ott trusted Sorge {{so much that he}} sent him out as a German courier to carry secret messages to the German consulates in Canton, Hong Kong, and Manila. Sorge himself noted about his influence in the German Embassy: [...] "They would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> say, 'we have found out such and such a thing, have you heard about it and what do you think?'". Of all of Sorge's various relationships with women, the most durable and lastingly was with a Japanese woman Hanako Ishii who tried to curb Sorge's heavy drinking and his habit of recklessly riding his motorcycle around the Japanese countryside in a manner that everyone viewed as almost suicidal.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 March 2005 {{following}} a urinary tract infection, he developed septic shock, {{a form of}} infection with a high fever and low blood pressure, but was not hospitalised. Instead, he was monitored {{by a team of}} consultants at his private residence. This was taken as an indication by the pope, and those close to him, that he was nearing death; it would have been in accordance with his wishes to die in the Vatican. Later that day, Vatican sources announced that John Paul II had been given the Anointing of the Sick by his friend and secretary Stanisław Dziwisz. The day before his death, one of his closest personal friends, Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka visited him at his bedside. During {{the final days of the}} pope's life, the lights were kept burning through the night where he lay in the Papal apartment on the top floor of the Apostolic Palace. Tens of thousands of people assembled and held vigil in St. Peter's Square and the surrounding streets for two days. Upon hearing of this, the dying pope was said to have stated: [...] "I have searched for you, and now you have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I thank you." ...|$|E

As a result much of the Quran will be gone. [...] " [...] 'I am therefore of the opinion that you should command the Quran be collected.'" [...] Abu Bakr continued, [...] "I said to 'Umar, 'How can we embark on what the Prophet never did?' 'Umar replied that it was a good deed regardless, and he did not cease replying to my scruples until Allah reconciled me to the undertaking, and I became of the same mind as him. Zaid, you are young and intelligent, you used to record the revelations for Muhammad, and we know nothing to your discredit. So pursue the Quran and collect it together." [...] By Allah, had they asked me to move a mountain it could not have been weightier than what they requested of me now".

2500|$|Ribbentrop was a {{defendant}} at the Nuremberg Trials. The Allies' International Military Tribunal convicted him on four counts: crimes against peace, deliberately planning {{a war of}} aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. According to the judgment, Ribbentrop was actively involved in planning the invasions of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. He was also {{deeply involved in the}} [...] "final solution"; as early as 1942 he had ordered German diplomats in Axis countries to hasten the process of sending Jews to death camps in the east. He supported the lynching of Allied airmen shot down over Germany, and helped to cover up the 1945 murder of Major-General Gustave Mesny, a French officer being held as a prisoner of war. He was held directly responsible for atrocities that took place in Denmark and Vichy France, since the top officials in those two occupied countries reported to him. Ribbentrop claimed that Hitler made all of the important decisions, and that he had been deceived by Hitler's repeated claims that he only wanted peace. The Tribunal rejected this argument, saying that given how closely involved Ribbentrop was with the execution of the war, [...] "he could not have remained unaware of the aggressive nature of Hitler's actions." [...] Even in prison, Ribbentrop remained loyal to Hitler: [...] "Even with all I know, if in this cell Hitler should <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> say 'Do this!', I would still do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics on {{the record}} were {{described}} by the band members as [...] "a collaborative psycho-therapy session wherein personal demons of various sizes and importance are exorcised, vilified, taken revenge upon and laid to rest." [...] Vig said they tried to deal with [...] "dark themes that I {{think a lot of}} people can relate to in some way or another", which included voyeurism, hedonism, perversion, obsession and [...] "the art of self-destruction." [...] Manson stated that even though she put together most of the songs, [...] "everybody has ideas that come to the table and I just use what I fancy. When we're working on something, the lyrics take a while to work on and [...] <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> say 'I've had these ideas, use them if you want' and if there's something I like, I'll stick it in with my own, or vice-versa. Some people come in going 'I've got this great title for a song' and I might use that." [...] Manson remarked that while the content was [...] "a lot more poppy" [...] than most of her previous work, the songs invoked the dark side of her nature, as [...] "sometimes I'm a bit wee creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music." [...] She also declared that music [...] "unlocks sensations and feelings that you keep inside, that society doesn't allow you to show", saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like [...] "Vow" [...] is very real despite [...] "none of us hav ever really acted on those feelings". Vig added that the band was eager to exploit the contrast between words and music: [...] "The initial idea was to make this a dark lyric with a shiny, happy, pop sensibility. You could be singing this really catchy line and realize the lyrics were totally wacked." ...|$|E
