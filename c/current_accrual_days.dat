40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} long-run underperformance of convertible bond issuers {{can be explained}} by earnings management, as reflected in discretionary <b>current</b> <b>accruals</b> {{around the time of the}} offer. Consistent with the earnings management hypothesis, we find that convertible issuers who adjust their discretionary <b>current</b> <b>accruals</b> to report higher net income in the issue year will generally experience inferior operating and stock return performance over the five-year post-issue period. Our findings indicate that there is some temporary overvaluation of convertible issuers by the stock market, but that the resultant disappointed investors will subsequently correct their valuation errors. The similarity of our results to those reported within the prior literature on initial public offers (IPOs) and seasoned equity offers (SEOs) suggests that the earnings management hypothesis is not unique to stock offers, but that it actually extends to convertible bond offers.

40|$|This study {{provides}} evidence between auditors' fees and earnings management in New Zealand. The fee measures {{used in this}} study are audit fees, non-audit fees and total fees paid by a client to the audit firm. For each of the three fee measures, I derive client importance fee measures that reflect a client’s economic importance to the auditor relative to other clients of the auditor at the city office and national levels. This study employs both performance adjusted discretionary <b>accruals</b> and <b>current</b> <b>accruals</b> as proxies for earnings management. Using a sample of 224 firm-years comprising firms listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the results of multivariate tests indicate an adverse association between non-audit fees and earnings management. In other words, non-audit fees paid by a client relative to fees paid by other clients, at the office and national levels, appear to impair the auditor’s independence because clients generating relatively more non-audit fees report greater discretionary and <b>current</b> <b>accruals.</b> Such evidence is more pronounced for income increasing accrual proxies for earnings management. The results also show that audit fee is not related to earnings management. As the results in this study are consistent across both discretionary and <b>current</b> <b>accruals,</b> the validity of the results is strengthened. This study contributes to the literature by providing insight into how auditors’ fee metrics indicating client importance affect earnings management in a legal and institutional environment of a small economy, and where the audit market is largely saturated with little room for growth. This study raises implications for relevant regulatory bodies in New Zealand pertaining to future developments of auditor independence and financial reporting regulations...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} two chapters. Chapter One provides definitive {{evidence about the}} effect of discretionary <b>current</b> <b>accruals</b> on the pricing of IPOs. Specifically, I seek to discriminate between two alternative explanations for the prior findings: 1) behavioral biases coupled with limited arbitrage; and 2) the sample- and period-specific nature of the results in the prior literature. Using hand-gathered accrual data for all IPOs from 1926 to 1961 and machine-readable accrual data for all IPOs from 1962 to 1998, I obtain the following results. First, I fail to observe a negative association between discretionary <b>current</b> <b>accruals</b> and subsequent price performance for the 1926 to 1971 period. Second, my analysis reveals that the pattern of cross-sectional evidence is inconsistent with the predictions made by behavioral theories. Third, in the 1972 to 1998 period, evidence of predictable negative performance attributable to IPO discretionary <b>current</b> <b>accruals</b> is limited to NASDAQ firms. Overall, these findings are difficult to reconcile with mispricing as an outcome of investor behavioral biases correlated across individuals. Chapter Two examines how financial statement informativeness, analyst following, and company news relate to the information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders. Corporations' timely disclosures of value relevant information and information collection by outsiders reduce information asymmetry, limiting insiders' ability to trade profitably on private information. We use the profitability and intensity of insider trades to proxy for information asymmetry. We find that increased analyst following is associated with reduced profitability of insider trades and reduced insider purchases. Financial statement(cont.) informativeness is negatively associated with the frequency of insider purchases. However, company news, good or bad, is positively associated with insider purchase frequency. by Xu Li. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, 2004.

40|$|We {{know that}} {{managers}} may use their discretion by structuring transactions that can alter financial reports {{in order to}} persuade stockholders in their interpretation of the underlying economic performance of the company. The study reported in this thesis examines such earnings discretion in the six monthly interim reports issued by listed firms in the UK, and investigates the relationship between estimates of earnings manipulation and the market pricing of the firm’s shares. This is tested by examining whether managers use their discretion to sustain earnings trends {{in the case of}} ‘winner’ firms, i. e. those that are in the upper range of prior returns, and likewise to keep a negative trend in ‘loser’ firms, those in the lower range of prior returns. Specifically, momentum portfolios are formed based on past six-month returns and tested for differences in future six-month earnings management, as measured by discretionary <b>current</b> <b>accruals</b> in six month interim reporting periods. The results suggest that discretionary <b>current</b> <b>accruals</b> are significantly associated with past returns for winner more than loser firms, and hence that past returns may contribute to the explanation of future earnings management, the behaviour being consistent with appearing either to persist as winners or to turn losers aroun...|$|R

40|$|Cash flow {{statements}} have {{a longstanding}} history as mandated financial statement disclosures, having replaced funds flow statements. The usefulness of such disclosures {{with respect to}} one of the main purposes of financial statements—providing information relevant to the assessment of future cash flows and their uncertainty, and the market value of firms—is still subject to debate. This study investigates whether various partitions of earnings involving combinations of a cash flow measure of performance and measures of <b>current</b> <b>accruals</b> and non-current accruals improve the ability to explain market values in the UK relative to using earnings alone. Using a valuation model-based methodology, and employing a UK sample of non-financial firms for the years 1993 to 2007, our results suggest strong support for the assertion that cash flows can have incremental value relevance relative to either earnings or funds flows. By implication, cash flows can have separate value relevance from total and, in particular, <b>current</b> <b>accruals.</b> There is slightly less consistent evidence that <b>current</b> and non-current <b>accruals</b> can have separate value relevance but, nonetheless, the results are still strongly in favour in this respect. Generally, the main source of increase in explanatory power for market values is the separate inclusion of our cash flow measure in the estimated regressions. As a consequence, we conclude that the statement of cash flows in the UK provides information useful to UK investors in valuing firms. Further, requiring a cash flow statement, as opposed to a funds flow statement, improves the information content of financial statements in the UK...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} the relation between corporate governance and earnings management around UK rights issues. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the effect of board structure, ownership structure, adviser structure, and capital structure on discretionary <b>current</b> <b>accruals</b> – a proxy for earnings management – for a sample of size-controlled rights issuers. Rights issues are chosen as {{a context in which}} firms have particular incentives to manage earnings. Findings – The results suggest that firms with higher debt to equity ratios, with lower proportions of non-executive directors, or with no large block owner, are more likely to use discretionary <b>current</b> <b>accruals</b> to manipulate earnings around rights issues. Research limitations/implications – Similar research can be conducted around other equity issuing methods such as open offers and around other major corporate events such as initial public offerings. Practical implications – The paper's evidence contributes to an understanding of corporate governance and has practical implications for stakeholders. It suggests that investors can rely more on the financial disclosures of firms with lower debt to equity ratios, higher proportions of outside directors, and with a large blockholder. Regulators may propose that firms undertaking corporate events such as equity offerings should follow best corporate governance practices to enhance investor confidence.

We find evidence that, as non-audit fees increase, audit quality (measured by performance-adjusted discretionary <b>current</b> <b>accruals</b> and earnings-response coefficients) reduces only for clients with low institutional ownership but not for clients with high institutional ownership. Our results are robust after controlling for auditor industry specialization, firms’ operating volatility, size effect, and potential endogeneity between institutional ownership and audit quality...|$|R
