25|$|While the {{epigenetic}} mechanisms behind {{dosage compensation}} in birds are poorly understood, especially {{in comparison to}} the well-studied mechanisms of dosage compensation in humans and Drosophila, several recent studies have revealed promising sequences. One example is MHM (male hypermethylated) RNA, an Xist-like long noncoding RNA that is expressed only in female chickens (ZW). It is associated with female-specific hyper-acetylation of lysine 16 on histone 4 near the MHM locus on the Z chromosome. This MHM locus is heavily studied as a site of dosage compensation because male Z chromosomes are hypermethylated and thus underexpress genes in this area in comparison to female Z chromosomes which are hyperacetylated and overexpress these genes. There has been debate on whether the MHM locus constitutes dosage compensation, however, since scientists claim that even if the MHM locus has been found to have significantly greater expression in females than in males, it could not even be considered to be a dosage <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanism</b> since it does not balance gene dose between the Z chromosome and autosomes in the heterogametic sex.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in {{the first}} SOD enzyme (SOD1) can cause {{familial}} amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, a form of motor neuron disease). The most common mutation in the U.S. is A4V, while the most intensely studied is G93A. The other two isoforms of SOD have not been linked to any human diseases, however, in mice inactivation of SOD2 causes perinatal lethality and inactivation of SOD1 causes hepatocellular carcinoma. Mutations in SOD1 can cause familial ALS (several pieces of evidence also show that wild-type SOD1, under conditions of cellular stress, is implicated in a significant fraction of sporadic ALS cases, which represent 90% of ALS patients.), by a mechanism that is presently not understood, but not due to loss of enzymatic activity or {{a decrease in the}} conformational stability of the SOD1 protein. Overexpression of SOD1 has been linked to the neural disorders seen in Down syndrome. In patients with thalassemia, SOD will increase as a form of <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> However, in the chronic stage, SOD {{does not seem to be}} insufficient and tends to decrease due to the destruction of proteins from the massive reaction of oxidant-antioxidant.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveProductivity {{costs are}} usually {{estimated}} by multiplying the wage with the period absent. This {{can lead to}} an overestimation if <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> occur. Until now only Dutch data {{are available on the}} influence of <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on lost productivity, but between-country differences in frequency and type of <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can be expected. The objective {{of this study was to}} understand whether <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for days absent from paid work differ in type and frequency across countries and to explore whether this would result in between-country differences in relevant lost productivity. MethodsData from a cross-sectional survey among respondents with rheumatic disorders from four countries were the basis for this study. Analyses focused on respondents with paid employment who reported absence in the last 3 months. The different <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are described and the resulting lost productivity in terms of days absent was calculated with and without taking <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> into account. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine which variables influence <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> leading to relevant lost productivity. ResultsThe results indicate that <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> occur and are relevant in all four countries. Between-country differences in the type and frequency of <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and relevant lost productivity were observed. The logistic regression analyses indicate that, correcting for other variables, this is also the case for the use of <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> leading to relevant lost productivity. ConclusionsBetween-country differences in <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in case of absenteeism exist and could vary to such an extent that foreign relevant lost productivity data should be used with caution...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses insights of law and economics to predict the effects of <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on the incentives of depositors, financial institutions, financial regulators and government. Findings – The paper shows that the current compensation system in The Netherlands will not provide sufficient incentives for all stakeholders to prevent the failure of a financial institution. Adjustments to this system are necessary to improve these incentives. Original/value – The paper examines for the first time the impact of different <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on the incentives of multiple stakeholders. It also shows how these mechanisms influence each other regarding their incentive generating capability. These findings offer important insights for policy makers.

To do so, we must help Israel identify and strengthen those partners who are truly committed to peace, while isolating those who seek conflict and instability, and stand with Israel against those who seek its destruction. The United States and its Quartet partners should continue to isolate Hamas until it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel's right to exist, and abides by past agreements.

We have provided a comparative legal analysis of the financial <b>compensation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> following floods, be it through insurance, public funds, or a combination of both, with an empirical focus on Belgium, the Netherlands, England, and France.

There is great potential within the recovery strategy for promoting preventive action, for example in terms of discouraging citizens from living in high-risk areas, or encouraging the uptake of mitigation measures, such as adaptive building. However, this large potential has yet to be realized, in part because of insufficient consideration and promotion of these connections within existing legal frameworks. We have made recommendations about how the linkages between strategies can be further improved. These recommendations relate to, among others, the promotion of resilient reinstatement through recovery mechanisms and the removal of legal barriers preventing the establishment of link-inducing measures. status: publishe...|$|R
