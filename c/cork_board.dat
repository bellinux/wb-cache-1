2500|$|The {{first public}} dial-up BBS was {{developed}} by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess. According to an early interview, when Chicago was snowed under during the Great Blizzard of 1978, the two began preliminary work on the Computerized Bulletin Board System, or CBBS. The system came into existence largely through a fortuitous combination of Christensen having a spare S-100 bus computer and an early Hayes internal modem, and Suess's insistence that the machine be placed at his house in Chicago {{where it would be}} a local phone call to millions of users. Christensen patterned the system after the <b>cork</b> <b>board</b> his local computer club used to post information like [...] "need a ride". CBBS officially went online on 16 February 1978. CBBS, which kept a count of callers, reportedly connected 253,301 callers before it was finally retired.|$|E

50|$|Cork withdrew in 1944 over a {{separate}} issue, {{the debate over}} a females-only administration for camogie. Their eight-year withdrawal from the championship has been characterised by the game’s official historian as the act of an individual, Cork chairman Idé Bean Uí Shé. Mary Moran wrote in her 2011 history of camogie, A Game of Our Own:Readers must wonder how an individual could withdraw Cork from the Association {{and get away with}} it. I have put that question to camogie people of the time. The usual reply was ‘we were unable to challenge her’. Idé Bean Uí Shé lectured in Irish at U.C.C. whereas many of the delegates that attended the Cork County Board had left school in their early teens. If someone disputed the point with her, she immediately switched to speaking Irish, leaving the delegate at a disadvantage. On the other hand, some delegates were happy to let Idé lead the way and they followed without question. The situation dragged on for years. Eventually, Old Aloysians {{came up with the idea}} of making her Life President of the <b>Cork</b> <b>Board.</b> She was delighted with the honour.

The game was originally fixed for Kilbrittain but Ballinadee agreed to go to Bandon. However, when they saw the heavy state of the Bandon pitch they at first refused to play and the game was held up for an hour.
