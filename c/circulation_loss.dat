Even with the best drilling practices <b>circulation</b> <b>losses</b> do occur. In order to reduce such losses to acceptable level fluid Loss Control Material (LCM) is used. In this work, three natural water-insoluble cellulosic materials; peanut hulls, bagasse and sawdust were investigated as lost circulation control materials. One hundred and eight different LCM samples made of various materials were tested with mud. The experiments were conducted in a permeability plugging apparatus (PPA) at a differential pressure of 100  psi and 300  psi, using 10, 60 and 90 ceramic discs. The performance of each LCM sample was determined based on the amount of spurt loss and total fluid loss of the mud according to the American Petroleum Institute (API) standard. The obtained results showed that, the amount of the fluid loss depends on the LCM material, concentration and size distribution, testing results show that, the peanut gives the best results among the bagasse and sawdust, especially fine size which exhibited better results in the filtration characteristics due to the better filling properties of this size.

40|$|The Iceland Deep Drilling Project {{research}} well RN- 15 /IDDP- 2 at Reykjanes, Iceland, {{reached its}} target of supercritical conditions {{at a depth}} of 4. 5  km in January 2017. After only 6 days of heating, the measured bottom hole temperature was 426  °C, and the fluid pressure was 34  MPa. The southern tip of the Reykjanes peninsula is the landward extension of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in Iceland. Reykjanes is unique among Icelandic geothermal systems in that it is recharged by seawater, which has a critical point of 406  °C at 29. 8  MPa. The geologic setting and fluid characteristics at Reykjanes provide a geochemical analog that allows us to investigate the roots of a mid-ocean ridge submarine black smoker hydrothermal system. Drilling began with deepening an existing 2. 5  km deep vertical production well (RN- 15) to 3  km depth, followed by inclined drilling directed towards the main upflow zone of the system, for a total slant depth of 4659  m ([*]∼[*]  4. 5  km vertical depth). Total <b>circulation</b> <b>losses</b> of drilling fluid were encountered below 2. 5  km, which could not be cured using lost circulation blocking materials or multiple cement jobs.

Rocks in the cores are basalts and dolerites with alteration ranging from upper greenschist facies to amphibolite facies, suggesting that formation temperatures at depth exceed 450  °C. High-permeability circulation-fluid loss zones (feed points or feed zones) were detected at multiple depth levels below 3  km depth to bottom.

This well was intended as an exploration well to investigate potential reservoir formations underlying the productive horizons. Nearly the entire well was drilled with complete <b>circulation</b> <b>loss</b> in very hard and inhomogeneous rock. Due to elevated temperatures and corrosive conditions, severe drilling problems such as tool deviation, drill pipe corrosion, breakage, fishing, and side tracking arose below 3000  m.

The effect of drilling fluid and cutting density on the pressure drop, deposit ratio and string stress on the cutting transport has been investigated. A systematic validation study is presented by comparing the simulation results against published experimental database. The results showed that by increasing two times of drilling fluid density/operational density, cutting precipitation ratio decreased 32.9 % and stress applied on the drilling string and pressure drop increased 4.59 and 5.97 %, respectively. By increasing two times of drilling cutting density/operational density, cutting precipitation ratio increased 200 %. Also, there is an optimum point for drilling cutting density at 8.5 in which stress applied on the drilling string will be minimum.|$|E

30|$|Pilehvari and Nyshadham (2002) have {{discussed}} that <b>circulation</b> <b>losses</b> {{can be classified}} into three distinct groups as seepage loss, when the loss rate is 1 – 10  bbl/h, partial loss, when the loss rate is 10 – 500  bbl/h, and complete loss, when the loss rate is more than 500  bbl/h. On the other hand, losses can be divided to minor and severe losses. Minor loss occurs when total loss is between 6 and 470 barrels or it takes less than 48  h to be treated by either increasing mud viscosity or increasing small amount of LCMs to the mud. Severe losses are experienced where losses are > 470 barrels or it takes > 48  h to control or cease the lost circulation by adding some bridging materials to the circulation system (Moazzeni and Nabaei 2010).|$|R

In the shallower boiling zone of the field, some points of rapid temperature rise were found in cased sections of bores.

40|$|Investigation of surge {{pressure}} {{is of great}} significance to the <b>circulation</b> <b>loss</b> problem caused by unsteady operations in management pressure drilling (MPD) operations. With full consideration of the important factors such as wave velocity, gas influx rate, pressure, temperature, and well depth, a new {{surge pressure}} model has been proposed based on the mass conservation equations and the momentum conservation equations during MPD operations. The finite-difference method, the Newton-Raphson iterative method, and the fourth-order explicit Runge-Kutta method (R-K 4) are adopted to solve the model. Calculation {{results indicate that the}} surge pressure has different values with respect to different drill pipe tripping speeds and well parameters. In general, the surge pressure tends to increase with the increases of drill pipe operating speed and with the decrease of gas influx rate and wellbore diameter. When the gas influx occurs, the surge pressure is weakened obviously. The surge pressure can cause a significant lag time if the gas influx occurs at bottomhole, and it is mainly affected by pressure wave velocity. The maximum surge pressure may occur before drill pipe reaches bottomhole, and the surge pressure is mainly affected by drill pipe operating speed and gas influx rate...|$|E
30|$|Additionally to the {{uncertain}} behavior of drilling fluid under extremely high temperatures, {{one of the}} main problems during drilling exploration wells is uncertainties related to pore and fracture pressures and potential over-pressurized zones. This problem was resolved in the Venelle- 2 campaign by Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) system with a rotating circulation device (RDC) and Coriolis’s flow meter, which is mostly used in depleted oil and gas reservoirs with severe circulation losses (Bertani et al. 2018). MPD systems allow maintaining well pressures slightly higher than the pore pressure, which might be a potential solution for maintaining constant downhole pressures in high-enthalpy geothermal boreholes, preventing differential sticking and allowing for much safer and more efficient drilling in severe <b>circulation</b> <b>loss</b> zones. Unfortunately, MPD systems cannot guarantee well control but rather, enable to provide constant monitoring of bottom hole pressures and flow rates. This helps to evaluate in a real-time variation of downhole conditions and keep the downhole pressure balance within a certain range. Installed Coriolis flow meter is able to detect any difference between flow in and out, whereas through RCD choke valves are controlled and surface back pressure is being regulated.|$|E
30|$|The San Pompeo 2 {{exploration}} well was drilled in 1979 {{to identify the}} deep production zones down to the 3000  m reflector. The operations were carried out with a total loss of circulation starting from a depth of 836  m {{to the bottom of}} the well. Any attempt of plugging the rock formation fractures to stop <b>circulation</b> <b>loss</b> during drilling proved to be unsuccessful. Several drill string failures occurred while drilling, mainly due to corrosion from hydrogen expelled from the reservoir. During drilling at a depth of 2930  m, a violent hydrogen gas explosion was experienced. After the blow-out, well collapsed and only the first 2560  m of the well depth was accessible for further testing due to rock debris left at the well bottom. The San Pompeo 2 well experienced another similar blow-out incident right after drilling operations restarted. Samples from deep geothermal fluids proved the presence of hostile gases and strongly corrosive environment (Barbier 1984). Temperature and pressure conditions proved the presence of a superheated geothermal resource, i.e., 394  °C and 212 bars at 2560  m of depth.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} of buildings {{has become a}} significant issue in Latvia and across Europe. More than a half (by heated area) of Latvian housing stock consists of multi-family buildings. 63 % of buildings are panel houses built during the Soviet era when no one thought about energy efficiency issue and energy resources was very cheap. Today, energy prices are increasing, the EU sets targets to increase energy efficiency, reduce of GHG emissions and promote the use of renewables. Building renovation is a sustainable approach for Latvia to achieve these objectives because the housing sector is a huge consumer of energy – 40 % of total energy consumption. A great way to promote such renovations is to use Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) concept. EPC is a legal contract between the beneficiary and the provider (an ESCO) of an energy efficiency improvement measure, verified and monitored during the whole term of the contract, where investments (works, supplies or services) in that measure are paid for {{in relation to a}} contractually agreed level of energy efficiency improvement. In Latvia, EPC+ contracting has been recently applied to the comprehensive renovation of multi-family residential buildings. A study is being carried out on 12 projects, which have been implemented over the last 5 years. Measurements and calculations have been carried out. Based on 2013 data, on average space heating consumption of fully completed buildings is down to 77 kWh/(m 2 a) and network <b>circulation</b> <b>losses</b> is down to 4. 5 kWh/(m 2 a), meaning a combined figure of 81. 5 kWh/(m 2 a).

30|$|Several {{drilling}} issues arose. As {{is common}} in geothermal wells, especially in highly fractured reservoirs, wells were drilled with total <b>circulation</b> <b>loss,</b> and sometimes a very low rate of penetration (ROP) and high bit wear. In addition, problems arose due to additives to the drilling fluid. The fluid sometimes coagulated, blocking the drill string and eventually leading to stuck pipe. Due to the high temperatures and acidic reservoir fluids, drill string fatigue and corrosion was observed, sometimes leading to breakage [(Gunnlaugsson et al. 2014; Miller 1980; Sanada et al. 1998) and references given in “Initial experience with supercritical systems” section]. Consequently fishing, and eventually side tracking, was performed. Often, cementing a casing across high permeability fractures is necessary. The high-temperature environment also affects cement setting kinetics {{and can lead to}} cement-job failures. To be able to economically access and to sustainably utilize supercritical geothermal systems, improved drilling, completion, and cementing practices have to be implemented. Completion components {{have to be able to}} handle high temperatures and pressures and acidic environments. Monitoring of subsurface conditions by measurements while drilling (MWD) can help to predict critical zones and conditions. Scaling and erosion processes have to be considered. Once a well is completed, logging and monitoring instruments have to be capable of operating at ambient downhole conditions.|$|E
30|$|Defining {{failure modes}} for studied wells {{proved to be}} difficult, {{due to the lack}} of {{detailed}} data, published well reports and literature available and authors had to base their knowledge on a small and limited amount of published data. From the 20 drilling projects presented in Table  1, drilled in or close to supercritical conditions, failure modes are known only for a few wells. In most cases, failure of the geothermal well was caused by excessively high thermally induced stresses exerted upon the casing string and couplings during operations such as well quenching or production kick-off causing casing collapse and/or connections rupture. Casing collapse in some cases might have been also propagated by bad cementing job commonly executed in zones of partial or total <b>circulation</b> <b>loss.</b> In few wells, blow-out or near-blow-out conditions were encountered, which in most cases precluded further drilling due to safety concerns. In older wells, not aimed to penetrate the supercritical resource, such as KJ- 39, NJ- 11, KS- 13 or San Vito- 1, the well design was not rated for such extreme temperature and pressure conditions and well completion was finalized at much shallower depths. Some of the mentioned wells, after reconstruction work, serve today as injection wells. In other wells, investigation of deeper supercritical resources had to be halted due to safety reasons of ejection of hostile gases, such as H 2 S, which might have promoted damages to the mechanical infrastructure as well as cause health and life danger. The heavy precipitation, corrosion, and erosion due to high flow rates of hostile and oftentimes hypersaline geothermal brines are also noted as serious issues, especially during fluid production and well testing.|$|E
30|$|No {{sufficient}} data were found regarding well failures in geothermal wells of the Menegai geothermal field. The main challenges experienced during drilling of high-temperature wells {{in that area}} were incidents of stuck pipe between well depths of 2100  m and 2200  m, where magma was encountered. Drilling of the MW- 01 well was performed with partial and total circulation losses. The drill string got stuck {{at the end of}} drilling at 2206  m (Makuk 2013; Mbia 2014). During drilling the MW- 03 well, the similar situation occurred at depths of 1187 and 2112  m. The well MW- 04 yielded cuttings of freshly quenched volcanic glass at a depth of 2080  m. Drilling close to this magma resulted in problems such as stuck pipe at 2117  m and the drill bit damages, due to extremely high temperatures. After unsuccessful fishing operations, around 20  m of bottom hole assembly, composed of a drill bit, sub, stabilizer, and two drill collars was abandoned inside the well. The completion was carried out with a slotted liner above the ‘fish’. At final depth, rather low permeability values were encountered. Only intermittent and partial losses were experienced at the deepest well sections and no serious <b>circulation</b> <b>loss</b> problems were encountered (Mbia 2014). The MW- 06 well (also called MW- 05) yielded freshly quenched volcanic glassy cuttings at a depth of 2172  m. Drilling in the close vicinity to magma resulted in challenges such as stuck pipe at 2203  m. Similarly, as in MW- 04, the bottom hole assembly with the length of 21  m, composed of a drill bit, sub and two drill collars was left in the wellbore and the borehole was completed with a slotted liner above the ‘fish’ (Makuk 2013; Mibei 2012).|$|E

This study involves analysis of temperature, pressure, enthalpy and permeability in wells and their distribution along the area. The wells located in the central {{western side of the}} geothermal field are productive, whereas those located at the central-eastern side are non-productive. Through temperature profiles, determined at steady state in the analyzed wells, it was observed that at bottom conditions (approximately 2300  m depth), temperatures vary between 280 and 360  °C. The temperatures are higher at the eastern side of central zone of LHGF. A review of transient pressure tests, laboratory measurements of core samples, and correlation of <b>circulation</b> <b>losses</b> during drilling suggest that permeability of the formation is low.

Based on energy exchange mechanisms of wellbore and formation systems during circulation and shut-in stages under lost circulation conditions, a set of partial differential equations were developed to account for the transient heat exchange process between wellbore and formation. A finite difference method was used to solve the transient heat transfer models, which enables the wellbore and formation temperature profiles to be accurately predicted. Moreover, heat exchange generated by heat convection due to <b>circulation</b> <b>losses</b> to the rock surrounding a well was also considered in the mathematical model. The results indicated that the lost circulation zone and the casing programme had significant effects on the temperature distributions of wellbore and formation.
