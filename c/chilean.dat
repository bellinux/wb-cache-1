5|$|In 1891, after {{a series}} of struggles about {{multinational}} nitrate interests, <b>Chilean</b> President José Manuel Balmaceda refused to sign the national budget passed by the <b>Chilean</b> National Congress. Balmaceda then dissolved Congress. The dissolution split both the <b>Chilean</b> Army and Navy, with some forces remaining loyal to Congress and others to the President. An armed conflict ensued after a mutiny by the navy, which at that time was docked at Valparaíso.|$|E
5|$|Although the Argentine and <b>Chilean</b> navies possessed {{insignificant}} {{naval forces}} in the 1860s, with zero and five warships, respectively, Argentina's concern over a strong Brazilian Navy and the <b>Chilean</b> war against Spain caused them to add capable warships to their fleets in the 1870s. During this time, diplomatic relations between Argentina and Chile soured due to conflicting boundary claims, particularly in Patagonia. By {{the beginning of the}} 1880s, after the War of the Pacific, the <b>Chilean</b> government possessed possibly the strongest navy in the Americas. They planned to add to it with an 1887 appropriation for one battleship, two protected cruisers, and two torpedo gunboats. Argentina responded a year later with an order for two battleships of its own. The naval arms race unfolded over the next several years, with each country buying and ordering vessels that were slightly better than the previous ship, but the Argentines eventually pulled ahead with the acquisition of multiple Garibaldi-class cruisers.|$|E

In June 1973, the Liberian oil tanker Napier ran aground on Guamblin Island, accidentally releasing 30,000 tons of oil. After the rescue of the crew, the vessel was fired upon and set on fire by <b>Chilean</b> Hunters {{in an effort to}} burn the oil to avoid further environmental contamination.|$|E

50|$|Koreans in Chile are {{respected}} by <b>Chileans</b> of other backgrounds {{for their work}} ethic, but are perceived as a very closed community, especially with regards to interracial marriage. The Korean shops of Patronato are well known for their low prices and diverse products but some <b>Chileans</b> and competitors feel some envy towards the commercial success of Koreans in their country. At the same time, however, <b>Chileans</b> have respect for the rapid economic development undertaken by South Korea. On the other hand, Koreans in Chile often perceive <b>Chileans</b> as superficial in their friendships, lazy, irresponsible, and somewhat racist.|$|R
50|$|Emigration of <b>Chileans</b> has {{decreased}} {{during the last}} decade: It is estimated that 857,781 <b>Chileans</b> live abroad, 50.1% of those being in Argentina (the highest number), 13.3% in Brazil and 8.8% in the United States.|$|R

Many other Chicago School alumni were appointed government posts {{during and after the}} Pinochet years; others taught its economic doctrine at <b>Chilean</b> universities.

5|$|The <b>Chilean</b> Civil War (1891), {{rather than}} calming the naval ambitions of Chile, {{escalated}} them. In that conflict, the <b>Chilean</b> Navy {{played a significant}} role on the congressional side against the president and the army. The resulting victory of the congressional side and subsequent presidency of Admiral Jorge Montt led to a large increase in prestige and consequent funding for the navy. Argentine naval units assisted failed revolts in Argentina, but the continuing acrimony with and naval acquisitions of Chile meant this had little effect.|$|E

An Argentine warship did the same to a Chilean-licensed American ship in 1877. This action nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines dispatched a squadron of warships to the Santa Cruz River. The <b>Chilean</b> Navy responded in kind, and war was only avoided by a hastily signed treaty.|$|E

5|$|To {{the west}} of the <b>Chilean</b> Andes are an early group of eruptions, dated from the Oligocene and the Early Miocene (33.3–20.2mya). The scale of the eruptive events that {{produced}} these features remains unclear. Further east, in the actual range, are huge numbers of eruptions. Between 15.3 and 6.4mya, widespread volcanism took place, followed by extensive folding; this process then repeated itself from 18.4 to 13.7 mya during the Miocene. Beginning 6.4 mya the <b>Chilean</b> Andes were quiet, though whether or not this quiet period took place throughout all of the Andes remains unknown. Central <b>Chilean</b> volcanoes became active once again around 2.5mya, and have erupted almost continuously since.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, ampelographers began to {{distinguish}} Sauvignon blanc from Sauvignonasse plantings in Chile. The character of non-blended <b>Chilean</b> Sauvignon blanc are noticeably less acidic than the wines of New Zealand and {{more similar to}} the French style that is typical of <b>Chilean</b> wines. The region of Valparaíso is the most notable area for Sauvignon blanc in Chile due to its cooler climate which allows the grapes {{to be picked up}} to six weeks later than in other parts of Chile. In Brazil, ampelographers have discovered that the vines called Sauvignon blanc planted in the region are really Seyval blanc.|$|E
