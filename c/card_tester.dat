40|$|This project {{consists}} {{in the design}} and implementation of an electronic <b>card</b> <b>tester,</b> in order to detect any failure in its basic components. This system performs an element by element check between two cards, the characteristic curve of any element is plotted on a graphic LCD (GLCD) and thus the defective item can be detected. A PIC 18 F 4520 programmed in PIC C is used for the interaction between the programmed digital and analog electronics; this interaction is done {{with the help of an}} analog-to-digital converter module within the microcontroller. It uses a touch screen panel, which allows the user to select the channel that they want to observe by pressing on the graphic LCD...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the highly productive process technologies of microprobe arrays, which {{were used for}} a probecard to test a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chip with fine pitch pads. Cantilever-type microprobearrays were fabricated using conventional micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) process technologies. Bondingmaterial, gold-tin (Au-Sn) paste, was used to bond the Ni-Co alloy microprobes to the ceramic space transformer. The electrical and mechanical characteristics of a probe card with fabricated microprobes were measured by aconventional probe <b>card</b> <b>tester.</b> A probe card assembled with the fabricated microprobes showed good x-y alignmentand planarity errors within ± 5 μm and ± 10 μm, respectively. In addition, the average leakage current and contactresistance were approximately 1. 04 nA and 0. 054 ohm, respectively. The proposed highly productive microprobes canbe applied to a MEMS probe card, to test a DRAM chip with fine pitch pads...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma(Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1989 {{various types}} of {{electronic}} card test equipment are freely available today for different types of electronic printed circuit boards. A company certainly wants to pick the most suitable tester to suit their needs, and more importantly a tester that will fit into their bUdget. Today a company can easily import in-circuit testers that will cost well in the reglon of six figures. The cheaper the equipment go, the less features one can expect from the equipment. Like all other big decisions in life, this might also be a tough one for a company. Part one of this thesis will consider most of these questions, and will also give more insight on what type of specifications to look for. This section will also explain {{the different types of}} faults that occur, the repair costs involved, different types of card testers available and some of their features. Advanced in-circuit testing techniques will also be explained. Part two of this thesis describes the design and development of the Identif ier <b>Card</b> <b>Tester.</b> The" Program Control and Impulse Sender Card", (referred to as "Identifier Card") is one of the cards used in a system called "Electronic Identifier". The electronic identifier was developed to enable a subscriber directory number, a line or equipment numbers, or in general, the origin of information and classes-of-service to be determined by way of an existing connection within a telephone exchange. The system was designed for the purpose of incorporating it into the existing public exchanges where no identifier wires are available. It operates on the principle of a switching circuit (line) tester. The identification pulses are evaluated with the aid of 6 mm bistable magnetic ring cores according to the current steering principle. The program control and the output circuit uses a transistor, a magnetic core/transistor or a magnetic core/thyristor circuit. The electronic identifier is mostly used with "Routiners" in Electra-mechanical exchanges. The biggest percentage of failures on these systems are caused by the Identifier Card and hence the request {{for the development of a}} "Identifier Card Tester"...|$|E
40|$|The multiplexer-demultiplexer (MDM) project {{included}} the design, documentation, manufacture, {{and testing of}} three MDM Data Systems. The equipment is contained in 59 racks, and includes more than 3, 000 circuit boards and 600 microprocessors. Spares, circuit <b>card</b> <b>testers,</b> a master set of programmable integrated circuits, and a program development system were included as deliverables. All three MDM's were installed, and were operationally tested. The systems performed well with no major problems. The progress and problems analysis, addresses schedule conformance, new technology, items awaiting government approval, and project conclusions are summarized.

50|$|Mid-range memory testers {{typically}} priced under $26,000, and {{are commonly}} found in memory module manufacturing assembly houses. These testers are built to support mass volumes of memory module testing. They are also used for detecting assembly faults caused by mis-soldering and cross-cell contamination after chips are assembled onto PCB or SIMM <b>cards.</b> These memory <b>testers</b> are usually docked onto an automatic handling system for high volume production testing, thus eliminating manual intervention by an operator.|$|R
50|$|The two Death Match {{candidates}} {{and four other}} players played a game similar to the card game Dixit. All six players were dealt six cards with pictures on their fronts. The two candidates would take turns {{playing the role of}} Tester. In each round, the Tester would play a card face down and give a brief but misleading description of the card. The other five players would then play a card of their own that followed the same description. The six cards were then shuffled and revealed face up, and all but the Tester would guess which of the cards belonged to the Tester. If the Tester's opponent chooses the right <b>card,</b> the <b>Tester</b> loses 1 garnet; if the Tester's opponent guesses wrong, that candidate loses a garnet. However, if all five players guess correctly or they all guess wrong, the Tester loses 2 garnets. The first candidate to lose all their garnets is eliminated.|$|R
40|$|Episodic-like {{memory for}} the 2 ̆ 2 where 2 ̆ 2 {{component}} of unique events was examined {{in an adult}} gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). The gorilla witnessed a unique event, performed by an experimenter (e. g. watching an experimenter blow bubbles) at one of three locations surrounding his enclosure. After a 4 to 17 minute retention interval, a tester presented the gorilla with photographs of the three locations, which were mounted on wooden cards, and asked the gorilla where the event had occurred. The gorilla communicated his choice by handing a <b>card</b> to the <b>tester</b> and was rewarded if correct. The gorilla was significantly above chance at identifying the event location. Results suggest that the gorilla was not responding {{on the basis of}} familiarity by choosing the most recently visited location, but choosing the location where the event occurred...|$|R
50|$|Probe card {{efficiency}} {{is affected by}} many factors. Perhaps {{the most important factor}} impacting probe card {{efficiency is}} the number of DUTs that can be tested in parallel. Many wafers today are still tested one device at a time. If one wafer had 1000 of these devices and the time required to test one device was 10 seconds and the time for the prober to move from one device to another device was 1 second, then to test an entire wafer would take 1000 x 11 seconds = 11,000 seconds or roughly 3 hours. If however, the probe <b>card</b> and the <b>tester</b> could test 16 devices in parallel (with 16 times the electrical connections) than the test time would be reduced by almost exactly 16 times. Note that because now the probe card has 16 devices, as the prober touches down on the round wafer, it may not always contact an active device and will therefore be a little less than 16 times as fast to test one wafer.|$|R
40|$|A 9 U 400 mm VME FED <b>Tester</b> <b>card</b> (FT) {{has been}} {{designed}} for evaluation and production testing of the CMS silicon microstrip tracker Front End Driver (FED). The FT {{is designed to simulate}} both the tracker analogue optical signals and the trigger digital signals required by a FED. Each FT can drive up to 24 FED optical input channels. The internal logic of the FT is based on large FPGAs which employ fast digital logic, digital clock managers and memories. Test patterns and real tracker data can be loaded via VME to the memories. DACs operating at 40 MHz convert the data to analogue form and drive the on-board CMS tracker Analogue-Opto-Hybrids (AOH) to convert the data to analogue optical format. Hence, they are identical to the signals produced by the CMS tracker. The FT either transmits the clock and trigger information directly to a FED or to the CMS Trigger and Timing Control (TTC) system. Four such cards will be used to fully test a FED. One FT prototype has been manufactured and is currently being used to evaluate the CMS tracker FED. This paper describes the FED Tester design and architecture. I...|$|R
5000|$|The NESS is {{affiliated}} with the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) and has on occasion acted as a preliminary tester for the Million Dollar Challenge. One such test was {{of a man who}} said [...] "he could mentally control the outcome of random coin flips" [...] once discussions became closer to a test date his claim changed to being only able to [...] "influence" [...] the coin flips. He also stated that he needed to warm up with an undetermined amount of coin flips and at an undetermined time the powers might leave him. This meant that he wanted to flip coins, and then evaluate the results looking for the statistical anomalies that naturally exist in random events. When NESS explained that the testing needed tighter controls he decided to abandon coin flipping and switch to psychically influencing a computer's random number generator. Another JREF preliminary test NESS was involved with was a man who claimed {{to be able to read}} minds. This changed from being able to see anything in another person's mind, to using playing cards to using phrases written on a card. Phrases were written on a <b>card</b> and the <b>testers</b> friend concentrated on the phrase. The results showed that the [...] "mind-reader" [...] did not understand the protocol, regardless that he had helped to write the protocol and agreed to it in advance. Specific phrases were agreed to, with exact words from that phrase were needed for a hit. The applicant instead of [...] "common phrases gave [...] "random thoughts". According to Steven Novella, [...] "paranormal claims... represent an opportunity for the skeptical community to teach the public about the proper methods of science, the pitfalls of illogic and self-deception, and the reality of fraud for self-promotion." ...|$|R
40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is {{a general}} purpose {{detector}} that will operate at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator designed {{for the study of}} new physics at the TeV energy scale. A key component of CMS is the Silicon Tracker, which has ~ 9. 3 million detector channels and is expected to generate over 70 % of the total CMS data volume. The Tracker readout system must process data at a rate that is orders of magnitude higher than in any previous particle physics experiment. On-detector readout is performed by the APV 25 front end chip. To ensure a Tracker of the highest quality and efficiency, each APV 25 must be rigorously verified; a wafer probing test station has been developed for post production quality assurance. The APV 25 contains internal pipelines which buffer event data pending readout. An APV Emulator has been designed to prevent APV 25 buffer overflow due to random fluctuations in the Level 1 trigger rate. The first stage of the off-detector readout is performed by the Front End Driver (FED). This interfaces the Tracker to the CMS Data Acquisition system and reduces the enormous volume of data output from the detector to a manageable level through the process of Zero Suppression, which involves identifying strips that contain hit information and discarding the remainder. The FED is an important, highly complex device and it is vital for every board to function correctly. An Acceptance Test has been developed to check the functionality of each FED before it leaves the assembly plant. A FED <b>Tester</b> <b>card</b> has also been produced to enable testing of the FED under realistic CMS conditions. The data integrity of the S-Link connection used to read out the FED has been assessed and an extensive suite of software has been written to verify the performance of the FED hardware and firmware. Finally, an alternative algorithm for Common Mode (CM) subtraction has been implemented in the FED firmware, with support for high occupancy events and non-uniform CM. In addition, a novel algorithm for baseline correction in APV frames has been developed...|$|R
