Different 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator systems and synthesis modules are described separately. We describe a new full automated and standardized production of 68 Ga-DOTATOC. Methods: The module has to fit with components like the pre-conditioned C 18 purifications cartridge and the DOTATOC precursor solute in HEPES buffer. The generator was fractionally eluted in time steps of 30 sec. An elution profile was created {{and the time}} frame of the middle fraction was adjusted with the basis software and the flow rate of the peristaltic pump. The reaction vial was charged with 30 &micro;g DOTATOC solved in 100 &micro;l HEPES buffer (150 - 200 mg / 0. 1 ml) {{and placed in the}} heating block. The generator was eluted with 0. 6 N HCl and the reaction volume (~ 1 ml) was collected at the reaction vial after switching the valves V 2 and V 3 for 40 s. The labeling was performed under 95 &deg;C for 12 min at pH 3. 5 - 4. Purification was achieved by injecting the reaction mixture onto the C 18 <b>cardridge,</b> washing with 1, 5 ml H 2 O and 10 ml air. The 68 Ga-DOTATOC was transferred over a sterile filter to the product vial by elution with 1 ml ethanol and 9 ml of saline. Results: The tin dioxide generator we used was specified with an elution yield in 5 ml not less than 80 %. The rule of thumb prognosticates a durability of 200 elutions or 10 month. After ~ 70 elution the yield of our systems fall below the value of 80 %. The typical overall elution, labeling and purification procedure took less than 25 min. The non-ionic buffer HEPES was most effective and the optimal amount was ~ 160 mg. Using 33 &micro;g (23 nmol),the labeling yield was 60 %- 65 % and their radiochemical purity was &gt; 97 %. Conclusion: The combination of a 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator, produced under cGMP guidelines and a "Ready for use" automated module allows a standardized production with high radiochemical yields for 68 Ga-DOTATOC. This combination of both will provide the user with facile and reliable package for the preparation in routine clinical applications, especially und the aspect of cGLP and cGM...|$|E
