5|$|NY35 {{was split}} up into two routes {{in the early}} 1940s. The portion of old NY35 west of Ontario Center Road became NY383 while the Ontario Center Road section became part of an {{extended}} NY350. The extension created an overlap between NY350 and NY33B from <b>Cator</b> Corners to NY33. NY33 was truncated on its east end to downtown Rochester on January1, 1949. As a result, NY33B was redesignated as NY31F. The easternmost leg of the route still overlapped NY350; however, it now followed NY350 south to NY31 in Macedon. NY350 was extended a short distance northward in the mid-1940s to meet the new super two highway carrying US104 between Union Hill and Sodus.|$|E
5|$|Allingham met Dorothy <b>Cator</b> (1895–1970) in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk in 1918. They {{married the}} same year in Romford, when she was 22. They moved to Eastbourne, Sussex in 1960 and {{remained}} married until she died there from acute and chronic lymphatic leukaemia. They had two daughters, Betty (born 1920) and Jean (1923–2001). Jean emigrated to the United States and died aged 78 in 2001. At {{the time of his}} death Allingham believed that Betty had died. He had lost touch with her in the 1970s following a family rift after the death of his wife in 1970. In fact Betty Hankin was still alive aged 89 when her father died, and living in Stroud, Gloucestershire. In addition to his one remaining daughter Betty, at {{the time of his death}} Allingham had seven grandchildren, 16 great-grandchildren, 14 great-great-grandchildren, and one great-great-great-grandchild.|$|E
5|$|For Haiti, the 2008 Beijing Olympics marked its fourteenth {{appearance}} at any Olympic games and its seventh consecutive appearance since the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Between that and its debut at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, Haitian teams competed at the Olympics {{that took place}} during 1924 (Paris), 1928 (Amsterdam), 1932 (Los Angeles), 1960 (Rome), 1972 (Munich, West Germany), and 1976 (Montreál, Canada). As of 2008, Haiti had not participated at a Winter Olympics. The delegation that Haiti sent to Beijing included seven athletes across three sports. With four female athletes, more women participated for Haiti in Beijing than at any single Olympic games before. Prior to Beijing, athletes from Haiti had won one silver medal (by Silvio <b>Cator</b> in 1928) and one bronze medal (by five athletes in 1924). Between then and including the 2008 Olympics, Haitian athletes had not won medals in any event. Moise Joseph, an athlete of the University of Florida, was destined to participate for Haiti in Beijing, but did not compete.|$|E

Stade Sylvio <b>Cator</b> is the multi-purpose stadium in Port-au-Prince, where it is currently used mostly for association football matches that fits a capacity of 10,000 people. In 1974, the Haiti national football team were only the second Caribbean team to make the World Cup (after Cuba's entry in 1938). They lost in the opening qualifying stages against three of the pre-tournament favorites; Italy, Poland, and Argentina. The national team won the 2007 Caribbean Nations Cup.|$|E
25|$|The British tunnellers {{got into}} the German gallery system from a British tunnel {{and were able to}} {{demolish}} the system on 12 March, which relieved the threat of another German mine attack. Skirmishing around the craters diminished and it was thought that the Germans were concentrating on consolidating new positions. On 18 March, the Germans surprised the British with five mines which had been quietly dug through the clay layer above the chalk. The German attack had nearly as much success as the British attack on 2 March, forcing back the British to the original front line, before local counter-attacks regained some of the craters. When the fighting died down after 19 March, both sides occupied the near lips of the craters. Brigadier-General <b>Cator,</b> the 37th Brigade commander, recommended that attempts to occupy craters should end and the near lips be held instead, because craters were death traps against howitzer and mortar fire and because observation from the crater lip was obstructed by its convex shape and large lumps of chalk brought to the surface by the explosions.|$|E

500|$|As NY350 departs <b>Cator</b> Corners, it curves {{back to the}} north, leaving Macedon Center Road—the east–west roadway that NY31F {{follows from}} <b>Cator</b> Corners west to the county line—to {{continue}} east as a county road. NY350 continues across rolling farmland {{to the town of}} Walworth, where it meets the eastern terminus of NY441 at a four-way intersection with Walworth–Penfield Road west of the hamlet of Walworth. The route continues on, entering a slightly more forested area as it heads toward a junction with NY286 at Atlantic Avenue.

500|$|New York State Route350 (NY350) is a north–south {{state highway}} in western Wayne County, New York, in the United States. It extends for [...] from an {{intersection}} with NY31 and NY31F {{in the village}} of Macedon to a junction with NY104 in the town of Ontario. NY350 serves as the eastern terminus for three routes: the aforementioned NY31F, NY286, and NY441, all of which originate in the Rochester area. Aside from the village of Macedon at its south end and the hamlet of Ontario Center at its north terminus, NY350 serves mostly rural areas dominated by farmland. NY350 was assigned [...] to the portion of its routing south of <b>Cator</b> Corners, the north junction with NY31F. It was extended northward to its current terminus in the 1940s.|$|E
500|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, the segment of current NY350 between Atlantic Avenue and Ridge Road {{became part of}} an extended NY35, which had ended at a junction west of the village of Avon in Livingston County prior to 1930. The extension took NY35 northeastward through Monroe and Wayne Counties to a new terminus {{in the town of}} Ontario. NY35 entered Wayne County on modern NY286 (Atlantic Avenue) and followed Atlantic Avenue and Ontario Center Road north to NY3 (Ridge Road; later U.S. Route104 or US104). By the following year, the portion of Ontario Center Road from <b>Cator</b> Corners to NY33 (Walworth–Penfield Road; now NY441) was designated as part of NY33B.

The conjoined routes cross over the Erie Canal and an industrial railroad spur off of the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision before exiting the village and entering the surrounding town of Macedon. NY31F and NY350 pass through forested areas up to an overpass carrying the Rochester Subdivision line over the road, at which point the wooded areas give way to open fields. The two routes split roughly [...] north of Macedon at a junction named <b>Cator</b> Corners.

The 37th Brigade commander, Brigadier-General <b>Cator,</b> reported that the interiors of craters were mantraps. The craters attracted artillery and mortar fire but gave no protection, being confined spaces with a morass of liquid chalk and black mud at the bottom, which was unusable as a material for fortification. Building up crater lips with a parados (the embanked rear lip of the trench) or hurdles and boards failed, because shellfire soon dislodged them and the inner sides collapsed into the crater. Defending the forward lip had proved difficult, due to its breadth and the presence of clay mounds [...] high, which obstructed the field of fire. <b>Cator</b> recommended that the near lips of craters or a line beyond them were better positions and the interiors of craters left empty, with positions maintained on the rear lips.|$|E

Instead of building a single composite indicator (score) for each region, we calculate many composite indices by combining different weighting systems and rules of normalization and aggregation. In this way, we get a distribution function of the ranks (and a plausible rank range) for each country. Such an approach represents a good compromise between the need of synthesising the information provided by many variables and the need to avoid the loss of relevant information that occurs when several indicators are aggregated into a single composite index...|$|R
