25|$|Rudolph and Ludwig {{summon the}} city's inhabitants. They stage a mock quarrel and conduct the rigged {{statutory}} duel as planned: Rudolph's king is beaten by Ludwig's ace, making Ludwig the Grand Duke. Rudolph's subjects berate him with scorn, and he retreats, threatening revenge. Ludwig uses his new powers {{to extend the}} Act for another hundred years, thus ensuring that neither Rudolph nor Ernest <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> life.|$|E
25|$|Once he is alone, Rudolph {{reads the}} letter and learns about the plot to blow him up. Ludwig arrives, intent on denouncing the plot to him. Before he can do so, Rudolph {{declares}} that he would give anything to avoid being blown up the next day, and Ludwig sees a way out. He feigns patriotism and suggests that the two engage in a statutory duel. He explains that they will hide cards up their sleeves, guaranteeing victory to Ludwig. When the plot unfolds, Ludwig will {{bear the brunt of}} it. The next day, when the Act authorizing statutory duels expires, Rudolph <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> life unharmed. Although Rudolph is sceptical, he accepts Ludwig's proposal.|$|E
500|$|On December 21, 2008, LenDale White and Keith Bulluck of the Tennessee Titans {{stepped on}} a Terrible Towel after the Titans's 31–14 victory. Pittsburgh's Larry Foote responded, [...] "They {{deserved}} to do that, they whooped us, they deserve to celebrate and, hopefully, we'll see them again." [...] While Hines Ward said, [...] " [...] did kind {{of the same thing}} and you see where they went." [...] Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher, by this point working for CBS as an analyst on The NFL Today, mentioned on the program that such antics <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> haunt teams. Tennessee was the top seed in the playoffs, however following the incident the Titans proceeded to lose eight consecutive games, including an '08 divisional playoff game and their '09 Week 1 game against the Steelers, 13-10. After the Titans' 8th consecutive loss—a 59-0 blowout to the New England Patriots, the Titans worst loss ever—Titans coach Jeff Fisher expressed regret for his team's behavior towards the Towel, and a number of Titans players autographed a Terrible Towel and mailed it to Allegheny Valley School – the Pittsburgh charity that now owns the trademark. The Titans won their next 5 games.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the cancellation, Anderson was {{required}} {{to come up with an}} idea for another Supermarionation series. He had once been inspired by the thought of creating a live-action police drama in which the hero would have unexpectedly been murdered halfway through the series and replaced by a new lead character. Now giving fresh consideration to this idea, Anderson resolved that a selling point for his new series could be a character that can be killed at the end of each episode and resurrected by the beginning of the next. This, coupled with contemporary theories about the possibility of life on Mars, led to the idea of an interplanetary war raging between Earth and its neighbour and a worldwide security organisation being called on to defend human civilisation. After further thought, Anderson decided that [...] "Scarlet" [...] would make an unusual codename for this organisation's [...] "indestructible" [...] agent who <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> life, while [...] "Blue" [...] could be his partner's designation. From this, Anderson reasoned that all the personnel should have colours for names so as to form the whole [...] "Spectrum" [...] of colours, and decided that someone called [...] "White" [...] should be the leader of the Spectrum Organisation, much in the same way that white light is composed of, and can be broken down into, the colours of the spectrum.|$|E

2500|$|After a brief slump, Mantle {{was sent}} {{down to the}} Yankees' top farm team, the Kansas City Blues. However, {{he was not able}} to find the power he once had in the lower minors. Out of frustration, he called his father one day and told him, [...] "I don't think I can play {{baseball}} anymore." [...] Mutt drove up to Kansas City that day. When he arrived, he started packing his son's clothes and, according to Mantle's memory, said [...] "I thought I raised a man. I see I raised a coward instead.

2500|$|At the 2006 U.S. Open, {{played on}} the West course of the Winged Foot Golf Club, Montgomerie had yet another chance to win his first major championship. He {{stood in the middle}} of the 18th fairway in the final round having sunk a 50-foot birdie putt on the 17th green, which put him in the joint lead with Phil Mickelson. While waiting in {{position}} on the 18th fairway for the group in front to finish, Montgomerie switched his club from a 6-iron to a 7-iron, assuming adrenaline would kick in. Once the wait was over, he hit the approach shot poorly, ending up short and right of the green, in thick rough. He pitched onto the green, and then three-putted from 30 feet to lose the tournament by one stroke. After the loss, Montgomerie said, [...] "At my age I've got to think positively. I'm 43 next week, and it's nice I <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> this tournament and do well again, and I look forward to coming back here again next year and trying another U.S. Open disaster."
