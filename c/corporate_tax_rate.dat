Instead, Bevin announced that he would release his jobs plan later in the week and chided the local media for focusing on issues other than the economy. On May 1, Bevin released the promised jobs plan, which called for a gradual reduction of the federal <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> to 10% over five years, allowing companies to return overseas profits to the United States with a 10% tax assessment, and passage of a federal right-to-work law. Saying that burdensome regulations from agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency were harmful to business' ability to create jobs, he endorsed the REINS Act, which would require congressional approval of any executive regulation with an economic impact of more than $100 million. He also proposed a flat income tax and opposed an increase in the federal minimum wage.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1990 s the SADC {{region has}} closely {{followed}} declining trends {{that occurred in}} the industrialised world in terms of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to find appropriate explanations behind these trends as experienced in the SADC region. A cross-section panel, including the so-called Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR), is applied to uncover the main determinants of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> in the region. The main findings of the paper acknowledge the vulnerability of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> to global influence. The presence-of-trade variable relating to openness and international pressure takes precedence in the determination of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> The results indicate that higher trade ratios mean lower statutory corporate rates as international influence intensifies. It also tends to confirm the region’s dependency on trade for tax revenues, but also its ability to still attract tax revenues from capital flows. Some evidence exists in terms of an association between the government expenditure-GDP ratio and the statutory and average <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates,</b> although this is not definitive.

25|$|The {{economy of}} the Republic of Ireland {{expanded}} rapidly during the Celtic Tiger years (1995–2007) due to a low <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate,</b> low ECB interest rates, and other systemic factors (such as soft surveillance of banking supervision including against observance of Basel Core Principles, underdeveloped public financial management and anti-corruption systems and adoption of poor policies including a corporate tax system that fostered non-tradable goods and services through the construction industry). At {{the end of the}} third quarter of 2010, German banks had between US$186.4 billion and $208.3 billion in total exposure to Ireland with $57.8 billion in exposure to Irish banks. This led to an expansion of credit and a property bubble which petered out in 2007.

While openness {{does not seem to}} be systematically related to <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates,</b> our findings suggest that countries compete over statutory <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> In contrast, we do not find competition over effective marginal rates. While the short-run impact of <b>tax</b> competition on <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> seems to be modest, the interplay of tax competition and a sluggish adjustment of <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> over time implies that permanent shocks to individual countries have substantial long-run effects on equilibrium tax levels in all countries. <b>corporate</b> <b>taxes,</b> tax competition, openness...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the implications of}} foreign firm ownership and international profit shifting through thin capitalization for <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> policy. We consider a model of interjurisdictional tax competition where the <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> serves as a backstop to the personal income tax, interest on debt is deductible from the <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> base and multinational firms may shift profit across countries through thin capitalization. We show {{that the problem of}} thin capitalization induces countries to reduce their <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> below the personal income <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> and to broaden their tax bases. Moreover, foreign firm ownership leads to a reduction in <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> We also show that there is scope for welfare enhancing tax coordination in our model. In the presence of both foreign firm ownership and thin capitalization, countries gain from a coordinated increase in <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> or from a coordinated broadening of the tax base. tax competition, income shifting...|$|R

25|$|As Finance Minister, Netanyahu {{undertook}} {{an economic}} plan {{in order to}} restore Israel's economy from its low point during the Second Intifada. Netanyahu claimed that a bloated public sector and excessive regulations were largely responsible for stifling economic growth. His plan involved a move toward more liberalized markets, {{although it was not}} without its critics. He instituted a program to end welfare dependency by requiring people to apply for jobs or training, reduced the size of the public sector, froze government spending for three years, and capped the budget deficit at 1%. The taxation system was streamlined and taxes were cut, with the top individual tax rate reduced from 64% to 44% and the <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> from 36% to 18%. A host of state assets worth billions of dollars were privatized, including banks, oil refineries, the El Al national airline, and Zim Integrated Shipping Services. The retirement ages {{for both men and women}} were raised, and currency exchange laws were further liberalized. Commercial banks were forced to spin off their long-term savings. In addition, Netanyahu attacked monopolies and cartels to increase competition. As the Israeli economy started booming and unemployment fell significantly, Netanyahu was widely credited by commentators as having performed an 'economic miracle' by the end of his tenure.|$|E
