5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made to extend the trams with another <b>center</b> <b>section,</b> adding another axle and articulation, but these plans have been {{rejected}} by the company. Such a <b>center</b> <b>section</b> would be low-floor and give much easier access for strollers and wheelchairs, and allow the whole tram network to have step-free access. As of 2008, it was estimated that the SL79-series has about ten more years of service before it needs to be replaced. No plans {{have been made}} for new trams to be ordered.|$|E
5|$|A mockup of the cockpit, center {{fuselage}} and wing <b>center</b> <b>section</b> {{was built}} and was inspected by the BuAer {{in the fall}} 1944. However, the contract for the prototype XTSF-1s was terminated in January 1945. This was due {{to a variety of}} factors, including the Navy's belief that the Grumman engineers and factory were already at capacity producing the F6F Hellcat, the F7F, and the F8F Bearcat, that the XTSF-1 would be too large for practical operations from escort carriers, and because it was believed the Grumman G-70, to be built as the XTB3F, was a better prospect. In addition, the F7F was proving difficult to certify for operations from aircraft carriers, further prejudicing the Navy against the design.|$|E
5|$|The He 111Z-2 {{could carry}} four Henschel Hs 293 anti-ship missiles, which were {{guided by the}} FuG 203b Kehl III missile control system. With this load, the He 111Z had a range of 1,094km (680mi) and a speed of 314km/h (195mph). The maximum bombload was 7,200kg (15,870lb). To {{increase}} power, the five Jumo 211F-2 engines were slated to be fitted with Hirth TK 11 superchargers. Onboard armament {{was the same as}} the He 111H-6, with the addition of one 20mm MG 151/20 in a rotating gun-mount on the <b>center</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E

5|$|The company bought five bogie trams. They {{had pointed}} ends to ease meeting the shorter trams in the city, {{and had a}} low-floor <b>center</b> <b>section,</b> with {{internal}} steps. The body and mechanical equipment was built by Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk, while the electrical components were built by Siemens-Schuckertwerke. Capacity was for 40 or 38 seated passengers. In early 1917, Barth was replaced by H. A. Mørk as director. Trial runs of the tramway started on 11 June 1917. It was retrospectively decided by the ministry that the official opening date was 1 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} a spar on the front left of the wing separated, quickly followed by the lower rear spar and the connections which attached the outer wing to the <b>center</b> <b>section.</b> The loss of the left wing caused the aircraft to roll left, whereupon the fuselage and the right horizontal stabilizer collided with the separated wing. The initial separation was caused either by a wind gust in excess of operating velocity, or a similar lower-velocity gust after the material had become fatigued.|$|E
5|$|Zavod Nr. 39built 16Pe-3s in August, {{including}} the prototype, 98in September and 82in October before the factory was evacuated to Irkutsk late in October. Production was restarted in April 1942 {{with a total}} of 132 built during the year. All were Pe-3bis models except for eleven Pe-3s that had not been completed before the evacuation. Thirteen were built in 1943before production was canceled in favor of Ilyushin Il-4 bombers. A final production batch of 19was built at Zavod Nr. 22in early 1944, but these were more lightly armed than earlier versions, with only a single ShVAK cannon in the wing <b>center</b> <b>section</b> and one UBK in the nose. The bomb racks in the engine nacelles were eliminated entirely, as was the fixed ShKAS machine gun in the tail. Two DAG-10 grenade launchers were fitted in the rear fuselage, each with ten grenades.|$|E

50|$|Another cm-wavelength {{experiment}} was built at Werneuchen, east of Berlin, known as Jagdschloss Z. This system operated on a 9 cm wavelength, {{which was very}} short for the era. The antenna was built up from the <b>center</b> <b>sections</b> of the Würzburg radar's parabolic dish, stacked vertically to form a single 72-wavelength aperture antenna.|$|R
5|$|According to Morgan, {{the town}} hall was {{designed}} for multiple uses and this {{is evident from the}} plans and the exterior of the building. The largest section, the <b>center</b> <b>section,</b> serves as the government function and has municipal offices on the first floor. A stairwell to the right leads to the second floor, which functions as a town meeting room. A secondary entrance on the western facade accesses the northern section of the building, previously a library. The southern section of the building was previously a high school with separate entrances for boys and girls. The second floor of the southern section was used by the Antiquarian Society for meetings and its collections. In 1917, the original library was moved to the southern section following the completion of the Leander R. Peck School. Two additions to {{the town hall}} were made to expand the library. The two additions consisted of two parallel gable units that matched the original material and form of the town hall, the first addition was made in 1938 by Howe & Church and the second in 1963 by Michael Traficante.|$|E

50|$|Major {{portions}} of the wings, engines, and <b>center</b> <b>sections</b> were found in two craters 150 ft apart, however {{the breakup of the}} entire aircraft was extensive. The considerable amount of fuel ignited on ground impact, according to fire patterns. The fires were so intense that despite efforts to extinguish them they continued to burn for three days.|$|R
25|$|Given {{the known}} {{height of the}} flood wave, and that within seventy minutes or less after the {{collapse}} the reservoir was virtually empty, the failure must have been sudden and complete. Seconds after it began, little {{of what had been}} the dam remained standing, other than the <b>center</b> <b>section</b> and wing wall. The main dam, from west of the <b>center</b> <b>section</b> to the wing wall abutment atop the hillside, broke into several large pieces, and numerous smaller pieces. All of these were washed downstream as 12.4 billion gallons (47 billion liters) of water began surging down San Francisquito Canyon. The largest piece, weighing 10,000 tons, (9,071,847kg) was found about three-quarters of a mile (1200m) below the dam site.|$|E
25|$|Entry {{into the}} cockpit and {{passenger}} cabin were from the upper surface of the wing <b>center</b> <b>section.</b> Access was through bi-fold doors latched at the bottom. Both doors were equipped with a center hinge allowing the doors, when opened, to lay folded onto the upper surface of the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The days {{following}} the Maine disaster were chaotic. Some of the twisted wreckage of the <b>center</b> <b>section</b> and bow jutted high out of the water. At low tide, the decks of the <b>center</b> <b>section</b> of the ship were just under water, while the stern (which angled upward) was slightly out of the water. At high tide, all of the ship except the bow wreckage, the main mast, and the aft-mast was under water. The site of the disaster was quickly but not immediately secured by the Spanish Navy and Cuban colonial government. Souvenir seekers and the well-meaning nonetheless often accessed the wreck. Divers, most of them Cubans, were employed by the United States to bring bodies to the surface. Pieces of the ship lay {{some distance from the}} wreck, and some items washed ashore days or even weeks later.|$|E
50|$|A few V-2 <b>center</b> <b>sections</b> {{had been}} {{assembled}} by the Raxwerke when on November 2, 1943, the US Fifteenth Air Force targeted the nearby Wiener Neustädter Flugzeugwerke (WNF) plant in Operation Crossbow {{and hit the}} Raxwerke. Rax test equipment was subsequently moved {{to the site of}} the Redl-Zipf brewery in central Austria (code name Schlier) where V-2 test stands were built.|$|R
2500|$|The {{variants}} of the B-29 were outwardly similar in appearance but {{were in fact}} built around different wing <b>center</b> <b>sections</b> that affected the wingspan dimensions. [...] The wing of the Renton built B-29A-BN used a different subassembly process and was a foot longer in span. The Georgia built B-29B-BA weighed less through armament reduction. A planned C series with more reliable R-3350s was not built.|$|R

25|$|Since 2001, Brooklyn Tech has {{undergone}} such refurbishing as {{the renovation of}} the school's William L.

25|$|In a {{somewhat}} similar phenomenon, the dam portion {{east of the}} <b>center</b> <b>section</b> had also broken into several larger and smaller pieces.

5000|$|On the school's website it states, [...] "A twenty-acre {{site was}} chosen for the East Side area’s first co-institutional high school."
