40|$|The {{arrival of}} new {{cephalosporins}} faces the clinician with an evergrowing confusion {{as to the}} drug of choice. The older agents (cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor) and the newer formulations <b>cefatrizine</b> and cefuroxime axetil are intensively used for treatment of mild and moderate infections. The oldest agents have a better pharmacokinetic profile but are less active against Gram-positives and Gram-negatives. Cefaclor, <b>cefatrizine</b> and cefuroxime axetil have improved in vitro activity against H. influenzae and/or against S. aureus and M. catarrhalis.

40|$|<b>Cefatrizine</b> was {{administered}} intravenously and orally at dose levels of 250, 500, and 1, 000 mg to normal male volunteers in a crossover study. Intravenous pharmacokinetics were dose linear over this range; mean peak plasma concentrations {{at the end}} of 30 -min infusions were, respectively, 18, 37, and 75 micrograms/ml, total body clearance was 218 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, renal clearance was 176 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, and mean retention time in the body was 1. 11 h. Cumulative urinary excretion of intact <b>cefatrizine</b> was 80 % of the dose, and half-lives ranged from 1 to 1. 4 h. Steady-state volume of distribution was 0. 22 liters/kg. On oral administration, the absolute bioavailabilities of <b>cefatrizine</b> were 75 % at 250 and 500 mg and 50 % at 1, 000 mg. The mean peak plasma concentrations and peak times were, respectively, 4. 9, 8. 6, and 10. 2 micrograms/ml at 1. 4, 1. 6, and 2. 0 h, mean residence times were 2. 4, 2. 6, and 3. 1 h, and mean absorption times were 1. 3, 1. 6, and 1. 9 h. Oral renal clearance and half-life values corresponded well to the intravenous values. Cumulative urinary excretion of intact <b>cefatrizine</b> (as percentage of dose) was 60 at 250 mg, 56 at 500 mg, and 42 at 1, 000 mg. It is hypothesized that the lack of oral dose linearity between the 500 - and 1, 000 -mg doses is due to a component of <b>cefatrizine</b> absorption by a saturable transport process. Relative absorption at the high dose would be sufficiently slow that an absorption "window" would be passed before maximum bioavailability could be attained. It is not expected that the observed bioavailability decrease at doses exceeding 500 mg will have any therapeutic significance, since clinical studies are establishing efficacy for a recommended unit dosage regimen of 500 mg...|$|E

These modifications were inspired us {{to concentrate on the}} carboxyl side chain of ibuprofen to design novel class of molecules. During the synthesis of these analogues, we planned to utilize Click chemistry as key reaction. Click reaction {{is one of the most}} popular reactions for the construction of triazoles. Concept of this reaction discovered by the groups of Sharpless (Rostovtsev et al. 2002) and Meldal (Tornøe et al. 2002) independently. It is a copper(I)-catalyzed 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction which involves alkyne and azide as key partners to deliver 1, 2, 3 -triazoles. Click chemistry has recently emerged to become a powerful tool in drug discovery. The 1, 4 -disubstituted 1, 2, 3 -triazoles obtained from CuAAC reactions are found to possess wide applications in several research fields including synthetic organic (Liu et al. 2008; Wacharasindhu et al. 2009), biological (Romeo et al. 2015) and medicinal chemistry (Liang et al. 2015). 1, 2, 3 -Triazole is one of the key structural unit found in a wide variety of bioactive molecules tazobactam (Yang et al. 1999), <b>cefatrizine</b> (Dunn et al. 1976), carboxyamidotriazole (Guo et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis for}} estimating {{the extent of}} intestinal peptide and peptide analogue absorption was developed {{on the basis of}} a mass balance approach that incorporates convection, permeability, and reaction. The macroscopic mass balance analysis (MMBA) was extended to include chemical and enzymatic degradation. A microscopic mass balance analysis, a numerical approach, was also developed and the results compared to the MMBA. The mass balance equations for the fraction of a drug absorbed and reacted in the tube were derived from the general steady state mass balance in a tube: [formula: see text] where M is mass, z is the length of the tube, R is the tube radius, Pw is the intestinal wall permeability, kr is the reaction rate constant, C is the concentration of drug in the volume element over which the mass balance is taken, VL is the volume of the tube, and vz is the axial velocity of drug. The theory was first applied to the oral absorption of two tripeptide analogues, cefaclor (CCL) and <b>cefatrizine</b> (CZN), which degrade and dimerize in the intestine. Simulations using the mass balance equations, the experimental absorption parameters, and the literature stability rate constants yielded a mean estimated extent of CCL (250 -mg dose) and CZN (1000 -mg dose) absorption of 89 and 51 %, respectively, which was similar to the mean extent of absorption reported in humans (90 and 50 %). It was proposed previously that 15 % of the CCL dose spontaneously degraded systematically; however, our simulations suggest that significant CCL degradation occurs (8 to 17 %) presystemically in the intestinal lumen.

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{association}} between colonization by two newly classified species of genital ureaplasmas (Ureaplasma parvum and U. urealyticum) in early pregnancy and subsequent late abortion or preterm birth at < 34 weeks of gestation, four species of genital mycoplasmas—Mycoplasma genitalium, M. hominis, U. parvum, and U. urealyticum—as well as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were examined by PCR-based methods in a prospective cohort study of 877 women with singleton pregnancies at < 11 weeks of gestation. Antibiotics were used only in cases in which C. trachomatis and/or N. gonorrhoeae was detected. Multivariate logistic-regression {{analysis was used to}} assess independent risk factors after taking maternal low body weight and past history of preterm birth into account. M. genitalium, M. hominis, U. parvum, U. urealyticum, C. trachomatis, and N. gonorrhoeae were detected in 0. 8 %, 11. 2 %, 52. 0 %, 8. 7 %, 3. 2 %, and 0. 1 % of these 877 women, respectively. Twenty-one (2. 4 %) women experienced late abortion or preterm birth at < 34 weeks of gestation. Three factors—detection of U. parvum in the vagina (odds ratio [OR], 3. 0; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 1 to 8. 5); use of antibiotics, such as penicillin and <b>cefatrizine,</b> for incidental inflammatory complications before 22 weeks of gestation (OR, 4. 2; 95 % CI, 1. 6 to 10. 0); and past history of preterm birth (OR, 10. 4; 95 % CI, 2. 7 to 40. 5) —were independently associated with late abortion and preterm birth. In conclusion, vaginal colonization with U. parvum, but not U. urealyticum, is associated with late abortion or early preterm birth...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{pharmacokinetics}} of extracellular solutes {{is determined}} by the blood-tissue exchange kinetics and the volume of distribution in the interstitial space in the different organs. This information can be used to develop a general physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model applicable to most extracellular solutes. Methods The human pharmacokinetic literature was surveyed to tabulate the steady state and equilibrium volume of distribution of the solutes mannitol, EDTA, morphine- 6 -glucuronide, morphine- 3 -glucuronide, inulin and β-lactam antibiotics with a range of protein binding (amoxicillin, piperacillin, <b>cefatrizine,</b> ceforanide, flucloxacillin, dicloxacillin). A PBPK data set was developed for extracellular solutes based on the literature for interstitial organ volumes. The program PKQuest was used to generate the PBPK model predictions. The pharmacokinetics of the protein (albumin) bound β-lactam antibiotics were characterized by two parameters: 1) the free fraction of the solute in plasma; 2) the interstitial albumin concentration. A new approach to estimating the capillary permeability is described, based on the pharmacokinetics of the highly protein bound antibiotics. Results About 42 % of the total body water is extracellular. There is a large variation in the organ distribution of this water – varying from about 13 % of total tissue water for skeletal muscle, up to 70 % for skin and connective tissue. The weakly bound antibiotics have flow limited capillary-tissue exchange kinetics. The highly protein bound antibiotics have a significant capillary permeability limitation. The experimental pharmacokinetics of the 11 solutes is well described using the new PBPK data set and PKQuest. Conclusions Only one adjustable parameter (systemic clearance) is required to completely characterize the PBPK for these extracellular solutes. Knowledge of just this systemic clearance allows one to predict the complete time course of the absolute drug concentrations in the major organs. PKQuest is freely available [URL]. </p...|$|E
40|$|Maternal-fetal {{transfer}} of cefazolin was investigated {{with use of}} a single 14 -mgjkg intramuscular dose administered to 40 gravidas before elective hysterectomy. The half-life of cefazolin in maternal serum was 1. 5 hr with mean concentrations at 2 and 4 hr of 39 and 16 JLg/ml, respectively. By microbiological assay, cefazolin was not detected in brain, cerebrospinal fluid, lung, liver, or kidney of the fetus but was present in concentrations of 1 - 11 JLg/ml in 12 of 27 individual samples of fetal serum from 0. 75 to 10. 66 hr. Cefazolin appeared in fetal urine from 2. 17 to 19. 5 hr at levels of < 5 JLg/ml with a half-life of 5. 4 hr. Cefazolin was present in the amni· otic fluid of fetuses older than 14 weeks in concentrations of < 1 JLg/m 1 from 9 to 21. 75 hI. After administration of a single dose to the mother early in pregnancy, the fetal distribution of cefazolin {{is limited to the}} body fluids. Cefazolin is a broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin that has been available for clinical use since June 1973. Comparative pharmacologic studies in adults have shown that cefazolin reaches higher levels in blood, has a longer ser-um ql 2, a smaller apparent volume of dis-tribution, a lower rate of renal clearance, less renal toxicity, and a higher level of protein binding than cephaloradine, cephalexin, cepha-lothin, and <b>cefatrizine</b> [1 - 6]. These qualities may affect not only how much cefazolin is avail-able to the fetus but the fetal pharmacology of this antibiotic as well. The purposes of this investigation were {{to determine the extent of}} transer of maternally administered cefazolin to the fetus and to identify the distribution and concentration of this cephalosporin in the tissues and body fluids of the conceptus in the first half of gestation [...] Materials and Method...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefatrizine</b> (S- 640 P, 1 g/day, p. o.) and {{ampicillin}} (AB-PC, 1 g/day, p. o.) {{were administered}} to 150 cases of acute urinary tract infections, and the efficacy of these drugs was compared with double blind procedure. Except 5 drop-out cases (2 in S- 640 P, and 3 in AB-PC), which had not visited the hospital after first administration of the drugs, the background of 145 cases were analyzed according to 33 articles, and {{it was to be}} satisfied in its uniformity as the subject of this trial. The final evaluation of therapeutic effect of each drug was decided according to the individual evaluation of the effect on urinary microorganism, urinary findings, and general status of the patients, except the side-effect. These results were analyzed statistically, and no significant difference was observed between these evaluations. Furthermore, x 2 -test, Wilcoxon's procedure, and calculation of several coefficients of correlation were carried out, but any significant difference between the action of these drugs could not be observed. As the side-effect, blister formation on the mucous membrane (1), exanthema (3), diarrhea (2), and slight increase of s-GOT and Al-P-ase (1) were observed in S- 640 P group; blister formation on mouth lip (1), decrease of neutrophilic leucocyte and increase of lymphocyte (1), exanthema (1), and increase of s-GOT, s-GPT and Al-P-ase (1) were found in AB-PC group. But all of these were slight and temporary, and these needed neither suspension of drug administration nor some available therapies. The clinical efficacy of S- 640 P was 74. 0 % on the 4 th day of administration and 72. 6 % on the 8 th day of administration, while the efficacy of AB-PC was 69. 0 % on the 4 th day and 76. 6 % on the 8 th day of administration. With the results obtained above, it was concluded that S- 640 P and AB-PC should have almost the same therapeutic effect on the simple acute urinary tract infections...|$|E
40|$|Use {{of small}} organic {{molecules}} in asymmetric organic transformations has been popularly increasing {{every year since}} the turn of this century. The disadvantages {{associated with the use of}} transition metal-based catalysts in organic synthesis can be overcome by using small organic molecules; organocatalysts. In comparison to other firmly established asymmetric catalysis fields such as enzymatic catalysis and organometallic catalysis, organocatalysis offers some fundamental advantages: In general, organocatalysts can be used in a wider range of solvents and for a broader scope of substrate in comparison to enzymes. In addition, they are naturally less toxic and less sensitive towards oxidation and moisture than most organometallic based reagents. This work describes the development of two peptide based triazole organocatalysts for the asymmetric Michael addition reactions. These two catalysts were prepared from simple amino acids L-proline and L-asparagine using simple and scalable click and acid-amine coupling reactions. Synthesised catalysts were evaluated for their catalytic activity in asymmetric Michael addition reaction of cyclohexanone to various nitro olefins which produced Michael adducts with high (up to 99 %) enantio- and diastereoselectivities. In addition, transition state energies of four possible enamine-nitrostyrene transition states i. e anti-re, anti-syn, syn-re and syn-si were computationally calculated and these computational or modelling studies revealed the possible reaction&nbsp;mechanism which proceed via formation of anti enamine-re nitrostyrene transition state. Besides developing proline-triazole peptides for organocatalysis, it was of parallel interest to prepare and investigate hybrid triazole derivatives for anti-cancer properties. Cancer chemotherapy- in short can be described as treatment of cancer with drugs or chemical substances which kills cancer cells. Currently, 50 % of patients are undergoing chemotherapy, to remove micro metastasis. However, chemotherapy is able to cure about 10 - 15 % of all cancers. Development of drug resistance in cancer cells to the existing anticancer drugs and undesirable effects of the drugs used in cancer treatment stimulates the need of developing new anticancer agents which selectively kills the cancer cells. Many triazole containing compounds exhibit extensive range of pharmacological activities including potent anticancer properties, for instance, <b>cefatrizine,</b> tazobactam and carboxyamidotriazole. Whereas, 5, 10 -dihydro- 11 H-dibenzo[b,e][1, 4]diazepin- 11 -one derivatives have diverse therapeutic applications in medicinal chemistry. Diazepinomicin is an unusual farnesylated-dibenzodiazepinone secondary metabolite isolated from micromonospora also contains the dibenzodiazepinone skeleton, possesses anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory activity, has also demonstrated in vivo activity in mouse models against breast, prostate, glioma tumours and induced cytotoxicity in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. It was anticipated that, the combination of two pharmacophores dibenzodiazepinone and triazole may produce chemical entities with good anti-cancer and/or other biological properties. Work in Chapter IV describes the preparation of a series of dibenzodiazepinone-triazole hybrid derivatives and their cytotoxic activity evaluation in five human cancer cell lines. Among the tested dizepinone derivatives, compounds without substitution on benzene ring (attached to triazole) exhibited potent tumour growth inhibition in all tested cancer cell lines. The simple synthetic preparation and their biological properties make these dibenzodiazepinone-triazole scaffolds promising new entities for the development of cancer therapeutics...|$|E
