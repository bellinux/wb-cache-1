40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) study of non-reacting and reacting flows within a scramjet model, and for the latter the flow domain is fueled with liquid fuel and operated at shock tunnel flow conditions. This scramjet model includes an isolator, a combustion chamber and a diffuser duct. The liquid fuel is injected through lower surfaces before the cavity flame-holder. The primary goal {{of the study is}} to evaluate the detailed cavity based flame stabilization. Those CFD-predicted wall pressure distributions with available experimental data firstly to evaluate the simulation model, thus to understand underlying combusting flow physics. For the "combustion off" cases, as the distance of the <b>corner</b> <b>plate</b> increase, the boundary layer thickness of the downstream from the rear wall of the cavity increase; the entrainment air flow into the cavity and the recirculation zones in the cavity also vary with this distance changes. For the "combustion on" cases, the distance affects the position of the fuel rich regions and where the air and fuel mixture reactions occur. Despite short penetration depth of fuel injection from the simulation, the desired cavity flame stabilization has been partially achieved in the cavity flow field. The cavity flame stabilization provides a mechanism by which combustion can be achieved with mild intake compressions, which leads to greater intake efficiency (with less total pressure loss) and overall greater scramjet performance. Future work will continue to focus on the combustion instability optimized by exploring various types of cavity and <b>corner</b> <b>plate</b> configuration and cavity-based fuel injection system...|$|E
30|$|A {{three-dimensional}} finite {{solid element}} model for Japanese traditional post-and-beam connections was developed using the wood foundation method, which employed {{the concept of}} a beam on a nonlinear foundation. The wood foundation in the model was a three-dimensionally prescribed zone surrounding a nail shank in order to address the intricate wood crushing behavior induced by nail slip. Material models for the wood members and the foundation were developed based on the transversely isotropic plasticity from the software package ANSYS. The Japanese post-and-beam connection modeled was a ten-nail multiple connection with a mortise and tenon joint and is called the CPT (<b>Corner</b> <b>Plate,</b> T-shaped) connection. Details of the model development are presented. As a feasibility study, blind predictions of the model were compared with available connection test data and showed good results for predicting the progress of the load-deformation relations in three dimensions. However, the limitation of the model was found in simulating fracture failures such as wood splitting or nail tear-out from the wood. Model applications and the need for model improvement are discussed.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{nonlinear}} post buckling {{response of}} X-Braced Moment Resisting Frame (X-BMRF) systems are studied. The X-BMRF comprises of X-bracing diagonals {{attached to the}} moment frame by <b>corner</b> gusset <b>plates</b> to form the structural system acting as a dual frame. In common practice today, one of the X-bracing diagonal members is discontinuous, and a middle gusset plate is used to connect the diagonals to {{each other at the}} intersection. In this study, the effect of mid-connection details and different types sizes of <b>corner</b> gusset <b>plate</b> connection are well measured to evaluate behavioral characteristics of the above systems. An accurate and robust three-dimensional finite element modeling of the above systems validatedverified against available test data and numerical simulation are demonstrated. Then, a number of X-BMRFs are designed and analyzed under monotonic (and cyclic) loading(s), and later ductility values and energy dissipation ratios of such systems are appraised. The results are used to evaluate the secondary yield mechanisms, probable failure modes, and to quantify the loading share of story shear when different rigidity ratios between the X-bracing and moment frame systems are deliberated. Finally, the results can provide a suitable ground to present a new set of balanced design criteria which can improve nonlinear performance and assure maximum system ductility of such system...|$|R
