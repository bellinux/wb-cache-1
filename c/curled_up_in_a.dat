5|$|During the game's loading points, Isaac {{is shown}} <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ball, crying. His {{thoughts}} are visible, ranging among rejection {{from his mother}} and humiliation from his peers to a scenario involving his own death. The game features 13 possible endings, one after each major boss fight.|$|E
5|$|A nocturnal animal, the Bengal slow loris has {{excellent}} night vision, {{enhanced by}} a tapetum lucidumâ€”a layer of {{tissue in the}} eye that reflects visible light back through the retina. It sleeps during the day <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ball in dense vegetation or in tree holes. Males and females mark their territory with urine. The species is known to live in small family groups. Animals may practice social grooming.|$|E
25|$|Chrysopelea ornata is {{a common}} snake and has adapted well to human habitats. In {{southern}} parts of Thailand, they are reported {{to hide in the}} thatch of the roofing material inside bungalows to prey on geckos and mice during the night. In these areas, one can almost be certain to be relatively close to a C. ornata most anywhere, perhaps hiding in the crown of the nearby coconut palm, under the roots of a tree, or even <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> potted plant. When hunting and pursuing fleeing prey, they have been reported to drop down out of the crown of coconut palms. Snakes are often indiscriminately killed, as many locals incorrectly assume all snakes are venomous. C. ornata is sometimes cooked for food.|$|E

50|$|Their head is {{seen only}} as a partial head {{because they have no}} brain or eyes, but they are still {{responsive}} to possible predators and waves by creating suction or <b>curling</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ball.|$|R
5000|$|... 1995: Andrew Hume {{named it}} in his Netlib {{polyhedral}} database as the echidnahedron (the echidna, or spiny anteater is a small mammal that is covered with coarse hair and spines and which <b>curls</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ball to protect itself).|$|R
60|$|By and {{by one of}} the Merry Little Breezes found Johnny Chuck all <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> funny round ball.|$|E
6000|$|... "Education isn't begun yet." [...] This was a Philadelphian, <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner. [...] "That boy gets {{two hundred}} a month pocket-money, he told me. He isn't sixteen either." ...|$|E
60|$|Captain Jim's small nephew Joe {{had come}} down to spend New Year's with his great-uncle, and had fallen asleep on the sofa with the First Mate <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> huge golden ball at his feet.|$|E
60|$|In the tabledrawer {{he found}} an old number of Titbits. He folded it under his armpit, {{went to the door}} and opened it. The cat went <b>up</b> <b>in</b> soft bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ball on the bed.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the eggs}} hatch 7-10 days later, small yellow larvae that darken rapidly emerge. The {{caterpillars}} are solitary nighttime feeders in early stages, when they <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] "j" [...] shaped pattern {{during the day}} and resemble two-toned bird droppings.|$|R
50|$|The long-eared {{hedgehog}} {{is smaller}} than the West European hedgehog; it weighs between 250-400 grams, and is much faster. It {{is less likely to}} <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ball when approached by predators and will rather try and outrun or leap at predators with their relatively short needles.|$|R
60|$|He {{made several}} calls at various houses {{along the river}} during the forenoon. After dinner he {{suddenly}} turned his horse towards the Palmer place. Isaac Galletly, comfortably <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> neighbour's chimney corner, saw him drive past.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, {{when the}} rest of you {{squirrels}} are out and about, he is <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little ball in his nest, fast asleep. Timmy likes the night, especially the early evening, and doesn't like the light of day." ...|$|E
6000|$|This periphrasis was needful, because Rose was <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{corner with}} a book, and her {{accessibility}} to outward impressions was dubious. It might be partly for that reason, partly from {{the tone of}} fixed resolve in his voice, that Ermine made answer, [...] "As you please." ...|$|E
5000|$|A few {{species of}} Selaginella are desert plants known as [...] "resurrection plants", because they <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tight, brown or reddish ball during dry times, and uncurl and turn {{green in the}} {{presence}} of moisture. Other species are tropical forest plants that appear at first glance to be ferns.|$|R
60|$|The big living-room of the ranch-house {{was warm}} and {{comfortable}} with its red adobe walls, its huge stone fireplace where cedar logs blazed, and its many-colored blankets. Bo Rayner sat before the fire, <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> armchair, absorbed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> book. On the floor lay the hound Pedro, his racy, fine head stretched toward the warmth.|$|R
500|$|... 1995: Andrew Hume {{named it}} in his Netlib {{polyhedral}} database as the echidnahedron"...and some odd solids including the echidnahedron (my name; its actually the final stellation of the icosahedron)." [...] (the echidna, or spiny anteater [...] is a small mammal that is covered with coarse hair and spines and which <b>curls</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ball to protect itself).|$|R
6000|$|... "Finally old Mother Nature {{came to his}} {{relief and}} brought him some water. Then she led him {{to his home in}} the great hollow in the big {{chestnut}} tree, and when she had seen him <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tight little ball among the dried leaves she put him into the long sleep as she had old King Bear.|$|E
60|$|The {{holidays}} came, {{when she}} was free. She {{spent most of her}} time running on by herself, <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> squirrel-place in the garden, lying in a hammock in the coppice, while the birds came near--near--so near. Oh, in rainy weather, she flitted to the Marsh, and lay hidden with her book in a hay-loft.|$|E
60|$|She {{was half}} <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{corner of the}} settee, her head resting {{slightly}} upon her long fingers, her brown eyes steadily fixed upon her companion. There was an atmosphere about her of serious yet of tender things. Dominey's face seemed to fall into more rigid lines as he realised the appeal of her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I might add," [...] said Old Mother Nature, [...] "that {{when he goes}} {{to sleep}} for the winter he <b>curls</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little ball with his long tail wrapped around him, and in his bed of soft grass he sleeps very sound indeed. Like Johnny Chuck he gets very fat before going to sleep. Now, Nimbleheels, show us how you can jump." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not all winter, but a {{good part}} of it," [...] replied Bobby. [...] "I don't turn in until the weather gets pretty cold, and it is hard to find {{anything}} to eat. But after the first snow I'm usually ready to sleep. Then I <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> warm bed of leaves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> certain big hollow tree, and don't care how cold or stormy the weather is. Sometimes I wake up once or twice, when the weather is mild, and take a little walk around for exercise. But I don't go far and soon return to sleep." ...|$|R
50|$|In this third-season episode, Inque returns, fully recovered. Her latest {{job is to}} {{sabotage}} a satellite launch. Batman attempts to intervene. Inque demonstrates a new trick to avoid freezing (she <b>curls</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ball to protect most of her mass, then breaks free), but Batman reveals he installed electroshock circuitry to counter her smothering attempts. She succeeds in her mission, but is betrayed by her client, who uses a particle weapon to destabilize her molecular structure. Wounded {{and in need of}} more mutagen to heal herself, Inque turns to the one person she can trust: her spoiled daughter, Deanna Clay (voiced by Azura Skye).|$|R
60|$|Ella, {{with a book}} in her hand, was <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{corner of}} a sofa {{standing}} awry among various other articles of furniture {{that seemed to have}} tumbled together by chance within the barn-like room. Minna began moving first one and then the other, daintily wiping off the dust, and restoring an air of comfort.|$|E
60|$|To wash up {{is not an}} {{exciting}} operation. To wash up in August became for Noel a process which taxed her strength and enthusiasm. She combined it with other forms of instruction {{in the art of}} nursing, had very little leisure, and in the evenings at home would often fall asleep <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large chintz-covered chair.|$|E
60|$|So down in {{the middle}} of that soft, warm bed Timmy the Flying Squirrel, <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little round ball with his flat tail wrapped around him, slept peacefully, and on top of that soft bed Whitefoot the Wood Mouse rested and {{wondered}} what he should do next. Not in all the Green Forest could two more timid little people be found than the two in that old home of Drummer the Woodpecker.|$|E
5000|$|In other respects, {{she offered}} him much advice and, as Walker recalls from her account of being <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{armchair}} nearby, {{all the while}} offering comments and criticism while Verdi was composing, he speculates that [...] "she must have sung many of these world-famous melodies {{for the first time}} from the manuscript sketches." [...] At one point he took her advice not to have to compose on order by a certain date, but to find a suitable subject, then compose the music at his own convenience, and then find a suitable venue and suitable singers, and he so informed Corticelli, the theatrical agent from Bologna.|$|R
60|$|She {{led the way}} up-stairs {{into the}} cool, white drawing-room, with its flower-perfumed {{atmosphere}} and its delicate, shadowy air of repose. She <b>curled</b> herself <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner of the divan and gave him his coffee. Then she leaned {{back and looked at}} him.|$|R
60|$|Lazy Margaret had pleaded a {{headache}} and <b>curled</b> herself <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> window-embrasure with the express {{intention of doing}} nothing at all; but Ursula, with a burning desire for freedom and a longing for flowers, birds, and sunshine, had wandered out into the open.|$|R
60|$|Lord Arranmore obeyed her literally. He {{jerked the}} volume lightly into a {{far corner of}} the room and came over to her side. She was <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> huge easy-chair, and her face caught by the glow of the dancing firelight almost startled him by its youth. There was not a single sign of middle age in the smooth cheeks, not a single grey hair, no sign of weariness in the soft full eyes raised to his.|$|E
60|$|The commonest {{dream of}} my early {{childhood}} {{was something like}} this: It seemed that I was very small and that I lay <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sort of nest of twigs and boughs. Sometimes I was lying on my back. In this position it seemed that I spent many hours, watching the play of sunlight on the foliage and the stirring of the leaves by the wind. Often the nest itself moved back and forth when the wind was strong.|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} the fisher's trail {{into the woods}} and found him <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hollow stump. He made slight resistance as I pulled him out. All his ferocity was already lulled to sleep in the vague, dreamy numbness which Nature always sends to her stricken creatures. He suffered nothing, apparently, though he was fearfully wounded; he just wanted to be let alone. Both eyes were gone, and there was nothing left for me except to finish mercifully what little Quoskh had left undone.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's very trying, but {{we never}} can make her commy la fo," [...] added Amy, who sat making some new frills for herself, with her <b>curls</b> tied <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very {{becoming}} way, two agreeable things that made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike.|$|R
60|$|Heron {{had stepped}} briskly in, closely {{followed}} by de Batz. The man Dupont with a mutter of satisfaction {{put down his}} lanthorn and <b>curled</b> himself <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner of the antechamber. His interest in the spectacle so favoured by citizen Heron had apparently been exhausted by constant repetition.|$|R
6000|$|After {{the meal}} the two <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> {{together}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> thicket, the man's black head pillowed upon the tawny {{side of the}} panther. [...] Shortly after dawn they awoke and ate again, {{and then returned to}} the beach that Tarzan might lead the balance of the pack to the kill.|$|R
