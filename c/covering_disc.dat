If the {{dilatation}} is compactly supported, then the induced map on {{the boundary of}} the <b>covering</b> <b>disc</b> D is differentiable with non-zero derivative {{on a set of}} Hausdorff dimension 1. As one of the corollaries, we show that there are quasi-symmetric homeomorphisms over divergence-type groups such that for all sets E the Hausdorff dimension of E and f(E c) cannot both be less than 1. This shows an important difference between finitely generated and divergence-type groups. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{answer a}} {{question}} of Atienza et al. [4] by showing that the circular CCG problem is NP-complete. If we cover a set of objects on the plane with discs whose in-teriors are pairwise disjoint, then we can form a cover contact graph (CCG) that records which of the cover-ing discs touch at their boundaries. When the input objects are themselves discs, and both input and cover-ing discs are constrained to be touching and above the x-axis, then the circular CCG problem is to decide {{the existence of a}} covering with a connected CCG. We also de ne an approximate version of this problem by allow-ing a small overlap between <b>covering</b> <b>discs,</b> and give an algorithm that in polynomial time nds an approximate solution for any yes-instance of the exact problem. ...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate performance of different mechanisms regarding straw mobilization, employed in a no-till seeder. The experimental area was conducted on clayey soil under no-tillage with a large quantity of sorghum residue. The experiment was established in a randomized block design, as the treatments consisted of a combination of two mechanisms at front of the furrow opener composed of cutting disc and row cleaners, and three mechanisms behind the seed furrower, <b>covering</b> <b>discs</b> prototype model M 1, Spider and commercial model, with the combination of cutting disc and Spider model not being evaluated. We assessed the coverage permanence on soil index, vegetation mass on surface and inside the line. The treatment containing the row cleaner mechanism efficiently removed straw from the surface of sowing line as well as the return one acted on straw replacement. It was identified that use of the cutting disc at the front of seeder contributed to the increase of straw installation inside the line, three times more than in the row cleaner system when operating individually. Covering mechanism with row cleaners reduced straw inside the line and kept line covering similar to treatment of cutting disc operating alone...|$|R

40|$|Continuum {{percolation}} {{models in}} which each point of a two-dimensional Poisson point process is the centre of a disc of given (or random) radius r, have been extensively studied. In this paper, we consider the generalization in which a deterministic algorithm (given the points of the point process) places the discs on the plane, {{in such a way}} that each disc covers at least one point of the point process and that each point is covered by at least one disc. This gives a model for wireless communication networks, which was the original motivation to study this class of problems. We look at the percolation properties of this generalized model, showing that an unbounded connected component of discs does not exist, almost surely, for small values of the density lambda of the Poisson point process, for any covering algorithm. In general, it turns out not to be true that unbounded connected components arise when lambda is taken sufficiently high. However, we identify some large families of covering algorithms, for which such an unbounded component does arise for large values of lambda. We show how a simple scaling operation can change the percolation properties of the model, leading to the almost sure existence of an unbounded connected component for large values of lambda, for any covering algorithm.
