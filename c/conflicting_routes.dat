5000|$|Where {{traffic density}} {{warranted}} it, multiple tracks could be provided, {{each with a}} timetable-defined flow of traffic which would {{eliminate the need for}} frequent single track-style [...] "meets." [...] Trains running counter to this flow of traffic would still require train orders, but other trains would not. This system was further automated by the use of Automatic Block Signaling and interlocking towers which allowed for efficient and failsafe setting of <b>conflicting</b> <b>routes</b> at junctions and that kept trains following one another safely separated. However any track that supported trains running bi-directionally, even under ABS protection, would require further protection to avoid the situation of two trains approaching each other on the same section of track. Such a Mexican standoff not only represents a safety hazard, but also would require one train to reverse direction to the nearest passing point.|$|E

In this contribution we outline our approach of developing a UML-based Railway Interlocking System. The feasibility of the basic functionality is demonstrated by simulation. In order to verify the system under development, we apply model checking for the verification of specifications that belong to a single object. We tackle the state space explosion problem in those cases in which a number of objects is related to a checking condition by the application of multi-object checking. As multi-object checking is only limited by the state space of the largest object (a point in our case), multi-object checking will be applied successfully to verify the system (e. g ensure the absence of <b>conflicting</b> <b>routes).</b> First results of a case study promise the near future of fully automatic verification of complete station layouts and all desired routes...|$|E

30|$|Interlocking {{system is}} a safety control system which supervises correct {{movement}} in a train yard. Since {{it is a real}} time safety critical system, it required modeling and exhaustive verification to prevent errors being introduced into the final built design. We have used time automata framework to model this system by extracting real time constraints from this safety critical system. In this paper we presented the designed model and verification of automated interlocking system model of Rawalpindi Cantt train yard in UPPAAL toolbox (Larsen et al. 1997). The simplicity and modularity of the constructed design enables us to add or delete routes in a yard or append more wayside equipment into the already existing routes with ease. Thus, if there is a new development in the yard, causing an increase in <b>conflicting</b> <b>routes</b> for a particular route, the adjustment in the design is simply an addition of a boolean variable(s) in the route selection automata of that route. It is advisable for every up-gradation of the routes, conflict tables should be made, as shown in this study, which will help in portraying the overall effect of an addition or deletion on the whole system.|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{important}} role in providing safe conditions for train movements, railway interlocking systems are considered as safety critical systems. The reliability, safety and integrity of these systems, relies on reliability and integrity of all stages in their lifecycle including the design, verification, manufacture, test, operation and maintenance. In this paper, the Automatic generation and verification of interlocking control tables, {{as one of the}} most important stages in the interlocking design process has been focused on, by the safety critical research group in the School of Railway Engineering, SRE. Three different subsystems including a graphical signalling layout planner, a Control table generator and a Control table verifier, have been introduced. Using NuSMV model checker, the control table verifier analyses the contents of control table besides the safe train movement conditions and checks for any conflicting settings in the table. This includes settings for <b>conflicting</b> <b>routes,</b> signals, points and also settings for route isolation and single and multiple overlap situations. The latest two settings, as route isolation and multiple overlap situations are from new outcomes of the work comparing to works represented on the subject recently...|$|E
40|$|During rail operations, {{unforeseen}} {{events may}} cause timetable perturbations, which {{ask for the}} capability of traffic management systems to reschedule trains and to restore the timetable feasibility. Based on an accurate monitoring of train positions and speeds, potential <b>conflicting</b> <b>routes</b> can be predicted in advance and resolved in real time. The adjusted targets (locationtime-speed) would be then communicated to the relevant trains by which drivers {{should be able to}} anticipate the changed traffic circumstances and adjust the train's speed accordingly. We adopt a detailed alternative graph model for the train dispatching problem. Conflicts between different trains are effectively detected and solved. Adopting the blocking time model, we ascertain whether a safe distance headway between trains is respected, and we also consider speed coordination issues among consecutive trains. An iterative rescheduling procedure provides an acceptable speed profile for each train over the intended time horizon. After a finite number of iterations, the final solution is a conflict-free schedule that respects the signaling and safety constraints. A computational study based on a hourly cyclical timetable of the Schiphol railway network has been carried out. Our automated dispatching system provides better solutions in terms of delay minimization when compared to dispatching rules that can be adopted by a human traffic controller. © 2007 IEEE...|$|E

This proved to be more confusing than helpful to the casual traveler, so in 1924, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO, later AASHTO) called for a national system of interstate highways. Of the 75,884 mi proposed by AASHO, nearly 3000 mi were allocated to Iowa. [...] Support for the system was unanimous among Iowa transportation officials and the new national routings and route numbers were assigned in 1925.

Any cross-activation of Pben promoter by XylS ought {{to cause a}} metabolic conflict during the degradation of m-xylene because 3 -methylbenzoate (3 MBz) generated as an intermediate can be channelled through the ortho pathway and produce toxic dead-end metabolites. The activation of Pben by XylS was revisited using both reporter technology and tiling arrays targeted to the sequences of interest around messenger RNA initiation of both Pben and Pm promoters. Analysis of supersensitive luxCDABE fusions, inspection of xylX versus benA transcripts and growth tests of benR mutants indicated that the natural expression ranges of XylS under various conditions are insufficient to cause a significant cross-regulation of Pben whether cells face endogenous or exogenous 3 MBz.

30|$|After having {{received}} confirmation via “confirmNoccu”, that the intended route is not occupied, the automaton moves to next state “point_order” which directs the required points to assume their positions via “activate” action message. This message calls upon the point driver timed automaton into action which passes {{the message of}} “topconfirm”, in-case of successful operation or “toperror”, in-case of failure to do the required task. The failure leads the automaton to the “clearance” state and then eventually to the initial state by releasing all the <b>conflicting</b> <b>routes</b> for operation by resetting the boolean variables. After successful operation of the points, “signal_order” state is reached, which finally orders the traffic signals to assume green color via “signalorder” action message to allow trains to enter the route. “signalorder” message instantiates the signals driver timed automata, which responds to route selection automaton with the messages of “allgreen” and “lterror” for success and failure, respectively. The failure to change lights to their green colors results in the automaton coming in the “end_wait” state. In this state the automaton is waiting for all the lights to be turned red (some might have been turned green previously in the sequence) via the “ended” synchronized reception channel {{which leads to the}} “clearance” state. All the out of play routes are again made available by resetting the boolean route variables and the automaton comes back to its initial state. Upon successful change of lights to green, the automaton comes in the “ready” state, which immediately leads to “end_wait” state, where the automaton is waiting for the train to pass the route and lights be turned to red via the “ended” synchronized reception channel. The automaton arrives at its initial state by releasing all the previously locked routes.|$|E
