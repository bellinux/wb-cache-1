5|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} <b>Chagas</b> <b>disease</b> {{are due to}} cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an inflammatory response, cellular lesions, and fibrosis. For example, intracellular amastigotes destroy the intramural neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart aneurysms, respectively. If left untreated, <b>Chagas</b> <b>disease</b> can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the chronic}} stage, {{treatment}} involves managing the clinical {{manifestations of the}} disease. For example, pacemakers and medications for irregular heartbeats, such as the anti-arrhythmia drug amiodarone, may be life saving for some patients with chronic cardiac disease, while surgery may be required for megaintestine. The disease cannot be cured in this phase, however. Chronic heart disease caused by <b>Chagas</b> <b>disease</b> is now a common reason for heart transplantation surgery. Until recently, however, <b>Chagas</b> <b>disease</b> was considered a contraindication for the procedure, since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the immunosuppression that follows surgery.|$|E

40|$|Background: Endomyocardial Fibrosis (EMF) –is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} heart with related pathology to that of late stage <b>Chaga’s</b> <b>disease.</b> Indeed, both diseases are thought to result from auto-immune responses against myocardial tissue.

40|$|ABSTRACTBACKGROUNDThere is {{evidence}} based on experimental models studies in infections by Trypanosoma cruzi, {{as well as}} histopathologic studies in individuals with <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease,</b> suggesting that ischemia {{plays a role in}} the pathogenesis of myocardial lesions in the chronic phase of the disease. These ischemic disorders are caused by microcirculatory dysregulation. Atypical angina is a common symptom in patients in the chronic phase of <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease.</b> In a large number of patients, despite the absence of significant angiographic coronary obstructions, the occurrence of perfusion abnormalities is documented by myocardial scintigraphy during stress, which is reversible after rest. METHODSThis is a single center, prospective, single cohort study, with a therapeutic intervention, followed by a late quantitative reevaluation of the myocardial perfusion defects, initially detected in patients with <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease</b> and angiographically normal coronary arteries. Myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) will be performed before and 90 days after the therapeutic intervention, using sestamibi-Tc 99 m as a radiotracer and physical exercise or vasodilation stimulation with dipyridamole as stressors. Therapeutic intervention will consist of acetylsalicylic acid (single daily dose of 100 mg) associated to verapamil (80 mg bid and a total daily dose of 160 mg). The primary endpoint of the study is a reduction> 50 % of the area of ischemic myocardium calculated by the polar scintigraphic map.

40|$|Abstract Background Pharmaceutical care is {{the direct}} {{interaction}} between pharmacist and patient, {{in order to}} improve therapeutic compliance, promote adequate pharmacotherapeutic follow-up, and improve quality of life. Pharmaceutical care may be effective in reducing complications and in improving {{the quality of life of}} patients with chronic <b>diseases,</b> like <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease,</b> while bringing a positive impact on health system costs. The morbidity and mortality indexes for patients with <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease</b> are high, especially if this heart disease is complicated by heart failure. In this setting, we hypothesize that pharmaceutical care might be an important tool for the clinical management of these patients by improving their quality of life, as a better compliance to their treatment and the avoidance and prompt correction of drug-related problems will minimize their symptoms, improve their functional class, and decrease the number of hospital admissions. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the contribution of pharmaceutical care to clinical treatment of patients with <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease</b> complicated by heart failure. Methods/design A prospective, single-center randomized clinical trial will be conducted in patients with <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease</b> complicated by heart failure. A total of 88 patients will be randomly assigned into two parallel groups: an intervention group will receive standard care and pharmaceutical care, and a control group will receive only standard care. Both groups will be subjected to a follow-up period of 12 months. The primary outcome of this trial is the evaluation of quality of life, measured by the 36 -item short-form and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include drug-related problems, exercise tolerance as measured by the standard six-minute-walk test, and compliance. Discussion Patients with <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease</b> complicated by heart failure under pharmaceutical care are expected to improve their quality of life, present with a lower incidence of drug-related problems, improve their functional capacity, and improve in their compliance to treatment.

40|$|Sudden {{death has}} been {{considered}} {{the main cause of}} death in patients with <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease.</b> Nevertheless, this information comes from a period before the introduction of drugs that changed the natural history of heart failure. We sought to study the mode of death of patients with heart failure caused by <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease,</b> comparing with non-Chagas cardiomyopathy. We examined the REMADHE trial and grouped patients according to etiology (Chagas vs non-Chagas) and mode of death. The primary end-point was all-cause, heart failure and sudden death mortality; 342 patients were analyzed and 185 (54. 1 %) died. Death occurred in 56. 4 % Chagas patients and 53. 7 % non-Chagas patients. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure mortality was significantly higher in Chagas patients compared to non-Chagas. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of sudden death mortality between the two groups. In the Cox regression model, Chagas etiology (HR 2. 76; CI 1. 34 - 5. 69; p =  0. 006), LVEDD (left ventricular end diastolic diameter) (HR 1. 07; CI 1. 04 - 1. 10; p< 0. 001), creatinine clearance (HR 0. 98; CI 0. 97 - 0. 99; p =  0. 006) and use of amiodarone (HR 3. 05; CI 1. 47 - 6. 34; p =  0. 003) were independently associated with heart failure mortality. LVEDD (HR 1. 04; CI 1. 01 - 1. 07; p =  0. 005) and use of beta-blocker (HR 0. 52; CI 0. 34 - 0. 94; p =  0. 014) were independently associated with sudden death mortality. In severe <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease,</b> progressive heart failure is the most important mode of death.

5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts {{for the first}} few weeks or months of infection.

5|$|The {{disease was}} named after the Brazilian {{physician}} and epidemiologist Carlos Chagas, who first described it in 1909. The disease was not seen as a major public health problem in humans until the 1960s (the outbreak of <b>Chagas</b> <b>disease</b> in Brazil in the 1920s went widely ignored).

Antigen of both parasite forms was obtained by sonication of the parasites followed by centrifugation. Both antigens were then conjugated to activated Sepharose 4 B.

5|$|<b>Chagas</b> <b>disease,</b> {{also known}} as American trypanosomiasis, is a {{tropical}} parasitic disease caused by the protist Trypanosoma cruzi. It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs. The symptoms change {{over the course of}} the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 8–12 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60–70% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people.|$|E
40|$|Chronic chagasic {{cardiomyopathy}} (CCC) develops {{years after}} acute infection by Trypanosoma cruzi {{and does not}} improve after trypanocidal therapy, despite reduction of parasite burden. During disease, the heart undergoes oxidative stress, a potential causative factor for arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction. Here we tested whether antioxidants/ cardioprotective drugs could improve cardiac function in established <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease.</b> We chose a model that resembles B 1 -B 2 stage of human CCC, treated mice with resveratrol and performed electrocardiography and echocardiography studies. Resveratrol reduced the prolonged PR and QTc intervals, increased heart rates and reversed sinus arrhythmia, atrial and atrioventricular conduction disorders; restored a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, improved stroke volume and cardiac output. Resveratrol activated the AMPK-pathway and reduced both ROS production and heart parasite burden, without interfering with vascularization or myocarditis intensity. Resveratrol was even capable of improving heart function of infected mice when treatment was started late after infection, while trypanocidal drug benznidazole failed. We attempted to mimic resveratrol's actions using metformin (AMPK-activator) or tempol (SOD-mimetic). Metformin and tempol mimicked the beneficial effects of resveratrol on heart function and decreased lipid peroxidation, but did not alter parasite burden. These results indicate that AMPK activation and ROS neutralization are key strategies to induce tolerance to <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease.</b> Despite all tissue damage observed in established <b>Chagas</b> heart <b>disease,</b> we found that a physiological dysfunction can still be reversed by treatment with resveratrol, metformin and tempol, resulting in improved heart function and representing a starting point to develop innovative therapies in CCC...|$|R
