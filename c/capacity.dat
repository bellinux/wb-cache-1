40|$|AbstractA {{motivation}} for this paper {{comes from the}} role of Choquet <b>capacities</b> {{in the study of}} semilinear elliptic partial differential equations. In particular, the recent progress in the classification of all positive solutions of Lu=uα in a bounded smooth domain E⊂Rd was achieved by using, as a tool, <b>capacities</b> on a smooth manifold ∂E. Either the Poisson <b>capacities</b> (associated with the Poisson kernel in E) or the Bessel <b>capacities</b> (related to the Bessel kernel) have been used. In this and many other applications there is no advantage in choosing any special member in a class of equivalent <b>capacities.</b> (Two <b>capacities</b> are called equivalent if their ratio is bounded away from 0 and ∞.) In the literature Bessel <b>capacities</b> are considered mostly in the space Rd. We introduce two versions of Bessel <b>capacities</b> on a compact N-dimensional manifold. A class Capℓ,p of equivalent <b>capacities</b> is defined, for ℓp⩽N, on every compact Lipschitz manifold. Another class CBℓ,p is defined (for all ℓ> 0, p> 1) in terms of a diffusion process on a C 2 -manifold. These classes coincide when both are defined. If the manifold is the boundary of a bounded C 2 -domain E⊂Rd, then both versions of the Bessel <b>capacities</b> are equivalent to the Poisson <b>capacities...</b>|$|R
