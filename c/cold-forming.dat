(2) Probabilistic distributions of inelastic local buckling and column buckling stresses for tubular members are derived from numerical analyses of the stress-strain models. The column buckling stress is found to be influenced by a diameter-to-thickness ratio. (3) An analysis using a simple yield line theory is found to be useful to interpret behavior of stub-columns after local buckling.

The as cold-rolled tube exhibits nonlinear elastic behavior with large recoverable strain of 2. 3 %. After annealing and aging, a nonlinear elasticity, considered as the intermediate stage between "double yielding" and normal linear elasticity, is attributable to a moderate precipitation of a phase. Quantitive relationships are established between volume fraction of a phase (V-alpha) and elastic modulus, strength as well as maximal recoverable strain (epsilon(max-R)), where the epsilon(max-R) of above 2. 0 % corresponds to the V-alpha range of 3 - 10 %.
