40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to find out to what extent muscle receptors with slowly {{conducting}} afferent fibres (group III and IV) are activated by muscular contractions of moderate force, and what kind of muscle afferents could mediate the pain of ischaemic exercise. In chloralose-anaesthetized cats, the impulse activity of single afferent units from the triceps surae muscle was recorded from dorsal root filaments during muscular contractions with intact blood supply and after occlusion of the muscle artery. Two types of responses were observed to contractions without muscular ischaemia. One was characterized by sudden onset and a graded response amplitude to contractions of increasing force. In most cases stretching the muscle was also an effective stimulus. Units showing this response behaviour were labelled <b>c.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>m</b> (contraction-sensitive with mechanical mechanism of activation). The other response type had a more delayed onset and often outlasted the exercise period; because of the unknown mechanism of activation, units of this kind were labelled <b>c.</b> <b>s.</b> x. The proportion of <b>c.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>m</b> receptors was significantly higher amongst group III than amongst group IV units. During ischaemic contractions of comparable force the <b>c.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>m</b> and <b>c.</b> <b>s.</b> x receptors exhibited an unchanged or a decreased response amplitude. Under these conditions another receptor type (N, for nociceptive) was activated which did not respond to contractions with intact blood supply. Vigorous activations during ischaemic work were only observed in group IV receptors. The majority of the 131 group III and IV units tested did not respond to contractions at all. These contraction-insensitive (c. i.) endings probably comprised different receptor populations (nociceptors, thermoreceptors, low-threshold mechanoreceptors). It is concluded that the various central nervous effects of muscular exercise without ischaemia which are known to be due to raised activity in thin muscle afferents (e. g. cardiopulmonary adjustments, spinal locomotor reflexes) are probably produced by the <b>c.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>m</b> and <b>c.</b> <b>s.</b> x types. The pain of ischaemic contractions is most likely mediated by the N receptors most of which possess non-myelinated afferent fibres...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{vertical}} component of the American College of Sports Medicine (A. <b>C.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>M.)</b> Guidelines equation to predict the oxygen cost of grade running. The A. <b>C.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>M.</b> Guidelines equation is: VO$ sb 2 $(ml/kg. min) = 3. 5 + 0. 2 speed(m/min) + 0. 9 (speed(m/min) * grade(frac)). Twenty-three female runners (20 to 33 years) participated in (1) a VO$ sb 2 $max test, (2) five 6 min running economy (RE) tests at 133 m/min, (3) five 6 min RE tests at 160 m/min, and (4) three 6 min RE tests at 186 m/min. The RE tests at 133 and 160 m/min were performed at the following grades: 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, and 10. 0 %. The RE tests at 186 m/min were performed at 0, 2. 5, and 5. 0 % grade. The RE tests were administered in random order. There was a linear relationship between VO$ sb 2 $ and horizontal running velocity with a slope of 0. 20 ml/kg. m (r = 0. 996; p $<$. 01). There was a linear relationship between VO$ sb 2 $ and percent grade when running on a treadmill. The correlations for the regression equations at speeds of 133, 160, and 186 m/min were 0. 90 (p $<$. 01), 0. 86 (p $<$. 01), and 0. 73 (p $<$. 01), respectively. Inclusion of a grade component in the regression analysis equation increased the accuracy for predicting the VO$ sb 2 $ of grade running. VO$ sb 2 $ consumption for grade running can be predicted using the following equation: VO$ sb 2 $ (ml/kg. min) = 3. 5 + 0. 198 (speed in m/min + 0. 932 grade(%)) + 0. 006 (speed(m/min) * grade(%)).
