The respirators were tested by exposing the men to tear gas in the chamber before the experiment started. Maddison was the fourth to have the drops applied, at 10:17 having twenty 10 mg drops of sarin applied to the two layers of cloth used in uniforms, serge and flannel, which had been taped to the inside of his left forearm. [...] After twenty minutes, Maddison began to sweat and complain that he did not feel well. One eye witness reported at the second inquest that he slumped over the table. The <b>contaminated</b> <b>cloth</b> was removed and he left the chamber, walking (perhaps with help) about 30 metres to a bench.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This was a {{cross-sectional}} study which aimed to determine associations between hematologic indices such as {{red blood cell}} cholinesterase (RBC) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), with illnesses related to pesticide exposure among cutflower farmers in La Trinidad, Benguet. One hundred two (102) randomly selected cutflower farmers underwent comprehensive, personal physical health and laboratory examinations and answered a questionnaire on work practices and illness. Majority were males (52 %) and most belonged to the 20 – 35 age group (45 %). Majority of exposed farmers were symptomatic, with most common complaints being headache (48 %), easy fatigability (46. 1 %) and cough (40. 2 %). Analysis showed that RBC cholinesterase levels were positively associated with age (p = 0. 02), and selling pesticide containers (p = 0. 008). {{number of years of}} using pesticides (p = 0. 022), use of <b>contaminated</b> <b>cloth</b> (p = 0. 033), incorrect mixing of pesticides (p = 0. 041), sex (p = 0. 002) and illness due to pesticides (p = 0. 005) were correlated with abnormal MCV. Significant associations were also found for hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, white blood cell (WBC) and platelet count. Predictors of RBC cholinesterase were years of pesticide use (p = 0. 037) and abnormalities on health (p = 0. 029). The findings of the study can be used for information dissemination and pesticide reduction programs for the cutflower farmers. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether enteric viruses (adenovirus, rotavirus, and hepatitis A virus) added to cotton cloth swatches survive the wash cycle, the rinse cycle, and a 28 -min permanent press drying cycle as commonly practiced in households in the United States. Detergent with and without bleach (sodium hypochlorite) was added to washing machines containing sterile and virus-inoculated 58 -cm 2 swatches, 3. 2 kg of cotton T-shirts and underwear, and a soiled pillowcase designed to simulate the conditions (pH, organic load, etc.) encountered in soiled laundry. The most important factors for the reduction of virus in laundry were passage through the drying cycle and the addition of sodium hypochlorite. Washing with detergent alone was not found to be effective for the removal or inactivation of enteric viruses, as significant concentrations of virus were found on the swatches (reductions of 92 to 99 %). It was also demonstrated that viruses are readily transferred from <b>contaminated</b> <b>cloths</b> to uncontaminated clothes. The use of sodium hypochlorite reduced the number of infectious viruses on the swatches after washing and drying by at least 99. 99 %. Laundering practices in common use in the United States do not eliminate enteric and respiratory viruses from clothes. The use of bleach can further reduce the numbers of enteric viruses in laundry...|$|R

Efficiency of water, ethanol, 2 -propanol and ethylene glycol as liquid phase for ultrasonic treatment was compared.

In all cases the COD values gradually increased {{in a time}} dependent manner from 6 % to 35 % with ethanol, from 17 % to 37 % with ethyleneglycol and from 17 % to 33 % with 2 -propanol at 10 to 60 min US mode, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the potential application of the biosurfactant from Candida lipolytica grown in low-cost substrates, which has previously been produced and characterized under optimized conditions as an adjunct material to enhance the remediation processes of hydrophobic pollutants and heavy metals generated by the oil industry and propose the formulation of a safe and stable remediation agent. In tests carried out with seawater, the crude biosurfactant demonstrated 80 % oil spreading efficiency. The dispersion rate was 50 % for the biosurfactant at a concentration twice that of the CMC. The biosurfactant removed 70 % of motor oil from <b>contaminated</b> cotton <b>cloth</b> in detergency tests. The crude biosurfactant also removed 30 – 40 % of Cu and Pb from standard sand, while the isolated biosurfactant removed ~ 30 % of the heavy metals. The conductivity of solutions containing Cd and Pb was sharply reduced after biosurfactants' addition. A product was prepared through adding 0. 2 % potassium sorbate as preservative and tested over 120 days. The formulated biosurfactant was analyzed for emulsification and surface tension under different pH values, temperatures, and salt concentrations and tested for toxicity against the fish Poecilia vivipara. The results showed that the formulation had no toxicity and did not cause significant changes in the tensoactive capacity of the biomolecule while maintaining activity demonstrating suitability for potential future commercial product formulation...|$|R
40|$|A new {{instrument}} {{has been designed}} to measure the penetration by rubbing of bacteria from <b>cloth</b> <b>contaminated</b> in the nursing of burn patients through fabrics designed for barrier garments. Most fabrics tested dry reduced the transfer of bacteria from the source cloth to about 10 %, irrespective of the results of air filter tests, which agrees with mock nursing results. When the fabrics were tested against a wet surface, the transfer of bacteria rapidly reached 100 % if the fabrics had a high wettability, but was slower for fabrics with a low wettability. Through closely woven waterproofed cotton, transfer was 5 [...] 25 %, but increased three- to four-fold after ten launderings, in line with the water absorption. Transfer through plastic-laminated material was less than 1 %. The results suggest that barrier garments should be made either of plastic or of recently waterproofed closely woven cotton at points of contact between nurse and patient where the clothes may be wetted by bacteria-containing wound secretions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: People {{are worried}} about effect of {{household}} cleaning products in the environment. One {{of the sources of}} detergent is sewage that is being used for irrigation of the crops. A laboratory experiment and a pot experiment were conducted in 2012 to determine the effect of irrigation with different doses of detergent on plant growth and seed germination traits of maize (Zea mays). The experiments included eight doses of cloth detergent (0, 0. 00002, 0. 0002, 0. 002, 0. 02, 0. 2, 2, 20 g/L). Results showed that 20 g/L of detergent severely reduced seed germination and root length. 20 and 2 g/L of detergent reduced shoot length and seedling weight. 20 g/L of detergent produced the lowest leaf area, leaf weight, stem weight and total biomass. The results demonstrated that irrigating by the sewage contaminated by household cleaning products at high concentration should be avoided. [Hassan Heidari.

40|$|ABSTRACTBiodegradation {{techniques}} {{may help}} contaminated organic wastes to become useful for plant production. The current study aimed {{to evaluate the}} efficiency of composting in the biodegradation of toxic residues from the textile industry and its use as substrate in saplings production. Cotton <b>cloths</b> <b>contaminated</b> with oil and grease, used in loom maintenance, were composted in a mixture with cattle manure. The composted material replaced coconut fiber in the substrate {{for the production of}} eucalyptus rooted cuttings: mixture of vermiculite, carbonized rice husk and coconut fiber in the ratio of 2 : 1 : 1 (v/v) and using it as control. Thus, the amount of rice husks remained unchanged and the amount of vermiculite and compost varied. The compost proportion in the tested substrates were 0, 19, 37, 56 and 75 %. The compost produced from textile wastes showed high nutrient levels and low levels of heavy metals. In general, the survival, growth and some growth indices of rooted cuttings produced on substrates with 19 and 37 % compost were similar to those of rooted cuttings grown in commercial substrate. Composting is efficient and the material is useful for rooted cuttings production...|$|R
