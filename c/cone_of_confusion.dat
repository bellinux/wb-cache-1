50|$|As the {{wavelength}} approaches {{twice the size}} of the head, phase relationships become ambiguous, since it is no longer clear whether the phase difference between the ears corresponds to one, two, or even more periods as the frequency goes up.Fortunately, the head will create a significant acoustic shadow in this range, which causes a slight difference in level between the ears. This is called the interaural level difference, or ILD (the same <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> applies). Combined, these two mechanisms provide localisation over the entire hearing range.|$|E
5000|$|The head-related {{transfer}} function {{is involved in}} resolving the <b>Cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confusion,</b> a series of points where ITD and ILD are identical for sound sources from many locations around the [...] "0" [...] part of the cone. When a sound is received by the ear it can either go straight down the ear into the ear canal {{or it can be}} reflected off the pinnae of the ear, into the ear canal {{a fraction of a second}} later. The sound will contain many frequencies, so therefore many copies of this signal will go down the ear all at different times depending on their frequency (according to reflection, diffraction, and their interaction with high and low frequencies and the size of the structures of the ear.) These copies overlap each other, and during this, certain signals are enhanced (where the phases of the signals match) while other copies are canceled out (where the phases of the signal do not match). Essentially, the brain is looking for frequency notches in the signal that correspond to particular known directions of sound.|$|E

Furthermore, it is not constant around a <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion,</b> but can vary {{by as much as}} 18 % of the maximum interaural delay.

40|$|Abstract—Generally, {{in order}} to create 3 D sound using {{binaural}} systems, we use head related transfer functions (HRTF) including the information of sounds which is arrived to our ears. But it can decline some three-dimensional effects in the area of a <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> between front and back directions, because of the characteristics of HRTF. In this paper, we propose a new method to use psychoacoustics theory that reduces the confusion of sound image localization. In the method, HRTF spectrum characteristic is enhanced by using the energy ratio of the bark band. Informal listening tests show that the proposed method improves the front-back sound localization characteristics much better than the conventional methods Keywords—HRTF, 3 D sound, Psychoacoustics, Localizatio...|$|E

The use of generic HRTFs in virtual auditory displays significantly affects the acoustic spatial resolution and the listener’s ability to make localization judgments regarding the sound sources situated inside the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> The aim of this paper is to investigate whether haptic-auditory feedback based training can enhance sound localization performance, front-back discrimination and the navigational skills of the visually impaired people. In our experiments, we assessed the sound localization performance of nine visually impaired subjects before and after a series of haptic-auditory training procedures aimed to enhance the perception of 3 D sounds. The results of our tests demonstrate that our subjects succeeded to improve their sound localization performance, reduced the incidence of angular precision and reversal errors and became able to build an effective spatial representation map of the acoustic environment...|$|E
40|$|To a first-order approximation, {{binaural}} localization cues are ambiguous: {{a number}} of source locations give rise to nearly the same interaural differences. For sources more than a meter from the listener, binaural localization cues are approximately equal for any source on a cone centered on the interaural axis (i. e., the well-known "cones of confusion"). The current paper analyzes simple geometric approximations of a listener's head to gain insight into localization performance for sources near the listener. In particular, if the head is treated as a rigid, perfect sphere, interaural intensity differences (IIDs) {{can be broken down}} into two main components. One component is constant along the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> (and thus co varies with the interaural time difference, or ITD). The other component is roughly constant for a sphere centered on the interaural axis and depends only on the relative pathlengths from the source to the two ears. This second factor is only large enough to be perceptible when sources are within one or two meters of the listener. These results are not dramatically different if one assumes that the ears are separated by 160 degrees along the surface of the sphere (rather than diametrically opposite one another). Thus, for sources within a meter of the listener, binaural information should allow listeners to locate sources within a volume around a circle centered on the interaural axis, on a "doughnut of confusion. " The volume of the doughnut of confusion increases dramatically with angle between source and the interaural axis, degenerating to the entire median plane in the limit.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThis {{dissertation}} {{provides an}} overview of my research {{over the last five years}} into the spectral analysis involved in human sound localization. The work involved conducting psychophysical tests of human auditory localization performance and then applying analytical techniques to analyze and explain the data. It is a fundamental thesis of this work that human auditory localization response directions are primarily driven by the auditory localization cues associated with the acoustic filtering properties of the external auditory periphery, i. e., the head, torso, shoulder, neck, and external ears. This work can be considered as composed of three parts. In the first part of this work, I compared the auditory localization performance of a human subject and a time-delay neural network model under three sound conditions: broadband, high-pass, and low-pass. A “black-box” modeling paradigm was applied. The modeling results indicated that training the network to localize sounds of varying center-frequency and bandwidth could degrade localization performance results in a manner demonstrating some similarity to human auditory localization performance. As the data collected during the network modeling showed that humans demonstrate striking localization errors when tested using bandlimited sound stimuli, the second part of this work focused on human sound localization of bandpass filtered noise stimuli. Localization data was collected from 5 subjects and for 7 sound conditions: 300 Hz to 5 kHz, 300 Hz to 7 kHz, 300 Hz to 10 kHz, 300 Hz to 14 kHz, 3 to 8 kHz, 4 to 9 kHz, and 7 to 14 kHz. The localization results were analyzed using the method of cue similarity indices developed by Middlebrooks (1992). The data indicated that the energy level in relatively wide frequency bands could be driving the localization response directions, just as in Butler’s covert peak area model (see Butler and Musicant, 1993). The question was then raised as to whether the energy levels in the various frequency bands, as described above, are most likely analyzed by the human auditory localization system on a monaural or an interaural basis. In the third part of this work, an experiment was conducted using virtual auditory space sound stimuli in which the monaural spectral cues for auditory localization were disrupted, but the interaural spectral difference cue was preserved. The results from this work showed that the human auditory localization system relies primarily on a monaural analysis of spectral shape information for its discrimination of directions on the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> The work described in the three parts lead to the suggestion that a spectral contrast model based on overlapping frequency bands of varying bandwidth and perhaps multiple frequency scales can provide a reasonable algorithm for explaining much of the current psychophysical and neurophysiological data related to human auditory localization...|$|E
