40|$|This {{document}} {{examines the}} background of Afghan education and recent measures taken to establish principles and a framework for development of education and training in the country. It underlines the significance {{of science and technology}} for sustainable development of Afghanistan. The document has six chapters. Chapter I considers the evolution of modern education in Afghanistan, with periods of progress and set-backs, and the present situation. Chapter II is reflections on the revival and development of education in Afghanistan and is based on the report of the Independent High Co 0 mmission for Education (2003), which the author had the honour to chair. Chapter III deals with education goals, priorities and programmes, envisaged in the National Development Strategy, prepared by the government and endorsed at a <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> (2006). Chapters IV and V focus on the role of education and science in sustainable development of Afghanistan. Chapter IV discusses the changing concept of development and the importance of its social, cultural and environmental dimensions and international consensus on the need for sustainability. [...] . Chapter V discusses the role of science and technology in economic growth, and the recommendations of the United Nations Task Force on Science, Technology and Innovation (2005) for achievement of the millennium development goals. The present situation of Afghanistan is described, and suggestions made for strengthening education and training in science and technology for sustainable development. In Chapter VI, the author proposes a science policy for Afghanistan. This chapter considers the objectives, policy guidelines and elements of a strategy for the application of science and technology for sustainable development of the country. (DIPF/Orig. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{advanced}} age deceased kidney donor: Current outcomes and future opportunities. BackgroundDue to the aging general population, deceased donors ≥ 55 years will form an increasingly {{larger proportion of}} the deceased kidney donor pool. MethodsUsing data from the United States Renal Data System, we determined the change in graft survival between 1996 and 2000 among 32, 557 recipients <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> aged 24 hours identified recipients <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> ≥ 55 years at risk for graft loss. Compared to recipients <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> < 55 years, recipients <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> ≥ 55 years established a lower initial GFR (42 vs. 56 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2, P < 0. 0001), and had less stable GFR in the first post-transplant year (- 1. 5 vs. - 0. 6 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2, P <. 0001). Recipients from donors ≥ 55 years with initial GFR ≥ 50 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 and no drop GFR during the first post-transplant year had graft survival that was superior to that <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> < 55 years with either initial GFR < 50 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 or a drop in GFR during the first post-transplant year. ConclusionDonors ≥ 55 years are a valuable resource. Despite improvements in immunosuppression, rejection, and delayed graft function, the projected increase in long-term graft survival among recipients <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> < 55 years was not shared among recipients <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> ≥ 55 years. Recipients <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> ≥ 55 years had lower initial GFR, and less stable GFR during the first post-transplant year. Limiting cold ischemic time to < 24 hours may improve outcomes among recipients <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> ≥ 55 years. Future studies to maximize initial GFR and minimize early loss of GFR in recipients <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> ≥ 55 years may lead to improved outcomes from deceased donors ≥ 55 years...|$|R

30|$|This {{calculation}} puts {{very high}} {{weight on the}} treatments with large number <b>of</b> <b>donors.</b> In the data, the number <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> varies widely across treatments, and the number <b>of</b> other-division <b>donors</b> can be very large. The number <b>of</b> same-division <b>donors</b> ranges from 1 to 8, {{with a standard deviation}} of 2, while the number <b>of</b> non-same-division <b>donors</b> varies from 1 to 45, {{with a standard deviation of}} 18. As a result, ADRZ’s calculation is particularly sensitive to the observations on other-division donors from treatments with large numbers <b>of</b> such <b>donors.</b> Because the number <b>of</b> other-division <b>donors</b> can be so much higher, the ratio of the expression in equation (1) for same-division relative to other-division states tends to get blown up by this feature of ADRZ’s calculation.|$|R

Panel data on expenditures for population and AIDS activities have been collected for 21 donor countries for the years 1996 - 2002.

Political opportunism in the timing of funds is not strong. With respect to the sharing of the ICPD burden within the group of OECD/DAC countries one can say that on an aggregated scale the burden of population assistance programs is in line with the ability to pay <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> countries.

A simple model <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> behavior is developed which takes account of the multiple objectives <b>of</b> those <b>donors,</b> and concludes that different types <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> are more or less responsive to endowment growth. These models are then tested using data provided by the Council on Aid to Education {{on a wide range of}} colleges and universities. Cross sectional work on the 1999 data is supplemented by fixed-effects analysis using a panel from the early 1980 's to 1997. The results suggest that in the very recent period there has been some crowding out and that this effect is most pronounced among particular categories <b>of</b> <b>donors.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDelayed {{immunologic}} recovery after allogeneic {{bone marrow}} transplantation (BMT) represents {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality that limits the overall success of the transplantation procedure. Recent clinical data suggest that a subset <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> dendritic cells may inhibit the graft-versus-tumor activity <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> T cells. We studied the immunoregulatory activity <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> dendritic cells in allogeneic BMT between major histocompatibility complex-disparate strains of mice. Bone marrow grafts enriched or depleted of CD 11 b− and CD 11 b+ dendritic cell subsets by immunomagnetic cell sorting were combined with small numbers of congenic splenic T cells. Recipients of CD 11 b-depleted bone marrow had significant posttransplantation expansion <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> spleen-derived CD 4 + memory T cells compared with recipients of unmanipulated bone marrow. CD 11 b depletion enhanced the antitumor activity <b>of</b> the splenic <b>donor</b> T cells without producing significant graft-versus-host disease and resulted in long-term survival after a supralethal dose of T-cell leukemia administered after BMT. Expansion <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> spleen-derived T cells was proportional to the number of CD 11 b− dendritic cells in the bone marrow graft and was associated with increased levels of serum interferon-γ. Thus, manipulating the content <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> antigen-presenting cells in allogeneic BMT is a novel strategy to activate donor memory T cells and enhance allogeneic graft-versus-leukemia effects with minimal graft-versus-host disease...|$|R
