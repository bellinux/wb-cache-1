25|$|A {{group of}} EVs and HEVs during their <b>charging</b> <b>process</b> draw very high current {{for a short}} {{duration}} of time which creates power pulsation on the grid. Power pulsation not only reduces {{the efficiency of the}} grid and cause voltage drop in the common coupling bus, but it can cause considerable frequency fluctuation in the entire system. To overcome this problem, supercapacitors can be implemented as an interface between the charging station and the grid to buffer the grid from the high pulse power drawn from the charging station.|$|E
25|$|The upward motions {{within the}} storm and winds at higher levels in the {{atmosphere}} tend to cause the small ice crystals (and positive charge) in {{the upper part of}} the thunderstorm cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from thunderstorm cloud base. This part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil. While this is the main <b>charging</b> <b>process</b> for the thunderstorm cloud, some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm (updrafts and downdrafts). In addition, there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} the <b>charging</b> <b>process</b> are still being studied by scientists, but there is general {{agreement}} {{on some of the}} basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification. The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in {{the central part of the}} storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from −15 to −25 Celsius, see figure to the right. At that place, the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets (small water droplets below freezing), small ice crystals, and graupel (soft hail). The updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward. At the same time, the graupel, which is considerably larger and denser, tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air.|$|E

The percentage change in grain size is 13.3  % during the <b>charge</b> <b>process</b> and 21.2  % in the discharge process [19]. The results obtained in our present experiments, however, show that the change in average grain size is 19.3  % during <b>charge</b> <b>process</b> and 27.8  % during discharge process, indicating that the volume change in aqueous electrolyte is more serious than that in nonaqueous electrolyte.

25|$|Jungner {{had invented}} a nickel–iron battery {{the same year}} as his Ni-Cad battery, but found it to be {{inferior}} to its cadmium counterpart and, as a consequence, never bothered patenting it. It produced a lot more hydrogen gas when being charged, meaning it could not be sealed, and the <b>charging</b> <b>process</b> was less efficient (it was, however, cheaper). However, Thomas Edison picked up Jungner's nickel-iron battery design, patented it himself and sold it in 1903. Edison wanted to commercialise a more lightweight and durable substitute for the lead-acid battery that powered some early automobiles, and hoped that by doing so electric cars would become the standard, with his firm as its main battery vendor. However, customers found his first model to be prone to leakage and short battery life, and it did not outperform the lead-acid cell by much either. Although Edison was able to produce a more reliable and powerful model seven years later, by this time the inexpensive and reliable Model T Ford had made gasoline engine cars the standard. Nevertheless, Edison's battery achieved great success in other applications such as electric and diesel-electric rail vehicles, providing backup power for railroad crossing signals, or to provide power for the lamps used in mines.|$|E

30|$|The {{electrification}} of {{the mobility}} sector comes with multiple challenges {{such as the}} lack of information on when, where, how long and how fast <b>charging</b> <b>processes</b> of electric vehicles will take place. In order to keep up with increasing power demand of <b>charging</b> <b>processes,</b> besides better predictions also the active control of <b>charging</b> <b>processes</b> will be necessary to minimize infrastructure costs. This work deals with a real-time mechanism for supporting the Power Quality (PQ) in electric distribution grids in terms of congestion and voltage management. In the paper, we propose a distributed smart charging approach that considers real-time conditions of the distribution grid provided by an event-driven architecture that collects data from different points in the grid. Our approach adopts the traffic light model, which allows smooth changing of the charging power to avoid drastic changes of the grid state. In order to be ready for real-world application, the algorithm is validated by a series of experiments on two setups: Pure software (co-)simulation and Power Hardware In the Loop (PHIL) where physical charging stations and electric cars are controlled in a laboratory setup.|$|R
