50|$|DS Norden's fleet {{is among}} the most modern and {{competitive}} in the industry and the firm operates in total 209 dry cargo- and tanker vessels (a mix of owned and <b>chartered</b> <b>tonnage).</b> In addition NORDEN has an extensive newbuilding programme and has in total 86 vessels on order (dry cargo 69, tanker 17).|$|E
5000|$|The North of England Protecting and Indemnity Association, {{generally}} {{known as}} North P&I Club, {{is a leading}} marine mutual liability insurer. It provides protecting and indemnity (P&I), freight demurrage and defence (FD&D), war risks and ancillary insurance cover and loss prevention services to around 131 million GT of owned tonnage and 54 million GT of <b>chartered</b> <b>tonnage,</b> with around 5000 ships worldwide. Through its guaranteed subsidiary Sunderland Marine, North is also a leading insurer of fishing vessels, small craft and aquaculture risks.|$|E
50|$|Houlder Brothers & Co. {{was formed}} in London 1856 and {{operated}} {{in the market for}} <b>chartered</b> <b>tonnage.</b> In 1861 the company acquired the Golden Horn, which they used on the North Atlantic routes to the United States. The company later expanded to service routes to New Zealand, Australia and the Pacific Islands. From 1875 to 1880 the company worked with John T. Arundel & Co. in a guano mining business on Flint Island in the Pacific Ocean. In 1881 the company entered the passenger and cargo trade to the River Plate.|$|E
50|$|The Union-Castle/Safmarine joint mailship service {{declined}} heavily {{during the}} 1970s. This {{was due to}} a combination of adverse economic factors including the loss of earnings from high value cargoes, which were increasingly being carried in the more efficient, revolutionary new container ships. With the large increase in oil prices in 1973, the mail ship schedule was extended by one day to allow more economical steaming. After Pendennis Castle was withdrawn in June 1976 just two mailships remained on the route - Union-Castle's Windsor Castle and Safmarine's S.A. Vaal - in addition to Union-Castle's last cargo/passenger vessels RMMV Good Hope Castle and RMMV Southampton Castle (carrying just 12 passengers each) and other <b>chartered</b> cargo-only <b>tonnage.</b> The jointly owned passenger liner service ceased completely in October 1977, with the S.A. Vaal being the last to arrive in Southampton on 10 October 1977.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the Great Eastern Railway (GER), wishing {{to compete with}} its rivals who were {{operating}} from the Kent coast to France and Belgium, obtained the rights to provide a cargo and cattle service to Rotterdam. After first using <b>chartered</b> <b>tonnage</b> they carried passengers with the paddle steamer Zealous 613 gt, built in 1864 on the Thames by J & W Dudgeon. Dudgeon also supplied the 1865 built Avalon, 670 gt, which was powered by a two-cylinder oscillating engine that gave a speed of 14 knots.|$|E
5000|$|Red Star’s Antwerp - Philadelphia Service {{started in}} January 1873. Red Star took {{delivery}} of three new steamers built in England and supplemented its fleet with <b>chartered</b> <b>tonnage.</b> [...] Red Star was in {{better position to}} survive the depression of 1873 than the US-flagged American “Keystone” Line because operating as a US carrier resulted in about 30% higher costs. At the end of 1873, Griscom took over management of the American Keystone Line. In 1874, Red Star also started an Antwerp-New York service under a mail contract from the Belgian Government.|$|E
50|$|Struggling {{to remain}} solvent {{in the wake}} of its {{disastrous}} excursion into shipbuilding, a dramatic increase in fuel costs following the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) price increases of the mid-1970s, and the rapid replacement and expansion of its fleet in the late 1970s, and a deepening business downturn, in 1980 Seatrain began divesting its <b>chartered</b> <b>tonnage</b> and cut its rates in the North Atlantic lane to attract more traffic. This set off a rate war which only added to the losses. In August Seatrain sold its transatlantic operations and the ships Seatrain Bennington and Seatrain Saratoga to Trans Freight Lines, and then concentrated on restructuring its Pacific operations under the name Seatrain Pacific Service, or Seapac.|$|E
40|$|The world {{shipping}} freight {{market for}} the transportation of bulk cargo - liquid and dry - is characterised by the somewhat erratic and extreme fluctuations exhibited {{by many of the}} measures {{that can be used to}} describe the "state" of the market. Such 'measures' include the spot freight rates - the cost to the shipper of chartering a unit of shipping capacity 'on the spot' (that is, not reserving the vessel in advance), - the proportion of <b>chartered</b> <b>tonnage</b> at any time taken on a period (time) basis as opposed to a voyage (single) basis, and the rate at which orders for new vessels reach the shipyards. These factors are extremely variable, and have exhibited a similar form of behaviour for a large number of years. This present thesis describes an attempt to investigate the behaviour of the freight market (bulk cargo); the aim of the investigation being to identify the structure of the market system and to construct a System Dynamics model which describes the complex relationships in the market and which can be used to explore questions relating to present or future market behaviour. The construction of such a model is described, together with an exhaustive chapter on the analysis of the model, covering loop-analysis, the behaviour of the model under various test inputs, and the senstivity of the model to significant changes in parameter values. The final chapter considers the use of the model, and, in particular, describes its use in an investigation of the feasibility or desirability of introducing tonnagestabilization schemes into the market. Such schemes aim to prevent the freight rates from falling to unacceptably low values, by implementing a scheme whereby tonnage is withdrawn from operation and laid-up: the decrease in the supply of tonnage then has a positive influence on the freight rates. It is concluded that the problems involved in designing such schemes preclude the schemes from implementation. The appendices cover the various data used in the determination of market relationships, as well as the computer listing, in Fortran, of the market model. Also included in an appendix is a description of the application of System Dynamics to a hypothetical company. The tcompany model' allows for the examination of chartering policies and lay-up policies under a variety of conditions of market demand...|$|E
