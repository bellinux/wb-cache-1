5|$|As of the 51st Supplement (2010) of the American Ornithologists' Union, the <b>California</b> <b>Condor</b> {{is in the}} Cathartiformes {{order and}} the Cathartidae family.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of human {{settlement}} of the Americas, the <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> was widespread across North America; condor bones from the late Pleistocene have been found at the Cutler Fossil Site in southern Florida. However, {{at the end of}} the last glacial period came the extinction of the megafauna that led to a subsequent reduction in range and population. Five hundred years ago, the <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> roamed across the American Southwest and West Coast. Faunal remains of condors have been found documented in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. The Lewis and Clark Expedition of the early 19th century reported on their sighting and shooting of California condors near the mouth of the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its {{historic}} range, the <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> {{has been a}} popular subject of mythology and an important symbol to Native Americans. Unusually, this bird takes on different roles in the storytelling of the different tribes.|$|E

5000|$|<b>California</b> <b>condors,</b> zoo-bred {{from the}} San Diego Zoo Safari Park condor program, were reintroduced into the Sierra San Pedro Martir in 1987, {{the first time}} seen in the range since 1937. Each year, {{a small group of}} young <b>California</b> <b>condors</b> are {{selected}} from the pool of birds being bred by the Los Angeles Zoo, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, Oregon Zoo, and The Peregrine Fund for release to the wild. Annual releases range from four to seven zoo-bred birds.|$|R
5|$|Governments and {{conservation}} groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird {{that would otherwise}} have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> and Norfolk parakeet.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} <b>California</b> <b>Condor</b> Recovery Plan was to {{establish}} two geographically separate populations, one in California {{and the other in}} Arizona, each with 150 birds and at least 15 breeding pairs. As the Recovery Program works toward this goal the number of release sites has grown. There are three active release sites in California, one in Arizona and one in Baja California, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the capture of all the wild individuals of the <b>California</b> <b>condor,</b> in 1988 the US Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California. Only females were released to prevent it becoming an invasive species. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America before the reintroduction of the California condors took place.|$|E

5|$|Since {{opening in}} 1962, the zoo {{has focused on}} animal {{conservation}} efforts. Programs at the Phoenix Zoo include captive breeding for reintroduction (for instance the Arabian oryx, black-footed ferret, Mexican wolf, Ramsey Canyon leopard frog, and thick-billed parrot, sanctuary for animals that are no longer breeding (for instance the African painted dogs at the zoo), and rescue and rehabilitation (for instance lead poisoning treatments for the <b>California</b> <b>condor).</b>|$|E
5|$|The adult <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> is {{a uniform}} black with the {{exception}} of large triangular patches or bands of white {{on the underside of the}} wings. It has gray legs and feet, an ivory-colored bill, a frill of black feathers surrounding the base of the neck, and brownish red eyes. The juvenile is mostly a mottled dark brown with blackish coloration on the head. It has mottled gray instead of white on the underside of its flight feathers.|$|E
5|$|As the Recovery Program {{achieved}} milestones, a fifth active {{release site}} in Sierra de San Pedro MÃ¡rtir National Park, Baja California, Mexico, {{was added to}} the three release sites in California (Big Sur, Pinnacles National Park and Bitter Creek National Wildlife Refuge) and the Vermilion Cliffs release site in Arizona. In early 2007, a <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> laid an egg in Mexico {{for the first time since}} at least the 1930s. The population of the condors has risen due to these wild and also captive nestings.|$|E
2500|$|Three <b>California</b> <b>condors,</b> Kaweah, Tyrion and [...] "432" [...] (unnamed), {{moved into}} this new exhibit on May 24, 2014. These condors came from a large {{breeding}} facility located near Estacada, Oregon.|$|R
25|$|In 1997, the Ventana Wildlife Society began {{releasing}} captive-bred <b>California</b> <b>Condors</b> in Big Sur. The birds {{take six}} years to mature before they can produce offspring, and a nest was discovered in a redwood tree in 2006. This {{was the first time}} in more than 100 years in which a pair of <b>California</b> <b>condors</b> had been seen nesting in Northern California. The repopulation effort has been successful in part because a significant portion of the birds' diet includes carcasses of large sea creatures that have washed ashore, which are unlikely to be contaminated with lead, the principal cause of the bird's mortality.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{richness}} of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the brown bear, <b>California</b> <b>condor,</b> and least Bell's vireo have become extinct in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either California or federal endangered species legislation. The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, exotic species, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills {{and the availability of}} human food have affected some wildlife species.|$|E
5|$|The Andean condor is {{the only}} {{accepted}} living species of its genus, Vultur. Unlike the <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> (Gymnogyps californianus), which is known from extensive fossil remains and some additional ones of , the fossil record of the Andean condor recovered to date is scant. Presumed Plio-Pleistocene species of South American condors were later recognized to be not different from the present species, although one known only from a few rather small bones found in a Pliocene deposit of Tarija Department, Bolivia, {{may have been a}} smaller palaeosubspecies, V. gryphus patruus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> (Gymnogyps californianus) is a New World vulture, {{the largest}} North American land bird. This condor became extinct {{in the wild}} in 1987 (all {{remaining}} wild individuals were captured), but the species has been reintroduced to northern Arizona and southern Utah (including the Grand Canyon area and Zion National Park), the coastal mountains of central and southern California, and northern Baja California. Although other fossil members are known, {{it is the only}} surviving member of the genus Gymnogyps. The species is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.|$|E

5|$|The zoo {{provides}} {{lead poisoning}} treatment for California condors from the Grand Canyon area. These birds {{are one of}} the most endangered species on the planet, having at one time been reduced to 22 individuals in the wild. In February 2006, they treated a female (#149) who had been released in the 1990s and her son (#304) who survived a very rare birth in the wild. Both birds were captured in the Grand Canyon region and brought back to the zoo to be treated. A <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> (#133) was still being treated for lead poisoning at the zoo as of March 2010.|$|E
5|$|Governments and {{conservation}} groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat, or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird {{that would otherwise}} have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> and Norfolk parakeet. The British Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, founded as the Plumage League in 1889 to protect birds such as the egret from hunting for their plumes, used in fashion, has grown to have over a million members; it has been followed by similar societies in other countries. A more specialised organisation, the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, works to conserve waterfowl and their wetland habitats, with projects around the world.|$|E
5|$|The <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> {{conservation}} project {{may be one}} of {{the most}} expensive species conservation projects in United States history, costing over $35million, including $20million in federal and state funding, since World War II. As of 2007 the annual cost for the condor conservation program was around $2.0 million per year. However, nesting milestones have been recently reached by the reintroduced condors. In 2003, the first nestling fledged in the wild since 1981. In March 2006, a pair of California condors, released by Ventana Wildlife Society, attempted to nest in a hollow tree near Big Sur, California. This was the first time in more than 100 years that a pair of California condors had been seen nesting in Northern California.|$|E

5|$|The <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. Because they lack a syrinx, their vocal display is limited to grunts and hisses. Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and grunts. This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{critically}} endangered <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> {{has also}} been affected by lead poisoning. As scavengers, condors eat carcasses of game that have been shot but not retrieved, and with them the fragments from lead bullets; this increases their lead levels. Among condors around the Grand Canyon, lead poisoning due to eating lead shot is the most frequently diagnosed cause of death. In an effort to protect this species, in areas designated as the California condor's range the use of projectiles containing lead has been banned to hunt deer, feral pigs, elk, pronghorn antelope, coyotes, ground squirrels, and other non-game wildlife. Also, conservation programs exist which routinely capture condors, check their blood lead levels, and treat cases of poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The exact taxonomic {{placement}} of the <b>California</b> <b>condor</b> and the other six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Though similar in appearance and ecological roles to Old World vultures, the New World vultures evolved from a different ancestor in {{a different part of}} the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.|$|E
50|$|Several {{rare species}} {{can be seen}} on Mount Hamilton. The Mount Hamilton jewelflower (Streptanthus callistus) is endemic to the area. In June 2011, five {{juvenile}} <b>California</b> <b>condors</b> flew over Mt. Hamilton and landed on the Lick Observatory, the species' first sighting in the area in at least 30 years.|$|R
