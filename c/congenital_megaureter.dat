40|$|Aim: Ureter or pelvicalyceal {{system is}} not be vizualized with 99 mTechnetium- dimercaptosuccinic acid (99 mTc-DMSA) which is {{accumulated}} by renal cortex normally. In this study the cases whose ureters are visible were reviewed with 99 mTc-DMSA scintigraphy. Material and Method: 18 patients (5 females, 13 males) with median age 3. 5 years (min 2 months-max 18 years) were included in this study. Twenty ureters and/or pelvis of 18 patients were visible in 99 mTc-DMSA scintigraphy. In two patients%u 2019 s both ureters were visible. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) grade, 99 mTc-DMSA uptake, renal size, status of pelvicalyceal system, urea, creatinine levels were evaluated in all patients. Results: Three of the visible ureters were actually due to pelvicaliectasis. These pelvicaliectasic patients {{were excluded from the}} study. In the evaluation of the remaining 17 ureters of patients, <b>congenital</b> <b>megaureter</b> was present in three patients. Grade 3 VUR was detected in three patients, grade 4 was in three patients. VUR is seen as grade five in eight kidneys of seven patients because one of these patients has bilateral vizualized ureter. Discussion: In patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>megaureter</b> and VUR, ureters can be visible with 99 mTc-DMSA scintigraphy and further imaging modalities are recommended for these patients...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{rare case}} of adult primary obstructive megaureter {{complicated}} by combined uric acid-oxalate lithiasis of the ureter and renal stones. A 24 -year-old male patient presented with frank hematuria on exercise of 4 years duration. The patient had an open surgery {{in the form of}} excision of stenotic segment of ureter and left ureteric re-implantation with removal of ureteric and renal stones. <b>Congenital</b> <b>megaureter</b> is a diagnosis that urologists and radiologists need to consider in the setting of isolated distal ureteral dilation, as the diagnosis of adult megaureter may require more involved surgical measures to prevent recurrence of adverse symptoms...|$|E
40|$|<b>Congenital</b> giant <b>megaureter</b> {{presents}} as abdominal {{mass and}} impose diagnostic difficulties. It can {{be associated with}} other upper urinary tract anomalies. A female newborn with antenatal diagnosis of polycystic kidneys was admitted at birth due to lower abdominal mass. Ultrasound and CT scans diagnosed a multiloculated cystic lesion in the mid and lower abdomen along with right side multicystic kidney. At laparotomy, an extaperitoneal, lobulated cystic swelling was found due to rightside giant megaureter. Its lower end was of normal caliber and orthotopic. End cutaneous ureterostomy was done. Intravenous urogram and isotope renograms showed nonfunctioning right kidney. She also had grade II vesicoureteral reflux on left side. Child suffered urinary infection twice. At 9 m age, right nephroureterectomy was done. Histopathologic examination was consistent with cystic renal dysplasia and dilated ureter. This is the first case report of giant megaureter associated with ipsilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney in newborn. ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To present our {{experience}} of laparoscopic ureteral reimplantation using intracorporeal ureteral tapering for management of distal ureteral stricture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2005 and October 2008, six patients, including 3 children and 3 adults, underwent laparoscopic modified Lich-Gregoir type extravesical ureteral reimplantation for distal ureteral stricture. Significant dilatations of proximal segment in these patients were repaired with intracorporeal ureteral tapering. Stricture etiologies were <b>congenital</b> ureterovesical <b>megaureter</b> and iatrogenic gynecologic injury in 4 and 2 patients, respectively. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 29. 3 years (range, 2 to 62 years). Mean operation time and hospital stay was 185 minutes (range, 150 to 240 minutes) and 4 days (range, 2 to 6 days), respectively. No significant complications were noted intra-operatively. Surgical procedure was performed in all the subjects laparoscopically and no conversion to open surgery happened. Postoperatively, 2 patients were complicated with febrile urinary tract infection that were managed medically. No urinary leakage occurred in early postoperative period. All the patients had patent ureterovesical junction anastomosis in follow-up imaging and recurrence of obstruction was noted in no cases. Two patients (33. 3 %) developed grade II vesicoureteral reflux. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic ureteral reimplantation with intracorporeal tapering of distal segment may be performed safely in management of patients with distal ureteral stricture and severe dilatation of proximal segment...|$|R
40|$|To report our {{experience}} of pure laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic reconstructive surgery in <b>congenital</b> <b>megaureter,</b> seven patients (one bilateral) with symptomatic <b>congenital</b> <b>megaureter</b> underwent pure laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. The megaureter was exposed {{at the level of}} the blood vessel and was isolated to the bladder narrow area. Extreme ureter trim and submucosal tunnel encapsulation or papillary implantations and anti-reflux ureter bladder anastomosis were performed intraperitoneally by pure laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. The clinical data of seven patients after operation were analyzed, including the operation time, intraoperative complications, intraoperative bleeding volumes, postoperative complications, postoperative hospitalization time and pathological results. All of the patients were followed. The operation was successfully performed in seven patients. The mean operation times for pure laparoscopic surgery and robotic-assistant laparoscopic surgery were 175 (range: 150 – 220) and 187 (range: 170 – 205) min, respectively, and the mean operative blood loss volumes were 20 (range: 10 – 30) and 28. 75 (range: 15 – 20) ml, respectively. There were no intraoperative complications. The postoperative drainage time was 5 (range: 4 – 6) and 5. 75 (range: 5 – 6) d, respectively, and the indwelling catheter time was 6. 33 (range: 4 – 8) d and 7 (range: 7 – 7) d, respectively. The postoperative hospitalization time was 7. 67 (range: 7 – 8) d and 8 (range: 7 – 10) d, respectively. There was no obvious pain, no secondary bleeding and no urine leakage after the operation. Postoperative pathology reports revealed chronic urothelia...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{presentation}} of <b>congenital</b> <b>megaureter</b> in adults is rare. Development of urolithiasis {{may lead to}} this unusual underlying diagnosis. Urinary tract stones can form either within the dilated ureteral segment or {{in a part of}} the upper urinary tract proximal to the abnormal ureteral segment. We report two cases of nephrolithiasis that occurred in adults found to have segmental megaureter. The first case is that of a 58 -year-old man who presented with left lower quadrant pain. Computed tomography scan revealed a 2 -cm stone in the distal left ureter within an area of isolated segmental distal ureteral dilation. The second case is a 48 -year-old man who developed recurrent renal urolithiasis associated with isolated distal megaureter...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{demonstrate}} didactically {{the different}} ultrasound findings of various congenital malformations of the genitourinary system. Methods: Twelve cases were retrospectively studied, comprising patients who presented with genitourinary tract malformations (with or without related symptoms), detected by ultrasound testing {{carried out with}} Phillips ATL / HDI – 5000 ultrasound equipment, {{during the period of}} August 2007 to June 2009 at the Imaging Department of the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. Rresults: Six patients were females and six were males, and ages varied from a few hours of life to 15 years and 9 months. All individuals were evaluated and accompanied by the Pediatric Radiology sector of the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. The study was carried out as follows: two cases of hydrocolpos, one of them a result of imperforate hymen and one a case a congenital stenosis of the ureteropyelic junction, one case of ureterocele, one case of bilateral double collection system, one case of horseshoe kidney, one case of Hutch’s diverticulum, two cases of pelvic kidney, one of them with hydronephrosis, one case of multicystic dysplastic kidney, one case of polycystic kidney (adult form), and one case of <b>congenital</b> <b>megaureter.</b> Cconclusions: The ultrasonographic study is a valuable method for the early identification, often in the uterus, of these and several other treatable anomalies of the genitourinary tract.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{determine}} the diagnostic value of urine biomarkers of inflammation (interleukin- 1 p, tumor necrosis factor-a), angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor) and fibrogenesis (monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1, matrix metalloproteinase- 9) to assess the severity of urodynamic obstruction of the ureter. Materials and Methods — Complex investigation of 47 children with congenital nonrefluxing megaureter at the age from 1 month till 11 years is carried. Results. The correlation between the urine level of IL- 1 p and main laboratory criteria of inflammation occurred, so IL- 1 p as an integrative indicator of pyelonephritis activity was appeared. The relation between levels of VEGF and MCP- 1 and indicators of renal hemodynamics allowed to consider increased levels of these factors as markers of irreversible nephrosclerosis. The urine level of MMP- 9 was strongly correlated with parameters of peristalyic activity of the ureter. The group of children with lower peristalyic activity of the megaureter was significantly different from group with normal ureteral peristalsis by the high urine level of MMP- 9. We do not have reliable data about the diagnostic value of determination of the urine level of TNF-a in children with <b>congenital</b> <b>megaureter.</b> Conclusion: The urine level of biological markers investigations are very important for clinical practice for determination of pyelonephritis activity (IL- 1 p), severity of ischemic deterioration of renal parenchyma (VEGF, MCP- 1). Further studies are needed to clarify the pathogenic role of MMP- 9 in the regulation of peristalyic activity of the ureter during embryonic and postnatal development in patients with congenital nonrefluxing megaureter...|$|E
