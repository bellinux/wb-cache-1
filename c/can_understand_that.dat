25|$|Several peer based organisations {{exist for}} sex workers. The aim of these organisations {{is to support}} the health, rights and well being of sex workers and {{advocate}} on their behalf for law reform {{in order to make}} working safer. Sex work is work and {{there are many people who}} willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the Sex Industry Network (SIN) when engaging with community members because peers <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> someone could willingly choose to do sex work.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{alternative}} {{theories of}} Child Development {{have been put}} forward, and empirical findings {{have done a lot}} to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during {{the first phase of the}} experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies' understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> other people have desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view that children are very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory (Lourenço & Machado, 1996).|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the embassy}} cannot be doubted. The {{distinguished}} ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of Lake Garda. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But {{we are at a}} loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender Honoria, and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, {{and at the same time}} troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stay at the club, despite interest from Chelsea, who had been acquired by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in the summer. Manager Arsène Wenger used his press conference to look ahead to the new season and felt his team's chances were as good, if not better than Chelsea's: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> we look a little bit poor and out of shape but what is important is what happens on the pitch and you will see that we look good. To write us off just because we haven't spent £100million is a bit easy." ...|$|E
500|$|Bergkamp and Wright {{scored a}} goal apiece in Arsenal's 2–0 win against Everton {{on the first}} day of March. The team won by an {{identical}} scoreline at home to Nottingham Forest a week later and kept a third consecutive cleansheet against Southampton; midfielders Stephen Hughes and Paul Shaw both got themselves on the scoresheet. Defeat at home to Liverpool on 24 March 1997 was marred by a dubious penalty awarded to striker Robbie Fowler. The player himself [...] "stood and mouthed: 'No penalty!'" [...] given Seaman made no contact in the penalty box, but the referee unaltered his decision. Although Fowler's spotkick was later saved, the ball rebounded to Jason McAteer, who scored. Wenger ruled the team out of the title race again, by saying after the match, [...] "Everybody knows now that it was not a penalty, but I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a referee took a wrong decision. That's football and it eliminates our chance of the championship." ...|$|E
500|$|Until the {{publication}} of Frederick Ponsonby's memoirs in 1951, there was little biographical material on the Munshi. Scholarly examination {{of his life and}} relationship with Victoria began around the 1960s, focusing on the Munshi as [...] "an illustration of race and class prejudice in Victorian England". Mary Lutyens, in editing the diary of her grandmother Edith (wife of Lord Lytton, Viceroy of India 1876–80), concluded, [...] "Though one <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the Munshi was disliked, as favourites nearly always are... One cannot help feeling that the repugnance with which he was regarded by the Household was based mostly on snobbery and colour prejudice." [...] Victoria biographer Elizabeth Longford wrote, [...] "Abdul Karim stirred once more that same royal imagination which had magnified the virtues of John Brown... Nevertheless, [...] insinuated into her confidence an inferior person, while it increased the nation's dizzy infatuation with an inferior dream, the dream of Colonial Empire." ...|$|E

500|$|Curry {{stated that}} the [...] "first few drafts of [...] focused on a 12-year-old boy and a mother's trial {{of trying to get}} her son out of this boy's clutches, and gradually, it became {{something}} else". In the original script, Claire was [...] "happily married", but Curry chose to have her separated due to her husband's infidelity, so that she could be a [...] "more sympathetic character". Curry was influenced by the real-life story of Mary Kay Letourneau, a teacher who became involved with her underage student, causing her to be convicted for rape charges. Director Rob Cohen revealed that in Curry's draft, the character of Noah was younger, but he made the conscious decision to age him to 19, because he felt as if it was [...] "not healthy" [...] and that audiences would lose sympathy for the protagonist. Explaining her character, Lopez stated that Claire was feeling [...] "worthless" [...] after her husband cheated, and [...] "People <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that.</b> They can understand making a mistake in a moment like that." ...|$|E
500|$|After making {{sporadic}} appearances, Wood {{was then}} announced to be returning for several episodes from December 12 to 20, 2013. Last {{appearing on the}} credits in February 2014, it was confirmed in October 2014 {{that she would not}} be returning on a more permanent basis, stating: [...] "Unfortunately we weren't on the same page contractually/scheduling etc (...) These things happen in this industry and I hope all my fans <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that.</b> I am a huge supporter of [...] Brad Bell and the entire cast and crew." [...] Wood was also removed from the soap opera's opening credits. On December 4, 2014, Soap Opera Digest broke exclusive news that Wood would be returning to the series. At press time, Wood was scheduled for a [...] "handful" [...] of episodes, which began airing on January 30, 2015. Wood revealed that she agreed to return to the show after Bell had personally sent her a text message. Of her status with the series, the actress said [...] "if the timing is right, I'll always come back". In April 2015, Wood confirmed that she signed a contract deal with the series and would return in the role of Steffy. She made her on-screen return on May 26, 2015. Wood said: [...] "When I left the show , it wasn't a real goodbye", and mentioned that [...] "Brad sent me a text with an idea for a storyline. We both got really excited about it and that was it. I was ready to go." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1792 Sophia and {{her sister}} Mary were being {{included}} in more family activities, and at age fourteen, Sophia debuted at court on her father's birthday, 4 June 1792. According to biographer Christopher Hibbert, in her young adulthood Sophia was a [...] "delightful though moody girl, pretty, delicate and passionate." [...] As within her childhood, Sophia was devoted to her father, though she occasionally found him exasperating. She wrote that [...] "the dear King is all kindness to me, and I cannot say how grateful I feel for it." [...] Prior to 1788, King George had told his daughters {{that he would take}} them to Hanover and find them suitable husbands despite misgivings he had, which stemmed from his sisters' own unhappy marriages. He remarked, [...] "I cannot deny that I have never wished to see any of them marry: I am happy in their company, and do not in the least want a separation." [...] However, the King suffered his first bout of madness that year, when Sophia was aged eleven. Sophia remarked of her father's behaviour, [...] "He is all affection and kindness to me, but sometimes an over kindness, if you <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> which greatly alarms me." [...] Further lapses into insanity occurred in 1801 and 1804, thus forestalling talk of marriage for his daughters. The question of matrimony was rarely raised; Queen Charlotte feared the subject, something which had always discomforted the King, would push him back into insanity. Furthermore, the queen, strained from her husband's illness, wanted the princesses to remain close to her.|$|E

2500|$|The {{omission}} of commonly played {{songs such as}} [...] "Run to the Hills" [...] and [...] "The Trooper" [...] from the 2010 setlist led to some criticism, with the Calgary Herald suggesting that [...] "...striking a more even balance between that new material and the unsinkable, ironclad battleships of yesteryear, would have made an incredibly satisfying show that much greater". Speaking in defence of the band's choice of setlist, Mike Portnoy (then of Dream Theater) said: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> fans {{want to hear the}} hits, but I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> Maiden don't want to be stuck playing the same songs {{for the rest of their}} lives.

2500|$|At the 1982 US Open, Evert had {{an easier}} time in {{dispatching}} her opponent Mandlíková in the final, than she had two years prior. [...] It was due to a high propensity of double faults and errant shot making, which allowed Evert even though some suspect serving of her own was able to preserve games on her racket. [...] In the fourth game of the match, Evert had a break point against her serve, but would not give it up. [...] After the match was knotted at 3-games all, Mandlíková was serving in the seventh game of the match, which she was incapable of holding serve. [...] In the next subsequent game, Evert was faced with three break points on serve. [...] Yet, unlike the Czechoslovakian, was able {{to fend off the}} points, which was a game consisting of five deuce points. [...] In the ninth game of the set, Evert broke Mandlíková again, which came off of a backhand volley in the net, and the set was won at six games to three in just 33 minutes. [...] The second set lasted only 31 minutes, and Evert won it in a romp at six games to one in a total match time of 64 minutes. [...] This win gave her the sixth US Open title for her career, which was over an eight-year timespan, which Evert said [...] "the first time you win Wimbledon or the US Open is really a thrill, but I appreciate and maybe have a place in history by winning a sixth, so I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a little better." ...|$|E
