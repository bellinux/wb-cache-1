5|$|A {{few days}} later, the monitor was {{transferred}} to Washington, D. C. and used to temporarily incarcerate some of the suspected conspirators after the assassination of President Lincoln. She was decommissioned in June and recommissioned in early 1869 for service in the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> {{off the coast of}} Florida. Saugus was again recommissioned in late 1872 and generally remained active until late 1877. She was condemned in 1886 and sold for scrap in 1891.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{evolved from}} older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by {{immigrants}} to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was {{widely recognized as}} the national sport of the United States. Baseball is currently popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the <b>Caribbean,</b> <b>and</b> East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1670s France became an {{increasing}} {{threat in the}} <b>Caribbean,</b> <b>and</b> Morgan {{took control of the}} defence of Port Royal. He declared martial law in 1678 and 1680 – both during his periods as temporary governor of the island– because of the threat of invasion, re-built the fortifications surrounding the town, and increased the number of cannon from 60 to more than 100 in the five years up to 1680.|$|E

5|$|Coccothrinax is a genus of fan palms found {{throughout}} the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> in adjacent parts of southern Florida and Mexico. Most species are small to medium-sized, with maximum heights between 5 and 15 metres (17 and 49ft). Only one of the 53 species, C. readii, is absent from the insular Caribbean. Two species, C. argentata and C. barbadensis, are widespread, {{while most of the}} others are restricted to Cuba and Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|Dominican {{popular music}} history {{can be traced}} back to the 1940s and '50s, when dance bands like the Casimir Brothers and, later, The Swinging Stars, became famous across the island. Their music was a dance-oriented version of many kinds of <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> Latin popular music, such as Cuban bolero, Brazilian samba, the merengue from the Dominican Republic, Trinidadian calypso, and American funk.|$|E
5|$|During mid-summer (July in the {{northern}} hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads {{to an increase in}} red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, in {{an attempt}} to fill the {{shortfall}} of workers and revitalise local industries, citizens of the wider Commonwealth of Nations were encouraged to migrate to Oldham and other British towns.

5|$|Four {{days after}} he left Maracaibo, Morgan returned. He was told that a Spanish defence squadron, the Armada de Barlovento, {{was waiting for him}} at the narrow passage between the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> Lake Maracaibo, where the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress was sited. The forces, under the command of Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa, had 126 cannon with which to attack Morgan, and had re-armed San Carlos de la Barra Fortress. The Spaniards had orders to end piracy in the <b>Caribbean,</b> <b>and</b> {{negotiations}} between Morgan and Espinosa continued for a week. The final offer put by the Spanish commander was for Morgan to leave all their spoils and slave and to return to Jamaica unmolested, but no agreement was reached that would allow Morgan and his men to pass the fleet with their spoils but without attack. Morgan put the Spaniards' offers to his men, who voted instead to fight their way out. As they were heavily outgunned, one privateer suggested that a fire ship aimed at Espinosa's flagship, Magdalen would work.|$|E

5|$|From August 1942 to February 1943, Berg was on {{assignment}} in the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> South America. His {{job was to}} monitor the health and physical fitness of the American troops stationed there. Berg, along with several other OIAA agents, left in June 1943 because they thought South America posed little threat to the United States, {{and they wanted to}} be someplace where their talents would be put to better use.|$|E
5|$|Galveston {{became a}} major port of entry for illegal liquor from Mexico and Canada, shipped through the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> {{distributed}} from the island throughout Texas and to other destinations. Galveston became the primary supplier for Houston, Dallas, Denver, St. Louis and Omaha. This traffic helped to offset the gradual loss of shipping traffic in the cotton and sulfur trade.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joan was a {{powerful}} hurricane that caused death and destruction in over a dozen countries in the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> Central America. Moving on a due west course for nearly two weeks in October 1988, Hurricane Joan caused widespread flooding and over 200 deaths after moving into Central America. Widespread suffering and economic crises were exacerbated by Joan, primarily across Nicaragua, as heavy rains and high winds impacted those near the hurricane's path.|$|E
