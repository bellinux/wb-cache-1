40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the rise and}} fall of an emissions trading scheme in Australia between 2007 and 2014. It offers a novel analysis of the Australian climate policy debate. The thesis develops a heterodox political economy of <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> that draws out the links between polyvalent social struggle over climate change and the process of instituting marketised climate policy. In contrast to existing depictions of the struggle over <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> as a neat division between forces for and against carbon commodification, the thesis argues that there is a more complex dynamic at play and explores the contradictions of <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> in theoretical and empirical detail. The prospects of legitimate and effective <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> cannot be asserted in principle; rather they must be examined empirically. The thesis provides evidence of the interconnections between political contestation and the brief institution of a carbon market. It details <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> policy and legislation, parliamentary debates, and contests in the media and civil society. The case of <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> in Australia illustrates that the approach to marketised climate policy adopted does not deal with, and in fact has exacerbated some pre-existing issues of governance failure in energy and land sectors. The thesis demonstrates that governance failure provides a more compelling explanation for the outcomes observed than approaches that conceptualise the political economy of <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> in terms of state failure or market failure. The normative implications of the political struggles in Australia are explored. Contestation over <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> reforms has posed a political challenge to marketised climate governance in Australia. Conservative and industry opposition is a key part to the political failures of <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing,</b> but so is the broader lack of authority of social democratic political parties, experts and environmental organisations on this issue. A popular agenda for <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> is now very far off, if not impossible. However, new strategic directions within environmentalism indicate that ‘energy politics’ is emerging as a more fruitful political arena than <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> politics...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a simple analytic approach {{for measuring the}} burden of <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> that does not require sophisticated and numerically intensive economic models but which {{is not limited to}} restrictive assumptions of forward shifting of <b>carbon</b> <b>prices.</b> We also show how to adjust for the capital income bias contained in the Consumer Expenditure Survey, a bias towards regressivity in <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> due to underreporting of capital income in higher income deciles in the Survey. Many distributional analyses of <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> focus on the uses-side incidence of <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing.</b> This is the differential burden resulting from heterogeneity in consumption across households. Once one allows for sources-side incidence (i. e. differential impacts of changes in real factor <b>prices),</b> <b>carbon</b> policies look more progressive. Perhaps more important than the findings from any one scenario, our results on the progressivity of the leading cap and trade proposals are robust to the assumptions made on the relative importance of uses and sources side heterogeneity. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{consequences}} of renewable energy policies on welfare, resource rents and energy costs {{in a world where}} <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> is imperfect and the regulator seeks to limit emissions to a (cumulative) target. We use a global general equilibrium model with an intertemporal fossil resource sector. We calculate the optimal second-best renewable energy subsidy and compare the resulting welfare level with an efficient first-best <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> policy. If <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> is permanently missing, mitigation costs increase by a multiple (compared to the optimal <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> policy) {{for a wide range of}} parameters describing extraction costs, renewable energy costs, substitution possibilities and normative attitudes. Furthermore, we show that small deviations from the second-best subsidy can lead to strong increases in emissions and consumption losses. This confirms the rising concerns about the occurrence of unintended side effects of climate policy { a new version of the green paradox. We extend our second-best analysis by considering two further types of policy instruments: (1) temporary subsidies that are displaced by <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> in the long run and (2) revenue-neutral instruments like a carbon trust and a feed-in-tariff scheme. Although these instruments cause small welfare losses, they have the potential to ease distributional conflicts as they lead to lower energy prices and higher fossil resource rents than the optimal <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> policy.

40|$|Introduction Reflecting {{the growing}} {{momentum}} for <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> worldwide, the 2015 {{edition of the}} State and Trends of <b>Carbon</b> <b>Pricing</b> report targets a wider audience {{of public and private}} stakeholders who are engaged in <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> design and implementation. This report also provides critical input for the negotiations leading up to the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Paris. As in the previous editions, the report provides an up-to-date overview of existing and emerging <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> instruments around the world, including national and subnational initiatives. Furthermore, it gives an overview of current corporate <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> instruments. To better reflect the plethora of topics being considered in the climate dialogue, the report also analyzes competitiveness and carbon leakage, and their impact on the development of <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> instruments. The task team responsible for this report intends to select new relevant topics to be explored in future editions. These topics could include, for example, the effectiveness of existing and emerging <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> instruments, and how to measure it. Finally, this year’s report gives the audience a forward-looking assessment of the advantages of international cooperation in reaching stringent global mitigation targets. A review of existing modeling work provides a qualitative and quantitative assessment of cost saving potentials and the magnitude of financial flows inherent to international cooperation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to a level consistent with the 2 °C climate stabilization goal...|$|R

40|$|Papers on optimal {{harvesting}} regimes for maximizing land {{expectation value}} (LEV) that compare different logging practices often ignore differences in variable costs and in damages on the residual stand between logging practices. We use {{data on a}} multi-age, multi-species forest in East-Kalimantan to study optimal harvest regimes for Conventional Logging (CL) and for Reduced Impact Logging (RIL). We simulate a range of <b>carbon</b> <b>prices</b> with compensation for additional carbon stored under sustainable forest management (RIL). According to our detailed data, RIL has higher fixed costs but lower variable costs than CL, and leads to less damages on the residual stand. We show that when these differences are taken into account, RIL leads to highest LEV for low to intermediate <b>carbon</b> <b>prices,</b> while for high <b>carbon</b> <b>prices</b> conventional logging is preferred. Conventional logging, however, does not qualify for carbon payments. Furthermore, we show that ignoring damages in the model leads to vast overestimations of LEV and large underestimations of optimal cutting cycles for all <b>carbon</b> <b>prices,</b> and to a different choice of logging practice for low and high <b>carbon</b> <b>prices.</b> Ignoring differences in variable costs between CL and RIL leads to small overestimations of LEV for low <b>carbon</b> <b>prices</b> and small underestimations of LEV for high <b>carbon</b> <b>prices,</b> with small to zero differences in optimal cutting cycles...|$|R
5000|$|A {{means to}} address {{a part of the}} {{external}} costs of fossil fuel generation is <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> — the method most favored by economics for reducing global-warming emissions. <b>Carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> charges those who emit carbon dioxide (CO2) for their emissions. That charge, called a 'carbon price', is the amount that must be paid for the right to emit one tonne of CO2 into the atmosphere. <b>Carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> usually {{takes the form of a}} carbon tax or a requirement to purchase permits to emit (also called [...] "allowances").|$|R
50|$|Heading {{into the}} 2013 Australian federal election, the Liberal Party {{platform}} included {{the removal of}} the 'Carbon Tax', claiming that the election was in effect a referendum on <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> in Australia.

25|$|In 2012, the Gillard {{government}} {{implemented a}} <b>carbon</b> <b>price</b> of $23 per tonne {{to be paid}} by 300 liable entities representing the highest business emitters in Australia. The <b>carbon</b> <b>price</b> will increase to $25.40 per tonne by 2014–15, and then will be set by the market from 1 July 2015 onwards. It is expected {{that in addition to}} encouraging efficient use of electricity, pricing carbon will encourage investment in cleaner renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Treasury modelling has projected that with a <b>carbon</b> <b>price,</b> energy from the renewables sector is likely to reach 40 percent of supply by 2050. Analysis of the first 6months of operation of the carbon tax have shown {{that there has been a}} drop in carbon emissions by the electricity sector. It has been observed that there has been a change in the mix of energy over this period, with less electricity being sourced from coal and more being produced by renewables such as hydro and wind power. The government at the time presented this analysis as an indicator that their policies to promote cleaner energy are working. The carbon pricing legislation was repealed by the Tony Abbott-led Australian Government on 17 July 2014. Since then, carbon emissions from the electricity sector have increased.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{electricity}} generation, the IPCC envisage that renewable energy can provide 30 to 35% of electricity by 2030 (up from 18% in 2005) at a <b>carbon</b> <b>price</b> {{of up to}} US$50/t, and that nuclear power can rise from 16% to 18%. They also warn that higher oil prices might lead to the exploitation of high-carbon alternatives such as oil sands, oil shales, heavy oils, and synthetic fuels from coal and gas, leading to increasing emissions, unless {{carbon capture and storage}} technologies are employed.|$|E

In our central case analysis, revenues from globally internalizing <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> rise to 7 % and then fall to 5 % of gross world product. High growth in India and China is the major equalizing force globally over time, but the incremental redistributive effects that can be achieved using global <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> revenues are large both in absolute and relative terms.

25|$|Photovoltaic {{power is}} also {{generated}} {{during a time}} of day that is close to peak demand (precedes it) in electricity systems with high use of air conditioning. More generally, it is now evident that, given a <b>carbon</b> <b>price</b> of $50/ton, which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5c/kWh, solar PV will be cost-competitive in most locations. The declining price of PV has been reflected in rapidly growing installations, totaling about 23GW in 2011. Although some consolidation is likely in 2012, due to support cuts in the large markets of Germany and Italy, strong growth seems likely to continue {{for the rest of the}} decade. Already, by one estimate, total investment in renewables for 2011 exceeded investment in carbon-based electricity generation.|$|E
25|$|Raising {{the price}} of carbon will achieve four goals. First, it will provide signals to {{consumers}} about what goods and services are high-carbon ones and should therefore be used more sparingly. Second, it will provide signals to producers about which inputs use more carbon (such as coal and oil) and which use less or none (such as natural gas or nuclear power), thereby inducing firms to substitute low-carbon inputs. Third, it will give market incentives for inventors and innovators to develop and introduce low-carbon products and processes that can replace {{the current generation of}} technologies. Fourth, and most important, a high <b>carbon</b> <b>price</b> will economize on the information that is required to do all three of these tasks. Through the market mechanism, a high <b>carbon</b> <b>price</b> will raise {{the price of}} products according to their carbon content. Ethical consumers today, hoping to minimize their “carbon footprint,” have little chance of making an accurate calculation of the relative carbon use in, say, driving 250 miles as compared with flying 250 miles. A harmonized carbon tax would raise the price of a good proportionately to exactly the amount of CO2 that is emitted in all the stages of production that are involved in producing that good. If 0.01 of a ton of carbon emissions results from the wheat growing and the milling and the trucking and the baking of a loaf of bread, then a tax of $30 per ton carbon will raise the price of bread by $0.30. The “carbon footprint” is automatically calculated by the price system. Consumers would still not know how much of the price is due to carbon emissions, but they could make their decisions confident that they are paying for the social cost of their carbon footprint.|$|E

First, we examine the decision to introduce a <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> policy. Second, we shed light on its stringency. Results show that both the odds of the implementation and the stringency of the <b>carbon</b> <b>pricing</b> policy are negatively affected by the share of electricity coming from coal and the relative share of industry in the economy. The results also broadly support an environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis as gross domestic product increases both the odds of the implementation and the policy stringency.

25|$|Similar to {{many other}} countries, {{development}} of renewable electricity in Australia has been encouraged by government energy policy implemented in response to concerns about climate change, energy independence and economic stimulus. A key policy {{that has been in}} place since 2001 to encourage large-scale renewable energy development is a mandatory renewable energy target, which in 2010 was increased to 41,000gigawatt-hours of renewable generation from power stations. This was subsequently reduced to 33,000 gigawatt-hours by the Abbott Government with the agreement of the Labor opposition. Alongside this there is the Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme, an uncapped scheme to support rooftop solar power and solar hot water and several State schemes providing feed-in tariffs to encourage photovoltaics. In 2012, these policies were supplemented by a <b>carbon</b> <b>price</b> and a 10billion-dollar fund to finance renewable energy projects, although these initiatives were later withdrawn by the Federal Government.|$|E

However, the report noted {{that there was little}} difference in costs between the government paying all and the ETS with free allocation, as all the model results indicated small reductions (-0.1% and -0.4%) in Gross National Disposable Income compared to ‘business as usual’.|$|E
500|$|In the 2010 {{election}} campaign, Gillard {{pledged to}} build a [...] "national consensus" [...] for a <b>carbon</b> <b>price</b> by creating a [...] "citizens assembly", to examine [...] "the evidence on climate change, the case for action and the possible consequences of introducing a market-based approach to limiting and reducing carbon emissions", {{over the course of}} one year. The assembly was to be selected by an independent authority who would select people from the electoral roll using census data. The plan was never implemented. After the 2010 Election, Gillard agreed to form a minority government with the Greens and Independents and replaced her [...] "citizens assembly" [...] plan with a climate change panel consisting of Labor, Greens and independent members of the Australian parliament. The panel ultimately announced backing for a temporary carbon tax, leading up to an Emissions Trading Scheme.|$|E
