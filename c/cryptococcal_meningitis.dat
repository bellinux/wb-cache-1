40|$|Multiple factors {{influence}} {{the outcome of}} fungal infection of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). The host and the pathogen in concert with drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier and drug activity are key factors in outcome. Drug costs can be prohibitively expensive. Drug toxicity with standard antifungal agents such as amphotericin B (infusion rate toxicity) can be reduced using simple techniques such as slower infusion and appropriate saline loading. Continuous infusion can allow relatively large doses of amphotericin B (up to 2 mg/kg/day, remaining below 0. 08 mg/kg/hour) to be given with toxicity profiles comparable to expensive lipid formulations of amphotericin B. Dedicated peripherally inserted central catheters can remain in situ for weeks to months and are safe and relatively inexpensive. Correction of metabolic pathology in the case of mucormycosis and resolution of neutropenia are essential to effective treatment of filamentous fungal infections such as Mucor, Aspergillus and Scedosporium. The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the current major antifungal agents used to treat fungal infections of the CNS are reviewed. Tables that provide information about achievable CNS drug levels, antifungal susceptibilities and the likelihood of intrinsic drug resistance of significant fungal pathogens have been included to help the clinician with therapy.

Knowledge of aetiology and laboratory findings in patients presenting with meningitis are important in guiding management. We performed a retrospective study to determine these findings in a setting of high HIV and TB prevalence in Cape Town. Methods Patients undergoing lumbar punctures between 1 st January 2006 and 31 st December 2008 at a public sector referral hospital were studied. Cases were classified by microbiological diagnosis, or in the absence of definitive microbiology as 1) normal CSF (neutrophils ≤ 1 × 10 6 /L, lymphocytes ≤ 5 × 10 6 /L, protein ≤ 0. 5 g/dL, glucose ≥ 1. 5 mmol/L), 2) minor abnormalities (neutrophils 2 - 5, lymphocytes 6 - 20, protein 0. 51 - 1. 0, glucose 1. 0 - 1. 49) or 3) markedly abnormal (neutrophils> 5, lymphocytes> 20, protein> 1. 0, glucose Results 5578 LPs were performed on 4549 patients, representing 4961 clinical episodes. Of these, 2293 had normal CSF and 931 had minor abnormalities and no aetiology identified. Of the remaining 1737, microbiological diagnoses were obtained in 820 (47 %).

50|$|The {{mechanism}} behind IRIS in <b>cryptococcal</b> <b>meningitis</b> {{is primarily}} immunologic.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of risk factors for fungal meningitis, {{including}} the use of immunosuppressants (such as after organ transplantation), HIV/AIDS, and the loss of immunity associated with aging.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bacteriological {{confirmation}} of tuberculous (TB) meningitis is difficult. Culture {{is slow and}} microscopy has insufficient sensitivity. We evaluated real time PCR targeting insertion sequence IS 6110 among 230 consecutive adult patients with subacute meningitis in a referral hospital in Indonesia. METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were examined using microscopy, solid and liquid culture, and real time IS 6110 -PCR with a fluorescence-labeled probe using DNA extracted from CSF. CSF samples from 40 non-infectious neurology patients were used as negative controls. IS 6110 -PCR results were linked with clinical and CSF characteristics. RESULTS: Most patients presented with subacute meningitis, after a median of 14 days of symptoms (range 7 - 30). After exclusion of <b>cryptococcal</b> and bacterial <b>meningitis,</b> 207 patients were classified as definite or probable TB meningitis; 17. 9 % with HIV infection. Among this group IS 6110 -PCR gave the highest positivity rate (68 %, 95 % CI 62 - 74 %) compared with microscopy of ZN-stained slides (11 %, 95 % CI 7 - 15 %), and mycobacterial culture using solid (36 %, 95 % CI 29 - 42 %) and liquid (44 %, 95 % CI 37 - 51 %) media. IS 6110 -PCR was positive in 92 % of patients with culture-positive and 42 % of patients with culture-negative probable TB meningitis. Among culture-negative patients, a positive PCR {{was associated with a}} history of TB treatment, a longer duration of illness, a higher CSF cell count and protein, and a lower CSF glucose. IS 6110 -PCR was negative in all CSF samples from non-meningitis control patients.

Its performance in other (less-developed) settings needs further study...|$|R
40|$|Antiretroviral therapy (ART) {{initiation}} in HIV-infected patients {{leads to}} recovery of CD 4 +T cell numbers and restoration of protective immune responses against {{a wide variety}} of pathogens, resulting in reduction in the frequency of opportunistic infections and prolonged survival. However, in a subset of patients, dysregulated immune response after initiation of ART leads to the phenomenon of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The hallmark of the syndrome is paradoxical worsening of an existing infection or disease process or appearance of a new infection/disease process soon after initiation of therapy. The overall incidence of IRIS is unknown, but is dependent on the population studied and the burden of underlying opportunistic infections. The immunopathogenesis of the syndrome is unclear and appears to be result of unbalanced reconstitution of effector and regulatory T-cells, leading to exuberant inflammatory response in patients receiving ART. Biomarkers, including interferon-γ (INF-γ), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP) and inter leukin (IL) - 2, 6 and 7, are subject of intense investigation at present. The commonest forms of IRIS are associated with mycobacterial infections, fungi and herpes viruses. Majority of patients with IRIS have a self-limiting disease course. ART is usually continued and treatment for the associated condition optimized. The overall mortality associated with IRIS is low; however, patients with central nervous system involvement with raised intracranial pressures in <b>cryptococcal</b> and tubercular <b>meningitis,</b> and respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have poor prognosis and require aggressive management including corticosteroids. Paradigm shifts in management of HIV with earlier initiation of ART is expected to decrease the burden of IRIS in developed countries; however, with enhanced rollout of ART in recent years and the enormous burden of opportunistic infections in developing countries like India, IRIS is likely to remain an area of major concern...|$|R
