40|$|This paper {{examines}} the nonfarm employment choice of individuals using panel data from Ethiopia {{that covers the}} period 1994 - 2004. Non-farm activities that require more resources {{in the form of}} skill or <b>capital</b> <b>yield</b> higher returns but employ proportionately fewer people. Women have lower participation rate than men, and those women who participate are often engaged in low-return activities. The econometric results suggest that the factors that influence individuals’ decision to participate in non-farm employment differ for the different types of activities. Determinants of participation in high-return activities are dominated by capacity variables. Determinants of participation in low-return activities are dominated by push factors. Education is the only factor that has the same (positive) impact on the likelihood of participation in all types on non-farm employment. Education was also found to have more impact on participation of women. ...|$|E
40|$|Firms employ land, capital, and labour {{to produce}} a {{homogeneous}} commodity which is used for consumption and investment. Government levies a tax at a flat rate and spends the proceeds on public consumption and public investment. Factor income and capital gains on land, diminished by taxation, form disposable income. Households save a fixed share of disposable income. Savings, in turn, serve to finance both private investment and capital gains on land. This {{gives rise to a}} portfolio made up of two assets: land and capital. Land income consists of land rents and capital gains, whereas capital income consists of interest payments. In equilibrium, land and <b>capital</b> <b>yield</b> the same rate of return after tax. Under the restrictive income tax (excluding capital gains), a tax increase generally raises the land price. Under the comprehensive income tax (including capital gains), a tax increase has no bearing on the land price. Under special land taxes, however, a tax increase lowers the land price. ...|$|E

The yields of an industrial capital {{can be used as}} a discount factor in determination of the value of a firm by discounted cash flow methods. Following the neoclassical assumptions we know that firms are optimising their behaviour and hence they relate the desired capital stock to interest rates and employment to wage in the way of equalization of marginal products of capital and labour to interest rate and wage respectively. A methodology of measuring capital yields by the help of a production function of a sector proposed here follows from the mentioned neoclassical assumptions.

40|$|How {{intensely}} {{should a}} forest be grown? This {{is a fundamental}} question {{in the process of}} formulating policy guidelines for the management of a forest area, both at the individual property level {{as well as at the}} national level. The question is related to a number of factors; the objective(s) of the forest owner, the productivity of the forestland, the initial growing stock, the accessibility within the forest, assumptions regarding future prices and costs and the required real rate of return. This paper presents an applied analysis with the objective of mapping possible future paths for the growing stock on, and timber harvest from the productive forest area in Norway. The analysis is deterministic. The regeneration strategy is a key factor for the long run development of a forest and is thus given particular attention. The analysis is restricted to deal with timber production only and maximisation of the net present value of the forest area is used as the objective function. The required real rate of return is varied and used as the driving force to fi nd the best (optimal) level of intensity in silvicultural management and thus optimal paths for harvesting and growing stocks.

40|$|Any {{preferential}} treatment of income of certain population groups at setting their share on state costs results in harmful disproportions in consequence. Valid taxing conditions of traders and self-employed persons {{for the last}} three years in the Czech Republic, lead to labour market distor- tions. This paper gives evidence of extreme differences in tax burden of various income groups of self-employed persons compared to wage and <b>capital</b> <b>yield</b> taxation. Remarkable disparities are apparent both at lower and medium-high incomes and at peak incomes exceeding CZK 10 million per year. Presented calculations and figures confirm that particularly freelance occupations, consulting services as well as other trading professions are groundlessly favoured. Their bearers can tran- smit real costs on their clients and yet they are eligible to apply lump sum expenses ranging from 40 % to 60 % of income. Thus, they reduce their taxable income as well as basis of assessment for obligatory payments into insurance system in this way. Unlike them, some traders and people in position of employees cannot use such an optimization from practical reasons. This systemic distortion constitutes a groundless differentiation in a share of different citizens on financing of state expenditures. In a broader sense, it might even contradict constitutional order of the Czech Republic. At least, this situation harms significantly a willingness of citizens to take a share in solidarity system of financing state operation and its social system voluntarily. Diverse tax burden imposes a pressure on the labour market or more precisely leads to crow- ding-out of wage earners out of the labour market into the sphere of so called „švarzsystem” (evasion of labour law provisions by a conclusion of a commercial-contractual relationship).

DESIGN / METHODOLOGY / APPROACH : The authors begin with testing the robustness of generalized trust variable in explaining the effect of social capital on growth and property rights. The authors then propose a number of trust-alternative variables that are shown to contain an element of trust based on theoretical arguments drawn from previous studies, to proxy for social capital and re-estimate its effect on growth and property rights. In this study, the authors use panel estimation technique, hitherto has been limited in social capital studies, which are capable of reducing omitted variable bias and time-invariant heterogeneity compared to the commonly used cross-sectional estimation. FINDINGS : First, the authors find that generalized trust data obtained by the World Value Survey (WVS) are unable to yield sufficiently robust results in panel estimation due to missing observations problem. Using the proposed trust-alternative variables, the estimation results improve significantly and the authors are able to show that social capital is a deep determinant of growth and it is affecting growth via property rights channel. The findings also give supporting evidence to the primacy of informal rules and constraints as proposed by North (2005) over the political prominence theory by Acemoglu et al. (2005).

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses reveal SCBS’s multi-dimensional structure, consistent with Putnam’s (2000) dimensions of “bridging ” and “bonding. ” Regression of regional growth on these dimensions supports the validity of these dimensions. With respect to indices of regional growth, bridging social <b>capital</b> <b>yields</b> positive relationships while bonding social capital produces negative relationships.
