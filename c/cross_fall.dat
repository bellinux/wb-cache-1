6000|$|Now, {{there are}} two kinds of harmonies of lines. One in which, moving more or less side by side, they variously, but evidently with consent, retire from or {{approach}} each other, intersect or oppose each other: currents of melody in music, for different voices, thus approach and <b>cross,</b> <b>fall</b> and rise, in harmony; so the waves of the sea, as they approach the shore, flow into one another or cross, but with a great unity through all; and so various lines of composition often flow harmoniously through and across each other in a picture. But the most simple and perfect connexion of lines is by radiation; that is, by their all springing from one point, or closing towards it: and this harmony is often, in Nature almost always, united with the other; as the boughs of trees, though they intersect and play amongst each other irregularly, indicate by their general tendency their origin from one root. An essential part of the beauty of all vegetable form is in this radiation: it is seen most simply in a single flower or leaf, as in a convolvulus bell, or chestnut leaf; but more beautifully in the complicated arrangements of the large boughs and sprays. For a leaf is only a flat piece of radiation; but the tree throws its branches on all sides, and even in every profile view of it, which presents a radiation more or less correspondent to that of its leaves, it is more beautiful, because varied by the freedom of the separate branches. I believe it has been ascertained that, in all trees, the angle at which, in their leaves, the lateral ribs are set on their central rib is approximately the same at which the branches leave the great stem; and thus each section of the tree would present a kind of magnified view of its own leaf, were it not for the interfering force of gravity on the masses of foliage. This force in proportion to their age, and the lateral leverage upon them, bears them downwards at the extremities, so that, as before noticed, the lower the bough grows on the stem, the more it droops (Fig. 17, p. 295.); besides this, nearly all beautiful trees have a tendency to divide into two or more principal masses, which give a prettier and more complicated symmetry than if one stem ran all the way up the centre. Fig. 41. may thus be considered the simplest type of tree radiation, as opposed to leaf radiation. In this figure, however, all secondary ramification is unrepresented, for the sake of simplicity; but if we take one half of such a tree, and merely give two secondary branches to each main branch (as represented in the general branch structure shown at b, Fig. 18., p. 296), we shall have the form, Fig. 42. This I consider the perfect general type of tree structure; and it is curiously connected with certain forms of Greek, Byzantine, and Gothic ornamentation, into the discussion of which, however, we must not enter here. It will be observed, that both in Figs. 41. and 42. all the branches so spring from the main stem as very nearly to suggest their united radiation from the root R. This is by no means universally the case; but if the branches do not bend towards a point in the root, they at least converge to some point or other. In the examples in Fig. 43., the mathematical centre of curvature, a, is thus, in one case, on the ground at some distance from the root, and in the other, near the top of the tree. Half, only, of each tree is given, for the sake of clearness: Fig. 44. gives both sides of another example, in which the origins of curvature are below the root. As the positions of such points may be varied without end, and as the arrangement of the lines is also farther complicated by the fact of the boughs springing for the most part in a spiral order round the tree, and at proportionate distances, the systems of curvature which regulate the form of vegetation are quite infinite. Infinite is a word easily said, and easily written, and people do not always mean it when they say it; in this case I do mean it; the number of systems is incalculable, and even to furnish any thing like a representative number of types, I should have to give several hundreds of figures such as Fig. 44.[251] ...|$|E

50|$|The cant of {{a railway}} track or camber {{of a road}} (also {{referred}} to as superelevation, cross slope or <b>cross</b> <b>fall)</b> is {{the rate of change}} in elevation (height) between the two rails or edges. This is normally greater where the railway or road is curved; raising the outer rail or {{the outer edge of the}} road providing a banked turn, thus allowing vehicles to maneuver through the curve at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible if the surface were flat or level.|$|E
50|$|Cross slope, <b>cross</b> <b>fall</b> or camber is a {{geometric}} {{feature of}} pavement surfaces: the transverse slope {{with respect to}} the horizon. It is a very important safety factor. Cross slope is provided to provide a drainage gradient so that water will run off the surface to a drainage system such as a street gutter or ditch. Inadequate cross slope will contribute to aquaplaning. On straight sections of normal two-lane roads, the pavement cross section is usually highest in the center and drains to both sides. In horizontal curves, the cross slope is banked into superelevation to reduce steering effort and lateral force required to go around the curve. All water drains {{to the inside of the}} curve. If the cross slope magnitude oscillates within 1 - 25 m, the body and payload of high (heavy) vehicles will experience high roll vibration.|$|E

The purpose of the analysis was to determine the repeatabilities, reproducibilities, and accuracies of the measurements. Application of the International Organization for Standardization 5725 standard resulted in the detection of a significant proportion of outlying results with most if not all devices. After removal of the outliers, average standard deviations (SDs) for repeatability were typically 0. 1 percent for <b>cross</b> <b>fall,</b> 0. 5 to 0. 9 nun for rut depth, and 0. 25 mm for water depth: cross-fall measurements exhibited an average SD for reproducibility of 0. 5 percent, for rut depth measurements the values were 1. 7 to 2. 7 mm, and for water depth measurements the values were 2. 1 to 2. 2 mm. The overall SD for the accuracies of the profile measurements was found to be 1. 9 mm. The rather wide range of (in) accuracy (0. 8 to 3. 2 mm) among the different test sections is explained by the influence of longitudinal unevenness (international roughness index). Operating speed in the speed range used in the experiment had no significant influence on most measurements obtained. Moreover, speed had no significant influence on the repeatabilities or the reproducibilities of the indices or on profile measurement accuracy. Averaging distance had a significant influence on the SD for repeatability, which decreased by a factor of 2 to 4 when the averaging distance increased from 50 to 500 m. The reproducibilities of the indices did not significantly depend on the averaging distance in any systematic way...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 31 st Annual Southern African Transport Conference 9 - 12 July 2012 "Getting Southern Africa to Work", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. A major airport in Namibia was recently rehabilitated by first milling off a delaminated asphalt layer and inlay with a continuously graded asphalt layer and placing an ultra-thin proprietary surface friction course on top. The asphalt inlay work included a <b>cross</b> <b>fall</b> correction with asphalt wedge build up on the centre line tapering off to the off keel area of the runway. Construction was interrupted for 6 months due to unnaturally high rainfall. This interruption came after the asphalt inlay work was completed and a short section of the surface friction course on the main runway was placed. At resumption of work and prior to completion of the proprietary surface friction course white deposits were observed on the surface. The white deposit tended to concentrate along the longitudinal joints of the previously constructed asphalt. The origin of the white deposit was investigated and could be linked to salt leaching from aggregates in the underlying layers. The delaminated asphalt repair {{has led to a}} heightened awareness of durability problems. Previous problems on this airport were linked to stripping, crescent cracking and delamination of the previous asphalt overlay. The subsequent field and laboratory work enabled a clear linkage with the construction quality control of longitudinal joints in general. Densities, air voids and binder content could be checked against specification tolerances via normal quality control testing. Air and water permeability testing were done as well as wet and dry modified Lottmann tests. Cores were also inspected visually to give indicative values of permeability. This investigation served to emphasise the lack of focus of current specifications used on quality control of longitudinal joint construction and their longer term durability impact. The investigation provided the basis for improved quality control and specifications for longitudinal joints of asphalt paving in future.

Za svaku su kategoriju šumske ceste definirane određene tehničke značajke koje u fazi planiranja treba dobro proučiti i uzeti u obzir, u fazi projektiranja ih treba strogo primjenjivati, a u fazi izgradnje, uz provedbu stručnog nadzora, precizno prenijeti na teren. Neke šumske ceste u Republici Hrvatskoj ne udovoljavaju niti tehničkim značajkama najniže definirane kategorije šumskih cesta, prilaznoj šumskoj cesti. Tehničke značajke takvih šumskih cesta bi, kada je to stručno opravdano, tehnički izvedivo, ekonomski isplativo i okolišno prihvatljivo, zbog sigurnosti odvijanja prometa, smanjenja troškova održavanja i minimiziranja negativnog utjecaja na okoliš, trebalo rekonstrukcijom uskladiti s propisanim tehničkim značajkama. Istraživanja su provedena na sastavnicama primarne šumske prometne infrastrukture g. j. „Belevine“ u sastavu nastavno-pokusnog šumskog objekta Šumarskog fakulteta Sveučilišta u Zagrebu, Zalesina. Sedam makadamskih šumskih cesta, ukupne duljine 7, 031 km, izgrađeno je u razdoblju od 1968. do 1988. godine. Od izgradnje pa do danas, sve se šumske ceste redovito održavaju, a radovi održavanja su prevladavajuće usmjereni na popravak oštećenja kolničke konstrukcije i objekata odvodnje. Na šumskim su cestama, u okviru izrade detaljnog registra primarne šumske prometne infrastrukture, izmjerene odabrane tehničke značajke (širina kolnika, širina bankine, uzdužni nagib nivelete i poprečni nagib kolnika).

Uspoređene su postojeće s propisanim tehničkim značajkama šumskih cesta u Republici Hrvatskoj. Na temelju izrađene studije slučaja za primarnu šumsku prometnu infrastrukturu g. j. „Belevine“, moguće je primjenom istovrsne metodologije rada utvrditi manjkavosti, u smislu nepoštivanja minimalnih propisanih tehničkih značajki, primarne šumske prometne infrastrukture bilo koje gospodarske jedinice gorskog reljefnog područja, te dati preporuke tehnološkog postupka rekonstrukcije. Technical {{features}} of forest {{roads in the}} Republic of Croatia are presented in Technical Conditions for Economic Roads (Šikić et al., 1989). Pentek et al. (2007) gave a proposal of new technical conditions in which the basic criterion of categorization of forest roads is traffic load. According to the Regulations (Anon. 2015), in Annex IV. “Technical conditions of forest roads”, the proposal of improvements to the existing Technical Conditions for Economic Roads is accepted (Šikić et al., 1989) (Table 1). The objectives of the research are: 1. Measurement and analysis of selected technical {{features of}} forest roads and comparison with the current technical conditions in the Republic of Croatia (Šikić et al., 1989; Anon, 2015), 2. Recording and analysis of ground and underground drainage elements; road facilities and assessment of construction material categories and 3) Definition of technological process for reconstruction of forest roads {{in order to achieve}} current technical conditions and optimization of drainage systems (“zero”/optimal state). In the field, in the framework of the establishment of a detailed registry of primary forest traffic infrastructure, for each of the seven forest roads in MU “Belevine”, on each sampling plot of 20. 00 m length, according to a newly developed methodology {{for the establishment of a}} detailed registry of primary forest traffic infrastructure (Papa et al. 2015), were measured/calculated the following selected technical features: pavement width, shoulder width, longitudinal alignment gradient and pavement <b>cross</b> <b>fall</b> slope (Figure 3 and 4). Forest roads “ 587 B 1 001 ”, “ 587 B 1 004 ” and “ 587 B 1 006 ” were, according to the criterion of Šikić et al. (1989), categorized as main forest roads, forest roads “ 587 B 2 002 ”, “ 587 B 2 003 ”and “ 587 B 2 007 ” belong to the category of side forest roads and forest road “ 587 B 3 005 ” is an access forest road (Figure 5). Due to the traffic characteristics on mentioned forest roads, characteristics of MU “Belevine” and of forest stands, it would not be justified to construct forest roads with two lanes; therefore on forest roads „ 587 B 1 001 “, „ 587 B 1 004 “ and „ 587 B 1 006 “ will apply technical specifications that apply to side forest roads, and for other forest road technical characteristics that are valid for the category of access forest roads. As a minimum width of pavement for the category of side forest roads reference value will be 4. 00 m, and for the category of access forest roads 3. 50 m. Side forest road minimum width of shoulders is 0. 75 m and for the access forest road is 0 50 m. Maximum longitudinal alignment gradient for side forest roads is 10 %, and for the access forest roads 12 %. The minimum permitted vertical alignment gradient for all categories of forest roads is 0. 50 %. The minimum value of pavement <b>cross</b> <b>fall</b> slope for side and access macadam forest roads amounts to 3 %, and the maximum permitted value of 6 %. For each component of the primary forest traffic infrastructure in MU “Belevine”, by measuring surfaces, the spatial distribution and the current state of elements of the ground and underground drainage: drainage ditch, culverts, bridges, cross ditches and fords was recorded. The position of all road facilities and other elements of forest roads were recorded. For each sampling plot, according to the schematic representation in Figure 2, the basic components of four transverse sections at a distance of 5. 00 m were recorded. The cross-sections were evaluated according to material categories. In assessing the current state of the elements of ground and underground drainage, road facilities and other elements of forest roads, used methodology developed within the whole methodology of a detailed registry of primary forest traffic infrastructure is shown in Table 2 (Papa et al. 2015). Studies have been conducted on the components of the primary forest traffic infrastructure in MU “Belevine” within the Training and Research Forest Centre Zalesina, Faculty of Forestry, University of Zagreb. Seven macadam forest roads, of the total length 7. 031 kilometers, were built in the period from 1968 to 1988. From construction to the present day, all the forest roads were regularly maintained, and maintenance was predominantly focused on repairing damages of road construction and drainage facilities. Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9 are show the analysis of variance of measured and reference (prescribed) values for each selected technical features of forest roads. For two longest forest roads in MU “Belevine”, “ 587 B 1 001 ” length 2207. 48 m and “ 587 B 1 004 ” length 2046. 62 m, a comparison of selected current technical features to prescribed values of the same features of the Republic of Croatia (Anon, 2015) for each sampling plot (Figure 10 and 11) was done. All the selected technical features of forest roads in MU “Belevine”, to a lesser or greater extent, deviate from the prescribed/reference values. It is interesting to note that all forest roads categorized as side and access (with the necessary technical features of the side forest roads) have a higher mean value of the pavement width than those categorized as main roads (with the necessary technical features of the access forest roads). This is explained by the dynamics of the primary forest opening of the study area. The forest road “ 587 B 1 001 ” and “ 587 B 1 004 ” are the first forest roads built in MU “Belevine”, in time of less developed construction technology, different technical characteristics of forest transport vehicles and during the validity of different technical requirements for forest roads. The smallest permitted vertical alignment gradient is not a problem at any of the sampling plots of the researched forest roads. The maximum longitudinal gradients were recorded only on shorter sections of forest roads and values were slightly higher than allowed, or in the framework of exceptional justified cases which in the technical documentation must be explained in detail (in hilly/mountainous area for side forest roads up to 12 %, and for access forest roads up to 15 %). The reported values for pavement cross-slope values were unsatisfactory on most of the sampling plots. Reconstruction of pavement <b>cross</b> <b>fall</b> slope should lead to optimal state (between 3 and 6 % for the access and side forest macadam roads). The spatial distribution and the existing state of the ground and underground drainage system elements on sampling plots of primary forest traffic infrastructure is shown in Figure 12. Table 3 shows first at the level of individual forest road and then at the level of entire management unit integrated information about ground and underground drainage system elements. There is no forest road on which intervention in the objects of ground and underground drainage system elements (in terms of enabling them to be fully functional) is unnecessary. For the ground drainage system to be optimized, the total of 3520 m classic and 1680 m lined drainage ditches on seven forest roads in MU “Belevine” should be constructed, as well 860 m classic drainage ditches, of which 240 m translated into lined drainage ditches should be repaired. It is necessary to construct 47 new and repair 41 existing cross-ditches. 45 concrete pipe culverts were recorded. With regard to the developed hydrograph conditions close to forest roads, existing climatic and geological features of soil in MU “Belevine”, and with the aim of diminishing/reduce the negative impact of water on forest roads, pipe-culverts, drainage ditches and cross-ditches of the right shape, size, and type should be constructed. The elements of an optimized system of ground and underground drainage, along forest roads as well as and for the entire MU “Belevine” are given in Table 5. Damaged road construction and the proposed method of repairing macadam pavement structure at the level of individual forest roads and for the entire MU “Belevine”, are shown in Table 6. Macadam pavement structure of forest roads is in good condition and does not require any intervention on 4. 01 % of sampling plots. At 23. 98 % of sampling plots, pavement can be repaired with mending method. Most of sampling plots (51. 40 %) show that repair pavement method should be aligning, and for 20. 62 % of sampling plots the most expensive method of pavement repair – material outspreading is necessary. In future studies it is recommended that to the technological process of reconstruction of forest road network in MU “Belevine”, and it is bringing to so-called “zero”/optimized state, analysis of associated costs should be included...|$|E
