It varies roughly between 0.5 and 10, with a typical value around 3. High Qms indicates lower mechanical losses, and low Qms indicates higher losses. The main effect of Qms is on the impedance of the driver, with high Qms drivers displaying a higher impedance peak. One predictor for low Qms is a metallic voice coil former. These act as eddy-current brakes and increase damping, reducing Qms. They must be designed with an electrical break in the cylinder (so no <b>conducting</b> <b>loop).</b> Some speaker manufacturers have placed shorted turns {{at the top and}} bottom of the voice coil to prevent it leaving the gap, but the sharp noise created by this device when the driver is overdriven is alarming and was perceived as a problem by owners.

50|$|Vehicle {{detection}} loops, called inductive-loop traffic detectors, {{can detect}} vehicles passing or {{arriving at a}} certain point, for instance approaching a traffic light or in motorway traffic. An insulated, electrically <b>conducting</b> <b>loop</b> is installed in the pavement. The electronics unit transmits energy into the wire loops at frequencies between 10 kHz to 200 kHz, depending on the model. The inductive-loop system behaves as a tuned electrical circuit in which the loop wire and lead-in cable are the inductive elements. When a vehicle passes over the loop or is stopped within the loop, the vehicle induces eddy currents in the wire loops, which decrease their inductance. The decreased inductance actuates the electronics unit output relay or solid-state optically isolated output, which sends a pulse to the traffic signal controller signifying the passage or presence of a vehicle. Parking structures for automobiles may use inductive loops to track traffic (occupancy) in and out or may be used by access gates or ticketing systems to detect vehicles while others use Parking guidance and information systems. Railways may use an induction loop to detect the passage of trains past a given point, as an electronic treadle.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{wirelessly}} power electrical devices is becoming of greater urgency {{as a component}} of energy conservation and sustainability efforts. Due to health and safety concerns, most wireless power transfer (WPT) schemes utilize very low frequency, quasi-static, magnetic fields; power transfer occurs via magneto-inductive (MI) coupling between <b>conducting</b> <b>loops</b> serving as transmitter and receiver. At the "long range" regime - referring to distances larger than the diameter of the largest loop - WPT efficiency in free space falls off as (1 /d) (6); power loss quickly approaches 100 % and limits practical implementations of WPT to relatively tight distances between power source and device. A "superlens", however, can concentrate the magnetic near fields of a source. Here, we demonstrate the impact of a magnetic metamaterial (MM) superlens on long-range near-field WPT, quantitatively confirming in simulation and measurement at 13 - 16 MHz the conditions under which the superlens can enhance power transfer efficiency compared to the lens-less free-space system...|$|R

Hence the action cannot be generated at the same time with the reaction due to the relativity of simultaneity, thus the total force cannot be null at a given time. The following is a continuation of a previous paper Tuval in which we analyzed the relativistic effects in a system of two current <b>conducting</b> <b>loops.</b> Here the analysis is repeated but one of the loops is replaced by a permanent magnet.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The water {{saturation}} of {{a natural}} snow cover varies, in general, from zero to approxi-mately 20 % of the pore volume, whereby two essentially different types of water geometry- pendu-lar mode and funicular mode- can be observed. The pendular mode covers the low-saturation range (typically S:s; 7 % for old coarse grainded Alpine snow) and {{it is assumed that}} the water component is arranged in isolated menisci or pendular rings around a contact zone between spheroidal ice grains. However, the water rings or menisci are, thennodynamically, in a very critical- may be in an unstable- configuration. As water rings or menisci represent closed electrically <b>conducting</b> <b>loops,</b> they may be responsible for an induced diamagnetic behaviour of snow, especially in the microwave regime; and this offers a way to measure the amount of water stored in this geometrical configuration. From a carefull analysis of the measured dielectric and magnetic penneability in the microwave C to K-bands of moderate wet coarse grained Alpine snow results, that water rings seem only to exist at saturations lower than ~ 8 %. For saturations exceeding this critical value, water rings begin to merge fonning clusters, whereby the number of ring-like geometries decreases in favour of larger but open-ended structures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Electromagnetic coils {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{engineering}} applications. The magnitude of current (and hence magnetic field strength) is inherently frequency-dependent; above the coil’s breakpoint frequency current reduces in proportion to frequency. This effect often limits the high-frequency performance of devices. A magnetically-coupled <b>conducting</b> <b>loop</b> (“shorted-turn”) may produce beneficial effects of reducing the primary coil’s electrical impedance at high frequencies. This shorted turn effect was modelled using linear transfer function analysis and shown to have close agreement to experimental frequency-response measurements. Parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the effect of individual shorted-turn variables on the frequency response of a primary coil. Experimental variation of shorted-turn parameters confirmed the theoretical analysis, with thicker-walled, lower-resistance loops providing a more pronounced modification of primary coil response. These results and analysis provide a framework to design shorted-turns within electrical devices to optimise high-frequency behaviour...|$|E

These birds are significant components of marine food webs and may contribute to compensatory recruitment and dispersal, but remain severely understudied. Here, we use GPS-PTTs, radio-tracking and analysis of stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotopes to investigate the movements and foraging ecology of immature seabirds. Our study focussed on immature northern gannets Morus bassanus aged 2 – 4 attending non-breeding aggregations alongside a large breeding colony. GPS-PTT tracking of five birds revealed that immatures {{have the ability to}} disperse widely during the breeding season, with some individuals potentially prospecting at other colonies. Overall, however, immatures were faithful to the colony of capture. During returns to the focal colony, immatures acted as central place foragers, <b>conducted</b> <b>looping</b> and commuting flights, and analysis of the variance in first-passage time revealed evidence of area-restricted search (ARS) behaviour. In addition, stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotope analyses indicate that immatures were isotopically segregated from breeders.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a magnetic microsystem capable of detecting nucleic acids via the size difference between bare magnetic beads and bead compounds. The bead compounds are formed through linking nonmagnetic beads and magnetic beads by the target nucleic acids. The system comprises a tunnel magneto-resistive (TMR) sensor, a trapping well, and a bead-concentrator. The TMR sensor detects the stray field of magnetic beads inside the trapping well, while the sensor output {{depends on the}} number of beads. The size of the bead compounds is larger than that of bare magnetic beads, and fewer magnetic beads are required to fill the trapping well. The bead-concentrator, in turn, is capable of filling the trap in a controlled fashion and so to shorten the assay time. The bead-concentrator includes <b>conducting</b> <b>loops</b> surrounding the trapping well and a conducting line underneath. The central conducting line serves to attract magnetic beads in the trapping well and provides a magnetic field to magnetize them so to make them detectable by the TMR sensor. This system excels by its simplicity in that the DNA is incubated with magnetic and nonmagnetic beads, and the solution is then applied to the chip and analyzed in a single step. In current experiments, a signal-to-noise ratio of 40. 3  dB was obtained for a solution containing 20. 8  nM of DNA.
