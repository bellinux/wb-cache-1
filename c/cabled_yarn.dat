50|$|A single {{spun yarn}} may be crochet as is, or braided or plied with another. In plying, {{two or more}} yarns are spun together, almost always in the {{opposite}} sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two Z-twist yarns are usually plied with an S-twist. The opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, balanced yarn. Plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing <b>cabled</b> <b>yarns</b> or multi-stranded yarns. Sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé. The single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwords to give the yarn a uniform look.|$|R

25|$|Some {{fiber optic}} cable {{versions}} are reinforced with aramid yarns or glass yarns as intermediary strength member. In commercial terms, usage of the glass yarns are more cost effective while no loss in mechanical durability of the <b>cable.</b> Glass <b>yarns</b> also protect the cable core against rodents and termites.|$|R
2500|$|Yarns {{can be made}} of two, three, four, or more plies, or {{may be used as}} singles without plying. Two-ply yarn {{can also}} be plied from both ends of one long strand of singles using a centre-pull ball, where one end feeds from within a ball of yarn while the other end feeds from the outside. [...] So-called [...] "Andean" [...] plying, in which the single is first wound around one hand in a {{specific}} manner that allows unwinding both ends at once without tangling, is another way to ply smaller amounts of yarn. [...] The name comes from a method used by Andean spinners to manage and splice unevenly matched singles being plied from multiple spindles. [...] "Navajo" [...] (aka [...] "chain-") plying is another method of producing a three-ply yarn, in which one strand of singles is looped around itself {{in a manner similar to}} crochet and the resulting three parallel strands twisted together. This method is often used to keep colours together on singles dyed in sequential colours. <b>Cabled</b> <b>yarns</b> are usually four-ply yarns made by plying two strands of two-ply yarn together in the direction opposite to the plying direction for the two-ply yarns.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} a low-cost image acquisition and processing system, which measures several yarn production characteristics, namely, the fibers twist orientation, the folded yarn twist step, the folded yarn twist orientation, {{and the existence}} of single (nonfolded <b>yarn)</b> or multiple <b>cables</b> (folded <b>yarn).</b> The imaging hardware consists of a USB web camera coupled to an analog microscope and a monochromatic light source. The acquired images are analyzed using custom designed software based on the IMAQ Vision image program from National Instruments. A full description of the developed image processing tool is presented, together with several experimental results. The results obtained are consistent with information deduced from high-resolution images acquired using an electron microscope. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

50|$|Cable needles are {{a special}} case of DPNs, {{although}} they are usually not straight, but dimpled in the middle. Often, they have {{the form of a}} hook. When cabling a knitted piece, a hook is easier to grab and hold the <b>yarn.</b> <b>Cable</b> needles are typically very short (a few inches), and are used to hold stitches temporarily while others are being knitted. Cable patterns are made by permuting the order of stitches; although one or two stitches may be held by hand or knit out of order, cables of three or more generally require a cable needle.|$|R
30|$|Taking in account these findings, a first {{consideration}} {{would be}} that the intersections and some irregular fibers surrounding the main <b>cable</b> of open-end <b>yarn</b> could have promoted the presence of fibrils and microfibrils in the final composite, which probably could increase the good adhesion between matrices and reinforcement. On the other hand, taking into account the previous cited shredding process for textile reinforcement production, {{it is not possible to}} ensure the integrity of the yarns originally present in the fabric inside the final composite. Hence, a most plausible hypothesis is to consider that the majority of fibrils and microfibrils were originated from shredding process for production of the textile reinforcement rather than as a consequence of the structure of the open-end yarn.|$|R
40|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{formation of}} double helices for filaments under torsion is common and significant. For example, {{the research on}} the supercoiling of DNA is helpful for understanding the replication and transcription of DNA. Similar double helices can appear in polymer chains, carbon nanotube <b>yarns,</b> <b>cables,</b> telephone wires and so forth. We noticed that non-uniform double helices can be produced due to the surface friction induced by the self-contact. Therefore an ideal model was presented to investigate the formation of double helices for elastic rods under torque. A general equilibrium condition which is valid for both the smooth surface and the rough surface situations is derived by using the variational method. Based on this, by adding further constraints, the smooth and rough surface situations are investigated in detail respectively. Additionally, the model showed that the specific process of how to twist and slack the rod can determine the surface friction and hence influence {{the configuration of the}} double helix formed by rods with rough surfaces. Based on this principle, a method of manufacturing double helices with designed configurations was proposed and demonstrated. Finally, experiments were performed to verify the model and the results agreed well with the theory. Comment: 31 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
