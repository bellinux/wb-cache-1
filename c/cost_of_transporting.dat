We contrast inter- and intra-individual methods for estimating minimum <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> (MCOT) {{and the relationship}} between speed, contraction frequency and distance traveled per contraction. The minimum <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> calculated from intra-individual data is 2297 ± 317 J kg 2 lm 21 (S. E.

These values are almost ten times higher than the predicted value for a similar-sized limbed arthropod. Fly larvae travel by repeated peristaltic contractions and individual contractions cost about the same amount as individual strides in limbed insects. Both contraction frequency and distance traveled per contraction increase linearly with speed. Doubling the contraction frequency or the distance traveled per contraction approximately doubles speed. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> in fly larvae is among the highest recorded for terrestrial locomotion, confirming the suggestion that biomechanical and kinematic properties of limbless organisms with hydraulic skeletons lead to very high <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport...</b>|$|R
