25|$|On {{the right}} is an {{illustration}} of the electric field vectors of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave. The electric field vectors have a constant magnitude but their direction changes in a rotary manner. Given {{that this is a}} plane wave, each vector represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the axis. Specifically, given that this is a circularly polarized plane wave, these vectors indicate that the electric field, from plane to plane, has a <b>constant</b> <b>strength</b> while its direction steadily rotates. Refer to these two images in the plane wave article to better appreciate this. This light is considered to be right-hand, clockwise circularly polarized if viewed by the receiver. Since this is an electromagnetic wave each electric field vector has a corresponding, but not illustrated, magnetic field vector that is at a right angle to the electric field vector and proportional in magnitude to it. As a result, the magnetic field vectors would trace out a second helix if displayed.|$|E

But Ginevra {{had a kind of}} spirit with her, {{empowered}} to give <b>constant</b> <b>strength</b> and comfort, to gladden daylight and embalm darkness; the best of the good genii that guard humanity curtained her with his wings, and canopied her head with his bending form. By True Love was Ginevra followed: never could she be alone. Was she insensible to this presence? It seemed to me impossible: I could not realize such deadness. I imagined her grateful in secret, loving now with reserve; but purposing one day to show how much she loved: I pictured her faithful hero half conscious of her coy fondness, and comforted by that consciousness: I conceived an electric chord of sympathy between them, a fine chain of mutual understanding, sustaining union through a separation of a hundred leagues--carrying, across mound and hollow, communication by prayer and wish. Ginevra gradually became with me a sort of heroine. One day, perceiving this growing illusion, I said, [...] "I really believe my nerves are getting overstretched: my mind has suffered somewhat too much a malady is growing upon it--what shall I do?

6000|$|In all {{the loveliest}} {{representations}} in central Greek {{art of the}} birth of Athena, Apollo stands close to the sitting Jupiter, singing, with a deep, quiet joyfulness, to his lyre. The sun is always thought of as the master of time and rhythm, and as the origin of the composing and inventive discovery of melody; but the air, as the actual element and substance of the voice, the prolonging and sustaining power of it, and the symbol of its moral passion. Whatever in music is measured and designed belongs therefore to Apollo and the Muses; whatever is impulsive and passionate, to Athena; hence her <b>constant</b> <b>strength</b> a voice or cry (as when she aids the shout of Achilles) curiously opposed to the dumbness of Demeter. The Apolline lyre, therefore, {{is not so much the}} instrument producing sound, as its measurer and divider by length or tension of string into given notes; and I believe it is, in a double connection with its office as a measurer of time or motion and its relation to the transit of the sun in the sky, that Hermes forms it from the tortoise-shell, which is the image of the dappled concave of the cloudy sky. Thenceforward all the limiting or restraining modes of music belong to the Muses; but the more passionate music is wind music, as in the Doric flute. Then, when this inspired music becomes degraded in its passion, it sinks into the pipe of Pan, and the double pipe of Marsyas, and is then rejected by Athena. The myth which represents her doing so is that she invented the double pipe from hearing the hiss of the Gorgonian serpents; but when she played upon it, chancing to see her face reflected in water, she saw that it was distorted, whereupon she threw down the flute which Marsyas found. Then, the strife of Apollo and Marsyas represents the enduring contest between music in which the words and thought lead, and the lyre measures or melodizes them (which Pindar means when he calls his hymns [...] "kings over the lyre"), and music in which the words are lost and the wind or impulse leads,--generally, therefore, between intellectual, and brutal, or meaningless, music. Therefore, when Apollo prevails, he flays Marsyas, taking the limit and external bond of his shape from him, which is death, without touching the mere muscular strength, yet shameful and dreadful in dissolution.|$|E

50|$|There are a {{large number}} of constellations that may satisfy a {{particular}} mission. Usually constellations are designed so that the satellites have similar orbits, eccentricity and inclination so that any perturbations affect each satellite in approximately the same way. In this way, the geometry can be preserved without excessive station-keeping thereby reducing the fuel usage and hence increasing the life of the satellites. Another consideration is that the phasing of each satellite in an orbital plane maintains sufficient separation to avoid collisions or interference at orbit plane intersections. Circular orbits are popular, because then the satellite is at a constant altitude requiring a <b>constant</b> <b>strength</b> signal to communicate.|$|E

50|$|The Squadron was {{initially}} a small force of Royal Navy warships based in Sydney, and although {{intended to protect}} the colonies of Australia and New Zealand, the ships were primarily used for surveying and police work.

Following the passing of the Australasian Defence Act 1887, an additional 'Auxiliary Squadron' was assigned to the Station by the British Admiralty with the responsibility for protecting trade in the region.

5000|$|Whenever {{the speed}} or {{angle of attack}} of an airfoil changes there is a {{corresponding}} amount of vorticity deposited in the wake behind the airfoil, joining the two trailing vortices. This vorticity is a continuum of mini-starting-vortexes. The wake behind an aircraft is a continuous sheet of weak vorticity, between the two trailing vortices, and this accounts for the changes in strength of the trailing vortices as the airspeed of the aircraft and angle of attack on the wing change during flight. (The strength of a vortex cannot change within the fluid except by the dissipative action of viscosity. Vortices either form continuous loops of <b>constant</b> <b>strength,</b> or they terminate at the boundary of the fluid - usually a solid surface such as the ground.) ...|$|E
50|$|To {{understand}} how a balanced modulator works {{it is necessary to}} understand amplitude modulation and how it works. Most people describe amplitude modulation as a method of changing the strength of the carrier (amplitude) in sync with the modulating audio. This is true, the power output does change with modulation, but it changes because any AM modulator generates two sidebands, one above and one below the carrier. As power goes into these sidebands, the power output increases. The amplitude modulated signal, then, consists of a <b>constant</b> <b>strength</b> carrier and two sidebands. The sidebands carry the information and the carrier just goes along for the ride. The carrier can be removed at the transmitter and reinserted at the receiver to allow the transmitter to put all the power in the sidebands.|$|E
