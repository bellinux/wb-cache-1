Economic rent and <b>consumer</b> <b>surplus</b> were compared by using a common mathematical model and empirical observation. The concepts of economic rent and <b>consumer</b> <b>surplus</b> were assumed to be consistent methods of resource valuation and that the models would yield equivalent values.
