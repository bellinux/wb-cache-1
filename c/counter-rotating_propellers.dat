5|$|Coandă was {{interested}} in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905, conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the Romanian Army arsenal in Bucharest. In secret, at Spandau in Germany, Coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller, and two <b>counter-rotating</b> <b>propellers</b> providing lift, powered by a 50-horsepower (37kW) Antoinette engine. Positioned along the fuselage centreline, the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically, while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17degrees. According to later claims, Coandă tested the aircraft at Cassel, witnessed by the Chancellor of the German Empire Bernhard von Bülow. It was around this time that Coandă's interest in jet propulsion began, claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in December 1907 at the Sporthalle indoor sports arena in Berlin.|$|E

50|$|During the 1950s the US Navy ordered {{development}} {{of a new generation of}} lightweight anti-submarine torpedoes. Two programs were started, the EX-2A at the Naval Ordnance Test Station Pasadena (NOTS-Pasadena) and the EX-2B at General Electric Ordnance Department, Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The EX-2A was to have its <b>counter-rotating</b> <b>propeller</b> driven directly by an electric motor, while the EX-2B was to use a gas turbine connected to a gearbox.|$|R
25|$|A {{design feature}} of the Peregrine {{was that it was}} {{produced}} in both right- and left-hand tractor variants. This was done to improve aircraft handling by providing a <b>counter-rotating</b> <b>propeller</b> facility. This was a common feature of German designs, but relatively rare on UK engines. The handing of internal parts to achieve this was a considerable complication that was later abandoned in favour of an idler gear arrangement for the Merlin propeller reduction gear.|$|R
25|$|A second {{experiment}} {{conducted during}} a trip to Paris involved a propeller-driven bicycle designed by Bossi. The test rider achieved a speed of 23 miles (37km) per hour, but one drawback was noted: the gyroscopic effect of the propeller generated so much torque that the bicycle became unstable. Bossi concluded, erroneously, that a successful human-powered aircraft would therefore require two <b>counter-rotating</b> <b>propellers</b> to cancel out the effects of torque – similar to the design of a helicopter. In light of these findings, Bossi decided to design an aircraft incorporating this difficult requirement.|$|E
25|$|The {{propellers}} {{envisioned for}} the completed fighter — unlike the torque-reducing <b>counter-rotating</b> <b>propellers</b> of the V-173 design — {{were to have}} a built-in cyclic movement like a helicopter's main rotor, with a very limited ability to shift their center of lift up and down to aid the aircraft in maneuvering. An ejection seat was fitted to allow the pilot to clear the massive propellers {{in the event of}} an in-flight emergency. Although the prototype was unarmed, a combination of machine guns and cannons would have been installed under the nose.|$|E

2500|$|Power {{came from}} four Daimler-Benz DB 601 engines, coupled {{together}} in pairs in a [...] "power system" [...] {{known as the}} DB 606, weighing 1.5 metric tonnes apiece. [...] The DB 606 [...] "power systems" [...] were originally developed for both the single-"engined" [...] Heinkel He 119 high-speed reconnaissance aircraft, and the Heinkel He 177 strategic bomber, but the Me 261's design housed the DB 606 [...] "power systems" [...] in nacelles that afforded significantly better access for maintenance and ventilation for the [...] "twinned" [...] DB 601 component engines in each one, than the Heinkel heavy bomber possessed.

40|$|Economic {{factors and}} {{environmental}} awareness {{is driving the}} evolution of aircraft engines towards increasingly higher efficiencies, reaching for lower fuel consumption and lower emissions. The Counter-Rotating Open Rotor (CROR) is actively being researched around the world, promising a significantly increased propulsion efficiency relative to existing turbofans by employing two, <b>counter-rotating</b> <b>propeller</b> blade rows, thereby increasing the bypass ratio of the engine. Historically, these engines have been plagued by very high noise levels, mainly due to the impingement of the front rotor tip vortices on the rear rotor. In modern designs, the noise levels have been significantly decreased by clipping the rear, <b>counter-rotating</b> <b>propeller.</b> Unfortunately, this comes {{at a cost of}} decreased efficiency. An alternative, potential solution lies with the Boxprop, which was invented by Richard Avellán and Anders Lundbladh. The Boxprop consist of blade pairs joined at the tip, and are conceptually similar to box wings. It is hypothesized that the Boxprop can eliminate the tip vortex found in conventional blades, consequently increasing the efficiency of the blades, and reducing their acoustic signature. The present work highlights advances done in the research surrounding the Boxprop. A validation of the deployed CFD methodology is presented, in which numerical and experimental results compare favourably. Performance results for a Boxprop (GP-X- 701) designed for cruise conditions are presented and compared with a generic conventional propeller (GP-S- 609). It is shown that the present Boxprop cruise design can reach the required thrust for replacing the front rotor of a modern CROR, but with increased swirl relative to the analyzed conventional propeller. This is mainly due to the effect of the blade passage unloading one of the Boxprop blade halves near the tip, forcing the blade to be more highly loaded closer to the hub. The swirl generated by the Boxprop could be partially recovered if it is used together with a rear <b>counter-rotating</b> <b>propeller.</b> A Wake Analysis Method (WAM) is presented in this work and is used to quantify the power flows inherent to the flow features of the propeller wake. The power flows can be characterized as propulsively beneficial, recoverable, or pure losses. It has the ability to distinguish the kinetic energies of the tip vortices, wakes, and other disturbances from the flow field. The Wake Analysis Method was applied on the two propellers mentioned earlier, and confirmed that the Boxprop produces 50 % more swirl than the conventional propeller. Additionally, the method very clearly shows the lack of tip vortex on the Boxprop, and the presence of it in the flow field of the conventional propeller...|$|R

The number of configurations available for the CRP system is limitless, thus only a small portion of the number of possible cases were examined. Measurements were made upstream, in between and downstream of the propeller system. The abundance of data readily available from the LDV system clearly identifies the tip vortices and wake regions. The recovery by the downstream propeller of the swirl velocity imparted to the flow by the upstream propeller is very evident. The coefficients of thrust and power were determined using momentum and energy analysis of the data and compared to theory...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{issue with}} the P-38 arose from its unique design feature of {{outwardly}} rotating (at the [...] "tops" [...] of the propeller arcs) <b>counter-rotating</b> <b>propellers.</b> Losing one of two engines in any twin-engine non-centerline thrust aircraft on takeoff creates sudden drag, yawing the nose toward the dead engine and rolling the wingtip {{down on the side}} of the dead engine. Normal training in flying twin-engine aircraft when losing an engine on takeoff is to push the remaining engine to full throttle to maintain airspeed; if a pilot did that in the P-38, regardless of which engine had failed, the resulting engine torque and p-factor force produced a sudden uncontrollable yawing roll, and the aircraft would flip over and hit the ground. Eventually, procedures were taught to allow a pilot to deal with the situation by reducing power on the running engine, feathering the prop on the failed engine, and then increasing power gradually until the aircraft was in stable flight. Single-engine takeoffs were possible, though not with a full fuel and ammunition load. This same design feature was present from its earliest days on both the Luftwaffe twin-engine Henschel Hs 129 ground-attack aircraft, and from the fourth prototype onwards of the otherwise troubled Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber.|$|E

40|$|Noise {{regulations}} for aircrafts that fly over populated areas are continuously becoming stricter. This {{in combination with}} increasing computational capabilities has boosted interest in aeroacoustic computations in the aerospace industry.

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{developed}} for aircraft control {{obtained from the}} propeller forces and moments generated by blade angle variation during a blade revolution. The propeller blade is pitched harmonically one cycle per propeller revolution which results in vehicle control forces and moments, termed cyclic-control. Using a power series respresentation of an arbitrary function of cyclic-blade angle, cyclic-control theory is developed which leads to exact solutions in terms of derivatives of steady-state thrust and power with respect to blade angle. An alternative solution, when the cyclic-blade angle function {{is limited to a}} sinusoidal cycle, is in terms of Bessel functions. An estimate of non-steady azimuth angle change or lag is presented. Cyclic-control analysis applied to the <b>counter-rotating</b> <b>propeller</b> shows that control forces or moments can be uniquely isolated from each other. Thus the dual rotor, in hovering mode, has propulsion without rotor tilt or moments, or, when in propeller mode at the tail of an air ship or submarine, vehicle control with no vehicle movement. Control isolation is also attainable from three or more propellers in-line...|$|R
