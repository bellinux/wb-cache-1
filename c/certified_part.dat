40|$|Metrology is {{fundamentally}} important to every manufacturing sector. The ability to determine manufacturing quality issues rapidly results, in-part, to overall profitability. There {{are a number}} of different quality control methods used, which include coordinate measuring machines (CMM) and conventional dedicated gauging. Conventional hard gauging methods consist of using precision-machined fixtures to verify that parts are within tolerance. This is highly inflexible with the inability to adapt rapidly to changes in part design. Renishaw Plc, a world leading precision engineering company, have developed a method for versatile, automated and thermally stable gauging directly at the manufacturing interface, with the ability to provide full <b>certified</b> <b>part</b> inspection without the need for custom fixturing. This paper illustrates the concept of this new device, Equator, and its ability to significantly enhance the present state-of-the-art manufacturing process chain, when compared to conventional gauges for in process measurement. For verification of this process a modified NAS 979 test part was machined and inspected using the Equator system...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} <b>certifying</b> <b>part</b> of the Zenon Modulo {{automated}} theorem prover, {{which is an}} extension of the Zenon tableau-based first order automated theorem prover to deduction modulo. The theory of deduction modulo {{is an extension of}} predicate calculus, which allows us to rewrite terms as well as propositions, and which is well suited for proof search in axiomatic theories, as it turns axioms into rewrite rules. In addition, deduction modulo allows Zenon Modulo to compress proofs by making computations implicit in proofs. To certify these proofs, we use Dedukti, an external proof checker for the λΠ-calculus modulo, which can deal natively with proofs in deduction modulo. To assess our approach, we rely on some experimental results obtained on the benchmarks provided by the TPTP library. ...|$|R
