5|$|Similar to the United Kingdom's position, {{judicial}} review in Singapore {{is confined to}} matters of public law, and the applicable tests are the source test and nature test. The Datafin decision was applied by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Public Service Commission v. Lai Swee Lin Linda (2001), where the respondent, an employee with the Land Office, had the probationary period of her employment extended without prior warning. Her employment contract was later terminated. She complained to various statutory bodies, and ultimately to the Public Service Commission ("PSC"), but was unsuccessful in having her employment reinstated. She then sought leave from the High Court to apply for {{judicial review}} against the PSC. In the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal accepted that the source test {{is one of the}} tests that can be relied on to determine whether a decision by a body is amenable to judicial review. In addition, it noted that Datafin had held that the source test is not the only applicable test. However, the Court did not embark on a discussion of the nature test because it found that when the respondent's employer had made the decisions concerning her employment, it had acted pursuant to her <b>contractual</b> <b>terms</b> of service and had not exercised its statutory powers. Thus, the decisions were not susceptible to judicial review. It did not invariably follow that when a statutory body makes a decision it is exercising a statutory power.|$|E

25|$|<b>Contractual</b> <b>terms</b> are {{classified}} differently {{depending upon the}} context or jurisdiction. Terms establish conditions precedent. English (but not necessarily non-English) common law distinguishes between important conditions and warranties, with a breach of a condition by one party allowing the other to repudiate and be discharged while a warranty allows for remedies and damages but not complete discharge. Whether or not a term is a condition is determined {{in part by the}} parties' intent.|$|E

Although the objective of fund governance is investor protection, fiduciary duties typically require the board {{to act in the}} best interest of a fund taken as whole and not any particular investor.|$|E

25|$|Many {{contracts}} {{and other forms}} of legally binding agreement include a jurisdiction or arbitration clause specifying the parties' choice of venue for any litigation (called a forum selection clause). Then, choice of law clauses may specify which laws the court or tribunal should apply to each aspect of the dispute. This matches the substantive policy of freedom of contract. Judges have accepted that the principle of party autonomy allows the parties to select the law most appropriate to their transaction. This judicial acceptance of subjective intent excludes the traditional reliance on objective connecting factors; it also harms consumers as vendors often impose one-sided <b>contractual</b> <b>terms</b> selecting a venue far from the buyer's home or workplace.|$|E
25|$|Innes's {{judgments}} {{have had}} a lasting and prodigious impact. Because of his intellectual brilliance and the timing of his tenures – immediately before and after union – {{he was able to}} lay the foundations of the South African common law. He has been praised for defending Roman-Dutch principles against the too-ready invocation of English precedents and ideas. His lucid expositions of legal concepts continue to be regularly cited, a century later, on topics as diverse and fundamental as: the significance of pleadings, the distinction between appeal and review, directors' fiduciary duties, waiver, the grounds for judicial review, determining insolvency, the fair comment defence in defamation law, contractual interpretation, <b>contractual</b> <b>terms</b> contrary to public policy, accession of property, and the appealability of court orders. He is also known for his strong liberal convictions and progressivism.|$|E
50|$|There is a distinction, then, between South African and English law, where {{terms and}} {{conditions}} are synonymous, {{and where they are}} used interchangeably.

25|$|Due {{to a lack}} of flexibilities in European {{copyright}} and database law, {{the mining}} of in-copyright works such as web mining without the permission of the copyright owner is not legal. Where a database is pure data in Europe there is likely to be no copyright, but database rights may exist so data mining becomes subject to regulations by the Database Directive. On the recommendation of the Hargreaves review this led to the UK government to amend its copyright law in 2014 to allow content mining as a limitation and exception. Only the second country in the world to do so after Japan, which introduced an exception in 2009 for data mining. However, due to the restriction of the Copyright Directive, the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by <b>contractual</b> <b>terms</b> and conditions. The European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013, under the title of Licences for Europe. The focus on the solution to this legal issue being licences and not limitations and exceptions led to representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and open access publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.|$|E
500|$|As {{production}} {{on the album}} was underway, Thornton had a falling out with Fanatik J over contract rights. Thornton referred to Fanatik J as [...] "greedy" [...] and stated that [...] "He {{went out of his}} level of producer's ranking.

[...] Fanatik J later engaged in a legal battle with CMH over <b>contractual</b> <b>terms</b> that did not give him input on remixes.|$|E

Lindland, Walbrook and Green began creating material for the album under the billing of One-Watt Sun. Thornton was briefly involved with the project, recording vocals for three tracks: [...] "Trees," [...] "Ants," [...] and [...] "Aliens," [...] based upon rough sonic and lyrical themes created by the production team. After Thornton had a falling out with the label over <b>contractual</b> <b>terms,</b> he gave the label recordings he had made two years previously, consisting of Thornton rapping and goofing off, in order to complete his contract.

They were both taken ill there, and two months of work were lost. By mid-April 1892 the scoring of the first act was complete and by June–July Verdi was considering potential singers for roles in Falstaff. For the title role he wanted Victor Maurel, the baritone who had sung Iago in Otello, but at first the singer sought <b>contractual</b> <b>terms</b> that Verdi found unacceptable: [...] "His demands were so outrageous, exorbitant, [...] incredible that {{there was nothing else to}} do but stop the entire project".

500|$|The {{doctrine}} {{was widely}} seen as unfair, for various reasons - it made no exception for cases where the parties to a contract obviously intended {{for it to be}} enforced by a third party, and it was so inconsistently applied that it provided no solid rule and was therefore [...] "bad" [...] law. The doctrine attracted criticism from figures such as Lord Scarman, Lord Denning, Lord Reid and Arthur Linton Corbin, and as early as 1937 the Law Revision Committee recommended that it should be significantly altered. With the passing of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 on 11 November 1999 the doctrine was significantly altered, and it now allows a third party to enforce the terms of a contract if the third party is specifically authorised to do so by the contract or if the <b>contractual</b> <b>terms</b> [...] "purport to confer a benefit" [...] on such third party.|$|E
