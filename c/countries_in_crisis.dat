5|$|Each of {{the core}} {{economic}} functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake open market operations {{in their efforts to}} realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> <b>crisis,</b> provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.|$|E

Previous meetings took place in Poznań, Poland (1998), Nancy, France (1999), Hambach, Germany (2001) and Nancy, France (2005).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the means, the methods, and the {{techniques}} of public diplomacy that a <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>crisis,</b> such as Greece, should use. The paper addresses the very issues of whether a <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>crisis</b> can conduct public diplomacy and whether it should be recognized as a legitimate and powerful actor in the field. In a broader sense, it focuses on the processes that a country should follow and how a better understanding and framing of its situation, principles, and policy can be provided. A crucial factor for such countries is the choice of communication channels, which includes traditional tools like press releases, letters to editor, editorials, interviews, or more active tools like social media, events, campaigns, and networking. In this paper, three dimensions of public diplomacy are examined, and appropriate tools to be developed in the short, medium and long-term are proposed. The results of the study are based on case studies, methods, and tools employed by Greece during the last years that the country has faced a huge economic crisis. There is a short presentation on the methods that Greece tries to adopt in order to enhance its image worldwide.

Several literati, steeped in Confucianism and Buddhism, sought widening religious horizons, accepting the 'Western Teaching'. Conversion to Christianity was for them the arrival point of a spiritual and personal journey toward religious fulfillment.

40|$|Much of {{the debate}} about the {{management}} of financial crises has focused on structural and psychological issues regarding the conditions that are supposed to be necessary to restore investor confidence.

An analysis of conventional macroeconomic models reveals that countries can afford to run expansionary policies to restore internal balance only if they can afford to ignore the requirements for external balance.

40|$|The recent {{increase}} of interest rate spreads in Europe and their apparent detachment from underlying fundamental variables has generated {{a debate on}} multiple equilibria in the sovereign bond market (see De Grauwe and Ji (2012)).

40|$|We {{develop a}} simple bond pricing model {{to map the}} prices of {{individual}} EME sovereign bonds into term structures of implied (risk-neutral) default probabilities and expected recovery rates. Simple indices of bond spreads {{are found to be}} closely correlated with long-term risk neutral default probabilities, so may provide a straightforward way of monitoring shifts in investors' perceptions. But short-term risk neutral default probabilities behave quite differently, implying that there are periods of market-wide changes in volatility that do not show in measures of average spreads. Estimation of time-varying recovery rates appears to work best for <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> <b>crisis,</b> and suggests that expected recovery falls as the prospect of default becomes imminent. Movements in the median time to default generally appear plausible, both across time and across countries. ...|$|E
5000|$|Other {{less than}} {{comprehensive}} mechanisms {{have been proposed}} but not adopted.

In contrast to FCL provisions, countries drawing on the PCL would be subject to policy conditions. A third proposal, broader and less clearly defined, calls for a global stabilization mechanism whereby the IMF could temporarily use an expanded [...] "tool kit," [...] with instruments including the unilateral offer of FCLs for multiple qualifying countries as well as other special facilities and relaxations of the terms of existing facilities.|$|R
