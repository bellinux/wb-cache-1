5|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} idea of making a game based around trials, which they found to be innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Thomas Bowskill at Nintendo Life said that the game had changed his idea of what <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>for</b> a great game, and called it a masterpiece. Carrie Gouskos at GameSpot said that the game revitalized the {{adventure}} game genre. Michael Cole at Nintendo World Report said that the game's design and interface would make it a good choice for non-gamers as well. Bowskill called the investigation sections tedious and boring at times, but said that they were outweighed by the feeling of accomplishment from solving the cases. Craig Harris at IGN felt that the main issues with the game were its linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because of how the player can stop a witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt that the game was very linear, and that it was unclear how to proceed at certain points. He said that, because of how story-driven it is, the game has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.|$|E

500|$|Hollywood.com writer Eric Sundermann {{enjoyed the}} new {{direction}} Ann's character was taking, {{as well as}} how [...] "Harvest Festival" [...] accurately portrays small-town life. Rick Porter of Zap2it said the episode [...] "put a great cap on the first portion of the season". He called Andy and April [...] "a recipe for excellent comedy" [...] and called the slowly developing romance of Ben and Leslie extremely rewarding. Andy Daglas of ChicagoNow called it a [...] "pure delight from beginning to end" [...] and a good entry point for newcomers to the show. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called the episode [...] "celebration of the whackjobs that live in Pawnee and how their singular focus <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>for</b> some adorably naive comedy". While he praised the main subplot, he said it was too early in April and Andy's relationship for them to declare their love for each other, and said April's declaration [...] "came out of nowhere". Matt Fowler of IGN said it was not his favorite episode, as the jokes about Ben's past felt repetitive compared to past episodes, and the April and Andy subplot [...] "fell a little flat". However, he said it was [...] "chock full of dozens of little moments that make the entire episode worthwhile", and particularly praised the Native American curse and the parody of the media.|$|E
500|$|Santos {{was under}} {{contract}} with Warrior's Boxing Promotions for one year, his contract ended when he abandoned the promotion. On April 26, 2005, Don King Productions {{announced that the}} company had acquired the exclusive rights to promote Santos' fights. At the moment of the announcement Don King stated that: [...] "Daniel is another proud Puerto Rican world champion and I'm excited to have him with me, Junior middleweight is a solid division and there are many fights we <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>for</b> this great champion. Viva Puerto Rico!." [...] Santos said that this event held significance in his life because:"I want to fight all the best fighters and by being with the best promoter, I know I will get those fights and make good money. I look forward to a long and happy relationship with Don King." [...] When interviewed about Santos' signing, Félix Trinidad Sr. said that he was impressed by Santos' performance against Antonio Margarito and said that a fight between him and Félix Trinidad seemed plausible at the moment. On December 3, 2005 Santos was scheduled to defend the light middleweight championship against Sergiy Dzindziruk. In the eight round of the competition Dzinziruk [...] scored a knockdown. The three judges gave the fight a score of 115–112 in favor of Dzinziruk [...] thus making him the new WBO champion.|$|E

2500|$|Jones was {{commissioned}} by the BBC trust to write {{a report on the}} organisation's science reporting, which was published in July 2011. This was broadly supportive of the BBC's accuracy, impartiality and science coverage although it also made a number of suggestions. These included better interaction of staff across the organisation on science topics and in particular an end to [...] "false balance". Jones describes [...] "ttempts to give a place to anyone, however unqualified, who claims interest <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>for</b> false balance: to free publicity to marginal opinions and not to impartiality, but its opposite". The BBC's response to the recommendations was generally positive, several of which it immediately implemented.|$|E
2500|$|Electrostatic {{loudspeakers}} use a {{high voltage}} electric field (rather than a magnetic field) {{to drive a}} thin statically charged membrane. Because they are driven over the entire membrane surface rather than from a small voice coil, they ordinarily provide a more linear and lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers. They also have a relatively narrow dispersion pattern that <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>for</b> precise sound-field positioning. [...] However, their optimum listening area is small {{and they are not}} very efficient speakers. [...] They have the disadvantage that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited because of practical construction limitations—the further apart the stators are positioned, the higher the voltage must be to achieve acceptable efficiency. [...] This increases the tendency for electrical arcs as well as increasing the speaker's attraction of dust particles. Arcing remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when the panels are allowed to collect dust or dirt and are driven with high signal levels.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimate, {{originally}} {{known as}} ultimate frisbee, is a non-contact team sport played by players with a flying disc (frisbee). Ultimate {{was developed in}} 1968 {{by a group of}} students at Columbia High School in Maplewood, NJ. Although ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements, it is unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating, even {{at the highest levels of}} competition.The term frisbee, often used to generically describe all flying discs, is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company, and thus, though still extremely common in casual usage, the sport is not officially called [...] "ultimate frisbee". Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. [...] Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc, and interceptions, incomplete passes, and passes out of bounds are turnovers. Rain, wind, or occasionally other adversities <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>for</b> a testing match with rapid turnovers, heightening the pressure of play.|$|E
