40|$|Since {{transgenic}} cotton {{was first}} grown commercially in India in 1996, the areas cultivated have increased rapidly around the world. Bt cotton {{is produced by}} inserting a synthetic version of a gene from the naturally occurring soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis into cotton. Bt cotton may affect nutrient dynamics in many ways during its life-span {{with regard to the}} temporal-spatial relevance of Bt proteins. Given this, we aimed to evaluate nutrient availability under both Bt and non-Bt systems and varied soil type. The study was conducted dur-ing the 2010 wet season (July to December) in a net-house at the Institute of Agricultural Sciences of Banaras Hindu University. It was carried out on three different soil orders i. e. entisol, inceptisol and alfisol. Bt cotton (cvNCS- 138) and its non-transgenic isoline (cvNCS- 138) were grown until maturity. A no crop pot was maintained with three replications for all the three soil orders. Study design was a fac-torial experiment under a completely randomized block design with three replications. The study concludes that available N was reduced by 12 - 13 % under Bt cotton compared to non-Bt isoline and no <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> whereas it showed a significant increase in available P in the soil under Bt cotton (7. 8 % increase) compared to non-Bt isoline and no <b>crop</b> <b>treatment.</b> Furthermore, it has been observed that avail-able K value varied from 82. 88 kg ha– 1 to 76. 88 kg ha– 1 in the soil under Bt cotton and from 90. 33 kg hato– 1 83. 55 kg ha– 1 in the non-Bt crops and {{a significant increase in the}} Avalaible Zn in the soil under Bt cot-ton compared to non-Bt isoline and no <b>crop</b> <b>treatment...</b>|$|E
40|$|Scanty {{information}} {{is available on the}} impact of diversified cover crops on native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). To study the diversity and phylogenetic structure of AMF communities in multi-species and monospecific organic cover crops in Central Italy, we analysed 54 root systems of host plants from six experimental plots. In the multi-species cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> host plants included Vicia villosa Roth, Trifolium alexandrinum L., Trifolium incarnatum L., Avena sp. and Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth., while only V. villosa was present in the monospecific cover crop. We detected 376 AMF sequences, spanning the regions V 3 and V 4 of the nuclear SSU rRNA gene, using AML 1 and AML 2 primers. Based on 97 % sequence similarity, 15 Glomeromycetes operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found, encompassing seven different AMF genera. Four OTUs, representing 88 % of sequences, were shared among all plant species. They referred to the genera Funneliformis, Claroideoglomus and Acaulospora. Three singletons found in V. villosa, Avena sp. and T. alexandrinum in the multi-species cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment,</b> referred to Glomus, Diversispora and Archaeospora, respectively. Although each plant species hosted a similar number of sequence types either if grown alone, as V. villosa in the monospecific cover (7), or grown together (6 - 10), the total number of OTUs from the monospecific (7) was lower than from the multi-species cover crop (15). AMF community structure in the roots of V. villosa grown either as single cover crop species or together with the other four species, did not show any differences, as revealed by PERMANOVA analysis, which, by contrast, detected a significant difference (P= 0. 035) among AMF communities hosted by plants of multi-species <b>crop</b> <b>treatment.</b> Our data highlight the important role played by cover crop diversity in promoting AMF diversity, which is fundamental for biological soil fertility and the delivery of ecosystem services...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Midwestern United States, {{a region}} that {{produces}} one-third of maize and one-quarter of soybean grain globally, is projected to experience increasing rainfall variability. One approach to mitigate climate impacts is to utilize crop and soil management practices that enhance soil water storage and reduce the risks of flooding as well as drought-induced crop water stress. While some research indicates that a winter cover crop in maize-soybean rotations increases soil water availability, producers continue to be concerned that water use by cover crops will reduce water for a following cash crop. We analyzed continuous in-field soil water measurements from 2008 to 2014 at a Central Iowa research site that has included a winter rye cover crop in a maize-soybean rotation for thirteen years. This period of study included years in the top third of the wettest on record (2008, 2010, 2014) as well as drier years in the bottom third (2012, 2013). We found the cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> to have significantly higher soil water storage at the 0 – 30 cm depth from 2012 to 2014 {{when compared to the}} no cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> and in most years greater soil water content on individual days analyzed during the cash crop growing season. We further found that the cover crop significantly increased the field capacity water content by 10 – 11 % and plant available water by 21 – 22 %. Finally, in 2013 and 2014, we measured maize and soybean biomass every 2 – 3 weeks and did not see treatment differences in crop growth, leaf area or nitrogen uptake. Final crop yields were not statistically different between the cover and no cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> in any of the seven years of this analysis. This research indicates that the long-term use of a winter rye cover crop can improve soil water dynamics without sacrificing cash crop growth in maize-soybean crop rotations in the Midwestern United States...|$|E

However, in humid and sub-humid climates, {{such as that of}} NW Spain, cover crops may be an advantage for controlling vine vegetative growth and improving berry composition, while reducing management costs. The current study was conducted over three consecutive growing seasons (2012 - 2014) to assess the effects of establishing three permanent cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> on water relations, vine physiology, yield and berry composition of a vineyard of the red cultivar ‘Mencía’ (Vitis vinifera L.) located in Leiro, Ourense. Treatments consisted of four different soil management systems: ST, soil tillage; NV, native vegetation; ER, English ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.); and SC, subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.). Midday stem water potential was more negative in the native vegetation treatment, causing significant reductions in leaf stomatal conductance on certain dates. Total vine leaf area and pruning weight was reduced in the cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> {{in the last year of}} the experiment. Yield was unaffected by the presence of a cover crop. No significant differences among treatments were observed for berry composition; however, wines were positively affected by the SC treatment (higher tannin content and colour intensity and lower malic acid concentration when compared with ST). Wines from the cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> were preferred by taste panelists. These results indicate that in humid climates cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> can be useful for reducing vine vegetative growth without compromising yield and berry quality...|$|R

40|$|Aim] The aim was {{to study}} the effects of two {{different}} cover crops (leguminous versus gramineous) on soil NO 3 −-N availability, grapevine N status, and yeast-assimilable N (YAN) and amino acid profile in the must of a cv. Tempranillo vineyard from La Rioja (Spain) over 3 years. [Methods] Three treatments were established: gramineous (barley) and leguminous (Persian clover) cover crops and conventional tillage. Soil total N and extractable NH 4 +-N at bloom, soil NO 3 −-N content from budbreak to postharvest, leaf N content at bloom, and free amino acids and ammonia in must were monitored. [Results] Each year, the barley cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> had lower soil NO 3 −-N than tillage, while the clover treatment showed lower soil NO 3 −-N than tillage in 2009 and showed higher values in 2010 and 2011. In 2011 leaf N content, yeast-assimilable N (YAN), and some amino acids in the grapes were lower in barley cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> thus affecting the amino acid profile. Meanwhile, the clover cover crop did not have these effects. Furthermore, relationships between leaf N content and various amino acids were also found. [Conclusions] With the barley cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment,</b> soil N availability decreased from {{the first year of the}} experiment, provoking a decrease in N grapevine status and in content of YAN and various amino acids at the third year. In contrast, clover cover crop maintained N grapevine status, YAN, and amino acid profile similar to conventional tillage. Therefore, our study shows how soil N can be managed both within a year and from year to year when two different cover crops are sown and how the grapevine N nutritional status and YAN content and amino acid profile can be modified in the must.

40|$|Although most pests of soybeans, Gycine max (L.), in the Northern Great Plains {{are managed}} using pesticides, farm {{management}} practices that encourage biodiversity offer promising long-term, sustainable solutions for controlling insect and weed pests profitably. The recent {{invasion of the}} Northern Great Plains by the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura; Hemiptera: Aphididae) has had potentially important implications for insect communities in soybeans of this region, although recent descriptions of this regional community are scarce. We describe how three pest management systems that vary in the intensity with which they rely on herbicides and insecticides (chemically intensive, reduced chemical, and spring cover crop treatments) affect insect pest populations, arthropod predator communities, weed assemblages, and soybean yield and profitability. Soybean aphids exceeded economic thresholds in all three years, and insecticides successfully suppressed these outbreaks in the two chemical treatments; aphids exceeded the economic injury level in the cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> in two of three study years. Bean leaf beetle (Cerotoma trifurcata Forster; Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) populations were sub-economic in all treatments; insecticides targeting soybean aphid also reduced bean leaf beetles {{in the first year}} of study when beetle populations were at their highest. Foliar-dwelling predator populations were substantially higher in the cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> than in the chemical treatments in all years of study; population declines in the latter treatments were strongly associated with insecticide applications targeting soybean aphids. Foliar predator populations did not rebound within the growing season after insecticides were applied. Soil predator populations were largely unaffected by treatment (except in 2006, when they were more abundant in the cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> than in the chemical treatments). Weed communities varied among treatments and study years, with few consistent trends except that the chemically intensive treatment had lower weed densities than the other treatments. Although input costs of the cover crop and reduced chemical treatments were lower than the chemically intensive treatment, the chemically intensive treatment was the most profitable of the three. Nevertheless, we contend that the cover crops can be managed more efficiently in order to increase the profitability and competitiveness of this treatment while gaining the long-term benefits gleaned from conserving biodiversity in our agroecosystems...|$|E

40|$|Cover {{crops are}} a {{valuable}} management tool to reduce soil and nutrient losses while retaining moisture, improving {{soil organic matter}} content, and stabilizing soil N {{during the winter months}} when the ground is normally left fallow. Cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) is commonly used as a winter cover crop in the Midwest due to its ability to withstand cold temperatures, reduce soil erosion, and scavenge soil N. However, it has been found that a cereal rye cover crop can sometimes reduce performance and yields in the following corn (Zea mays) crop. Past studies have suggested that reduced corn growth and yield are caused by allelopathic effects of cereal rye without considering the possibility that cover crops may be providing soil fungal pathogens with a living host, allowing greater populations to overwinter, and then infecting the following corn crop. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment,</b> cover crop species, planting date, and corn fungicide seed coatings on corn growth, yield, and fungal infection rates through controlled environment and field experiments. In controlled environment experiments, corn following a cereal rye cover crop exhibited greater reductions in radicle length, extended leaf height, and corn shoot dry weight than corn following no cover crop. Additionally, corn following a cereal rye cover crop exhibited greater reductions in radicle length and greater fungal infection rates in roots than corn following hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) or canola (Brassica napus L.) cover crops. The fungicide seed coating did not appear to prevent fungal root infection in corn following a rye cover crop. Field experiments examined the effect of planting date and cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> on corn performance. Corn planted later had greater corn leaf development, extended leaf height, corn shoot dry weight, and radicle length than early planted corn, but had greater fungal infections in the radicle and mesocotyl. The effect of the cereal rye cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> was variable in the field experiments. Corn following a cereal rye cover crop did show reductions in corn development, population, and yields, but these data were often not consistent for both years.

40|$|Primary {{resources}} {{may affect}} the structure of species assemblages in upper trophic levels of food webs. These bottom-up effects may involve important ecological processes that affect pest control. For example, population densities of natural enemies may increase when alternative preys are favoured by a new resource. 2 Ants, particularly Solenopsis geminata Forel (Myrmicinae), are recognized as effective predators of herbivores eggs. In the present study, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} addition of a primary resource in a banana agroecosystem will increase pest control of the banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus Germar (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) by ants. 3 Using stable isotope analyses, we showed that S. geminata used the new resource pathway provided by the addition of a cover crop. This change was revealed by increased ? 13 C values (13 C/ 12 C) in a cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> (C 4 plant) compared with a banana (C 3 plant) in bare soil treatment. 4 We also showed that the abundance of S. geminata, as measured with pitfall traps, was 4. 8 - 5. 4 -fold higher in the cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> than in the bare soil treatment. Estimation of egg predation rates was in the range 7. 8 - 70. 3 %, which occurred in plots with the lowest and highest S. geminata numbers, respectively. 5 The addition of a new primary resource in this system changed the origin of the carbon consumed by predators and increased their densities. The increased ant abundance resulted in increased predation of weevil eggs, which was consistent with our hypothesis. These results will be useful for the design of cropping systems that enhance the biological regulation of pests. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{agriculture}} is a system-scale method of managing on-farm fertility, environmental impact and disease and pest control. Farmers depend on organic amendments, such as compost and cover crops, {{to supply the}} nitrogen necessary to grow cash crops. No-till {{agriculture is}} also used {{as a way of}} improving soil physical structure and decreasing fuel inputs into farm management. Both cover crops and no-till can lead to insufficient nitrogen and nitrogen immobilization if improperly managed, especially during the period of transition into organic production. Two experiments were performed to study the effect of cover crops and no-till on a field transitioning to organic production and a field in its first years of organic production in west-central Indiana. The effects of a leguminous cover crop on soil physical properties and cash crop yield were examined, as well as the timing of nitrogen mineralization following cover crop incorporation and bedding. Greater soil nitrate-N and ammonium-N concentrations were found following the cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> compared to the bare treatment, as well as increased percent nitrogen in the above-ground biomass of the cash crop. There was not a yield increase associated with the increased soil nitrogen, although disease and insect pressure may have obscured the effects. In one of the two years, soil wet aggregate stability following crop harvest was improved in the cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment,</b> despite having been tilled to incorporate the cover crop residues. In a different experiment, the effects of tillage and different cover crops on soil physical properties, nitrogen mineralization and cash crop yield were also investigated. Soil wet aggregate stability and permanganate-oxidizable carbon were increased following cover crop treatments, {{as well as in the}} no-till subtreatment compared to the tilled treatment. Bulk density was not affected by cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> or tillage treatment. The hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) cover crop had the greatest total nitrogen content and also the greatest soil nitrate-N and ammonium-N concentrations following tillage. The tilled subtreatments had greater soil nitrate-N and ammonium-N than the no-till subtreatments throughout the entire experiment, although this may be partially due to the summer-long drought. No yield data were collected for the cash crop due to a late-season hailstorm, but the plants in the no-till plots were smaller and less vigorous than the plants in the tilled plots, possibly due to decreased nitrogen availability in the no-till plots. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of legumes in supplying nitrogen in organic systems as well as the importance of cover crops in the recovery of aggregates post-tillage. Soil wet aggregate stability and permanganate-oxidizable carbon were good indicators of management changes, as differences were registered within a year of establishment. Additional years of research should be performed to monitor the cumulative effects of cover crops and tillage in an organic system. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Extraction of soil zinc with routine {{chemical}} extractants {{does not}} always reflect differences in Zn availability as detected by plant uptake. This study was undertaken to explore and compare {{the use of an}} ion exchange resin and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) for extracting soil Zn as related to plant Zn uptake. Beans were grown in 1989 following differential cropping with corn and beans or fallow in 1988 on a Portneuf silt loam near Kimberly, Idaho. Two Zn fertilizer treatments were imposed across previous <b>cropping</b> <b>treatments.</b> A batch method for determining resin extractable soil Zn was established. Both plant Zn concentration and Zn uptake by beans in 1989 were signifi-cantly higher in Zn fertilized than unfertilized treatments regardless of previous crop; and higher in plots previously cropped with corn than beans or fallow, regardless of Zn treatment. DTPA and resin extractable soil Zn were significantly higher in Zn fertilized plots compared to unfertilized plots but did not differ between previous <b>cropping</b> <b>treatments.</b> Resin and DTPA extractable soil Zn con-centrations were positively correlated. Resin extracted soil Zn correlated better with plant Zn concentration and Zn uptake throughout the growing season than DTPA extracted soil Zn, particularly in plots that had been fallowed or previously cropped with corn. Resin may be extracting labile soil Zn not extracted with DTPA and, therefore, be better simulating plant uptake. Both extraction methods correlated better with Zn uptake when evaluated within <b>cropping</b> <b>treatments,</b> emphasizing the need to consider previous crop when calibrating soil tests...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Cover {{crop residue}} is {{generally}} applied to improve soil quality and crop productivity. Improved understanding of dynamics of soil extractable organic carbon (EOC) and nitrogen (EON) under cover crops {{is useful for}} developing effective agronomic management and nitrogen (N) fertilization strategies. Materials and methods Dynamics of soil extractable inorganic and organic carbon (C) and N pools were investigated under six cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments,</b> which included two legume crops (capello woolly pod vetch and field pea), three non-legume crops (wheat, Saia oat and Indian mustard), and a nil-crop control (CK) in southeastern Australia. Cover crops at anthesis were crimp-rolled onto the soil surface in October 2009. Soil and crop residue samples were taken over the periods October-December (2009) and March-May (2010), respectively, to examine remaining crop residue biomass, soil NH 4 +-N and NO 3 [...] N as well as EOC and EON concentrations using extraction methods of 2 M KCl and hot water. Additionally, soil net N mineralization rates were measured for soil samples collected in May 2010. Results and discussion The CK treatment had the highest soil inorganic N (NH 4 +-N?+?NO 3 [...] N) at the sampling time in December 2009 but decreased greatly with sampling time. The cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> had greater soil EOC and EON concentrations than the CK treatment. However, {{no significant differences in}} soil NH 4 +-N, NO 3 [...] N, EOC, EON, and ratios of EOC to EON were found between the legume and non-legume cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> across the sampling times, which were supported by the similar results of soil net N mineralization rates among the treatments. Stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that soil EOC in the hot water extracts was mainly affected by soil total C (R 2 ?=? 0. 654, P?<? 0. 001), while the crop residue biomass determined soil EON in the hot water extracts (R 2 ?=? 0. 591, P?<? 0. 001). Conclusions The cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> had lower loss of soil inorganic N compared with the CK treatment across the sampling times. The legume and non-legume cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> did not significantly differ in soil EOC and EON pools across the sampling times. In addition, the decomposition of cover crop residues had more influence on soil EON than the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), which indicated less N fertilization under cover crop residues. On the other hand, the decomposition of SOM exerted more influence on soil EOC across the sampling times among the treatments, implying different C and N cycling under cover crops.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been great {{interest}} amongst producers to plant cover crops into corn-soybean (Zea mays L. – Glycine max L. Merr.) rotations. Oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L.) (OSR) and cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) are two cover crops receiving attention due to nitrogen (N) scavenging abilities. This thesis is comprised of two projects, one focusing on OSR {{and the other on}} cereal rye. The objectives of the one-year OSR study were to repeat a study conducted in 2011 - 2012 to determine effects of OSR and OSR bicultures on inorganic soil-N concentrations with time, depth and distance from the OSR drilled row and on corn productivity. Cover crop treatments included a no cover crop control, OSR alone, OSR/oat (Avena sativa L.), and OSR/rye and were established in fall of 2013 at the Purdue Diagnostic Training Center (DTC) in West Lafayette, Indiana (IN). Bulk soil samples were taken in the fall, and detailed samples with depth and distance from the OSR drilled row were taken in spring on four sampling dates. Cover crop aboveground biomass samples were taken in fall and spring. Corn was established after rye termination and the following measures were taken during corn growth: V 6 tissue samples, stalk nitrate, grain N content, plant populations and yields. Cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> affected soil NO 3 -N more than soil NH 4 -N. Soil NO 3 -N was highest near the soil surface, closest to the OSR drilled row and generally decreased with depth. Soil NO 3 -N increased with time, whereas soil NH 4 -N peaked by the third sampling. Corn measurements were not affected by cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment.</b> The Corn-based Cropping Systems Coordinated Agricultural Project (CSCAP) was begun in 2011 with the goal of increasing resiliency of corn-based cropping systems to the stresses of climate variation. The site at the Southeast Purdue Agricultural Center (SEPAC) in Butlerville, IN consists of four treatments: corn no cover, corn with rye, soybean no cover, and soybean with rye. Data from the first four years of this study are presented. Parameters include: rye dry matter and N accumulation, soil NH 4 -N and NO 3 -N concentrations, soil organic carbon and total nitrogen, soil fertility measures, soil aggregate stability, corn grain and stover N and carbon content, corn populations, and cash crop yields. Weather variability impacted cash crop and rye productivity, with decreased yields in 2011 - 2012 due to drought conditions and greater growth and yields in 2013 - 2014. Little rye growth was achieved in fall seasons, but spring growth ranged from 681 - 3102 kg ha- 1 with 22 - 81 kg N ha- 1 in aboveground biomass. Soil NH 4 -N decreased with depth whereas soil NO 3 -N decreased with depth in fall and increased with depth in spring. Soil fertility measures decreased with time at SEPAC regardless of treatment. In 2013, soil aggregate stability in the 0 - 5 cm depth was greater under cereal rye compared to no cover crop. Cash crop yields were unaffected by cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|This two-year study {{investigated}} short-season winter cover crops to improve soil quality {{and growth of}} subsequent vegetable crops in an organic high tunnel production system. Five winter cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> including a nontreated control, Austrian winter peas (Pisum arvense), bell beans (Vicia faba), mustard (Brassica juncea cv. Kodiak), and Daikon radish (Raphanus sativus var. longipinnatus) were grown in a high tunnel in a randomized complete block design from mid-November to mid-March, mowed and incorporated into the soil, and followed by a succession of vegetable crops including tomato (Lycopersicon lycopersicum, cv. ‘Plum Dandy’) and broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica, cv. ‘Bay Meadows’). In 2014 winter peas yielded the greatest above-ground biomass (284 g/m 2), though in 2015 mustard and radish cover crops yielded greater above-ground biomass (424 g/m 2 and 395 g/m 2, respectively). Across both years winter peas contained the highest foliar N concentration (3. 8 %) and resulted in the greatest biomass N contribution, {{at an average of}} 10. 2 g N/m 2. The N contribution from winter pea resulted in a significantly lower soil C:N ratio 30 days after incorporation. Cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> did not result in significant changes to soil quality variables including soil organic matter, pH, and EC, though changes were observed over time across all treatments. The winter pea cover crop resulted in greater tomato leaf chlorophyll estimates than the nontreated control across both years, greater tomato foliar N concentration than all other treatments in 2015, and greater tomato plant biomass compared to the control. Though statistical differences were not detected due to high background variation, the winter pea cover crop resulted in a 48 % increase in mean tomato yield compared to the control. Broccoli plant biomass was significantly greater following winter pea and radish cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> compared to the control (808 g/plant and 726 g/plant, respectively, compared to 600 g/plant), however cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> were not found to significantly affect broccoli harvest variables. Overall findings point to a cumulative effect of cover cropping on soil quality and vegetable crop production in a high tunnel, though the two-year timeline of this project limited the ability to understand long-term effects...|$|R

Treatments included five cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> and three cover <b>crop</b> termination <b>treatments.</b> Termination of cover crops was done with glyphosate, disk-till, and roto-till. Cover crop biomass accumulation was greatest for rye/canola and triticale at Oakes, and hairy vetch and hairy vetch/rye at Carrington. Cover crop and termination affected weed control 14, 29, and 51 days after planting (DAP) at Oakes. Weed control at Carrington was at least 90 % for all cover <b>crop</b> and termination <b>treatments</b> at all three evaluation timings. Marketable yield at Oakes was greater when roto-till was used to terminate the cover crops compared with disk-till or herbicide, which is beneficial for organic systems where herbicides are not used. Marketable yield at Carrington was not affected by cover <b>crop</b> or termination <b>treatments.</b> Results suggest that cover crops can successfully be integrated into irrigated potato production for weed control with yields equal to no cover crop, and with attention to potential mechanical difficulties...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePhotolyses {{of three}} herbicides, bentazon, clopyralid, and triclopyr, were studied on plant leaves after <b>crop</b> <b>treatment.</b> The {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} on cuticular wax films, which are good models for leaf surfaces. The pure compounds and their commercial formulations were investigated under simulated solar light. At the recommended agricultural application rates, the three formulated herbicides photolyzed more rapidly on films than on soil or in water. Their photolysis {{is likely to be}} an important dissipation path from crops after treatment. The effects induced by the adjuvants in formulations were varied. Adjuvants slowed the photodegradation of bentazon slightly. In Garlon, in which triclopyr and clopyralid are combined, the adjuvants did not affect the photolysis of clopyralid even though they accelerated the rate of photolysis of triclopyr by a factor of 7. The kinetics were also affected by the application rates. This work also underscores the importance of assessing the photoreactivity of active ingredients in conditions similar to those of their application...|$|E

These compounds are precursors of biogenic amines, which have negative eﬀects on wine quality and human health. The objectivewastostudywhethertheeﬀectofconventionaltillageandtwocovercrops(barleyandclover) ongrapevinenitrogen status could {{be related to}} wine biogenic amines. Over 4 years, soil NO 3 −-N, nitrogen content in leaf and wine biogenic amine concentrationweredetermined. RESULTS: Barley reduced soil NO 3 −-N availability and clover increased it. In 2011, at bloom, nitrogen content decreased with barley treatment in both blade and petiole. In 2012,nitrogen content in both leaf tissues at bloom was greater with clover than with tillage and barley treatments. Also,total biogenic amines decreased in barley with respect to tillage and clover treatments. There were correlations between some individual and total biogenic amine concentrations with respect to nitrogen content in leaf tissues.

40|$|The {{effects of}} six {{different}} crop species on some {{physical and chemical}} soil quality indicators of a clay soil were compared with a fallow plot. <b>Cropping</b> <b>treatments</b> increased the soil organic matter (OM) content from 2. 28 % for bare soil to 3. 18 % for the bromegrass treatment. Increases in OM content due to different cropping regimes were obtained in the following order: bare soil<crownvetch (CV) <subterranean clover (SC) <alfalfa (AL) <ryegrass (RG) <small burnet (SB) <bromegrass (BR). Increasing organic matter content caused considerable increases in soil structural stability (SSI), porosity (F), infiltration (I), total N and exch. K content and reductions in bulk density (BD), penetration resistance (PR), pH and exch. Na content over the bare soil. Bromegrass (BR) treatment compared with the other treatments showed the highest increases in OM of 39. 5 %, SSI of 9. 68 %, F of 14. 84 % and the largest decrease in BD of - 12. 41 %. Alfalfa treatment over the bare soil showed the highest increases in EC of 124. 60 % and total N of 36. 46 %. All <b>cropping</b> <b>treatments</b> improved the infiltration ratio which had significant positive correlations with F (0. 63 **), SSI (571 **), EC (0. 47 *), OM (0. 47 *) and significant negative correlations with BD (- 0. 63 **), PR (- 0. 75 **) and exchangeable Na (- 0. 53 *). Some other significant correlations among the some soil quality indicators were as follows: F x PR (- 0. 72 **), SSI x PR (- 0. 67 **), OC x K (0. 84 **), pH x EC (- 0. 83 **), OC x total N (0. 78 **), SSI x Na (- 0. 70 **) and OC x PR (- 0. 67 **).

40|$|The {{conservation}} farming systems coupled with stubble retention are now widely adopted in southern Australia to improve soil fertility. However, little {{information is available}} {{about the effects of}} winter crops on soil labile organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools, especially in an arid agricultural ecosystem. In this study, eight winter cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> were used to investigate their effects on soil labile organic C and N pools and microbial metabolic profiles and diversity in temperate Australia. These treatments included two legume crops (capello woolly pod vetch and field pea), four non-legume crops (rye, wheat, Saia oat and Indian mustard), and a mixture of rye and capello woolly pod vetch as well as a nil-crop control. At the crop flowering stage, soil and crop samples were collected from the field and we examined aboveground crop biomass, soil NH 4 +-N, NO 3 [...] N, extractable organic C (EOC) and N (EON) concentrations using methods of 2 M KCl and hot water, microbial biomass, biologically active organic C (CBio), and substrate-induced respiration (SIR) using the MicroResp method. Results showed that the <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> had lower soil moisture content, NO 3 [...] N and the ratios of EOC to EON, but higher pH, NH 4 +-N, EOC, EON, CBio, microbial metabolic diversity index (H) and evenness index compared with the control. There {{were no significant differences in}} microbial biomass C and N among the treatments. Although no pronounced differences in EOC and EON concentrations were found between the legumes and non-legumes, the legume treatments had lower SIR and higher H than the non-legume treatments. Principal component analysis showed that soil microbial metabolic profiles under the crops were different from those of the control, and the <b>crop</b> <b>treatments</b> had a clear separation along principal component 2. In addition, redundancy analysis showed that soil pH and moisture content were the most important influencing factors, along with EON and crop biomass, determining the patterns of microbial metabolic profiles under the crops.

40|$|Current work {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} fuzzy {{reasoning}} system capable of selecting the most appropriate threshold to binarize a sequence of cauliflower crop images. Binary images speed up the processing time to detect the crops and calculate their position. The proposed threshold algorithm is based on a performance criterion, the emergence of a binary image wherein cauliflowers are easily distinguished from the background and no relevant parts of the plants are lost. Once the best threshold is applied and the binary image is obtained, a fuzzy clustering algorithm has been designed to rejoin the fragmented blobs of the plants and recover the cauliflower image. Finally, plant positions are calculated based upon the area and location of the blobs belonging to a plant. This technique is extremely valuable for real time precision agriculture tasks, as are those of selective spraying.

40|$|July 2013. A Dissertation Presented to The Faculty of the Graduate School At the University of Missouri In Partial Fulfillment Of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. Dissertation supervisor: Dr. William J. Wiebold. Vita. If {{producers}} employ corn (Zea mays L.) residue removal {{for ethanol}} production, soil and subsequent corn development characteristics could be affected. Little research has evaluated partial corn residue removal from baling {{followed by the}} use of a cover crop to mitigate potential changes to soil characteristics and corn development. Research is needed {{to determine the effects of}} corn residue removal and establish residue management recommendations for producers to prevent a decline in soil and corn productivity. This three year study evaluated the effects of Baled (60 % residue removal) and Not Baled (0 % residue removal) corn residue treatments in combination with None and Rye (Secale cereal L.) cover crop treatments on 14 soil characteristics and 25 corn development characteristics in a no-till, corn-soybean rotation. The Baled treatment reduced soil magnesium concentrations, increased soil water content at corn silking (R 1) and accumulated more rye biomass than Not Baled treatments. The Rye treatment increased soil ammonium-N concentration, soil water content at R 1, minimum and average soil temperature at corn emergence (VE). Early, median and late emerging corn plants of each residue and cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> were also tracked throughout the growing season to evaluate how emergence order affected 24 plant development characteristics. Significant differences occurred among Early, Median and Late emergence classes for days after planting to VE, days after planting to R 1, length of vegetative development, length of lifecycle, stalk diameter, and corn residue cellulose content. Residue treatment only affected the plant height of emergence classes. Cover <b>crop</b> <b>treatment</b> only affected the length of lifecycle for emergence classes. The results of this study demonstrate that 60 % corn residue removal is feasible in a no-till, corn-soybean rotation causing minimal affects to soil and corn development characteristics. A small amount of biomass was established with rye as a winter cover crop, providing few benefits to soil quality and corn development. Includes bibliographical references...|$|E
