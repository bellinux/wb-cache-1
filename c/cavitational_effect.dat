40|$|On {{the basis}} of study of the {{electrolytic}} polishing of metal pieces, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Utilization of ultrasonically irradiated electrolytes in the electrolytic polishing of copper and steel pieces leads to enhanced polishing quality.

30|$|The {{efficiency}} of ultrasound in {{the processing of}} vegetal materials has been already proved (Vinatoru et al. 1999). The known ultrasounds benefits, such as swelling of vegetal cells and fragmentation due to the <b>cavitational</b> <b>effect</b> associated with the ultrasonic treatment, act by increasing the yield and by shortening of the extraction time. The effect of ultrasound on lignocellulosic biomass has been employed {{in order to improve}} the extractability of hemicelluloses (Ebringerova et al. 2002), cellulose (Pappas et al. 2002), lignin (Sun and Tomkinson 2002) or to get clean cellulosic fiber from used paper (Scott and Gerber 1995) but only few attempts to improve the susceptibility of lignocellulosic materials to biodegradation by using ultrasound have been described. It was found out that ultrasound has a beneficial effect on saccharification processes (Rolz 1986). Sonication has been reported to decrease cellulase requirements by 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 and to increase ethanol production from mixed waste office paper by approximately 20 % (Wood et al. 1997). It was notice that the effect of ultrasound fragmentation of Avicel (microcrystalline cellulose formed by acid treatment) {{is similar to that of}} the enzymes for short incubation intervals (Gama et al. 1997). The time needed for ultrasonic treatment could be reduced when increasing the irradiation power (Imai et al. 2004).|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{treatments}} {{of the dynamics}} of a single bubble in a pressure field have been undertaken for many decades. Although there is still scope for progress, there now exists a solid theoretical basis for the dynamics of a single bubble. This has enabled useful classifications to be established, including the distinction between stable cavitation (where a bubble pulsates for many cycles) and transient cavitation (where the bubble grows extensively over time-scales of the order of the acoustic cycle, and then undergoes an energetic collapse and subsequent rebound and then, potentially, either fragmentation, decaying oscillation or a repeat performance). Departures from sphericity, such as shape and surface oscillations and jetting, have also been characterized. However, in most practical systems involving high-energy cavitation (such as those involving sonochemical, biological and erosive effects), the bubbles do not behave as the isolated entities modelled by this single-bubble theory: the <b>cavitational</b> <b>effect</b> may be dominated by the characteristics of the entire bubble population, which may influence, and be influenced by, the sound field. The well established concepts that have resulted from the single-bubble theory must be reinterpreted {{in the light of the}} bubble population, an appreciation of population mechanisms being necessary to apply our understanding of single-bubble theory to many practical applications of 'power' ultrasound. Even at a most basic level these single-bubble theories describe the response of the bubble to the local sound field at the position of the bubble, and that pressure field will be influenced by the way sound is scattered by neighbouring bubbles. The influence of the bubble population will often go further, a non-uniform sound field creating an inhomogeneous bubble distribution. Such a distribution can scatter, channel and focus ultrasonic beams, can acoustically shield regions of the sample, and elsewhere localize the cavitational activity to discrete 'hot spots'. As a result, portions of the sample may undergo intense sonochemical activity, degassing, erosion, etc., whilst other areas remain relatively unaffected. Techniques exist to control such situations where they are desirable, and to eliminate this localization where a more uniform treatment of the sample is desire...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{potential}} applications of non-thermal technologies, including pulsed electric fields, low frequency ultrasound and high pressure, {{at various stages}} in the production process of protein hydrolysates were investigated. These technologies {{have the potential to}} induce structural changes at a molecular level to protein substrates. The first area investigated was the use of selected non-thermal technologies as pre-treatments for a caseinate substrate prior to enzyme hydrolysis. It has been shown by other authors that pulsed electric field, low frequency ultrasound and high pressure treatments can induce protein denaturation under specific settings and this may increase their susceptibility to subsequent hydrolysis. The pre-treatments of 10 % (w/v) sodium caseinate employed were: pulsed electric field treatment of 34 kV cm- 1 with a total specific energy of 276. 81 kJ kg- 1, low frequency ultrasound at a frequency of 20 kHz (amplitudes of 170 µm and 136 µm) and a high pressure treatment of 400 MPa, each applied for 30 minutes. The results from this investigation indicated that low frequency ultrasound applied for 30 minutes at an amplitude of 136 µm is the most promising pre-treatment as a ~ 33 % reduction in the hydrolysis time was achieved, while all other pre-treatments investigated had, at best, a marginal effect on the hydrolysis rate. Low frequency ultrasound (24 kHz) was also applied during enzymatic hydrolysis of sodium caseinate to investigate if the <b>cavitational</b> <b>effect</b> could lead to increased mixing in the system, thus leading to an enhanced rate of hydrolysis. Amplitudes of 20, 40 and 60 µm were investigated with stirring speeds ranging from 100 - 600 rpm and protein concentrations of 5 - 15 %. It was found that the rate of the hydrolysis could be enhanced by applying ultrasound but only under very specific conditions. For a stirring speed of 400 rpm with a protein concentration of 10 % (w/v), application of ultrasound at amplitudes of 20 µm and 40 µm decreased the hydrolysis time by ~ 25 % and ~ 45 % respectively. All other ultrasound conditions investigated lead to either an increased hydrolysis time or had a marginal effect over the control indicating that there is a narrow optimum range of conditions in which this phenomenon occurs. Finally high pressure was compared to thermal treatments as a means to inactivate enzyme activity (e. g. for the termination of a hydrolysis reaction). The enzyme, Protamex®, was subjected to thermal and high pressure treatments when dispersed in water or in a 10 % (w/v) sodium caseinate substrate solution. The presence of the caseinate substantially increased the stability of the enzyme to heat treatment. Similarly the enzyme was more pressure susceptible in water than in the presence of sodium caseinate, again indicating a protective effect of the substrate. Over 90 % inactivation was achieved at pressures &# 8805; 400 MPa with holding times of 30 minutes in water, whereas this level of inactivation required 600 MPa in the sodium caseinate solution. No significant inactivation occurred at pressures < 400 MPa. During the course of this work it became apparent that these non-thermal technologies only {{have a positive effect on}} hydrolysis under a very narrow range of conditions and careful process optimisation is required. All of the investigations conducted were also at laboratory scale and up-scaling of these experiments may result in different outcomes...|$|E
30|$|A first {{event of}} this kind had been {{observed}} in 2008 and was traced back to vibrations caused by <b>cavitational</b> <b>effects</b> in an HPP valve (Mutschler and Triantafyllidis 2009). It was thought that these vibrations could have reduced the shear strength of the clayey fillings and the critical hydraulic gradient. But as such events repeatedly appeared also seasonal effects were discussed besides dynamic triggers. These seasonal effects {{can be described as}} a cyclic alternation of sedimentation and erosion of the clayey cavity fillings. With rising water level, these deposits become inundated, pressurized by a local hydraulic gradient, and—after a continuous flow path has formed—washed out by retrograde erosion. Cyclic changes of the fillings’ consistency and shear strength may also play a role even, though a complete dryout of the karst is not expected. The understanding is that the occurrence of hydraulic breakthroughs could be triggered either by sudden pressure changes or dynamic events.|$|R

The influence of key factors, including Fe doping amount and power density of dual-frequency ultrasounds (20 / 40 kHz), on the degradation efficiency was investigated.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} a noninvasive field measurement approach linked with FE design techniques to optimise the identification and control of pressure node locations (associated with regions of cavitation) within small liquid filled vessels (e. g. 100 mm diameter, 150 mm height). The measurement technique is based on the interferometric detection of refractive index changes in transparent media due to pressure, coupled with modified tomographic scanning routines, to allow the reconstruction of a three-dimensional map of pressure within cylindrical vessels. Importantly, an adaptive algorithm was developed to control the firing angle of the interferometer in order to compensate for the refractional effects introduced by arbitrary cell structures and hence, maintain the parallel projections essential for reconstruction accuracy. These systems were simulated in the FE domain with good correspondence between the optically measured profiles and theoretical profiles established.

No differences were found for pelleted RT 4 cells and suspended J 82 cells. The discrepancies of the two viability assays indicated a different response of the cell membrane to shock waves which was dependent on the exposure system and the cell type.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{feasibility study}} of using ultrasound {{to accomplish the}} dificult desorption of phenol from activated carbon and polymeric resin adsorbents is discussed. The desorption rates of activated carbon were found to significantly increase by ultrasound at 40 kHz and 1. 44 MHz. Attrition of the activated carbon due to cavitation could be prevented by operating at a higher frequency and with an intensity below {{the threshold of the}} pulverization of carbon. According to the structural stability study of Amberlite XAD- 4 and Dowex Optipore L- 493 resins to withstand the abrasive <b>cavitational</b> <b>effects</b> of ultrasound at 40 kHz, the Dowex Optipore resin was stable under experimental conditions and phenol desorption rates were enhanced significantly with sonication. The ultrasonic desorption rates were favored by decreased temperature, aerated liquid medium, and increased ultrasound intensity. The desorption rates obtained without ultrasound appeared to be limited by pore diffusion, whereas those obtained in the presence of ultrasound were limited by surface reaction. The rate enhancement was due to an increase in diffusive transport within the pores caused by acoustic vortex microstreaming. The activation energy for desorption decreased with an increase in ultrasonic power density, thus making the ultrasound weaken the adsorption bond...|$|R

We {{examined}} {{the effectiveness of}} the microbubbles of an echo contrast agent, dodecafluoropentane (DDFP) emulsion, to enhance low frequency ultrasound clot disruption in vitro and in vivo. Background. Ultrasound is reported to facilitate clot dissolution, and microbubbles could theoretically enhance ultrasound clot dissolution by augmenting <b>cavitational</b> <b>effects.</b> Methods. In vitro studies: The disruption rate of fresh human clots by ultrasound (24 kHz, 2. 9 W/cm 2) was examined in saline and DDFP emulsion. In vivo studies: Using a rabbit iliofemoral thrombotic occlusion model, recanalization rate and histopathologic findings were compared among groups treated with DDFP emulsion alone, transcutaneous ultrasound (20 kHz, 1. 5 W/cm 2) alone and with DDFP emulsion and ultrasound combined. Results. The ultrasound clot disruption rate was significantly (p < 0. 01) increased, from 72 ± 18 % (mean ± SD) in saline to 98 ± 4 % in DDFP emulsion in 3 min in vitro. No vessel was recanalized by DDFP emulsion alone (0 %), and only a single artery was patent after ultrasound treatment alone (9 %). In contrast, 82 % of iliofemoral arteries were angiographically recanalized after ultrasound treatment with DDFP emulsion. Histologically, the patent arteries had only minimal focal mural thrombus, with no evidence of vessel wall damage. However, substantial damage was observed in rabbit dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Conclusions. 1) DDFP emulsion, an echo contrast agent, significantly enhances the clot-disrupting effect of low frequency ultrasound in vitro and in an in vivo rabbit iliofemoral occlusion model. 2) This simple combination therapy has potential for clinical application in patients with thrombotic arterial occlusions...|$|R
30|$|Efficacy of sonophotocatalytic reactor {{depends on}} the number of {{hydroxyl}} radicals and uniform distribution of these radicals in the reactor (Anju et al. 2012). These results confirm that zinc oxide acts as a photocatalyst for UV operation and enhances the surface cavitational activity for US. Thus, the production of cavitational events per volume in the reactor and formation of actives sites for the generation of hydroxyl radicals/oxygen radicals are more in the case of US–UV (the presence of zinc oxide). The number of oxidizing radicals required for complete mineralization of BG {{depends on the}} number of oxidizing radicals needed for degradation of BG and degradation of intermediate products formed during the oxidation of BG (Hinge et al. 2016; Bhaskar et al. 2016; Dalbhanjan et al. 2016). The common oxidation products of BG are 4 -dimethylamino-phenol, (3 -dimethylamino-phenyl)-(4 -dimethylamino-phenyl)-methanone, phenol, 4 -dimethylamino-benzoic acid, dimethyl-phenyl-amine, (3 -amino-phenyl)-phenyl-methanone, 4 -amino-phenol, 3 -amino-benzoic acid/ 4 -amino-benzoic acid, aniline, oxalic acid, acetic acid, and acetamide. Complete degradation of these intermediates and BG depends on the physicochemical properties of the aqueous solution and the activity of these intermediate during the sonolysis and photolysis (Gogate and Bhosale 2013; Gole and Gogate 2014). Compounds with lower pH or pKa value attract towards the cavitational bubble or near the interface of the gas–liquid interface. Lower pH is also beneficial for the degradation of photocatalysis activity. At lower pH, the molecules quickly dissociated into the ions and cations. These ions rapidly deposited on the surface of photocatalyst (Li et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2016). Other factors also contributing to the degradation of BG are the intensity of radiation of UV light and uniform distribution of <b>cavitational</b> <b>effects</b> in the sonochemical reactor. The maximum absorption of UV radiations was improved by a selection of the location and position of UV light. UV light with immersed position was recommended for improving the distribution of light (Elsayed 2015; Sood et al. 2015). Degradation of BG using US–UV was found to be more efficient and has more potential for scale-up aspects.|$|R

The availability of these agents has enabled the study of cavitation biology in diagnostic ultrasound, a topic of non-ionising radiation biology which was previously a matter of conjecture.

40|$|Background Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the leading}} cause of death worldwide; a prompt intervention is needed to restore blood flow. Sonothrombolysis with or without addiction of thrombolytic drugs seems to be a promising solution, thanks to the non-invasiveness, precision and quickness of its action. Mechanical effects, rather than thermal, are employed. Even if the mechanisms involved are not completely understood, acoustic cavitation is credited to play a significant role. Materials and Methods An experimental setup to detect acoustic cavitation during in-vitro sonothrombolysis tests has been developed. A Passive Cavitation Detector (PCD), able to record pressure fluctuation of oscillating bubbles, is mounted confocally to a 1 MHz focused ultrasound transducer. Confocality has been verified by a 0. 2 mm needle hydrophone to map the pressure fields of both devices. A LDPE tube containing the thrombus is placed at the foci thanks to a 3 axis positioning frame. A constant flow of 2 ml/min is established. To detect inertial cavitation (broadband emission with an increase in white noise), the original signal from the PCD has been filtered analogically at 5 MHz in order to remove harmonic frequencies which could saturate the acquisition system. Results In-vitro sonothrombolysis tests have been carried out on human blood clots. Clots were exposed for two minutes to an acoustic field of 65 W (focal length 25 mm, focal diameter 3 mm), with pulse length of 450 μs and a duty cycle of 1 : 10. Acquisition of PCD signal was synchronized with the burst; two windows per second at a sampling frequency of 40 MHz were acquired. Power spectral density was calculated in the 5 - 12 MHz band, with digital notch filters at the super-harmonic frequencies, in order to quantify the cavitation dose. Figure on the left shows the results of two tests with the same acoustic parameters. Blue line refers to a test in which there was no evidence of thrombolysis. When complete thrombus disruption took place a temporal correlation between thrombolysis inception and the increment of white noise can be observed (red line). Conclusion The proposed setup demonstrated the ability to detect inertial cavitation while performing in-vitro sonothrombolysis tests; a correlation between thrombolysis inception and increment of white noise was found. Statistically significant analysis will be performed in order to verify this correlation, thus allowing the optimization of sonothrombolysis parameters and protocols in order to enhance <b>cavitational</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R

In the last few decades there has been a vast improvement in neurosurgical {{treatment of}} the lumbar disc herniation, and a lot of new treatment options have been devel-oped. There has been an expansion of endoscopic procedures like percutaneous endoscopic discectomy, laparoscopic discectomy, stereotactic guided discectomy, and an endoscope as-sisted discectomy, all of which are often used in our Department. The idea of using an ultrasonic aspirator for emulsification and aspiration of the lumbar and cervical intervertebral disc is not new. Current experiences in high energy ultrasound application yielded good results in neurosurgery, but so far only its application on the brain tissue was analyzed. The application of the high energy ultrasound on intervertebral disc tis-sue remains to be explored. The aim of this research is to display the effect of the high energy ultrasound application on the intervertebral disc tissue, and to analyze its application in lumbar disc herniation treatment. The final ultrasonic effect depends on the shape and intensity of the ultrasonic field, du-ration of its application and the amount of the ultrasonic energy as well as the characteristics of the tissue on which the ultrasound is applied. This research initially determined the acoustic characteristics of the contact ultrasound probe during its application on the intervertebral disc tissue. The acoustic power output measurement was analyzed using three types of experiments: calorimetric measurements, acoustic power deployment in the free acoustic field, and tip-displacement amplitude of the probe. The mechanism of high-intensity ultrasound effects on the tissue is still poorly under-stood, but the potential mechanisms include acoustic cavitation, shock-wave induced stress-es, acoustic microstreaming, direct jackhammer effect, and thermal lesion. All results meas-ured in free acoustic field are expected to vary in real situations. Acoustic parameters like the acoustic power and the acoustic cavitation shape are modi-fied during ultrasound application because of the damaging <b>cavitational</b> <b>effects</b> upon the flat surface of the contact probe tip. The investigation was carried out on 189 intervertebral discs extracted during autopsy on 63 cadavers.

40|$|Sonoelectroanalysis {{is applied}} to the {{detection}} of copper bound within human blood protein and whole blood. A solid glassy carbon electrode in a face on horn-to-electrode arrangement was first used to obtain silent and insonated square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) of a 10 % solution of whole blood in 0. 1 M HNO 3 electrolyte and the detection of copper in whole blood was shown to be possible. Analogous results were seen using a solution (3. 3 mg dL- 1) of ceruloplasmin in 0. 1 M HNO 3; in blood over 90 % of the copper is bound to this protein. It was shown that the enhancement of stripping peaks observed in ceruloplasmin and whole blood is not simply due to mass transport enhancement and <b>cavitational</b> cleaning <b>effects</b> alone but also the liberation of copper from the sites in which it is bound prior to preconcentration. The determination of copper status using whole blood was verified by using the microaddition technique to determine the copper content of two sample of laked horse blood.

40|$|The work {{contained}} {{in this thesis}} demonstrates that the introduction of power ultrasound into electrochemical systems can broaden the scope of techniques such as anodic stripping voltammetry. Analysis is facilitated by the well-documented phenomena associated with ultrasound, cavitation and acoustic streaming. Cavitation {{is caused by the}} collapse of voids created by ultrasonic compression and rarefaction of the solution and results in both localised high temperatures and pressures in the bulk solution and microjetting on the surface. Precise mechanistic details are still open to debate but there is evidence to suggest that shear forces at the interface when the electrode is flushed are responsible for removing organic material (particularly large species such as proteins) facilitating continuous cleaning and activation of the surface. Acoustic streaming has been shown to give diffusion layer thicknesses of the order of 1 - 10 μm depending on solvent and ultrasound power. The increased mass transport at such low diffusion layer thicknesses results in shorter preconcentration periods in electrochemical stripping voltammetry, greater sensitivity and a correspondingly lowered detection limit. Often ultrasound has been applied to highly passivating systems where conventional silent electroanalysis fails with the effect of transforming invisible or tiny voltammetric signals into large and quantitative responses suitable for sensitive and accurate analytical purposes. In Section IIthe relative contributions of acoustic streaming and cavitationally induced microjetting to the sonovoltammetric response is assessed. Chronoamperometry at insonated electrodes of both micro and macro dimensions, and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were used to explore the frequency and violence of cavitational events {{and the nature of the}} diffusion layer prevailing under steady-state electrolysis. The results lead to a physical model of an insonated electrode which may be described as a steady diffusion layer a few microns thick brought about by acoustic streaming which is occasionally and randomly punctuated by a cavitational event. The frequency and violence of the event is dependent on the solvent and ultrasound power, except at very short electrode-to-horn separation where the cavitational contribution becomes substantial. Section II concentrates on the implementation of the technique with applications to the detection of heavy metals in biofluids. In Chapter 4 sonoelectroanalysis is applied to the detection of copper bound within human blood protein and whole blood. It is shown that the enhancement of square wave anodic stripping peaks observed in ceruloplasmin and whole blood is not simply due to mass transport enhancement and <b>cavitational</b> cleaning <b>effects</b> alone but also the liberation of copper from the active sites in which it is bound prior to preconcentration. The results of a quantitative determination of total copper in two samples of whole blood were 1300 μg L - 1 and 620 μg L - 1, verified by independent blind analysis using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The need for rapid analysis of environmental samples can also be fulfilled using sonoelectroanalysis. In Chapter 5 fish gill mucus is used as a non-destructive biomarker for the detection of heavy metals by sono-square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (sono-SWASV). A quantitative assessment of copper content yielded values of 16 μgL - 1 and 21 μgL - 1 which compared favourably with independent blind analysis by AAS. The potential of the technique for detection of other heavy metals for example lead, was also demonstrated. Lead poisoning is recognized as a major environmental health risk and in Chapter 6 quantitative analysis of lead in artificial saliva from a realistic sputum volume, 220 μL, introduced to acetate buffer is investigated. An insonated preconcentration obviates the need for lengthy or degradative sample pretreatment by liberating the lead from the glycoproteins and other materials to which it binds in solution. Quantitative depassivation of the electrode surface by cavitational shearing maintained the analytical signal throughout the experiment where under silent conditions the signal diminished to zero with time. The detection limit in the analyte is 0. 25 μg L - 1. Following this proof of concept, Chapter 7 goes on to apply the technique to the quantitative determination of lead and cadmium in real human saliva. Close agreement between lead concentration determined by sono-SWASV and independent and blind ICP-MS is reported for human saliva samples with detection limits of 0. 5 μg L - 1 lead and 1 μg L - 1 cadmium in saliva. Section IV harnesses the benefits of acoustic emulsification. Power ultrasound is capable of forming droplets of micron dimensions with lower energy consumption than conventional emulsifiers. Chapter 8 acoustic emulsification is employed in the detection of vanillin (4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzaldehyde) in vanilla essence using ethyl acetoacetate as a novel electrochemical and sonoelectrochemical solvent. Contrasting with silent voltammetry, ultrasound facilitates emulsification and extraction of vanillin in the extract permitting an analytical square wave voltammetric signal to be obtained. Close agreement with a blind analysis of the samples using HPLC-UV is observed with a limit of detection in the biphasic medium of 0. 020 mM. In Chapter 9 acoustic emulsification is utilized in the solvent extraction of copper. Ultrasonic emulsification of an aqueous phase containing copper ions with the N-benzoyl-N-phenyl-hydroxylamine ligand in an organic ethyl acetate phase was shown to facilitate the extraction of copper into the organic phase at 25 °C. Subsequent emulsification with 1 M acid "back-extracts" or "re-strips" the copper into the aqueous phase prior to analysis via sono-SWASV. The technique necessarily removes contaminants present in the test solution since these will prefer to remain in the initial aqueous phase, or will transfer to the organic phase but are unlikely to be doubly transferred into the "clean" final aqueous phase. In Chapter 10 the technique is applied to the analysis of copper in the soft drink "Ribena® Light" with a detection limit of 2 μg L - 1 and copper in blood with a detection limit of 0. 16 μg L - 1. In the latter case the analysis required a sample volume of 100 μL suggesting that a pinprick test may be feasible. Finally in Section V, the analysis of copper in the presence of surfactants is investigated. Surfactant adsorption has been shown to have a passivating effect on the electrode surface during anodic stripping voltammetric measurements. Effluent, both industrial and domestic, is commonly contaminated with surfactant and electroanalysis of heavy metals is frequently precluded. It is therefore desirable to formulate a new analytical strategy in waste water. This is facilitated by controlled experiments with known amounts of anionic, cationic or neutral surfactant which also provides an ideal model system for comparing the techniques introduced in earlier Chapters. "Direct" sonoelectroanalysis in the medium of interest is compared with biphasic sono-solvent double extraction and both are appraised in the light of novel sonotrode technology. This thesis concludes that sonoelectroanalysis is a powerful and versatile analytical tool that can be employed in an expanding range of applications. The examples given herein are pertinent to the major fields of medical diagnosis and the assessment of environmental pollution. They demonstrate that sonoelectroanalysis is a viable alternative to conventional analytical techniques which have the disadvantages of more lengthy sample pretreatment and cost. Sonoelectroanalysis has the potential to become a portable technique especially in the light of the encouraging results presented using the single probe sonotrode, an instrument which is now commercially available in collaboration with Windsor Scientific Ltd. </p...|$|R
