In the beginning, the main theories and models that tackle this subject will be presented. In this respect, the paper starts with Smith, Ricardo, Manoilescu and Heckscher-Ohlin, in order to see the historic thought of trade model development. Following these models, a more mathematical approach will be made, using a thorough analysis at the product level. All the computations will be based on the <b>combined</b> <b>nomenclature</b> with its XXII classes, being the most exact determinant of traded goods.

This is the point where former, current and future specialized engines of potential trade growth can be established.

The study finds that, in almost all regions (exceptions are North-East and South-East Region) the international specialization has increased for products in which regions were initially relatively less specialized and has decreased for those in which they were initially highly specialized. Finally, most regions recorded large respectively small specialization improvements in products for which the internal respectively external demand expanded at the fastest rate over the time.

Considering the structure, the exports as well as imports consists of a some 3 / 4 proportion of goods included in six classes of the <b>Combined</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> the same at export as well as import, with a single exception. In the 2000 - 2007 period, excepting a single year, the imports had a growth more notable than exports, thus inducing a growing trade imbalance and a negative contribution to the real growth of GDP. This tendency reversed in 2008, was amplified in 2009, and it maintained in 2010 and 2011, leading initially 2008 to a trade imbalance stagnation, and, thereafter, to its considerable erosion and a positive contribution to the real growth of GDP in 2009...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the new EU Cohesion Policy and Europe 2020 strategy, regions are {{encouraged}} to build their own development strategies based on specialisation and innovation. Smart specialisation strategies aim to identify and focus on those activities in which the region has comparative advantages and at the same time, are characterized by a high added value. These activities have the power to bring the greatest benefits to the local and regional economy and, thus, reduce disparities between regions and enhance overall competitiveness of European regions. This paper analyzes data on exports and imports at the county level, on sections and chapters of the <b>Combined</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> in order to identify trends of specialisation of economic activity. Moreover, this approach provides information on the competitiveness of these counties, high export rates indicating a better adaptation to international markets.

30|$|To {{calculate}} {{the concentration of}} Spanish exports, we have used the export transactions database, which is elaborated by the Customs and Excise Department of the Spanish Tax Agency. For each transaction, we know the firm’s identification code, the product according to the 8 -digit <b>Combined</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> (CN) classification 2, the destination of the export transaction, the free-on-board (FOB) value in euros of the transaction, and the exported quantity (in weight metric and/or units). 3 Every year, new CN 8 codes {{are added to the}} classification and some CN codes are dropped. Since some sections of the paper compare data for different years, we use the Van Beveren et al. (2012) algorithm to create a consistent product classification over the period of analysis. 4 Using this database, we first analyze, how export concentration varies by the number of top firms. Second, we study whether concentration also occurs in export flows, where a flow is defined as a particular 8 -digit product shipped to a particular destination. Finally, we analyze how sensitive concentration is to different product classifications.|$|R
