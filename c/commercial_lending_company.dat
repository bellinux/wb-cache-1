40|$|Financial {{institutions}} such as banks are ultimately exposed to macroeconomic fluctuations I the countries {{to which they have}} exposure, the most acute example being <b>commercial</b> <b>lending</b> to <b>companies</b> whose fortunes fluctuate with aggregate demand. This risk management need for financial institutions motivated us to build a compact global macroeconomic model capable of generating (point as well as density) forecasts for a core set of macroeconomic factors for a set of regions and countries which explicitly allows for interconnections and interdependencies that exist between national and international factors. This paper provides such a global modeling framework; making use of recent advances in the analysis of cointegrating systems. In an unrestricted VAR(p) model in k endogenous variables covering N countries, the number of unknown parameters will be unfeasibly large, of order p(kN- 1), requiring a more parsimonious model specification. We first estimate individual country/region specific vector error correcting models, where the domestic macroeconomic variables are related to corresponding foreign variable constructed exclusively to match the international trade pattern of the country under consideration. The individual country models are then combined in a consistent and cohesive manner to generate forecasts for all the variables in the world economy simultaneously. We estimate the model for 26 countries grouped into 11 regions using quarterly data from 1970 Q 1 to 1999 Q 1 and shed light on the degree of regional interdependencies by investigating the time profile of the transmission of shocks to one variable in a given country/region {{to the rest of the}} world. We then use the estimated global model as the economic engine for generating a conditional loss distribution of a credit portfolio and illustrate the effects of various global risk scenarios on the loss distribution. Economic interlinkages, global macroeconomic modeling, credit loss distribution, risk management. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} {{recession}} and current economic recovery, policymakers have supported asset {{prices in the}} U. S. treasury and mortgage markets, expecting that improvement in the balance sheet of banks {{will lead to more}} <b>commercial</b> <b>lending.</b> In general, we document that increases in housing prices in a bank’s deposit base lead banks to decrease <b>commercial</b> <b>lending.</b> Further, we find that a one-standard deviation increase in housing prices is associated with a 6. 6 percentage point decrease in investment of borrowing firms and a 3. 4 percentage point decrease in leverage. These results suggest that when asset prices increase in one sector (such as the housing market), banks may respond by reallocating capital away from other sectors (such as <b>commercial</b> <b>lending)</b> towards the supported sectors...|$|R

40|$|The {{major concern}} {{of this paper}} is to {{determinate}} the causal relation among <b>commercial</b> banks <b>lending</b> and economic performance in a small open economy, Malaysia. Engle-Granger (1987) cointegration and causality methodology were used in analysis.

The long run elasticity of <b>commercial</b> banks <b>lending</b> on RGDP is 0. 50 and 2. 0 of RGDP on <b>commercial</b> banks <b>lending.</b> The causality analysis shows that the aggregate growth of <b>commercial</b> banks <b>lending</b> has no predictive content for economic growth. A reverse direction of causality was found there are economic growth do 'cause' growth of <b>commercial</b> banks <b>lending.</b> These results therefore imply a remarkable need of commercial banks credit while economic growth is well performed...|$|R

He also acquired a Maryland real estate salesman's license and investment banker's credentials. When Waynesboro Trust merged with the First National in 1926, Bloom left the bank and moved permanently to Baltimore, where his wife Hannah Jaffe Bloom (1885-1956) had lived alone except on weekends since 1905. Still buying for Bloom Brothers, Isaac now founded the Bloom Building and Loan Association, a <b>commercial</b> <b>lending</b> institution located during its first four years (1925-29) {{on the sixth floor}} of downtown Baltimore's fashionable Equitable Life Building, which still stands today.

40|$|The {{consequence}} of the economic crisis, the access of the external financing resources was narrowed significantly and lenders had became more cautious. This meant that the external source providers analyze more thoroughly the source claimants, and {{they also need to}} be more aware of their situation, to submit well founded loan applications to financial institutions. The other aspect is why the indicators presented in the study, the firms should be addressed much more thoroughly than ever before to have a much better understanding their situation, to recognize the sources of internal funding opportunities, and to use more efficiently the available internal resources. However, analysts should be aware of which are the ratios which should be paid a special attention and which ones are essential to assess a given situation, knowing them they can properly inform the leaders as well as to give an appropriate help to the decision makers. To ensure the appropriate level of internal resources the company's activity is continuous financing closely related to the working capital management. The other reason is why the working capital management coming into view - which is linked to the previous one - that longer and longer payment periods have emerged in the corporate sales, in point of fact there is a significant increase in <b>commercial</b> <b>lending</b> period, the <b>companies</b> must be able to finance this period. The working capital is essential for companies to determine their short-term financial positions. A significant change in working capital provides an important information to the company's various stakeholders, and {{this is especially true for}} the net working capital.
