5000|$|The Optimus Prime of the {{alternate}} universe of Transformers: Armada also possesses a Matrix (Much like the original Matrix, {{it serves as}} {{the symbol of the}} Autobot Commander). Prime is indeed a title given to leaders and Matrix-bearers in the Unicron Trilogy, as evidenced by both Vector Prime and Optimus Prime, but no other Primes are ever named. In Galaxy Force, Override (Nitro Convoy), Scourge (Flame Convoy), Evac (Live Convoy), and Metroplex (Megalo Convoy) all hold the title of Convoy as leaders of their respective planets, but this scheme does not carry over into the western translation, and so the Prime appellation does not apply. Likewise, in Super Link, the Japanese version of Energon, Rodimus is known as [...] "Rodimus Convoy", hearkening back to the name of his G1 predecessor. But again, this does not follow through in Hasbro's materials. Interestingly, Vector Prime is not known as Vector Convoy in Japan, but Vector Prime, while Optimus maintains the traditional <b>Convoy</b> <b>title</b> as Galaxy Convoy.|$|E
50|$|During wartime, a {{shipping}} convoy {{will have a}} ranking officer—sometimes an active-duty naval officer, at other times a civilian master or retired naval officer—designated as the <b>convoy</b> commodore. This <b>title</b> {{is not related to}} the individuals military rank (if any), but instead is the title of the senior individual responsible for the overall operation of the merchant ships and naval auxiliary ships that make up the convoy. The convoy commodore does not command the convoy escort forces (if any), which are commanded by a naval officer who serves as escort commander.|$|R
