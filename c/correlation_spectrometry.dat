An optical signal passing through both cells will suffer absorption due to the gas in each. If the absorption in the reference Cell is periodically modulated, then the total absorption depends on whether the gas absorption lines in the sampling cell correlate with those in the reference cell gas. Two methods of modulating the reference cell absorption are reported, pressure and Stark modulation. Results are presented for methane detection employing pressure modulation. The pressure fluctuations are generated within a compact resonant acoustic cell driven by a piezoelectric transducer.

40|$|Centrosomes are {{the main}} microtubule-organizing centers in animal cells. Centrosomes consist {{of a pair of}} centrioles {{surrounded}} by a matrix of pericentriolar material (PCM) that assembles from cytoplasmic components. In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, interactions between the coiled-coil proteins SPD- 5 and SPD- 2 and the kinase PLK- 1 are critical for PCM assembly. However, it is not known whether these interactions promote the formation of cytoplasmic complexes that are added to the PCM or whether the components interact only during incorporation into the PCM matrix. Here we address this problem by using a combination of live-cell fluorescence <b>correlation</b> spectroscopy, mass <b>spectrometry,</b> and hydrodynamic techniques to investigate the native state of PCM components in the cytoplasm. We show that SPD- 2 is monomeric, and neither SPD- 2 nor SPD- 5 exists in complex with PLK- 1. SPD- 5 exists mostly as a monomer but also forms complexes with the PP 2 A-regulatory proteins RSA- 1 and RSA- 2, which are required for microtubule organization at centrosomes.

However, the resolution achievable {{is limited by the}} diffraction properties of light, meaning that fine detail cannot be resolved. Various super-resolution microscopy methods have been developed to break this resolution limit. This thesis focuses on the single molecule localisation microscopy techniques. My host laboratory focuses on DNA replication and repair pathways using the model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast). The aim of this thesis is thus to apply the technique of photo-activatable localisation microscopy (PALM) to specific biological questions in order to establish its benefits and limitations. In theory, in PALM every molecule will be imaged once and, as such, could be counted. So far this has been largely limited to membrane proteins. Using a combination of artificially created fluorescent oligomers, endogenous ribonucleotide reductase proteins tagged with mEos and computer simulations I studied the feasibility of counting highly expressed cytoplasmic proteins and assigning them to complexes of known or unknown stoichiometry. I established that density of expression is a significant limiting factor when using PALM to resolve complex stoichiometry. I thus went on to develop a variation of fluorescence <b>correlation</b> <b>spectrometry</b> to study the same protein complexes {{to see if we could}} determine their stoichiometry by diffusion speed. I established that the technique could differentiate between quite small changes in size. However the endogenous complex did not respond well to the fluorophore used so I was not able to establish its size.

Yablonskaya Odessa National Medical University, Odessa, Ukraine Summary In this investigation problem of pharmacotherapy efficacy improvement was observed by mean of studying plasma and serum homeostatic alterations under the influence of different combinations in elderly with primary hypertension II stage combined with ischemic heart disease. For this aim 60 elder patients were examined and treated in the University Clinic of Odessa National Medical University. Mean age of the patients was 67. 2 ± 3. 8 years. Depending on prescribed treatment regimen (TR) all the patients were divided into 3 groups: lisinopril, cardiomagnil – TR I; lisinopril, bisoprolol, cardiomagnil – TR II; lisinopril, bisoprolol, indapamide, cardiomagnil – TR III. N= 20 in all the groups. Laser <b>correlation</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (LCS) was special biophysical investigation method. Blood serum and plasma were investigated biomaterial. TR I led to increase of intoxication processes in both investigated liquids – serum and plasma. TR II was effective in decrease of catabolic reactions and increase of anabolic ones in plasma, but in serum it caused decrease of anabolic alterations. TR III improved serum homeostasis condition, while in plasma anabolic reactions increased but in the same time was revealed growth of intoxication processes. LCS is rather sensitive method in reflection of blood serum and plasma homeostatic condition as before the treatment as after it. It allows reveal features of spectral picture after usage of specific combination. For further confirmation of informative capacity of the method must be found out associations of the LCS results with other laboratory investigations.

The basic concept of <b>correlation</b> <b>spectrometry</b> involves the passage of light sequentially through two gas cells, a reference cell containing a known quantity of the gas to be detected, and a sampling cell where {{the presence of the}} gas is to be determined. An optical signal passing sequentially through the cells will suffer absorption in each of the cells. If the absorption in the reference cell is periodically modulated, then the total absorption depends on whether the gas absorption lines in the sampling cell correlate with those in the reference cell gas. If the absorption lines of the gases do not correlate strongly, then the modulation index of the optical signal is essentially unaffected by the presence of the different gas in the sampling cell. Therefore, the concentration of a specific gas in the sampling cell can be quantified by this means. Pressure modulation of the gas within the reference cell is achieved by the use of a novel acoustic resonator. This device provides a reasonable pressure ratio whilst being compact and easily driven. Unlike previous piston-compressors, the high modulation frequency of the resonator improves the tolerance to transients in the optical signal produced by the passage of dust through the optical beam. The system can be tailored to detect a desired gas by changing the reference gas and a broadband section filter. Results for methane are presented in this paper. A novel method for detection of ammonia gas is reported for the first time. This involves Stark modulation of the gas in the reference cell, by the application of an electric field. This method is applicable to gases with strong electric dipole moments, such as NH 3, CO 2, NOx and HCl...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diabetic distal {{sensorimotor}} polyneuropathy (DSPN) is a frequent, disabling complication of diabetes mellitus. There is increasing evidence that sphingolipids {{play a role}} in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM). Whether neurotoxic 1 -deoxy-sphingolipids are elevated in DSPN patients' plasma and whether levels correlate to the DSPN stage were examined. METHODS: The plasma profile of 12 sphingoid bases in patients with DSPN and T 2 DM(n = 39) were cross-sectionally compared to other nerve disorders including chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) (n = 13), transthyretin-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) (n = 10), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (n = 13) and small fibre neuropathy (n = 12) by liquid chromatography mass <b>spectrometry.</b> <b>Correlations</b> to the DSPN stage were additionally performed. Furthermore, the sphingoid base distribution in sural nerve specimens was measured in patients with DSPN (n = 6) compared to CIDP (n = 3). RESULTS: A significantly increased amount of 1 -deoxy-sphingolipids [1 -deoxy-sphinganine (0. 11 ± 0. 06 μmol/l), 1 -deoxy-sphingosine (0. 24 ± 0. 16 μmol/l) ] in patients with DSPN was observed compared to age-matched healthy controls (0. 06 ± 0. 03 μmol/l; 0. 12 ± 0. 05 μmol/l) and to the other groups. (Para) clinical parameters including sensory loss, neuropathic pain, weakness, vibration perception, nerve conduction velocity, sensory nerve action potentials (sural nerve) and duration of T 2 DM did not correlate with plasma 1 -deoxy-sphingolipid levels, neither did the clinical stage according to the Dyck classification for DSPN. Sphingolipid levels in sural nerve biopsies showed no differences between DSPN and CIDP. Contrarily, patients with a small fibre neuropathy had decreased C₂₀-sphingosine plasma levels. CONCLUSION: 1 -deoxy-sphingolipid plasma levels are significantly elevated in DSPN. They are already detectable in early disease stages but do not correlate with the clinical course. Further knowledge on 1 -deoxy-sphingolipids might lead to a better pathophysiological understanding and future treatment options in DSPN...|$|R
40|$|SSCI-VIDE+CARE+MBMInternational audienceThe {{chemical}} composition of ambient organic aerosols was analyzed using complementary mass spectrometric techniques during a field study in central Europe in July 2014 (Fichtelgebirge -Biogenic Emission and Aerosol Chemistry, F-BEACh 2014). Among several common biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA) marker compounds, 93 acidic oxygenated hydrocarbons were detected with elevated abundances and were thus attributed to be characteristic for the organic aerosol mass at the site. Monoterpene measurements exhibited median mixing ratios of 1. 6 and 0. 8 ppb(V) for in and above canopy levels respectively. Nonetheless, concentrations for early-generation oxidation products were rather low, e. g., pinic acid (c = 4. 7 (+/- 2. 5) ng m(- 3)). In contrast, high concentrations {{were found for}} later-generation photooxidation products such as 3 -methyl- 1, 2, 3 -butanetricarboxylic acid (MBTCA, c = 13. 8 (+/- 9. 0) ng m(- 3)) and 3 -carboxyheptanedioic acid (c = 10. 2 (+/- 6. 6) ng m(- 3)), suggesting that aged aerosol masses were present during the campaign period. In agreement, HYSPLIT trajectory calculations indicate {{that most of the}} arriving air masses traveled long distances (> 1500 km) over land with high solar radiation In addition, around 47 % of the detected compounds from filter sample analysis contained sulfur, confirming a rather high anthropogenic impact on biogenic emissions and their oxidation processes.

40|$|Patients {{suffering}} from neuroendocrine tumors are oftentimes presented with spread disease {{at the time}} of diagnosis. Therapy using somatostatin analogs is today the only potentially curative treatment option for these patients. However, the kidneys are the dose-limiting organs in this type of therapy and the biological impact from radiopharmaceutical treatment is not fully understood. Furthermore, considering the large inter-individual variations in renal absorbed dose and toxicity, biomarkers for radiation damage would be of great significance in this type of therapy. The aims of this project were to study the normal kidney tissue response in vivo in mice following 177 Lu and 177 Lu-octreotate administration, to identify potential biomarkers following 177 Lu exposure and evaluate their dependencies of absorbed dose, dose-rate, and time after injection, and to correlate these results with functional and morphological effects. The injected activity ranged between 0. 3 and 150 MBq following 177 Lu/ 177 Lu-octreotate administration and the biological effect was investigated between 15 minutes and one year after administration. Transcriptional and miRNA variations were studied using microarray analysis and protein expression was investigated using mass <b>spectrometry.</b> <b>Correlations</b> between the transcriptional and protein variations were performed with functional parameters, as determined by 99 mTc-DTPA/ 99 mTc-DMSA scintigraphy, and with the morphological effects following 177 Lu-octreotate administration. The number of differentially regulated transcripts following 177 Lu/ 177 Lu-octreoate administration was dependent on absorbed dose, dose-rate, time after injection, and tissue (kidney cortex or medulla) investigated. No transcript was found to be differentially regulated at all exposure conditions. The most recurrently regulated genes were the Serpina 10 gene in kidney cortex, and the Egr 1, Pck 1, and Hmgcs 2 genes in kidney medulla. Substantial differences in response were found between 177 Lu-octreotate and 177 LuCl 3. Concerning the miRNA and protein data, a high absorbed dose-specificity was found, with few miRNAs/proteins found recurrently regulated at most exposure conditions. The transcriptional analyses showed a strong and diverse transcriptional response and the functional analyses revealed clear negative effects on renal function, with enhanced negative effects with absorbed dose and time after administration. Several potentially useful biomarkers were detected at the transcriptional level, markers with potential applicability in early prediction of late renal injury after 177 Lu/ 177 Lu-octreotate exposure...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explored {{and expanded}} {{the capability of}} liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics in discovering metabolites of significant biological interest in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Metabolomics, the comprehensive measurement of metabolites in a biological system, is usually classified into targeted and untargeted metabolomics. While targeted metabolomics only focuses on {{a certain type of}} metabolites, untargeted metabolomics deals with as many metabolites as possible. Therefore, untargeted metabolomics is usually more challenging but can provide more valuable information to generate new hypotheses for further investigation. In this work, LC-MS based untargeted comparative metabolomics was used to discover antimicrobial drug leads and small signaling compounds, i. e., ascarosides in C. elegans. First, worm extracts from two mutants and one wild type C. elegans were analyzed by LC-MS. By using data pre-processing programs and statistical analysis tools, a list of compounds of statistical significance was obtained. Among them four compounds or mass features were found to have high <b>correlation.</b> Tandem mass <b>spectrometry</b> and in-source collision induced dissociation (CID) experiments confirmed these mass features share common chemical structures. Further structural elucidation is required to obtain their exact molecular formulae. In the second part, three programs were evaluated and compared in processing LC-MS raw data. Among these programs, XCMS was found to give more consistent results. XCMS also produced many fewer significant mass features than either MZmine 2 or Mass Profiler Professional (MPP). Both XCMS and MZmine 2 were able to find the four significant mass features observed in the first part, however, MZmine 2 consumed more time and computer resource. Issues related with peak detection were identified for MPP and MZmine 2. The third part combined the LC-MS untargeted comparative metabolomics, in-source CID, and a self-built database to discover ascarosides in media extracts of C. elegans. Similar to the first part, significant mass features were obtained. Together with tandem MS, the discovery of the known ascarosides proved the validity of the approach. Several previously un-described ascarosides were identified, which need further structure elucidation. It was proposed that fragment ions at m/z 113 and m/z 131 may be used to quickly screen ascarosides in positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{is often}} used to assess {{rangeland}} condition and biophysical parameters across large areas. In particular, the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and above-ground biomass can be used to assess rangeland primary productivity (seasonal carbon gain or above-ground biomass “yield”). We evaluated the NDVI–yield relationship for a southern Alberta prairie rangeland, using seasonal trends in NDVI and biomass during the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons, two years with contrasting rainfall regimes. The study compared harvested biomass and NDVI from field spectrometry to NDVI from three satellite platforms: the Aqua and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Système Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT 4 and 5). <b>Correlations</b> between ground <b>spectrometry</b> and harvested biomass were also examined for each growing season. The contrasting precipitation patterns were easily captured with satellite NDVI, field NDVI and green biomass measurements. NDVI provided a proxy measure for green plant biomass, and was linearly related to the log of standing green biomass. NDVI phenology clearly detected the green biomass increase {{at the beginning of each}} growing season and the subsequent decrease in green biomass at the end of each growing season due to senescence. NDVI–biomass regressions evolved over each growing season due to end-of-season senescence and carryover of dead biomass to the following year. Consequently, mid-summer measurements yielded the strongest correlation (R 2 = 0. 97) between NDVI and green biomass, particularly when the data were spatially aggregated to better match the satellite sampling scale. Of the three satellite platforms (MODIS Aqua, MODIS Terra, and SPOT), Terra yielded the best agreement with ground-measured NDVI, and SPOT yielded the weakest relationship. When used properly, NDVI from satellite remote sensing can accurately estimate peak-season productivity and detect interannual variation in standing green biomass, and field spectrometry can provide useful validation for satellite data in a biomass monitoring program in this prairie ecosystem. Together, these methods can be used to identify the effects of year-to-year precipitation variability on above-ground biomass in a dry mixed-grass prairie. These findings have clear applications in monitoring yield and productivity, and could be used to support a rangeland carbon monitoring program...|$|R
