Docking of steroid molecules into this homology-modeled CYP 2 C 11 indicated that 16 α-hydroxylation is favored with steroidal molecules possessing the following components, (1) a bent A-B ring configuration (5 β-reduced), (2) C- 3 α-hydroxyl group, (3) C- 17 β-acetyl group, and (4) methyl group at both the C- 18 and C- 19. These respective steroid <b>components</b> <b>requirements</b> were defined as the inhibitory contribution factor. Overall studies of the male rat CYP 2 C 11 metabolism revealed that the above-mentioned steroid <b>components</b> <b>requirements</b> were essential to induce an effective inhibition of [3 H]progesterone 16 α-hydroxylation. As far as docking of homology-modeled CYP 2 C 11 against investigated steroids is concerned, they are docked at the active site superimposed with flurbiprofen.

The present study attempted to determine the relationship between PRP length and response rate, and <b>component</b> <b>requirements</b> of a multiple fixed ratio schedule. Schedule interactions were examined when behavior was maintained at a given pair of schedules for a prolonged time, and when both schedules were studied at various values.

40|$|The present {{situation}} in NDE {{in the nuclear}} industry in the Federal Republic of Germany can be described briefly as follows. To achieve basic safety of nuclear power plant <b>components,</b> <b>requirements</b> are established to assure satisfactory fabrication and testing conditions {{as well as a}} favourable stress curve under operating loads. Basic safety depends on: high-quality material charcteristics, in particular toughness; a conservative restriction of stress; prevention of stress peaks through optimal design; assurance of the application of optimized manufacturing and testing technologies; knowledge and assessment of possible faulty conditions; consideration of the operating fluid and temperature. If basic safety requirements are fulfilled, growth of residual fabrication defects or inhomogeneities for the lifetime of a nuclear powerplan plant is not expected.
