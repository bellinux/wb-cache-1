5|$|Art Salsberg {{became the}} editor of Popular Electronics in 1974 with a goal of {{reclaiming}} the lead in projects. He wanted to publish a computer project that was more functional and elegant than the Mark-8. Les Solomon knew MITS was working on an Intel 8080 based computer project and thought Roberts <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> project for the always popular January issue.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{showcase}} the PlayStation Portable's capabilities, {{the team had}} to develop a download system that <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> game with future downloadable content, which included new tracks, music and ships. In addition, Burrows realised that new downloadable content {{had the potential to}} bring in more revenue for Studio Liverpool. In order to achieve this, the team {{had to find a way}} to bypass the problems involved in getting the PlayStation Portable to recognise download files. The solution required the use of piggybacking game data to a valid format recognised by the PlayStation Portable; in which a dummy file would be used on a web-based Java application.|$|E
5|$|When {{the system}} was first being {{proposed}} {{it was not clear}} whether the phased-array systems <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> accuracy needed to guide the missiles to a successful interception at very long ranges. Early concepts retained Zeus Missile Tracking Radars and Target Tracking Radars (MTRs and TTRs) for this purpose. In the end, the MAR proved more than capable of the required resolution, and these additional radars were dropped.|$|E
6000|$|At once Dave {{remembered the}} letter {{picked up on}} Bush Island--the letter written by Doctor Montgomery, and asking Jasniff {{to meet him at}} Dunn's on the river. In that {{communication}} the doctor had said he would aid Jasniff all he <b>could,</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> Rockville student would assist him in some transaction involving little risk--which would mean that there must be something [...] "shady" [...] about it.|$|R

5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|Tyler Walker, the ADR {{director}} of the English dub of the series, held auditions for six days, during which about 140 people came for the eighteen main roles. Walker states that {{this is probably the}} longest casting process Funimation has held. He comments that {{because there are a lot}} of characters and most of them are older men, a character type he does not work with often, choosing voice actors and familiarizing them with their characters was difficult. He asked many directors and actors for recommendations and mainly aimed to cast newcomers, as he felt Baccano! provided him a chance to discover newer talent. Walker wished to find actors who <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> dialect and accents of the various time periods and locations, especially when casting for the characters with heavy European accents.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 22 October 1793, Agamemnon sighted five sails. Nelson closed with them, and {{discovered}} they were a French squadron. He promptly gave chase, firing on the 40-gun Melpomene. During the Action of 22 October 1793 he inflicted considerable damage but the remaining French ships turned to join the battle and, realising he was outnumbered, Nelson withdrew and continued to Cagliari, arriving on 24 October. After making repairs, Nelson and Agamemnon sailed again on 26 October, bound for Tunis with a squadron under Commodore Robert Linzee. On his arrival, Nelson was given command of a small squadron consisting of Agamemnon, three frigates and a sloop, and ordered to blockade the French garrison on Corsica. The fall of Toulon at the end of December 1793 severely damaged British fortunes in the Mediterranean. Hood had failed to make adequate provision for a withdrawal and 18 French ships-of-the-line fell into republican hands. Nelson's mission to Corsica took on added significance, as it <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> British a naval base close to the French coast. Hood therefore reinforced Nelson with extra ships during January 1794.|$|E

5000|$|The {{community}} {{attempted to}} incorporate in 1984, but the regional boundary commission halted the effort after determining <b>the</b> community <b>could</b> not <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> needed municipal {{services of a}} city.|$|R
25|$|Being {{isolated}} from the oceans, such lakes could have been stagnant and anoxic at depth, much like today's Black Sea; a sufficient input of iron <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> necessary conditions for BIF formation. A further difficulty in suggesting that BIFs {{marked the end of}} the glaciation is that they are found interbedded with glacial sediments. BIFs are also strikingly absent during the Marinoan glaciation.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} crisis in 2001 was the final blow and neither the private companies nor the government <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> service required. In 2003, the new administration of President Néstor Kirchner set it as a key policy objective to revive the national rail network. Although the economic upturn saw traffic grow again, the suburban rail operators were still little more than managers of government contracts rather than true entrepreneurs.|$|E
25|$|In a $6.3 million Army {{initiative}} to invent devices for telepathic communication, Gerwin Schalk, underwritten in a $2.2 million grant, {{found that it}} is possible to use ECoG signals to discriminate the vowels and consonants embedded in spoken and in imagined words. The results shed light on the distinct mechanisms associated with production of vowels and consonants, and <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> basis for brain-based communication using imagined speech.|$|E

50|$|The {{court ruled}} {{artificial}} insemination {{does not constitute}} adultery. However, Mrs MacLennan <b>could</b> not <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> court with any proof of her taking artificial insemination. Mr MacLennan therefore got his divorce.|$|R
60|$|Her {{food was}} the best that their limited stores and the rifle of <b>the</b> Swede <b>could</b> <b>provide,</b> but <b>the</b> thing that touched her heart the closest was the gentle {{consideration}} and courtesy which the man always accorded her.|$|R
25|$|British {{forces had}} {{initially}} garrisoned Crete when the Italians attacked Greece on 28 October 1940, enabling the Greek government {{to employ the}} Fifth Cretan Division in the mainland campaign. This arrangement suited the British: Crete <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy with excellent harbours in the eastern Mediterranean, from which it could threaten the Axis south-eastern flank, and the Ploieşti oil fields in Romania would be within range of British bombers based on the island.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Cooke's direct infusion of {{capital in the}} railroads, the firm had become a federal agent for {{the government in the}} government's direct financing of railroad construction. As building new track in areas where land had not yet been cleared or settled required land grants and loans that only the government <b>could</b> <b>provide,</b> <b>the</b> use of Jay Cooke's firm as a conduit for federal funding worsened the effects that Cooke's bankruptcy had on the nation's economy.|$|E
25|$|One of the editors, Les Solomon, knew MITS {{was working}} on an Intel 8080 based {{computer}} project and thought Roberts <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> project for the always popular January issue. The TV Typewriter and the Mark-8 computer projects were just a detailed set of plans {{and a set of}} bare printed circuit boards. The hobbyist faced the daunting task of acquiring all of the integrated circuits and other components. The editors of Popular Electronics wanted a complete kit in a professional-looking enclosure.|$|E
50|$|Where a {{charitable}} trust (other than an ecclesiastical charity) existed in a parish, <b>the</b> Charity Commissioners <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> for <b>the</b> parish council {{to become the}} trustees. Annual accounts of the charity were to be laid before the parish meeting.|$|R
25|$|Much of {{the debate}} about the 'Iranian nuclear threat' is {{therefore}} driven by concern that Iran's mastery of civilian technology <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> it <b>the</b> means to rapidly develop a weapons capability should Iran wish {{to do so in the}} future.|$|R
50|$|Fynwest {{planned to}} send these {{recruits}} to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, where international standard training <b>could</b> be <b>provided.</b> <b>The</b> newly trained stevedores would then {{take part in}} an Australian non-union dock workers training program.|$|R
25|$|The primary Scottish {{objective}} of ending the Union was now possible {{and they wanted}} to consolidate their position; although willing to assist an English rising or French invasion, they would not do it on their own. For the Irish, only a Stuart on the British throne <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> autonomous, Catholic Ireland promised them by James II. Charles argued only removing the Hanoverians could guarantee an independent Scotland and thousands of supporters would join once they entered England, while the Marquis d'Eguilles provided assurances a French landing was imminent.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantines {{made great}} use of ‘soft armour’ of quilted, padded textile {{construction}} {{identical to the}} “jack” or aketon found later in the Latin West. Such a garment, called the kavadion, usually reaching to just above the knees with elbow or full-length sleeves, was often the sole body protection for lighter troops, both infantry and cavalry. Alternatively the kavadion <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> base garment (like an arming doublet) worn under metallic armour by more heavily protected troops. Another form of padded armour, the epilōrikion, could be worn over a metal cuirass.|$|E
25|$|On 26 October, after Agamemnon {{had been}} repaired, Weatherhead {{found himself on}} the way to Tunis with a {{squadron}} under Commodore Robert Linzee.

25|$|Skirts {{were now}} {{assembled}} of shaped panels, since gathering a straight length of fabric <b>could</b> not <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> width required at the hem without unwanted bulk at the waist; this spelled {{the end of}} the brief fashion for border-printed dress fabrics.|$|R
25|$|Using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) {{researchers}} {{have shown that}} reward dependence is linked to opiate receptor binding (the endorphine system) in the bilateral ventral striatum: a core substrate of the reward circuit which is strongly implicated in addictive behavior development. These findings demonstrate that people with high reward dependence (who feel a greater need for social rewards and verbal approval) have more opiate receptors found in the ventral striatum, whereas people with low reward dependence have a lower concentration of receptors. It is then suggested that increased ventral striatal opiate receptors <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> biological link between personality traits and substance abuse risk.|$|E
25|$|Within the Party, {{there was}} major debate about redistribution. A {{moderate}} faction {{within the party}} and Politburo member Liu Shaoqi argued that change should be gradual and any collectivization of the peasantry should wait until industrialization, which <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> agricultural machinery for mechanized farming. A more radical faction led by Mao Zedong argued {{that the best way}} to finance industrialization was for the government to take control of agriculture, thereby establishing a monopoly over grain distribution and supply. This would allow the state to buy at a low price and sell much higher, thus raising the capital necessary for the industrialization of the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{importation}} of the Aesculapium established {{medicine in the}} public domain. There is no record of fees being collected for a stay at one of them, at Rome or elsewhere. The expense of an Aesculapium must have been defrayed {{in the same way}} as all temple expenses: individuals vowed to perform certain actions or contribute a certain amount if certain events happened, some of which were healings. Such a system amounts to gradated contributions by income, as the contributor could only vow what he <b>could</b> <b>provide.</b> <b>The</b> building of a temple and its facilities on the other hand was the responsibility of the magistrates. The funds came from the state treasury or from taxes.|$|E
40|$|Mirko Draca {{argues that}} the government’s policy on {{lobbying}} does not go far enough. The reporting of financial information is vital for maximizing the effectiveness of any lobbying register and omitting in-house lobbyists could reduce the information <b>the</b> register <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> anyway. <b>The</b> government also needs to deal with practical issues concerning how data is <b>provided</b> to <b>the</b> public...|$|R
