25|$|The rockoon (a {{portmanteau}} of rocket and balloon) was a {{solid fuel}} rocket that, rather than being immediately lit while on the ground, was first carried into the upper atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon. Then, once separated from the balloon at its maximum height, the rocket was automatically ignited. This achieved a higher altitude, since the rocket {{did not have to}} move through the lower thicker air layers that would have required much more <b>chemical</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E
25|$|By contrast, most {{chemical}} oxidation reactions (such as burning coal or TNT) release {{at most a}} few eV per event. So, {{nuclear fuel}} contains at least tenmillion times more usable energy per unit mass than does <b>chemical</b> <b>fuel.</b> The energy of nuclear fission is released as kinetic energy of the fission products and fragments, and as electromagnetic radiation {{in the form of}} gamma rays; in a nuclear reactor, the energy is converted to heat as the particles and gamma rays collide with the atoms that make up the reactor and its working fluid, usually water or occasionally heavy water or molten salts.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} free energy {{contained}} in nuclear fuel is millions {{of times the}} amount of free energy contained in a similar mass of <b>chemical</b> <b>fuel</b> such as gasoline, making nuclear fission a very dense source of energy. The products of nuclear fission, however, are on average far more radioactive than the heavy elements which are normally fissioned as fuel, and remain so for significant amounts of time, giving rise to a nuclear waste problem. Concerns over nuclear waste accumulation and over the destructive potential of nuclear weapons are a counterbalance to the peaceful desire to use fission as an energy source, and give rise to ongoing political debate over nuclear power.|$|E
25|$|The ABL did not {{burn through}} or {{disintegrate}} its target. It heated the missile skin, weakening it, causing failure from high speed flight stress. The laser used <b>chemical</b> <b>fuel</b> similar to rocket propellant {{to generate the}} high laser power. Plans called for each 747 to carry enough laser fuel for about 20 shots, or {{perhaps as many as}} 40 low-power shots against fragile TBMs. To refuel the laser, YAL-1 would have to land. The aircraft itself could have been refueled in flight, which would have enabled it to stay aloft for long periods. Preliminary operational plans called for the ABL to be escorted by fighters and possibly electronic warfare aircraft. The ABL aircraft would likely have had to orbit near potential launch sites (located in hostile countries) for long periods, flying a figure-eight pattern that allows the aircraft to keep the laser aimed toward the missiles.|$|E
