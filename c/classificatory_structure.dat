The selection of concepts took place based on the terms resulted from an oral research in three geographical cities of Amazon: Bragança, Castanhal and Marajó archipelago. Results: The analysis of etymological origins of the words indicated the influence of foreign culture from the European, African, Asiatic and American continents in the Amazon language.

40|$|THENOTION OF THE CLASSIFICATION SCHEME as a {{transitional}} element or “boundary object ” (Star, 1989) offers an alternativc {{to the more}} traditional approach that views classification as an organizational structure imposed upon a body of knowledge to facilitate access within a universal and frequently static framework. Recognition of the underlying relationship between user access and the collective knowledge structures that are the basis for knowledge production indicates the dynamic role of classification in supporting coherence and articulation across heterogeneous contexts. To this end, {{it is argued that}} the library should be an active participant in the production of knowledge, and that this role can be effected by the development of classificatory structures that can support the needs of a diverse information ecology consisting of a complex web of interacting agents, users, and technologies. Within such an information ecology, a <b>classificatory</b> <b>structure</b> cannot follow a one-size-fits-all paradigm but must evolve in cooperative interaction between librarians and their user groups...|$|E

We use the cosine function for similarity and test it on automatically classifying 120 target words from four regions, using different datasets for the extraction of feature vectors. The automatic classification results were evaluated against human judgement, and the performance was encouraging, with accuracy reaching over 85 % in some cases. Thus while human judgement is not straightforward {{and it is difficult to}} create a Pan-Chinese lexicon manually, it is observed that combining simple clustering methods with the appropriate data sources appears to be a promising approach toward its automatic construction. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{structural}} {{complexity of}} culture cannot {{be characterized by}} simply modeling cultural beliefs or inherited ideas. Formal computational and algorithmic models of culture {{have focused on the}} inheritance of discrete cultural units, which can be hard to define and map to practical contexts. In cultural anthropology, research involving structuralist and post-structuralist perspectives have helped us better understand culturally-dependent classification systems and oppositional phenomena (e. g. light-dark, hot-cold, good-evil). Contemporary research in cognitive neuroscience suggests that complementary sets may be represented dynamically in the brain, but no model for the evolution of these sets has of yet been proposed. To fill this void, a method for simulating cultural or other highly symbolic behaviors called contextual geometric structures will be introduced. The contextual geometric structures approach is based on a hybrid model that approximates both individual/group cultural practice and a fluctuating environment. The hybrid model consists of two components. The first is a set of discrete automata with a soft <b>classificatory</b> <b>structure.</b> These automata are then embedded in a Lagrangian-inspired particle simulation that defines phase space relations and environmental inputs. The concept of conditional features and equations related to diversity, learning, and forgetting are used to approximate the goaldirected and open-ended features of cultural-related emergent behavior. This allows cultural patterns to be approximated in the context of both stochastic and deterministic evolutionary dynamics. This model can yield important information about multiple structures and social relationships, in addition to phenomena related to sensory function and higher-order cognition observed in neural systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{main object}} of the paper is to {{demonstrate}} in detail the role of classification in information retrieval (IR) and the design of <b>classificatory</b> <b>structures</b> by the application of logical division to all forms {{of the content of}} records, subject and imaginative.

The latter is seen not as a particular kind of library classification but the only viable form enabling the locating and relating of information to be optimally predictable. A detailed exposition of the practical steps in facet analysis is given, drawing on the experience of the new Bliss Classification (BC 2). The continued existence of the library as a highly organized information store is assumed. But, it is argued, it must acknowledge the relevance of the revolution in library classification that has taken place. It considers also how alphabetically arranged subject indexes may utilize controlled use of categorical (generically inclusive) and syntactic relations to produce similarly predictable locating and relating systems for IR. 1...|$|R

First made {{available}} online on 26 February 2015. In this dissertation I examine {{the uses of}} the notions of civilization, race, and culture within a set of British 19 th century discourses on especially Southeast Asian societies, their present state and history. Taking the point of departure in John Crawfurd's (1783 - 1868) publications, it contains {{a study of the}} many debates on economic, ethnological, historical, and linguistic issues in which he participated throughout six decades and to which he contributed significantly. Through this approach I aim at providing a densely contextualized analysis of the colonial, intellectual, political, and socio-cultural aspects of Crawfurd et al's knowledge production, its routes of transmission, receptions, and appropriations. The analytic focus is directed at the evaluative-descriptive qualities attributed to the terms civilization, race, and culture, and immanent in the concepts they refer to; on the surface claiming to be primarily descriptive, they nonetheless were normatively cogent in their inherent hierarchal and <b>classificatory</b> <b>structures,</b> as well as in providing a theoretical template delineating the naturalized historical trajectories. Arguing that the notions of civilization, race and culture were pivotal key concepts in this colonial knowledge production, I chart the intertwined dynamics between these notions / both in their conceptual framings and contextualized uses. During this quest I endeavour to demonstrate the interpretive primacy of the concept of civilization throughout the entire period, even though racial concerns clearly were on the ascendancy and by the 1860 s constituted the major theme of discussion and dissent. Common to all the analysed discourses is that they were hinged upon these three fundamental notions and their ability to address the universal as well as the particular, their capacity to encompass the past, present and future within one interpretive framework, and not at least their provision of a conceptual common ground which also, however, facilitated the possibilities of fundamental dissent within the actual interpretations...|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} {{point in this}} essay assumes a view on photography through small fragments conceived as parts of a poliptic. If, as Barthes claims, everything can be a text, what is of interest here {{is not so much}} the meaning, nor the comparative and/or evolutive understanding that endows the present with the last word, but a stress on the character of heterogeneity and unrest when an ordaining and <b>classificatory</b> <b>structure</b> can be moved and its hierarchy undone over the technique and the documental record codified by the historical or journalistic relevance. In times of an unthinkable expansion of the imagetic arsenal and of screens that untiringly promise to reveal the facts in real time, be it a matter of intimate facts, be it a matter of facts of planetary significance, it seems wise to suspend those certainties about the photographic image in order to interrogate its very nature, asking how it survives such metamorphoses, constituting itself and persisting in its artistic condition. O ponto de partida deste texto pressupõe um pensamento sobre a fotografia através de pequenos fragmentos concebidos como partes de um políptico.

Em tempos de expansão inimaginável do arsenal imagético e de telas que prometem revelar incansavelmente os fatos em tempo real, sejam eles íntimos ou de relevância planetária, parece conveniente suspender as certezas sobre a imagem fotográfica para interrogar sua natureza, problematizando como a mesma sobrevive por metamorfoses, constituindo-se e persistindo em sua condição artística...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} organisation {{of items}} on library shelves using any classification scheme is inevitably a compromise. The {{best efforts to}} achieve an arrangement char is helpful to users will be thwarted by the multifaceted nature of these items and {{the specific needs of}} the user and the library. Items on a particular subject will be scattered throughout the library building(s) across disciplines, by physical form, by frequency of use and whether and for how long they may be borrowed. Even though the rich information content of multifaceted items may be represented in the notation, the items required by a user will be scattered across library shelves when the item is placed in a single relative location. This paper explores these issues using examples from a University Library classified using the Dea ey Decimal Classification Scheme (DDC). The electronic context of the library OPAC can transcend the constraints imposed by the predominantly physical nature of library collections, yet the current use of classification schemes in on-line systems retains many of these limitations. Examples of such systems applying DDC on the World Wide Web are discussed and compared with a system that seeks to use DDC in what is called view-based searching. The interface and the resulting browsing and searching capability of a View-Based Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) are described. Ways in which subject. access to library collections can be improved and disciplinary scatter resolved by assigning multiple class numbers to items and exploiting the rich Dewey structure in a faceted form are discussed. It is suggested that the informative power of visual <b>classificatory</b> <b>structures</b> at the search interface will be beneficial to the broader learning experience of the user. The paper concludes that the application of classification schemes in electronic interfaces should not be bound by the physical constraints that no longer apply in an electronic context but be exploited to provide a complete, flexible and individual interface as determined by the needs of each user...|$|R

New technologies continue to reshape the nature and content of catalogs, stretch the boundaries of classiﬁcation research, and provide new alternatives for the organization of information. Research studies have rigorously {{analyzed the}} structure of the Anglo- American Cataloguing Rules using entity-relationship modeling and expanded on the bibliographic and authority relationship research to develop new data models (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records [FRBR] and Functional Requirements and Numbering of Authority Records [FRANAR]).

A growing international perspective focused research on multilingual subject access, transliteration problems in surrogate records, and user studies to improve Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) displays for large retrieval sets resulting from federated searches. The need to organize local and remote electronic resources led to metadata research that developed general and domain-speciﬁc metadata schemes. Ongoing research in this area focuses on record structures and architectural models to enable interoperability among the various schemes and differing application platforms. Research in the area of subject access and classiﬁcation is strong, covering areas such as vocabulary mapping, automatic facet construction and deconstruction for Web resources, development of expert systems for automatic classiﬁca- tion, dynamically altered <b>classiﬁcatory</b> <b>structures</b> linked to domain-speciﬁc thesauri, crosscultural conceptual structures in classiﬁcation, identiﬁcation of semantic relationships for vocabulary mapped to classiﬁcation systems, and the expanded use of traditional classiﬁcation systems as switching languages in the global Web environment.
