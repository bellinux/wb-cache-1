5|$|After Bardulf's death, a {{legal case}} was brought against Bardulf's {{chaplain}} and constable, alleging that Bardulf had allowed his two servants {{to hear a}} case that should have been heard by the justice. The litigants <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> the two servants had wrongly decided the case, and after hearing the allegations, the royal justices at Westminster agreed and restored the disputed property to the litigants.|$|E
5|$|Burton was reindicted, {{still in}} the circuit court Eastern District of Missouri, on April 13, 1905, and arraigned on June 4 before Judge John Henry Rogers, of the Western District of Arkansas, sitting by designation. The new {{indictment}} had eight counts. The first, second, fourth, sixth, and eighth counts <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> Burton had agreed to receive compensation from Rialto. The third, fifth, and seventh counts <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> Burton had actually received compensation from Rialto. The counts different only {{in the interest of}} the United States which was alleged to have been involved in the matter. Counts four and five were dismissed before trial. Unlike the first indictment, the second alleged that Burton had received $500 in person in St. Louis. The first indictment alleged only compensated representation, the second indictment also alleged an agreement to do so.|$|E

Goebel opened his campaign on August 12 in Mayfield, {{a city in}} the heavily Democratic Jackson Purchase region of the state.

5000|$|In John 19:7 the Jews cry out to Pontius Pilate [...] "Crucify him" [...] {{based on}} the <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> Jesus [...] "made himself the Son of God." [...] The <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> Jesus had {{declared}} himself [...] "Son of God" [...] was essential to the argument of the Jews from a religious perspective, as the <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> he had called himself King of the Jews was important to Pilate from a political perspective, for it meant possible rebellion against Rome.|$|R
5|$|In October 1913, Tinker and Herrmann conferred, {{leading to}} Tinker signing a {{contract}} to remain the Reds manager for the 1914 season. However, Herrmann fired Tinker in November, leaving him to seek a contract from another team. Tinker complained that Herrmann did not seek his input on player transactions, while Herrmann <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> Tinker did not accept his authority.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Washington {{endorsed}} 18 incumbent aldermen and 5 challengers, including Shiller. Washington {{appeared at}} a joint rally with Shiller at which she announced her candidacy. Kaszak {{was endorsed by}} the Chicago Sun-Times, the Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization (IVI-IPO), the National Organization for Women (NOW), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), and former aldermen William Singer and Dick Simpson. The Chicago Tribune endorsed Orbach. Shiller <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> Orbach catered to developers, displacing people {{in the wake of}} rehabilitation that priced housing {{out of the reach of}} many, and said she wanted community zoning boards, with their decisions binding on the alderman. Shiller <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> most of Orbach's campaign war chest was from developers and regular Democrats outside the ward.|$|E
5|$|To a local reporter, Adidam {{threatened}} to file its own lawsuit against O'Mahoney, {{as well as}} five others who had been named in stories and interviews making allegations of abuse (no suit was ever filed).

50|$|Some feminists {{are opposed}} to pornography, arguing {{that it is an}} {{industry}} which exploits women and is complicit in violence against women, both in its production (where they <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> abuse and exploitation of women performing in pornography is rampant) and in its consumption (where they <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and sexual harassment). They <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> pornography contributes to the male-centered objectification of women and thus to sexism.|$|R

5|$|Wollstonecraft's feminist critics <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> the {{masculine}} role for women that she envisioned—one {{designed for the}} public sphere but which women could not perform in the public sphere—left women without a specific social position. They saw it as ultimately confining and limiting—as offering women more {{in the way of}} education without a real way to use it.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversial}} issue during Desha's tenure was his disdain for Horace Holley, president of Transylvania University. From the time Holley assumed {{the post of}} president in 1818, the university had risen to national prominence and attracted well-qualified and well-respected faculty members such as Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, Daniel Drake, Charles Caldwell, William T. Barry, and Jesse Bledsoe. However, Holley's New England Unitarian beliefs were too liberal for the tastes of many in Kentucky. Many called Holley an infidel and <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> he was a drinker and a gambler. He was criticized for spending time at the horse races and for furnishing his home with nude classical statues.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E

5|$|Before leaving office, Mahathir had {{condemned}} Malays who {{relied on}} their privileges. Abdullah continued this, warning Malays {{to learn to}} live without crutches or end up in wheelchairs. His administration began the practice of meritocracy, which Mahathir had tentatively proposed, and university admissions quotas were eliminated. However, some <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> this did not eliminate discrimination in education. The pre-university stream was divided into two; one course prepared students for the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) standardised examination, lasting two years, while the other comprised various matriculation courses graded by individual lecturers, typically lasting a year.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his 1922 {{re-election}} bid, Barkley was the ranking Democrat on the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. In the election, he carried every First District county, including the Republican strongholds of Caldwell and Crittenden counties. Despite the victory he lacked the political organization needed for higher office. According to Barkley biographer James K. Libbey, the establishment of such an organization, and not necessarily a desire to become governor, may have motivated him to announce his candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on November 11, 1922. Critics <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> this was his intent, and he did little to deny it.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{constitutional}} quirk, Metcalfe's term {{was scheduled to}} begin eight days before the expiration of Desha's. Desha <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> Metcalfe was not allowing him to finish out his term and threatened not to vacate the governor's mansion until his term officially ended. Clark records as legend that, after drinking heavily at a local tavern, Metcalfe {{and some of his}} supporters formed a mob and went to the governor's mansion to evict him by force. Accounts in the local newspapers of the time instead record that the Deshas left the mansion peacefully without intervention by Metcalfe.|$|E

5|$|During {{his final}} months in office, Patton drew {{criticism}} for abusing his patronage power. Critics <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> he had appointed {{several of his}} family and friends who were in non-merit system jobs to merit system positions, increasing their chances of being retained when a new administration took over. These charges were particularly damaging because, earlier in the year, the General Assembly had ordered Patton to cut 800 non-merit positions to help balance the budget. The Lexington Herald-Leader opined that these charges were more serious than those of the Conner affair. Patton maintained that his friends had followed proper personnel protocol in applying for and securing merit positions.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Taylor was {{attacked}} by Democratic opponents because of his party's support from black voters and its ties to big business, including the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. They also <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> Governor Bradley had run a corrupt administration. Republicans answered with charges of factionalism and use of political machinery by Democrats. In particular, they derided the Goebel Election Law, which Taylor claimed subverted {{the will of the}} people.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{said that}} the scariest moment of his career was when he {{attempted}} to pitch while sober in a 1973 game. During pre-game warmups, he could not recreate his pitching mechanics. Ellis went to his locker, took some amphetamines with coffee, and returned to pitch. In August 1973, pictures circulated of Ellis wearing hair curlers in the bullpen during pre-game warmups. The Pirates {{told him not to}} wear curlers on the field again. Ellis agreed, but <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> the Pirates were displaying racism. Ebony devoted a spread to Ellis about his hairstyles, which was inspired by the hair curlers.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Combs {{appointed}} Clements {{as state}} highway commissioner. Some state newspapers <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> Clements had demanded this {{post at the}} head of the state's largest executive department in exchange for supporting Combs, a charge Combs denied. Others wondered if Clements took the post in order to organize the state political machinery for his friend Lyndon Johnson, who was rumored to be considering a run for president. Still others believed that, from his powerful post, Clements would be the real governor and Combs only a puppet.|$|E
5|$|In an {{incident}} {{for which he}} would be widely criticized, McCarthy lobbied for the commutation of death sentences given {{to a group of}} Waffen-SS soldiers convicted of war crimes for carrying out the 1944 Malmedy massacre of American prisoners of war. McCarthy was critical of the convictions because of allegations of torture during the interrogations that led to the German soldiers' confessions. He <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct, but never presented any evidence to support the accusation.|$|E

In 1823, {{he was elected to}} the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for more than a decade. During the 1824 presidential election, he acted as an intermediary between John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Adams' opponent, Andrew Jackson, <b>charged</b> <b>that,</b> through these negotiations, Clay agreed to support Adams for president in exchange for being named Secretary of State.|$|E
