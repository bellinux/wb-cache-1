40|$|In this Letter, we {{demonstrate}} the nanoscale focusing of surface plasmons (SPs) at two different wavelengths {{to the same}} focal plane by a far-field plasmonic lens both numerically and experimentally. The far-field plasmonic lens, which consists of an annular slit and a <b>concentric</b> <b>groove</b> and is capable of focusing dual-wavelength SPs to the same focal plane, {{is characterized by a}} scanning near-field optical microscope under both linearly and radially polarized illuminations. The demonstrated far-field plasmonic lens can provide immense opportunities for on-chip photonic applications, including dual-wavelength-based super-resolution imaging and ultra-high-density optical data storage...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{nanoscale}} focusing of radially {{polarized light}} in far field {{by a simple}} plasmonic lens composed of an annular slit and a single <b>concentric</b> <b>groove</b> is reported. The numerical calculations reveal that the incident light is coupled to surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) by the annular slit and a focal spot with a size less than a half of the illumination wavelength is formed in the far field due to the constructive interference of the scattered light by the groove. More importantly, the focal length can be modulated by changing the groove diameter. This structure provides an admirable choice for the nano-optical devices...|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} <b>concentric</b> <b>grooves,</b> it is {{possible}} to master recordings with two or more separate, interlaced spiral grooves on a side. Such records have occasionally been made as novelties. Victor made one as early as 1901. [...] Depending on where the needle is dropped in the lead-in area, it will catch more or less randomly in one of the grooves. Each groove can contain a different recording, so the record [...] "magically" [...] plays one of several different recordings. Victor marketed a couple of 10-inch 78s with two <b>concentric</b> <b>grooves</b> (called Puzzle Record). Columbia also issued a few 10-inch 78s in 1931 with <b>concentric</b> <b>grooves</b> for their cheap Harmony, Clarion, and Velvet Tone labels. In the blank edge of the record, there was a stamp 'A' and 'B', which indicated where each of the <b>concentric</b> <b>grooves</b> started.|$|R
50|$|Sets of <b>concentric</b> <b>grooves</b> {{that form}} in sand or mud by {{the action of}} sharp objects {{anchored}} {{at the center of a}} curvature set. Most likely formed from some sort of free moving plant under water. Plants are bent by the current, causing them to scratch <b>concentric</b> <b>grooves</b> into the adjacent substrate. The grooves are most likely formed in a muddy substrate, which preserved them during deposition of the overlying sediment. These scratch semicircles can record currents in wind or water during ancient deposition.|$|R

The disc was freely rotating on a thin cushion of air between the disc and a fixed plate at 1500rpm (25 Hz), the disc being stabilized only by centrifugal force. The sampling frequency of the combined audio-video signal was about 2.7 MHz. Maximum video playing time was ten minutes on a 210 mm disc, amounting to about 15,000 <b>concentric</b> <b>grooves</b> on the disc, each storing two half-frame PAL-video-lines.|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Grating-coupling {{phenomena}} between surface plasmons and electromagnetic waves are {{studied in the}} microwave spectrum using metallic circular apertures surrounded by an array of grooves. The measurements are performed in the microwave spectrum of 10 - 18 GHz, corresponding to a wavelength region of 16. 7 - 30 mm.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} study {{investigating the}} effects of both anisotropic and isotropic surface roughness on the convective stability of the boundary-layer flow over a rotating disk is described. Surface roughness is modelled using a partial-slip approach, which yields steady-flow profiles for the relevant velocity components of the boundary-layer flow which are {{a departure from the}} classic von Kármán solution for a smooth disk. These are then subjected to a linear stability analysis to reveal how roughness affects the stability characteristics of the inviscid Type I (or cross-flow) instability and the viscous Type II instability that arise in the rotating disk boundary layer. Stationary modes are studied and both anisotropic (<b>concentric</b> <b>grooves</b> and radial grooves) and isotropic (general) roughness are shown to have a stabilizing effect on the Type I instability. For the viscous Type II instability, it was found that a disk with <b>concentric</b> <b>grooves</b> has a strongly destabilizing effect, whereas a disk with radial grooves or general isotropic roughness has a stabilizing effect on this mode. In order to extract possible underlying physical mechanisms behind {{the effects of}} roughness, and in order to reconfirm the results of the linear stability analysis, an integral energy equation for three-dimensional disturbances to the undisturbed three-dimensional boundary-layer flow is used. For anisotropic roughness, the stabilizing effect on the Type I mode is brought about by reductions in energy production in the boundary layer, whilst the destabilizing effect of <b>concentric</b> <b>grooves</b> on the Type II mode results from a reduction in energy dissipation. For isotropic roughness, both modes are stabilized by combinations of reduced energy production and increased dissipation. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R

40|$|The on-chip {{detection}} of a weak optical signal in biological experiments {{can easily be}} complicated {{by the presence of}} an overwhelming background signal, and as such, pre-detection background suppression is substantively important for weak signal detection. In this paper, we report a structure that can be directly incorporated onto optical sensors to accomplish background suppression prior to detection. This structure, termed surface-wave-enabled darkfield aperture (SWEDA), consists of a central sub-wavelength hole surrounded by <b>concentric</b> <b>grooves</b> that are milled onto a gold layer. Incoming light can be collected and converted into surface waves (SW) by the <b>concentric</b> <b>grooves</b> and then be recoupled into propagating light through the central hole. We show that the SW-assisted optical component and the direct transmission component of the central hole can cancel each other, resulting in near-zero transmission under uniform illumination (observed suppression factor of 1230). This structure can therefore be used to suppress a light field's bright background and allow sensitive {{detection of}} localized light field non-uniformity (observed image contrast enhancement of 27 dB). We also show that under a coherent background illumination, a CMOS pixel patterned with the proposed structure achieves better SNR performance than an un-patterned single pixel...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Monte-Carlo-based {{specialized}} software {{has been applied}} to the statistical modeling of effective emissivity of radiators with <b>concentric</b> <b>grooves</b> of trapezoidal and triangular profile. A specular-diffuse model is used in which the thermal emission from the walls obeys Lambert's cosine law, and reflection may have both specular and diffuse (Lambertian) components. The angular dependences of effective emissivity of a radiator with concentric triangular and trapezoi-dal grooves are computed for various values of the diffuse component. Grooves with isothermal and non-isothermal walls are modeled. It is shown that a temperature drop towards the peak of a groove might lead to substantially decreased effective emissivity. An example of a modeling result for a grooved radiator with reflector enhancement is presented. ...|$|R

30|$|The lens {{concentrated}} the sun irradiance on {{a circular}} spot around 2600 smaller, with a measured transmittance loss of around 11  %. Because the lens {{is made of}} <b>concentric</b> <b>grooves</b> etched in the PMMA material (BHLens 2014; Fresnel Technologies 2014), some spherical aberration was expected. This effect, detrimental for imaging applications, was not as critical for heat-collecting applications where {{the proper design of}} the absorber was paramount. Non-imaging heat collectors, reported to additionally capture diffuse light, would be expected to be more efficient. However, under sunny skies diffuse light constitutes a typically small (10 – 12  %) percentage of the solar energy captured by direct light (NREL radiation database 2014). The small difference in energy captured may be offset by the availability and low cost of the fresnel lens.|$|R
