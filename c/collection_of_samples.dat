5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples.</b> However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E

2500|$|The 12 {{populations are}} {{maintained}} in a [...] incubator in Lenski's laboratory at Michigan State University. Each day, 1% of each population {{is transferred to}} a flask of fresh DM25 growth medium. The dilution means that each population experiences 6.64 generations, or doublings, each day. [...] Large, representative samples of each population are frozen with glycerol as a cryoprotectant at 500-generation (75-day) intervals. The bacteria in these samples remain viable, and can be revived at any time. [...] This <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> {{is referred to as}} the [...] "frozen fossil record", and provides a history of the evolution of each population through the entire experiment. [...] The populations are also regularly screened for changes in mean fitness, and supplemental experiments are regularly performed to study interesting developments in the populations. , the E. coli populations have been under study for over 64,500 generations, and are thought to have undergone enough spontaneous mutations that every possible single point mutation in the E. coli genome has occurred multiple times.|$|E

60|$|It was on March 2nd that Methuen left Vryburg. The {{column was}} not his old one, {{consisting}} of veterans of the trek, but was the Kimberley column under Major Paris, a body of men who had seen much less service and were in every way less reliable. It included a curious mixture of units, the most solid of which were four guns (two of the 4th, {{and two of the}} 38th R.F.A.), 200 Northumberland Fusiliers, and 100 Loyal North Lancashires. The mounted men included 5th Imperial Yeomanry (184), Cape Police (233), Cullinan's Horse (64), 86th Imperial Yeomanry (110), Diamond Fields Horse (92), Dennison' s Scouts (58), Ashburner's Horse (126), and British South African Police (24).

50|$|Up to the present, {{humanity}} {{has collected}} samples of six identified Solar System bodies, {{as well as}} samples of the solar wind. These samples were acquired through three methods: The <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> of Earth itself, the collection of meteorites that have fallen on Earth, and the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> through sample-return missions. Samples of Moon rock from Earth's Moon were collected both from meteorites and through unmanned and manned sample-return missions. The comet Wild 2 and the asteroid 25143 Itokawa were visited by unmanned spacecraft, which returned samples to Earth. Furthermore, samples for three identified Solar System bodies were only collected by means other than sample-return missions: samples from Earth itself, samples from Vesta {{in the form of}} HED meteorites, and samples from Mars in the form of Martian meteorites.|$|E
