40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{capabilities}} of current aerospace lithium-ion cells to perform long-term NASA missions, low-earth-orbits (LEO) testing to evaluate long-term cycle life was initiated. A flexible program was developed at NASA Glenn Research Center to enable assessment of technology developments as they occur {{as well as provide}} information about different cell vendors and cell designs. Following extensive characterization testing, cells are tested using LEO charge and discharge profiles under ten different combinations of test conditions that were statistically chosen {{to determine the effects of}} depth-of-discharge, temperature, and end-of-charge voltage on LEO cycle life. Four cells from each vendor are tested at each specific combination of conditions. Conditions included in the test matrix are depth-of-discharges of 20 %, 30, 35 %, and 40 %; temperatures of 20, 30, and 40 C; and end-of-charge voltages of 3. 85 V, 3. 95 V, and 4. 05 V. Cells are randomly assigned to packs and packs are randomly assigned to test conditions. The capacity of the cells to 3. 0 V at the conditions of the test is being periodically measured. The results of this testing will be used to model cell performance and degradation as a function of test operating conditions. Cells are being evaluated in 4 -cell series strings with charge voltage limits being applied to individual cells by <b>charge</b> <b>control</b> <b>units</b> designed and built at NASA Glenn Research Center.

40|$|WO 200275824 A UPAB: 20030111 NOVELTY - To {{produce an}} adaptronic micro system, {{one or more}} piezo {{electric}} fiber transducers (2) are embedded in a polymer matrix (1), {{with one or more}} <b>control</b> <b>units</b> (3) to <b>control</b> and/or carry signals. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are fitted into the matrix by an initial loose mounting on a surface of a transfer carrier (4). The transfer carrier is applied to the matrix, with the surface fitted with <b>control</b> <b>units</b> towards the transducers, and the transfer carrier is peeled off. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - To produce an adaptronic micro system, the transfer carrier is a film, sheet or plate, with an adhesive bond to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> at a surface, with a weaker bonding than the bond between the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> and the matrix. The bonds are modified to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> more strongly at the matrix. When the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are in place at the matrix, the matrix and/or the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are given an intermediate hardening. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are applied to the transfer carrier by a printing process, ink jet printing or by dispensing. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are electrodes, in an inter-digital array, or of an electrically conductive adhesive applied to the transfer carrier and treated with radiation or heat to give a total or partial hardening action. The transfer carrier, with the control electrodes, is pressed mechanically against the matrix, which is then wholly or partially hardened by radiation or heat. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can be of conductive film or foil materials, conductive lines or network or grid, or of an intrinsic or extrinsic electrically conductive material. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can also be light waveguides. The transducers are piezo electric, magnetostrictive, shape memory alloys or nano tubes. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are applied with a direct contact on the transducers. The control connectors, or connectors which can be fitted, are applied by one or more transfer carriers like the <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> application. The transfer carrier is a polymer film, a sheet of felt paper or coated paper. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are wholly embedded in the matrix. A number of micro systems (5) are assembled into a stack, and then fully hardened by mechanical pressure and heat. USE - The process is for the production of adaptronic micro systems.
