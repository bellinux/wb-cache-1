5|$|Jolliffe's motives {{regarding}} his accusations, {{as well as}} his <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>words,</b> would be questioned for many years afterwards. That would change. In the late 1970s, when David Lewis was doing research for his Memoirs he came across archival evidence proving the charge. Due to Lewis's discovery, Drew's son Edward, placed extremely restrictive conditions on his father's papers housed in the Public Archives of Canada that continue as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|Further, {{he points}} out that the {{language}} used by the Beowulf poet was already archaic, and the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> was at the time recognisably poetic. Tolkien gives as an example beorn, which meant both 'bear' and 'warrior', but only in heroic poetry could it be used to mean 'man'. He advises the translator to prefer 'striking' and 'smiting', and to avoid 'hitting' and 'whacking'. But on the other hand, he criticises William Morris for using the dead and unintelligible 'leeds' for OE leode ('freemen', 'people'; cf German leute), even if antiquarians feel that the word ought to have survived. Tolkien does not accept the etymological fallacy either: mod means 'pride', not 'mood'; burg is 'stronghold', not 'borough', even though the modern word derives from the old one.|$|E

25|$|In {{dialogue}} about this subject, <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> is a sensitive matter.

In this thesis, we explore {{the performance of a}} number of these models, and investigate how they perform using a variety <b>of</b> <b>word</b> representation models. We show that there are large performance differences between word representation models for certain machine learning classifiers, while others are more robust to the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> representation model. We also show that with the right <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> representation model, simple and traditional machine learning classifiers can reach competitive scores even when compared with modern neural network approaches. ...|$|R

25|$|Another {{important}} {{example of}} emergence in web-based systems is social bookmarking (also called collaborative tagging). In social bookmarking systems, users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which {{gives rise to}} a type of information organisation that emerges from this crowdsourcing process. Recent research which analyzes empirically the complex dynamics of such systems has shown that consensus on stable distributions and a simple form of shared vocabularies does indeed emerge, {{even in the absence of}} a central controlled vocabulary. Some believe that this could be because users who contribute tags all use the same language, and they share similar semantic structures underlying the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>words.</b> The convergence in social tags may therefore be interpreted as the emergence of structures as people who have similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information, a process called semantic imitation.|$|E
500|$|Amir's diction depends {{heavily on}} old Malay terms which saw little {{contemporary}} use. He also borrows heavily from other Indonesian languages, particularly Javanese and Sundanes. The <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> {{was influenced by}} the need for rhythm and metre, as well as symbolism related to particular terms. Ultimately, however, Amir is freer in his language use than traditional poets. Indonesian critic Bakri Siregar writes that the result is [...] "a beautiful wordplay".|$|E

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that givenness {{is one of several}} factors that {{influence}} the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> order with the Dative Alternation in languages such as English. This paper investigates to what extent Norwegian {{children between the ages of}} 4; 2 and 6; 0 are sensitive to this factor in production. In order to test this, an experiment was carried out in which the children were prompted to produce structures involving ditransitive verbs when either the Theme or the Recipient was given. The results show that the children are sensitive to the impact of givenness, but while this is expressed through the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> order in Theme-given contexts (yielding the prepositional dative), it is expressed by argument omission in the Recipient-given contexts (resulting in one-argument responses with only the Theme overtly produced) ...|$|R
