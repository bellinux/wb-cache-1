50|$|In {{the form}} known as okoume marine grade plywood, it is {{considered}} perhaps the finest <b>construction</b> <b>plywood</b> now available for boats especially where lighter weight is needed. It is widely available manufactured and certified to British Standard 1088. Its users range from individual hobbyist kayak builders {{to some of the}} world's largest boat builders. Most often it is used in combination with epoxy and fiberglass, the combination giving a structure that can be stronger and lighter than plastic or fiberglass, rivaling the performance characteristics of more advanced composites such as carbon fiber. The grain appearance is prized, likened to that of mahogany and is often varnished for a decorative appearance.|$|E

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} was conventional in layout, high-wing cantilever monoplane, of mixed construction (metal and wood). The fuselage was rectangular in cross-section, {{made of a}} metal frame, covered with metal (upper fuselage) and canvas (sides and bottom), front part was made of duralumin. Wings were of wooden <b>construction,</b> <b>plywood</b> covered. There was a crew of four: pilot, commander-bombardier, radio operator and a rear gunner. The bombardier was accommodated in a glazed nose, with a forward machine gun turret and a significant pointed [...] "beard" [...] below. The pilot's canopy was above a fuselage, offset to the left. The rear gunner operated an upper turret, elevating to a working position. The main undercarriage retracted into engine nacelles. The plane was powered by two Bristol Pegasus VIII radial engines, normal power: 670 hp (500 kW), take-off power: 700 hp (522 kW). Bombs were carried in a bomb bay in the fuselage, the maximum load was 660 kg.|$|E
50|$|Plywood is {{especially}} popular for amateur construction but only marine ply using waterproof glues and even laminates should be used. Cheap <b>construction</b> <b>plywood</b> often has voids {{in the interior}} layers and is not suitable to boat building as the voids trap moisture and accelerate rot as well as physically weaken the plywood. No plywood is rot resistant and should be coated with epoxy resin and/or a good paint system. Varnish and Linseed oil {{should not be used}} on the exterior of a hull for waterproofing. Varnish has about 60% of the water resistance of a good paint system. Only boiled linseed oil should be used on a boat and only in the interior as it has very little water resistance but it is very easy to apply and has a pleasant smell. Note that used linseed rags should not be left in a pile as they can catch fire. A valuable 200-year-old waka (Maori canoe)caught fire in New Zealand in June 2014 when restorers left rags piled overnight. Raw linseed oil is not suited to boats as it stays damp and oily for a long time. Mildew will grow well on raw linseed oil treated timber but not on boiled linseed oil. More recently introduced tropical woods as mahogany, okoumé, iroko, Keruing, azobé and merbau. are also used. With tropical species, extra attention needs to be taken to ensure that the wood is indeed FSC-certified. Teak or iroko is usually used to create the deck and any superstructure. Glue, screws, rivets and/or nails are used to join the wooden components. Before teak is glued the natural oil must be wiped off with a chemical cleaner, otherwise the joint will fail.|$|E
40|$|ADORABLE CHILD OF ITS TIME This text will {{describe}} a inovative project about material, traditions and some ideas about furniture {{for work in}} an home inviroment. The content is partly about exploring ancient marine- and textile techniques to find something useful for furniture of the twenty first century. It is also about the design process of creating a sustainable piece of furniture that questions the paradigmathics about usage and the context about manufacturing furniture. The text will briefly describe the design process and then reason about the result in a deeper sense. Questions that has been considered {{from the very beginning}} of the project as well as those one stumbled across during the evolution of the work will be objectives for the discussion. The result will be in focus as a foundation for the discussion and also the values and issues about that. The concrete result of the process is called “Salabim”. It is a low-technological and flexible place for work or contemplation primly for a home environment. The meeting between our time and the history have influenced the expression but also the desire to create a piece of furniture with acceptable impact towards the eco system. One ambition has been to challenge and question some of our old patterns. Hemp and textile waste have been used together with wood colored with blueberry and chalk. The Salabim concept is a 30 cm high seat and a table adapted for the low, balanced way of sitting, frequently used for meditation. The soft parts have roots in the marine and textile crafts. The table is made of eco-labeled <b>construction</b> <b>plywood</b> and it has simple attachments for accessories for the needs changing over time. The height makes it work well as a bench when not in other use. External partners: Vänerply AB, Claessons Trätjära AB, Beijer Byggmaterial AB, K Palmbla...|$|E
