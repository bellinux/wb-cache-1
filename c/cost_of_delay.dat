Data on proportions <b>of</b> <b>delayed</b> discharges were pooled using a random effects logistic model and the association of relevant factors was assessed. Mean <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>delayed</b> discharge were calculated in USD adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). Results: Of 64 studies included, 52 (81. 3 %) reported delayed discharges as proportions of total hospital stay and 9 (14. 1 %) estimated the respective costs for these <b>delays.</b> Proportions <b>of</b> <b>delayed</b> discharges varied widely, from 1. 6 % to 91. 3 % with a weighted mean of 22. 8 %. This variation was also seen in studies from the same country, for example, in the United Kingdom, they ranged between 1. 6 % and 60. 0 %.

40|$|Abstract. Using an actuarial model, {{we examine}} the delay in credit loan payments. It is assumed that the default arrival process follows the Poisson process and the loss sizes {{are assumed to be}} {{independent}} and identical exponential. We also assume that the delay between default occurrence and partially (or fully) recovered payment is an independent identical exponential random variable. For the recovery rate, we assume that it follows Beta distribution. Using the relationship between the shot noise process and accumulated/discounted aggregate losses process and applying the piecewise deterministic Markov processes theory, we obtain the explicit expressions of the expected value of losses occurred and the expected value of part (or whole) of loan paid with the delay. Based on these first moments, we define and predict the hidden <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in a credit loan portfolio. Numerical examples are also provided based on these explicit expressions of the hidden <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in a credit loan portfolio.
