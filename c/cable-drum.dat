5000|$|During World War II when riders laid field {{telephone}} cable from a <b>cable-drum</b> {{on the back}} of a galloping horse.|$|E
50|$|A 163 ft tall {{headframe}} {{was erected}} over the shaft to operate two hoists, one for ore skips {{and another for}} men and materials, riding in double-decker cages. The hoist cables were fed from massive <b>cable-drum</b> winches located inside two red brick hoist houses situated directly behind the headframe. Nearby was an ore-crushing and screening plant and a plant for pressing the crushed ore into briquettes (built in the 1950s, now demolished). The miners' bath house, designed to accommodate a work force of 500, contained a rack system so that clothes buckets could be suspended out of reach near the ceiling. Other surface works on the 5 acre site included an electrical substation, a lamp house, a compressor house, a machine shop, tool shed, boiler house, pay house and office.|$|E
40|$|The AA at {{an early}} stage of construction, in the newly built AA-Hall. Cable-trays already outline the shape of the {{accumulator}} ring. To the right are huge <b>cable-drums</b> for the pulse-forming-network (PFN) of the injection kicker. Seeing this picture, can one imagine that only 8 months later beams were circulating in the completed accumulator ring...|$|R
