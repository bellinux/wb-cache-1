5|$|Note 2. The fencing {{programme}} included six individual {{events and}} four team events, though the team events were {{a different set}} than were held in 2004. The International Fencing Federation's rules <b>call</b> for events <b>not</b> <b>held</b> in the previous Games to receive automatic selection and {{for at least one}} team event in each weapon to be held. Voting is conducted to determine the fourth event. In 2004, the three men's team events and the women's épée were held. Thus, in 2008, the women's foil and sabre events and men's épée were automatically selected. Men's sabre was chosen over foil by a 45–20 vote.|$|R
5000|$|On April 20, Macalintal {{and fellow}} lawyer Antonio Carlos Bautista {{questioned}} {{the legality of}} the special election [...] "because it will be held beyond the period as provided for by law." [...] They argued that since Arroyo died on January 25, and that a special election [...] "shall be <b>called</b> and <b>held</b> <b>not</b> earlier than 60 days nor longer than 90 days after the occurrence of the vacancy," [...] the period of time when the election can be held is between March 25 and April 25.|$|R
40|$|We study call {{admission}} {{rates in}} a linear communication network with each call identified by an arrival time, duration, bandwidth requirement, and origin-destination pair. Network links {{all have the}} same bandwidth capacity, and a call can be admitted only if there is sufficient bandwidth available on every link along the <b>call's</b> path. <b>Calls</b> <b>not</b> admitted are <b>held</b> in a queue, in contrast to the protocol of loss networks. We determine maximum admission rates (capacities) under greedy call allocation rules such as First Fit and Best Fit for several base-case models, and prove that the natural necessary condition for stability is sufficient. We establish the close connections between our new problems and the classical problems of bin packing and interval packing. In view of these connections, it is surprising to find that Best Fit allocation policies are inferior to First Fit policies in the models studied. 1 Introduction An effective, easily implemented call admission policy is a key eleme [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|At {{the funeral}} {{service of a}} noble General Authority, H. Verlan Andersen, a tribute was {{expressed}} by a son. He related that, years earlier, he had a special school date on a Saturday night. He borrowed from his father the family car. As he obtained the car keys {{and headed for the}} door, his father said, “Remember, tomorrow is Sunday. The car will need more gas before then. Be sure to fill the tank before coming home.”Elder Andersen’s son then related that the evening activity was wonderful. Friends met, refreshments were served, and all had a good time. In his exuberance, however, he failed to follow his father’s instruction and add fuel to the car’s tank before returning home. He simply forgot.Sunday morning dawned. Elder Andersen discovered the gas gauge showed empty. The son saw his father put the car keys on the table. In the Andersen family the Sabbath day was a day for worship and thanksgiving, and not for purchases.As the funeral message continued, Elder Andersen’s son declared, “I saw my father put on his coat, bid us good-bye, and walk the long distance to the chapel, that he might attend an early meeting.” Duty <b>called.</b> Truth was <b>not</b> <b>held</b> hostage to expedience.In concluding his funeral message, Elder Andersen’s son said, “No son ever was taught more effectively by his father than I was on that occasion. My father not only knew the truth, but he also taught the truth and lived the truth.” ...|$|R
