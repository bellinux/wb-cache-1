50|$|The {{difference}} between a <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreement</b> and a browsewrap agreement {{is that in a}} browsewrap agreement, the visitor to a site accepts the terms of service simply by visiting the website.|$|E
5000|$|I. Lan Sys., Inc. v. Netscout Serv. Level Corp., 183 F. Supp. 2d 328, 336 (D. Mass. 2002) (upholding a <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreement</b> on two grounds: first, clickwrap {{is simply}} [...] "Money now, terms later" [...] {{contract}} formation; second, {{the court found}} that the [...] "additional terms" [...] of the clickwrap license was not material under UCC (§207(2)(b)).|$|E
5000|$|The court {{concluded}} that subscribers who click [...] "yes" [...] to the Terms of Use Agreement indicate assent via E-sign.However, the court gave {{no comment on}} whether such assent would constitute a valid agreement in this appeal to preliminary injunction; therefore, the validity MRIS's copyright transfer might need to further be solved in its merit claims. Whether the accepting in a <b>Clickwrap</b> <b>Agreement</b> should be interpreted that the user consented to transfer his own right is still a controversial issue. In a practical way, it might have to consider if the user is forced to click yes to the <b>Clickwrap</b> <b>Agreement.</b> If so, it might be clearer if the website would use both the clicking to the Term of Use and the signing to assent to transfer the user's right to the website. It should {{be interesting to see}} how other courts would decide this same issue.|$|E
40|$|Courts {{reviewing}} the enforceability of <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreements</b> have relied upon the case law surrounding shrinkwrap cases in formulating their decisions. The author {{concludes that the}} legal reasoning behind the various clickwrap decisions has been relatively consistent, despite arguments made to the contrary. The author also asserts that <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreements</b> are a legitimate form of contracting, and that objections to clickwrap are similar to objections {{to other forms of}} contracts...|$|R
5000|$|The {{content and}} form of <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreements</b> vary widely. Most <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreements</b> require the {{end-user}} to [...] {{his or her}} [...] by clicking an [...] "ok" [...] or [...] "agree" [...] button on a dialog box or pop-up window. A user indicates [...] by clicking cancel or closing the window. Upon rejection, the user cannot use or purchase the product or service. Classically, such a take-it-or-leave-it contract {{was described as a}} [...] "contract of adhesion, which is a contract that lacks bargaining power, forcing one party to be favored over the other".|$|R
5000|$|In its {{analysis}} {{of whether the}} arbitration agreement was valid, the court first differentiated between two contracts commonly formed on the Internet - <b>clickwrap</b> and browsewrap <b>agreements.</b> <b>Clickwrap</b> <b>agreements</b> were formed when users were required to affirmatively click an [...] "I agree" [...] checkbox after being presented with the website's terms. Browsewrap agreements, conversely, required no consent checkbox. Instead, for browsewrap agreements the terms needed only be posted via a hyperlink {{at the bottom of}} the page and the user would consent to the agreement by using the website. [...] Following this definition, the court classified the Barnes & Noble terms as a browsewrap agreement.|$|R
5000|$|Even though {{courts have}} ruled some clickwrap {{licenses}} {{to be enforceable}} contracts, {{it does not follow}} that every term of every clickwrap license is enforceable. Clickwrap licenses must still meet the criteria for enforceability of a unilateral form contract. For example, see Bragg v. Linden Research, Inc., 487 F.Supp.2d 593 (E.D. Pa. 2007), in which the judge found certain aspects of the Second Life <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreement</b> [...] "unconscionable, and therefore unenforceable."http://pub.bna.com/eclr/064925_053007.pdf ...|$|E
5000|$|From the {{decision}} in this case, by clicking [...] "yes" [...] to the <b>Clickwrap</b> <b>Agreement,</b> a user could agree to transfer his copyright to the websites, other than his intent {{to agree with the}} term of use. This could establish some new considerations for practitioners dealing with copyright matters. [...] As more transactions become entirely electronic in nature, it is likely that more courts will join the Fourth Circuit in holding that clicks and taps can constitute signed writings in general business as well as specifically in the copyright context.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>clickwrap</b> <b>{{agreement}}</b> (also {{known as}} a [...] "clickthrough" [...] agreement or clickwrap license) is a common type of agreement often used in connection with software licenses. Such forms of agreement are mostly found on the Internet, {{as part of the}} installation process of many software packages, or in other circumstances where agreement is sought using electronic media. The name [...] "clickwrap" [...] came from the use of [...] "shrink wrap contracts" [...] commonly used in boxed software purchases, which [...] "contain a notice that by tearing open the shrinkwrap, the user assents to the software terms enclosed within".|$|E
5000|$|Browse-wrap <b>agreements,</b> like <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreements,</b> {{derive their}} name by analogy to the [...] "shrink wrap agreements" [...] {{included}} inside the sealed packaging of tangible products, {{where one can}} not see the agreement until the product has been purchased or used. [...] Courts that have ruled on the issue have held that the validity of a browse-wrap agreement primarily depends on whether a website user has actual or constructive notice of the terms and conditions prior to using the website or other product.|$|R
40|$|Judge Easterbrook of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit {{has become}} an {{unlikely}} force in software licensing issues. His application of law and economics has benefited consumers and promulgated software innovation. In upholding <b>clickwrap</b> licensing <b>agreements</b> {{within the context of}} copyright law, the floodgates were opened for sister circuits to do the same. Judge Easterbrook later applied this reasoning and further advanced his policies in a case about an 2 ̆ 2 in the box 2 ̆ 2 warranty of a computer purchase. Through this jurisprudence, open source software has flourished and thrived, largely through <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreements.</b> The benefits to consumers and to society from open source are substantial, as it is a worthy alternative to the traditional commercial software model. Recently, the court recognized these benefits in striking down an antitrust challenge to the open source model. The application of law and economics to software licensing issues has resulted in a positive outcome for consumers: an outcome that promotes innovation in the best sense of the Copyright Act and competition in the best sense of antitrust laws...|$|R
50|$|Microsystems Software, Inc. v. Scandinavia Online AB is a 2000 US District Court civil case, {{numbered}} 00-cv10488-EFH, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. It received {{considerable attention}} in the online community because it involved reverse engineering and cryptanalysis of content-control software, allegedly in violation of copyright law and a <b>clickwrap</b> license <b>agreement.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Browse-wrap (also Browserwrap or browse-wrap license) is a {{term used}} in Internet law {{to refer to a}} {{contract}} or license agreement covering access to or use of materials on a web site or downloadable product. In a browse-wrap agreement, the terms and conditions of use for a website or other downloadable product are posted on the website, typically as a hyperlink {{at the bottom of the}} screen. Unlike a <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreement,</b> where the user must manifest assent to the terms and conditions by clicking on an [...] "I agree" [...] box, a browse-wrap agreement does not require this type of express manifestation of assent. Rather, a web-site user purportedly gives his or her assent by simply using the product — such as by entering the website or downloading software.|$|E
5000|$|Approving of the ruling, Tickets.com's lawyer Danniel Harris said, [...] "It is significant, not so {{much for}} the dismissals, but in the time and care put into the {{underlying}} issues". Author-attorney Jacqueline Klosek wrote that the Ticketmaster case provided strong evidence for how websites should avoid placing a link to their terms and conditions page {{at the bottom of the}} homepage if they wanted the terms and conditions to pass legal muster. She recommended that websites use a <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreement</b> and if that proved problematic, websites ought to place a link to the terms and conditions page at a prominent location. The Registers Thomas C. Greene speculated that the lawsuit was filed because there was no law mandating that consumers must view their advertisements. He said that [...] "perhaps an Act of Congress is in order to rectify this glaring omission in the American legal system".|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{contractual}} arrangements have raised complex legal issues unprecedented in the law. Technology s impact on traditional contract law doctrines is readily {{apparent in the}} dilemmas generated by recent developments in computer software, hardware, and Internet transactions. In such transactions, sellers have increasingly begun utilizing “clickwrap” agreements, whereby standard terms and conditions are displayed {{on the computer screen}} when the user attempts to access the seller’s services. Not surprisingly, the enforceability of clickwrap terms, which are often not known to the user until after payment, has become a subject of much debate in the courts. Because many of the clickwrap cases have been fact-based decisions with seemingly contradictory conclusions, various scholarly and academic writings have pointed out the need for a heightened degree of certainty concerning the enforceability of clickwrap. The aim of this note is to provide clarity to the clickwrap debate and to argue that the legal reasoning behind the various clickwrap decisions has, in fact, been relatively consistent. More importantly, this note illustrates that <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreements</b> are a legitimate form of contracting, and that objections to clickwrap are substantially no different from objections to most other forms of contracts...|$|R
5000|$|On April Fools' Day 2010, Gamestation {{temporarily}} added {{a clause}} to its online sales contract claiming that [...] "By placing an order via this Web {{site on the}} first day of the fourth month of the year 2010 Anno Domini, you agree to grant Us a non transferable option to claim, for now and for ever more, your immortal soul." [...] Besides the humorous reference to a deal with the devil, the prank was meant to illustrate the problems with fine print in <b>clickwrap</b> license <b>agreements</b> that allow companies to hide unfavourable conditions from their consumers.|$|R
5000|$|Although, section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 45) grants the FTC {{power to}} {{investigate}} and prevent deceptive trade practices, this decision {{came as a surprise}} to a number of legal observers. SMHC probably thought it was doing everything legally required to use its application to collect detailed information on consumers. Courts have frequently found that terms buried within licensee agreements are enforceable—even when the terms are in small print in text boxes like the ones in the SMHC case. [...] Often referred to as <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreements,</b> in these cases courts have found that by clicking “I accept" [...] users became legally bound by all of the terms of the licensee agreement even if they did not read them. Contractually, companies are usually free to create whatever terms they want {{as long as they are}} disclosed in legalese somewhere in the licensee agreement or terms of use. The FTC has indicated through this case that while this fiction may be adequate to form a contract, it is not adequate to avoid deceptive practices. Unread agreements do not relieve companies of their duty not to deceive consumers by omitting material terms. The ruling suggests that companies have a duty to appropriately set consumer expectations and they cannot rely upon the fiction that users have read license agreements. Rather, if a company’s application or website collects information or behaves in ways that consumers would not expect, the company has a duty to inform the consumer of what the application or website does.|$|R
50|$|Courts {{in various}} jurisdictions {{have decided that}} {{enforceable}} electronic signatures can include agreements made by email, entering a personal identification number (PIN) into a bank ATM, signing a credit or debit slip with a digital pen pad device (an application of graphics tablet technology) at a point of sale, installing software with a <b>clickwrap</b> software license <b>agreement</b> on the package, and signing electronic documents online.|$|R
40|$|As {{copyright}} {{issues have}} moved towards {{the forefront of}} popular culture, trade, and the Supreme Court docket, we have {{lost sight of the}} first principles framed copyright’s development. This article reviews and identifies legal and conceptual framework that serves as the legal foundation for recognition of copyright and the social basis for acceptance of copyright by the general public. The article discusses the basis for legitimacy of copyright. The article explores various theoretical underpinnings of copyright, critiques the more recent approaches to copyright, assessing copyright as an intangible and as a natural right, reviews the traditional economic and incentive-based rationales for copyright, and analyzes the conceptual philosophical framework that shapes the policies underlying copyright. Building on the core fundamentals identified in the earlier sections and suggests some steps necessary to reorient each of the three primary building blocks for normative acceptance of copyright – social contract, technology, and law. The outcome of the research indicates that the intangible nature of copyright does not govern the public’s respect – or lack of respect – for copyright. Similarly, the natural rights approach to copyright used in Europe, while a sound basis for copyright protection, does not provide any guidance on how copyright laws should be drafted. I return to the constitutional incentive of copyright which requires that copyright is granted to promote progress of science and the useful arts. Instead of interpreting this in a narrow, economic fashion, however, I suggest that the more proper balance is that which has been articulated by the Supreme Court since 1879, that expression is protected so that authors will develop new facts and ideas for the betterment of the public, and apply this approach to issues involving <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreements,</b> fair use, reverse engineering, and peer-to-peer file sharing...|$|R
40|$|This Note {{argues that}} the state of a modern {{consumer}} society, when evaluated against the culture of marketing and consumerism surrounding America’s youth, calls for persisting protection of children in contract formation through retention of the infancy defense. Part II of this Note introduces the infancy defense, the philosophy behind it, the various exceptions to the defense, and how these exceptions have adapted to the modern marketplace to assure equitable results for adults. This Part also discusses other arenas of the law in which children are afforded special protection. Part III addresses {{the current state of the}} infancy doctrine as demonstrated in the 2008 Virginia case A. V. v. iParadigms, in which the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia dismissed high school students’ attempts to disaffirm an online contract under the infancy defense, holding that the plaintiffs could not disaffirm because they had retained the benefits of the contract. Part IV replies to the predominant arguments against the infancy doctrine and explains why equitable concerns about the infancy defense’s impact on adults are unwarranted. Part V examines the ongoing relevancy of the infancy defense in light of technological advancements, suggesting ways in which minors continue to be vulnerable to more sophisticated adults and businesses. This includes a discussion of the commercialization of childhood and the ways in which marketing companies target children in order to further the prevalence of materialism, consumer debt, and the earn-and-spend lifestyle. This Part also discusses the types of agreements that are prevalent online, such as adhesion contracts and <b>clickwrap</b> <b>agreements,</b> and argues that young people are particularly incompetent to consent to these forms of contracts. Finally, Part VI concludes with the contention that the infancy defense is still important and should be retained with its current exceptions...|$|R
5000|$|On March 15, Microsystems Software, the {{publisher}} of Cyber Patrol, and Mattel, its parent company, filed suit against Jansson, Skala, and the ISPs that hosted their personal Web sites, Scandinavia Online and Islandnet. They filed in US court, though Jansson and Scandinavia Online were located in Sweden and Skala and Islandnet were located in Canada. They alleged that the reverse engineering was copyright infringement by Jansson and Skala; that distributing the essay and software (or, {{in the case of}} Islandnet, the link on Skala's site pointing to the essay and software on Jansson's site) was copyright infringement by the ISPs; and that Jansson and Skala's actions constituted breach of the <b>clickwrap</b> license <b>agreement</b> on Cyber Patrol, interference with advantageous business relations, conversion, and theft of trade secrets. http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/lawpoli/youthrights/cpbfaq.php#whatclaims Once the lawsuit became known, it attracted considerable attention from the online community, far overshadowing the discussion of the reverse engineering itself. https://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,34998,00.html ...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{starts with}} the famous 2 ̆ 2 horse trades 2 ̆ 2 (typically between A and B and for 10 £) from early discussions of {{contract}} law, and proceeds through Judge Burrough 2 ̆ 7 s enduring 2 ̆ 2 unruly horse 2 ̆ 2 and Karl Llewellyn 2 ̆ 7 s Across Sales on Horseback and The First Struggle to Unhorse Wares, to provide background for {{a critique of the}} recent judicial liberality in enforcing online contracts. We then focus on role of Judge Frank Easterbrook, who has personally insulted the place of the horse in law, and his infamous opinion in ProCD v. Zeidenberg. This case fueled the enforcement of clickwrap and browsewrap contracts by decaying assent and notice requirements that once anticipated a more cognizant approach to contracting. Further, it has engendered applications expanded far beyond what was required by the facts. We next examine the contract formation process of eight significant online service providers, illustrating the range of opacity in the act of contracting and the notice given for online terms. We ground these illustrations by including a sampling of some of their more onerous provisions. Finally, we survey courts 2 ̆ 7 handling of <b>clickwrap</b> andbrowsewrap <b>agreements</b> in the last several years. We conclude generally that, as the years pass, the particulars of judicial analysis and case precedent get muddled andthe nuances lost, and later courts sometimes pick up a partial idea or rule and forget its context, justifications, and penumbra. One might say they adopt half a horse, andwe argue that the half of contract law modern courts have adopted is not the front half...|$|R
