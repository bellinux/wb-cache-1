25|$|Direct contact {{membrane}} distillation (DCMD). Applicable to desalination. Heated seawater is passed along {{the surface of}} a hydrophobic polymer membrane. Evaporated water passes from the hot side through pores in the membrane into a stream of cold pure water on the other side. The difference in vapour pressure between the hot and <b>cold</b> <b>side</b> helps to push water molecules through.|$|E
25|$|When {{one side}} of the piston is open to the atmosphere, the {{operation}} is slightly different. As the sealed volume of working gas comes in contact with the hot side, it expands, doing work on both the piston and on the atmosphere. When the working gas contacts the <b>cold</b> <b>side,</b> its pressure drops below atmospheric pressure and the atmosphere pushes on the piston and does work on the gas.|$|E
25|$|A {{dehumidification}} chamber {{can be an}} unvented system (closed loop) or {{a partially}} vented system which uses a heat pump to condense moisture from the air using <b>cold</b> <b>side</b> of the refrigeration process (evaporator.) The heat thus gathered {{is sent to the}} hot side of the refrigeration process (condenser) to re-heat the air and returns this drier and warmer air inside the kiln. Fans blow the air through the piles as in a normal kiln. These kilns traditionally operate from 100°F to 160°F and use about half the energy of a conventional kiln.|$|E

25|$|A {{thermocouple}} {{can produce}} current to drive some processes directly, {{without the need}} for extra circuitry and power sources. For example, the power from a thermocouple can activate a valve when a temperature difference arises. The electrical energy generated by a thermocouple is converted from the heat which must be supplied to the hot side to maintain the electric potential. A continuous transfer of heat is necessary because the current flowing through the thermocouple tends to cause the hot side to cool down and the <b>cold</b> <b>side</b> to heat up (the Peltier effect).|$|E

2500|$|A {{planetary}} {{object that}} orbits a star with high orbital eccentricity may spend {{only some of}} its year in the CHZ and experience a large variation in temperature and atmospheric pressure. This would result in dramatic seasonal phase shifts where liquid water may exist only intermittently. It is possible that subsurface habitats could be insulated from such changes and that extremophiles {{on or near the}} surface might survive through adaptions such as hibernation (cryptobiosis) and/or hyperthermostability. Tardigrades, for example, can survive in a dehydrated state temperatures between [...] and [...] Life on a planetary object orbiting outside CHZ might hibernate on the <b>cold</b> <b>side</b> as the planet approaches the apastron where the planet is coolest and become active on approach to the periastron when the planet is sufficiently warm.|$|E

40|$|A novel cleaner {{production}} technology (CPT) using {{waste heat}} for pure water production {{was established by}} integration of direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) and traditional recirculating cooling water (RCW) process. The effect of temperature difference and flow rate of fluid between the hot and <b>cold</b> <b>sides</b> in a membrane module on the membrane flux was investigated. The {{results of the study}} show that the membrane flux increases with an increase in the flow rate in both hot and <b>cold</b> <b>sides</b> and also increases linearly with the increase in fluid temperature difference between the hot and <b>cold</b> <b>sides</b> of the membrane module. Waste heat was utilized for pure water production, which will reduce the pure water production cost. The employment of DCMD in the RCW process may also reduce the amount of scale and corrosion inhibition additives needed in the CPT, the makeup water and blowdown quantity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

2500|$|It is {{essential}} that the refrigerant reach a sufficiently high temperature, when compressed, to release heat through the [...] "hot" [...] heat exchanger (the condenser). Similarly, the fluid must reach a sufficiently low temperature when allowed to expand, or else heat cannot flow from the ambient cold region into the fluid in the cold heat exchanger (the evaporator). In particular, the pressure difference must be great enough for the fluid to condense at the hot side and still evaporate in the lower pressure region at the <b>cold</b> <b>side.</b> The greater the temperature difference, the greater the required pressure difference, and consequently the more energy needed to compress the fluid. Thus, as with all heat pumps, the coefficient of performance (amount of thermal energy moved per unit of input work required) decreases with increasing temperature difference.|$|E

60|$|And {{as there}} are many Hiram Yorkes in the world, it is well that the true poet, quiet {{externally}} though he may be, has often a truculent spirit under his placidity, and is full of shrewdness in his meekness, and can measure the whole stature of those who look down on him, and correctly ascertain the weight and value of the pursuits they disdain him for not having followed. It is happy that he can have his own bliss, his own society with his great friend and goddess Nature, quite independent of those who find little pleasure in him, and in whom he finds no pleasure at all. It is just that while the world and circumstances often turn a dark, <b>cold</b> <b>side</b> to him--and properly, too, because he first turns a dark, cold, careless side to them--he {{should be able to}} maintain a festal brightness and cherishing glow in his bosom, which makes all bright and genial for him; while strangers, perhaps, deem his existence a Polar winter never gladdened by a sun. The true poet is not one whit to be pitied, and he is apt to laugh in his sleeve when any misguided sympathizer whines over his wrongs. Even when utilitarians sit in judgment on him, and pronounce him and his art useless, he hears the sentence with such a hard derision, such a broad, deep, comprehensive, and merciless contempt of the unhappy Pharisees who pronounce it, that he is rather to be chidden than condoled with. These, however, are not Mr. Yorke's reflections, and it is with Mr. Yorke we have at present to do.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with all}} heat engines, the {{efficiency}} of a wave disk engine is governed by the temperature difference between the hot and <b>cold</b> <b>sides</b> (see Carnot's theorem). Compared to a conventional piston engine (reciprocating engine), a wave disk engine works at higher peak temperature, which theoretically makes it more efficient. The design also works without a cooling system, saving weight. Compared to turbine based systems, the rotational speed and the rotor-blade temperature of the wave disk engine is lower, which creates lower stress on materials, and consequently less demanding requirements for materials, leading to cheaper manufacturing and maintenance costs.|$|R
