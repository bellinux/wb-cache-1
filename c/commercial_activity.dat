5|$|In modern times, <b>commercial</b> <b>{{activity}}</b> {{shifted from}} the major trade routes of the Old World to newer routes between modern nation-states. This activity was sometimes carried out without traditional protection of trade and under international free-trade agreements, which allowed commercial goods to cross borders with relaxed restrictions. Innovative transportation of modern times includes pipeline transport and the relatively well-known trade involving rail routes, automobiles, and cargo airlines.|$|E

5|$|Direct trade {{links between}} the Mediterranean lands and India had been {{established}} in the late 2nd century BC by the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. Greek navigators learned to use the regular pattern of the monsoon winds for their trade voyages in the Indian Ocean. The lively sea trade in Roman times is confirmed by the excavation of large deposits of Roman coins along much of the coast of India. Many trading ports with links to Roman communities {{have been identified in}} India and Sri Lanka along the route used by the Roman mission. Archaeological evidence stretching from the Red Sea ports of Roman Egypt to India suggests that Roman <b>commercial</b> <b>activity</b> in the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia declined heavily with the Antonine Plague of 166 AD, the same year as the first Roman embassy to Han China, where similar plague outbreaks had occurred from 151 AD.|$|E
5|$|During the Tudor {{period the}} Reformation {{produced}} a gradual shift to Protestantism, {{and much of}} London passed from church to private ownership. Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries, where it was considered indispensable. But the reach of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England {{were likely to be}} Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of <b>commercial</b> <b>activity.</b> The Royal Exchange was founded. Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we use tereke records of Manisa and Kayseri, and compare wealth {{distributions}} between 1700 - 1720 and 1780 - 1800 periods. We first checked whether rise in wealth of non-Muslims was {{more significant than}} of Muslims in both cities. We found that in Manisa, as is expected because it had strong commercial relationship with Europe, non-Muslims economically improved more than Muslims. However, a rapid economic decline of non-Muslims is observed in Kayseri. Then we tried to examine <b>commercial</b> <b>activities</b> of Muslims and non-Muslims through commercial properties in the tereke records. We observed that <b>commercial</b> <b>activities</b> of non-Muslims also expanded in comparison with <b>commercial</b> <b>activities</b> of Muslims in Manisa, and <b>commercial</b> <b>activities</b> of non-Muslims reduced in Kayseri. Therefore we rejected the claim {{that there was a}} general ascendance of non-Muslims in the 18 th century. Non- Muslims seem to develop only in regions which had strong commercial relationship with Europe, but in regions like Kayseri, where domestic trade was strong, both general wealth level and vitality of <b>commercial</b> <b>activities</b> of non-Muslims left behind Muslims...|$|R

5|$|Historically each {{neighborhood}} of Ashdod {{had its own}} commercial center. In 1990, however, when the mall shopping culture developed in Israel, the main <b>commercial</b> <b>activity</b> in Ashdod moved to malls. The first mall to open in Ashdod was the Forum Center in the industrial zone. Restaurants, bars and night clubs were opened in the area. Today, the Forum center is mainly used for offices. Lev Ashdod Mall, which opened in 1993, has been enlarged and upgraded since then. Ashdod Mall, billed {{at the time as}} the city's largest shopping mall, has also been redesigned since its opening in 1995. City Mall, Ashdod was opened in a combined building with the central bus station in 1996, following the examples of the Tel Aviv Central Bus Station and the Jerusalem Central Bus Station. The Sea Mall, a three-story mall near the government offices, has a climbing wall and movie theater. Star Center doubled in size in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Looms {{were not}} {{controlled}} by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their <b>commercial</b> <b>activity</b> was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported. The entrepreneur was {{in direct contact with}} the patron, and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by Colart de Laon having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{resettlement}} of Svalbard in {{the early}} 20th century, coal mining has been the dominant <b>commercial</b> <b>activity.</b> Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, {{a subsidiary of the}} Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry, operates Svea Nord in Sveagruva and Mine 7 in Longyearbyen. The former produced 3.4 million tonnes in 2008, while the latter uses 35% of its output to Longyearbyen Power Station. Since 2007, there has not been any significant mining by the Russian state-owned Arktikugol in Barentsburg. There have previously been performed test drilling for petroleum on land, but these did not give satisfactory results for permanent operation. The Norwegian authorities do not allow offshore petroleum activities for environmental reasons, and the land formerly test-drilled on has been protected as natural reserves or national parks. In 2011, a 20-year plan to develop offshore oil and gas resources around Svalbard was announced.|$|E

5|$|Statistics on {{injuries}} {{related to}} commercial diving are normally collected by national regulators. In the UK the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) {{is responsible for}} the overview of about 5,000 commercial divers; in Norway the corresponding authority is the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA), which has maintained the DSYS database since 1985, gathering statistics on over 50,000 diver-hours of <b>commercial</b> <b>activity</b> per year. The risks of dying during recreational, scientific or commercial diving are small, and for scuba diving, deaths are usually associated with poor gas management, poor buoyancy control, equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error {{on the part of the}} victim. According to a North American 1972 analysis of calendar year 1970 data, diving was, based on man hours, 96 times more dangerous than driving a car. According to a 2000 Japanese study, every hour of recreational diving is 36 to 62 times riskier than driving.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch Empire {{held the}} Dutch Cape Colony, Dutch Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies. The latter, now Indonesia, was {{governed by the}} Dutch East India Company from the highly lucrative port of Batavia. Batavia was the centre of East Asian trade, {{reaching}} as far as Nagasaki in Edo period Japan, supported by other towns and ports including Sourabaya and Griessie. The Cape Colony at the Southern tip of Africa was far less significant, acting principally as a resupply harbour with little <b>commercial</b> <b>activity</b> or penetration into the surrounding countryside. The commercially significant harbours of Trincomalee and Colombo {{on the island of}} Ceylon were of strategic importance, but weakly garrisoned against attack. These colonies were defended by a Dutch naval squadron, sent to the region in 1782 {{in the aftermath of the}} American War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|The whaling {{industry}} {{peaked in}} 1857, when New Bedford accounted {{for half the}} U.S. fleet. Growing competition from the new petroleum industry, {{and the impact of}} the Civil War, ensured that it would not recover as it had in the past. The Bethel was rebuilt after an 1867 fire, with a new exterior and an added tower. The NBIS building became a local courthouse, and the center of <b>commercial</b> <b>activity</b> in New Bedford moved west, where it has remained, as textiles became the city's dominant industry. The whaling museum was established in one of the old buildings in 1907. But ships lost at sea were not replaced as they had been before, and in 1927, the John R. Mantra made the last whaling voyage from the city and the last in American history.|$|E

5|$|There {{are various}} {{important}} prehistoric structures, {{many of which}} pre-date the first written references to the islands by Roman and Greek authors. The Western Isles {{became part of the}} Norse kingdom of the , which lasted for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. Control of the islands was then held by clan chiefs, principal of whom were the MacLeods, MacDonalds, Mackenzies and MacNeils. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities and it is only in recent years that population levels have ceased to decline. Much of the land is now under local control and <b>commercial</b> <b>activity</b> is based on tourism, crofting, fishing, and weaving.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} decades, Singapore grew {{to become an}} important port in the region. Its success was due to several reasons including {{the opening of the}} Chinese market, the advent of ocean-going steamships, the dramatic reduction in the time and cost of shipping goods to Europe after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, and the production of rubber and tin in Malaya. Its status as a free port provided a crucial advantage over other colonial port cities in Batavia (now Jakarta) and Manila where tariffs were levied, and it drew many Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Arab traders operating in South-East Asia to Singapore. The later opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 would further boost trade in Singapore. By 1880, over 1.5 million tons of goods were passing through Singapore each year, with around 80% of the cargo transported by steamships. The main <b>commercial</b> <b>activity</b> was entrepôt trade which flourished under no taxation and little restriction. Many merchant houses were set up in Singapore mainly by European trading firms, but also by Jewish, Chinese, Arab, Armenian, American and Indian merchants. There were also many Chinese middlemen who handled most of the trade between the European and Asian merchants.|$|E
5|$|Native Hawaiians {{before the}} arrival of Captain Cook in 1770 used no coins; trade in their {{agricultural}} economy was based on barter. Early relations between Hawaiians and explorers were also based on barter, with nails, beads, and small pieces of iron sometimes being used as money, but as more systematic foreign trade began {{at the turn of the}} 19th century, coins of many lands came to the islands as payment for exports. The arrival of the missionaries, and the plantations and other <b>commercial</b> <b>activity</b> that soon followed, led to the first currencies generated by the islands: tokens and scrip used to pay workers because of the chronic shortage of small change. The trade ties and cultural connections with the United States led the early Hawaii business community to think in terms of the US dollar, and it became the basis for trade, with the Hawaiian royal government periodically publishing tables of the value of non-US coins in terms of the dollar. This was necessary because such coins, brought to the islands by foreign trade, circulated as a means of exchange alongside American silver and gold pieces.|$|E
