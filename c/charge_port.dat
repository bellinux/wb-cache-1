5|$|USB Battery Charging {{defines a}} new <b>port</b> type, the <b>charging</b> <b>port,</b> {{as opposed to}} the {{standard}} downstream port (SDP) of the base specification. <b>Charging</b> <b>ports</b> are divided into 2 further types: the <b>charging</b> downstream <b>port</b> (CDP), which has data signals, and the dedicated <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> (DCP), which does not. Dedicated <b>charging</b> <b>ports</b> can be found on USB power adapters that convert utility power or another power source (e.g., a car's electrical system) to run attached devices and battery packs. On a host (such as a laptop computer) with both standard and <b>charging</b> USB <b>ports,</b> the <b>charging</b> <b>ports</b> should be labeled as such.|$|R
5|$|ACAs {{have three}} ports: the OTG port for the {{portable}} device, which {{is required to}} have a Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the accessory port, which is required to have a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the <b>charging</b> <b>port,</b> which is required to have a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, but to the ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> does not pass data, but does use the DÂ± signals for <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> detection. The accessory port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the portable device can charge from the bus power {{as if there were}} a <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the portable device via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the accessory <b>port</b> from the <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> transparently.|$|R

25|$|The <b>charge</b> <b>port</b> area {{now comes}} with a light not {{provided}} on earlier models, {{and the ability to}} open the port door from inside the car or by using the key fob. The onboard charger in all 2013 Leafs has also been reduced in size and relocated to a new position under the hood, which increases cargo volume. The new base trim level is called the Leaf S model, and {{is the result of a}} strategy for affordability. The S trim replaces the LED headlights with less expensive projector beams, and uses 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers rather than alloy wheels. The base trim does not include the navigation system and the remote connectivity that allows drivers to turn on the climate control and monitor battery charging remotely using a smartphone. LED headlamps, fog lights, 17-inch alloy wheels and leather seating, are reserved for the higher-end SL trim. Additional premium upgrades to the SL trim include a Bose seven-speaker audio system and around view monitor, which puts cameras in front, in back and on the side mirrors for parking assistance.|$|E
2500|$|On March 2, 2000, GM {{issued a}} recall for 450 Gen I EV1s. The automaker had {{determined}} that a faulty <b>charge</b> <b>port</b> cable could eventually build up enough heat to catch on fire. Sixteen [...] "thermal incidents" [...] {{and at least one}} fire occurred {{as a result of the}} defect, destroying a car leased by Ron Brauer and Ruth Bygness as it was charging.

2500|$|The 4.4kWh {{lithium-ion}} battery {{developed for the}} Prius Plug-in fits under the rear cargo floor and weighs [...] As a comparison, the nickel-metal hydride battery of the third generation Prius, which has a capacity of only 1.3kWh, weighs [...] A full charge using an external AC outlet takes approximately 2.5 to 3.0 hours from a standard North American 120V 15A household outlet, or 1.5 hours using a standard European 230V household outlet. [...] The battery requires approximately 3.2 kWh of electricity plus [...] of gasoline to provide [...] of range. [...] A fully charged {{battery state of charge}} reads 85% and the all-electric mode disengages at 23%, and the usable energy after charging loss is 2.73 kWh. The included charging cable connects to the charging port inlet located on the right-rear fender. The <b>charge</b> <b>port</b> location was moved from the front driver-side fender in the demonstration model based on input from the program participants. The battery charger cable weighs just , is [...] in length, and fits in its own compartment in the trunk area. [...] The <b>charge</b> <b>port</b> provides LED (Light Emitting Diode) illumination for convenient night-time charging. [...] A timer allows charging to take place during off-peak hours and can be set for either a start or end time.|$|E

2500|$|The home charger {{provided}} by GM, which {{was required for}} [...] "fast recharging" [...] of the car, measured roughly 1.5 by 2 by 5 feet (0.45 x 0.60 x 1.50 m), and featured integrated heatsinks and a resemblance to a gasoline pump. The charger refueled the car using induction, accomplished by inserting a Magne Charge paddle into the slot between the EV1's headlights. The wireless charging technology meant that no direct connection was made, and charging the car while it was raining did not pose any risks, though there were isolated incidents involving fires starting at the <b>charge</b> <b>port.</b> GM also offered a 120 V AC convenience charger {{that could be used}} with any standard North America power socket to slow-charge the battery pack. The convenience charger was not available for EV1s equipped with the NiMH battery packs. Installation of the device took between one and two weeks, at an additional average cost of $2500.|$|E
