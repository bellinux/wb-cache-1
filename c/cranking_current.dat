40|$|Effective {{vehicular}} {{power management}} requires accurate knowledge of battery state, including state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH). An essential functionality of automotive batteries is delivering high power in short periods to crank the engine. A well-known approach to battery SOH monitoring is to infer battery state-of-health from battery impedance or resistance, {{which is not}} robust to variation of battery types. The {{research and development of}} more reliable battery state-of-health monitoring methods to ensure vehicle start-up ability are presented in this thesis. The methods include a battery cranking voltage based method, a parity-relation based method using battery voltage and <b>cranking</b> <b>current</b> signals, and a support vector machine based pattern recognition method utilizing battery voltage and engine cranking speed. The performances of these methods have been evaluated and compared through analysis o...|$|E
40|$|The Defense Research Establishment Ottawa (DREO) {{has been}} {{studying}} the nickel-cadmium system, both vented and sealed, since the early 1950 's. Reasonable success has been achieved {{in a wide variety}} of applications covering: military vehicle use under Arctic conditions; high performance military aircraft; manpacked communications sets; remote standby power and small portable instrumentation. Early studies on the vented system for high rate vehicle and aircraft cranking applications proved useful in later studies on the sealed NiCd system. This was especially true in the areas of plate loading and electrolyte composition. To achieve high rate <b>cranking</b> <b>currents</b> of 20 C to 30 C, it was necessary to have light to moderate plate loadings, a large reactive surface area, and electrolyte of optimum conductivity. DREO undertook some fundamental studies to understand the system from the inside out rather than test cells from the outside and then analyze their components. The conclusions of these studies were incorporated into the Procurement Specification for Ni-Cd cells ISISA Spec S 615 -P- 2. A brief comment will be made on the choice of cell design and how some of the factors of cell manufacture could affect cell performance...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to jumper cables is a cable used to interconnect the 12 volt power outlets (cigarette lighter outlets) of two vehicles. While this eliminates concerns with incorrect connections and generation of arcs near battery terminals, {{the amount of}} current available through such a connection is small. This method works by slowly recharging the battery, not by providing the <b>current</b> needed for <b>cranking.</b> The engine <b>cranking</b> motor <b>current</b> draw will exceed the fuse rating in a cigarette lighter outlet. Many vehicles turn off the cigarette lighter outlets when the key is turned off, making the technique unusable unless the ignition key is turned to the accessory or on position to connect the cigarette lighter outlet to the battery.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{approximation}} dubbed as the Higher TammDankoff Approximation (HTDA) {{has been}} designed to treat microscopically pairing correlations within a particle number conserving approach. It relies upon a n parti-cle- n hole expansion of the nuclear wave-function. It is applied here for the rst time in a rotating frame, i. e. a self-consistent cranking approach (Cr. HTDA) devoted to the description of collective rotational motion in well-deformed nuclei. Moments of inertia predicted by Cr.

40|$|The {{so-called}} Higher Tamm–Dancoff Approximation (HTDA) {{has been}} designed to describe microscopically correlations within a particle number conserving approach. It relies upon a truncated n particle–n hole expansion of the nuclear wavefunction, where the single particle basis is optimized self-consistently by using the Skyrme mean field associated with the single-particle density matrix of the correlated wavefunction. It is applied {{here for the first time}} in a rotating frame, i. e. within a self-consistent cranking approach (cranked HTDA or CHTDA) aimed at describing the collective rotational motion in well-deformed nuclei.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} which provides a basic description of the force and displacements arising in multi-stage forging on a mechanical press. Given the stiffness of tools and press structure, for a given operational sequence, the variations in shut-height caused by deJections of tools and press during forging, compared with that under no load conditions, can be determined. Also the efect {{of a change in}} process conditions at one forging station on forces and dimensions of workpieces produced at other stations can be calculated. The model has been validated by experiments undertaken on a crank press in which upsetting and extrusion have been performed as both single and simultaneous operations.

40|$|AbstractTo {{optimize}} training {{relating to}} the coordinative skills of athletes, a special cycle ergometer ARES with decoupled cranks was developed. The system {{is equipped with a}} measurement system to measure radial and tangential forces on the pedals, additionally to the acquisition of angle velocities of the two crank wheels. Due to the decoupled cranks, every leg performs its own revolution, and has to be active even at the pulling phase, without direct support of the opposite legs downstroke. To explore the unique possibilities of ARES, 4 subjects were tested on the ergometer in a first trial. After a short acclimatization phase to get familiar with the characteristics of the bike, the following tests were performed: (1) normal biking at different numbers of revolution with the challenge to keep a 180 ° phase angle, and (2) special coordination tasks: a) biking with 0 ° phase angle, b) Stop-and-go procedures with re-synchronization of the movement, c) counter-movement with both legs moving into opposite direction, and d) a lower half circle swing. During the exercises, forces on the pedals, the <b>crank</b> positions and <b>current</b> cadence were acquired. Out of this data, torque, power, angle velocities and an efficiency parameter were determined for the left and right leg. Variations in cadence, forces and torque as a function of pedal angle are clearly visible. A dependency on number of revolutions seems to be evident, caused by the higher coordinative challenge at high velocities...|$|R
40|$|Improvements in engine {{efficiency}} {{are necessary for}} the advancement of modem engine technology. Fuels and lubricants used in internal combustion (IC) engines {{play an important role in}} governing the {{engine efficiency}}. In IC engines some amount of fuel spray can eventually end up on the cylinder liner. This fuel spray mixes with the oil (lubricant) present on the liner. Now the liquid layer on the liner consists of fuel and oil (fuel-oil film is formed) which interacts with the piston rings and the up-scraping of the fuel-oil film can cause the release of oil droplets into the combustion chamber. The released oil droplets lower the self-ignition temperature of the fuel vapor which might lead to pre-ignition. Pre-ignition is a phenomenon in which the fuel vapor ignites before the spark plug fires causing huge pressure rise which can be detrimental for the engine. The fuel spray on the liner can also pass through the piston rings during the compression stroke and can cause oil dilution in the <b>crank</b> case. The <b>current</b> work is mainly focused on analyzing the fuel-oil interaction on the cylinder liner. A numerical model has been developed in which fuel was modeled as a mixture of 10 hydrocarbon components and oil was modeled as a single n-alkane hydrocarbon. In this model, diffusion in the film, heat transfer in the film, and vaporization at the film-air interface have been coupled. Moving boundary (due to vaporization) was handled by solving the time required to remove the outermost layer while utilizing regular meshing. Implicit method and Newton's iteration method were used to ensure numerical stability and efficiency. Eventually the model calculates the remaining mixture thickness and content before the piston comes back to the specified location in the compression stroke. Some of the main inputs to the model are timing and location of the fuel droplets depositing on the liner, initial fuel film thickness, initial oil film thickness, liner temperature, and cylinder gas pressure. The results showed that with typical engine operational parameters, substantial portion of the initial film mixture still remains when the piston comes back if the initial fuel film thickness is in the range of 20 pm. Further studies were made to examine the consequences of the remaining mixture on the liner. A brief quantitative study was performed to compare the fuel-oil scraped volume and crevice volume. Additionally, the increase in ring-liner contact force due to local oil dilution on the liner was examined using an existing ring-liner lubrication model. by Vinayak Teja Kalva. Thesis: S.
