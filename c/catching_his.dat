5|$|After enrolling him, Smith signed Burdell {{up for all}} {{the same}} classes he had. Smith would do all {{schoolwork}} twice, changing it slightly to avoid professors <b>catching</b> <b>his</b> sham. When he had a test, he would take it twice and then turn it in under both names. By 1930, the school had awarded Burdell a bachelor's degree, {{and a few years}} later awarded the fictitious student a master's degree. The college listed him as an official alumnus, even though his name has remained on the active student rolls. In 1930, the ANAK Society, Georgia Tech's oldest secret society, offered Burdell membership.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{after the start of}} the second-half Hearts were awarded a penalty kick. Kujabi fouled Suso by pulling his jersey and <b>catching</b> <b>his</b> heel, but television replays showed that the foul had taken place outside the penalty area. Hibs were also reduced to ten men as Kujabi received his second yellow card, resulting in a red. Danny Grainger converted the penalty, which was also his first goal for Hearts. Soon afterwards, Ryan McGowan scored with a header after Hibs keeper Brown had initially saved from Stephen Elliott. Skácel finished the scoring with another shot from just outside the box to make it 5-1 for Hearts.|$|E

5|$|The Canadiens {{played the}} Chicago Black Hawks in Montreal on January 28, 1937. In the first period, Morenz {{went after the}} puck in the Chicago end while being chased by Black Hawks defenceman Earl Seibert. Morenz lost his balance {{and fell to the}} ice, {{crashing}} into the boards and <b>catching</b> <b>his</b> left skate in the wooden siding. Seibert, unable to stop, landed on him with full force. The resulting impact snapped Morenz's left leg, creating a noise heard throughout the rink. Helped to the Canadiens bench by his teammates, Morenz was taken to Hôpital St-Luc, where it was found that his leg was fractured in four places.|$|E
5|$|Becoming an {{unrestricted}} free {{agent in the}} off-season, Öhlund signed a seven-year, $26.25-million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning on July 1, 2009. Brought in as a mentor to fellow Swedish defenceman Victor Hedman, whom the Lightning drafted second overall in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, Öhlund was named an alternate captain of the Lightning. His first game with the Lightning was on October 3, 2009, against the Atlanta Thrashers; Öhlund had one assist in the game. The following month, he suffered an ankle injury after <b>catching</b> <b>his</b> skate into ice during {{a game against the}} Los Angeles Kings on November 14, 2009. He returned after missing 7 games. He re-injured the ankle in March 2011 after colliding with Christian Hanson during a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, causing him to miss an additional 8 games. Öhlund finished his first season with the Lightning with no goals and 13 assists in 67 games. Offensively, it marked the lowest point total of his career and the first time he did not score a goal during the regular season during his NHL career up to that point. Despite his reduced offensive statistics, he remained a key defenceman on the Lightning roster, leading the team with 22 minutes and 47 seconds of average ice time per game and 116 blocked shots.|$|E
5|$|Penn State got {{the ball}} to start the game, and drove down the field with {{relative}} ease (facing only one third down) prior to stalling at their 26-yard line and turning the ball over on downs. After an Indiana three and out, Penn State ran another drive {{at the end of}} which they turned over on downs. Each team ran one more drive before Indiana attained first downs on three consecutive plays, ultimately culminating their possession with a five-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Nate Sudfeld to Isaiah Roundtree, making the score 7–0 at the end of the first quarter. Penn State responded on their second drive of the second quarter via a 46-yard pass from Hackenberg to Robinson to tie the game. Later, Mitch Ewald kicked a short field goal to re-take the lead. Penn State had a chance to tie the game again when kicker Sam Ficken attempted a 42-yard field goal, but Indiana blocked the kick, and with their ensuing momentum drove down the field at the end of the half, ultimately ending with Ewald hitting a field goal as time expired. After halftime, Indiana ran a quick drive on which they punted before Penn State ran a 13-play, 80-yard drive that concluded with Robinson <b>catching</b> <b>his</b> second touchdown of the game, a 26-yard pass from Hackenberg. Indiana responded with a quick score; they converted a two-point conversion to take a 21–14 lead. Late in the third quarter, Hackenberg threw a fade pattern to Robinson in the corner of the end zone, which Robinson corralled, but he landed on his back out of bounds, and came up either with the wind knocked out, or some sort of back injury. Penn State settled for a field goal, and at the end of three, Indiana led 21–17. The fourth quarter entrenched the Hoosiers' lead, as they totaled 23 points to only 7 for Penn State, winning the game 44–24, their final score coming on a safety.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in late-May. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, as were Australia, who fielded their first-choice team. Bradman captained the team and batted at No. 3. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team would line up for Australia in the First Test, with the top six batsmen playing in the same positions. It was a chance for both teams to gain a psychological advantage. Australia won the toss and batted but stumbled early. Morris was out for five and Bradman came in to join Barnes at 1/11. The pair added 160 before Barnes fell and Hassett came in to join his captain. They took the score to 200 before the Bradman fell for 98, leaving Australia at 3/200. It was Bradman's highest score under 100 in first-class cricket and in his disappointment, he was slow to leave the ground after his dismissal. Bradman's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings, with Bradman <b>catching</b> <b>his</b> opposite number Norman Yardley in the second innings. Up to this point, Bradman had played {{in five of the}} first eight matches, all of which were won, seven by an innings. He had scored 107, 81, 146, 187 and 98, yielding a total of 619 runs at an average of 123.80.|$|E

500|$|Rodríguez Vergara {{observes that}} the General {{is like a}} supernatural being, {{simultaneously}} dying and being surrounded by symbolic circumstances such as rain, fiestas, and the plague. The novel begins with Bolívar immersed in purifying waters, {{in a state of}} ecstasy and meditation that suggests a priestly ritual. One of the women with whom the General sleeps, Queen Marie Louise, is described as a virgin with the profile of an idol—an allusion to the Virgin Mary. The General rides a mule into the last towns on his journey towards death, echoing Christ's entry into Jerusalem. He dies of mysterious and unknown causes, and the people burn his belongings in fear of <b>catching</b> <b>his</b> illness. In Rodríguez Vergara's view, [...] "Bolívar was sacrificed as a scapegoat to purge the guilt of the community." ...|$|E

2500|$|On his {{day he was}} one of {{the fastest}} bowlers in world cricket, but his playing style was also notable for his {{short-sightedness}} and poor <b>catching,</b> <b>his</b> powerful throwing arm, his perceived profligacy with the ball and his undoubted ineptitude with the bat, with his batting and fielding being described as of [...] "court-jester standard".|$|E

2500|$|During {{the chaotic}} retreat after Hohenlinden, Riesch clashed with his French pursuers at Rosenheim on 9 December. Outnumbered 10,000 to 6,000, his troops {{suffered}} 600 casualties while inflicting only 110 losses on the French. He commanded the rear guard in an unsuccessful action at Schwanenstadt on 18 December. <b>Catching</b> <b>his</b> troops {{with their backs}} to a river, Richepanse's cavalry forced 700 Austrian horsemen to surrender. By the time Archduke Charles replaced his brother John in command, the army was practically a rabble. Both sides agreed to a truce on 25 December 1800. Afterward, John heaped blame on Riesch for his slow march {{on the morning of}} [...] Hohenlinden, but this may be unfair because the French movements were also slow due to the miserable road conditions.|$|E

GAA President Liam O'Neill later related that Murphy, as they exchanged the Sam Maguire Cup, had offered his condolences on the sudden death of O'Neill's sister the previous day.

2500|$|Damiano Caruso (...) {{broke into}} the 45-minute region with the next quickest time for the course, with the weather {{conditions}} changing around {{the time that he}} was reaching the finish in Polsa. From the sun that had greeted the earlier runners on the course, the weather worsened and soon heavy rain was falling. Caruso's time was ultimately good enough for third on the stage; the first rider to beat the time was 's Samuel Sánchez, who recorded a time of 45' 27", a time which enabled him to move into the top ten in the general classification. However, the best performance was left to the overall leader, Nibali.
