40|$|Reflecting the Asian {{currency}} crisis, the East Asian countries, including Japan, {{the economy}} of the region is attempting to build the strong fund channel by <b>consolidating</b> <b>bond</b> markets. On the other hand, there exists an agricultural society whose access even to commercial banks is difficult. Nevertheless, as seen in the success of Grameen Banks, and the Asian and Pacific Regional Agricultural Credit Association (APRCA), the fund channel based on market mechanism has been shaped through the intervention of NGOs, self-help financial groups, and public and private financial institutions. It seems possible that the financial system in the region has developed from microfinance into a market-oriented indirect finance system, which includes the trade of government bond, local bond and investment trusts.

The reserve requirement systems in sub-Saharan Africa are relatively simple and transparent, but in some countries high unremunerated reserve ratios impose a significant implicit tax on the banks.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the application of}} a quadratic programming model to the bond and note participation decision of a Cooperative Farm Credit Bank. The model generates an efficient frontier of bond and note portfolios from which a bank can choose. The composition of these portfolios depends upon the expected cost and variance-covariance of cost for the bond and note activities, debt needs, and the debt policy constraints of a bank. The results indicate that the interest rate risk of various bond and note issues should be considered when making debt participation decisions. The Cooperative Farm Credit System has become a major supplier of credit to agricul-ture. On January 1, 1980, the 37 banks of the System collectively extended in excess of $ 48 billion to agriculture. This entailed 36 per-cent of all farm real estate debt and 25 per-cent of all farm nonreal estate debt. The System obtains funds for loans from the na-tional money market by issuing system-wide <b>consolidated</b> <b>bonds</b> and discount notes. The interest cost on bonds and notes depends upon market interest rates which have been very volatile in recent years and are not controllable by the System [Bildersee]. In order to obtain sufficient funds, the System must be willing to offer investors competitive rates. Although cost control is imperative in all segments of the System's operations, it is especially important in the funds acquisition process since interest paid on System debt securities typically accounts for over 90 per...|$|R

In the Author’s opinion, the loss of consideration of music teaching in school is nowadays due to its representation (in both parents’, teachers’ and pupils’ minds) as “a play”, or as a specific profession, ignoring its essential function of intellectual and emotional balance; an achievement that young people could obtain through musical education.
