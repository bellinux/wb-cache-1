Lyte was not a regular at court, but he had drawn up a family tree tracing James's descent back to the legendary Trojan, Brut. The jewel contains a miniature portrait of the king by Nicholas Hilliard, though for conservation reasons this is now removed from the jewel. Lyte wears the jewel in a portrait of 1611, showing a drop below the main oval set with three diamonds, which had gone before 1882. [...] The front cover has an elaborate openwork design with James's monogram IR, while the back has very finely executed enamel decoration.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present, and to explain the {{construction}} of, a set of price indexes relating to international trade in manufactured goods. These include: 1. Indexes of export prices for the U. S., Germany, and Japan, based on their weights, and indexes of competitors' prices for each <b>of</b> those <b>countries</b> based on the sane set of weights; 2. Indexes of domestic prices for the U. S., Germany, and Japan based on export weights; 3. Indexes for developed <b>country</b> exports <b>of</b> <b>manufactures</b> based on weights <b>of</b> developed <b>country</b> exports <b>of</b> <b>manufactures</b> to developing <b>countries</b> and <b>of</b> total developed <b>country</b> exports <b>of</b> <b>manufactures,</b> and indexes for exports of the U. S., Germany, and Japan on the sane sets of weights. The indexes for developed country exports make use of a method for estimating missing prices that takes account not only of contemporaneous price changes in the same country within the sane community groups, but also of price changes for the particular commodity in other countries. Comparisons are made between movements of domestic and export prices and between price indexes based on weights of early and late base years. In addition, an attempt is made to correct the price indexes for changes in the quality <b>of</b> some <b>manufactured</b> goods not usually taken account of in measures of export or import prices. ...|$|R

The results suggest that crisis-hit countries experience lower levels of bilateral exports, particularly in developing countries where supply-side shocks {{are found to be}} relatively more important than demand shocks. In developing <b>countries,</b> exports <b>of</b> <b>manufactured</b> goods are disproportionately hurt by banking crises and this negative effect is stronger in industries relying more on external finance. These findings are robust to correcting for potential endogeneity, to changes in the sample, and to alternative estimation methods...|$|R
