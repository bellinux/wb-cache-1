40|$|Abstract: The Military Engineering eXperimental Establishment (MEXE) {{method is}} a long {{established}} system of masonry arch load carrying capacity assessment. It has been subject to review {{in recent years and}} some shortcomings have been identified. There is now growing consensus that the current version of MEXE overestimates the load carrying capacity of short span bridges, but for spans over 12 m it becomes increasingly conservative. In this paper Pippard’s elastic method and the MEXE method are used to investigate the significance of factors such as fill <b>cover,</b> <b>ring</b> thickness and effective width of arch barrel, and their effect upon the load-carrying capacity predictions in short and long span arches. Conclusions are drawn which establish directions of new research and offer guidance to assessors of short and long span masonry arch bridges...|$|E
30|$|In an undirected graph, {{covering}} a user’s location may {{require more than}} one ring. For example, in Fig.  1, covering the user 1 ring {{with the exception of}} <node 13, node 14, node 18, node 17, node 13 >, ring <node 14, node 15, node 19, node 18, node 14 > and ring <node 14, node 3, node 4, node 5, node 15, node 19, node 18, node 14 >, etc. So after finding his <b>cover</b> <b>ring</b> for the user, it must be determined whether these rings are the hidden rings. If more than one ring is in line with the concealed conditions, then one must select the number of sections and mobile subscribers closest to the user location privacy ring (called the ring for the optimal hidden ring) as users of the hidden position. This is because in all the hidden rings, the number of mobile users and sections will cause location server query processing cost to be higher. At the same time, it also can reduce the quality of mobile client service. So it is a necessary step to select the optimal hidden ring.|$|E

40|$|We present {{algorithms}} for {{the drawing}} of survivable telecommunication networks. The visualization of telecommunication networks {{is a very important}} problem. For some specific rings in a network, we may have a high traffic. The network designers may decide to add more equipment to the nodes (sites) of these rings in order to increase the performance of the network. Therefore, {{one of the most important}} properties of the survivable telecommunication network, is that rings should be easily recognizable. Given a <b>ring</b> <b>cover</b> of survivable telecommunication networks, we provide three techniques for drawing a <b>ring</b> <b>cover.</b> We should mention that all these drawings should respect many criteria in order to preserve the readability of the drawing. As in most of the graph drawing algorithms, the area used for the drawing is very important, our proposed algorithms produce drawings that require O(n^{ 2 }) area, where n is the number of nodes in the <b>ring</b> <b>cover.</b> These drawings are clear and easy to understand by the network designers...|$|R

We are motivated to design a network which (1) satisfies the traffic requirements, (2) can survives failures, and (c) the cost of the network is minimum. A network [...] ...|$|R
