40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this diploma thesis is {{defining}} the <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> of surface waters for suitable land management, which is also reflected on water quality. Besides basic concepts, legal backgrounds in Slovenia, which are related to water areas and water management, are introduced. The thesis presents the existing models of <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> of waters in Slovenia and it especially exposes the subsistent methodology of defining <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> of surface waters {{on the basis of}} digital elevation models and other geographically defined data in GIS, which stood as a foundation for defining <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> at the local level. The analysis of land use inside the predetermined <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> delineated in GIS was performed within the study area. The emphasis of this thesis is set on modeling <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> and on extracting of the current state and defining the influence of land use on surface waters within their <b>catchment</b> <b>areas.</b> Determination of <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> of surface waters and analysis of land use in these areas can significantly support the idea of suitable land management and efficient response in case of different kinds of pollutions, which influences also the water quality...|$|R

Meanwhile the purpose of this research was to know the governmental efforts to protect water <b>catchments</b> <b>area</b> from sand mining in Sleman Regency, in particularly in Cangkringan Subdistrict. In addition the method used for collecting data was direct interview to the source person and respondent. From the research result, up till now the effort of legal protection conducted by the government towards water <b>catchments</b> <b>area</b> has not been fully optimal. It is caused by some matters, e. g. the inexistence of particular regulation that rules, the lack of coordination between the related institution, and the lack of employees in governmental institution and also the lack of budget provided by regional government up till now. Thus the government of Sleman Regency should improve the working system in related institution and unify the similar vision and mission, as well as the government should establish a strict regulation for managing and supervising water <b>catchments</b> <b>area</b> in Sleman Regency. For the surrounding society and the sand miners, they should have consideration and maintain the function of water <b>catchments</b> <b>area</b> in order to decrease environmental destruction of which is resulted by the mining activity in water <b>catchments</b> <b>area...</b>|$|R

As schools were built in those suburbs in 1974–1976, congestion eased considerably. The school and kindergarten were also used as a hall and meeting place by residents and groups until the recreation centre opened in April 1975. In 2016, the school provided for 248 primary students between Year 1 and Year 6, and 28 pre-primary students.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to study the influence of anthropogenic burden on the <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> of the rivers in Vologda Region and to establish the dependence of the chemical composition of water on pollution sources in the rivers of the Verkhnyaya Sukhona basin. In the <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> hydro chemical samples were taken, population density was calculated {{as well as the}} automated and visual interpretation of the main elements of the landscape was carried out. At that, forests, populated areas, farmlands and other territories changed by economic activities were identified. An increase in the pollutants concentration in the <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> on drawing near the regional center was detected. The development of the <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> varies depending on the landscape pattern and on the proximity to the city of Vologda. The population density and the relative area of settlements and farmlands increase while approaching to the city, {{at the same time the}} ratio of forests decreases. The positive correlation dependence between the phosphate content and the relative size of farmlands was shown. The main source of pollutants in the <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> of the Verkhnyaya Sukhona basin is the presence of settlements and high population density. Under such conditions, high concentration of sodium, chlorine, nitrogen-containing compounds as well as permanganate oxidizability are observed in water...|$|R
