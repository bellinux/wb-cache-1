40|$|In {{the current}} {{versions}} of Global Navigation Satellite Systems as GPS and Galileo each satellite is launched {{with a set}} of redundant clocks e. g. each Galileo vehicle has two Rubidium clocks and two passive Hydrogen masers. Onboard each satellite only one clock signal is used as base for the navigation signals while the others serve as backup. Typically, one clock serves as a hot redundancy, the other two as cold redundancies [1]. Anomalies on the clocks have to be detected and handled by the ground monitor segment. We propose to use the ensembling approach of Brown [2] onboard each satellite to generate an ensemble time for each satellite. This approach includes a continuous measurement between the <b>ensemble</b> <b>clocks</b> providing the opportunity to monitor the clock directly onboard. In our Timing Laboratory we have set up a hardware demonstrator with three Rubidium clocks and a Micro Phase Stepper (MPS). A server is continuously receiving measurement data and processes it with a Kalman filter to obtain estimates of the single <b>clocks</b> in the <b>ensemble.</b> A second filter determines control values to be applied on the MPS. As a result, the MPS serves as a realization of the ensemble time generated from the Rubidium clocks. In addition, artificial jumps can be generated on the signal of one <b>ensemble</b> <b>clock.</b> The algorithms are augmented by jump detection and handling routines. The performance of the IEM realization and the <b>ensemble</b> <b>clocks</b> is analyzed. As a result, outages and anomalies can be detected and handled faster which leads to an enhanced robustness of the clock signal used onboard the satellite. The performance of the demonstrator is analyzed by a measurement against an Active Hydrogen Maser.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. Atomic Clocks provide "stable" signals that are mainly {{used to generate}} time scales and to measure differences of time between events. Each atomic clock can individually be characterized according to {{the stability of the}} scale it produces. Due to the stochastic behavior of each <b>clock,</b> usually <b>clock</b> <b>ensembles</b> are used to build more stable time scales. This process requires basically two steps. First it is required to individually characterize each time source to identify the particular noise components present. Second, a measure of performance is required in order to derive an algorithm based on it to properly "weigh" this particular clock in the process of creating a combined scale. In this thesis both problems are faced using an operations research approach: each clock is modeled, analyzed and characterized by a time-dependent measure of performance related to its intrinsic stability, and optimally combined to produce a more stable combined time scale. The optimality criterion {{is directly related to the}} spectral characteristics of the noise sources present. Real laboratory data provided by the "Real Observatio de la Armana", ROA (Royal Observatory of the Spanish Navy) is used to tune the final algorithm to the time standards present in the ROA.
