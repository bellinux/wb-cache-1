Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. <b>Chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> (Dursban) belongs to the organophosphate class of pesticides. Many organophosphates, such as parathion and chlordane, are highly toxic and have restricted usage. Others, including <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl,</b> are widely used for domestic and agricultural purposes because of their relatively low toxicity. Exposure to <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> is commonly determined by measuring cholinesterase inhibition. This method requires blood. sample analysis via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and can be expensive and time consuming. Immunoassay techniques have been developed for measuring <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> concentrations in water. Compared to conventional methodology, these new techniques are economical, rapid, and statistically equivalent to GC/MS results. This study attempted to quantify the amount of <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> in urine samples using the two-step indirect competitive assay form of Enzyme Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (cELISA), with confirmation by GC/MS. The selected cELISA (Millipores EnviroGard <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> plate kit) is a quantitative laboratory test traditionally used to detect <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> in water samples. Even though the parent compound is metabolized before being excreted in urine, the urinary traces of <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> that are present should have been sufficient {{for the purposes of this}} study. The cELISA was selected solely because it detects <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> at 0. 08 ppb. It was also selected because it detects the primary metabolite 3, 5, 6 -TCP, which was expected in urine, at 85 ppb. While the metabolite's detection limit is not as desirable as the parent compounds' detection limit, it is still acceptable. <b>Chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> was detected in a few samples with the immunoassay. However, traditional GC/MS techniques failed to detect this pesticide in the same samples. No correlation was established between the two methods. Therefore, it is not yet possible to recommend this cELISA as a reliable method for detection of <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> in urine...|$|E

It is therefore crucial to study whether insecticides affect this natural pest control agent. Predation activity, i. e., the number of aphids eaten in 24 h, was determined under laboratory conditions after exposure of fourth-instar nymphs and adult earwigs to widely used insecticides (acetamiprid, <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl,</b> deltamethrin, and spinosad), which were applied at the normal application rates. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase activities were also measured as indicators of pesticide exposure. Predation activity decreased significantly in nymphs exposed to spinosad (62 %) and <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> (98 %) compared with controls. A similar response was found for both esterase activities. Spinosad had a stronger effect on AChE (- 33 %) whereas <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> affected CbE activity preferentially (- 59 %).

The data showed that the decay of pirimiphos-methyl after one week was (49. 9 %) in well water compared with that of distilled and SHW (29. 4 ad 44. 5 %). Decay of <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> in distilled water after one week was 11. 7 % then increased afterwards and reached 29. 5, 40. 8 and 99. 5 % of the amount determined at zero (initial deposit) after 14, 21 and 75 days.

40|$|Due to an {{intensive}} {{use of chemical}} insecticides, resistance mechanisms to insecticides together with adverse effects on non-target organisms have been largely reported. Improvement in pest control strategy represents an urgent need to optimize efficiency in the control of pest insects. In this context, a novel method based {{on the use of}} insect specific virus applied in combination with chemical insecticide, which could lead to sensitization of the insect target to insecticides is described. Insect virus, the baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), applied onto Sf 9 cells induces an increase of intracellular calcium concentration via extracellular calcium influx. Co-application of AcMNPV with <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> onto Sf 9 cells expressing the key enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), known to be targeted by organophosphate insecticides, increases 1. 5 -fold the sensitivity of AChE to the insecticide. This effect is correlated with intracellular calcium concentration rise since AcMNPV-induced potentiating insecticide effect is counteracted by pretreatment with the calcium channel blocker, cadmium chloride. Increasing insecticide target sensitivity through intracellular calcium modulation by using insect virus co-applied with a chemical insecticide is a very promising strategy allowing optimization of insecticide treatment while reducing the concentration of insecticides used...|$|E

The present study aims to evaluate the toxicity of emamectin benzoate to codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), and oriental fruit moth, C. molesta (Busck), under laboratory and semi-field conditions. RESULTS: Dose response bioassays showed that emamectin benzoate had {{a high level of}} intrinsic toxicity to early-stage larvae of both species, and that contact activity might contribute significantly to mortality. In the semi-field trials, residual toxicity lasted for more than 1 week. Ovicidal activity was recorded only for C. pomonella (approximately 30 %), irrespective of the concentrations tested. Field trials confirmed the efficacy of emamectin benzoate on codling moth when applied at 7 day intervals. Fruit damage, both from the first and second generations, was comparable with that on treatment with <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl,</b> used as a chemical reference. CONCLUSION: Emamectin benzoate may be considered a valuable tool for the control of codling moth as a component of an IPM programme.

However, {{little is known about the}} roles of P 450 s and their responses to insecticide exposure in the codling moth Cydia pomonella (L.), an economically important fruit pest. Here we report the characterization and expression analysis of the first P 450 gene, designated as CYP 9 A 61, from this pest. The full-length cDNA sequence of CYP 9 A 61 is 2071 bp long and its open reading frame (ORF) encodes 538 amino acids. Sequence analysis shows that CYP 9 A 61 shares 51 %– 60 % identity with other known CYP 9 s and contains the highly conserved substrate recognition site SRS 1, SRS 4 and SRS 5. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that CYP 9 A 61 were 67 -fold higher in the fifth instar larvae than in the first instar, and more abundant in the silk gland and fat body than other tissues.

These commercial orchards were as well compared to abandoned orchards. The density of Forficula auricularia and Forficula pubescens was studied for three years in 74 orchards around Avignon. The pesticide usage, some orchard characteristics and two small-scale landscape parameters were characterized. Pesticide use was significantly different between low-input, organic and IPM orchards with particularly significant differences in the number of insecticide applications (2. 2, 4. 9 and 9. 2 respectively). Pesticide use had a much stronger impact on earwig community than other characteristics. F. auricularia density was significantly lower in IPM orchards (0. 47 individuals per tree) compared to organic, low-input and abandoned orchards (3. 1, 4. 5 and 1. 6 individuals per tree, respectively). F. pubescens was almost absent from IPM orchards and its abundance was higher in abandoned or low-input orchards compared to organic orchards (1. 5 and 2. 8 vs 0. 8 individuals per tree). The percentage of F. pubescens in the earwig community decreased from abandoned (52 %) to low-input (40 %), organic (15 %) and IPM orchards (0. 5 %). These results were confirmed by LD 50 assays showing that for the two pesticides causing mortality close to normal application rates (<b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> and acetamiprid), F. pubescens was significantly more sensitive than F. auricularia. Since earwigs are also easy to capture and identify, they may be useful to estimate the effects of management strategies and their modification in pome fruit orchards. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In Benin, {{the use of}} {{synthetic}} pesticides in vegetable production poses a risk {{to the environment and}} human health. Vegetables, water and soil quality assessment is very important for monitoring and mitigation of these risks. The evaluation of pesticide contamination of vegetables and agricultural environment is often made using expensive methods. It is crucial for research in so-called developing countries to develop less expensive tools for pesticide risks assessment and monitoring. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the potential of using Aedes aegypti larvae as a bio-indicator to measure the pesticide contamination of soil, groundwater and vegetables. Vegetables just before harvest, groundwater and soils samples from three production sites and vegetables samples from markets were collected from March to August 2011. Ethanol extracts of these samples were tested on first stage larvae of Aedes aegypti. The method made it possible to detect residues of <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl</b> and deltamethrin in cabbage until 4 and 8 days respectively after treatment with the recommended doses for crop protection. It proved inappropriate to measure pesticides residues in market-gardening soils, since these soils contain some amounts of nitrite, nitrate and phosphate, coming from the decomposition of fertilizers which are poisonous for the first stage larvae of Aedes aegypti. Overall, the results revealed the presence of small amounts of pesticides residues in 12. 5 % of the vegetables collected from markets. Pesticides residues were also detected in 30. 0 % of vegetables collected just before harvest. Residues of pesticide were not detected in groundwater samples collected from vegetable growing areas. First stage larvae of Aedes aegypti could be used as a bio-indicator to characterize and monitor risk of pesticide contamination of vegetables in southern Benin. It could also be used for a monitoring program before running a more thorough chemical analysis to identify and quantify the pesticide molecules present in samples. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|L'une des difficultés rencontrées couramment dans la {{conception}} des réseaux de mesure - au moins {{en ce qui concerne}} les micropolluants - porte sur la sélection des paramètres à mesurer. C'est notamment le cas pour les pesticides, dont plusieurs centaines sont utilisées en agriculture, mais qu'il est impossible de surveiller dans les eaux en totalité pour des raisons à la fois techniques et économiques. C'est la raison pour laquelle les autorités françaises ont fait procéder à la mise au point d'une méthode de sélection des matières actives utilisées en agriculture basée sur l'évaluation du risque. Dans cette méthode, l'exposition est figurée par un rang combinant les données relatives aux usages des matières actives (superficie, dose par ha) et leurs caractéristiques physico-chimiques. Le danger est représenté par la toxicité, soit pour l'homme, soit pour les espèces aquatiques. Cette approche a été appliquée à l'échelle nationale et dans un certain nombre de régions françaises, dont l'Alsace et la Lorraine. Les résultats des mesures de pesticides réalisées ensuite pendant un an ont été confrontés aux indices d'exposition obtenus. Les substances détectées le plus fréquemment correspondent effectivement à celles dotées des rangs d'exposition les plus élevés (ajustement exponentiel, r 2 ≈ 0. 82); cependant, le diuron apparaît à une fréquence plus élevée que celle attendue, {{en raison de}} ses usages non agricoles. La corrélation est moins bonne pour les substances dont les rangs d'exposition sont proches de la valeur considérée comme significative pour les eaux superficielles, ce qui peut provenir soit de l'utilisation de données erronées lors de la sélection, soit d'un poids insuffisant attribué à certains facteurs dans la méthode de sélection, soit enfin d'aléas météorologiques. Monitoring of micropollutants is {{a rather}} recent activity (10 - 15 years), at least in surface waters; because of the need for sophisticated analytical methods and of the potential number of analytes, this type of activity is confronted with important economic constraints, which require that one make a selection among the range of substances to monitor. Among organic micropollutants, pesticides constitute a well-identified category, since they are used mainly in agriculture; this use on broad surfaces may have important impacts on the quality of surface water. Various methods have been used to select those pesticides likely to have the greatest impacts on water quality; some of these methods might be considered to be "hazard assessment", whereas others correspond to simplified "risk assessment" methods (this appears particularly true for pesticides, of which several hundreds are used in agriculture). Recently, a French panel of experts mandated by different Ministries designed a selection method called SIRIS, which allows one to define three different lists of pesticides according to the media to be monitored (surface or ground-water) and to the monitoring objectives (ecosystem protection, drinking water production). This paper deals with the application of the SIRIS method at a regional level, {{in the context of a}} permanent survey of river quality. As a simplified risk assessment method, SIRIS combines data on hazard and exposure; hazard is estimated by a single parameter, either toxicity for aquatic species or acceptable daily intake (ADI). Exposure represents the probability that a transfer to water bodies may occur; for surface water, this probability is influenced by the crop acreage, the applied dose (kg/ha), the solubility, the pesticide half-life, the hydrolysis and the distribution coefficient between water and organic matter (Koc). These factors are considered in this hierarchical order, and for each substance a score is assigned to each of these factors among three possible values ("o"=slight, "m"=medium, "d"=high, according to the relative influence on transfer); finally exposure is estimated by a relative rank obtained by a combination of these values following a "penalisation" principle. Two tables are available for applying this approach at a regional level: the first contains the values (o,m,d) assigned to more than 300 substances by the expert panel for solubility, half-life, etc., and should be completed with crop acreage and dose. The second table provides the ranks corresponding to the different combinations of o,m,d values. A final rank of 35 was considered by consensus to be a pragmatic threshold for the transfer to surface water. This method was applied in 1996 in two regions in France (Alsace and Lorraine) separately; most of the selected chemicals (but unfortunately not all, due to technical constraints) were then analysed monthly in surface waters (24 sampling points, yielding 144 samples in Alsace and 169 in Lorraine). Occurrences fell between 0 % and 60 % in Alsace, and between 0 % and 90 % in Lorraine; in both regions, the most frequently detected chemicals were atrazine and diuron. The relevance of the selection method may be discussed under several aspects: the choice of the factors, their order, the position of thresholds corresponding to o,m,d values, the value of the overall threshold, and the availability of the data. Some pesticides are not ranked only because no data were available concerning their solubility, hydrolysis rate or Koc, but the relative importance of such gaps cannot be appreciated with the current set of data. Other items may be assessed through the comparison of the exposure rank versus the occurrence. This relationship takes an exponential shape, with some anomalies: for example, the occurrence of diuron in Alsace is higher than expected, based on its exposure rank. This situation can be explained by the fact that there are non-agricultural uses of this substance, such that the exposure rank appears to be underestimated. For other substances, like aldicarb and <b>chlorpyrifos-ethyl,</b> discrepancies are observed between the exposure rank and occurrences, when comparing with substances with higher exposure ranks. This anomaly may be due to poor data quality. For carbendazime, the occurrence in Lorraine appears underestimated, probably because of a dry period deficit after the application. Finally, chlortoluron received the same rank in the 2 regions, but is more frequently detected in Lorraine; crop acreage may have been overestimated in Alsace. However, the dataset is still limited to one year of sampling; some discrepancies may appear less important when more data are available. For chemicals with ranks > 50, there is a good exponential fit between ranks and occurrences (y= 0. 0235 *e 0. 0739 x; r 2 = 0. 82). This observation means that pesticides with ranks > 50 are systematically encountered in surface waters; however, the current threshold (35) should be maintained, because some substances with ranks < 50 are also detected. Thus, the SIRIS method appears to be a good tool for selecting agricultural pesticides for monitoring purposes at a regional level...|$|E
