50|$|A card printer is an {{electronic}} desktop printer with single <b>card</b> <b>feeders</b> which print and personalize plastic cards. In this respect they differ from, for example, label printers {{which have a}} continuous supply feed. Card dimensions are usually 85.60 Ã— 53.98 mm, standardized under ISO/IEC 7810 as ID-1. This format is also used in EC-cards, telephone cards, European Union driver's licenses and health insurance cards. This {{is commonly known as}} the bank card format. Card printers are controlled by corresponding printer drivers or by means of a specific programming language. Generally card printers are designed with laminating, striping, and punching functions, and use desktop or web-based software. The hardware features of a card printer differentiate a card printer from the more traditional printers, as ID cards are usually made of PVC plastic and require laminating and punching. Different card printers can accept different card thickness and dimensions.|$|R
