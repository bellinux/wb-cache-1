25|$|The list {{of items}} tested has been {{continually}} expanded over the years, including in 1968 – a tyre check; 1977 – checks of windscreen wipers and washers, direction indicators, brakelights, horns, exhaust system and condition of the body structure and chassis; 1991 – checks of the emissions test for petrol engine vehicles, together with checks on the anti-lock braking system, rear wheel bearings, rear wheel steering (where appropriate) and rear seat belts; 1992 – a stricter tyre tread depth requirement for most vehicles; 1994 – a check of emissions for diesel engine vehicles; 2005 – introduction of a <b>computerised</b> <b>administration</b> system for issuing non-secure test certificates. Also rolled out in 2005 {{was the creation of}} the 'Automated Test Bay' this differs from traditional testing by adding additional equipment to the bay to negate the use of an assistant during the test; 2012 – checks of secondary restraint systems, battery and wiring, ESC, speedometers and steering locks.|$|E
40|$|The {{concepts}} of adaptive testing, already used by Binet, and {{concepts of}} modern or latent trait theory, already extended from psychophysics by Thurstone, {{have been brought}} together by {{the advent of the}} computer, particularly the PC. With these developments, it is likely that to test specific abilities, special tests will be constructed for administration only by a computer and not in pencil and paper format. In the meantime, many existing paper-and-pencil tests, which usually are not administered adaptively, are being computerised. Among important tests in the educational and psychological literature, and therefore candidates for <b>computerised</b> <b>administration,</b> are the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). Before some inferences can be made across different modes of presentation, however, it is necessary that the degree of consistency of the responses across the two modes be evaluated in a variety of circumstances and by a variety of processes. This paper describes use of the Rasch latent trait model to help (i) implement <b>computerised</b> <b>administration</b> of the standard and advanced forms of the RPM, (ii) compare the relative item difficulties of the computerised form with those from a pencil-and-paper administration of the same items to a different group of persons, and (iii) to convert scores between the advanced and standard forms of the RPM using the two modes of testing, and to compare these scores with the results of a traditional method of equating reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} caregivers’ {{experience of}} oncology services for ambulatory patients {{and to develop}} a short instrument (FAMCARE- 6) suitable for <b>computerised</b> <b>administration</b> in the clinical setting. Methods: A sample of 234 caregivers recruited from 388 ambulatory oncology patients completed a computerised version of the 20 -item family satisfaction with advanced cancer care (FAMCARE) instrument, which was originally developed for use in palliative care settings. Results: Caregivers reported generally high satisfaction with all aspects of ambulatory oncology services: overall score; mean, 3. 96 (SD, 0. 67); information giving, 3. 88 (0. 78); physical patient care, 4. 00 (0. 71); availability of care, 3. 89 (0. 77); and psychosocial care, 4. 05 (0. 72), from a possible score of 5. Factor analyses identified a single factor structure; the items were reduced to six (FAMCARE- 6), which yielded a scale with adequate psychometric properties (completion rates over 90 % for every item, correlation of 0. 7 or above with the factor identified in the individual item factor analysis, and internal reliability of α= 0. 85). The overall mean score was 3. 91 (SD, 0. 73) for the FAMCARE- 6. Conclusions: FAMCARE- 6 can be used to assess caregiver satisfaction with ambulatory oncology services and may be suitable to be included as part of a computerised screening system for the psychological care of oncology patients...|$|E
