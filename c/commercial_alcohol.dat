40|$|Abstract — Aims: Alcohol {{portrayal}} {{in movies}} and commercials is generally positive and might stimulate young people to drink. We tested experimentally whether portrayal of alcohol images {{in movies and}} commercials on television promotes actual drinking. Methods: In a naturalistic setting (a bar lab), young adult male pairs watched a movie clip for 1 h with two commercial breaks and were allowed to drink non-alcohol and alcoholic beverages. These participants {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four condi-tions varying on the type of movie (many versus few <b>alcohol</b> portrayals) and <b>commercials</b> (<b>alcohol</b> <b>commercials</b> present or not). Results: Participants assigned to the conditions with substantial alcohol exposure in either movies or <b>commercials</b> consume more <b>alcohol</b> than other participants. Those in the condition with alcohol portrayal in movie and commercials drank on average 1. 5 glasses more than those in the condition with no alcohol portrayal, within a period of 1 h. Conclusions: This study—for the first time—shows a causal link between exposure to drinking models and <b>alcohol</b> <b>commercials</b> on acute <b>alcohol</b> consumption...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the effect of viewing different types of alcohol-related television advertising on immediate urge to drink and alcohol-related cognitions. The study aimed to integrate the role of individual differences in personality, as conceptualised in Gray’s Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST), into the findings. 100 university students aged 18 to 32 years (Mage = 22. 59 years) viewed a television segment embedded with either <b>commercial</b> <b>alcohol</b> advertisements, government endorsed anti-binge-drinking advertisements, or non-alcohol related neutral advertisements. Participants then completed a computerised implicit measure of alcohol expectancies (the ETask) that was embedded with either alcohol or non-alcohol beverage cues. Participants also completed self-report measures of the original and revised RST, explicit alcohol expectancies, immediate affective state, and current drinking behaviour. Subjective, immediate urge to drink was measured at baseline and after viewing the television segment and completing the ETask. The results revealed that while viewing <b>commercial</b> <b>alcohol</b> advertisements appeared to increase immediate desire to drink, they did not affect implicit or explicit endorsement of alcohol expectancies. Additionally, there was some evidence that government anti-binge drinking advertisements also increased immediate desire to drink, while not affecting implicit or explicit endorsement of alcohol expectancies. Finally, {{it was found that}} individual differences in sensitivity to reward had selective effects on reactivity to the alcohol-related advertisements, including ratings of urge to drink for emotion-regulation motives.
