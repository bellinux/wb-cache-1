50|$|Soda {{locomotives}} were {{a variant}} of fireless locomotives, in which steam {{was raised in a}} boiler, expanded through cylinders in the usual way, and then condensed in a tank of <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> that surrounded the boiler. Dissolving water in <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> liberated heat, which generated more steam from the boiler, until the <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> became too dilute to release heat at a useful temperature.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> on the intensity of gassing {{in the production of}} non-autoclaved aerated concrete. It has been found out that adding 0. 8 and 1. 0 percent of <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> increases the amount of released hydrogen by 20 - 40 %. This is due to <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> increasing the alkalinity of the medium, which intensifies gassing. Exceeding the optimum amounts of <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> rapidly increases the elastic strength and worsens the ‘swelling’ of the AC mixture. Physico-mechanical tests of aerated concrete samples showed a considerable improvement in properties compared to the control composition...|$|R
40|$|The stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) behaviour of medium carbon steel (MCS) in <b>caustic</b> <b>soda,</b> potash and a mixture of these reagents was studied by fracturing this material on a tensometer after every seven days of immersion in these media. Percentage elongation and reduction in cross-sectional area were used to investigate the SCC of the steel. The results obtained showed that MCS is susceptible to SCC in both <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> and potash media. Carbon cracking caused intergranular SCC in both media due to retained internal stresses in the steel while hydrogen cracking also occurred in <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> medium, hence MCS is more susceptible to SCC in <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> medium than potash solution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper mainly {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} sodium alginate to polyester fabric {{in the process of}} wool-like. Polyester is pre-treated by sodium alginate solution firstly, and then modified by <b>caustic</b> <b>soda,</b> at last, the sample is steamed in the saturated vapor. Wool-like effect changes along with the concentration of sodium alginate and <b>caustic</b> <b>soda,</b> steaming time are analyzed. The results show that wettability, warmth retention and fullness of wool-like fabric are improved obviously. So treated with sodium alginate and then <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> can give polyester fabric ideal wool-like effect...|$|R

50|$|In the {{diaphragm}} cell process, {{there are two}} compartments separated by a permeable diaphragm, often made of asbestos fibers. Brine is introduced into the anode compartment and flows into the cathode compartment. Similarly to the Membrane Cell, chloride ions are oxidized at the anode to produce chlorine, and at the cathode, water is split into <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> and hydrogen. The diaphragm prevents {{the reaction of the}} <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> with the chlorine. A diluted caustic brine leaves the cell. The <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> must usually be concentrated to 50% and the salt removed. This is done using an evaporative process with about three tonnes of steam per tonne of <b>caustic</b> <b>soda.</b> The salt separated from the caustic brine can be used to saturate diluted brine. The chlorine contains oxygen and must often be purified by liquefaction and evaporation.|$|R
5000|$|These {{closed-loop}} {{steam engines}} had no firebox. The boiler was jacketed by a container loaded with about 5 tons of <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> (sodium hydroxide). When water or steam {{came in contact}} with the <b>caustic</b> <b>soda,</b> it would generate heat [...] - [...] enough to actually run the boiler and generate more steam. Steam emanating from the boiler would be fed through pistons to propel the locomotive forward, and the exhaust steam from the pistons would be fed into the <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> to continue the cycle. These vehicles were virtually silent, because the steam was not released into the atmosphere.|$|R

40|$|Investigations on the {{activation}} of cellulose by mixed solutions of <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> and urea are reported. The structural effects of those solutions oil various dissolving pulps are studied by C- 13 -CP/MAS-NMR spectroscopy. In {{a series of}} steeping lyes, the concentration of NaOH was varied in a range from 0 % to 8 % and the urea-concentration in a range from 15 % to 40 % at ambient temperature and - 25 degrees C. Using solely the single NaOH or urea solutions in the concentration ranges given above, no or only minor structural changes were found. In contrast to that, the cellulose I structure was partially or completely destroyed by using the bicomponent solution with urea added to <b>caustic</b> <b>soda.</b> The structural effect of the bicomponent solutions is comparable with the effect of solely <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> solutions of approx. 10 % to 18 % NaOH. However, the C- 13 -CP/MAS-NMR-spectra from the bicomponem pretreated samples indicate a structure different from the usual ordered structures of sodium cellulose I or II, namely a special urea-NaOH-cellu lose complex. The results show that for cellulose activation the NaOH concentration of the <b>caustic</b> <b>soda</b> can be remarkably reduced by adding urea.
