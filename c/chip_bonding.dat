Although the reliability test results have been positive and no failure is attributed to voids, the process development work during the last quarter has focused on understanding how these form and how to reduce them. High feed pressure, slow nozzle speed and lower viscosity reduce void formation. Nozzle design changes have been identified. One change will increase the shearing of the paste during feed, thus reducing the viscosity, a second change will allow higher feed pressures. <b>Chip</b> <b>bonding</b> process development has focused on correlating bonding results between the IBM in-house chip bonder made by Research Devices, Inc. and the Universal development bond tool.

40|$|Inkjet {{printing}} technology has merits such as simple manufacturing process, low cost, small pollution source and high productivity. It is utilized {{in the production}} of printed electronics, Radio Frequency (RF) devices and flexible displays [1 - 2]. A new application includes bump fabrication to electrically connect chip and substrate on semiconductor packages. In practice, wire bonding technology has been mainly used for these electrical connections, which can be bonded at a low price. At higher frequencies, however, the wire bonding technique reaches the limit for RF applications, because the bonding wire generates a parasitic inductance that degrades the transmission characteristics. On the other hand, flip <b>chip</b> <b>bonding</b> technology has been developed to overcome the disadvantages of wire bonding [3]. Although flip <b>chip</b> <b>bonding</b> technology can be performed minimizing the distance between chip and substrate, the bump fabrication process is very complex. To solve the disadvantage of flip-chip bonding, we propose a new technique, using inkjet-printed bump technology.
