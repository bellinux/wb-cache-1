40|$|Co-receptors add {{complexity}} to cell-cell signaling systems. The secreted semaphorin 3 s (Sema 3 s) {{require a}} co-receptor, neuropilin (Nrp), to signal through plexin As (PlxnAs) in functions ranging from axon guidance to bone homeostasis, but {{the role of}} the co-receptor is obscure. Here we present the low-resolution crystal structure of a mouse semaphorin-plexin-Nrp complex alongside unliganded component structures. Dimeric semaphorin, two copies of plexin and two copies of Nrp are arranged as a dimer of heterotrimers. In each heterotrimer subcomplex, semaphorin contacts plexin, similar to in co-receptor-independent signaling complexes. The Nrp 1 s <b>cross</b> <b>brace</b> the <b>assembly,</b> bridging between sema domains of the Sema 3 A and PlxnA 2 subunits from the two heterotrimers. Biophysical and cellular analyses confirm that this Nrp binding mode stabilizes a canonical, but weakened, Sema 3 -PlxnA interaction, adding co-receptor control over the mechanism by which receptor dimerization and/or oligomerization triggers signaling. © 2012 Nature America, Inc.

40|$|Key words: <b>cross</b> <b>bracing,</b> {{hysteretic}} curve, fracture ductility, performance-based design. Abstract. Steel braces {{are widely}} used in seismic retrofit of buildings. However, their tendency of buckling under compression impairs their efficacy. In this paper, characteristics of a <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> with rigid intersection, including its bearing capacity, hysteretic property and fracture ductility are investigated. With the analysis results, performance-based design requirements of a steel <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> are proposed based on its width-thickness ratio and effective slenderness ratio...|$|R
50|$|In construction, <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> is {{a system}} {{utilized}} to reinforce building structures in which diagonal supports intersect. <b>Cross</b> <b>bracing</b> can increase a building’s capability to withstand seismic activity. Bracing is important in earthquake resistant buildings because it helps keep a structure standing. <b>Cross</b> <b>bracing</b> is usually seen with two diagonal supports placed in an X shaped manner; these support compression and tension forces. Depending on the forces, one brace may be in tension while the other is slack. It helps make buildings sturdier {{and more likely to}} withstand lateral forces. <b>Cross</b> <b>bracing</b> can be applied to any rectangular frame structure, such as chairs and bookshelves. In steel construction, steel cables may be used due to their great resistance to tension (although not resistant at all to compression). The common uses for <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> includes bridge (side) supports, along with structural foundations. This method of construction maximizes the weight of the load a structure is able to support.|$|R

30|$|So far, most {{research}} has been done on <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> systems; while little attention has been given to other bracing arrangements and evaluating their seismic behavior. Despite experiments and studies on <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> systems, there exist uncertainties about the exact nonlinear behavior of these systems. To shed light on this significant issue, using modeling, analysis by finite element method, and considering various ratios of height to length of the wall and evaluating nonlinear responses of these systems, we decided to investigate several bracing systems with different arrangements including cross, chevron and K-shape bracings.|$|R
