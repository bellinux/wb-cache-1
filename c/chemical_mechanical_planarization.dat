This has led to a number of publications on the toxicological effects of nanoceria in ecological receptor species, but only limited information is available on possible environmental releases, concentrations in environmental media, or environmental transformations. Increasing material flows of nanoceria in many applications is likely to result in increasing releases to air, water and soils however; insufficient information was available to estimate aquatic exposures that would result in acute or chronic toxicity. The purpose of this review is to identify which areas are lacking in data to perform either regional or site specific ecological risk assessments. While estimates can be made for releases from use as a diesel fuel additive, and predicted toxicity is low in most terrestrial species tested to date, estimates for releases from other uses are difficult at this stage. We recommend that future studies focus on environmentally realistic exposures that take into account potential environmental transformations of the nanoceria surface as well as chronic toxicity studies in benthic aquatic organisms, soil invertebrates and microorganisms...|$|R

Nanoceria's redox properties can be tuned by choice of method of preparation, particle size, nature and level of dopant, particle shape and surface chemistry. The two oxidation states of the cerium element in the lattice make possible the formation of oxygen vacancies which are essential to the high reactivity of the material, its oxygen buffering capability and thus its ability to act as a catalyst for both oxidation and reduction reactions.

40|$|Because of {{the nature}} of their processes, {{semiconductor}} fabrication facilities use a large amount of water for the processing of microchips. This also means that a large amount of wastewater is discharged from semiconductor facilities. Because of this, there is a drive in the industry towards decreasing water consumption and wastewater discharge by optimizing processes and minimizing water usage, as well as by recycling and reusing wastewaters. The majority of aqueous wastewaters in semiconductor manufacturing come from rinse processes used after chemical baths during cleaning and also from <b>chemical</b> and <b>mechanical</b> <b>planarization</b> processes. This work focuses on the use of biological treatment as a chemical and energy efficient alternative for treating waste streams containing isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and copper. A consortium of bacteria capable of degrading IPA was selected and acclimated. This consortium was immobilized on activated carbon and used as packing for a fluidized-bed reactor. The bioreactor was able to degrade more than 95 % of the IPA in the feed stream. In addition, the behavior of the bioreactor system was studied under transient feed conditions by introducing a series of pH and IPA shocks after the reactor had reached steady state. A 5 X (500 ppm) step change of IPA in the feed caused the effluent IPA concentration in the reactor to increase ∼ 12 %. After the step change was finished, the reactor quickly recovered to its steady state level. Similarly, a step change decrease in pH of the feed from 7 to 4 caused an ∼ 11 % increase in effluent IPA concentration. A mathematical model based on diffusion and biodegradation of IPA through the biofilm as well as adsorption of IPA on the activated carbon was developed and tested. The model was able to predict the transient changes in IPA feed concentration very well. Finally, building upon the results of previous research studying the biosorption of copper on immobilized cells, a system for the simultaneous removal of IPA and copper was tested experimentally. After acclimation, the system was able to treat effectively a model wastewater containing 100 ppm of IPA and 50 ppm of copper...|$|R
40|$|Contact image analysis, Tool life Abstract. <b>Chemical</b> <b>mechanical</b> {{polishing}} / <b>planarization</b> (CMP) is a {{key technology}} for fabricating high-efficient semiconductor devices, and the CMP characteristics (removal rate and accuracy, etc.) is depended on the various consumables represented by slurry, polishing pad and dresser used in the CMP process. Currently, in the pad, there are many studies that have pointed the evaluation methodology and {{the correlation between the}} pad surface asperity and the CMP characteristics. On the other hand, the dresser {{is one of the most}} important consumables because the dresser can control the pad surface asperity, and the diamond grains electrodeposited dresser (diamond dresser) is frequently used. One drawback point of the diamond dresser is that the dressing performance declines owing to the deterioration of the diamond grains. Previously, we have developed a novel flexible fiber dresser that would ensure high performance and longer life of tools, and we have reported the fundamental characteristics by the flexible fiber dresser compared with that of the diamond dresser. In this paper, we will show the results of tool life evaluation of the flexible fiber dresser using a contact image analysis method. As a result, the flexible fiber dresser can be continuously used over 35 hours. Furthermore, the result of having examined the stability of the removal rate of a silicon wafer is reported. Therefore, we found that the flexible fiber dresser is one of the most effective dressing methods for the polishing pad...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} series of studies relating to kinetics and kinematics of inter-layer dielectric and metal <b>chemical</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>planarization</b> processes. These are also evaluated with the purposes of minimizing environmental and cost of ownership impact. The first study is performed to obtain the real-time substrate temperature during the polishing process and is specifically intended to understand the temperature distribution across the polishing wafer during the <b>chemical</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>planarization</b> process. Later, this technique is implemented to study the effect of slurry injection position for optimum slurry usage. It is known that the performance of <b>chemical</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>planarization</b> depends significantly on the polishing pad and the kinematics involved in the process. Variations in pad material and pad grooving type as well as pressure and sliding velocity can affect polishing performance. One study in this dissertation investigates thermoset and thermoplastic pad materials with different grooving methods and patterns. The study is conducted on multiple pressure and sliding velocity variations to understand the characteristic of each pad. The analysis method elaborated in this study can be applied generically. A subsequent study focuses in a slurry characterization technique. Slurry, a critical component in <b>chemical</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>planarization,</b> is typically a water-based dispersion of fine abrasive particles with various additives to control material removal rate and microscratches. Simultaneous turbidity and low angle light scattering methods under well-defined mixing conditions are shown to quantify the stability of abrasive particle from aggregations. Further contribution of this dissertation involves studies related to the spectral analysis of raw shear force and down force data obtained during <b>chemical</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>planarization.</b> These studies implemented Fast Fourier Transforms to convert force data from time to frequency domain. A study is performed to detect the presence of larger, defect-causing particles during polishing.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Chemical</b> <b>mechanical</b> {{polishing}} (CMP) {{has been}} used as planarization process in the fabrication of semiconductor devices. The CMP process is required to planarize the overburden film in an interconnect process by high relative velocity between head and platen, high pressure of head and chemical effects of an aqueous slurry. But, a variety of defects such as dishing, delamination and metal layer peering are caused by CMP factors such as high pressure, pad bending and strong chemical effect. The electrical energy of the electro-chemical <b>mechanical</b> <b>planarization</b> (ECMP) dissolves copper (Cu) solid into copper ions electrochemically in an aqueous electrolyte. The dissolved copper complex layer or passivation layer is removed by the mechanical abrasions of polishing pad and abrasive. Therefore the ECMP process realizes low pressure processing of soft metals to reduce defects comparing to traditional CMP process. But, if projected metal patterns were removed and not remained on whole wafer surface in final processing stage, Cu layer could not be removed by ECMP process. The two-step process consists of the ECMP and the conventional CMP used in micro patterned Cu wafers. First, the ECMP process removed several tens µm of bulk copper on Cu patterned wafer within shorter process time than the Cu CMP. Next, residual Cu layer was completely removed by the Cu CMP under low pressure. Total time and process defects are extremely reduced by the two-step process...|$|R
