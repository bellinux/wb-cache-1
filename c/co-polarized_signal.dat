40|$|Abstract: Detection of {{subsurface}} {{returns from}} the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) on the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite were demonstrated. Despite the coarse range resolution of this aerosol lidar, evidence of subsurface scattering was observed as a delay and broadening of the cross-polarized signal relative to the <b>co-polarized</b> <b>signal</b> in the three near-surface range bins. These two effects contributed to an increased depolarization at the nominal depth of 25 m. These features were all correlated with near-surface chlorophyll concentrations. An increase in the depolarization was also seen {{at a depth of}} 50 m under certain conditions, suggesting that chlorophyll concentration at that depth could be estimated if an appropriate retrieval technique can be developed. At greater depths, the signal is dominated by the temporal response of the detectors, which was approximated by an analytical expression. The depolarization caused by aerosols in the atmosphere was calculated and eliminated as a possible artifact...|$|E
40|$|Nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{exhibit a}} saturable nonlinearity, nonlocal {{in time and}} in space, owing to light-induced reorientation of the molecular director. In such media, (2 + 1) -dimensional spatial solitons can be obtained at milliwatt-power levels and confine weaker <b>co-polarized</b> <b>signals</b> of different wavelengths, employing either coherent or partially incoherent excitations. Our experimental observations of solitons and related phenomena, ranging from angular steering to mutual interactions, are reviewed. Models are briefly discussed and used to predict and interpret the results...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{based on}} a fit of the single-scattering Integral Equation Method (IEM) was developed to provide estimation of soil moisture and surface roughness parameter (a combination of rms roughness height and surface power spectrum) from quad-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements. This algorithm was applied {{to a series of}} measurements acquired at L-band (1. 25 GHz) from both AIRSAR (Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and SIR-C (Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C) over a well- managed watershed in southwest Oklahoma. Prior to its application for soil moisture inversion, a good agreement was found between the single-scattering IEM simulations and the L band measurements of SIR-C and AIRSAR over a wide range of soil moisture and surface roughness conditions. The sensitivity of soil moisture variation to the <b>co-polarized</b> <b>signals</b> were then examined under the consideration of the calibration accuracy of various components of SAR measurements. It was found that the two co-polarized backscattering coefficients and their combinations would provide the best input to the algorithm for estimation of soil moisture and roughness parameter. Application of the inversion algorithm to the co-polarized measurements of both AIRSAR and SIR-C resulted in estimated values of soil moisture and roughness parameter for bare and short-vegetated fields that compared favorably with those sampled on the ground. The root-mean-square (rms) errors of the comparison were found to be 3. 4 % and 1. 9 dB for soil moisture and surface roughness parameter, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{crystals}} (LC) {{are excellent}} media for {{the exploration of}} nonlinear phenomena, particularly due to their high and nonlocal response to electric and magnetic fields. Besides the fundamental interest, the field-induced reorientation of LC molecules is widely used in display applications and is promising for optical signals processing such as attenuators, tunable lens and smart-windows. Recently, {{a great deal of}} attention has been dedicated to spatial (2 + 1) D optical solitons in nematic liquid crystals, the so called nematicons. Nematicons are diffractionless self-confined light beams, that is, guided by their own waveguide in the dielectric. Specifically, diffraction is balanced out by self-focusing through the reorientational nonlinearity. Moreover, owing to the highly nonlocal character of the response, nematicons are stable and robust to external perturbations. Being self-induced graded-index guides for <b>co-polarized</b> <b>signals,</b> nematicons are an avenue to a wide range of all-optical devices and reconfigurable routers. When the electric field and the average alignment of molecules are normal to each other, the reorientational response presents a threshold in power before the material properties get modified by the impinging light. This dissertation deals with the investigation of beam self-trapping near such threshold in nematic liquid crystals, a configuration scarcely explored in the existing literature. The first chapter introduces the main features of liquid crystals and of nematicons in threshold-free geometries, including self-focusing, self-trapping and self-steering. Tthe second chapter discusses how self-focusing in the presence of threshold provides optical bistability and hysteresis in beam width versus power, due to step-like nonlinear response with excitation. This is indeed the first report on bistability with propagating beams and the first experimental demonstration of soliton bistability. The third chapter studies nematicon propagation near the threshold, in bias-free cells allowing the direct observation of beam-walk-off: combining self-steering and the inherent anisotropy of liquid crystals, the system is capable of switching from positive to negative refraction as power changes. This is the first demonstration of such a power controlled transition in refraction, which, besides the other, allows optimizing all-optical routers based on nematicons, as optical self-steering is maximized...|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} content of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data significantly {{included in the}} radiometric polarization channels, hence polarimetric SAR data should be analyzed in relation with target structure. The importance of the phase difference between two <b>co-polarized</b> scattered <b>signals</b> due to the possible association between the biophysical parameters and the measured Polarization Phase Difference (PPD) statistics of the backscattered signal recorded components has been recognized in geophysical remote sensing. This paper examines two Radarsat- 2 images statistics of the phase difference to describe the feasibility of relationship with the physical properties of scattering targets and tries to understand relevance of PPD statistics with various types of forest fields. As well as variation of incidence angle due to affecting on PPD statistics is investigated. The experimental forest pieces {{that are used in}} this research are characterized white pine (Pinus strobus L.), red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench Voss), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill) B. S. P.), poplar (Populus L.), red oak (Quercus rubra L.), aspen and ground vegetation. The experimental results show that despite of biophysical parameters have a wide diversity, PPD statistics are almost the same. Forest fields distributions as distributed targets have close to zero means regardless of the incidence angle. Also, The PPD distribution are function of both target and sensor parameters, but for more appropriate examination related to PPD statistics the observations should made in the leaf-off season or in bands with lower frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”A {{technique}} {{to characterize the}} fields generated by a cell phone, and projected into an area inside a TEM cell for possible biological interaction studies is described. A double-ended monopole antenna is proposed as the lead signal inducer between the inside and the outside areas of the TEM cell. The coupling voltage at the TEM cell ports and the field distribution within the area under test (AUT) {{were found to be}} a function of the phone position, polarization, and dialing type. The measurements for a GSM 850 MHz cellular phone showed that the optimum setup is achievable when the phone is placed outside the TEM cell and <b>co-polarized</b> with the <b>signal</b> leader. An improvement of the field uniformity is possible {{with the use of a}} shorter signal leader but at the cost of decreased field strength. The proposed setup can be utilized in studies and experiments related to the radio frequency effects on biological cells and organs. 1...|$|R
