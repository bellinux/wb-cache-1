40|$|<b>Carriers</b> <b>of</b> {{haemophilia}} {{are known}} to have a wide range of clotting factor levels and bleeding symptoms. This study aimed at investigating whether <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> severe and moderate haemophilia had an increased bleeding tendency, compared with a control group, using a condensed version of a bleeding assessment tool developed by the Molecular and Clinical Markers for the Diagnosis and Management of Type 1 VWD study group (MCMDM- 1 VWD). One hundred and twenty-six genetically verified <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> severe and moderate haemophilia and 90 controls were interviewed regarding bleeding symptoms. A bleeding score of at least 4 was considered positive, indicating a significant bleeding tendency. Clotting factor levels were tested in the <b>carriers.</b> Nineteen <b>of</b> the women were <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> haemophilia B, with a mean factor (F) IX:C level of 0. 54 (± 0. 27) kIU/l, and 107 were <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> haemophilia A, with a mean FVIII:C level of 0. 74 (± 0. 32) kIU/l. The median bleeding score was 2 (- 3 - 12) among carriers and - 1 (- 3 - 8) among controls (P < 0. 001). The bleeding score was weakly correlated to clotting factor levels in <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> haemophilia A (rs = - 0. 36, P < 0. 001). We conclude that the bleeding tendency in our cohort <b>of</b> <b>carriers</b> differed significantly from that in the controls and that clotting factor levels might not be sufficient to predict the bleeding tendency...|$|R

5|$|LDLR {{mutations}} {{are more}} common in certain populations, presumably because of a genetic phenomenon known as the founder effect—they were founded by {{a small group of}} individuals, one or several of whom was a <b>carrier</b> <b>of</b> the mutation.

5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a <b>carrier</b> <b>of</b> phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{is one of}} the dog breeds {{affected}} by progressive retinal atrophy. It has the most common form, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes the rods and cones in the retina of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an autosomal recessive trait and a dog can be a <b>carrier</b> <b>of</b> the affected gene without developing the condition.|$|E

5|$|Tonsillectomy {{may be a}} {{reasonable}} preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year).

Treating people who have been exposed but who are without symptoms is not recommended. Treating people who are carriers of GAS is not recommended as the risk of spread and complications is low.|$|E

5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber <b>carrier</b> <b>of</b> similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E
5|$|Billie is the {{youngest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal and her powers were inherited from her maternal grandmother, making Helen a <b>carrier</b> <b>of</b> the genes determining magical ability. Billie has the basic abilities of a witch, including casting spells, performing rituals, brewing potions, scrying for lost people or objects using of a crystal pendant, and communicating with the dead. She also has the power of telekinesis and later develops the ability to warp reality using a power known as projection. She is shown mastering her original powers very easily and adapting them using unconventional methods, such as attaching a large quartz crystal to her computer's mouse to scry through a GPS system. Her telekinesis enables her to perform acrobatic moves, such as backflips. However, she experiences difficulty using her power of projection due to her fear of hurting others. Billie eventually masters this power, and by the series finale she can easily travel through time.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{launched}} in late 1921, {{but the first}} ship, , was cancelled {{in accordance with the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty before it could be completed, and was used in experiments testing the effectiveness of its armor scheme before being scuttled in the Bungo Channel.

The carrier supported Japanese troops in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War of the late 1930s, and took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on Darwin, Australia, during the Dutch East Indies campaign. She was sunk during the Battle of Midway in 1942.|$|E

40|$|Background <b>Carriers</b> <b>of</b> Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) and Becker {{muscular dystrophy}} (BMD) may show muscle weakness or dilated cardiomyopathy. Studies focusing on skeletal-muscle involvement were done before DNA analysis was possible. We undertook a cross-sectional study {{in a population}} <b>of</b> definite <b>carriers</b> to estimate the proportion and to assess the clinical profile <b>of</b> <b>carriers</b> with symptoms. We also assessed a possible correlation between genotype and phenotype. Methods <b>Carriers</b> <b>of</b> DMD and BMD, aged 18 - 60 years, were traced through the files of the central register kept at the Department of Human Genetics in Leiden, Netherlands. For each carrier who agreed to participate a medical history was taken, and muscle-strength assessment by hand-held dynamometry and manual muscle testing and cardiological assessment were done. Findings 129 <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> muscular dystrophy (85 DMD, 44 BMD) participated in the study. In 90 women from 52 (70 %) families, 37 different mutations were found. 28 (22 %) women had symptoms. 22 (17 %) had muscle weakness, varying from mild to moderately severe, Muscle weakness was found in <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> DMD and BMD, but dilated cardiomyopathy was found only in seven (8 %) <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> DMD, of whom one had concomitant muscle weakness. There was an unexpectedly high proportion of left-ventricle dilation (18 %). No genotype-phenotype correlation was found. Interpretation Clinical manifestation of muscle weakness, dilated cardiomyopathy, or both {{can be found in}} about a fifth <b>of</b> <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> DMD and BMD. If left-ventricle dilation is taken into account, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>carriers</b> with symptoms is even higher, amounting to 40 %...|$|R
