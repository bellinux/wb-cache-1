5|$|Lavelli {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Hudson, Ohio, a small town in the northeastern part of the state. Both of his parents were Italian immigrants. His father Angelo Lavelli was a {{blacksmith}} who made shoes for horses on nearby farms. As a child, he practiced catching by throwing baseballs against walls and trying to <b>catch</b> <b>them</b> when they bounced back. He liked to have friends throw ping-pong balls at him {{to see if he could}} <b>catch</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Swifts {{spend most}} of their time in flight. Few birds have the {{necessary}} speed and agility to <b>catch</b> <b>them,</b> hobbies being the main exception. The nest sites are also usually sufficiently inaccessible to be beyond the reach of snakes or mammalian predators.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males are}} less ready to pursue and less {{efficient}} at catching than adult females, especially against larger prey. Males are quite effective against small web spiders, and reluctant to tackle large ones although they <b>catch</b> <b>them</b> in about 50% of attempts. Against other jumping spiders, males do not pursue large ones and pursue about 48% of small ones, catching 84% of those they pursue. Males of Portia do not build large webs for catching prey ("capture webs").|$|E

5|$|Bumblebees, {{despite their}} ability to sting, are eaten by certain predators. Nests may be dug up by badgers and eaten whole, {{including}} any adults present. Adults are preyed upon by robber flies and beewolves in North America. In Europe, birds including bee-eaters and shrikes capture adult bumblebees on the wing; smaller birds such as great tits also occasionally learn to take bumblebees, while camouflaged crab spiders <b>catch</b> <b>them</b> as they visit flowers.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of deep-freeze and the {{air-conditioned}} hypermarché, these seasonal variations are less marked than hitherto, {{but they are still}} observed, in some cases due to legal restrictions. Crayfish, for example, have a short season and it is illegal to <b>catch</b> <b>them</b> out of season. Moreover, they do not freeze well.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, the Prussian {{ships were}} ready for action and the ice had receded far enough that Prince Adalbert ordered Jachmann to conduct a {{reconnaissance}} of the blockading force on 16 March. In the meantime, Dockum's squadron had arrived off Swinemünde two days before. Arcona and Nymphe patrolled off Greifswald, but the weather was very poor, with snow showers hampering visibility. The Prussian gunboats, led by the paddle steamer , remained closer to Swinemünde. Jachmann spotted three vessels at around 15:30, but {{there was not enough}} time before dark to <b>catch</b> <b>them.</b> Instead, Jachmann turned back to Swinemünde, intending to try again the following day.|$|E

5|$|On the song, Ty croons {{about him}} juggling a {{relationship}} between two different women, and being worried about one of them finding out about the other. Overall, the two artists detail multiple girls attempting to <b>catch</b> <b>them</b> in the act cheating, causing them to be on edge. The song premiered on Rap Radar on August 28, 2013, where {{it was announced that}} it would be released as a single on September 10, 2013. As promised, on September 10, 2013, the song was released for digital download as the first single from Ty's debut EP Beach House EP on Amazon.com.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Prix was contested by eleven {{teams with}} two drivers each. The teams (also known as constructors) were Ferrari, McLaren, Williams, Benetton, BAR, Jordan, Arrows, Sauber, Jaguar, Minardi and Prost. Before the race, both the Drivers' Championship and Constructors' Championship were already settled, with Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher having claimed the Drivers' Championship two rounds {{earlier in the}} Hungarian Grand Prix and Ferrari took the Constructors' Championship at the same event, with McLaren too many points behind {{to be able to}} <b>catch</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|After rescuing the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it {{initially}} fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, also mistaking {{it for a}} real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik {{in retaliation}} and says that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper kidnaps Flik and flees. After the Circus Bugs fail to <b>catch</b> <b>them,</b> Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering it is real, and is captured and fed to its chicks.|$|E

5|$|All {{cetaceans}} are carnivorous and predatory. Toothed whales mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves. Some may forage with {{other kinds of}} animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to <b>catch</b> <b>them</b> more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it. Other whales with a blunt snout and reduced dentition rely on suction feeding. Though carnivorous, they house gut flora {{similar to that of}} terrestrial herbivores, probably a remnant of their herbivorous ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are {{fast enough to}} <b>catch</b> <b>them.</b> These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|E
5|$|Banquo is in a {{third of}} the play's scenes, as both a human and a ghost. As {{significant}} as he is to the plot, he has fewer lines than the relatively insignificant Ross, a Scottish nobleman who survives the play. In the second scene of the play, King Duncan describes the manner in which Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, and Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, bravely led his army against invaders, fighting side by side. In the next scene, Banquo and Macbeth, returning from the battle together, encounter the Three Witches, who predict that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor, and then king. Banquo, sceptical of the witches, challenges them to predict his own future, and they foretell that Banquo will never himself take the throne, but will beget a line of kings. Banquo remains sceptical after the encounter, wondering aloud if evil can ever speak the truth. He warns Macbeth that evil will offer men a small, hopeful truth only to <b>catch</b> <b>them</b> in a deadly trap.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Pokémon Theme" [...] (also {{known as}} [...] "Gotta <b>Catch</b> <b>'Em</b> All") {{is a song}} written by John Siegler and John Loeffler and {{performed}} by Jason Paige. It was the theme song for the first season of the English adaptation of the Pokémon anime. Since its release, the song has been virtually synonymous with the Pokémon franchise because the line [...] "Gotta <b>Catch</b> <b>'Em</b> All" [...] has become its official slogan.|$|R

Then he licked his chops and Hooty the Owl snapped his bill, just as if they were tasting tender little Bob Whites that very minute. It made the willful little Breeze shiver to see them. Pretty soon they started on towards the Brown Pasture.|$|R

5|$|Father John {{returns to}} the red-light {{district}} and speaks to a prostitute named Miriam (Greta Oglesby), who suggests a powerful pimp named James St. Clair (Ansa Akyea) might know about the woman. As they speak in a bar, the mysterious prostitute enters and solicits a john (Patrick Coyle), who leaves with her immediately. As she goes, Father John catches {{a glimpse of the}} crucifix she is wearing and tries to chase her down. She leaves in the john's car before he can <b>catch</b> <b>them,</b> but he writes down the license plate as they drive off. Back at church, his sermons start to grow more unorthodox, and Father Ralph warns him that his unusual church manner and trips to the red-light district have the archbishop concerned. Meanwhile, Father John is contacted by his ex-girlfriend Nadine Brennan (Amy Matthews), who tells him she is divorcing her husband and still harbors romantic feelings for Father John.|$|E
5|$|Historian Samuel E. Morison {{noted in}} 1949 that Spruance was {{subjected}} to much criticism for not pursuing the retreating Japanese, thus allowing their surface fleet to escape. Clay Blair argued in 1975 that had Spruance pressed on, {{he would have been}} unable to launch his aircraft after nightfall, and his cruisers would have been overwhelmed by Yamamoto's powerful surface units, including Yamato. Furthermore, the American air groups had suffered considerable losses, including most of their torpedo bombers. This made it unlikely that they would be effective in an airstrike against the Japanese battleships, even if they had managed to <b>catch</b> <b>them</b> during daytime. Also, by this time Spruance's destroyers were critically low on fuel.|$|E
5|$|Homer and {{his group}} begin {{guarding}} the museum. Grampa and his friends from the retirement home volunteer to help, but Homer tells them to leave because they are too old. A few minutes later, Homer sees a group of teenagers drinking beer. He leaves his post to intervene and <b>catch</b> <b>them,</b> but immediately ends up getting drunk with them instead. While Homer's guard is down, the cat burglar sneaks past and steals the zirconia. Homer is blamed and pelted with vegetables by the unforgiving townspeople. Later that day, Grampa stops by the Simpsons' house and tells everybody that he knows who the cat burglar is: a resident in the local retirement home named Molloy.|$|E

5|$|At Gibraltar, {{the only}} ship in harbour was the small sloop-of-war HMS Calpe under Captain George Dundas, who on {{sighting}} the French squadron immediately sent word to Saumarez off Cadiz. The message arrived on 5 July, delivered by Lieutenant Richard Janvrin {{in a small}} boat. The admiral, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile, immediately gathered his ships and sailed eastwards to investigate. He had only six ships of the line as one, HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, was on detached duty {{at the mouth of the}} Guadalquivir River with the brig HMS Pasley. Saumarez sent messages in the frigate HMS Thames recalling Keats, who followed Saumarez towards Algeciras, and was in sight of the admiral's ship on the horizon at dawn on 6 July. However, after hearing an inaccurate report from an American merchant ship that Linois had already sailed from Algeciras, Keats reasoned that the French would have turned eastwards for Toulon and thus he would be too late to <b>catch</b> <b>them.</b> He therefore resolved to return to his station observing the Spanish at Cadiz, retaining Pasley and Thames.|$|E
5|$|Raghuveer {{discovers that}} Harsha is the reincarnation of the warrior. He murders Indu's father and frames Harsha, causing Indu to hate Harsha. As Raghuveer and Indu leave in a helicopter, Harsha tries to <b>catch</b> <b>them</b> but fails; {{falling into a}} lake, he faces a near-death {{experience}} and learns about his past life in 1609. In that year, Emperor Sher Khan is preparing to invade the kingdom of Udayghar when he hears of the brave warrior Kala Bhairava (Harsha), commander of the Udayghad army. King Vikram Singh's daughter, Mithravindha Devi (Indu), loves Bhairava, but he holds himself back. Her cousin, Ranadev Billa (Raghuveer), lusts after Mithra and plans a competition between himself and Bhairava; the winner will marry her and the loser will be banished from Udayghad. Bhairava's victory leads to Ranadev's banishment. Vikram Singh, however, secretly requests that Bhairava not marry his daughter, because Bhairava has a high chance of dying in battle, {{and he does not}} wish to see Mithra widowed. Though shocked, Bhirava concedes to the king's request and publicly declines to marry Mithra, leaving her distraught.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins as police {{officers}} and Reddick discuss the criminal duo and ways to <b>catch</b> <b>them.</b> As the song begins, Jay-Z is seen driving a gunmetal grey Aston Martin while Beyoncé sits in the passenger seat. As they drive through the sepia sands of Mexico, clips of the police {{from the beginning of}} the video are cut into the scene. As Jay-Z and Beyoncé pull over to a hotel, they cover the car to avoid notice from the police. As Beyoncé and Jay-Z count money in the bedroom, the police discover their hiding place and go upstairs only to find that the two have fled the scene in their car. Scenes of Beyoncé and Jay-Z at a Mexican bar are inter-cut with scenes of an intimate time in a phone-booth; behind the phone booth, spray-painted onto a wall is a tribute to Tupac Shakur. The duo again elude the police who are following one step behind. After Beyoncé performs her verse in an empty pool, the police form a blockade on the highway in an attempt to catch her and Jay-Z, only to be stumped again as two gas station attendant decoys are found driving the car. The video ends as Beyoncé and Jay-Z light a bonfire on the beach and drive away in a different car.|$|E
