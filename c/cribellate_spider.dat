5000|$|Nigma walckenaeri is a green <b>cribellate</b> <b>spider</b> {{up to five}} millimetres long, {{the largest}} of the family Dictynidae. While most of the body is a {{somewhat}} yellowish, the abdomen is a shining green, which makes it rather distinct and hard to confuse with other species. The green color makes it almost invisible. Males have an elevated head region. From August to October these spiders can be found in gardens or on walls - often on big leaves such as lilac or feral grapevine. The spider catches insects, sometimes larger than itself, in its web, which it builds on the surface of leaves. The female hides the 7-millimetre long egg sac on a place distant from its retreat.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePrey {{captured}} by a predator may attract kleptoparasites which could {{significantly reduce the}} amount of food consumed. Stegodyphus lineatus, a <b>cribellate</b> <b>spider,</b> builds an energetically costly web. Ants raid the webs of S. lineatus to steal prey and behave as kleptoparasites. We investigated ant raids in a natural population of S. lineatus and their influence on the spider's foraging behaviour. Considering spiders that had captured a prey, 31. 2 % suffered an ant raid within 24 h after the prey capture. Experimental tests showed that the response to ant raid is to delay web rebuilding and this was independent of a spider's previous foraging success. There was a tendency for spiders that were exposed to ants to build larger webs. Neither prey-handling duration nor prey consumption was modified after exposure to ants. These results suggest that Stegodyphus lineatus adapt its webbuilding behaviour in response to the risk of kleptoparasitism...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{demonstrate}} the impressive adhesive qualities of uloborid spider orb-web capture when dry, which are lost when the nano-filament threads are wetted. A force sensor with a 50 nN– 1 mN detection sensitively {{allowed us to}} measure quantitatively the stress–strain characteristics of native silk threads in both the original dry state and after wetting by controlled application of water mist with droplet sizes ranging between 3 and 5 μm and densities ranging between 104 and 105 per mm 3. Stress forces of between 1 and 5 μN/μm 2 in the native, dry multifilament thread puffs were reduced to between 0. 1 and 0. 5 μN/μm 2 in the wetted collapsed state, with strain displacements reducing from between 2 and 5 mm in the dry to 0. 10 – 0. 12 mm in the wetted states. We conclude that wetting cribellate threads reduce their van der Waals adhesion with implications on the thread’s adhesive strength under tension. This should be considered when discussing the evolutionary transitions of capture silks from the ancestral dry-state nano-filaments of the <b>cribellate</b> <b>spider</b> taxa to the wet-state glue-droplets of the ecribellate taxa...|$|E

50|$|In spiders, the calamistrum is {{a row of}} {{specialized}} leg bristles used to comb out fine bands of silk. It is only found on <b>cribellate</b> <b>spiders,</b> that is, spiders that possess the spinning organ known as the cribellum. The calamistrum and cribellum are used to form the hackled bands of silk which are characteristic of the webs of these spiders. The calamistrum is found on the upper margin of the metatarsus of the hind legs. Each bristle of the calamistrum is serrated {{on one side and}} smooth on the other.|$|R
40|$|During {{its life}} cycle, the <b>cribellate</b> <b>spider</b> Austrochilus sp. {{passes through the}} ecri­bellate nymphal, or spiderling stage (= the first instar, after leaving the egg sac), which has three pairs of spinnerets. According to the {{position}} and distribution of spigots on the spinnerets, these spigots {{are assumed to be}} connected to glandu­lae ampullaceae major, glandulae ampullaceae minor, glandulae piriformes and glan­dulae aciniformes. Such a spinning apparatus allows spiderlings to make drag­lines, attachment discs and silk for the molting platform. The cribellum, just like the calamistrum, is not developed in this stage. Instead the precribellum is present, which is similar to spinnerets in its shape (two protuberances divided by a groove and the presence of setae that look like spigots), but with a cuticle similar to the cribellum. The spinning apparatus of Austrochilus sp. shows one possible way in which the transformation of the anterior median spinnerets into the cribellum could have occurred during the evolution of silk-producing organs. In the following nymphal stage, the cribellum, the calamistrum and also the pa­racribellum are developed. Spiders in this stage are capable, after dispersal, of weaving complete webs, which serve as snares as well as retreats. The spigots of the paracribellum are on the posterior median and posterior lateral spinnerets...|$|E
50|$|Although cribellate and non-cribellate orb weavers {{had earlier}} {{been placed in}} the same taxon (from at least 1789), the two kinds of orb weaver were placed in {{separate}} taxa after the possession of a cribellum was prioritized over {{the form of the}} web. Following John Blackwall in 1841 and Philipp Bertkau in 1878, for a long time the majority of araneologists accepted spiders with a cribellum as a coherent taxon, Cribellatae. Many also held that <b>cribellate</b> and ecribellate <b>spiders</b> had separately evolved orb webs from other kinds of web. By the early 1970s, it had become apparent that <b>cribellate</b> <b>spiders</b> were a paraphyletic group, the cribellum being an ancient feature of araneomorph spiders that had been lost in many descendants, so that grouping spiders together based on the retention of this feature did not produce a monophyletic taxon.|$|R

50|$|They {{belong to}} the RTA clade of spiders, spiders that all have a Retrolateral Tibial Apophysis on the male pedipalp. A recent phylogenetic {{analysis}} places Psechridae as close relatives of the Lynx spiders (Oxyopidae), as well as wolf spiders (Lycosidae) and nursery web spiders (Pisauridae) (Agnarsson et al. 2013). With body lengths of up to 2 cm and funnel webs more than 1 m in diameter, {{they are among the}} biggest <b>cribellate</b> <b>spiders.</b> Psechrids construct <b>cribellate</b> webs and Fecenia construct webs that are similar to orb webs of Orbiculariae spiders, a remarkable example of evolutionary convergence (Blackledge et al. 2012, Agnarsson et al. 2013). Psechridae spiders are only found in SE Asia, where they occur in forests from lowland to altitudes exceeding 2000 m. Female Psechrus carry their egg-sac in the chelicerae, similar to their relatives, the ecribellate Pisauridae. They feature several characteristics normally found in ecribellate spiders, for example brood care behavior, and a colulus with no apparent function (Fang et al. 2000).|$|R

25|$|The abdomen has no {{appendages}} except {{from one}} to four (usually three) modified pairs of movable telescoping organs called spinnerets, which produce silk. Originally, the common ancestor of spiders had four pairs of spinnerets, with two pairs on the tenth body segment and two pairs on the eleventh body segment, located in the middle on the ventral side of the abdomen. The suborder Mesothelae is unique in having only two types of silk glands – {{thought to be the}} ancestral condition. All other spiders have the spinnerets further towards the posterior end of the body where they form a small cluster, and the anterior central spinnerets on the tenth segment are lost or reduced (suborder Mygalomorphae), or modified into a specialised and flattened plate called the cribellum (suborder Araneomorphae). The cribellum (usually separated into a left and a right half) produces a thread made up of hundreds to thousands of very fine dry silk fibers (about 10nm thick) around a few thicker core fibers, which then are combed into a woolly structure by using a group of specialized hairs (setae) on their fourth pair of legs. It is suspected their woolly silk is charged with static electricity, causing its fine fibres to attach to trapped prey. Once all araneomorph (modern) spiders had a cribellum, but today it only remains in the <b>cribellate</b> <b>spiders</b> (although it is sometimes missing even here), which are widespread around the world. Often, this plate lacks the ability to produce silk, and is then called the colulus; an organ that zoologists have not identified a function for. The colulus is reduced or absent in most species. The <b>cribellate</b> <b>spiders</b> were the first spiders to build specialized prey catching webs, later evolving into groups that used the spinnerets solely to make webs, instead using silk threads dotted with droplets of a sticky liquid (like pearls on a necklace) to capture small arthropods, and a few large species even small bats and birds. Other spiders do not build webs at all, but have become active hunters, like the highly successful jumping spiders.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of self-secreted materials {{are produced by}} insects and selection acts on this characteristic of production of self-secreting materials and increases the fitness of the animal. In some cases, the self-secreted material is directly applied, {{as in the case}} of ecribellate silk, spun by ecribellate spiders, to form sticky traps for prey, or it may be processed, {{as in the case of}} salivary excretion used for creation of paper by paper wasps, by blending it directly with wood pulp. Self-secreted materials may be processed in some cases. In <b>cribellate</b> <b>spiders,</b> silk produced by the spider are reworked in the cribellum to form fine sticky strands used for capturing prey. In other cases, the scale wax, produced on the bodies of honey bees, is gathered and blended with saliva, to form comb wax, the building material. Not all self-secreted materials are developed specifically for that purpose. For example, bird feathers are used for lining and insulation, a typical example being that of the female common eider duck (Somateria mollissima), which produces down feathers for lining its nest.|$|R
50|$|Dictynidae is {{a family}} of <b>cribellate</b> (hackled band-producing) <b>spiders.</b> Most spiders in this family build {{irregular}} webs close to or directly on the ground. Typically they create a tangle of silken fibers among several branches or stems of one plant.|$|R
40|$|The chaffinch, Fringilla coelebs, {{is one of}} a {{large number}} of birds from many {{families}} that use silk in the construction of their nests. Thirty-eight chaffinch nests collected from around the UK were examined to determine the nature and role of silk in nest construction. A regular survey of web, retreat and cocoon silk availability was made at a study site close to Glasgow, Scotland, over a 12 month period. The only spider web silk found in the nests was of the type produced by <b>cribellate</b> <b>spiders.</b> The majority of silk in nests, however, was spider cocoons, but there was no correlation between the amount of cocoon and web silk used. Nests with more lichen decoration contained more silk, and cocoon silk was particularly associated with the attachment of lichen. Nest construction at the study site took place from late April to mid-May. When nest building began, the availability of suitable web silk had doubled from its winter (lowest) level; however, its abundance continued to rise sharply until the end of May. The possible influence of silk availability on the timing of chaffinch nesting is discussed...|$|R

50|$|Along with Progradungula carraiensis and Macrogradungula moonya, odd-clawed spiders {{are one of}} {{the only}} three species {{belonging}} to the family Gradungulidae that are cribellate. Unlike other members of the family which are all cursorial (active roving hunters), these three species are ambush predators that construct snares. The snares are made from silk spun from specialized spinnerets known as the cribellum, and combed with the row of bristles (the calamistrum) on their fourth leg pair. Unlike normal spinnerets, the cribellum produces extremely fine silk that can easily entangle prey without the need for glue. The snares of all three species are distinctively ladder-shaped, in contrast to the snares of other <b>cribellate</b> <b>spiders</b> from other families.The larger part of the odd-clawed spider's web is composed of a network of supporting threads built up to 2 m above the ground. Two lateral support threads extend from this network and are attached to vegetation or ground below. These threads are held more or less parallel to each other by several short bridge threads. The spider spins the catching ladder in between them, composed of a loose irregular zigzag of cribellate thread. The catching ladder and the supporting webs are usually built far from the retreat of the spider in the tree hollows, as far as 3 m away. The retreat and the webs are connected to each other by a single sturdy thread.|$|R
