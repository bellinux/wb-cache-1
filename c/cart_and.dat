The Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages fall so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and bring in Otis Day and the Knights to provide live music. Wormer's wife attends at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette, a girl he met at the supermarket. They make out, but do not have sex because she passes out drunk.

5|$|The Mountain Eagle is {{the only}} feature film {{directed}} by Hitchcock that is considered a lost film, meaning that no prints of the film are known to exist. Six surviving stills are reproduced in François Truffaut's book. More stills have recently been found to exist, {{many of which are}} reproduced in Dan Auiler's book. A lobby card for the film was found in a box of broken frames at a flea market in Rowley, Massachusetts. In 2012, a set of 24 still photographs were found in an archive of one of Hitchcock's close friends. Although these images gave clues to the film and its story, they were taken on the set rather than being stills from the film itself. They were auctioned off in Los Angeles for $6,000 (£3,700). Hitchcock's notebooks were also found, documenting his journey to Obergurgl, by train, horse and <b>cart,</b> <b>and</b> by foot.|$|E
5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} {{contains}} two distinct groups of neurons. The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (<b>CART)</b> <b>and</b> has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated {{in part by}} leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.|$|E

5|$|Thurstan {{supported}} King Stephen after Henry I's {{death in}} 1135, and appeared at Stephen's first court at Easter held at Westminster. Thurstan negotiated a truce at Roxburgh in 1138 between England and Scotland. It was Thurstan who mustered the army which defeated the Scots at the Battle of the Standard on 22 August 1138 near Northallerton, Yorkshire. Thurstan {{did not take}} direct part in the battle., but he created the standard that gave the battle its name, by putting a ship's mast in a <b>cart</b> <b>and</b> hanging the banners of Saint Peter of York, Saint John of Beverley, and Saint Wilfrid of Ripon on the mast. The Scots had invaded attempting to aid the Empress Matilda, the daughter of Henry I and Stephen's rival for the throne. On 21 January 1140 Thurstan resigned his see and entered {{the order of the}} Cluniacs at Pontefract and he died there on 6 February 1140. He was buried in the church at Pontefract.|$|E
5|$|William Bury {{was born}} in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, the {{youngest}} of four children of Henry Bury and his wife Mary Jane (née Henley). He was orphaned in infancy. His father, who worked for a local fishmonger called Joscelyne, died in a horse and cart accident in Halesowen on 10 April 1860. While on an incline, he fell beneath the wheels of his fish <b>cart</b> <b>and</b> was killed when the horse bolted and pulled the cart over his prone body. William's mother may have been suffering from post-natal depression {{at the time of}} her husband's death and was committed to the Worcester County Pauper and Lunatic Asylum on 7 May 1860 suffering from melancholia. She remained there until her death aged 33 on 30 March 1864.|$|E

Vasser set the race's fastest lap during the 210th (and penultimate) lap, competing a circuit of 25.217 seconds. Franchitti maintained the lead for the remainder of the race and crossed the start-finish line after 211 laps to win the race. Da Matta was second, ahead of Carpentier in third, Servià was fourth and Junqueira fifth. Takagi, Vasser, Bräck, Manning, and Andretti rounded out the top ten finishers. Jourdain, Dixon, and Domínguez were the last of the classified finishers.

There were nine lead changes in the race; four drivers reached the front of the field. Bräck's total of 134 laps led was the highest of any competitor.
