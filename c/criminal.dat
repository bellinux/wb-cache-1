5|$|During Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court had no general appellate {{jurisdiction}} in <b>criminal</b> cases. The Court could review <b>criminal</b> convictions {{from the state}} courts, but not the lower federal courts, via writs of error. It only did so twice.

40|$|White-collar <b>criminals</b> {{are persons}} of respectability and high social status, who commit {{financial}} {{crime in the}} course of their occupation. In a national sample of 305 convicted <b>criminals,</b> the average age was 48 years old, and the average sentence was 2. 2 years in prison. White-collar crime lawyers defend <b>criminals</b> in court. The case of Transocean is presented in this article, where the company and their prosecuted advisors will probably spend about $ 10 million on lawyers in the first round in a district court. This emphasizes a distinguishing feature of white-collar <b>criminals</b> from street <b>criminals,</b> where white-collar <b>criminals</b> can pay for a knowledgeable defense. Some <b>criminals</b> nay have quite famous lawyers, who are well-known for getting their probably guilty clients off. A knowledge level perspective is applied in this paper, where the relative knowledge between defense and prosecution has an influence on how the case is handled and possibly even on the court verdict...|$|R

5|$|New Jersey {{is one of}} {{only two}} states (along with Wisconsin) that {{classify}} DUI as a traffic violation, and not a <b>criminal</b> offense, except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is not a <b>criminal</b> offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do {{not have the right to}} a jury trial, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC <b>criminal</b> database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory <b>criminal</b> defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law <b>criminal</b> defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity.|$|E
