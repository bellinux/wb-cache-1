On the pavements of the commercial area there are sometimes signboards, goods being pushed about, parked bicycles, motorcycles, and cars parked which further narrows the pavements. Even out of the commercial area, there are cars parked on the pavements. The pedestrian bridges in the investigated area nearly fit Fukuoka's prefectural bylaws.

40|$|Abstract: Pavement {{deterioration}} rate is {{very difficult}} to predict because of the complexities in determining the pavement condition rating or difficulty in collecting detailed data, particularly in absence of sophisticated equipment or trained staff etc. A wide variety <b>of</b> <b>Pavement</b> Maintenance Systems (PMS) are used, but unfortunately either these systems do not use a formalized procedure to determine the pavement condition rating or they assign the pavement state transition probabilities on the basis of experience. The object {{of this paper is to}} apply the Markovian probability process of operational research to develop a decision support system (DSS) to predict the future <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pavement.</b> Significance <b>of</b> the collected sample data <b>of</b> 20 <b>pavement</b> sections is first tested for Markovian properties.

40|$|Pavement markings, {{as a form}} {{of traffic}} control devices, {{play a crucial role in}} safely guiding drivers. Restriping {{pavement}} markings is an important task in the maintenance of traffic control devices. Every year state agencies spend a lot of money in maintaining pavement markings as the retroreflectivity or durability values of the markings fall below a minimum level. Currently, the most widely adopted method used to determine the presence <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> markings is by expert observation, a subjective technique that may not provide consistent and convinced results for agencies. Hence, a fast and accurate way to determine the presence <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> markings can lead to significant cost savings while ensuring driving safety. In this study, a systematic approach that can automatically determine the presence <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> markings using digital image processing techniques is presented. These techniques are used to correct the geometric deformity, detect colors <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> markings, segment images, enhance images, detect edge lines <b>of</b> ideal <b>pavement</b> markings, and recognize the features <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> markings appearing in the photographs. To better implement the aforementioned techniques, a software package has been developed by Graphic User Interface (GUI) as a platform to simultaneously evaluate the presence <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> single or multiple pavement markings. The developed software package is able to do operations such as open files, calibrate camera calibration, clip, rotation, histogram display, and detection of edge lines <b>of</b> ideal <b>pavement</b> markings. The above system was tested and evaluated with the photograph datasets provided by the NTPEP Mississippi test deck. The empirical results (when compared with the manual method and expert observation) show that the developed system in this study is accurate and reliable. Additionally, the interactivity of the developed software package is satisfactory due to the feedback from ten volunteers. It is also concluded that the developed system, as an important reference, potentially helps agencies make a better decision in the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> markings with more accurate and speedy evaluation <b>of</b> the presence <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> markings...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFalling weight {{deflectometer}} (FWD) {{testing has}} been used to evaluate structural <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavements</b> to predict the layer moduli using backcalculation process. However, the predicted pavement layer moduli sometimes may not be accurate even if computed and measured deflection basin has fulfilled the standard and is in concurrence with certain tolerable limits. The characteristics of pavement structure, including pavement layer thickness condition and temperature variation, affect the predicted pavement structural capacity and back calculated layer modulus. The main objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the FWD test results of flexible pavement in Western Australia to predict the pavement structural capacity. Collected data includes, in addition to FWD measurements, core data and pavement distress surveys. Results showed that the dynamic analysis of falling weight deflectometer test and prediction for the strength of character of flexible pavement layer moduli have been achieved, and algorithms for interpretation of the deflection basin have been improved. The variations of moduli of all layers along the length of sections for majority of the projects are accurate and consistent with measured and computed prediction. However, some of the projects had some inconsistent with modulus values along the length of the sections. Results are reasonable but consideration should be taken to fix varied pavement layers moduli sections...|$|E
40|$|Several in-place {{rehabilitation}} {{techniques have}} been used before placing an Asphalt Concrete (AC) overlay on Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) pavements in attempts to minimize reflection cracking. Among these techniques, 2 ̆ 2 rubblization 2 ̆ 2 of PCC has been recognized {{to be the most}} utilized procedure for the mitigation of reflection cracking in US. This paper presents the practices on the use of rubblization in US and discusses the performance of this technique based on field evaluation. The specifications for the rubblization procedure used by state Department of Transportation (DOT) in US were reviewed. To evaluate the performance of rubblization technique, the structural and the surface conditions of AC overlaid pavements with rubblized PCC layer are compared to those with virgin PCC layer. A series of field experiment tests were carried out on six representative AC overlaid pavements with both rubblized PCC and virgin PCC in Iowa during 2007. The field experiment tests include the Nondestructive (NDT) and destructive tests, and the distress survey.

40|$|All {{kinds of}} {{motorways}} enable motor vehicles to travel. Pavement structures and pavement surfaces {{are exposed to}} various loadings (traffic, climate etc.) which cause deformations and deterioration (changes of condition). Pavement deteriorations effect the driving quality and user costs. Therefore Pavement Management Systems (PMS) are applied. PMS is an activity where the administrator with optimal financial investments maintains an appropriate <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavements.</b> The appropriate condition is a condition of pavement, which enables the users safe, comfortable and economical driving.

It was chosen by an independent company DDC Consulting & Engineering Ltd, who is developing the expert system named PMS-DARS. On the basis of pavement characteristic data and pavement deterioration models PMS-DARS generates several maintenance strategies for the analysis period (15 years). Each strategy represents particular costs to the administrator and benefits for users.

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough University. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) technology has existed for many decades, but it has only {{been in the last}} 20 to 30 years that it has undergone great development for use in near surface ground investigations. The early 1980 ’s saw the first major developments in the application of GPR for pavements (i. e. engineered structures designed to carry traffic loads), and it is now an established investigation technique, with generic information included in several national standard guidance documents. Analysis of GPR data can provide information on layer depths, material condition, moisture, voiding, reinforcement and location of other features. Assessing the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavements,</b> in order to plan subsequent maintenance, is essential to allow the efficient long-term functioning of the structure and GPR has enhanced and improved the range and certainty of information that can be obtained from pavement investigations. Despite the recent establishment of the technique in pavement investigation, the current situation is one in which GPR is used routinely for pavement projects in only a minority of countries, and the specialist nature of the technique and the sometimes variable results that are obtained can mean that there is both a lack of appreciation and a lack of awareness of the potential information that GPR can provide. The fact that GPR is still a developing technique, and that many aspects of its use are specialised in their nature, means that there are also several technical aspects of GPR pavement investigations which have not been fully researched, and knowledge of the response of GPR to some material conditions has not been fully established. The overall aim of this EngD research project was to provide improved pavement investigation capabilities by enhancing the methodologies and procedures used to obtain information from GPR. Several discrete research topics were addressed through various research methods including a literature review, fieldwork investigations, experimental laboratory investigations and a review of previously collected data. The findings of the research allowed conclusions and recommendations to be made regarding improved fieldwork methodologies, enhancing information and determining material condition from previously collected GPR data, assessing the effect of pavement temperature and moisture condition on GPR data and also on managing errors and uncertainty in GPR data. During the EngD project, a number of documents and presentations have been made to publicise the findings both within the EngD sponsoring company (Jacobs) and externally, and an in-house GPR capability has been established within Jacobs {{as a direct result of}} the EngD project...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{critical}} issue concerning {{the deterioration of}} ageing road infrastructure {{all around the world}} is the need to rapidly and cost-effectively evaluate the present <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> infrastructure. Non-Destructive Test (NDT) and evaluation methods are well-suited for characterizing materials and determining structural integrity <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> systems. The Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) is a Nondestructive Test (NDT) equipment used to assess the structural <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> airfield <b>pavement</b> systems and to determine the moduli <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> layers which are not only good condition indicators, but are also necessary inputs for conducting mechanistic based pavement structural analysis.

40|$|Although {{possessing}} remarkable toughness in {{its original}} state, asphalt concrete (AC) becomes brittle and prone to damage with time {{in the form of}} costly pavement cracking. The time required to reach an unacceptable level of embrittlement depends upon a number of factors and varies widely from pavement to pavement, even within a given region and mixture type. Given the annual costs associated with pavement repair of damage caused by mechanical and thermal loads, considerable interest exists in testing methods to estimate damage in AC pavements. Current methods to evaluate the existing conditions of AC pavement surfaces for sustainability-based pavement asset management are based upon the binder’s rheological properties, are time consuming, costly, and by themselves, may cause additional damage. Oxidative aging is a key contributor in the deterioration of AC pavements. Exposure to environmental conditions causes gradual oxidative aging of the AC, where the highest aged material is located at the surface, whereas the material {{at the bottom of the}} pavement is significantly less aged. Over time, increasing aging at the surface leads to a pavement with graded material properties through its thickness where the material near the surface has warmer embrittlement temperatures and higher stiffness when compared with the bottom of the layer. Increasing aging also results in significant loss of adhesion between the binder, aggregates, and fines, which contributes to an increase in the microflaw population in the mastic and at the interfaces between the mastic and the aggregates. As the pavement is subjected to thermal and mechanical loads, microcracks develop and coalesce to form larger cracks. Repeated loading and exposure to environmental conditions eventually leads to significant deterioration of AC pavements. Although surveys are conducted to monitor the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavements</b> and to determine when preventative or corrective maintenance is necessary, accurate assessment of the amount of pavement deterioration has remained a challenge. A study to assess oxidative aging of AC using noncollinear wave mixing of two dilatational waves will be presented. Criteria are used to assure that the detected scattered wave originated via wave interaction in the AC and not from nonlinearities in the testing equipment. These criteria include frequency and propagating direction of the resultant scattered wave, and the time-of-flight separation between the two primary waves and the resulting scattered wave. It was observed that AC exhibits nonlinear behavior. It was also observed that the nonlinear response decreases with increased aging until ~ 24 hours of aging after which the nonlinear response exponentially increases. This observation is consistent with earlier studies including acoustic emission response to thermal loading, and with changes in dynamic modulus and fracture energy with increasing aging...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Civil EngineeringMustaque A. HossainRemaining {{service life}} (RSL) {{has been defined}} as the {{anticipated}} number of years that a pavement will be functionally and structurally acceptable with only routine maintenance. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) has a comprehensive pavement management system, network optimization system (NOS), which uses the RSL concept. In support of NOS, annual condition surveys are conducted on the state highway system. Currently KDOT uses an empirical equation to compute RSL of flexible pavements based on surface condition and deflection from the last sensor of a falling-weight deflectometer (FWD). Due to limited resources and large size, annual network-level structural data collection {{at the same rate as}} the project level is impractical. A rolling-wheel deflectometer (RWD), which measures surface deflections at highway speed, is an alternate and fast method of pavement-deflection testing for network-level data collection. Thus, a model that can calculate RSL in terms of FWD first sensor/center deflection (the only deflection measured by RWD) is desired for NOS. In this study, RWD deflection data was collected under an 18 -kip axle load at highway speed on non-Interstate highways in northeast Kansas in July 2006. FWD deflection data, collected with a Dynatest 8000 FWD on the KDOT network from 1998 to 2006, were reduced to mile-long data to match the condition survey data collected annually for NOS. Normalized and temperature-corrected FWD and RWD center deflections and corresponding effective structural numbers (SNeff) were compared. A nonlinear regression procedure in Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) and Solver in Microsoft Excel were used to develop the models in this study. Results showed that FWD and RWD center deflections and corresponding SNeff are statistically similar. Temperature-correction factors have significant influence on these variables. FWD data analysis on the study sections showed that average structural <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavements</b> of the KDOT non-Interstate network did not change significantly over the last four years. Thus, network-level deflection data can be collected at four-year intervals when there is no major structural improvement. Results also showed that sigmoimal relationship exists between RSL and center deflection. Sigmoidal RSL models have very good fits and can be used to predict RSL based on center deflection from FWD or RWD. Sigmoidal equivalent fatigue crack-models have also shown good fits, but with some scatter that can be attributed to the nature and quality of the data used to develop these models. Predicted and observed equivalent transverse-crack values do not match very well, though the difference in magnitude is insignificant for all practical purposes...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. The remoteness of the Pacific Island Countries (PICs), similar to parts of Africa, creates difficulties, both logistically and economically, to undertake detailed in-country investigations on the road networks. Therefore, rapid assessments of {{the condition of the}} existing road pavements are required to determine the level of required donor investments to maintain the integrity of the road network. This paper explores the use of Roadroid, a simple android application, as a low cost solution to evaluating road roughness in the Pacific region. The case study presented in this paper demonstrates the use of the Roadroid application on the road network in Kiribati, one of the smaller and debatably the most remote PIC. The results from the study discuss the performance and practicability of the android application, primarily as an Information Quality Level- 3 / 4 information device, in the Pacific region. The results from the field surveys supported the delivery of an Information Quality Level- 3 / 4 device. The large variation reported in the surveys between the International Roughness Index collected was attributed to the small sampling intervals embedded in the device. Post-processing of the data, which averaged the unfiltered data across one kilometre sub-sections along the main road in South Tarawa, reduced the variability reported across the road network and provided results consistent with what experienced evaluators expected. Field surveys were conducted with the smartphone device and the data was analysed post survey. However, the statistical reliability of the device was less satisfactory when the roughness measurements were compared across various speeds. However, within the accuracy limits of an Information Quality Level- 3 / 4 device, considered to be ± 20 % of the International Roughness Index, the equipment more than satisfied the need. Roadroid can assist the asset management of road networks by offering a low-cost solution to monitoring and reporting on the roughness <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavements</b> in the Pacific region, as well as in other developing regions. Although this paper reports on the performance of the device, further comparison is recommended to confirm the reported International Roughness Index values accurately reflect the condition of the road pavement. To do so, it is recommended to comparatively study the results from the Roadroid android application with those from specialized instrumented vehicles, such as a laser profilometer.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour of pavements in cold regions can considerably {{be affected}} by seasonal variation in environmental factors such as temperature and moisture content. Along with the destructive effect of heavy traffic loads, climatic and environmental factors can considerably contribute to pavement deterioration. These factors can influence the structural and functional capacity of the pavement structures which, as a result, can trigger and accelerate pavement deterioration mechanisms. Studies {{on the influence of}} variation of the environmental factors on the response and behaviour of pavement materials have shown that proper consideration to these factors must be given in realistic pavement design and analysis. In flexible pavement structures, particularly with a thin hot mix asphalt (HMA) layer, unbound materials and subgrade soil largely contribute to the overall structural behaviour of the pavement system. In unbound materials, moisture content and its variation can significantly affect pavement layer stiffness and permanent deformation characteristics. Therefore, the moisture <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavements</b> and its influence on the mechanical behaviour of pavement materials has been of interest among the pavement research community. A proper understanding of moisture transformation in pavement systems and its effects on pavement performance are important for mechanistic pavement design. The present summary of this doctoral thesis is based on four main parts. The first part of the thesis covers field measurements and findings from a test section along county road 126 in southern Sweden and consists of two journal papers (paper I and II) tackling different aspects of the research topic. This test section is located in a relatively wet ground condition and consists of a thin flexible pavement structure with a deep drainage system. It is instrumented with subsurface temperature, volumetric moisture content and groundwater probes. The mechanical response of the pavement structure was investigated using Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) measurements. The second part of the thesis (paper III and IV) are based on laboratory experiments and investigates different recent approaches that have been proposed to apply principles of unsaturated soil mechanics for incorporating seasonal variation of moisture content into the resilient modulus models using matric suction. The third part of the thesis (paper V) builds a bridge that spans between the laboratory and field investigations with an attempt to evaluate one of the predictive models presented in Paper III. The fourth part of the thesis (paper VI) mainly focuses on the laboratory-based investigation of the permanent deformation characteristic of subgrade soils. In this part, the permanent deformation characteristics of two different silty sand subgrade soils were investigated and modelled using the data obtained from repeated load traxial tests. Paper I mainly focuses on the spring-thaw weakening of the pavement structure. The environmental data collected using different sensors and the FWD tests were used to investigate variations in moisture content with thaw penetration and its influence on the stiffness of unbound layers and the pavement’s overall bearing capacity. Using the backcalculated layer stiffness and corresponding in situ moisture measurements in the unbound layers, a degree of saturation-based moisture-stiffness model was developed for the granular material and the subgrade. In Paper II, the drainage system of the structure was manually clogged during a three month period in summer to raise the groundwater level and increase the moisture content of the layers. Along with the subsurface groundwater level and moisture content monitoring, the structural response of the pavement was studied. In this research work, the FWD tests were conducted at three different load levels. The stress dependent behaviour of the unbound granular layer and the subgrade soil were further studied using the multilevel loads FWD test data. Additionally, parameters of a nonlinear stress-dependent stiffness model were backcalculated and their sensitivity to in situ moisture content was studied. In Paper III and IV, series of suction-controlled repeated load triaxial (RLT) tests were conducted on two silty sand (SM) subgrade materials. Several resilient modulus prediction models that account for seasonal moisture content variation through matric suction were summarized and after optimizing the model parameters, the capability of the prediction models in capturing the material response were evaluated. In Paper V, an attempt was made to evaluate the proficiency of one of the suction-resilient modulus models using the field moisture content and FWD measurements from the Torpsbruk test site. The backcalculated subgrade stiffness dataset at different moisture contents were compared with resilient modulus models obtained from the suction-resilient modulus predictive model. Paper VI presents an evaluation of several permanent deformation models for unbound pavement materials that incorporate the time-hardening concept using a series of multistage repeated load triaxial (RLT) tests conducted on silty sand subgrade materials. The permanent deformation tests were conducted at four different moisture contents with pore suctions measurement throughout the test. The effect of moisture content (matric suction) on the permanent deformation characteristics of the materials and the predictive model parameters were further investigated. QC 20150324 </p...|$|E

40|$|Pavement {{deterioration}} {{models are}} important inputs for the pavement management systems (PMS). These models {{are based on}} the study of performance data. These models {{are based on the}} study of performance data, and they provide the evolution law <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> deterioration. Performance data consist of observations <b>of</b> the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> sections, and are collected through several follow-up campaigns on road networks. In order to characterize the pavement deterioration process, several statistical methods have been developed at the LCPC (French Public Works Research Laboratory). However, these methods are suboptimal for modelling the evolution <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> deterioration, as they ignore unitspecific random effects and potential correlation among repeated measurements. This paper presents a nonlinear mixed-effects model allowing to account for the correlation between observations on the same pavement section. Based on this nonlinear mixed-effects modelling, we investigate and identify structural and climatic factors that explain differences in the parameters between pavement sections, and quantify the impact of these factors on pavement evolution. The proposed model provides a good fit for describing the evolution law <b>of</b> different <b>pavement</b> sections. The performance of this model is assessed via simulated and real data...|$|R
40|$|The {{load-bearing}} capacity <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> structures {{is a fundamental}} structural performance metric of transportation infrastructure networks {{in the context of}} safe and efficient movement of people and goods from one place to another. Non-destructive test (NDT) methods are typically employed to routinely evaluate the structural <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>pavement</b> structures, their lifespan and the appropriate maintenance activities to be carried out. This involves computing the Young’s modulus of each layer <b>of</b> the <b>pavement</b> structure through inverse analysis of acquired NDT data. Over the past two decades, soft computing techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Genetic Algorithms (GAs), and Fuzzy Logic Approach (FLA) have been applied in numerous civil engineering fields for pattern recognition, function approximation, etc. This paper proposes the use of an Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) combined with Finite Element Modeling (FEM) for inverse analysis <b>of</b> multi-layered flexible <b>pavement</b> structures subjected to dynamic loading.
