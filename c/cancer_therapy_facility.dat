40|$|A compact proton {{synchrotron}} using combined function magnets is proposed to help realize the wider availability of charged particle <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy</b> <b>facilities.</b> This combined function magnet was designed {{with the help}} of three-dimensional magnetic field calculations to take account of a realistic fringe and the interference among the magnetic poles. An evaluation scheme for tune values based on particle tracking was developed to improve the magnet design. To verify the magnet design, a model magnet was fabricated and measured. In order to achieve a tune value evaluation from the measured magnetic field, schemes for accurate field mapping and field interpolation were developed. From the tune value evaluation of the measured magnetic field, it was thought that the performance of the model magnet was good enough to construct a synchrotron. In this paper, we report details of the design and the evaluation scheme for the combined function magnet and the results of the field measurements of the model magnet...|$|R
40|$|A laser {{ion source}} based on Nd:YAG laser has been being {{studied at the}} Institute of Modern Physics for the {{production}} of high intensity high charge state heavy ion beams in the past ten years, for possible applications both in a future accelerator complex and in heavy ion <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy</b> <b>facilities.</b> Based on the previous results {{for the production of}} multiple-charged ions {{from a wide range of}} heavy elements with a 3 J/ 8 ns Nd: YAG laser [Zhao et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 85, 02 B 910 (2014) ], higher laser energy and intensity in the focal spot are necessary for the production of highly charged ions from the elements heavier than aluminum. Therefore, the laser ion source was upgraded with a new Nd: YAG laser, the maximum energy of which is 8 J and the pulse duration can be adjusted from 8 to 18 ns. Since then, the charge state distributions of ions from various elements generated by the 8 J Nd: YAG laser were investigated for different experimental conditions, such as laser energy, pulse duration, power density in the focal spot, and incidence angle. It was shown that the incidence angle is one of the most important parameters for the production of highly charged ions. The capability of producing highly charged ions from the elements lighter than silver was demonstrated with the incidence angle of 10 degrees and laser power density of 8 x 10 (13) W cm(- 2) in the focal spot, which makes a laser ion source complementary to the superconducting electron cyclotron resonance ion source for the future accelerator complex especially in terms of the ion beam production from some refractory elements. Nevertheless, great efforts with regard to the extraction of intense ion beams, modification of the ion beam pulse duration, and reliability of the ion source still need to be made for practical applications.

40|$|High-intensity laser plasma-based ion accelerators provide {{unsurpassed}} field gradients in the megavolt-per-micrometer range. They represent promising {{candidates for}} next-generation {{applications such as}} ion beam <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy</b> in compact <b>facilities.</b> The weak scaling of maximum ion energies with the square-root of the laser intensity, established for large sub-picosecond class laser systems, motivates the search for more efficient acceleration processes. Here we demonstrate that for ultrashort (pulse duration ~ 30 fs) highly relativistic (intensity ~ 1021 W cm − 2) laser pulses, the intra-pulse phase of the proton acceleration process becomes relevant, yielding maximum energies of around 20 meV. Prominent non-target-normal emission of energetic protons, reflecting an engineered asymmetry in the field distribution of promptly accelerated electrons, is used to identify this pre-thermal phase of the acceleration. The relevant timescale reveals the underlying physics leading to the near-linear intensity scaling observed for 100 TW class table-top laser systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the {{additional}} neutron effective dose during passive scattering proton therapy. Monte Carlo code (Monte Carlo N-Particle 6) simulation was conducted based on a precise modeling of the National <b>Cancer</b> Center's proton <b>therapy</b> <b>facility.</b> A three-dimensional neutron effective dose profile of the interior of the treatment room was acquired via a computer simulation of the 217. 8 -MeV proton beam. Measurements were taken with a 3 He neutron detector to support the simulation results, which were lower than the simulation results by 16 % on average. The secondary photon dose was about 0. 8 % of the neutron dose. The dominant neutron source was deduced based on flux calculation. The secondary neutron effective dose per proton absorbed dose ranged from 4. 942  ±  0. 031  mSv/Gy at the end of the field to 0. 324  ±  0. 006  mSv/Gy at 150  cm in axial distance...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} aspect {{to be considered}} when designing the GSI future project will be the radiation protection of both the staff and the environment. One of the prerequisites for a permission for the operation of a high-energy accelerator is a careful planning of the necessary radiation shielding equipment. In order to give recommendations {{for the amount of}} concrete needed for adequate radiation shielding one has to calculate the transport of the primary produced radiation through the shielding walls. Here we report on using the radiation transport code FLUKA [1] for the evaluation of the shielding design of a medical radiation treatment unit [2]. As an example the irradiation room of the planned heavy-ion <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy</b> <b>facility</b> in Heidelberg is subject to an radiation protection analysis. Neutrons of a wide energy range mainly constitute the radiation impact behind the shielding walls. The production of neutrons by a 400 MeV/u carbon beam in tissue-equivalent material has been measured at the HI-MAC in Chiba [3]. Using the computer program FLUKA these primary neutrons are further transported through the shielding geometry by Monte-Carlo techniques. For comparison a conventional line-of-sight model is applied, too. The shielding equipment of the treatment rooms in Heidelberg will consist of two main components, one solid iron block placed directly behind the patient and a thick wall made of concrete surrounding the room. The geometrical arrangement of the design is illustrated in figure 1. Figure 1 : Principle geometry of the irradiation setup in the planned cancer treatment unit. Carbon ions are absorbed in the tissue. The resulting secondary radiation is absorbed by a solid iron beam catcher and a thick concrete wall subsequently. A second wall may cause back-scattering of neutrons. tissue neutron radiation beam catcher dose rat...|$|E

Recently, the number of judo therapists has been rapidly increasing {{as a result of}} proliferation judo therapy academies.

Methods The number of judo <b>therapy</b> <b>facilities</b> and the population in each municipality were obtained from the Web yellow pages and from Japanese census data for 2004, 2006, and 2008, respectively.
