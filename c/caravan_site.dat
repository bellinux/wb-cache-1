5|$|Bamber and Mugford {{had started}} dating in 1983, {{when she was}} 19 and {{studying}} for a degree in education at Goldsmith's College in London. She had taken a holiday job in Sloppy Joe's, a pizzeria in Colchester, where Jeremy had a bar job in the evenings. Mugford admitted to a brief background of dishonesty. She had been cautioned in 1985 for using a friend's chequebook to obtain goods worth around £700, after it had been reported stolen; she said she and the friend had repaid {{the money to the}} bank. She also acknowledged having helped Bamber, in March or April 1985, steal just under £1,000 from the office of the Osea Road <b>caravan</b> <b>site</b> his family owned; she said he had staged a break-in to make it appear that strangers were responsible.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{launched}} two legal actions {{while in}} prison {{to secure a}} share of the estate, which the cousins said was part of an attempt to harass and vilify them. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover £1.2m from the estate of his adoptive grandmother, arguing that he should have inherited her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, Essex, which went instead to June's sister—the grandmother had cut Bamber out of her will when he was arrested—and that he was owed 17 years' rent from his cousins who lived there. In 2004 he went to the High Court again to claim a £326,000 share of the profit from the <b>caravan</b> <b>site.</b> The court ruled against him.|$|E
5|$|The Bambers were financially secure. There was the farmhouse, {{property}} in London, 300 {{acres of land}} and a <b>caravan</b> <b>site.</b> Their company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth ₤400,000 (c.£1,057,000). In her will June left ₤230,000 (c.£608,000 in 2016), and Nevill left ₤380,000 (c.£1,004,000); Bamber was a major beneficiary of both wills. The couple gave the children a good home and private education, but June was intensely religious and tried to force her children and grandchildren to adopt the same ideas. She had a poor relationship with Sheila, who felt June disapproved of her, and June's relationship with Jeremy was so troubled that he had apparently stopped speaking to her. Sheila's ex-husband {{was concerned about the}} effect June was having on his sons. She made them kneel and pray with her, which upset him and the boys.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Mugford's {{statement}} Bamber was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released. Bamber told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he said {{the only reason he}} had broken into the <b>caravan</b> <b>site</b> with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. He said he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs windows, and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also said he had seen his parents' wills, and that they had left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila. As for the rifle, he told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case.|$|E

25|$|He {{returned}} to the UK to work in restaurants and bars, which included working as a waiter in a Little Chef on the A12, but later agreed to return home and work on his father's farm. Although he reportedly resented the low wages, {{he was given a}} car and lived rent-free in a cottage his father owned at 9 Head Street, Goldhanger, 3½ miles from his family's farmhouse at White House Farm. He also owned eight percent of his family's <b>caravan</b> <b>site,</b> Osea Road Camp Sites Ltd., in Maldon, Essex.|$|E

25|$|Bamber {{launched}} two unsuccessful lawsuits {{while in}} prison to recover {{a share of}} his family's estate. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover £1.2m from the estate of his adoptive grandmother, arguing {{that he should have}} inherited her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, Essex, and that he was owed 17 years' back rent from his cousins who were living there. The grandmother had cut Bamber out of her will when he was arrested, and most of the inheritance went to June Bamber's sister. In 2004 Bamber went to the High Court again to claim a share of the profits from the Bambers' <b>caravan</b> <b>site</b> in Maldon. He had retained his shares after his conviction, but had sold them to pay the legal costs arising from his claim on his grandmother's estate. The court ruled that he was not entitled to any profit from the site because of his conviction.|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} to England {{to work on}} his adoptive parents' farm for £170 a week, and set up home rent-free in a cottage Nevill owned at 9 Head Street Goldhanger (...) [...] The cottage lay 3–3.5 miles (5.6km) from the farmhouse (...) , a five-minute drive by car and at least 15 minutes by bicycle. His father also gave him a car to use, and Jeremy owned eight percent of a family company, Osea Road Camp Sites Ltd, which ran a <b>caravan</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Caravan</b> <b>Sites</b> Act 1968 {{required}} {{local authorities}} to provide <b>caravan</b> <b>sites</b> for travellers {{if there was}} a demonstrated need. This was resisted by many councils who would claim that there were no Romanies living in their areas. The result was that insufficient pitches were provided for travellers, leading to a situation whereby holders of a pitch could no longer travel, for fear of losing it.|$|R

500|$|Because of Bamber's conviction, {{the estate}} passed {{instead to the}} cousins. One moved into White House Farm, while that cousin and several others {{acquired}} full ownership of the <b>caravan</b> <b>site</b> and other buildings. This conflict of interest became a bone of contention, as did the apparent failure of the police to search and secure the crime scene. Bamber argues that the family set him up, a claim {{that one of the}} group dismissed in 2010 as [...] "an absolute load of piffle".|$|E
500|$|While waiting outside, {{the police}} {{questioned}} Bamber, who they said seemed calm. According to the Court of Appeal, {{he told them}} about the phone call from his father, and that it sounded as though someone had cut off the call. He said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was {{the sort of person who}} might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road <b>caravan</b> <b>site</b> [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E
500|$|The {{service sector}} is the {{principal}} economy of Poole; {{a large number of}} employees work for the service economy of local residents or for the tourist economy. During the 1970s, Poole's less restrictive regional planning policies attracted businesses wishing to relocate from London. These included employers in the banking and financial sector, such as Barclays Bank (who operate a regional headquarters in Poole), American Express Bank and the corporate trust division of Bank of New York Mellon. Other important service sector employers include the national headquarters and college of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), the UK headquarters of Fitness First, Bournemouth University and Arts University Bournemouth. Poole is also the headquarters for clothing company Animal, cosmetics manufacturer, Lush, and Merlin Entertainments, the world's second-largest theme park operator after Disney. The Dolphin Shopping Centre is Poole's main retail area, and the largest indoor shopping centre in Dorset. It opened in 1969 as an Arndale Centre, and underwent three major refurbishments in 1980, 1989 and 2004. The centre provides [...] of retail space with 110 stores and two multi-storey car parks with 1,400 parking spaces. A pedestrianised high street containing shops, bars, public houses and restaurants connects the Dolphin Centre with the historic Old Town area and Poole Quay. Tourism is important to the Poole's economy and was worth an estimated £158 million in 2002. Poole's Harbour, Quay, Poole Pottery and the beaches are some of the main attractions for visitors. Visitor accommodation consists of hotels, guest houses and bed and breakfast rooms located around the town, particularly in Sandbanks and the town centre.
