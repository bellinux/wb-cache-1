Sadomasochistic desires, however, seem to form at a variety of ages. Some individuals report having had them before puberty, while others do not discover them until well into adulthood. According to one study, the majority of male sadomasochists (53%) developed their interest before the age of 15, while the majority of females (78%) developed their interest afterwards (Breslow, Evans, and Langley 1985). The prevalence of sadomasochism within the general population is unknown. Despite female sadists being less visible than males, some surveys have resulted in comparable amounts of sadistic fantasies between females and males. The results of such studies demonstrate that one's sex does not determine preference for sadism.|$|E

If it's not, I'm not seeing that as a problem. But assuming that it did, what I would wonder about is what is his or her biology that would cause a tendency toward a problem, and dynamically, what were the experiences this individual had that led him or her toward one of the ends of the spectrum.

40|$|Heavy metals {{are usually}} found in low {{concentrations}} in natural aquatic ecosystem. In recent times, however, {{the occurrence of}} metal contaminants especially heavy metals in excess of natural loads has become a problem of increasing concern. The contributing factors are rapid growth of population, increased urbanization and expansion of industrial activities, exploration and exploitation of natural resources, extension of irrigation and other modern agricultural practices as well as lack of environmental regulations.

Model wastewater solution containing a known concentration of the given heavy metal ions was prepared for both single and mixed at a fixed pH of 5. A 0. 25 g mass of dry algae was introduced for every 100 mL solution. Change in level of concentration was monitored at intervals of 10 minutes using AAS until the rate of biosorption was almost constant. The sorption process occurred in two stages; first being rapid adsorption and then gradual adsorption that was almost constant. Pb was most biosorbed while Zn was least for both systems...|$|E

40|$|New {{advanced}} phase {{field model}} of transformations between martensitic variants and multiple twinning within martensitic variants is developed for large strains and lattice rotations. It resolves numerous existing problems. The model, which involves just one order parameter for {{the description of}} each variant-variant transformation and multiple twinnings within each martensitic variant, provides a well-controlled description of variant-variant transformations and multiple twinning, including expressions for interface tension which {{are consistent with the}} sharp interface limit. The finite element approach is developed and applied to the solution of a number of examples of twinning and combined austenite-martensite and martensite-martensite phase transformations (PTs) and nanostructure evolution.

Thermodynamic Ginzburg-Landau potential for temperature and stress-induced phase transformations (PTs) between n- phases is developed.

40|$|In Victorian-era English Canada John Ruskin's {{ideas were}} perhaps as {{well-known}} {{as they were}} in Britain. However, without the <b>controlling</b> <b>presence</b> of Ruskin, admirers were free to select and re-interpret his positions without fear of reproach, and {{in such a way that}} their projects would be given added credibility by association. The individuals who did this believed that their interpretation and understanding of Ruskin's writings was valid, and often those views, rather than Ruskin's were re-interpreted and expressed. He was not the agent of his influence, but was instead a source to be referred to as needed. Certainly this was not a universal circumstance in Canada, but occurred frequently enough to be significant. Beginning with an examination of the problems of defining the term "influence", the nature of Ruskin's influence in Canada from the mid-nineteenth century through the first decades of the twentieth century is presented. The influence of Ruskin's writings is analysed through a discussion of examples from the following fields: commercial, institutional, and public architecture; art education and training in Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia; and trends in painting. In terms of architecture, Ruskin's ideology was not always taken into account, especially as the north Italian style he championed became more popular. Thus, while the Canadian Houses of Parliament, University College, Toronto, Canadian Institute, and Montreal YMCA may have been relatively true to his principles, the commercial projects of Charles Wilson (Montreal), John Macdonald and Robert Carswell (Toronto) were anything but. The discussion of art education considers how Ruskin's theories were adapted to suit the needs of educators, and then readapted as their interpretations of these theories evolved. Oscar Wilde's 1884 Canadian lectures contained much unacknowledged Ruskin; Fred Brigden, who had studied at the Working Men's College, continued to call himself an art workman after his emigration to Canada; and Arthur Lismer, having been educated in a Sheffield which revered Ruskin, who from early in his career repeated many of the critic's comments and opinions, quoting at length from his writings. The study concludes by examining Ruskin's influence on artists in Canad...|$|E

This coordinated oversight facilitates safety and speed in complex operations where traffic moves in all three dimensions. Air traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided into at least two main areas: ground and tower, though a single controller may work both stations.
