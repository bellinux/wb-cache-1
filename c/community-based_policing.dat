Studies show that the public believes policemen, overall, should work on being more community oriented and accommodating to all of its citizens, not only to reduce tension, anxiety, and stress, but to build trust and satisfaction between both parties. There are current, as well as up-and-coming <b>community-based</b> <b>police</b> programs to give citizens a more [...] "informal", [...] "down to earth", view of their commanding officers.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} {{the recent}} measures {{taken by the}} Municipality of Rio de Janeiro concerning public security {{in the context of}} several international events being organised in the city, including the 2016 Olympic Games. Falling {{within the framework of the}} Federal Programme of Security and Citizenship (Pronasci), these measures aim first and foremost at improving security in several favelas of the city by establishing so-called Pacifying Police Units (UPP). With the study of spatial logics prevailing in the establishment of these units in strategically selected districts, associated with that of the daily practices of residents in several favelas of Rio alongside <b>community-based</b> <b>police</b> forces, we were able to characterise the close link between public security and urban policies. Beyond the displayed objectives of social peace preservation, we examine this link to question the permanence of social difficulties experienced by the majority of favela residents, and to question the underlying land and real estate stakes revealed by these actions. Does the evolution of intervention methods in urban public security, which appears to be closely related to territorial marketing strategies, reflect the unequal and possibly unfair treatment of some of the poorest areas of the city, or does it, on the contrary, lead to considering new means of security provision in areas highly affected by violence, poverty and a lack of public services...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{conflicts}} often {{arise from}} distrust among certain ethnic, religious or militant groups {{who no longer}} believe that the local government and its legal system are able to guarantee and defend their individual and collective rights, their cultural identity and their personal or collective safety. Discrimination, corruption and abuse of power by law enforcement officials or the military, fuel and exacerbate conflicts. Since it is commonly accepted that safeguarding domestic security is a crucial precondition for achieving sustainable peace and the best guarantee against the pernicious consequences of conflicts such as enduring instability, streams of refugees and the prevalence of organized crime, interventions in the post-Cold War era have increasingly put the spotlight on the internal security situation of war-torn societies. Because criminal violence and lawlessness have a disrupting impact on post-intervention societies as a whole, the prevention and control of crime is a vital aspect of procuring that security. This contribution {{provides an overview of}} our current understanding of crime in post-intervention societies and the typical reaction to it (exporting the <b>community-based</b> <b>police</b> model) through a literature study. The objective {{of this paper is to}} highlight where the existing literature falls short, where more research is needed, how and why.

50|$|A {{recent study}} by Amie Schuck (2014) has shown that in general, women {{are less likely to}} {{assimilate}} hypermasculine beliefs into their identities. Women are {{more likely to engage in}} what Schuck refers to as emotional labor, the “management of feelings in an effort to invoke a specific state of mind in another person.” This kind of work might include interacting more empathetically towards citizens, which may explain Schuck’s findings that women police officers are less likely to be subject to negative reports and complaints from citizens. However, Schuck cautions against reading too much into these findings, worrying that focusing on differences in how women and men view policing is a “slippery slope that will result in essentialist thinking and prejudicial and discriminatory practices,” such as relegating women solely to policing jobs that require more emotional labor. Yet she believes that acknowledging these differing perspectives remains important, especially when this acknowledgement might lead to police reform, such as more <b>community-based</b> and empathetic <b>policing.</b>|$|R
40|$|The 1970 s saw a {{shift of}} focus by professions {{responding}} to domestic violence cases perpetrated by men towards women within Australia. Their focus was targeted at the factors that surround male perpetrators? violent behaviour. As a result, a number of alternative interventions were established based on {{a new understanding of}} domestic violence. Wider explanations have therefore led professional groups to form different angles of approach. Consequently researchers have found that perceptions towards domestic violence and the effectiveness of relevant interventions remain controversial across professions (Laing, 2002). Based on the literature supporting the importance of consistent professional perceptions and responses towards domestic violence, the current qualitative research aimed to measure the consistency of perceptions across five Perth professional groups: <b>Police,</b> <b>community-based,</b> women 2 ̆ 7 s refuge, justice and health professionals (N: 39).

40|$|The {{strategies}} and techniques that police officers employ are adaptations to {{the types of}} communities they serve and the law enforcement system {{of which they are}} part. Observations of policing in rural and urban areas of Australia indicate that, despite being part of a single state police service, officers develop working philosophies that are systematically adapted to the locations they serve. Bayley (1989) has observed that while crimes are policed in the city, people are policed in the country. Rural police officers often adopt a <b>community-based</b> model of <b>policing</b> in which officers become integrated into a community and establish compatible community relations. While this model can produce successful results, with integration into informal social networks providing police increased opportunities to solve crime, rural police regularly find themselves occupying competing roles of law enforcer and local resident. This chapter will outline how the organisation and structure of rural communities impacts upon policing, noting distinct issues associated with police work in rural settings. Before examining current aspects of rural policing, a brief discussion of the historical and cultural context of rural policing is provided...|$|R

5000|$|Since the 1980s, {{violent crime}} and gang {{activity}} have plagued the Maryvale community.

40|$|The {{primary concern}} of this thesis {{is to examine}} changes in {{policing}} practice with reference to police/public relations in England and Wales {{in the light of}} evidence of a deterioration of the relationships between the police and the public. The secondary aim is to examine the implications for policing policy in Turkey of the lessons learned from the experience of such experiments and changes in the development of policing policy in England and Wales. The thesis argues that a <b>community-based</b> model of <b>policing</b> is the ideal for policing of modern liberal democratic societies; and community policing practices are transferable to countries striving to develop modern democratic systems such as Turkey. The thesis assesses the prognosis for the achievement of this ideal in both countries. It emphasises that community policing has become the new orthodoxy for the police in England and Wales, as well as in other countries around the world. Although the movement's philosophies and practices are spreading rapidly, much of the debate is carried out at a rhetorical level and {{little is known about the}} range of ongoing activities, the components of these experimental initiatives, the problems and challenges encountered, and the level of success in achieving objectives. There are fundamental differences in the historical development and political position of the police forces in these two countries. However, police services are under pressure from diverse interests and constituencies to change their styles of policing in order to secure legitimate law enforcement in the light of rapid social change. The reasons for this pressure for change will be examined in both countries. Firstly, the British experience will be analysed notably with reference to the historical antecedents which secured a broad legitimacy for a consensual style of policing which it may be argued is in existence despite serious outbreaks of urban disorder. However, the thesis shows that the gulf between the police and some sections of the community is widening, resulting in a substantial proportion (notably of the black population) lacking confidence and trust in the police. Interest has also focused on the apparent failure of some police forces to control crime. Secondly, the history of the current Turkish police tradition is analysed and rationales for change explained with fluctuations in police/public legitimacy traced and accounted for. Pressure for change to enhance police legitimacy and public relations is identified and the possibility of lessons being learned from the British experience assessed, notably with reference to initiatives to present the police as a service to communities. The thesis concludes that, both for England and Wales and Turkey, the success of community policing initiatives is heavily dependent on the commitment and participation of both sides, the police and the community in both countries...|$|R
