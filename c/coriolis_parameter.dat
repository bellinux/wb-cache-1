For the intermediate case, Ostrovsky waves are generated. Their phase speed increases with increasing amplitude. Then, there are two characteristic wave lengths: one which varies with the inverse square root of the amplitude, as for the KdV wave, and the other, linked with the rotation, which varies as the square root of the amplitude.

The fine latitudinal resolution provided by the WMO station network reveals several interesting features in the latitudinal structure of the annual and quasi-biennial cycles which dominate this region. For example, the westerly and easterly acceleration phases of the quasi-biennial oscillation are markedly different. Westerly accelerations appear first at the equator, spreading outward with time to higher latitudes, and are more intense, on average, than the easterly accelerations. The easterly accelerations are more uniform in latitude, but less uniform in time, sometimes occurring in two stages. The quasi-biennial wind and temperature oscillations are symmetric about the equator, while the annual harmonic in zonal wind is antisymmetric about the equator, but is not proportional to the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>parameters.</b> Monthly mean zonal wind and temperature appear to be in thermal wind balance at the equator.

40|$|Fine- and micro-structure {{observations}} {{indicate that}} turbulent mixing is enhanced within O(1) km above rough topography. Enhanced mixing {{is associated with}} internal wave breaking and, in many regions of the ocean, {{has been linked to}} the breaking and dissipation of internal tides. The generation and dissipation of internal tides are explored in this study using a high-resolution two-dimensional nonhydrostatic numerical model, which explicitly resolves the instabilities leading to wave breaking, configured in an idealized domain with a realistic multiscale topography and flow characteristics. The control simulation, chosen to represent the Brazil Basin region, produces a vertical profile of energy dissipation and temporal characteristics of finescale motions that are consistent with observations. Results suggest that a significant fraction of mixing in the bottom O(1) km of the ocean is sustained by the transfer of energy from the large-scale internal tides to smaller-scale internal waves by nonlinear wave–wave interactions. The time scale of the energy transfer to the smaller scales is estimated to be on the order of a few days. A suite of sensitivity experiments is carried out to examine the dependence of the energy transfer time scale and energy dissipation on topographic roughness, tidal amplitude, and <b>Coriolis</b> frequency <b>parameters.</b> Implications for tidal mixing parameterizations are discussed. 1...|$|R
