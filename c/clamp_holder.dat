40|$|The {{stunning}} of ostriches (Struthio camelus) {{has traditionally}} been carried out with hand-held tongs whilst birds are held in a restraining area by applying pressure normally from behind by gently pushing on the tail feathers. The area is often a V-shaped structure, high enough that the stunning operator is not kicked. After stunning, the birds are rocked backwards and a rubberised leg clamp placed over the legs at the tarso-metatarsal bone allowing the birds to be chain-shackled by the big toes. This stunning procedure {{has been replaced by}} a new restraining and stunning mechanism which completely envelops the ostrich in a padded <b>clamp</b> <b>holder.</b> Double-padded sides restrain the bird's upper thighs and a rubberised foot clamp holds the feet so there is no physical damage to the bird. As the bird is electrically stunned with electrodes placed both sides of the head, the entire stunning box rotates 180 ° so that toe clamps can be applied without any danger to the stunning operators. Within 20 s of stunning, the birds are bled by means of a complete ventral cut to the neck and/or by thoracic sticking. © 2012 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare...|$|E

40|$|Background We have {{developed}} a novel head-holding device for behaving non-human primates that affords stability suitable for reliable chronic electrophysiological recording experiments. The device is completely non-invasive, and thus avoids the risk of infection and other complications that can occur {{with the use of}} conventional, surgically implanted head-fixation devices. New method The device consists of a novel non-invasive head mold and bar <b>clamp</b> <b>holder,</b> and is customized to the shape of each monkey's head. The head-holding device that we introduce, combined with our recording system and reflection-based eye-tracking system, allows for chronic behavioral experiments and single-electrode or multi-electrode recording, as well as manipulation of brain activity. Results and comparison with existing methods With electrodes implanted chronically in multiple brain regions, we could record neural activity from cortical and subcortical structures with stability equal to that recorded with conventional head-post fixation. Consistent with the non-invasive nature of the device, we could record neural signals {{for more than two years}} with a single implant. Importantly, the monkeys were able to hold stable eye fixation positions while held by this device, demonstrating the possibility of analyzing eye movement data with only the gentle restraint imposed by the non-invasive head-holding device. Conclusions We show that the head-holding device introduced here can be extended to the head holding of smaller animals, and note that it could readily be adapted for magnetic resonance brain imaging over extended periods of time.

40|$|Background: In Indonesia, the {{incidence}} rate of tooth extraction {{as the main}} form of dental treatment reached as high as 79. 6 % in 2014. Teeth extraction leads to periodontal tissue defect whose treatment, incorporating the use of graft material Hydroxyapatite (HA) and Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) with stem cells, has become increasingly widespread. The stem cell potentially put to therapeutic use is the Hematopoetic Stem Cell (HSC). Aim and Objectives: to {{examine the effect of}} hematopoetic stem cell addition to HA graft and PRF post-tooth extraction on the number of osteoblasts and amount of Osteoprotegerin (OPG) in periodontal defect treatment. Material and Methods: This study constituted laboratory-based experimental research with a post test-only control group. Twenty four rats (Rattus novergicus) represented the animal study model in this research. Alveolar bone defect in the animal study model was induced by extracting the first molar of the mandible using sterile needle <b>holder</b> <b>clamps.</b> The sample population was divided into four groups: K 0 : the untreated control group; K 1 : socket filled with HA Graft and PRF. K 2 : socket filled with HSC 105 cells. K 3 : the socket filled with HA Graft and PRF with HSC 106 cells. Results: The K 3 group had both the highest number of osteoblasts when compared with the control group (350. 17 ± 33. 42; P < 0. 001) and the strongest OPG expression of all treatment groups (11. 36 ± 0. 54; P < 0. 01).

40|$|In this study, the {{rheological}} {{characteristics of}} a titanium alloy have been obtained by multi-dome bulging test. Free bulging process is an experimental technique {{that can be used}} to characterize material in conditions of biaxial tension during superplastic, as well as conventional, hot forming. The constitutive constants are calculated on a base of the information about the bulge geometry, applied pressure, and forming time. A multi-dome forming test allows one to reduce the number of the experiments required for the characterization, since every multi-dome test produces several domes of different size. In this study, a specific die for multi-dome test was used. The die has six holes with different radiuses of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 mm. During a test, the specimen is <b>clamped</b> between blank <b>holder</b> and die holder, heated to a specific temperature, and formed by applying constant gas pressure. The experiments were conducted at different temperatures for OT 4 - 1 titanium alloy. The constitutive constants were obtained by processing the experimental data using two different techniques and compared with tensile test results. In order to estimate the influence of friction on the experimental results and to verify obtained material characteristics, finite element (FE) simulation was performed. Finally, the results of FE simulation were compared with the experimental data. The results of the simulation show the advantage of material characterization based on multi dome tests and its interpretation by inverse analysis. The deviations produced by the effect of friction are more significant when the direct approach is applied instead of inverse analysis with a semi analytical model of the bulging process...|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} work {{was carried out}} on a CNC lathe (5.5  kW spindle power and 3500  rpm maximum rotational speed). Due {{to the importance of}} the dry machining in the modern industry, the tests were performed under the dry condition without any fluid, gas, and/or solid coolant. Standard CBN inserts (ISO code CNGA 120404 S 010 - 30 A, CNGA 120408 S 010 - 30 A, CNGA 120412 S 010 - 30 A) made by Sandvik™ Coromant were used as the cutting tools with the following geometry: clearance angle = 0 °, chamfer angle = 30 °, chamfer width = 0.10  mm, edge thickness = 4.76  mm, edge length = 12  mm, and rhombic tip angle = 80 °. The same inserts with different nose radius of 0.4  mm, 0.8  mm, and 1.2  mm were used for analysis of the nose radius effect. In order to have a stable cutting condition, each experiment was performed with a new sharp insert. The inserts grade was CB 7025, which is completely suitable for hard turning operation. The tool holder used in the experiments was standard DCBNR/L- 2525 [*]M. According to the cutting tool manufacturer’s recommendation, the inserts were <b>clamped</b> on the <b>holder</b> with the tightening torque of 3.9  Nm. Round bars of MDN 250 steel with 35  mm diameter and 85  mm length were used for the experiments. In order to increase the hardness of the steel, according to the ASM International standard, the round bars have been heated at about 850  °C for 75  min, and then quickly quenched in the water (Dossett and Boyer 2006). Subsequent aging was performed for approximately 3  h at a temperature of 500  °C to produce a fine dispersion of Ni 3 (X,Y) intermetallic phases along the dislocations left by martensitic transformation, where X and Y are solute elements added for such precipitation. A pre-cut with 0.5  mm cutting depth was performed before hardening the steel to remove the rusts and oxide layers {{from the surface of the}} workpiece. Finally, the hardness level of 55 HRC was obtained by performing the heat treatment method for the round bars of MDN 250 steel. Average surface roughness (Ra) values were recorded with a Surftest 301 Mitutoyo® roughness meter set to a cut-off of 0.8  mm. The surface roughness values were measured at five equally spaced locations along the cutting length. The average of this five roughness values was taken as the arithmetic surface roughness value (Ra). This measuring process was repeated three times for each test and their average was considered as the final surface roughness. A piezoelectric type vibration meter was used to measure and recorded the acceleration of the radial holder vibration. Three forces component, i.e., feed force, cutting force, and radial force, was measured precisely by using a Kistler piezoelectric turning dynamometer and a signal amplifier connected to a control unit, data acquisition board and microcomputer. The maximum flank wear (VBmax) was measured using a TM 505 Mitutoyo® toolmaker’s microscope with 1  μm resolution. The dimensional accuracy, which is defined as the difference between the desired cutting depth and the obtained depth of cut, was determined by measuring the final dimensional deviation. The diameter deviation was measured using a precision dial gauge with an accuracy of ±[*] 0.01  mm. Diameter deviation was measured at five equally spaced points along the cutting length and the average of these five values considered as the final dimensional deviation value. In this paper, insert nose radius, feed rate, cutting depth, and speed were considered as the processing parameters. The values of the variables were chosen according to the recommendation of the cutting tool catalogs. In order to conduct a comprehensive study, the cutting depth and feed speed with a wider range were selected compared with the ranges chosen by the previous researchers in the hard turning operation. Furthermore, to increase the confidence level of the results, all the measurements were repeated three times for each test.|$|R
