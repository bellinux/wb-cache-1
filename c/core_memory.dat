5|$|As {{a result}} of {{experience}} gained from the Mark 1, the developers concluded that computers would be used more in scientific roles than pure maths. They therefore embarked {{on the design of}} a new machine which would include a floating point unit; work began in 1951. The resulting machine, which ran its first program in May 1954, was known as Meg, or the megacycle machine. It was smaller and simpler than the Mark 1, as well as quicker at solving maths problems. Ferranti produced a commercial version marketed as the Ferranti Mercury, in which the Williams tubes were replaced by the more reliable <b>core</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the hardware architecture and the software abstraction layer of an adaptive multiclient Network-on-Chip (NoC) <b>memory</b> <b>core.</b> The <b>memory</b> <b>core</b> supports {{the flexibility of}} a heterogeneous FPGA-based runtime adaptive multiprocessor system called RAMPSoC. The processing elements, also called clients, can access the <b>memory</b> <b>core</b> via the Network-on-Chip (NoC). The <b>memory</b> <b>core</b> supports a dynamic mapping of an address space for the different clients as well as different data transfer modes, such as variable burst sizes. Therefore, two main limitations of FPGA-based multiprocessor systems, the restricted on-chip memory resources and that usually only one physical channel to an off-chip memory exists, are leveraged. Furthermore, a software abstraction layer is introduced, which hides {{the complexity of the}} <b>memory</b> <b>core</b> architecture and which provides an easy to use interface for the application programmer. Finally, the advantages of the novel <b>memory</b> <b>core</b> in terms of performance, flexibility, and user friendliness are shown using a real-world image processing application...|$|R

5|$|As Sadness reinstalls {{the core}} memories, turning them sad, Riley arrives {{home to her}} parents and breaks down crying, confessing that she misses Minnesota. As her parents comfort her, they tell her that they also miss Minnesota and Joy and Sadness work the console together, {{creating}} a new <b>core</b> <b>memory</b> that combines their emotions; a new island forms representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco. In the end, a year later {{at the age of}} 12, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, returned to her old hobbies, and adopted a few new ones (fueled by new, more nuanced core memories from combinations of her emotions). Inside Headquarters, her emotions all work together on a new expanded console with room for them all, allowing Riley to lead a more emotionally complex life.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Riley and {{her parents}} move to San Francisco for her father's new business. Riley has poor first experiences: the new house is cramped and old, the moving van with all their {{belongings}} is misdirected, her father is under stress from his business, and a poor encounter at a pizza restaurant leaves her disheartened. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness accidentally causes Riley to cry {{in front of her}} class, creating a sad <b>core</b> <b>memory.</b> Joy, panicking, tries to dispose of it, but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters, and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory.|$|E

25|$|There {{were also}} four {{locations}} in <b>core</b> <b>memory,</b> at addresses 20-23, dubbed editing locations because whatever was stored there would emerge shifted or rotated by one bit position, {{except for one}} that shifted right seven bit positions, to extract one of the seven-bit interpretive op. codes that were packed two to a word. This was common to Block I and Block II AGCs.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} elsewhere, <b>core</b> <b>memory</b> {{had long}} since been slower than many CPU designs. The advent of semiconductor memory reduced this difference, {{but it was still}} apparent that more registers (and later caches) would allow higher CPU operating frequencies. Additional registers would require sizeable chip or board areas which, at the time (1975), could be made available if the complexity of the CPU logic was reduced.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1952, a {{high-speed}} shifter was added, which improved the speed for shifting {{by a factor}} of five. In July 1953, a 100-word expansion <b>core</b> <b>memory</b> was added to the system, using binary coded decimal, excess-3 number representation. To support this expansion memory, ENIAC was equipped with a new Function Table selector, a memory address selector, pulse-shaping circuits, and three new orders were added to the programming mechanism.|$|E

25|$|The first rotating-drum {{storage device}} {{was used in}} the Birkbeck Automatic Relay Computer {{developed}} by Andrew Booth and Kathleen Booth in 1948. By 1954, magnetic <b>core</b> <b>memory</b> was rapidly displacing most other forms of temporary storage, including the Williams tube. It went on to dominate the field through the mid-1970s. A key feature of the American UNIVAC I system of 1951 was the implementation of a newly invented type of metal magnetic tape, and a high-speed tape unit, for non-volatile storage. Magnetic tape is still used in many computers.|$|E

25|$|Many second-generation CPUs {{delegated}} {{peripheral device}} communications to a secondary processor. For example, while the communication processor controlled card reading and punching, the main CPU executed calculations and binary branch instructions. One databus would bear data between the main CPU and <b>core</b> <b>memory</b> at the CPU's fetch-execute cycle rate, and other databusses would typically serve the peripheral devices. On the PDP-1, the core memory's cycle time was 5 microseconds; consequently most arithmetic instructions took 10 microseconds (100,000 operations per second) because most operations took {{at least two}} memory cycles; one for the instruction, one for the operand data fetch.|$|E
25|$|The Security Extensions, {{marketed as}} TrustZone Technology, is in ARMv6KZ and later {{application}} profile architectures. It provides a low-cost alternative to adding another dedicated security core to an SoC, by providing two virtual processors backed by hardware based access control. This lets the application core switch between two states, {{referred to as}} worlds (to reduce confusion with other names for capability domains), {{in order to prevent}} information from leaking from the more trusted world to the less trusted world. This world switch is generally orthogonal to all other capabilities of the processor, thus each world can operate independently of the other while using the same <b>core.</b> <b>Memory</b> and peripherals are then made aware of the operating world of the core and may use this to provide access control to secrets and code on the device.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, {{computer}} memory and mass storage were scarce and expensive. Early <b>core</b> <b>memory</b> cost one dollar per bit. Popular commercial computers, {{such as the}} IBM 1401, shipped with as little as 2kilobytes of memory. Programs often mimicked card processing techniques. Commercial programming languages of the time, such as COBOL and RPG, processed numbers in their character representations. Over time the punched cards were converted to magnetic tape and then disc files, but {{the structure of the}} data usually changed very little. Data was still input using punched cards until the mid-1970s. Machine architectures, programming languages and application designs were evolving rapidly. Neither managers nor programmers of that time expected their programs to remain in use for many decades. The realisation that databases were a new type of program with different characteristics had not yet come.|$|E

500|$|Any {{target with}} a high {{probability}} was then passed to the Battery Control Data Processor (BCDP), which selected missiles and radars for an attack. This started with the assignment of a Target Tracking Radar (TTR) to a target passed to it from the DCC. TTRs operated in the C band from 5250â5750MHz at 10MW, allowing tracking of a 0.1m2 target at , a range they expected {{to be able to}} double with a new maser-based receiver design. Once targets were being successfully tracked and a firing order was received, the BCDP selected available Zeus missiles for launch and assigned a Missile Tracking Radar (MTR) to follow them. These were much smaller radars operating in the X-band between 8500â9600MHz and assisted by a transponder on the missile, using only 300kW to provide missile tracking to [...] The wide variety of available frequencies allowed up to 450 MTRs to be operating in a single Defense Center. Information from the ZDR, TTR and MRTs was all fed to the Target Intercept Computer (TIC) which handled the interceptions. This used twistor memory for ROM and <b>core</b> <b>memory</b> for RAM. Guidance commands were sent to the missiles in-flight via modulation of the MTR signal.|$|E
500|$|Two {{independent}} dual-CPU computers, A and B, {{form the}} controller; giving redundancy to the system. The failure of controller system A automatically {{leads to a}} switch-over to controller system B without impeding operational capabilities; the subsequent failure of controller system B would provide a graceful shutdown of the engine. Within each system (A and B), the two M68000s operate in [...] "lock-step", thereby enabling each system to detect failures by comparing the signal levels on the buses of the two M68000 processors within that system. If differences are encountered between the two buses, then an interrupt is generated and control {{turned over to the}} other system. Because of subtle differences between M68000s from Motorola and the second source manufacturer TRW, each system uses M68000s from the same manufacturer (for instance system A would have two Motorola CPUs while system B would have two CPUs manufactured by TRW). Memory for block I controllers was of the plated-wire type, which functions {{in a manner similar to}} magnetic <b>core</b> <b>memory</b> and retains data even after power is turned off. Block II controllers used conventional CMOS static RAM.|$|E
