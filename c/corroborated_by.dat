His mother, however, tells him that the children are not his, a malicious lie that she tries to <b>corroborate</b> <b>by</b> bribing a male kitchen servant to enter the empress's bed while she is asleep. Octavian is taken to the room, sees the boy, kills him at once and holds his severed head in stark accusation before his terrified wife as she wakes from sleep.|$|R

5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, from {{a limited}} number of specimens, suggested that there was gene flow within the continental Asian populations until the 20th century reductions in range, and that Australia was colonized only in the Late Pleistocene, some 35,000 years ago. This has been <b>corroborated</b> <b>by</b> nDNA microsatellite analyses with four times the sample size. This study further suggests that the Australian population is quite inbred. As there exists the possibility of (limited) hybridization with the genetically distinct brolga, the Australian sarus crane can be expected to be an incipient species.|$|E

50|$|But Photo-Leucine's {{advantages}} go further, {{because in}} addition to having a lot of advantages, it doesn't have negative effects. For example, although unnatural amino acids are in general toxic to cells, photo-leucine has been proved not to have any substantial effect to cell viability. Those results have been <b>corroborate</b> <b>by</b> many experiments. For example, an essay with Escherichia coli -galactosidase showed that the addition of either of the three photo-amino acids or of a mixture of them had no effect on enzyme activity. That helps to conclude that photo-amino acids are nontoxic to cultivated mammalian cells and can, at least partially, functionally replace their natural forms.|$|R

This view he further <b>corroborates</b> <b>by</b> another inscription, on the altar of Apollo, which mentions the children of Hippias and not those of his brothers; 'for it was natural for the eldest to be married first'; and besides this, on the score of general probability he points out that, had Hippias been the younger, he would not have so easily obtained the tyranny on the death of Hipparchos.|$|R

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{contagious}} viruses of animals and is recognised as the most important constraint to international trade in animals and animal products. Two fundamental problems remain to be understood before more effective control measures can be put in place. These problems are the FMDV "carrier state" and the short duration of immunity after vaccination which contrasts with prolonged immunity after natural infection. Here we show by laser capture microdissection in combination with quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemical analysis and <b>corroborate</b> <b>by</b> in situ hybridization that FMDV locates rapidly to, and is maintained in, the light zone of germinal centres following primary infection of naïve cattle. We propose that maintenance of non-replicating FMDV in these sites represents a source of persisting infectious virus and also contributes to the generation of long-lasting antibody responses against neutralising epitopes of the virus...|$|R
40|$|The present {{article is}} a case report of a 16 -year-old boy who {{presented}} with a benign bony tumour, which on histological analysis suggested giant cell reparative granuloma (GCRG), but was not <b>corroborate</b> <b>by</b> blood tests. The implications {{of this type of}} tumour and the correct diagnostic requirements were investigated. The correct identification of GCRG from other giant cell-containing tumours is important because the treatment modalities for these tumours significantly differ from one another. In most cases, histological findings are sufficient to identify the tumours. In most GCRG cases, curettage is usually a curative treatment option. However, due to high recurrence rates of GCRGs, close follow-up of these patients is warranted. Also, due to osteoclastic activity of the giant cells in GCRGs, the use of drugs such as calcitonin or bisphosphonates, which inhibit osteoclast differentiation and activation, may have an important influence on future treatments or in reducing the recurrence rate of these tumours...|$|R

5|$|After a lack {{of records}} from the first millennium, Zaprešić again became known in the late 11thcentury. In 1094, {{following}} {{the formation of the}} Zagreb Diocese, Ača, an advisor of the Croato–Hungarian King Ladislav I, was granted land west and east of the Medvednica Mountain to protect the newly formed diocese. Zaprešić became part of the Susedgrad–Stubica manor, the second-biggest estate in the Croato-Hungarian Zagreb County. In 1334, the parish church of St. Peter was founded in Zaprešić, marking the first evidence of the modern settlement of Zaprešić. The settlement developed rapidly, which is attributed to its position on important trade and transit routes. This was <b>corroborated</b> <b>by</b> the route of the first railway in Croatia, which passes through Zaprešić.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Myres's {{idea of the}} Homeric house, or, at least, of {{the house}} of Odysseus, is that the women had a meguron, or common hall, apart from that of the men, with other chambers. These did not lie to the direct rear of the men's hall, nor were they entered by a door that opened in the back wall of the men's hall. Penelope has a chamber, in which she sleeps and does woman's work, upstairs; her connubial chamber, unoccupied during her lord's absence, is {{certainly}} on the ground floor. The women's rooms are severed from the men's hall by a courtyard; in the courtyard are chambers. Telemachus has his [Greek: Thalamos], or chamber, in the men's courtyard.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} and pCO 2 {{on the development}} of bacterial communities were investigated in mesocosm experiments with Baltic Sea water, during a diatom bloom in autumn and during a cyanobacterial bloom in summer. We measured prokaryotic cell numbers and activity and used 454 pyrosequencing to compare the development of the bacterial community composition (BCC) and to identify the major bacterial taxa. Organic matter dynamics were assessed to differentiate between direct effects and indirect phytoplankton induced effects. The development of BCC followed well-known bloom dynamics. A principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) of bacterial OTUs (operational taxonomic units) revealed that phytoplankton succession and temperature were the major bacterial community structuring variables whereas only a very weak impact of pCO 2 was found. This was <b>corroborate</b> <b>by</b> the trends in bacterial bulk parameters. However, significant effects of pCO 2 on the relative abundance of individual dominant OTUs occurred. Our results suggest that increasing pCO 2 only slightly affects the development of overall bacterial community composition but impacts specific bacterial groups which might influence also particular organic matter degradation processes...|$|R
