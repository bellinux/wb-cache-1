5|$|After an {{exhibition}} rout of US Armed Forces, the Lady Vols {{opened up the}} season unusually, with a conference game against Mississippi. Semeka Randall did not start the game. However, four minutes into the game, the Lady Vols were only up 4–2. At this point, Randall was put into the game, and Tennessee scored fifteen straight, on a run fueled by her. Randall scored 24, and star Chamique Holdsclaw added 23. This season opener has <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> anticipation, as {{it was expected that}} this would be the game where all four of Tennessee's freshman played together. However, during a November practice, Clement had injured her foot, resulting in a stress fracture. After a discussion with the team doctor, Clement agreed to sit out the Mississippi game {{in order to be able}} to play the next game, against Louisiana Tech.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> noise.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{expedition}} ended in failure {{the members of}} the Uitvoerend Bewind became very nervous {{in the days before the}} Battle of Bergen. The Agent for Foreign Affairs, Van der Goes who had been in favor of distancing the Republic from the French, chose this inopportune moment to secretly approach the King of Prussia as a mediator, with a scheme in which the Hereditary Prince was to become a kind of constitutional monarch in a constitution on the model of the American Constitution. The Republic would revert to its traditional neutrality, while Britain would occupy North Holland, and France Zeeland. The overture was rejected, and it <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> embarrassment in the relations with the French Directoire. At this time Napoleon Bonaparte performed his coup of 18 Brumaire, establishing the French Consulate. The Franco-Batavian relations now entered a whole new era.|$|E

25|$|The slow flowing {{nature of}} the streams <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{siltation}} in the pool, this combined with it {{being used as a}} sewer for the Close caused it to become dirty. In 1772 the pool was cleaned and landscaped by the Corporation. Poet Anna Seward was instrumental in landscaping the pool into a serpentine shape and developing a ‘New Walk’ along its southern bank. By the mid 19th century it had become dirty again and five feet of mud was dredged in 1855. During these works cannonballs and shells from the Civil War were found in the mud.|$|E
25|$|The name 'spiders' {{was coined}} by Malin Space Science Systems personnel, the {{developers}} of the camera. One {{of the first}} and most interesting spider photos was found by Greg Orme in October 2000. The unusual shape and appearance of these 'spider webs' and spots <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> speculation about their origin. The first years' surveillance showed that during the following Martian years, 70% of the spots appear at exactly the same place, and a preliminary statistical study obtained between September 1999 and March 2005, indicated that dark dune spots and spiders are related phenomena as functions of the cycle of carbon dioxide (CO2) ice condensation and sublimation.|$|E
25|$|The last {{match of}} the show was a tag team match for the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. Eddie Gilbert and Rick Steiner defended the titles against Varsity Club members Kevin Sullivan and Dan Spivey. As the match started, Spivey {{attacked}} Steiner outside the floor and drove him into the ringpost, thus putting him out of action. This gave control of the match to Spivey and Sullivan, who double-teamed Gilbert throughout the match. Steiner recovered and climbed on the apron for a false tag. This <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> confusion, which caused Steiner to deliver a Lariat, which he called Steiner-Line, to Sullivan, allowing Gilbert to pin Sullivan with a Sunset Flip to retain the titles.|$|E

25|$|Following the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979 {{there was}} a {{transition}} to internationally recognized majority rule in 1980; the United Kingdom ceremonially granted Zimbabwe independence on 18 April that year. In the 2000s Zimbabwe's economy began to deteriorate due to various factors, including, the imposition of sanctions, such as among others the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001, following the switch from Willing Buyer, Willing Seller to Fast Track land reform and also due to intensive economic corruption. Economic instability <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Zimbabweans to move overseas or to neighboring countrys. Prior to its recognized independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the nation had been known by several names: Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia and Zimbabwe Rhodesia.|$|E
25|$|With {{the right}} {{connections}} at the Shipping Board, ships could be bought cheaply, which <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fraud. This system was too complicated {{for the oil}} companies however, so when World War II started, independents owned 39 {{percent of the world}} tanker fleet. This was especially because oil companies needed capital to invest in the growing oil market. By not buying the ships, but chartering, the bond rating of the oil companies was not affected, because the charter hire was not recognized as debt in that time. In 1934 H.T. Schierwater founded the International Tanker Owners’ Association — later International Association of Independent Tanker Owners or INTERTANKO — to protect the interests of these companies in a strongly fluctuating market.|$|E
25|$|The stormy sea created big {{problems}} for the torpedo boats when their propellers were lifted {{too close to the}} surface. This reduced their efficiency and what worsened the situation {{was the fact that the}} S2s bearings were worn out, which <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> vibrations in the ship and threatened to open up a leak where the shaft went through the hull. Both of the torpedo boats began taking in water in the high seas. This was mainly due to the construction of the superstructure. The coal was also slowly running out since the crew had to feed more into the boilers than usual due to the high seas. The flotilla leader Klas Horn sent out a distress call on behalf of the torpedo boats. The rescue ship Protector, which was located in Vaasa, received the distress call through the Finnish headquarters in Helsinki, and the message was also received by the Swedish rescue vessel Helios. Both promised that they would come to the rescue.|$|E

25|$|The Croatian ethnonym Hrvat, as well {{of those}} five {{brothers}} and sisters and the early ruler Porga, are not considered to be of Slavic origin, yet again, are quite original to be a pure fabrication of Constantine VII. As such, the origin of the early Croats before and at the time of arrival to the present day Croatia, as well their ethnonym, were an eternal topic of historiography, linguistics and archeology. However, the theories were often elaborated in non-scientific terms, supported by specific ideological intentions, and often by political and cultural intentions of the time. This kind of interpretations <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> damage to certain theories and actual scientific community. It should be taken into serious consideration whether the origin of the early Croatian tribes can be regarded also as the origin of Croatian nation, and can only be asserted that the Croats as are known today as a nation became only when Croatian tribes arrived in the territory of present-day Croatia.|$|E
25|$|Kate now {{has three}} {{suspects}} for Janet's death: Clarkville, Moon, and Luellen May (a fellow professor who found Janet passed {{out in the}} bathtub at a party). After a visit from Janet's brother and a tour of Janet's old apartment, Kate begins to put some ideas together about what really happened to Janet. Kate then visits with Clarkville once more to discuss his finding of Janet's body. In the meeting, Clarkville explains that the last time anyone had seen Janet alive was in the department meeting. During the meeting, Janet had become hysterical about an issue that <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> tension in the room. Kate then gets Clarkville to admit to moving Janet's body to the men's room {{for her to be}} 'discovered'. Clarkville explains that he had originally found Janet in the chairman's office dead and decided to move her to a restroom (the men's room was the closest) and reported finding her there. Kate then is granted access to Janet's office at the university and finds a poem that she believes is the biggest clue to Janet's death.|$|E
25|$|According to the Constitution of Denmark, Denmark {{is governed}} {{according}} {{to the principle of}} negative parliamentarism, meaning that while a government doesn't need the majority of seats in parliament, it must never have a majority of seats against it in a vote of no confidence. Before the ongoing elections, this was relevant since the government, consisting of the Conservative People's Party and the Liberals did not have a majority of seats, but depended on the support of the Danish People's Party. Early opinion polls showed that neither a right-wing or a left-wing government could gather enough seats to be in government without the support of the newly established New Alliance. This <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> interest, since New Alliance had stated that they would first give the government the opportunity to propose a programme for government, but that they would not definitely support a right-wing government prior to seeing how many of their political agendas they could work together on. Many people were unsure how this would be possible, since New Alliance was originally formed to limit the influence of the Danish People's Party, without whom a right-wing government did not seem possible in opinion polls. After the elections, however, it was clear that New Alliance did not get enough seats in parliament to break the previous right-wing majority.|$|E
