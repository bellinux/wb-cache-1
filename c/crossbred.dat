5|$|<b>Crossbred</b> cows produce up to, and in {{some cases}} in excess of, 20% more weaned calf weight as a result of {{increased}} reproductive performance and maternal ability. <b>Crossbred</b> cow longevity is also increased by up to two years when compared with straightbred cows. However, the benefits of hybrid vigour in a <b>crossbred</b> cow decline in subsequent generations if progeny are mated to cattle of parentage similar to the cow, and increase if a new breed is introduced. Although studies acknowledge that the major production benefits of hybrid vigour occur in <b>crossbred</b> cow herds, the main use of Limousins outside of Europe continues to be as terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds.|$|E

Purebred Percherons are also ridden, and some have proven useful at show jumping. <b>Crossbred</b> Percherons have been used successfully in dressage. In both the Falkland Islands and northern Australia, Percherons have been crossed with local mares, primarily Criollos in the Falklands, to produce larger stock horses with greater stamina.

40|$|A {{breeding}} program aims {{to develop}} a chicken population inherent for heat tolerance and fast growth was started using a naked-neck local breed in Egypt that performs heat tolerance. The local breed was crossed with the sire line of a normally feathered commercial broiler strain. The <b>crossbreds</b> were raised in a heating treatment (35 o C from hatch to 6 weeks, then reduced to 24 o C) or a non-heating treatment (35 o C from hatch to 3 days, and reduced gradually to reach 24 °C). Body weights of the <b>crossbreds,</b> across ages, were significantly around twofold heavier {{than those of the}} locals. The <b>crossbreds</b> weighed 641. 8 g at 6 weeks of age versus 303. 0 g for the locals. The 2 - 4 week growth rate was 73. 7 % for the <b>crossbreds</b> versus 60. 2 % for the locals. The Na/na <b>crossbreds</b> were significantly heavier than na/na <b>crossbreds</b> when heated, and the differences were not significant when non-heated. The spread of 6 -week body weights of the <b>crossbreds</b> was remarkably {{different from that of the}} locals and the difference was mainly attributed to the variation brought in through the flow of genes. The heterotic effects on body weights were significant in both heated and non-heated <b>crossbreds</b> and expressed a large source of non-additive genetic variation. Heterosis estimates in body weights and growth rates were age and environment specific, and were significantly higher for the heated than for non-heated <b>crossbreds,</b> indicating the flow of genes influence growth and heat tolerance. The results demonstrate remarkable changes in the frequencies of non-allelic genes that influence growth and propose the genetic selection for increased 6 -week body weight in the naked-neck and normally feathered <b>crossbreds...</b>|$|R

5|$|There {{are several}} American horse breeds with leopard {{coloring}} and Appaloosa ancestry. These include the Pony of the Americas and the Colorado Ranger.

In 1995 the Nez Perce tribe began a program to develop a new and distinct horse breed, the Nez Perce Horse, based on crossbreeding the Appaloosa with the Akhal-Teke breed from Central Asia.

40|$|Objective The Bashang Long-tail chicken (BS), an {{indigenous}} Chinese breed, is considered cold tolerant. We selected BS, the Rhode Island Red (RIR), and their reciprocal <b>crossbreds</b> {{for the present}} study. The objectives were: i) to validate whether BS is cold tolerant and whether egg production and cold tolerance of <b>crossbreds</b> could be improved; and ii) to determine the physiological characteristics that underlie cold tolerance and favorable egg production performance in cold environments. Methods A total of 916 chickens were reared in warm and natural cold environments (daily mean ambient temperature varied from 7. 4 °C to 26. 5 °C in the warm environment and from − 17. 5 °C to 27. 0 °C in the cold environment). To investigate their adaptability to the cold environment, the egg production performance and body weight were monitored and compared between breeds and environments. The cloacal temperature and serum biochemical parameters were monitored to reveal the physiological characteristics underlie cold tolerance and favorable egg production performance in the cold environment. Results The warm environment experiment showed that RIR had the highest egg production performance, and that the reciprocal <b>crossbreds</b> had a higher egg production performance than BS. While in the cold environment RIR had the lowest egg production performance, and the reciprocal <b>crossbreds</b> had a higher egg production performance than BS. In the cold environment BS and reciprocal <b>crossbreds</b> had higher triiodothyronine, tetraiodothyronine levels than RIR. At 35 and 39 wk of age, when the ambient temperature was extremely low (varied from − 20 °C to 0 °C), serum glucose, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol of BS and <b>crossbreds</b> were higher than RIR. Conclusion Bashang Long-tail chicken has a favorable cold tolerance ability. Crossbreeding with RIR and BS is {{an effective way to}} develop cold tolerant chickens with improved egg production performance...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of chosen factors (<b>crossbreds,</b> sex, litter size, age of ewes and interaction between sex and litter size) on the growth of lambs <b>crossbreds</b> of the breeds Charollais (Ch), Suffolk (Sf) and Improved Valachian (IV). The evaluation was performed in the year 2004 on the farm Růžďka and involved altogether 96 lambs. The growth ability was evaluated at the following crossbreds: Ch x Sf (n = 28), (Ch x Sf) x Sf (n = 28), IV x Sf (n = 21) and (IV x Sf) x Sf (n = 19). All lambs under study were born indoor in January. Lambs were kept indoor {{till the end of}} the evaluation. From the evaluation of effects of <b>crossbreds,</b> sex and age of ewes on the live body weights and daily gains of lambs above all result that these factors showed a significant effect only on the live body weight at birth. On the other hand, the factors of litter size and interaction between sex and litter size showed a highly significant (P < 0. 01) effect on the live body weights of lambs at birth, at 70 and at 100 days of age as well as on their daily gains within the intervals from birth to 70 and 100 days of age. It can be concluded that the daily gains were highly uniform but relatively low in all <b>crossbreds</b> under the study within the time interval from birth to the age of 100 days, while the non-significantly highest daily gain was recorded in the <b>crossbreds</b> of IV x Sf (211  g).
