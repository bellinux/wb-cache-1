In solar system tropospheres and stratospheres there are two distinct cluster regimes: the terrestrial planets contain largely hydrated clusters (i. e. Y=HO), whereas the gas planets and their moons have organic or nitrogenated cluster species. These classifications are largely based on model predictions, since hardly any measurements are available. The few existing composition measurements are reviewed, including the recent detection of massive charged particles in Titan's upper atmosphere. Technologies for both remote sensing and in situ measurements of atmospheric charged clusters are discussed. Preliminary measurements in the terrestrial atmosphere are presented indicating that ambient charged cluster species interact with downwelling infra-red radiation at 9. 15 μm, even in the presence of cloud.

The present work assesses the applicability of the reagents in <b>Chemical</b> <b>Ionisation</b> Mass Spectrometric (CI-TOF-MS) environments with factors such as high moisture content, operating pressures of 1 - 10 Torr, accelerating electric fields (E/N) and long-lived intermediate complex formation. Of the commonly used <b>chemical</b> <b>ionisation</b> reagents, H 3 O(+) and NO(+) only react with hexane and higher while O 2 (+) reacts with all the target samples, but creates significant fragmentation. By contrast, CF 3 (+) and CF 2 H(+) acting together were found to produce little or no fragmentation. In dry conditions with E/N = 100 Td or higher the relative intensity of CF 2 H(+) to CF 3 (+) was mostly less than 1 % but always less than 3 %, making CF 3 (+) the main reagent ion. Using O 2 (+) in a parallel series of experiments, a substantially greater degree of fragmentation was observed. The detection sensitivities of the alkanes with CF 3 (+) and CF 2 H(+), while relatively low, were found to be better than those observed with O 2 (+). Experiments using alkane mixtures in the ppm range have shown the ionisation technique based on CF 3 (+) and CF 2 H(+) to be particularly useful for measurements of alkane/air mixtures found in polluted environments. As a demonstration of the technique's effectiveness in complex mixtures, the detection of n-alkanes in a smoker's breath is demonstrated. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|E

We pinpoint the error in the proof that all systems have positive specific heat and say when it can occur. We discuss the development of the thermal runaway in both the gravothermal catastrophe and its inverse. The energy range over which microcanonical ensembles have negative heat capacity is replaced by a first order phase transition in the corresponding canonical ensembles. We conjecture that all first order phase transitions may be viewed as caused by negative heat capacities of units within them.

40|$|We {{present a}} series of {{hydrodynamic}} simulations of isolated galaxies with stellar mass of 10 ^ 9 M_. The models use a resolution of 750 M_ per particle and include a treatment for the full non-equilibrium chemical evolution of ions and molecules (157 species in total), along with gas cooling rates computed self-consistently using the non-equilibrium abundances. We compare these to simulations evolved using cooling rates calculated assuming <b>chemical</b> (including <b>ionisation)</b> equilibrium, and we consider {{a wide range of}} metallicities and UV radiation fields, including a local prescription for self-shielding by gas and dust. We find higher star formation rates and stronger outflows at higher metallicity and for weaker radiation fields, as gas can more easily cool to a cold (few hundred Kelvin) star forming phase under such conditions. Contrary to variations in the metallicity and the radiation field, non-equilibrium chemistry generally has no strong effect on the total star formation rates or outflow properties. However, it is important for modelling molecular outflows. For example, the mass of H_ 2 outflowing with velocities > 50 km s^- 1 is enhanced by a factor ∼ 20 in non-equilibrium. We also compute the observable line emission from CII and CO. Both are stronger at higher metallicity, while CII and CO emission are higher for stronger and weaker radiation fields respectively. We find that CII is generally unaffected by non-equilibrium chemistry. However, emission from CO varies by a factor of ∼ 2 - 4. This has implications for the mean X_CO conversion factor between CO emission and H_ 2 column density, which we find is lowered by up to a factor ∼ 2. 3 in non-equilibrium, and for the fraction of CO-dark molecular gas.

40|$|Radio and X-ray {{emission}} from {{brown dwarfs}} suggest that an ionised gas and {{a magnetic field}} with a sufficient flux density must be present. We perform a reference study for late M-dwarfs, brown dwarfs and giant gas planet to identify which ultra-cool objects are most susceptible to plasma and magnetic processes. Only thermal ionisation is considered. We utilise the Drift-Phoenix model grid where the local atmospheric structure {{is determined by the}} global parameters T_ eff, (g) and [M/H]. Our results show that it is not unreasonable to expect H_α or radio emission to origin from Brown Dwarf atmospheres as in particular the rarefied upper parts of the atmospheres can be magnetically coupled despite having low degrees of thermal gas ionisation. Such ultra-cool atmospheres could therefore drive auroral emission without the need for a companion's wind or an outgassing moon. The minimum threshold for the magnetic flux density required for electrons and ions to be magnetised is well above typical values of the global magnetic field of a brown dwarf and a giant gas planet. Na^+, K^+ and Ca^+ are the dominating electron donors in low-density atmospheres (low log(g), solar metallicity) independent of T_ eff.

40|$|Abridged) Exoplanet atmospheres {{are thought}} be built up from {{accretion}} of gas {{as well as}} pebbles and planetesimals in the midplanes of planet-forming disks. The chemical composition of this material is usually assumed to be unchanged during the disk lifetime. However, chemistry can alter the relative abundances of molecules in this planet-building material. To {{assess the impact of}} disk chemistry during the era of planet formation, an extensive kinetic chemistry gas-grain reaction network is utilised to evolve the abundances of chemical species over time. Given a high level of <b>ionisation,</b> <b>chemical</b> evolution in protoplanetary disk midplanes becomes significant after a few times $ 10 ^{ 5 }$ yrs, and is still ongoing by 7 Myr between the H$_{ 2 }$O and the O$_{ 2 }$ icelines. Importantly, the changes in the abundances of the major elemental carbon and oxygen-bearing molecules imply that the traditional "stepfunction" for the C/O ratios in gas and ice in the disk midplane (as defined by sharp changes at icelines of H$_{ 2 }$O, CO$_{ 2 }$ and CO) evolves over time, and cannot be assumed fixed. In addition, at lower temperatures (< 29 K), gaseous CO colliding with the grains gets converted into CO$_{ 2 }$ and other more complex ices, lowering the CO gas abundance between the O$_{ 2 }$ and CO thermal icelines. This effect can mimic a CO iceline at a higher temperature than suggested by its binding energy. Chemistry in the disk midplane is ionisation-driven, and evolves over time. In order to reliably predict the atmospheric compositions of forming planets, as well as to relate observed atmospheric C/O ratios of exoplanets to where and how the atmospheres have formed in a disk midplane, chemical evolution needs to be considered and implemented into planet formation models.
