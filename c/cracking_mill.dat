40|$|Graduation date: 2017 CSS- 1 H is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used slow-setting emulsion grade in Oregon. “New” engineered emulsions were recently developed in Oregon to reduce tracking, the pick-up of tack coats by construction vehicle tires during construction activities, and increase interlayer shear strength (ISS), the amount of adhesive bond present between layers of asphalt pavement. Tracking reduces the amount of tack coat in particular areas and creates a non-uniform tack coat distribution between two pavement layers. The non-uniform tack coat distribution leads to localized distresses and significant reductions in interlayer shear strength, leading to complete failure of the pavement structure. The magnitude of this effect and performance of the tack coat is dependent on tack coat type, residual application rate, temperature, existing surface condition (<b>cracked,</b> <b>milled,</b> overlay), and curing time. For this reason, reducing tracking and increasing interlayer shear strength between pavement layers becomes vital to the longevity of the pavement structure. The performance (ability to reduce tracking and increase ISS) of these emulsions, most effective application rates, the effects of pavement surface texture and traffic on ISS, and curing times were evaluated in this study. Results show that lower temperatures and increased application rates lead to longer curing times, while higher wind speeds will reduce curing times. The results indicate that tracking will decrease with increased curing time. Results show that a positive correlation between pavement surface texture and interlayer shear strength exists and that milled surfaces provide significantly higher ISS than non-milled overlay surfaces. The results indicated that there are positive correlations between rheological tests and interlayer shear strengths from field cores. The results also showed significant variances in application rates by distributor trucks. Hence {{there is a need for}} unified guidelines on tack coat QC/QA and construction practices...|$|R

40|$|Grinding mills {{are large}} {{rotating}} cylindrical steel vessels used to grind ore and minerals into finer particles. The mills are {{important parts of}} the mineral enrichment process and the grinding is the last step of the comminution process, where the particle size is reduced {{by a combination of}} abrasion and impact. The rotation of the mill under loaded conditions can result in fatigue cracks. Fatigue cracks and associated failures have been identified as a major problem in mineral processing plants. The cracks lead to unpredicted and unplanned production stoppages for inspections and for repair and replacement of the <b>cracked</b> <b>mill</b> parts. This leads to increasing costs due to production loss, additional man-hours and spare parts. The purpose of the research presented in this licentiate thesis was to calculate the structural strains, stresses, displacements, etc. in grinding mills in operation, to prevent overloading, to calculate crack propagation speeds and critical crack lengths, and to develop new improved mills that would withstand the current loading. This research has also aimed to propose, develop and test methods for the detection and monitoring of fatigue <b>cracks</b> in <b>mills</b> during operation, in order to facilitate optimal maintenance decision-making based on current crack sizes. The performed research is a case study of the secondary pebble mills of LKAB, a mining company in northern Sweden. The mills are situated inside dressing plants KA 1 and KA 2 in Kiruna. To achieve the goals, a number of crack detection and monitoring methods were investigated and evaluated as to their ability to find and monitor fatigue cracks on the running mills. Measurements with wireless strain measurement equipment, infrared thermography and crack propagation sensors were performed on the mills in operation. A finite element model of a mill was developed to calculate the strains and stresses in the mill at any position in the mill and for any loading condition. A variety of spatial discretizations, boundary conditions, material properties and loading alternatives were considered to simulate the behaviour of the real mill in the best possible way. To calculate the loading on the mills in operation, a mathematical model and computer software were developed to calculate the charge configuration, as well as the loading and the magnitude and distribution of the forces acting on the mill in operation. Using the finite element model and the computer software, the global displacement field of the entire mill structure was calculated using quasi-static loading for different inputs of the charge and process parameters. To verify the finite element results, the measured strain ranges for one complete rotation of the mill were compared with the corresponding calculated ones. The numerical results were also verified with logged process data, such as bearing reaction forces. One conclusion, based on the comparisons, is that the developed finite element model and the developed software tools can be considered useful for engineering applications. The developed software tools, together with the finite element model, make it possible to calculate the global displacement field of the entire mill structure for any situation. This is achieved by inputting the desired process data and charge parameters into the software, calculating the loads and force distributions, exporting them to the finite element model, and running the simulation. From the global displacement field, strains, stresses, reaction forces, displacements, etc. can be calculated with standard routines for any position in the mill. The performed research work gives {{a deeper understanding of the}} field of structural analysis and load calculation of grinding mills in operation. The complexity of modelling the behaviour of mills in operation is high. Consequently, it is difficult to obtain accurate estimations of crack propagation speeds and critical crack sizes based on the calculated stresses. It has been found that strain measurements, with strain gauges attached to the mill mandrel, can be used to detect and monitor larger circumferential cracks near the flanges in the mill in operation, since the measured strain ranges increase with the crack size. It has further been found that infrared thermography can be used as a method to indicate cracks without stopping the mill, as the increased thermal gradient around the cracks can be detected by a special type of thermal instrument. Crack propagation sensors have proven to be ideal for high-precision online monitoring of the crack propagation of smaller cracks at the corners of the manholes in the mill. Finally, it has been found that strain measurement is a useful method not only to verify finite element results and to detect and monitor cracks, but also to prevent overloading of the mill and to estimate charge features such as the filling level, the charge shape and the position of the charge circumferentially inside the mill during operation.

A series of novel experimental techniques have been developed and applied to understand oxidation and corrosion effects on comb cracks. Furthermore microstructure changes {{in the region of}} the comb <b>cracks</b> on worn <b>milling</b> inserts were studied by high resolution microscopy. It has been observed that the main effect of the oxidation and corrosion on comb cracks is connected to an attack of the binder phase, affecting its composition, distribution and morphology. Different comb crack types for dry and wet milling have been observed. In the presence of cooling media (wet machining) inserts present lateral cracks (fatigue induced) connected to the principal comb crack, which form at regions where the binder has been strongly corroded. Despite the addition of Cr and (Ta,Nb) C enhance both the oxidation and corrosion attack resistance have a minor effect on the formation and propagation of comb cracks. Schematic models based on the experimental results and scientific discussions are presented to understand the influence of oxidation and corrosion in the formation and propagation of comb cracks. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that the addition of continuous or milled GdAlO(3) /Al(2) O(3) fibers to a dental porcelain increases its mechanical properties. Porcelain bars without reinforcement (control) were compared to those reinforced with long fibers (30 vol%). Also, disk specimens reinforced with milled fibers were produced by adding 0 (control), 5 or 10 vol% of particles. The reinforcement with continuous fibers resulted in significant increase in the uniaxial flexural strength from 91. 5 to 217. 4 MPa. The addition of varied amounts of milled fibers to the porcelain did not significantly affect its biaxial flexural strength compared to the control group. SEM analysis showed that the interface between the continuous fiber and the porcelain was free of defects. On the other hand, it was possible to note the presence of <b>cracks</b> surrounding the <b>milled</b> fiber/porcelain interface. In conclusion, the reinforcement of the porcelain with continuous fibers resulted in an efficient mechanism to increase its mechanical properties; however the addition of milled fibers had no significant effect on the material because the porcelain was not able to wet the ceramic particles during the firing cycle.

The model consisted of external and internal flow domains. The external domain was used to predict stagnation pressures generated by wind impinging on the mill’s walls. The internal domain was used to predict fumigant leakage rates in terms of HLT. <b>Cracks</b> on the <b>mill’s</b> walls represented the effective leakage areas on the internal flow domain. This modeling approach had {{been used by the}} authors (Chayaprasert and Maier) in a previous study, but it was simplified and improved in the present study. The primary simplification in the modeling approach was exclusion of the flour mill’s interior details (e. g., milling equipment), reducing the model formulation and simulation computing times. In the previous study, the gas-tightness of the internal flow domain was identified by varying the flow resistance coefficient of the effective leakage areas until the model yielded a HLT value that was close to the one observed from the experimental fumigant concentration data. In the present study, the domain gas-tightness was verified by building pressurization tests. The model was validated using data from one MB and one SF fumigation experiments. The HLTs provided by simulated fumigations were in good agreement with those determined from the experiments.

There are wedges of organic materials such as organic molecule, linear macromolecular, dendritic macromolecular.

The resultant is highly dispersible in various solvents to self-exfoliate into single- and few-layer (≤ 5 layers) graphene nanosheets (GNs). This method is effective, and eco-friendly, edge functionalization of graphite without the basal plane oxidation by ball milling. Therefore, the newly developed ball milling approach, involving neither hazardous chemicals nor tedious procedures, outperforms current processes for mass production of high-quality graphene nanosheets (GNs) at an unprecedented low cost.

This report, prepared by the Portland Cement Association, presents the results of four years of concrete degradation studies which exposed concrete and reinforcing steel, under load and at 180 F, to simulated double-shell slurry, simulated salt cake solution, and a control solution. Exposure length varied from 3 months to 36 months. In all cases, examination of the concrete and reinforcing steel {{at the end of the}} exposure indicated there was no attack, i. e., no evidence of rusting, <b>cracking,</b> disruption of <b>mill</b> scale or loss of strength. Radioactive waste resulting from the chemical processing of reactor fuel for recovery of special nuclear materials (primarily plutonium), has been accumulating at the Hanford Site since 1944. The defense waste is currently being stored in underground waste tanks and in capsules stored in water basins. Current U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) strategy is to emphasize development and implementation of technology for removal, solidification, and final disposition of defense waste at the Savannah River Site first, then at the Hanford Site. Final disposal of waste in tanks at Hanford is expected to consist of in-place stabilization of most tanks. Selected tank wastes may be retrieved. Disposal operations will be carried out during the next several decades. Consequently, defense waste will remain in the existing underground tanks at Hanford for at least several decades. To ensure the safe storage of the waste, the waste storage tanks are being evaluated for continued service as part of the DOE Waste Tank Evaluation Program (AR- 005 - 10 - 02 -G). Technical studies and laboratory tests have been conducted to determine the effect of the stored waste's chemicals and temperature on the reinforced concrete. Waste solutions, which can be chemically aggressive, could come in contact with the reinforced concrete waste tank wall and bottom through breaches in the steel liner. Tests have been conducted to estimate the relative durability of reinforced concrete specimens exposed to two different simulated Hanford waste solutions. - Results of these tests will be used as input to a comprehensive evaluation of the integrity of the single-shell tanks for continued storage of radioactive waste.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to create a}} nite element model that simulates fatigue crack growth in coated {{cemented}} carbide milling inserts. A typical fatigue wear of coated milling tools are comb crack formation on the cutting edges of the tool inserts. Comb cracks initiate from pre-existent cooling cracks in the coating layers. Severe temperature changes occur during the intermittent machining and when using liquid coolant. As a result thermal stresses cause the initial cooling cracks to propagate. With the model this work also aim to model a possible explanation for lateral comb crack formation by introducing a material alteration zone. Chemical attack occurs when wet-milling as the cooling liquid enters the principal comb crack and reacts with the substrate. The presented model is based on WC{Co substrate with TiCN and Al 2 O 3 coatings. The model allow for a quick and comprehensive understanding of fatigue <b>crack</b> growth in <b>milling</b> tools due to simplied loading conditions, which include thermo-mechanical and mechanical stresses. Thermo-mechanical stresses are calculated corresponding to the temperature change during one milling cycle as well as stress contribution corresponding to residual stresses from the coating application process. The mechanical stresses are approximated and applied as pressures. The fatigue crack growth simulation is governed by Paris law and is performed using Extended Finite Element Method technique in ANSYS Mechanical APDL. The result of the simulations indicates that the residual stress state is more accurate using non-linear instead of linear material models, when comparing to experimentally measured stress states. The calculated fatigue cracks path were found to be similar in shape and length to that of a comb crack in early growth stage. The stress levels in the substrate are found to be compressive except for close to the crack tip where the stresses are tensile. The stress level in the proximity of the crack tip are several magnitudes larger than in the surroundings. The crack paths change in anglewere due to the applied mechanical pressure. The length of the crack is found to be inuenced by the thermo-mechanical stresses. The chemical attack zone model was introduced as a circular zone in the WC{Co layer. The zone had its stiness altered to 80 and 120 % of the initial stiness during fatigue crack growth phase. The proposed model did not provide any indication that lateral comb crack forms due to such a stiness change...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{approach has}} long been the main method to investigate the responses associated with metal cutting process such as cutting forces and temperatures and also to optimise the machining operations to accomplish higher productivity. In recent years, with advances in computing power of computers along with development of robust numerical methods such as Finite Element Method (FEM), it has been possible to simulate different machining process under operational conditions. This method can therefore be applied more effectively to optimise the cutting process to achieve higher productivity, while the design requirements are fulfilled simultaneously. Nonetheless, there are some challenges in FE modelling of metal cutting process such as implementation of appropriate constitutive model and well-tuned parameters {{that need to be addressed}} first to attain reliable predictions. In the current study, a methodology is developed to determine the flow stress properties of the work material together with the optimum frictional condition at the tool-chip interface by means of inverse modelling of orthogonal cutting test. The calibrated constitutive model and the friction coefficients are then used to build three dimensional (3 D) FE models to simulate the cutting process under operational conditions. The results of FE simulations are integrated with tailored tool life tests to reduce the number of experiments required for optimisation of machining process. The viability of the presented methodology is evaluated for two different processes; finishing operation of bi-metallic aluminium-grey cast iron component-like samples as well as transverse machining Alloy 718 in aged condition using uncoated cemented carbides. In order to optimise the finishing operation of the bi-metallic workpiece, a limited number of tool life tests are initially carried out under controlled conditions to determine the involved wear mechanism. Microscopic investigations revealed that the main wear mechanism constitutes thermal fatigue <b>cracking.</b> Hence, the <b>milling</b> operation is simulated by means of FEM and the thermally induced stresses at the cutting edge are calculated for certain combinations of cutting parameters including cutting speed, feed per tooth and depth of cut. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is then employed to establish the relation between the cutting parameters and the amount of thermal stresses at the cutting edge. Subsequently, the optimum cutting condition is determined once the amount of thermally induced stresses on the cutting edge and the number of tool engagements per unit length of cut are both minimised. This approach leads to 32 % reduction in cycle time compared to the reference tool life test, while the number of passes to failure for the carbide tool remained nearly at its maximum level. An FE based wear modelling approach is developed to simulate the flank wear evolution of uncoated cemented carbide when transverse machining Alloy 718 in aged condition. In this study, the relation between the volume loss per unit time and the rate of flank wear evolution is established based on Usui’s wear rate equation. The simulation cycle is then presented to integrate 3 D FE simulation of cutting process with the established flank wear rate equation, to predict the wear evolution for predefined simulation cycles. The simulation results showed up to 70 % error in prediction of flank wear evolution. The cause for this deviation and the guidelines for further implementation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, costly {{experimental}} {{procedures have}} been followed in industry to optimise the machining operations {{to secure the}} maximum efficiency in production line, while the functional requirements of the machined surfaces are fulfilled. In recent years, development of robust numerical techniques such as Finite Element Method (FEM) and advances in computing capacity of computers {{have made it possible}} to simulate the machining operations under operational conditions. This has provided a platform to evaluate the responses such as the tool-chip contact stress and temperature for a certain process and to determine the optimum cutting condition by using a considerably smaller number of tool life tests. Nonetheless, the reliability of FE simulation results is shown to largely depend upon implementation of a well-defined material model, which can properly describe the severe material deformation in the vicinity of cutting edge. In the current study a methodology is developed to determine the flow stress properties of the work material together with the optimum frictional condition at the tool-chip interface by means of inverse modelling of orthogonal cutting test. The calibrated constitutive model and the friction coefficients are then used to build three dimensional (3 D) FE models to simulate the cutting process under operational conditions. The FE simulation results are integrated with a limited number of tool life tests to determine the optimum conditions. The viability of the presented methodology is evaluated for finish face milling of the bi-metal aluminium-grey cast iron component-like samples using uncoated cemented carbide tools. This methodology is also adopted for tool flank wear prediction in transverse machining Inconel 718 in aged condition and longitudinal machining 20 MnCrS 5 case hardening steel using uncoated cemented carbide tools. In order to optimise the finish face milling of the bi-metal workpiece, a limited number of tool life tests are initially carried out under controlled conditions to determine the involved wear mechanisms. Investigations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the main wear mechanism constitutes thermal fatigue <b>cracking.</b> Hence, the <b>milling</b> process is simulated under operational conditions and the thermally induced stresses on the cutting edge are calculated for certain combinations of cutting parameters including cutting speed, feed per tooth and depth of cut. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is then adopted to establish the mathematical relation between the cutting parameters and the range of thermally induced stresses on the cutting edge. Subsequently, the optimum cutting condition is determined once the amount of thermally induced stresses on the tool edge and the number of tool engagements per unit length of cut are both minimised. This approach led to 32 % reduction in cycle time compared to a reference tool life test. An FE-based wear modelling approach is developed to predict the flank wear evolution on the uncoated cemented carbide tools in transverse machining Inconel 718 under operational condition. In this approach, initially, the relation between the tool volume loss per unit time and the flank wear evolution rate is established based on the well-known Usui wear model. Once the rate equation was calibrated by the results of the tool life test at a certain cutting condition, it was then possible to integrate it with the FE models to estimate the flank wear evolution for an arbitrary cutting condition. This wear modelling approach is then extended based on the concept of experimental design and RSM to attain a higher accuracy and better computational performance, particularly for the case of 3 D FE modelling of cutting process. The extended methodology is adopted for flank wear estimation in longitudinal turning 20 MnCrS 5 case hardening steel using uncoated cemented carbide tools. The prediction results showed a good agreement with the tool life measurements...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho apresenta os resultados, análises e conclusões de um estudo realizado com objetivo de minimizar o processo de formação e evolução de trincas de origem térmica em insertos de metal duro usados no fresamento frontal. O foco {{principal}} da pesquisa baseou-se na observação de que, por ser um processo de corte interrompido, o fresamento impõe um carregamento térmico cíclico à ferramenta de corte, conduzindo a frequentes variações de tensões nas camadas superficial e sub-superficial de seu gume cortante. Tal característica leva à formação de trincas no substrato, perpendiculares a aresta de corte, as quais auxiliam na aceleração do desgaste e no fim de vida da ferramenta. Muitos trabalhos foram publicados sobre o assunto enfatizando a ciclagem térmica imposta pelo processo de fresamento como {{a principal}} causa da formação das trincas térmicas. Neste caso, o fenômeno surge como conseqüência da diferença de temperatura sofrida pela ferramenta de corte a cada giro da fresa, normalmente definida pela diferença entre as temperaturas no gume cortante imediatamente ao final das fases ativa e inativa (fator &# 61508;T). Assim, propôs-se neste trabalho uma técnica que visa amenizar esta ciclagem térmica característica, por aproximar o fresamento frontal de um processo quase contínuo do ponto de vista térmico. Neste caso, um jato de ar quente foi aplicado na fase inativa da fresa durante todo o processo de usinagem, com objetivo de minimizar o fator &# 61508;T. Esta técnica foi aplicada usando três valores de temperatura do jato de ar, 100, 350 e 580 ºC na condição a seco e 580 °C na condição com fluido de corte aplicado por névoa. Além disso, também foram realizados ensaios a temperatura ambiente. Ao final dos ensaios de fresamento, os insertos foram conduzidos a um microscópio eletrônico de varredura, onde a quantidade de trincas térmicas geradas em cada condição, o desgaste e demais avarias foram analisadas. De maneira geral, observou-se que o aquecimento da fase inativa forneceu resultados positivos na redução da quantidade de trincas térmicas no fresamento frontal com insertos de metal duro. Além disso, a aplicação de fluido de corte por névoa foi eficaz na diminuição do desgaste das ferramentas de corte ensaiadas. This work presents the results, analyses and conclusions about a study {{carried out with}} objective of minimizing the thermal cracks formation on cemented carbide inserts during face milling. The main focus of investigation {{was based on the}} observation that milling process is an interrupted machining process, which imposes cyclic thermal loads to the cutting tool, causing frequent stresses changes in its superficial and sub-superficial layers. These characteristics cause the formation of perpendicular cracks from cutting edge which aid the cutting tool wear, reducing its life. Several works on this subject emphasizing the thermal cyclic behavior imposed by the milling process as the main responsible for thermal cracks formation have been published. In these cases, the phenomenon appears {{as a consequence of the}} difference in temperature experienced by the cutting tool with each rotation of the cutter, usually defined as the difference between the temperatures in the cutting tool wedge at the end of the cutting and idle periods (&# 61508;T factor). Thus, a technique to minimize this cyclic behavior with objective of transforming the milling in an almost-continuous process in terms of temperature was proposed. In this case, a hot air stream was applied into the idle period, during the machining process. This procedure aimed to minimize the &# 61508;T factor. This technique was applied using three values of temperature from the hot air stream (100, 350 e 580 oC) with no cutting fluid (dry condition) and with cutting fluid mist (wet condition) using the hot air stream at 580 oC. Besides, trials at room temperature were carried out. Afterwards the inserts were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope, where the quantity of thermal cracks generated in each condition, the wear and others damages was analyzed. In a general way, it was found that the heating of the idle period was positive for reducing the number of thermal <b>cracks</b> during face <b>milling</b> with cemented carbide inserts. Further, the cutting fluid mist application was effective in reducing the wear of the cutting tools...|$|R
