40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} {{conducted to examine}} the effect of the main parameters influencing the compression stroke of a direct injection Diesel engine. The aim is to develop a methodology that {{can be used as a}} diagnostic tool to determine the compression condition of DI Diesel engines. However, conclusions derived from the present investigation can be extrapolated to other types of reciprocating internal combustion engines. The compression stroke itself is an important index concerning engine operation since engine conditions at the end of the compression stroke have a major effect on its overall performance. Such information is especially important for large scale Diesel engines used for stationary or marine applications. In these engines, it is important to develop non-catastrophic methods for estimating the <b>cylinder</b> <b>compression</b> condition without dismantling the engine cylinder. The outcome could be a serious reduction of maintenance costs, since unnecessary labour required for inspection could be avoided. When using measurement techniques, what is usually available is the cylinder pressure trace during the compression stroke. However, it is widely recognized that the compression stroke and peak compression pressure is strongly affected, beyond heat losses, by the initial pressure at the inlet valve closure, the compression ratio and the blowby rate. The last three parameters can vary significantly during engine operation, while the heat losses vary mainly due to engine operating conditions and their effect on the compression stroke can be considered. Thus, the knowledge of the peak compression pressure resulting from the <b>cylinder</b> <b>compression</b> pressure diagram is not adequate to define the <b>cylinder</b> <b>compression</b> condition. For this reason, an experimental investigation is conducted to {{examine the effect of}} the inital presssure at the inlet valve closure, the compression ratio and the blowby on the cylinder pressure trace. From analysis of the measured data, it is revealed that each parameter has a different effect on the different parts of the compression pressure trace. As revealed, it is possible to determine the compression condition of an engine cylinder based on the measured cylinder pressure trace. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The brake {{efficiency}} of a throttled {{internal combustion engine}} is reduced at low load operation because of the engine work required to drop the intake manifold pressure. These throttling losses are experienced by all throttled engines operating at less than wide open throttle (WOT). By replacing the throttle plate with a suitable air motor, work can be recovered in an expansion process that reduces the induced air pressure to the same intake manifold pressure as the throttled engine. To maximize the benefits from coupling the air motor to the engine cycle, the air {{should be returned to}} a thermal state identical to that of the throttled case at some point prior to combustion. This might be achieved either: (i) prior to <b>cylinder</b> <b>compression</b> via regenerative heat transfer to the inducted air; or (ii) through <b>cylinder</b> <b>compression</b> at an increased compression ratio. The work generated by the Induction Air Motor (IAM) can be directly applied to the engine output thereby increasing the {{brake efficiency}} for the same indicated work. This paper reports on the performance of an IAM designed to reduce intake pressure of an engine for low load operation. Increased brake efficiency will be achieved. The IAM design specifications are explored using a numerical model including isentropic efficiency, friction and service life considerations. A prototype has been constructed and was bench tested at flows and pressures comparable to a throttled engine. These tests indicated that the modelled friction was lower than the friction measured during the experiments. From the experiments performed with the prototype, the net performance of an IAM will give efficiency improvements in excess of 5 % for an equivalent throttled engine operating at loads in the range up to 10 % of its WOT power...|$|R
40|$|The {{compression}} stroke {{is an important}} index for engine operation because in-cylinder conditions {{at the end of}} compression have a major effect on its overall performance and efficiency. It is widely recognized that the {{compression stroke}} is strongly affected, beyond heat losses, by the initial pressure at inlet valve closure, the compression ratio (CR), and the blow-by rate. However, when a compression degradation is detected (i. e. decrease in peak compression pressure), {{it is very difficult to}} directly define the actual cause for this. In the present work, an advanced diagnostic technique is used to estimate the compression condition of a direct injection diesel engine and determine the actual cause for a reduction in peak compression pressure. To validate the proposed technique, a detailed experimental investigation was conducted on a single-cylinder test engine installed in the author's laboratory. At first, measurements were taken during the engine's normal operation (i. e. firing and motoring conditions). Then, 'virtual' faults have been created on the engine (i. e. reduced CR, cylinder mass leakage increase, and inlet chocking), aiming to reduce the peak compression pressure. The diagnostic technique is applied for each test case to estimate the <b>cylinder</b> <b>compression</b> condition and to detect the actual parameter that causes a decrease in peak compression pressure. The diagnosis results reveal that the technique can determine correctly the actual parameter responsible for compression deterioration in each case. This is accomplished even in cases where a combination of faults exists. The results obtained are extremely valuable, because the proposed diagnostic technique can be applied to any type of diesel engine and mainly to large-scale diesel engines (i. e. marine or stationary applications), where the application of non-catastrophic methods (i. e. without modifications or interventions to the engine cylinder) for estimating the <b>cylinder</b> <b>compression</b> conditions is extremely important. © 2010 Authors...|$|R
