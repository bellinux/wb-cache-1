Scholars continue to suggest anti-counterfeit education {{as a means to}} resolve this global problem and curb the demand for <b>counterfeit</b> <b>goods,</b> but no scholarly research has empirically evaluated the effectiveness of anti-counterfeit education. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to draw upon such suggestions within the literature, and quantitatively assess the effectiveness of anti-counterfeit education on consumers' perceived knowledge, attitudes, and purchase intentions of fashion <b>counterfeit</b> <b>goods.</b> 	 Convenience samples of male and female college students participated in this study.

There remains {{a danger of}} buying low-quality and <b>counterfeit</b> <b>goods</b> despite implementing new producing techniques and protective elements. Measures, taken by law enforcement agencies, state authorities and public human rights organizations have not led to systematic suppression of producing and trafficking of such goods. Creation of new information and reference resource, containing information blocks of protective symbols on goods and packages and illustrated materials comprising patterns of discovered <b>counterfeit</b> <b>goods,</b> can assist to increase public awareness and to give necessary information to law enforcement agencies. Organizations, realizing state and social protection of consumers and entrepreneurs, along with producers, rightholders’ representatives and law enforcement bodies can accept the responsibility of creating and functioning this information and reference system in the Internet. Such level of cooperation of all interested organizations will allow to raise efficiency of measures for counteraction to trafficking goods with violated consumer properties.
