40|$|Results {{suggest that}} a linear {{relation}} between <b>cumulative</b> <b>ground</b> heat flux and cumulative skin temperature provides a reasonable representation of soil thaw and is relatively consistent between the two sub-arctic permafrost sites. However, a power equation showed better potential for thaw depth prediction and a better compatibility between sites. The partitioning of the ground heat flux at the two study sites was significantly different due to variations in soil moisture. At the wetter site, a larger fraction of the ground heat flux is partitioned to melt ground ice and warm the soil; whereas the dryer site experienced larger fluxes to the permafrost. Comparison of image analysis and pressure plate extractor test data suggests that 2 D images of soil are a reasonable analogue for the 3 D structure of soil, and that this method provides a fairly accurate approximation for use in characterizing soil and pore structure...|$|R
40|$|Human can be {{distinguished}} by different limb movements and unique <b>ground</b> reaction force. <b>Cumulative</b> foot pressure image is a 2 -D <b>cumulative</b> <b>ground</b> reaction force during one gait cycle. Although it contains pressure spatial distribution information and pressure temporal distribution information, it suffers from several problems including different shoes and noise, when putting it into practice as a new biometric for pedestrian identification. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical translation-invariant representation for cumulative foot pressure images, inspired {{by the success of}} Convolutional deep belief network for digital classification. Key contribution in our approach is discriminative hierarchical sparse coding scheme which helps to learn useful discriminative high-level visual features. Based on the feature representation of cumulative foot pressure images, we develop a pedestrian recognition system which is invariant to three different shoes and slight local shape change. Experiments are conducted on a proposed open dataset that contains more than 2800 cumulative foot pressure images from 118 subjects. Evaluations suggest the effectiveness of the proposed method and the potential of cumulative foot pressure images as a biometric. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
40|$|Estimates {{of water}} flux and storage in organic-covered, {{permafrost}} terrains require {{an understanding of}} the factors controlling soil thaw. Field studies conducted in southern Yukon Territory, Canada, showed that ground freezing and thawing commenced at temperatures between 0. 14 and 0. 24 C. A temperature drop below 0. 6 C had little effect on unfrozen moisture content. Unfrozen moisture storage shifted abruptly between a winter period value of ca. 50 mm and a summer period value of ca. 100 mm, although soil temperatures remained close to the freezing point for extended periods. The organic soil transmitted water laterally early in the thaw period while the water table still remained in the organic soil. Following this period, water movement was mainly vertical, between the ground surface and the underlying mineral sediment. The cumulative energy consumed in melting ice ðQiÞ in the active layer was ca. 76 % of the <b>cumulative</b> <b>ground</b> heat flux, and ca. 15 % of the cumulative net all-wave radiation ðQÞ measured over the snow-free ground surface. A strong linear correlation between Q and Qi, suggests that the degree of soil thaw can be estimated from Q...|$|R
40|$|The {{time series}} of Synthetic Aperture Radar data {{acquired}} by four satellite missions (including ERS, Envisat, TerraSAR-X and Sentinel 1) were processed using Persistent Scatterer interferometric {{synthetic aperture radar}} (InSAR) techniques. The processed datasets provide a nearly continuous coverage from 1992 to 2017 over the Brussels Region (Belgium) and give evidence of ongoing, slow ground deformations. The results highlight an area of uplift located {{in the heart of}} the city, with a <b>cumulative</b> <b>ground</b> displacement of ± 4 cm over a 25 -year period. The rates of uplift appear to have decreased from 2 to 4 mm/year during the ERS acquisition period (1992 – 2006) down to 0. 5 – 1 mm/year for the Sentinel 1 data (2014 – 2017). Uplift of the city centre is attributed to a reduction of groundwater extraction from the deeper (Cenozoic-Paleozoic) aquifers, related to the deindustrialization of the city centre since the 1970 s. The groundwater levels attested by piezometers in these aquifers show a clear recharge trend which induced the uplift. Some areas of subsidence in the river valleys such as the Maelbeek can be related to the natural settlement of soft, young alluvial deposits, possibly increased by the load of buildings...|$|R
40|$|Productivity {{and quality}} of two grazed coastal {{seashore}} meadows in Eastern Uusimaa were examined between May and July, 2002. A total of 18 1 m 2 sample sites divided into four separate cutting regimes were cut by hand to simulate grazing in the meadow. cutting regimes of various intensities were used to simulate the short term effects of different grazing pressures on the quality and productivity of the vascular plant forage in the meadows. Samples were dried, weighed and analysed for digestibility and composition. Digestibility analysis was carried out using in vitro digestibility analysis. A CNS- 1000 Elemental Analyzer {{was used to measure}} carbon, nitrogen and sulphur content of selected samples. The results showed that <b>cumulative</b> above <b>ground</b> phytomass productivity (AGPP) was dependent upon both biotope and cutting regime in the large (40 ha) Bosgård meadow, and that interaction betweeen these two factors was significant. The results of the smaller (< 2 ha) Majvik meadow were highly variable between replicates. This variation overshadowed possible effects of biotope and cutting regime and their interaction. Quality was dependent upon both biotope and cutting regime. D-value decreased over time...|$|R
40|$|Although soil tillage {{has been}} used {{successfully}} to alleviate compaction of forest soil after logging {{in a number of}} management contexts, {{little is known about the}} feasibility of tilling in residual stands. In an attempt to weigh the benefits of tillage against possible damage done to residual trees during tillage, a study was set up to look at both immediate and long-term effects of various treatments in a second-growth Douglas-fir thinning. Designated skid trails were laid out 46 m apart prior to ground-based logging with a rubber-tired skidder and a small crawler iractor. Pre-logging analysis consisted of penetrometer transects used to obtain a general indication of soil strength; during logging, machine movements along trails and turn characteristics were recorded. After logging, four of seven trails were tilled and approximately 40 trees were selected as study trees in each of three populations: (1) trees near untilled trails, (2) trees near tilled trails, and (3) trees away from any trails (control). Bulk density changes were measured in soil near trees in each population using a dual probe nuclear densimeter. In addition, tree and site characteristics, root and stem damage from logging and adjacent competition were recorded for each tree. Untilled irails showed average increases in soil bulk density over control of 17. 8 and 11. 2 percent for 10. 2 - and 20. 3 -cm depths, respectively, but a decrease of 2. 7 percent at the 30. 5 -cm depth. Tilled trail average bulk density showed a difference of 6. 1 percent greater than control at 10. 2 cm and 2. 2 and 3. 6 percent less than control for 20. 3 cm and 30. 5 cm, respectively. Stepwise multiple regression used to explore associations between slope, number of vehicle turns, <b>cumulative</b> <b>ground</b> pressure, slash characteristics on trails, and interactions of all these variables showed no significant associations with bulk density changes due to logging. Analysis of Variance did reveal greater mean bulk densities at the 10. 2 - and 20. 3 -cm depths near trees on untilled Irails where slash did not exist as compared to where slash did exist. Root damage due to tillage was assigned to low, moderate or high damage classes based on length and diameter of roots exposed above ground after tillage. Ana[ysis by regression showed that these root damage classes had significantly different tree diameters, revealing a possible trend of higher root damage for larger trees along trails being tilled. A rough economic ana[ysis estimated tillage for this project cost the Bureau of Land Management approximately 600 /mile or 400 /acre of tilled trail area. These figures are unusually high due to several factors including the small amount of work done for high move-in costs, complications brought on by research demands, and operator inexperience...|$|R
40|$|Nine {{predominantly}} cloud-free NOAA- 7 advanced {{very high}} resolution radiometer images were obtained during a three-month period during the 1981 rainy {{season in the}} Sahel of Senegal.

40|$|Decline in {{crop yields}} {{is a major}} problem facing {{smallholder}} farmers in Kenya and the entire Sub-Saharan region. This is attributed mainly to the mining of major nutrients due to continuous cropping without addition of adequate external nutrients. In most cases inorganic fertilizers are expensive, hence unaffordable to most smallholder farmers. Although organic nutrient sources are available, information about their potential use is scanty. A field experiment was set up in the sub-humid highlands of Kenya to establish the chemical fertilizer equivalency values of different organic materials based on their quality. The experiment consisted of maize plots to which freshly collected leaves of Tithonia diversifolia (tithonia), Senna spectabilis (senna) and Calliandra calothyrsus (calliandra) (all with %N> 3) obtained from hedgerows grown ex situ (biomass transfer) and urea (inorganic nitrogen source) were applied. Results obtained for the <b>cumulative</b> above <b>ground</b> biomass yield for three seasons indicated that a combination of both organic and inorganic nutrient source gave higher maize biomass yield than when each was applied separately. Above ground biomass yield production in maize (t ha? 1) from organic and inorganic fertilization was in the order of senna+urea (31. 2), tithonia+urea (29. 4), calliandra+urea (29. 3), tithonia (28. 6), senna (27. 9), urea (27. 4), calliandra (25. 9), and control (22. 5) for three cumulative seasons. On average, the three organic materials (calliandra, senna and tithonia) gave fertilizer equivalency values for the nitrogen contained in them of 50, 87 and 118 %, respectively. It is therefore recommended that tithonia biomass be used in place of mineral fertilizer as a source of nitrogen. The high equivalency values {{can be attributed to the}} synergetic effects of nutrient supply, and improved moisture and soil physical conditions of the mulch. However, for sustainable agricultural production, combination with mineral fertilizer would be the best option. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} NASA Environmentally Responsible Aircraft project, an ultra high {{bypass ratio}} engine {{integration}} on a hybrid wing body demonstration was planned. The goal was to include engine and airframe integration concepts that reduced fuel consumption by at least 50 % while still reducing noise 42 db <b>cumulative</b> on the <b>ground.</b> Since the engines would be mounted on the upper surface of the aft body of the aircraft, the inlets may be susceptible to vortex ingestion from the wing leading edge at high angles of attack and sideslip, and separated wing/body flow. Consequently, experimental and computational studies were conducted to collect flow surveys useful for characterizing engine operability. The wind tunnel tests were conducted at two NASA facilities, the 14 - by 22 -foot at NASA Langley and the 40 - by 80 -foot at NASA Ames Research Center. The test results included in this paper show that the distortion and pressure recovery levels were acceptable for engine operability. The CFD studies conducted to compare to experimental data showed excellent agreement for the angle of attacks examined, although failed to match the low speed experimental data at high sideslip angles...|$|R
40|$|The first {{continuous}} {{observations of}} ground tilt in Antarctica {{were carried out}} at Syowa Station with a biaxial bubble-type borehole tiltmeter {{and a set of}} water-tube tiltmeter. The former was installed in a waterproof, steel-cased hole 196 cm deep and 144 mm in diameter. The observations began in April 1981. This paper discusses the borehole tiltmeter data from April to December. The signals were recorded on a 12 -channel chart recorder in the data processing hut, 150 m north from the observation hole. The maximum tilt fluctuation during nine months was 17 μrad in the X-component (E-W) and 24 μrad in the Y-component (N-S). As the data seem to be seriously affected by underground temperature variations, the observed data were corrected for temperature assuming a linear relation between the ground tilt and the underground temperature. The corrected records showed a trend of upward tilt on the west and north sides throughout the observation period. The <b>cumulative</b> change of <b>ground</b> tilt during nine months of observation was - 1. 5 μrad in the X-component and 6 μrad in the Y-component. These observations demonstrate that a true ground tilt can be detected by the borehole tiltmeter...|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{wind farm}} (OWF) {{construction}} in the UK is progressing rapidly alongside increasing spatial pressures on marine ecosystems and social and economic activities. A need for increased protection of habitats, species and ecological processes that support environmental and economic benefits is being met by designation of marine protected areas (MPAs). Mitigation and spatial planning solutions are required to enable protection of vital ecological habitats, features and processes and support sustainable economic development. A potential solution is to co-locate OWFs and MPAs. This study uses a multi-disciplinary approach to examine if evidence on the environmental effects of existing OWFs and associated effects on fishing activity (as an existing resource use) benefits MPA goals. Through a systematic review and meta-analyses of existing data, knowledge of OWF effects on species abundance and economic effects on fishing were identified as key evidence gaps. The ecological evidence need was approached through {{a case study of}} ecological effects of North Hoyle OWF, North Wales, UK, using existing pre and post-construction monitoring data, as well as primary baited remote underwater video data, collected 5 years later (8 years post-construction). Results suggested habitat and species recovered to a stable state that showed some community differences to pre-construction conditions. The presence of OWF monopiles is likely to have increased existing heterogeneity of substratum and increased opportunities for scavenging species. Species benefitting and disadvantaged by habitat provided within the OWF reflected meta-analyses trends. Extended baseline monitoring to provide confident identification of natural levels of variation in sediment and fauna was lacking. Analysis of fishing activity and landings before and after OWF construction in three UK case study regions approached effects on resource users. Fishing activity in the three case study areas showed broad scale similarity to national trends. Small-scale activity patterns indicated greater reductions in mobile (towed) fishing gear effort near to operating OWFs than in static gear activity (using pots or static nets). Semi-structured interviews conducted with fishermen in each region revealed loss of ground and disruption as negative effects from OWFs, in addition to existing pressures. Benefits including habitat creation and species augmentation, as well as reduction of <b>cumulative</b> lost <b>ground,</b> were identified by fishermen from co-location of MPAs and OWFs. Ecological effects of OWFs suggested benefits from habitat creation, species augmentation and potential for protection of sandbank habitats between monopiles. Mitigation requirements were identified to maximise these potential benefits to an MPA network. Natural Environment Research Council (NERC...|$|R
30|$|To conclude, {{rigorous}} and empirically well-grounded studies currently {{seem to be}} rare in the research on flipped classrooms. Very few studies can make generalisable or transferrable knowledge claims and thereby {{contribute to the development}} of the field of interest around flipped classrooms. Therefore, it is difficult to identify when, under what circumstances and in what ways the flipped classroom approach might be relevant as a pedagogical choice. For future research, more systematic, both <b>cumulative</b> and empirically <b>grounded</b> knowledge is needed to build a stronger evidence base. Furthermore, a better anchoring in, for example, learning theory or instructional design or in established research methodologies from educational technology research traditions could improve the quality and usefulness of the flipped classroom approach. Our results and recommendations therefore support the conclusions of the earlier review by O’Flaherty et al. (2015) but also foreground the relative impact of the higher education sector, provide more systematic knowledge and offer a problematising stance on the siloed character of the research and its knowledge base. The problem of siloed research and an absence of a shared knowledge base and ‘contribution awareness’ beyond the clusters of educational technology and the STEM areas, for example, are well known within higher education research (Tight, 2014). In the case of higher education, siloed research is characterised by local cases within departments, subject areas, courses, etc. (Tight, 2012). Our results show that the research on flipped classrooms is similarly siloed, suggesting that achieving the goal of improving practice will be difficult if future research does not make explicit connections to earlier studies and results within the overall field of interest.|$|R
