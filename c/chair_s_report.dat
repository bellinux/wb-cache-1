40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{cultural}} underpinnings of accounting practices through a comparative analysis of India and New Zealand, using the chairperson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>report,</b> which is increasingly becoming one of the most important segments of the corporate annual report. Design/methodology/approach – The annual reports of Indian and New Zealand companies from 2001 to 2005 were selected to investigate the extent and nature of information disclosure in their chairperson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>report.</b> “Content analysis” is the main methodological orientation of the paper. Findings – The paper argues that, contrary to propositions based on Hofstede 2 ̆ 7 s cultural framework, Indian companies provide more disclosure in their chairperson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>report</b> than their New Zealand counterparts. This leads to the conclusion that voluntary disclosure, more generally, is a complex phenomenon and cultural variables alone may not be sufficient predictors of the voluntary disclosure practices of a country. Originality/value – Using India and New Zealand, two countries with significant cultural differences, according to Hofstede 2 ̆ 7 s typology, the paper extends the literature by focusing on the chairperson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>report,</b> a more recent accounting phenomenon which is gaining popularity across the globe...|$|R

40|$|Despite growing {{evidence}} suggesting that women engage in verbal and physical dating aggression, there is a dearth of research examining the predictors of women 2 ̆ 7 s engagement in these behaviors. Utilizing a college sample, {{the purpose of the}} current study was to explore women 2 ̆ 7 s perpetration of dating aggression within the context of victimization experiences. Women (N = 374) completed surveys {{at the beginning and end}} of a 10 -week academic quarter for course credit. Results from two retrospective regression analyses (all Time 1 variables) suggested that (1) paternal physical abuse and adolescent/adulthood verbal victimization predicted women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reports</b> of verbal perpetration and (2) childhood sexual abuse, adolescent/adulthood verbal victimization, adolescent/adulthood physical victimization, and adolescent/adulthood verbal perpetration predicted women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reports</b> of physical perpetration. Results from the two prospective, longitudinal regression analyses suggested that (1) verbal perpetration (as measured at Time 1) and verbal victimization over the interim predicted women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reports</b> of verbal perpetration over the interim and (2) physical perpetration (as measured at Time 1), verbal perpetration over the interim, and physical victimization over the interim predicted women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reports</b> of physical perpetration over the interim. These data suggest the importance of considering previous victimization experiences, mutual partner aggression, and a history of aggressive behaviors when examining women 2 ̆ 7 s use of aggression in dating relationships...|$|R
