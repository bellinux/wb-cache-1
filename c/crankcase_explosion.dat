50|$|Sovereign Maersk is {{container}} ship, {{which is}} part of the fleet of Maersk Line. The container vessel is operated by AP Moller Maersk Denmark and built in 1997 in the shipyard of Odense Steel Shipyard. This cargo ship is one of the most discussed ships as a result of a <b>crankcase</b> <b>explosion.</b> On January 20, 2000, whilst sailing from Hong Kong to Long Beach, an oil mist detector alarm sounded. The on duty engineer entered the engine room to investigate. Shortly afterward, a crank case explosion caused by a main engine bearing overheating occurred, causing serious injury to the engineer (who required months of recuperation). The vessel was towed into Kobe, Japan for repairs. The problem with the main engine of Sovereign Maersk was later fixed and in spite of this incident the ship is among the most environmental and most economical ships of Maersk Line built before year 2000.|$|E
5000|$|The {{configuration}} of V-4, V-5, and V-6 resulted from an evolving strategic concept that increasingly emphasized {{the possibility of}} a naval war with Japan in the far western Pacific. This factor, and the implications of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, suggested the need for long-range submarine [...] "cruisers", or [...] "strategic scouts", as well as long-range minelayers, for which long endurance, not high speed, was most important. The design was possibly influenced by the German [...] "U-cruisers" [...] of the Type U-139 and Type U-151 U-boat classes, although V-4, V-5, and V-6 were all larger than these. A raised gun platform was provided around the conning tower, and deck stowage for spare torpedoes was included under the platform and in the superstructure. V-6 and her near-sisters V-4 (...) and V-5 (...) were initially designed with larger and more powerful MAN-designed diesel engines than the Busch-Sulzer engines that propelled earlier V-boats, which were failures. Unfortunately, the specially-built engines failed to produce their design power, and some developed dangerous <b>crankcase</b> <b>explosions.</b> The engineering plant was replaced in 1941-42.|$|R

5000|$|V-4 was {{the first}} of the second {{generation}} of V-boats commissioned in the late 1920s, which remain the largest non-nuclear submarines ever built by the United States. V-4 was the behemoth of its class. These submarines were exempt by special agreement from the armament and tonnage limitations of the Washington Treaty. Her configuration, and that of the following V-5 and V-6, resulted from an evolving strategic concept that increasingly emphasized the possibility of a naval war with Japan in the far western Pacific.

40|$|Oil mist {{detection}} system {{is one of}} commonly used safety aids to monitor and detect engineâ€™s critical conditions in early stages, to protect engines from serious damages and to prevent catastrophic consequence like <b>crankcase</b> <b>explosions.</b> Therefore, this research attempt to assess {{the effectiveness of this}} system to measure if it is serving the aim that it is designed for or not and to assess the effect of the different measuring techniques used on the performance. Moreover, this research investigates whether the effectiveness is positively affecting the market share among other systems, and if the action taken by the system to protect the engines posing no other risks on the ship. A questionnaire based study to investigate the research question is conducted where a sample of 126 ships had participated, the sample included mix of different types of ships with different types of engine sizes and different oil mist detector makers using different measuring technique. Collected data from the sample are analyzed according to quantitative data analysis approaches. The main findings shows that oil mist detector is an effective aid in alerting engine operators about abnormal conditions and therefore i t is used on 94 % of the sample, it is also found that performance of the device is affected by the measuring technique. The research concluded that scatter light technique significantly improved the performance of oil mist detectors. But, linking the system to the engine shut down system pose another risk to the ship operation, therefore, the study proposed a future research on dynamic system for inerting engine crankcase to overcome this risk...|$|R
