Whilst these economic contributions are not disputed by environmental groups, they are not considered as sufficient justification to support further growth in air transport services which would primarily service increased demand for leisure travel rather than a business travel market which is already well served.|$|E
5|$|Other {{plants that}} are {{considered}} to be protocarnivorous have sticky trichomes on some surface, such as the flower scape and bud of Stylidium and Plumbago, the bracts of Passiflora foetida, and leaves of Roridula. The trichomes of Stylidium, which appear below the flower, have been known to trap and kill small insects since their discovery several centuries ago, but their purpose remained ambiguous. In November 2006, Dr. Douglas Darnowski published a paper describing the active digestion of proteins when they come in contact with a trichome of a Stylidium species grown in aseptic tissue culture, proving that the plant, rather than the surface microbes, was the source of protease production. Darnowski asserts in that paper that given this evidence, Stylidium species are properly called carnivorous, though in order to fulfill the strict definition of carnivory it needs to be proven that they are capable of absorbing nutrients derived from prey and that this adaptation gives the plants some <b>competitive</b> <b>advantage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain {{substances}} by governing bodies for the sport, {{from the national}} to the international level. The IAAF's constitution incorporates the World Anti-Doping Code among other anti-doping measures. Practices such as blood doping {{and the use of}} anabolic steroids, peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical <b>competitive</b> <b>advantage</b> in track and field. The use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes' performances, performance-enhancing substances create an uneven playing field — athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes' health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use, and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases, such as Kim Collins' failed drug test due to asthma medication.|$|E

This study is first referring to relevant literatures to identify the measurement indices of supplier capabilities, partnerships and <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages,</b> which are used to collect data through questionnaires. Then, the statistical analyses including factor analysis, Pearson’s correlation, and multiple regression analysis are employed to examine the interrelationships among these factors in deciding how supplier’s capability and partnership affect <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages.</b> According to the results, supplier’s capabilities and partnerships have significantly positive correlation; both supplier’s capabilities and partnerships have positively influence on <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages.</b> In view of the findings, the study concludes that semiconductor industries have to stress on the evaluation of their suppliers’ capabilities, precisely to say, to take account of suppliers’ overall capabilities and resources integration, particularly innovativeness and quality, to enhance partnerships, to build up core competence of supplier chains through technical cooperation and strategic alliance. And all the efforts can help organizations achieve higher <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> and constant growth of operational performance...|$|R
40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} {{step of the}} global apparel value chain (GAVC) the firms face fierce competition due to availability of low cost labor and hence {{the opportunity to make}} higher profit is a tough job. According to Gereffi (1999) a good strategy to overcome this problem is industrial up-gradation through value chain which resembles vertical integration strategy in the study of strategic management. The major theories on strategic management like Porter’s generic competitive strategy, resource based view and capability based view advocates that industrial up-gradation or value chain integration gains <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> for the firms. But no study done on GAVC has neither discussed what should be the relevant <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> for apparel manufacturing firms on the basis of above mentioned theories nor empirically showed how industrial up-gradation can gain <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> and improve firm performances. Therefore, this study has picked up the variables for <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> examining the above mentioned important theories and linked industrial up-gradation and <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> and subsequently with firm performances. This study has done a survey on 180 apparel firms in Bangladesh and by using structural equation modeling it found that industrial up-gradation through value chain has positive influence on <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> and <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> has significant positive influences on firm performances. By analyzing the result, this study recommends the apparel manufacturers in Bangladesh that they should allocate the physical resources and build up human resources {{in such a way that}} in future they can vertically integrate. The firms must not stick to the strategy of reduction of labor cost rather they should also try to pursue for other <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> like time, quality, reliability and flexibility.
