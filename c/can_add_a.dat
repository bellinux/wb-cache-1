25|$|Standard aerogel {{electrodes}} exhibit predominantly double-layer capacitance. Aerogel electrodes {{that incorporate}} composite material <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> high amount of pseudocapacitance.|$|E
25|$|By using TERC, TERT <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> six-nucleotide repeating {{sequence}}, 5'-TTAGGG (in vertebrates, {{the sequence}} differs in other organisms) to the 3' strand of chromosomes. These TTAGGG repeats (with their various protein binding partners) are called telomeres. The template region of TERC is 3'-CAAUCCCAAUC-5'.|$|E

25|$|The {{contemporary}} use of {{the term}} chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to {{the lower part of the}} modal register or normal voice. Within other forms of singing, chest voice is often applied throughout the modal register. Chest timbre <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> wonderful array of sounds to a singer's vocal interpretive palette.|$|E
25|$|If {{the team}} {{not in control}} of the ring commits a penalty, play is not stopped until the penalized team gains control. This is called a delayed penalty. A minor penalty is nullified if a goal is scored during the delay, unless {{penalties}} of equal class were called on both teams. While the penalty is delayed, the attacking team <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> sixth skater to the ice by pulling their goalie. This player can enter the play zone as the fourth attacker.|$|E
25|$|Stamp {{clubs and}} philatelic {{societies}} <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> social aspect to stamp collecting {{and provide a}} forum where novices can meet experienced collectors. Although such organizations are often advertised in stamp magazines and online, the {{relatively small number of}} collectors - especially outside urban areas - means that a club may be difficult to set up and sustain. The Internet partially solves this problem, as the association of collectors online is not limited by geographical distance. For this reason, many highly specific stamp clubs have been established on the Web, with international membership.|$|E
5000|$|Extra 10 seconds: Contestants who {{received}} this [...] "gift" [...] <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>an</b> extra 10 seconds (or, {{in the case}} of a survival game, subtract 10 seconds) to any game, including after a re-attempt following a failure.|$|R
50|$|Boxes <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>an</b> {{additional}} {{layer of}} microclimate insulation and make moving objects easier. Archival boxes are typically made of corrugated, acid-free paper, either buffered or unbuffered, {{or they can}} be made of corrugated polyethylene or polypropylene plastic.|$|R
50|$|The Gmail {{interface}} supports {{drag and}} drop of attachments {{to and from the}} inbox. Users <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>an</b> attachment by dragging it into the mail window. Similarly an attachment can be downloaded by dragging the attachment from the message to the desktop.|$|R
25|$|The {{folded dipole}} is {{therefore}} well matched to 300nbsp&ohm balanced transmission lines, such as twin-feed ribbon cable. The folded dipole has a wider bandwidth {{than a single}} dipole. They {{can be used for}} transforming the value of input impedance of the dipole over a broad range of step-up ratios by changing the thicknesses of the wire conductors for the fed- and folded-sides. Instead of altering thickness or spacing, one <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> third parallel wire to increase the antenna impedance 9nbsp&times over a single-wire dipole, raising the impedance to 450nbsp&ohms, making a good match for window line feed cable, and further broadening the resonant frequency band of the antenna.|$|E
25|$|Generalizing from static {{electricity}} to electromagnetism, {{we have a}} second potential, the magnetic vector potential A, which can also undergo gauge transformations. These transformations may be local. That is, rather than adding a constant onto V, one <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> function that takes on different values {{at different points in}} space and time. If A is also changed in certain corresponding ways, then the same E and B fields result. The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields E and B and the potentials V and A is given in the article Gauge fixing, along with the precise statement {{of the nature of the}} gauge transformation. The relevant point here is that the fields remain the same under the gauge transformation, and therefore Maxwell's equations are still satisfied.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the focused {{crawlers}} are academic crawlers, which crawls free-access academic related documents, such as the citeseerxbot, which is the crawler of CiteSeerX search engine. Other academic search engines are Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search etc. Because most academic papers are published in PDF formats, such kind of crawler is particularly interested in crawling PDF, PostScript files, Microsoft Word including their zipped formats. Because of this, general open source crawlers, such as Heritrix, must be customized to filter out other MIME types, or a middleware is used to extract these documents out and import them to the focused crawl database and repository. Identifying whether these documents are academic or not is challenging and <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> significant overhead to the crawling process, so this is performed as a post crawling process using machine learning or regular expression algorithms. These academic documents are usually obtained from home pages of faculties and students or from publication page of research institutes. Because academic documents takes {{only a small fraction}} in the entire web pages, a good seed selection are important in boosting the efficiencies of these web crawlers. Other academic crawlers may download plain text and HTML files, that contains metadata of academic papers, such as titles, papers, and abstracts. This increases the overall number of papers, but a significant fraction may not provide free PDF downloads.|$|E
30|$|Before the {{algorithm}} <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>an</b> access {{point to the}} set of access points, a set of candidate access points has to be created, 'the pool'. More candidates mostly allow a better access point placement, so a large set will be created (mostly around 100 access points).|$|R
50|$|For an {{additional}} $1 per game, players <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>an</b> EZMatch option. With EZMatch, five additional numbers are randomly assigned. If {{any of the}} EZMatch numbers match any of the regular field numbers chosen by the player, there is an instant payout of an amount varying from $2 to $5,000.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from his}} beatboxing, MC Xander {{is known for}} the range of high vocals he uses in his work; {{particularly}} the high singing in falsetto and whistle register which <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>an</b> 'ethereal' choral quality to his sound. He also uses throat singing techniques to create some of his bass sounds.|$|R
500|$|Another {{element of}} poetic diction {{can be the}} use of vivid imagery for effect. The {{juxtaposition}} of unexpected or impossible images is, for example, a particularly strong element in surrealist poetry and haiku. Vivid images are often endowed with symbolism or metaphor. Many poetic dictions use repetitive phrases for effect, either a short phrase (such as Homer's [...] "rosy-fingered dawn" [...] or [...] "the wine-dark sea") or a longer refrain. Such repetition <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> sombre tone to a poem, or can be laced with irony as {{the context of the}} words changes.|$|E
500|$|The {{giant otter}} is clearly {{distinguished}} from other otters by morphological and behavioural characteristics. It {{has the greatest}} body length of any species in the mustelid family, although the sea otter may be heavier. Males are between [...] in length from head to tail and females between [...] The animal's well-muscled tail <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> further [...] to the total body length. Early reports of skins and living animals suggested exceptionally large males of up to intensive hunting likely reduced the occurrence of such massive specimens. Weights are between [...] for males and [...] for females.|$|E
500|$|Ultimate All-Stars {{has largely}} the same {{features}} as the Wii version of Cross Generation of Heroes, {{with the exception}} of Original Games; instead, it features a top-down shooter minigame set in the Lost Planet world called [...] "Ultimate All-Shooters". Unique to Ultimate All-Stars is Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection support for Vs. Mode competition over the Internet. Online multiplayer matches may be played either with registered friends or opponents, or randomly selected participants. Players can choose from randomly selected opponents to be of a rank similar to their own. Rank is decided by battle points, which fluctuate when a ranked match is won or lost. Once a match is completed, players <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> consenting opponent to a Rival Roster for future matches.|$|E
50|$|So {{while we}} still have a factor of M being multiplied by N, we <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>an</b> {{additional}} count, A, which effectively gives us a divider with a fractional part. Only the prescaler needs to be constructed from high-speed parts, and the reference frequency can remain equal to the desired output frequency spacing.|$|R
50|$|Conserved {{quantities}} are not unique, {{since one}} <b>can</b> always <b>add</b> <b>a</b> constant to a conserved quantity.|$|R
50|$|Another {{dimension}} is {{the addition of}} reverse side effects. The {{opposite side of the}} glass can be prefired with colors, painted with normal oils or acrylics, or gold- or silver-plated. Depending on the opacity level of the font's powders the color or reflection of light from gold leafing <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>an</b> interesting inner glow.|$|R
2500|$|Normally, a link {{will open}} in the current frame or window, but sites that use frames and {{multiple}} windows for navigation <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> special [...] "target" [...] attribute to specify where the link will be loaded. If no window exists with that name, a new window will be created with the ID, {{which can be used}} to refer to the window later in the browsing session.|$|E
2500|$|Outsider Art, on the contrary, {{has been}} {{negatively}} judged {{because of the}} labeling of the artists' work, i.e. the equation artist = genius = insane. Moreover, the business-related issues on the term outsider art carry some misunderstandings. [...] While the outsider artist {{is part of a}} specific art system, which <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> positive value to both the artist's work as well as his personal development, it can also imprison him within the boundaries of the system itself.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{song on the}} album, [...] "Let God Be God", {{was written}} by Dan Dean in {{response}} to global instability. Dean stated that [...] "This is the perfect {{time for us to}} say, Don't panic. God is in control. Jesus asks in Luke 12:25: Who of you by worrying <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> single hour to his life?" [...] One of the edgier songs the band has recorded, the song even has a James Brown scream, which Dean originally recorded to be funny, but it eventually stuck.|$|E

50|$|Files hosted in {{the cloud}} are {{fragmented}} and encrypted before leaving the local machine. They are then distributed randomly using a load balancing and geo-distribution algorithm to other nodes in the cooperative. Users <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>an</b> additional layer of security and reduce storage space by compressing and encrypting files before they are copied to the cloud.|$|R
50|$|Digital audio editors often {{feature the}} ability to {{equalize}} audio samples using standard and custom equalization curves, removing {{the need for a}} dedicated hardware preamplifier when capturing audio with a computer. However, this <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>an</b> extra step in processing a sample, and may amplify audio quality deficiencies of the sound card being used to capture the signal.|$|R
2500|$|The {{pipe organ}} is the {{instrument}} that {{is held in}} high esteem in the Roman Catholic Church for use in its liturgical celebrations. Musicam Sacram, which is a document issued by the Church {{on the use of}} music in the liturgy, states [...] "The pipe organ is to be held in high esteem in the Latin Church, since it is its traditional instrument, the sound of which <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> wonderful splendor to the Church's ceremonies and powerfully lift up men's minds to God and higher things." ...|$|E
2500|$|In unusual situations, {{the minor}} second <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> {{great deal of}} {{character}} to the music. For instance, Frédéric Chopin's Étude Op. 25, No. 5 opens with a melody accompanied by a line that plays fleeting minor seconds. These are used to humorous and whimsical effect, which contrasts with its more lyrical middle section. This eccentric dissonance has earned the piece its nickname: the [...] "wrong note" [...] étude. This kind of usage of the minor second appears in many other works of the Romantic period, such as Modest Mussorgsky's Ballet of the Unhatched Chicks. More recently, the music to the movie Jaws exemplifies the minor second.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the first}} night crews arrive, they are housed indoors in heated dorm rooms at Philmont's Base Camp. [...] Subsequent nights are spent in the Philmont backcountry in tents (or in snow shelters if {{conditions}} permit) often at Miranda or sometimes the Hunting Lodge. [...] After an initial period of training led by trained Kanik guides, several program options are available to each crew depending upon its interest and the weather and snow conditions. [...] Some program options include: cross-country skiing, snow camping, winter ecology, hiking, {{and the use of}} winter tools and equipment. [...] In 2004, a down hill ski package was added to the program options. [...] For an extra fee crews <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> day of down hill skiing/snowboarding to their trek at Angel Fire Ski Resort that includes all meals, housing, a 2-hour ski lesson, lift ticket, and ski equipment rental. [...] This added ski package is not available to crews on the holiday trek.|$|E
