5|$|The {{scene when}} Walter {{approaches}} Gus' house {{with plans to}} kill him ends with an extremely high <b>crane</b> <b>shot</b> of Walter standing alone {{in the middle of}} the street. MacLaren wanted that shot to be extremely effective because she believed it conveyed Walter's helplessness, insignificance and lack of experience. Although the normal crane used for such overhead shots in Breaking Bad was only 30 feet tall, MacLaren rented a 180-foot-tall crane specifically for that shot. Since the crew had only about four hours to shoot before losing the night-time hours, the <b>crane</b> <b>shot</b> was the first one they filmed. It was shot by camera operators Andrew Voegeli, with dolly grip David Jaxx Nagro and gaffer Steven Litecky. Later, for the scene when Walter meets with Mike at a bar, MacLaren backlit Walter as he entered so only his silhouette would be visible when he entered. When the shots of Mike punching Walter was originally filmed, the staging involved Mike standing up, then Walter standing up, then Mike suddenly punching him. Vince Gilligan edited the scene to have Mike simply punch Walter instead to make the action faster and more surprising. The scene was arranged by stunt coordinator Al Goto, and actors Bryan Cranston and Jonathan Banks performed the stunts themselves. Mike kicks Walter several times after he falls, and Goto placed a large sandbag against Cranston's torso for Banks to kick during those scenes.|$|E
25|$|Before he {{directed}} the episode, director Chris Hardwell spent five {{weeks on the}} Numb3rs set watching {{the cast and crew}} film the series. While filming, he gave the writers some insight into his direction. Since series regular Diane Farr was five months pregnant at the time, Hardwell filmed around her belly. He also directed guest star Robin Weigert to act like the perfect housewife in order to disguise the plot twist. Several scenes were shot at Caltech, including one near the Beckham Auditorium and one at an outdoor restaurant. For the final scene, Hardwell used a <b>crane</b> <b>shot</b> on the Numb3rs sound stage.|$|E
25|$|On 3 November, four Israeli warplanes {{attacked}} a British warship, the Black Swan class sloop HMS Crane {{as it was}} patrolling the approaches to the Gulf of Aqaba. According to the IDF, Crane had been identified as an Egyptian warship, and the Israeli General Staff authorized the attack. Three rockets penetrated the ship's hull and caused significant internal damage, including severed power mains and a ruptured oil tank. The ship also sustained some external damage from shrapnel and cannon fire, and three crewmen were wounded. <b>Crane</b> <b>shot</b> down one Israeli plane and damaged another during the engagement.|$|E

50|$|McArdle's visual {{style is}} characterised by distinctive, {{exterior}} locations, long, choreographed tracking and <b>crane</b> <b>shots,</b> low-key lighting and vivid colours. She favours anamorphic lenses and shooting on 35mm film in available light.|$|R
500|$|... "I'll Remember" [...] had {{multiple}} projection screen fills and classic theatre atmospherics (like smoke haze and the flickering light beams from a projection booth) added. The theatre {{walls and ceiling}} had digital enhancements. A sound booth was completely created from scratch to accompany a <b>crane</b> <b>shot</b> down to Madonna. All the movie inserts were treated {{to appear to be}} within the theater and all Madonna's close ups and medium shots were individually treated for facial beauty enhancements.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} for [...] "Milagro" [...] was decidedly low-budget {{due to its}} [...] "intimate and personality-driven" [...] nature. Director Kim Manners sought to film most of the episode [...] "very simply", because he wanted [...] "the characters to carry it". Manners wanted to frame the opening scene {{in a way that}} told [...] "the story [...] in a series of images", and so, he utilized quick cuts between shots. Many of the scenes, such as the opening pan, were created by means of a <b>crane</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E
500|$|Written by George Mastras and {{directed}} by Michelle MacLaren, [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] featured guest appearances by Emily Rios as Andrea, Jim Beaver as black market gun vendor Lawson, and the first appearance by Ray Campbell in the recurring role of Gus' henchman Tyrus Kitt. Due to filming commitments with the television series Supernatural, Beaver had only a half-day to film his scene, which was set on a constructed set resembling a motel room. [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] included several unusual camera angles, including a shot {{from the point of}} view of a Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner, and an extremely high <b>crane</b> <b>shot</b> of Walter from 180-feet in the air.|$|E
50|$|The main set is a four story doll house-like {{interior}} of a mansion turned boarding house with a central courtyard allowing <b>crane</b> <b>shots</b> spanning floors. At $350,000, {{it was the most}} expensive set for a family comedy to date.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "unchained camera technique" [...] ("Entfesselte Kamera" [...] in German) was an {{innovation}} by filmmaker F.W.

5000|$|The film's {{budget was}} low, {{approximately}} $150,000. Bava {{was forced to}} improvise numerous times during the production {{in order to get}} the technical results he wanted. Cameron Mitchell noted that in order to film an impressive dolly shot through the fashion house, Bava simply placed the camera on a child's red wagon. Similarly, Bava completed several <b>crane</b> <b>shots</b> by utilizing a [...] "makeshift seesaw contraption." ...|$|R
500|$|The adaptations {{have had}} an {{influence}} {{on the work of}} the writer Mark Gatiss. Interviewed in 2008, Gatiss said that Lost Hearts is his favourite adaptation because it is the one that frightened him as a child and that [...] "I absolutely love The Treasure of Abbot Thomas. The moment when Michael Bryant has found the treasure and ... is obviously losing his wits. He just says, rationally, 'It is a thing of slime, I think. Darkness and slime ...' There's also the fantastic scene where he thinks he's got away with it by putting the treasure back. The doctor is heading up the drive and he can't quite see him in the sunlight. Then it pauses to that amazing <b>crane</b> <b>shot.</b> ... Very spooky.|$|E
500|$|Visual effects {{supervisor}} Carey Villegas described Peter Berg's photography as [...] "very high energy", {{to which}} the visual effects crew had difficulty adapting. Though the crew had estimated developing 300 visual effects shot at its initial bid, the final tally was approximately 525 shots. An unexpected shot was {{a scene in which}} Hancock shoves a prisoner's head up another's anus, and filmmakers initially attempted to film it conventionally, using sleight of hand techniques with cameras. Finding that doing so did not capture [...] "the vulgarity of the gag", the crew was enlisted to use computer-generated effects. Visual effects were also applied in conjunction with the film's choreography, incorporating palm trees, twisters, and debris in the computer-generated fight scene and combining visual effects with a <b>crane</b> <b>shot</b> to portray Hancock's derailment of a freight train.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} screenplay, Hirani and Joshi stayed {{together}} {{for more than}} four months. They developed scenes by going out for a walk and discussing the scene. They would not return home until they had created a scene that would make them laugh, or cry, or had some provocative thought. While there was a shortage of resources during the shooting of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., the crew did not encounter a financial crisis during the filming of Lage Raho Munna Bhai, as the team managed to receive whatever was deemed necessary (including a Jimmy Jib, a specific kind of camera crane, just for a single <b>crane</b> <b>shot).</b> The film was shot on location in and around Mumbai, with Goa as a backdrop for the [...] "Aane Charaane" [...] song.|$|E
50|$|According to film {{historian}} Ronald Bowers, Litvak became {{skilled in}} using location shooting and realistic documentary effects {{as early as}} the 1930s. He also became known in the industry for emphasizing sound effects over dialogue in sound films as well as preferring to keep the camera running with tracking shots and pans. His preference for achieving motion in camerawork often saw him using <b>crane</b> <b>shots,</b> where he sat up there with the cameraman.|$|R
50|$|To gain unique angles in the series, Rooster Teeth {{first used}} a tank {{in the game}} to emulate <b>crane</b> <b>shots</b> by {{standing}} the cameraman on the turret while it was raised. Later, they found it more practical to stand the cameraman on other characters in the game. This trick has also been used for other purposes, such as standing Donut on two characters {{to create the illusion}} that he could jump higher than is possible in the game.|$|R
5000|$|For the {{courtroom}} sequence, Hitchcock used {{a new technique}} by utilizing four cameras shooting simultaneously, each focused {{on one of the}} principal actors in the scene [...] - [...] multiple camera photography had been used in the past, but only to shoot the same subject. This set-up, including elaborately choreographed <b>crane</b> <b>shots,</b> allowed Hitchcock to shoot long 10-minute takes, something he would push to the limit on his next two films, Rope (1948) and Under Capricorn (1949).|$|R
500|$|Hooper {{directed}} several EastEnders episodes between 1998 and 2000, two {{of which}} were hour-long specials that represented the soap when it won the British Academy Television Award for Best Soap Opera in 2000 and 2001; {{the first was the}} episode in which Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) learns her daughter Bianca (Patsy Palmer) had an affair with her fiancé Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). The Jackson episode marked the beginning of a week of episodes that lead to Palmer's departure from the soap, and Robinson had hired Hooper to direct the key episodes of that storyline. Hooper worked 10-hour days on EastEnders, and learned to direct with speed. He was influenced in his early career by the cinematic style of American TV series such as ER, NYPD Blue and [...] and tried to work that style into his EastEnders episodes; one scene featuring Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) involved a <b>crane</b> <b>shot,</b> which Hooper believes made him infamous among the EastEnders production crew.|$|E
500|$|There {{were some}} improvised scenes. These {{included}} {{a scene in}} the beginning of the episode where Alan and Joanna are in a middle of a field and the scene begins with a low-angle shot. Later, when Alan is [...] "humping" [...] Joanna, the scene suddenly becomes a <b>crane</b> <b>shot.</b> This is because the crew at the time had a crane camera after they had finished filming the final scenes in series 2 where Alan, Joanna and Martin are teetering over the edge of a cliff in the stolen camper van. The camper van scenes were the hardest to shoot, especially the scene where the van explodes, as this had to be done in one take. Another problem was the smell of the van, which Pippa Haywood said, [...] "smelt of old dogs." [...] The van also suffered other problems such as bits of the steering wheel and gear stick coming off. Julian Rhind-Tutt commented that the scene where Alan and Boyce talk together for the last time was one of the most moving scenes in the whole of Green Wing. The wedding was shot at Hall of Bayham Abbey in Kent, where the crew had difficulty filming due to bad weather. The show also features a guest appearance from Jeremy Sheffield near the end of the episode as Sue's new boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|Charness {{singled out}} the film's famous title number and states, [...] "it's a very kinetic moment, for {{though there is}} no {{technically}} accomplished dance present, the feeling of swinging around in a circle with an open umbrella is a brilliantly apt choice of movement, one that will be readily identifiable by an audience which might know nothing kinesthetically of actual dance... Accompanying this movement is a breathless pullback into a high <b>crane</b> <b>shot</b> that takes {{place at the same time}} Kelly is swinging into his widest arcs with the umbrella. The effect is dizzying. Perhaps the finest single example of the application of camera knowhow to a dance moment in Donen-Kelly canon." [...] He also complimented Donen's direction in the [...] "Moses Supposes" [...] number, including [...] "certain camera techniques which Donen had by now formularized... the dolly shot into medium shot to signify the ending of one shot and the beginning of another." [...] Although Donen credits earlier musicals by René Clair, Lubitsch and Astaire as [...] "integrated", he also states that [...] "in the early musicals of Lubitsch and Clair, they made it clear from the beginning that their characters were going to sing operatically. Gene and I didn't go that far. In 'Moses Supposes', he and Donald sort of talk themselves into a song." [...] Donen's Royal Wedding and Give A Girl A Break continued to use special effect shots to create elaborate dance sequences, and Kelly used even more sophisticated animation in his film Invitation to Dance.|$|E
5000|$|He {{introduced}} to Hollywood a unique visual style using artistic lighting, extensive and fluid camera movement, high <b>crane</b> <b>shots,</b> and unusual camera angles. He was versatile and could handle {{any kind of}} picture: melodrama, comedy, love story, film noir, musical, war story, Western, or historical epic. He always {{paid attention to the}} human interest aspect of every story, stating that the [...] "human and fundamental problems of real people" [...] were the basis of all good drama.|$|R
50|$|Although Reznor {{originally}} hired a filming company, {{he changed}} his mind based on cost and his experience from The Downward Spiral tour, wanting to capture the shows from a more realistic point of view. This decision allowed the crew to review the shots each night on the tour bus so they could tell what to focus on during the next show. As a result, the video is dark and smoky rather than polished, the cameras are sometimes shaky and there are no sweeping <b>crane</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Burks' voyeuristic camera {{movement}} in the film was more radical than anything he had done previously, alternating between [...] "tightly framed compositions shot with 50mm fixed lenses and striking camera moves, including backward and forward zooms, elaborate tracking <b>shots</b> pans, <b>crane</b> <b>shots,</b> Dutch tiles, and even the combination zoom and dolly shot." [...] These decisions were not superfluous though; despite their extreme nature, the camera {{movement in}} the film was highly calculated and fluid, ultimately reflecting a [...] "highly effective synthesis of narrative development and artistic expression." ...|$|R
500|$|Several {{scenes in}} Inside Man {{required}} multiple-camera setups, {{which meant that}} Libatique had to instruct and work with multiple camera operators. Lee {{wanted to create a}} visual distinction between the characters Russell (Owen) and Frazier (Washington), while incorporating visual metaphors. Russell's scenes, in which he masterminds the bank heist, were shot with a Steadicam to suggest that the character is in control. Frazier's scenes, in which he is tasked with handling the hostage situation, were filmed with multiple hand-held cameras to display the character's confusion. Libatique explained, [...] "I said, 'We want {{to create a sense of}} control and largely centered frames with Clive’s character, and we want to have movement with Denzel’s.' Having three operators on the same character, I’d watch all three. In a handheld shot, a long lens has a little bit of movement and a wider lens is inherently smoother. I would actually talk to the operator and tell him not to be so steady. It was the first time I’d worked with so many operators where I wasn’t one myself." [...] Telephone conversations between Russell and Frazier were shot using two cameras simultaneously filming the actors performing on two different sets of a soundstage at Steiner Studios. [...] Steadicam operator Stephen Consentino estimated that 80% of the film was shot with hand-held cameras or a Steadicam. A total of seven cameras were used to film the scene where the hostages are finally released. A Technocrane was used for a <b>crane</b> <b>shot</b> that would cover the following moment, in which the hostages are placed in buses.|$|E
500|$|Gracey {{refers to}} the film's {{cinematography}} as [...] "nothing short of astounding", and cites a particular example as highlighting Argento's [...] "passion for technical prowess and breathtaking visuals". Influenced by the penultimate shot in Antonioni's The Passenger (1975), on which Tovoli had also been the cinematographer, one of Tenebraes main setpieces is {{the murder of the}} lesbian couple. To introduce the scene, Argento and Tovoli employed the use of a Louma crane to film a several minutes-long tracking shot. Owing to its extreme length, the tracking shot ended up being the most difficult and complex part of the production to complete. It required a maze of scaffolding to be built around the outside of the home. Argento captured all the footage he needed in two takes, but insisted on filming ten more. The scene, which lasts for two-and-a-half minutes on-screen, took three days to shoot. It marked the first time the Louma crane had been used in an Italian production; the crane itself had to be imported from France. According to Gracey, the camera performs [...] "aerial gymnastics", scaling the victims' house in [...] "one seamless take, navigating walls, roofs, and peering in through windows, in a set piece that effortlessly exposes the penetrability of a seemingly secure home". Newman and Jones said that although this type of <b>crane</b> <b>shot</b> became commonplace later, {{at the time it was}} [...] "truly ground-breaking" [...] in the way the camera seemingly crawled over the walls and up the building – not quite from the killer's viewpoint. Patrick McAllister of Scifilm said the sequence should be considered [...] "one of the most memorable moments in cinema". According to McAllister, Tenebraes distributor begged Argento to cut the shot down because it was [...] "meaningless". Newman and Jones agreed that the shot added nothing to the film's plot, but called it [...] "meaninglessly brilliant".|$|E
2500|$|Actress Catherine Deneuve has {{provided}} another anecdote illustrating {{this aspect of}} Buñuel's style: while shooting Tristana, {{he had told her}} frequently of the distaste he felt for the [...] "touristy" [...] side of Toledo, where the film was made, so she teased him about one <b>crane</b> <b>shot</b> that brought out the beauty of the surrounding landscape, to which Buñuel responded by re-shooting the entire scene from a dolly with no background whatsoever, all the while inveighing against the [...] "obviously" [...] beautiful.|$|E
5000|$|Sidney Rosenzweig {{argues that}} Curtiz did {{have his own}} {{distinctive}} style, which was {{in place by the}} time of his move to America: [...] "high <b>crane</b> <b>shots</b> to establish a story's environment; unusual camera angles and complex compositions in which characters are often framed by physical objects; much camera movement; subjective shots, in which the camera becomes the character's eye; and high contrast lighting with pools of shadows". Aljean Harmetz states that, [...] "Curtiz's vision of any movie... was almost totally a visual one".|$|R
5|$|After the {{location}} filming, production {{went back to}} soundstages for interiors. Some scenes were shot against a green screen background for second unit footage of other locations to be substituted, allowing the use of <b>crane</b> <b>shots.</b> With the photography done, Moore took the film to South Korea to edit to prevent Disney from finding out; he also refused to tell most of his close friends what he was doing.

5000|$|The {{television}} comedy Second City Television (SCTV) {{uses the}} concept of the <b>crane</b> <b>shot</b> as comedic material. After using a <b>crane</b> <b>shot</b> in one of the first NBC-produced episodes, the network complained about the exorbitant cost of renting the crane. SCTV writers responded by making the [...] "crane shot" [...] a ubiquitous symbol of production excess while also lampooning network executives who care nothing about artistic vision and everything about the bottom line.
