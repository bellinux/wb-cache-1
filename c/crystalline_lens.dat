25|$|Water has {{a higher}} {{refractive}} index than air – {{similar to that of}} the cornea of the eye. Light entering the cornea from water is hardly refracted at all, leaving only the eye's <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens</b> to focus light. This leads to very severe hypermetropia. People with severe myopia, therefore, can see better underwater without a mask than normal-sighted people.|$|E
25|$|Light rays bend {{when they}} travel from one medium to another; the amount of bending is {{determined}} by the refractive indices of the two media. If one medium has a particular curved shape, it functions as a lens. The cornea, humours, and <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens</b> of the eye together form a lens that focuses images on the retina. Our eyes are adapted for viewing in air. Water, however, has approximately the same refractive index as the cornea (both about 1.33), so immersion effectively eliminates the cornea's focusing properties. When our eyes are in water, instead of focusing images on the retina, they now focus them far behind the retina, resulting in an extremely blurred image from hypermetropia.|$|E
25|$|Belugas {{are able}} to see within and outside of water, but their vision is {{relatively}} poor when compared to dolphins. Their eyes are especially adapted to seeing under water, although when they {{come into contact with}} the air, the <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens</b> and the cornea adjust to overcome the associated myopia (the range of vision under water is short). A beluga's retina has cones and rods, which also suggests they can see in low light. The presence of cone cells indicates they can see colours, although this suggestion has not been confirmed. Glands located in the medial corner of their eyes secrete an oily, gelatinous substance that lubricates the eye and helps flush out foreign bodies. This substance forms a film that protects the cornea and the conjunctiva from pathogenic organisms.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{demonstrate}} and evaluate the use of digital-image photography to measure the central thickness and equatorial diameter of whole fresh human <b>crystalline</b> <b>lenses</b> free of all zonular attachments. Forty-one human donor postmortem intact clear <b>crystalline</b> <b>lenses,</b> with a mean age of 28. 5 ± 16. 4 years, were obtained by the contributing eye banks. The lenses were removed by the eye bank and shipped in Optisol-GS, a physiologic preservative storage medium, at 7 °C. The lenses were stored at the same temperature and in the same preservative throughout this study. This medium has been demonstrated to maintain the morphometric characteristics of epithelial cells. After freeing the lenses of all residual zonular attachments, digital photographs were obtained within an average of 20. 9 ± 13. 4 h after death. The digital images were used to determine the central thickness and equatorial diameter of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>lenses.</b> By carefully calibrating the digital images and maintaining the lenses in physiological storage medium, reliable dimensional measurements were obtained.

25|$|Toxic {{substances}} and poisons (like atropine) can {{significantly reduce the}} range of aperture. Pharmaceutical products such as eye drops may also cause similar side-effects. Tropicamide and phenylephrine are used in medicine as mydriatics to dilate pupils for retinal and lens examination. These medications take effect in about 30–45 minutes after instillation and last for about 8 hours. Atropine is also used {{in such a way}} but its effects can last up to 2 weeks, along with the mydriatic effect; it produces cycloplegia (a condition in which the <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens</b> of the eye cannot accommodate to focus near objects). This effect goes away after 8 hours. Other medications offer the contrary effect. Pilocarpine is a miotic (induces miosis); it can make a pupil as small as 1mm in diameter depending on the person and their ocular characteristics. Such drops are used in certain glaucoma patients to prevent acute glaucoma attacks.|$|E
500|$|Accommodation is {{the process}} by which the eye {{increases}} optical power to maintain focus on the retina while shifting its gaze to a closer point. The long-standing medical consensus is that this is accomplished by action of the ciliary muscle, a muscle within the eye, which adjusts the curvature of the eye's <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens.</b> This explanation is based in the observed effect of atropine temporarily preventing accommodation when applied to the ciliary muscle, as well as images reflected on the <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens</b> becoming smaller as the eye shifts focus to a closer point, indicating a change in the lens' shape. Bates rejected this explanation, and in his 1920 book presented photographs that he said showed that the image remained the same size even as the eye shifted focus, concluding from this that the lens was not a factor in accommodation. However, optometrist Philip Pollack in a 1956 work characterized these photographs as [...] "so blurred {{that it is impossible to}} tell whether one image is larger than the other", in contrast to later photographs that clearly showed a change in the size of the reflected images, just as had been observed since the late nineteenth century.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To review our {{experience}} with combined pars plana lensectomy-vitrectomy and open-loop flexible anterior chamber intraocular lens (AC IOL) implantation for managing subluxated <b>crystalline</b> <b>lenses.</b> METHODS: Retrospective review of 36 consecutive eyes (28 patients), {{all of which}} had subluxated <b>crystalline</b> <b>lenses,</b> managed by pars plana lensectomy-vitrectomy with insertion of an open-loop flexible AC IOL. The study was performed at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, over an 8 -year period. RESULTS: An average preoperative visual acuity of 20 / 163 (range, 20 / 25 to hand motions) improved to 20 / 36 (range, 20 / 20 to 4 / 200) with surgery after a mean follow-up of 14 months (range, 1 to 59 months) (P <. 001, Student's paired t test). Final visual acuity of 20 / 40 or better was achieved in 75 % of eyes (27 / 36). Complications included cystoid macular edema (8 % [3 / 36]), pupillary block (6 % [2 / 36]), retinal detachment (3 % [1 / 36]), hyphema (3 % [1 / 36]), wound leak (3 % [1 / 36]), and transient vitreous hemorrhage (3 % [1 / 36]). No persistent ocular hypertension was seen, nor did angle abnormalities or corneal decompensation develop. CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana lensectomy-vitrectomy with AC IOL implantation {{appears to be an}} excellent technique for managing subluxated <b>crystalline</b> <b>lenses.</b> It is associated with a significant improvement in visual acuity (P <. 001) and avoids many of the complications seen with extraction of a subluxated lens through a limbal wound.

Also, few people have eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one may need a [...] "stronger", (i.e. more [...] refracting), lens than the other. A common condition in people over forty years old is presbyopia, which {{is caused by the}} eye's <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens</b> losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to accommodate (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye).

RESULTS: Axial length in present study was significantly less in angle closure suspects (22. 41 ± 0. 52) as compared to open angles (23. 23 ± 0. 51) (P< 0. 001). Thickness of lens in angle closure suspects (4. 44 ± 0. 9) was significantly more as compared to open angles(4. 28 ± 0. 28) (P< 0. 001). Anterior chamber depth was significantly low in angle closure suspects (2. 59 ± 0. 9) as compared to open angles (3. 19 ± 0. 9) (P< 0. 001).

60|$|Section 111. The eye (Figure 8) has a tough, dense, outer coat, the {{sclerotic}} (sc.), {{within which}} is a highly vascular and internally pigmented layer, the choroid, upon which the percipient nervous layer, the retina (r.) rests. The chief chamber of the eye is filled with a transparent jelly, the vitreous humour (v.h.). In front of the eye, the white sclerotic passes into the transparent cornea (c.). The epidermis is continued over the outer face {{of this as a}} thin, transparent epithelium. The choroid coat is continued in front by a ring-shaped muscle, the iris (ir.) the coloured portion of the eyes. This iris enlarges or contracts its central aperture (the black pupil) by reflex action, as the amount of light diminishes or increases. Immediately behind this curtain is the <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens</b> (l.), the curvature of the anterior face or which is controlled by the ciliary muscle (c.m.). In front of the lens is the aqueous humour (a.h.). The description of the action of this apparatus involves the explanation of several of the elementary principles of optics, and will be found by the student in any text-book of that subject. Here it would have no very instructive bearing, either on general physiological considerations or upon anatomical fact.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} {{cases are}} taken from an able paper by Mr. W. Sedgwick, and from Dr. Prosper Lucas. (12/19. 'British and Foreign Medico-Chirurg. Review' April 1861 pages 482-6; 'L'Hered. Nat.' tome 1 pages 391-408.) Amaurosis, either congenital or coming on late in life, and causing total blindness, is often inherited; {{it has been observed}} in three successive generations. Congenital absence of the iris has likewise been transmitted for three generations, a cleft-iris for four generations, being limited in this latter case to the males of the family. Opacity of the cornea and congenital smallness of the eyes have been inherited. Portal records a curious case, in which a father and two sons were rendered blind, whenever the head was bent downwards, apparently owing to the <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens,</b> with its capsule, slipping through an unusually large pupil into the anterior chamber of the eye. Day-blindness, or imperfect vision under a bright light, is inherited, as is night-blindness, or an incapacity to see except under a strong light: a case has been recorded, by M. Cunier, of this latter defect having affected eighty-five members of the same family during six generations. The singular incapacity of distinguishing colours, which has been called DALTONISM, is notoriously hereditary, and has been traced through five generations, in which it was confined to the female sex.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeDifferent {{subspecies}} of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) {{that are}} derived from different geographical locations, primarily Indian and China, are commonly employed in vision research. Substantial morphological and behavioral differences have been reported between Chinese- and Indian-derived subspecies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare refractive development in Chinese- and Indian-derived rhesus monkeys. MethodsThe subjects were 216 Indian-derived and 78 Chinese-derived normal infant rhesus monkeys. Cross-sectional data were obtained at 3 weeks of age for all subjects. In addition, longitudinal data were obtained from 10 Indian-derived (male= 5, female= 5) and 5 Chinese-derived monkeys (male= 3, female= 2) that were reared with unrestricted vision. Ocular and refractive development was assessed by retinoscopy, keratometry, video-based ophthalmophakometry, and A-scan ultrasonography. ResultsAlthough the course of emmetropization was very similar in these two groups of rhesus monkeys, there were consistent and significant inter-group differences in ocular dimensions and refractive error. Throughout the observation period, the Chinese-derived monkeys were on average about 0. 4 D less hyperopic than the Indian-derived monkeys and the Chinese-derived monkeys had longer overall axial lengths, deeper anterior and vitreous chamber depths, thicker <b>crystalline</b> <b>lenses,</b> flatter corneas and lower powered <b>crystalline</b> <b>lenses.</b> ConclusionsThe ocular differences observed in this study presumably reflect genetic differences between subspecies but could reflect the differences in the genetic pool between isolated colonies rather than true subspecies differences. Nonetheless, the substantial ocular differences that we observed emphasize that caution must be exercised when comparing and/or pooling data from rhesus monkeys obtained from different colonies. These inter-subspecies differences might be analogous to the ethnic differences in ocular parameters that have been observed in humans...|$|R
40|$|Uveal {{melanoma}} is {{the most}} common malignancy of the adult eye. Although it is a relatively infrequent tumor, clinical prognosis is often poor owing to a high incidence of aggressive metastatic disease, for which there are limited treatment options. Little is known about the etiology of this condition, although several risk factors have been identified. Unlike cutaneous melanoma, however, ultraviolet radiation does not figure prominently among these risk factors. In this review, we focus on an associated form of visible electromagnetic radiation, high-energy short-wave (blue) light, a causative agent in various forms of age-related retina damage, as a previously overlooked risk factor in uveal melanoma development and progression. Finally, we discuss the impact of these data on contemporary ocular therapy, particularly the debate surrounding the filtering capabilities of intraocular lenses used to replace dysfunctional <b>crystalline</b> <b>lenses</b> during cataract surgery...|$|R

There were statistically {{significant differences in the}} {{optical properties}} of the lenses between the first three groups and between the predatory species.

6000|$|Less startling perhaps, {{though still}} startling enough, {{is the fact}} that the eye is evolved out of a portion of the skin; and that while the <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens</b> and its {{surroundings}} thus originate, the [...] "percipient portions of the organs of special sense, especially of optic organs, are often formed from the same part of the primitive epidermis" [...] which forms the central nervous system.[59] Similarly is it with the organs for smelling and hearing. These, too, begin as sacs formed by infoldings of the epidermis; and while their parts are developing they are joined from within by nervous structures which were themselves epidermic in origin. How are we to interpret these strange transformations? Observing, as we pass, how absurd from the point of view of the special-creationist, would appear such a filiation of structures, and such a round-about mode of embryonic development, we have here to remark that the process is not one to have been anticipated as a result of natural selection. After numbers of spontaneous variations had occurred, as the hypothesis implies, in useless ways, the variation which primarily initiated a nervous centre might reasonably have been expected to occur in some internal part where it would be fitly located. Its initiation in a dangerous place and subsequent migration to a safe place, would be incomprehensible. Not so if we bear in mind the cardinal truth above set forth, that the structures for holding converse with the medium and its contents, arise in that completely superficial part which is directly affected by the medium and its contents; and if we draw the inference that the external actions themselves initiate the structures. These once commenced, and furthered by natural selection where favourable to life, would form the first term of a series ending in developed sense organs and a developed nervous system.[60] ...|$|E
60|$|The {{luminous}} organs which {{occur in}} a few insects, belonging to widely different families, and which are situated {{in different parts of}} the body, offer, under our present state of ignorance, a difficulty almost exactly parallel with that of the electric organs. Other similar cases could be given; for instance in plants, the very curious contrivance of a mass of pollen-grains, borne on a foot-stalk with an adhesive gland, is apparently the same in Orchis and Asclepias, genera almost as remote as is possible among flowering plants; but here again the parts are not homologous. In all cases of beings, far removed from each other in the scale of organisation, which are furnished with similar and peculiar organs, it will be found that although the general appearance and function of the organs may be the same, yet fundamental differences between them can always be detected. For instance, the eyes of Cephalopods or cuttle-fish and of vertebrate animals appear wonderfully alike; and in such widely sundered groups no part of this resemblance can be due to inheritance from a common progenitor. Mr. Mivart has advanced this case as one of special difficulty, but I am unable to see the force of his argument. An organ for vision must be formed of transparent tissue, and must include some sort of lens for throwing an image at the back of a darkened chamber. Beyond this superficial resemblance, there is hardly any real similarity between the eyes of cuttle-fish and vertebrates, as may be seen by consulting Hensen's admirable memoir on these organs in the Cephalopoda. It is impossible for me here to enter on details, but I may specify a few of the points of difference. The <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens</b> in the higher cuttle-fish consists of two parts, placed one behind the other like two lenses, both having a very different structure and disposition to what occurs in the vertebrata. The retina is wholly different, with an actual inversion of the elemental parts, and with a large nervous ganglion included within the membranes of the eye. The relations of the muscles are as different as it is possible to conceive, and so in other points. Hence it is not a little difficult to decide how far even the same terms ought to be employed in describing the eyes of the Cephalopoda and Vertebrata. It is, of course, open to any one to deny that the eye in either case could have been developed through the natural selection of successive slight variations; but if this be admitted in the one case it is clearly possible in the other; and fundamental differences of structure in the visual organs of two groups might have been anticipated, in accordance with this view of their manner of formation. As two men have sometimes independently hit on the same invention, so in the several foregoing cases it appears that natural selection, working for the good of each being, and taking advantage of all favourable variations, has produced similar organs, as far as function is concerned, in distinct organic beings, which owe none of their structure in common to inheritance from a common progenitor.|$|E
6000|$|With {{respect to}} the eye itself, the highest {{authority}} in England, Mr. Bowman, has been so kind as {{to give me the}} following remarks on certain inherited imperfections. First, hypermetropia, or morbidly long sight: in this affection, the organ, instead of being spherical, is too flat from front to back, and is often altogether too small, so that the retina is brought too forward for the focus of the humours; consequently a convex glass is required for clear vision of near objects, and frequently even of distant ones. This state occurs congenitally, or at a very early age, often in several children of the same family, where one of the parents has presented it. (12/16. This affection, as I hear from Mr. Bowman, has been ably described and spoken of as hereditary by Dr. Donders of Utrecht, whose work was published in English by the Sydenham Society in 1864.) Secondly, myopia, or short-sight, in which the eye is egg-shaped and too long from front to back; the retina in this case lies behind the focus, and is therefore fitted to see distinctly only very near objects. This condition is not commonly congenital, but comes on in youth, the liability to it being well known to be transmissible from parent to child. The change from the spherical to the ovoidal shape seems the immediate consequence of something like inflammation of the coats, under which they yield, and there is ground for believing that it may often originate in causes acting on the individual affected (12/17. M. Giraud-Teulon has recently collected abundant statistical evidence, 'Revue des Cours Scientifiques' September 1870 page 625, showing that short sight is due to the habit of viewing objects from a short distance, c'est le travail assidu, de pres.) and may thenceforward become transmissible. When both parents are myopic Mr. Bowman has observed the hereditary tendency in this direction to be heightened, and some of the children to be myopic at an earlier age or in a higher degree than their parents. Thirdly, squinting is a familiar example of hereditary transmission: it is frequently a result of such optical defects as have been above mentioned; but the more primary and uncomplicated forms of it are also sometimes in a marked degree transmitted in a family. Fourthly, CATARACT, or opacity of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens,</b> is commonly observed in persons whose parents have been similarly affected, and often at an earlier age in the children than in the parents. Occasionally more than one child in a family is thus afflicted, one of whose parents or other relations, presents the senile form of the complaint. When cataract affects several members of a family in the same generation, it is often seen to commence at about the same age in each: e.g., in one family several infants or young persons may suffer from it; in another, several persons of middle age. Mr. Bowman also informs me that he has occasionally seen, in several members of the same family, various defects in either the right or left eye; and Mr. White Cooper has often seen peculiarities of vision confined to one eye reappearing in the same eye in the offspring. (12/18. Quoted by Mr. Herbert Spencer 'Principles of Biology' volume 1 page 244.) ...|$|E

We found the first fish lenses that are free of measurable longitudinal spherical aberration, i. e., are perfectly monofocal, in contrast to the multifocal lenses that are typical for smaller fishes living close to the surface. In fact, none of the lenses investigated in this study were clearly multifocal. Most, but not all, of the lenses had long normalized focal lengths (focal length/lens radius) of up to 3. 3 lens radii. A monofocal lens of long focal length, combined with spectrally suitably placed cone pigments, may be the optimal solution for vision of high spatial and spectral resolutions in a habitat where the available spectrum of light is limited...|$|R

Protestants are so bigoted [...] . but if, after seeing me for a month or two the same Luke that he had ever known me, he were gradually informed that I had all the while held that creed which he had considered incompatible with such a life as I hope mine would be--you must see the effect which it ought to have. [...] . I don't doubt that you will complain of all this. [...] . All I can say is, that I cannot sympathise with that superstitious reverence for mere verbal truth, which is so common among Protestants. [...] . It seems to me they throw away the spirit of truth, in their idolatry of its letter. For instance,--what is the use of informing a man of a true fact but to induce a true opinion in him? But if, by clinging to the exact letter of the fact, you create a false opinion in his mind, as I should do in my father's case, if by telling him at once of my change, I gave him an unjust horror of Catholicism,--you do not tell him the truth. [...] . You may speak what is true to you,-- but it becomes an error when received into his mind. [...] . If his mind is a refracting and polarising medium--if the <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens</b> of his soul's eye has been changed into tourmaline or Labrador spar- -the only way to give him a true image of the fact, is to present it to him already properly altered in form, and adapted to suit the obliquity of his vision; in order that the very refractive power of his faculties may, instead of distorting it, correct it, and make it straight for him; and so a verbal wrong in fact may possess him with a right opinion.

60|$|The intropulsive force, {{that sends}} the {{ossification}} inward {{as to the}} centre, is reserved for a yet higher step, and this we find embodied {{in the class of}} fishes. Even here, however, the process still seems imperfect, and (as it were) initiatory. The skeleton has left the surface, indeed, but the bones approach to the nature of gristle. To feel the truth of this, we need only compare the most perfect bone of a fish with the thigh-bones of the mammalia, and the distinctness with which the latter manifest the co-presence of the magnetic power in its solid parietes, of the electrical in its branching arteries, and of the third greatest power, viz., the qualitative and interior, in its marrow. The senses of fish are more distinct than those of insects. Thus, the intensity of its sense of smell has been placed beyond doubt, and rises in the extent of its sphere far beyond the irritable sense, or the feeling, in insects. I say the feeling, not the touch; for the touch seems, as it were, a supervention to the feeling, a perfection given to it by the reaction of the higher powers. As the feeling of the insect, in subtlety and virtual distance, rises above the solitary sense of taste(16) in the mollusca, so does the smell of the fish rise above the feeling of the insect. In the fish, likewise, the eyes are single and moveable, while it is remarkable that the only insect that possesses this latter privilege, is an inhabitant of the waters. Finally, here first, unequivocally, and on a large scale, (for I pretend not to control the freedom, in which the necessity of Nature is rooted, by the precise limits of a system,)—here first, Nature exhibits, in the power of sensibility, the consummation of those vital forms (the nisus formativi) the adequate and the sole measure of which is to be sought for in their several organic products. But as if a weakness of exhaustion had attended this advance in the same moment it was made, Nature seems necessitated to fall back, and re-exert herself on the lower ground which she had before occupied, that of the vital magnetism, or the power of reproduction. The intensity of this latter power in the fishes, is shown both in their voracity and in the number of their eggs, which we are obliged to calculate by weight, not by tale. There is an equal intensity both of the immanent and the projective reproduction, in which, if we take in the comparative number of individuals in each species, and likewise the different intervals between the acts, the fish (it is probable) would be found to stand in a similar relation to the insect, as the insect, in the latter point, stands to the system of vegetation. Meantime, the fish sinks a step below the insect, in the mode and circumstances of impregnation. To this we will venture to add, the predominance of length, as the form of growth in so large a proportion of the known orders of fishes, and not less of their rectilineal path of motion. In all other respects, the correspondence combined with the progress in individuation, is striking in the whole detail. Thus the eye, in addition to its moveability, has besides acquired a saline moisture in its higher development, as accordant with the life of its element. Add to these the glittering covering in both, the splendour of the scales in the one answering to the brilliant plates in the other,—the luminous reservoirs of the fire-flies,—the phosphorescence and electricity of many fishes,—the same analogs of moral qualities, in their rapacity, boldness, modes of seizing their prey by surprise,—their gills, as presenting the intermediate state between the spiracula of the grade next below, and the lungs of the step next above, both extremes of which seem combined in the structure of birds and of their quill-feathers; but above all, the convexity of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>lens,</b> so much greater than in birds, quadrupeds, and man, and seeming to collect, in one powerful organ, the hundred-fold microscopic facettes of the insect’s light organs; and it will not be easy to resist the conviction, that the same power is at work in both, and reappears under higher auspices. The intention of Nature is repeated; but, as was to have been expected, with two main differences.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: New {{strategies}} {{have been developed}} for surgical treatment of high myopia. Recently, implantation of minus power posterior chamber intraocular lenses (IOL) into phakic eyes has been introduced. METHODS: We report a 37 year-old female patient who developed bilateral anterior subcapsular cataract 7 years after minus-power, top hat-style silicone posterior chamber IOL implantation in Russia. The corrected visual acuity was right eye 20 / 200 and left eye 20 / 63. Because of the high myopia and the posterior chamber IOL in her phakic eyes, biometry for IOL calculation gave contradictory results. Both posterior chamber IOLs were found to be adherent to the <b>crystalline</b> <b>lenses.</b> After posterior chamber IOL explantation and phacoemulsification, intraoperative retinoscopy was performed. With this aphakic refraction, the IOL power was calculated and implanted. The explanted posterior chamber IOLs were examined by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: After bilateral operation the correc [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Designing {{lighting}} for {{the elderly}} requires special consideration and care from architects and lighting designers. As people age, they experience neurodegeneration in the retina and in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Less light reaches {{the back of the}} eyes because the pupils decrease in size as you age, the lens inside your eye becomes thicker, and the lens scatters more light, causing objects and colors to appear less vivid. These symptoms are particularly common with persons having alzheimer's disease. Older people also have reduced levels of retinal illuminance, such as having smaller pupils and less transparent <b>crystalline</b> <b>lenses.</b> Furthermore, as an individual ages, he or she begins to lose retinal neurons, which not only compromises the ability to see but also to register a robust daily pattern of light-dark that is needed to maintain biological rhythms. The 24-hour light-dark cycle is the most important external stimulus for regulating the timing of the circadian cycle.|$|R
40|$|SummaryOne of {{the reasons}} that the <b>crystalline</b> <b>lenses</b> of {{vertebrate}} eyes are highly transparent {{is that most of the}} cells have broken down all of their organelles, including the nuclei. These cells can neither synthesize new proteins nor generate energy by electron transport in the mitochondria [1, 2]. Only in the peripheral layers—in the cichlid fish Aequidens pulcher, beyond 92 % of the lens radius—are there cells with full complements of organelles. We report here that the optical properties of the lens change between the light-adapted and dark-adapted states in A. pulcher. Changes occur even in cell layers free of organelles, and they occur in parallel with changes in retinal function between the light-adapted (all-cone, color vision) and dark-adapted (all-rod, grayscale vision) states. Depleting the eye of dopamine also caused changes in the optical properties similar to those of dark adaptation. Our results indicate that the refractive index of the organelle-free lens fiber cells can be adjusted quickly and accurately...|$|R
