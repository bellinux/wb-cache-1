5|$|By 1994, Copeland's {{mother had}} {{separated}} from Robert. After living with various friends and boyfriends, DelaCerna moved {{with all of}} her children into two small rooms at the Sunset Inn in Gardena, California. In early 1996, <b>Cantine</b> convinced Copeland to attend a ballet class at her local Boys & Girls Club. Cynthia Bradley, a friend of Cantine's, taught a free ballet class at the club once a week. Copeland attended several classes as a spectator before participating. DelaCerna allowed Copeland {{to go to the}} club after school until the workday ended. Bradley invited Copeland to attend class at her small local ballet school, San Pedro Dance Center. Copeland initially declined the offer, however, because her mother did not have a car, was working 12–14 hours a day, and her oldest sister Erica was working two jobs. Copeland began her ballet studies at the age of 13 at the San Pedro Dance Center when Cynthia Bradley began picking her up from school. After three months of study, Copeland was en pointe.|$|E

500|$|Between {{the ages}} of three and seven, Copeland lived in Bellflower, California, {{with her mother and}} her mother's third husband, Harold Brown, a Santa Fe Railroad sales executive.

Copeland never studied ballet or gymnastics formally until her teenage years, but she enjoyed choreographing flips and dance moves to Mariah Carey songs in her youth. Following in the footsteps of her older sister Erica, who had starred on the Dana Middle School drill team that won statewide competitions, Copeland became captain of the Dana drill team. Her captaincy was only a part of her responsibilities; she was also the sixth grade class treasurer and a hall monitor that year.
