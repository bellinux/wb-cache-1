The flooding mechanism and the factors affecting the onset of 18 flooding of the three-phase direct <b>contact</b> <b>column</b> are not considered. A short Perspex column 19 of 70 cm total height and 4 cm internal diameter utilising two immiscible fluids was studied. 20 Pentane vapour with initial temperatures of 40 °C, 43. 5 °C and 47. 5 ℃ was the dispersed phase 21 and tap water at a constant temperature (19 ℃) was the continuous phase.

After microscreen filtration, two variable speed pumps are operated in parallel to supply between 400 to 2, 400 L/min to the ozone treatment system. Ozone contained within an approximately 95 % oxygen feed gas is transferred in to the water (at 0. 5 - 0. 7 bar) through a down flow bubble contactor following each pump.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) is used in packed beds to treat trace quantities of icropollutants. Many years of research and industrial use has ensured that it is highly effective as a water treatment process. However, GAC is expensive and economic considerations mean {{it has to be}} recovered and re-used Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC; is a cheaper alternative but the particle size range means it is unsuitable for packed bed applications. This thesis describes a novel method for utilising PAC to treat micropollutants. By contacting carbon paracles with air bubbles, under conditions o. lrotational shear and a binding agent, oleyl alcohol, carbon-coated air bubbles form which remain stable while agitated byflowing water. A stabilised air bubble can be visualised as a phere with an impervious core (the air bubble), surrounded by a thin layer of porous matehal (PAC). Theory dictates that all these stabilised air bubbles can be moved counter-currently to a contaminated stream, higher throughputs than conventional packed beds are possible. Several aspects of this process are investigated. Bubble generation is critical and so the literature was reviewed to explain the mechanisms involved Practical use was made of this knowledge in designing a larger bubble generator. Transferring the coated-bubbles to a <b>contacting</b> <b>column</b> was difficult. Problems associated with the various methods employed are described and recommendations are made for improvement. The <b>contacting</b> <b>column</b> was used to assess the stability and adsorptive capacity of the bubbles. The possibility of counter-current flow using stabilised air bubbles was also evaluated and found to be incompatible with the current column design. The stabilised bubbles collected in the column resembled an inverted fluidised bed. Experiments were performed to test Richardson and Zaki's hydrodynamic laws for conventional fluidised beds were applicable to inverted beds. The adsorptive capacity of the bubbles was assessed by dosing the water with trace levels of phenol and p-chlorophenol. Samples taken from before and after the fluidised bed were analysed and compared. The results were inconclusive, although the concentration profile produced indicated that flow through the bubble bed was piston-flow...|$|R

40|$|Use of amine {{for removal}} of carbon dioxide, CO 2, from {{natural gas is}} the most common method. In several of these removal units, {{operational}} problems because of foaming are reported. Further examination of these problems will in most cases show that the problem is not foaming, but will however be temporarily fixed by adding foam inhibitors.

Foaming can lead to entrainment of liquids into downstream process equipment, and might lead to a situation where the process specifications for CO 2 cannot be met.

In the present study, the procedure was {{developed a}}nd validated for MellapakPlus 752. Y and Katapak-SP packings, but it may be applied to any type of metallic or modular packing of similar dimensions. Steps of tomographic image processing and associated parameters (threshold, calibration factors for solid and liquid phase) were first determined on images of dry and flooded packing elements of MellapakPlus 752. Y. The parameter values were then adapted to analyse images of dry and flooded packing elements of Katapak-SP, which are made of an alternation of MellapakPlus 752. Y sheets and catalytic baskets. In a certain way, MellapakPlus 752. Y and Katapak-SP (11 and 12), the global geometrical properties of which are well known, are used as physical phantoms to develop a validated image post-processing procedure. The latter is used to quantitatively analyse liquid distribution images in irrigated MellapakPlus 752. Y and Katapak-SP (11 and 12) packings, giving access to spatial distribution of local values of hydrodynamic quantities such as the liquid holdup and gas-liquid interfacial area. Global values of the liquid hold-up, relative to the whole packed bed volume are determined by averaging tomographic results over the column height. They are successfully compared with bed scale data measured on the same MellapakPlus 752. Y and Katapak-SP (11 and 12). This analysis further validates the procedure used for the processing of tomographic irrigated images.

40|$|We report {{progress}} {{in the study of}} thick CZT strip detectors for 3 -D imaging and spectroscopy and discuss two approaches to device design. Unlike double-sided strip detectors, these devices feature both row and <b>column</b> <b>contacts</b> implemented on the anode surface. This electron-only approach circumvents problems associated with poor hole transport in CZT that normally limit the thickness and energy range of double-sided strip detectors. The work includes laboratory and simulation studies aimed at developing compact, efficient, detector modules for 0. 05 to 1 MeV gamma radiation measurements while minimizing the number and complexity of the electronic readout channels. These devices can achieve similar performance to pixel detectors for both 3 -D imaging and spectroscopy.

40|$|Multiscale (analytical and computational) {{models have}} been {{developed}} based on a thermodynamic variational principle (TVP) to model sintering and eventual mudcracking in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) made using the electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) process. It is assumed that the sintering occurs by interfacial diffusion at local <b>contacts</b> between <b>columns</b> and driven by changes in interface free energy and elastic stored energy of the coating. The models link diffusional processes at the scale of <b>contacting</b> feathery <b>columns</b> with the macroscopic deformation and sintering response. In service, the columns can come into contact and sinter together. As sintering progresses there is a build up of strain energy in the system which reduces the driving force for sintering and leads to either complete or incomplete sintering of the TBC depending on the magnitude of effective modulus (E) of the coating. By seeding the coating with initial imperfections, different types of behaviour are observed depending {{on the value of}} E and the spacing between imperfections. For compliant coatings, the response is insensitive to the presence of imperfections and the coating fully sinters. At higher values of E, strain energy is released by the development of intercolumnar cracks in the coating, which can propagate to the interface with the TGO (thermally grown oxide), deflect into the interface and propagate, leading to spallation of regions of the coating and loss of thermal protection. It is observed that cracks develop at initial imperfections in the structure. The greater the spacing between imperfections the faster the development of cracks at these locations. If a TBC contains a distribution of imperfections there is progressive formation of cracks, with the average spacing decreasing with time, after an initial incubation period. The crack density eventually saturates to a constant value, which depends on the mechanical properties of the TBC. Initially, a crack spacing, CS, in the range 1. 5 H ≤ CS ≤ 3 H has been predicted based on trapezoidal contact models. Here H is the thickness of the coating. Crack spacing predicted using this model is consistent in the lower range of experimentally observed crack spacing. However, axisymmetric contact models predict a crack spacing, CS, in the range 4 H ≤ CS ≤ 8 H, which is in good agreement with experimentally observed crack spacing range 3 H ≤ CS ≤ 10 H reported in the literature. Compared to the trapezoidal contact models, axisymmetric contact models more accurately predict the sintering response. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
