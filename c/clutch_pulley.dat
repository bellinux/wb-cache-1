40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{a new concept}} of portable air conditioner which integrated with some available components in automotive air conditioning system. This new idea intends to solve the storage problems {{as well as to}} reduce the price of current portable air conditioner since some devices could directly be used from the automotive air conditioning system. The primary emphasis of this study was on the modification of automotive compressor design so as the system may alternately be operated. The length of conventional compressor shaft is extended to place an additional <b>clutch</b> <b>pulley,</b> a drive plate and a clutch coil. The new concept particularly the shaft and pulley were analysed through slope deflection and computational finite element analyses. The result of engineering analyses exhibited that the new design of compressor shaft and clutch pulleys promote a low risk of failure as the data values recorded are lower than the critical value for each criterion investigated...|$|E
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1940's and early 1950's, Charles H. Miner of Denver, CO made {{significant}} developments {{in creating a}} CVT by inventing the [...] "Variable Speed Clutch Pulley".  He filed and was granted multiple US patents for his CVT system using steel balls and centrifugal force to manipulate the moveable side of the power end of his V-belt  clutch.  He formed a manufacturing company (Miner Pulley) in Denver and built <b>clutch</b> <b>pulleys</b> until he sold the company to Warner Clutch due to health reasons.  See US Patent US2974544 A for diagrams and details.|$|R
5000|$|Turbochargers suffer (to {{a greater}} or lesser extent) from {{so-called}} turbo-spool (turbo lag; more correctly, boost lag), in which initial acceleration from low RPM is limited by the lack of sufficient exhaust gas mass flow (pressure). Once engine RPM is sufficient to raise the turbine RPM into its designed operating range, there is a rapid increase in power, as higher turbo boost causes more exhaust gas production, which spins the turbo yet faster, leading to a belated [...] "surge" [...] of acceleration. This makes the maintenance of smoothly increasing RPM far harder with turbochargers than with engine-driven superchargers, which apply boost in direct proportion to the engine RPM. The main advantage of an engine with a mechanically driven supercharger is better throttle response, as well as the ability to reach full-boost pressure instantaneously. With the latest turbocharging technology and direct gasoline injection, throttle response on turbocharged cars is nearly as good as with mechanically powered superchargers, but the existing lag time is still considered a major drawback, especially considering {{that the vast majority of}} mechanically driven superchargers are now driven off <b>clutched</b> <b>pulleys,</b> much like an air compressor.|$|R
5000|$|Ignition was via a magneto, and {{the engine}} was started using bicycle-style pedals. Instead of a {{conventional}} <b>clutch,</b> a <b>pulley</b> belt tensioner could be moved, allowing the leather drive belt to slip. [...] Touting its effective muffler, Harley-Davidson advertised the 7D, and the other Harleys of this era, as [...] "The Silent Gray Fellow." [...] The latter moniker was also in reference to William S. Harley, who {{was known for his}} quiet personality. A 1911 Model 7D from the George Pardo collection was set to be auctioned in January 2014.|$|R
40|$|A {{water spray}} chumming system {{consisting}} of a 65 x 50 mm centrifugal pump driven by the propulsion engine through a PTO <b>clutch</b> and 'V' <b>pulley</b> power transmission system has been developed for the pole and line fishing of tuna. Water is sprayed through pipe loop system fitted {{on the edge of}} the fishing platform of the boat through small holes. The distance of the spray length can be adjusted by controlling the flow of the pump discharge water through a wheel valve...|$|R
50|$|The RS01 uses a {{frameless}} {{block construction}} with a rigid rear axle and a front swing axle with leaf springs. Engines {{of the type}} 4F 145 BE are used, they are water-cooled inline four cylinder four stroke diesel engines with prechamber injection and five litres of displacement. The rated power is 29,4 kW. This engine is started using a crank and petrol, it is switched to diesel fuel afterwards. The torque is transmitted to the mechanical five speed gearbox with a single disc dry clutch; only the rear wheels are driven. They are equipped with drum brakes, the handbrake is a gear box brake. For power take-off, the RS01 has a PTO which depends on the <b>clutch.</b> A belt <b>pulley</b> was also available for the RS01. Starting in 1953, the prechamber engine was replaced with a turbulence chamber engine, which is started using compressed air.|$|R
