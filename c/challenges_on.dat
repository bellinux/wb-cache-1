5|$|On Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, both contestants {{on a team}} {{competed in}} all {{physical}} challenges. For the 1988 version of Family Double Dare, all four members of a team competed in the <b>challenges.</b> <b>On</b> the 1990–93 version of Family Double Dare and on Double Dare 2000, two members of a team competed in round one, and all four members competed in round two.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{challenges}} {{were often}} messy stunts that a team had {{to perform in}} a specified time, usually 20 or 30 seconds, although occasionally 10 or 15 seconds. All physical <b>challenges</b> <b>on</b> Double Dare 2000 were 30 seconds in length, unless a time reduction was in play due to the Triple Dare Challenge. The team won money and retained control for completing the stunt. Otherwise, the money and control passed to their opponents.|$|E
5|$|Although by {{the close}} of the 1860s, Denver {{residents}} could look with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center, the decision to route the nation's first transcontinental railroad through Cheyenne, rather than Denver, threatened the prosperity of the young town. A daunting 100 miles away, citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect Denver to the transcontinental railroad. Spearheaded by visionary leaders including Territorial Governor John Evans, David Moffat, and Walter Cheesman, fundraising began. Within three days, $300,000 had been raised, and citizens were optimistic. Fundraising stalled before enough was raised, forcing these visionary leaders {{to take control of the}} debt-ridden railroad. Despite <b>challenges,</b> <b>on</b> June 24, 1870, citizens cheered as the Denver Pacific completed the link to the transcontinental railroad, ushering in a new age of prosperity for Denver.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his defeat}} of Metatron {{and access to}} Heaven having been restored, Castiel {{continues}} to face <b>challenges</b> <b>on</b> a personal and large scale, as some angels prefer to remain on Earth and his stolen Grace continues to consume him. Although Metatron has hinted {{that he may be}} able to help Castiel with a remaining fragment of his original Grace, Castiel has rejected the option of making a deal with Metatron to save his own life. Sam and Dean remain ignorant of Castiel's fate, although Crowley is aware of Castiel's condition, at one point killing another angel to transfer her Grace to Castiel so that Castiel could help Sam cure the now-demonic Dean after he was transformed by the Mark of Cain.|$|E
5|$|The 100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating (or Plenty: One Man, One Woman, and a Raucous Year of Eating Locally) is a non-fiction {{book written}} by Canadian writers Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon. In the book, the authors recount their experiences, {{including}} motivations and <b>challenges,</b> <b>on</b> restricting their diet, for one year, to include only foods grown within 100 miles of their residence. Beginning in March 2005, with little preparation the urban couple began only purchasing foods with ingredients they knew were all from within 100 miles. Finding little in grocery stores, {{they relied on}} farmers' markets and visits to local farms. Staples in their diet included seafood, chicken, root vegetable, berries, and corn. They lacked cooking oils, rice, and sugar. They preserved foods {{for use in the}} winter but ended with extra supplies.|$|E
5|$|William faced several <b>challenges</b> <b>on</b> {{becoming}} duke, {{including his}} illegitimate birth and his youth: the {{evidence indicates that}} he was either {{seven or eight years}} old at the time. He enjoyed the support of his great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as the king of France, Henry I, enabling him to succeed to his father's duchy. The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies, but Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supporters, and conditions in Normandy quickly descended into chaos.|$|E

5|$|In Challenge mode, {{the player}} must sneak around and deliver food to hungry NPCs. Hunger is {{indicated}} above thought bubbles which float above {{the heads of}} the NPCs. An NPC with a burger icon over their head is able to be given food, but they will lose their appetite if they spot the player. NPCs move around the map in a set pattern and have a narrow cone of vision to detect player. Erik Brudvig of IGN described this narrow cone of vision as being similar to those of Metal Gear Solid. NPCs can also detect the player by excessive noise, the amount of sound a player is making is indicated by a noise meter. Challenges can be failed if a player alerts NPCs to their presence. Successful delivery of an item requires sneaking up behind an NPC or surprising them from a hiding place. Points are awarded based on how hungry a character is, the player's stealth and proximity to the NPC and style points on delivery. When presenting food, a Flourish meter appears which quickly fills and empties, requiring a timed button press. The higher the flourish meter, the more style points. Each level has 20 associated challenges and fulfilling half the <b>challenges</b> <b>on</b> a level opens the way to the next level. Once all 80 challenges are completed, an alternative costume is unlocked. Gamerscore is rewarded for achieving certain goals or style on the Xbox 360 version.|$|E

25|$|Binns' {{popularity}} {{was tested}} {{as the government}} weathered <b>challenges</b> <b>on</b> many fronts. Unpredictability in federal equalization, coupled with rising health care and energy costs and weakness in the primary and tourism sectors, put pressure on provincial finances. Clashes {{with the federal government}} over the fiscal imbalance and fisheries management continued for several years. Binns launched a Program Renewal process to streamline duplication and improve delivery of public services. The provincial public service was reduced by several hundred people as services were reorganized and administrative overlap was reduced in the health sector, evidenced by the disappearance of doctors in West Prince. These measures, along with a steadily growing economy, have led to continued improvement of public finances.|$|E
25|$|Each row of {{the band}} has one Squad Leader, and one Assistant Squad Leader, with {{exception}} of J row which has two Assistants. The role of the Squad Leaders {{is to make sure}} their respective rows are at rehearsal on time, take attendance for the row, and make sure all members in the row are striving for their best during each rehearsal and performance. Squad Leaders also run Friday music checks and game day uniform and instrument inspections, as well as judge the row <b>challenges</b> <b>on</b> Mondays. The Squad Leaders must also try out for the band, typically during the week before the rest of the band does their tryouts. Squad Leaders have been cut from the band in past years. In this case, the Assistant would become Head Squad Leader, and one of the highest scoring returning band members would be offered the position of Assistant.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{contribution}} Ralya {{has made}} to the Bahá'í Faith in fiction is that her works center on the moral dilemmas of modern society {{in the west and}} spiritual insights and development that reflect an understanding of the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith in response to these <b>challenges.</b> <b>On</b> the one hand she has envisioned an attainable utopia (that is, not completely perfect) with specifics based on suggestions made in writings of the Bahá'í Faith. A particularly strong analysis is made of marital fidelity vs the divine law against adultery vs intense love and friendship {{between a man and a}} woman not married, though many topics are addressed including the moral and practical need for war, sustainable economics if children and mothers are of central importance to society, attitudes of the oneness of humanity vs racism, the importance of the arts and so on. On the other hand, she has examined many of the same issues in young ladies lives in high school.|$|E
