5|$|Archaeopteryx is a genus of {{theropod}} dinosaur {{closely related}} to the birds. Since the late 19th century, it has been accepted by palaeontologists, and celebrated in lay reference works, as being the oldest known bird, though a study in 2011 has <b>cast</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> this assessment, suggesting instead that it is a non-avialan dinosaur {{closely related to}} the origin of birds.|$|E

5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of several dromaeosaurids (Microraptor, Sinornithosaurus, and Velociraptor) and modern birds and {{reptiles}} indicate that some dromaeosaurids (including Microraptor and Velociraptor) {{may have been}} nocturnal predators, while Sinornithosaurus is inferred to be cathemeral (active throughout the day at short intervals). However, the discovery of iridescent plumage in Microraptor has <b>cast</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> the inference of nocturnality in this genus, as no modern birds that have iridescent plumage {{are known to be}} nocturnal.|$|E
5|$|Iguanodon was {{recorded}} from Africa based on teeth from Tunisia {{and elsewhere in}} the Sahara, but the description of Lurdusaurus and Ouranosaurus <b>cast</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> African records of Iguanodon.

Another North American species, from South Dakota, once assigned to Iguanodon as I. lakotaensis, has since been reclassified as the genus Dakotadon.|$|E

5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations <b>cast</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> this possibility.

5|$|In 1994, Mikhailov {{suggested}} that Macroolithus represented the eggs {{of a large}} theropod, specifically Tarbosaurus, based on the large size of the eggs and the largely overlapping distribution.

With the discovery of multiple oviraptorosaur-elongatoolithid associations in the late 1990s, the eggs of elongatoolithids came to be accepted as belonging to oviraptorosaurian dinosaurs. Oviraptorid parentage was confirmed for Macroolithus when, in 2008, oviraptorid embryos resembling Heyuannia were discovered inside a pair of M. yaotunensis eggs in Jiangxi.|$|E

Lockheed Martin responded to talk of CAPES cancellation with a fixed-price upgrade package for foreign users. CAPES {{was not included in}} the Pentagon's 2015 budget request. The USAF said that the upgrade package will still be offered to Taiwan, and Lockheed said that some common elements with the F-35 will keep the radar's unit costs down.

5|$|In its 2007 expose , the {{political}} weekly Tehelka released hidden camera footage of {{several members of}} the Bharatiya Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal admitting their role in the riots.

Bajrangi and Suresh Richard said that Narendra Modi visited Naroda Patiya a day after the massacre to thank them, but the official record shows that Modi did not visit Naroda Patiya.
