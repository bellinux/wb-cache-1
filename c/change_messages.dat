5000|$|... "Control Change" [...] {{messages}} (frequently wrongly called Continuous Controller) {{are quite}} versatile; {{they are usually}} generated by a musician using knobs, sliders, footswitches, or pressure on a physical MIDI controller (or MIDI-equipped instrument). While the response to these messages is generally totally up to the receiving device, they are typically used to change the tone, timbre, or volume of an instrument's sound. In non-musical applications of MIDI, Control <b>Change</b> <b>messages</b> {{can be used to}} move motorized faders, to dim lights, or even to move a motorized joint in an animatronic figure.|$|E
5000|$|Program <b>change</b> <b>messages</b> {{are sent}} to an {{instrument}} on a particular channel to instruct it to recall another patch, or program. The MIDI protocol uses 7 bits for this message, supporting only 128 programs to change to. Many devices which are more modern than the MIDI specification store far more than 128 programs. To overcome the limitation, a bank-switching method {{has been added to}} the spec (Each bank of 128 programs can be selected using two controller messages for MSB and LSB, enabling access to 16,384 banks of 128 programs, or a total of 2,097,152 programs).|$|E
5000|$|MIDI {{devices are}} usually {{designed}} to be wired in a daisy chain. It is normal for a device to have both a THRU port and an OUT port and often both {{can be used for}} chaining. The THRU port transmits the information through with minimal delay and no alteration, while the OUT port sends a completely regenerated signal and may add, remove, or <b>change</b> <b>messages,</b> at the cost of some delay in doing so. The difference can result in the signals arriving at different times; if the chain is long enough, it will be distorted so much that the system can become unreliable or non-functional.|$|E

30|$|Recently, debates {{focusing}} on eco-labels and general consumers’ purchasing behavior {{have emerged in}} two fields of literature.

There is a gap between awareness of eco-information and eco-friendly behavior.|$|R

5000|$|A superset of the General MIDI {{standard}} which added several proprietary extensions.

Other most notable features were 9 Drum kits with 14 additional drum sounds each, simultaneous Percussion Kits - up to 2 (Channels 10/11), Control <b>Change</b> <b>messages</b> for controlling the send level of sound effect blocks (cc#91-94), entering additional parameters (cc#98-101), portamento, sostenuto, soft pedal (cc#65-67), and model-specific SysEx messages for setting various parameters of the synth engine.|$|E

50|$|MIDI allows {{selection}} of an instrument's sounds through program <b>change</b> <b>messages,</b> {{but there is}} no guarantee that any two instruments have the same sound at a given program location. Program #0 may be a piano on one instrument, or a flute on another. The General MIDI (GM) standard was established in 1991, and provides a standardized sound bank that allows a Standard MIDI File created on one device to sound similar when played back on another. GM specifies a bank of 128 sounds arranged into 16 families of eight related instruments, and assigns a specific program number to each instrument. Percussion instruments are placed on channel 10, and a specific MIDI note value is mapped to each percussion sound. GM-compliant devices must offer 24-note polyphony. Any given program change will select the same instrument sound on any GM-compatible instrument.|$|E
40|$|Ever {{increasing}} {{global competition}} {{and the rate of}} technological innovation has meant that companies in the 21 st century have to change and adapt on a continual basis in order to survive in this dynamic and evolving business environment. In a bid to simultaneously achieve cost reduction and increase IT capability, companies are increasingly choosing to outsource activities to achieve their business goals. However attractive on paper, outsourcing can lead to fundamental changes for an organisation and its employees. Consequently, it also generates many challenges for leadership within the organisation to succeed with these changes. The efforts and activities an organisation undertakes to bring employees through a change program are critical to the program’s success. These collective communication efforts and activities are referred to as the <b>change</b> <b>message.</b> Using a qualitative analysis of a case study, this dissertation explores how a company’s strategy for communicating this <b>change</b> <b>message</b> impacts on <b>change</b> resistance and readiness through the phases of change. Findings from this study have shown that additional considerations such as enhancing the communications strategy can result in a more seamless, less antagonistic, and ultimately an enhanced likelihood of a successful change program...|$|R

5000|$|Channel Voice {{messages}} transmit real-time {{performance data}} over a single channel. Examples include [...] "note-on" [...] messages which contain a MIDI note number that specifies the note's pitch, a velocity value that indicates how forcefully the note was played, {{and the channel}} number; [...] "note-off" [...] messages that end a note; program <b>change</b> <b>messages</b> that change a device's patch; and control changes that allow adjustment of an instrument's parameters. Channel Mode messages include the Omni/mono/poly mode on and off messages, as well as messages to reset all controllers to their default state or to send [...] "note-off" [...] messages for all notes. System messages do not include channel numbers, and are received by every device in the MIDI chain. MIDI time code {{is an example of}} a System Common message. System Real-Time messages provide for synchronization, and include MIDI clock and Active Sensing.|$|E
50|$|The Arab Spring {{is another}} example. Born in Tunisia in December 2010, growing unrest spread through several Arab {{countries}} in the Middle East, including Egypt, Syria and Yemen. Researchers studying resource mobilization through the Egyptian Revolution during the Arab Spring found a reliance on social media to spread social action messages while the governments worked to censor the media and cut off those countries {{from the rest of}} the world by severing the Internet. The activists in those countries were communicating with each other through social media platforms like Twitter to coordinate protests, keep tabs on each other and spread the social <b>change</b> <b>messages.</b> The researchers noted the Egyptian Revolution demonstrated the use of social media to rapidly spread messages of social change and mobilized large groups of people. Another group of researchers studying social movements in Tunisia during the Arab Spring found cyber activism sprang from grievances about increasing government restrictions on Internet use for political purposes coupled with lack of socio-economic opportunities.|$|E

The MATCH {{was composed of}} three main system components: Decoding, Matching, and Provisioning. The Decoding module would decode core memory dumps from the AT&T 1AESS, 5AESS, Nortel DMS-100, and operating databases including COSMOS and TIRKS.

The Matching module would compare two populated databases, being a source and target, and compute the functional transform required to bring the target system {{in line with the}} source. The Provisioning model examined the transform function and generated the necessary AT&T 5AESS recent <b>change</b> <b>messages</b> and DMS-100 service updates to reproduce telephony services provided by the old switch on the new switching platform.|$|E
