25|$|When a {{fastener}} is torqued, a tension preload develops in the bolt and an equal compressive preload develops in the parts being fastened. This can be modeled as a spring-like assembly {{that has some}} assumed distribution of <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> in the clamped joint components. When an external tension load is applied, it relieves the compressive strains induced by the preload in the clamped components, hence the preload acting on the compressed joint components provides the external tension load with a path (through the joint) other than through the bolt. In a well designed joint, perhaps 80-90% of the externally applied tension load will pass through the joint and the remainder through the bolt. This reduces the fatigue loading of the bolt.|$|E

50|$|The use {{of various}} strain {{engineering}} techniques {{has been reported}} by many prominent microprocessor manufacturers, including AMD, IBM, and Intel, primarily with regards to sub-130 nm technologies. One key consideration in using strain engineering in CMOS technologies is that PMOS and NMOS respond differently to different types of strain. Specifically, PMOS performance is best served by applying <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> to the channel, whereas NMOS receives benefit from tensile strainhttp://www.realworldtech.com/page.cfm?ArticleID=RWT123005001504&p=6. Many approaches to strain engineering induce strain locally, allowing both n-channel and p-channel strain to be modulated independently.|$|E
50|$|The {{strained}} bonds {{around a}} dislocation {{are characterized by}} lattice strain fields. For example, there are compressively strained bonds directly next to an edge dislocation and tensilely strained bonds beyond {{the end of an}} edge dislocation. These form <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> fields and tensile strain fields, respectively. Strain fields are analogous to electric fields in certain ways. Specifically, the strain fields of dislocations obey similar laws of attraction and repulsion; in order to reduce overall strain, compressive strains are attracted to tensile strains, and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|A second {{prominent}} approach {{involves the}} use of a silicon-rich solid solution, especially silicon-germanium, to modulate channel strain. One manufacturing method involves epitaxial growth of silicon on top of a relaxed silicon-germanium underlayer. Tensile strain is induced in the silicon as the lattice of the silicon layer is stretched to mimic the larger lattice constant of the underlying silicon-germanium. Conversely, <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> could be induced by using a solid solution with a smaller lattice constant, such as silicon-carbon. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,023,018. Another closely related method involves replacing the source and drain region of a MOSFET with silicon-germanium.|$|E
50|$|More recent {{methods of}} {{inducing}} strain include doping {{the source and}} drain with lattice mismatched atoms such as germanium and carbon. Germanium doping of up to 20% in the P-channel MOSFET source and drain causes uniaxial <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> in the channel, increasing hole mobility. Carbon doping as low as 0.25% in the N-channel MOSFET source and drain causes uniaxial tensile strain in the channel, increasing electron mobility. Covering the NMOS transistor with a highly stressed silicon nitride layer {{is another way to}} create uniaxial tensile strain. As opposed to wafer-level methods of inducing strain on the channel layer prior to MOSFET fabrication, the aforementioned methods use strain induced during the MOSFET fabrication itself to alter the carrier mobility in the transistor channel.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of the Au (100) surface is an interesting example of how a cubic structure can be reconstructed into a different symmetry, {{as well as the}} temperature dependence of a reconstruction. In the bulk gold is an (fcc) metal, with a surface structure reconstructed into a distorted hexagonal phase. This hexagonal phase {{is often referred to as}} a (28×5) structure, distorted and rotated by about 0.81° relative to the 011 crystal direction. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that this rotation occurs to partly relieve a <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> developed in the formation of this hexagonal reconstruction, which is nevertheless favored thermodynamically over the unreconstructed structure. However, this rotation disappears in a phase transition at approximately T=970 K, above which an un-rotated hexagonal structure is observed.|$|E
40|$|Atomistic {{simulations}} of uniaxial tensile and <b>compressive</b> <b>straining</b> of three-dimensional nanocrystalline palladium were performed {{at room temperature}} and different strain rates.

Intergranular cracking in the absence of dislocation activity was found at later stages of tensile <b>straining.</b> During <b>compressive</b> <b>straining</b> the sample shows a plastic response which is brought about mainly by intergranular accommodation processes.

Furthermore, the <b>compressive</b> <b>strains</b> increased with time due to creep and shrinkage of the concrete. However, as shown in Fig.  5 b, the lateral displacement measured by the LVDT at the top did not increase during the sustained duration.

5000|$|The {{sinusoidal}} {{electrical input}} signal creates alternating polarity between {{the fingers of}} the interdigitated transducer. Between two adjacent sets of fingers, polarity of the fingers will be switched (e.g. + - +). As a result, {{the direction of the}} electric field between two fingers will alternate between adjacent sets of fingers. This creates alternating regions of tensile and <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> between fingers of the electrode by the piezoelectric effect, producing a mechanical wave at the surface known as a surface acoustic wave.

50|$|When solute and solvent atoms {{differ in}} size, local stress fields are created that can attract or repel dislocations in their vicinity. This {{is known as}} the size effect. By {{relieving}} tensile or <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> in the lattice, the solute size mismatch can put the dislocation in a lower energy state. In substitutional solid solutions, these stress fields are spherically symmetric, meaning they have no shear stress component. As such, substitutional solute atoms do not interact with the shear stress fields characteristic of screw dislocations. Conversely, in interstitial solid solutions, solute atoms cause a tetragonal distortion, generating a shear field that can interact with edge, screw, and mixed dislocations. The attraction or repulsion of the dislocation centers to the solute particles increase the stress it takes to propagate the dislocation in any other direction. Increasing the applied stress necessary to move the dislocation increases the yield strength of the material.|$|E

The <b>compressive</b> <b>strains</b> of concrete and reinforcing bars continuously increased with time, but the increasing rates differed. The <b>compressive</b> <b>strains</b> of concrete and reinforcing bars measured at three different heights were nearly identical, which indicates that E- 30 - 1 with an aspect ratio 3.0 (i.e. the ratio of the shear span-to-overall section depth) was subjected to uniform bending moment Msus over the height (compare blue, red, and green lines in Fig.  6 c–f).|$|R

40|$|In this research, an {{experimental}} method {{for measuring the}} clamping force {{as a result of}} tightening torque in double lap simple bolted and hybrid (bolted-bonded) joints is proposed. Two types of joints, i. e. double lap simple and hybrid (bolted-bonded) joints were prepared for testing. In order to measure the clamping force or pretension resulting from the tightening torque at different applied torques, for both types of joints, a special experimental method was designed using a steel bush that was placed between the nut and the plate. Two strain gauges were stuck to the outer surface of the bush to measure the <b>compressive</b> axial <b>strain</b> and also the stress in the bush using Hooke’s law. Finally, the axial force in the bush and subsequently the clamping force were determined. The test was repeated three times for each case to obtain the mean value of <b>compressive</b> <b>strains</b> and to determine the corresponding clamping forces. The relationship between the applied tightening torques and the mean value of <b>compressive</b> <b>strains</b> for both types of joints are shown in graphs...|$|R

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the defined trend in tensile strain, the <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> increases with increases in mud pressure (Fig.  21). There is a remarkable difference in the progression in <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> between the lower and upper mud weight regimes with {{the rate of increase}} being considerably higher at higher mud pressures. Prior to the attainment of a mud pressure of 35  MPa, the lower bound <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> increases at a rate of 5.8 e− 7 /MPa, then escalates sharply to a steep rate of 2.03 e− 5 /MPa beyond this value (Fig.  21 a). The same pattern occurs {{at the other end of}} the scale (the upper bound) (Fig.  21 b), where the <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> increases at 6.4 e− 6 below 35  MPa and then accelerates to 5.25 e− 4 above 35  MPa. Consequently, the attenuation in tensile strain is followed by synchronised increments in <b>compressive</b> <b>strain.</b>|$|E
30|$|It {{can also}} be seen that the {{tangential}} tensile strain on Region C decreases to zero, while the thickness <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> increases significantly, which causes material accumulation on the round corner of the flange (Region C) and an the increase in wall thickness. In addition, because of bending, in Region C the radial <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> changes to very large radial tensile strain. In Region D, the large radial tensile strain changes to small <b>compressive</b> <b>strain,</b> and the large thickness <b>compressive</b> <b>strain</b> changes to small tensile strain.
