5000|$|In 1984, the UK Government {{began to}} prepare then wholly {{state-owned}} BA for privatisation in earnest by appointing a new {{board of directors}} with several years' experience in private industry and by changing its legal status from a Crown Corporation to a public limited company. BCal's senior management saw this as {{a major threat to}} the company's continuing existence as the UK's second largest international scheduled airline. According to BCal's own calculations, the relevant figures for 1983 had shown that BA alone accounted for 83% of all UK scheduled airline <b>capacity</b> measured <b>in</b> <b>tonne</b> kilometers as opposed to a mere 13-14% for BCal. These figures also showed that BA carried seven-and-a-half times as many passengers as BCal, and that Heathrow's share of international scheduled air traffic was five-and-a-half times greater than Gatwick's (79% and 14% respectively). This meant that a privatised BA on this scale would enjoy far greater financial clout than BCal. It also meant that BA's market power would be disproportionate compared with that of any other UK airline {{as a result of its}} much greater economies of scale. Furthermore, the Government's decision to proceed with BA's privatisation inevitably meant the end of the [...] "Second Force" [...] policy, which had guided BCal's development since its inception. In addition, the transfer of BA's ownership from the public to the private sector meant that BCal could no longer rely on the indirect protection Government ownership afforded it to prevent BA from abusing its power — for example, by engaging in anti-competitive behaviour against BCal.|$|R

50|$|Stackers are {{nominally}} {{rated for}} <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> <b>tonnes</b> per hour (tph). They normally travel on a rail between stockpiles in the stockyard. A stacker can usually move {{in at least}} two directions: horizontally along the rail and vertically by luffing (raising and lowering) its boom. Luffing of the boom minimises dust by reducing the distance that material such as coal needs to fall {{to the top of the}} stockpile. The boom is luffed upwards as the height of the stockpile increases. Some stackers can rotate the boom. This allows a single stacker to form two stockpiles, one on either side of the conveyor.|$|E
50|$|Transportable semi-mobile {{installations}} {{have gained}} increasing {{popularity in the}} last two decades. They are enabled by the fact that complete sensor-based sorting systems are relatively compact in relation to the <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> <b>tonnes</b> per hour. This is mainly because little infrastructure is needed. The picture shows a containerised sensor-based sorter which is applied in Chromitite sorting. The system is operated in conjunction with a Diesel-powered mobile crusher and screen. Material handling of the feed, undersize fraction, product and waste fraction is conducted using a wheel loader. The system is powered by a Diesel generator and a compressor station delivers the instrument quality air needed for the operation.Semi-mobile installations are applied primarily to minimise material handling and save transport costs. Another reason for choosing the semi-mobile option for an installation is bulk testing of new ore bodies.Capacity of a system very much depends on the size fraction sorted, but a 250tph capacity is a good estimate for semi-mobile installations, considering a capacity of 125tph sorter feed and 125tph undersize material.During the last decade both generic plant designs and customised designs have been developed, for example in the framework of the i2mine project.|$|E
