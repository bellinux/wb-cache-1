25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} {{installed}} in a vehicle {{is referred to as}} a mobile station. A typical mobile station is equipped with a transceiver, one or more antennas, and a microphone. The transceiver may be specially designed for installation in vehicles. It may be much smaller than transceivers designed for fixed station use, to facilitate installation under a seat or in a trunk, and it may feature a detachable <b>control</b> <b>head</b> that can be mounted in a separate location {{from the rest of the}} radio. Antennas designed for mobile stations must accommodate the unique physical constraints of the vehicle and travel lanes which it occupies, allowing for clearance under overpasses and bridges, and safe passage by vehicles in adjacent lanes. Most antennas used in mobile stations are omnidirectional. Few mobile stations are equipped to communicate with Morse code or digital modes. Most mobile stations are designed to be operated by the vehicle operator while driving.|$|E

40|$|Foxtail millet {{has much}} varietal {{difference}} in heading time. To our knowledge, however, {{there has been}} no report on the genetic system <b>controlling</b> <b>heading</b> time in foxtail millet. In the present study, genetic analysis of heading time in foxtail millet was performed using the progeny from the cross between two strains differing in heading time, Kuromochi (KM) and Gai 53 (G 53). Response to photoperiod suggested that KM has greater basic vegetative growth (BVG) and photoperiod sensitivity (PS) than G 53. The results of genetic analysis indicate that difference in BVG and PS between the two strains is under polygenic control. The geographical distribution of foxtail millet cultivars and the relationship between foxtail millet and other grasses were discussed from the viewpoint of genes <b>controlling</b> <b>heading</b> time. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{substantia nigra}} {{contains}} two parts: the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). The SNpc obtains {{input from the}} putamen and caudate, and sends information back. The SNpr also obtains input from the putamen and caudate. However, it sends the input outside the basal ganglia to <b>control</b> <b>head</b> and eye movements. The SNpc produces dopamine, which is crucial for movements. The SNpc is the part that degenerates during Parkinson's disease.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} make his skis more efficient, Head made several other changes, like substituting plywood for {{honeycomb}} plastic, covering {{the bottom of the}} ski with polyethylene to avoid the problem of icy bottoms and adopting continuous steel edges to harden the edges of the ski. The new improved skis were almost as heavy as the conventional wooden skis, but were stronger and easier to <b>control.</b> <b>Head</b> skis helped to popularize alpine skiing in the U.S.; the innovative equipment made turning significantly easier.|$|E
50|$|Quik-Call I is {{most famous}} {{for use in}} the fire service. The 1970s {{television}} show, Emergency!, depicted its use for base station ringdowns in the Los Angeles County Fire Department. In some systems, mobile radios had decoder options built into them. In Motorola mobile equipment, the decoders were housed in a box that bolted onto the radio <b>control</b> <b>head.</b> In the 1960s, it was also used to actuate tube-type receivers used to call out volunteer firefighters or to trigger sirens used to call out volunteers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} fully {{solid state}} mobile radios {{were used in}} the CTCSS conversion. They were 99-channel Midland radios. An early 1980s discovery was that users had to carry cards with lists of the channels. The radios had many channels and no alphanumeric display describing to whom one would talk when the display said channel [...] "65", for example. The Midland mobiles used flat, computer-hard-disk-style ribbon cable to connect the <b>control</b> <b>head</b> on the vehicle dashboard with the radio unit drawer. To improve reliability, some units used segments of discarded inch-and-a-half fire hose as a jacket to protect the easily abraded ribbon cable.|$|E

40|$|In {{homicide}} cases, suitcases provide concealment {{and ease}} of transport of a body and {{reduce the likelihood of}} detection. When estimating a minimum postmortem interval (mPMI), it is necessary to understand the taphonomic processes that occur when a body is concealed within a suitcase. In this study, the experimental carcasses consisted of pig (Sus scrofa Linnaeus) heads concealed within either hard shell or fabric suitcases whereas <b>control</b> pig <b>heads</b> were decomposed naturally. All <b>control</b> pigs <b>heads</b> attracted blowflies (Calliphoridae) immediately and mummified within days, whereas the experimental pigs heads had an oviposition delay of approximately 72 hours and decomposed resulting in skeletonization. Differences in the arthropod species present varied between the experimental and <b>control</b> pigs <b>heads.</b> Temperature comparisons revealed significant (p < 0. 001) differences between the experimental and <b>control</b> pigs <b>heads.</b> How a corpse decomposes when a suitcase is used for body disposal must be considered when estimating the mPMI...|$|R

50|$|An FAA study {{concluded}} that from May 1973 to April 1996 unapproved parts contributed to 174 aircraft accidents and minor incidents, causing 39 injuries and 17 fatalities. None of the involved accidents and incidents in the study involved major commercial airlines. Some critics, including William Cohen, {{a member of the}} U.S. Senate from Maine, argued that the FAA may have understated the role of unapproved parts of some accidents because the agency did not want to take the responsibility of regulating the aircraft parts industry. James Frisbee, who retired in 1992 as the quality <b>control</b> <b>head</b> of Northwest Airlines, argued that unapproved parts may have been a factor in more accidents than the numbers stated on U.S. federal accident and incident records.|$|E
5000|$|RPC Electronics, LLC {{created the}} RTrak and {{combined}} an OpenTracker 1+ and a GPS receiver {{along with a}} low power transmitter in one package. The original units produced 500 mW, but the current version puts out 350. The latest family of RTraks include the RTrak-Mini a smaller version of the original containing similar hardware, but an increase to a 5W transmitter, the RTrak-Lite {{which is the same}} size of the Mini, but doesn't contain a transmitter, allowing the end user to use the power they require and add on a receiver for channel detection. They also have the RTrak-HAB an APRS tracker designed specifically for high altitude applications, such as high altitude balloons. RPC Electronics also has a third-party interface for the Kenwood D710 APRS <b>control</b> <b>head.</b> This interface allows any FM transceiver to be connected to the D710 head and utilize the APRS functions.|$|E

5000|$|Sameen Shaw, a {{government}} assassin, and Michael Cole, a computer specialist/operative working for Special Counsel, neutralize a terrorist plot, acting on {{information from a}} Pentagon group called [...] "Research". Cole suspects that Research may sometimes be wrong, having found out from the Social Security number belonging to an electrical engineer they had previously killed that {{he was hired by}} the US government, not by terrorists. The Machine meanwhile gives their numbers to Reese and Finch, since their lives are now in danger. A hit team is sent by Special Counsel to eliminate Shaw and Cole, because Cole may have obtained information on the Machine. They kill Cole. Shaw escapes with help from Reese, whom she shoots, believing him to be another assassin. While on the run, Shaw is captured and tied up to be interrogated by Root, who believes she may hold the key to the Machine's location. Root leaves abruptly to avoid another hit team sent by Special Counsel. Just as the new hit team are about to kill Shaw, Reese saves her. He brings her to meet Finch, who explains that [...] "Research" [...] does not actually exist (implying it is, in fact, the Machine), and offers his aid to her. She refuses, so he offers her his card, which she looks at, but politely declines. She goes to confront whom she believes to be <b>Control</b> (<b>head</b> of the ISA's operations using the Machine) but ends up meeting Special Counsel, and surprisingly returns the flash drive to him with the information Cole had recovered, then kills the subordinate who had ordered her and Cole's death. Special Counsel allows her to leave, but later her old mentor (Hersh) surprises her on a crowded street, injecting her with poison. Leon Tao (disguised as a paramedic), Carter, and Fusco take charge of the apparently dead body and drive away. We learn in the next scene that Tao has, as directed by Reese, injected her with an antidote. Shaw, fully recovered after a sedative Tao had to give her, meets with Reese and Finch in a graveyard. While again refusing their aid, this time she accepts Finch's card.|$|E
40|$|Pediculosis capitis, {{infestation}} {{with head}} lice, {{is common in}} all human societies.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{are becoming a}} critical computational infrastructure, in which the communication between nodes needs {{to be protected from}} eavesdropping and tampering. Symmetric key cryptography is the fundamental technique being used. The protocols in this domain suffer from {{one or more of the}} problems of weak security guarantees if some nodes are compromised, lack of scalability, high energy overhead for key management and increased end-to-end data latency. In this paper, we propose a protocol called SECOS that mitigates these problems. SECOS divides the sensor field into control groups each with a <b>control</b> <b>head.</b> Data exchange between nodes within a control group happens through the mediation of the <b>control</b> <b>head</b> which provides the common key. The keys and the control heads are changed periodically to enhance security. SECOS enhances the survivability of the network by handling failures of control nodes. The experiments based on a simulation model show 7 times reduction in energy overhead and 50 % reduction in latency compared to the state-of-the-art protocol, SPINS. We also provide an analytical derivation of the optimal control group size that operates under the resource constraints and minimizes energy consumption...|$|E
