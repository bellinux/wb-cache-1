2500|$|Here’s an example: Suppose we {{see before}} us {{a parking lot}} full of {{hundreds}} of cars. We decide {{to go around the}} entire lot looking for: “Cars with flat (bad) tires”. After an hour or so we have found two “cars with bad tires.” We can now say with certainty that “Some <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> bad tires”. Or we could say: “It’s not true that ‘All the <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> good tires’”. Or: “It is true that: ‘not all the <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> good tires”. Let us go to another lot. Here we discover that “All the <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> good tires.” We might say, “There’s not a single instance of a <b>car</b> <b>having</b> a bad tire.” [...] Thus we see that, if we can say something about each car separately then we can say something about ALL of them collectively.|$|R
