We {{draw on the}} product design literature to propose a modular approach as a complementary perspective to conceptualizing <b>selection</b> <b>procedures.</b> A modular approach means that a product is broken down into its key underlying components. Therefore, we start by presenting a modular framework that identifies the important measurement components of <b>selection</b> <b>procedures.</b> Next, we adopt this modular lens for reviewing the available evidence regarding each of these components in terms of affecting validity, subgroup differences, and applicant perceptions, {{as well as for}} identifying new research directions.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{selecting}} the population {{with the largest}} mean from among k(> 2) independent populations is investigated. The population to be selected must {{be as good as}} or better than a control. It is assumed that past observations are available when the current selection is made. Accordingly, the empirical Bayes approach is employed. Combining useful information from the past data, empirical Bayes <b>selection</b> <b>procedures</b> are developed. ^ In Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, we consider k independent normal populations with normal prior distributions. A single-stage empirical Bayes <b>selection</b> <b>procedure</b> is developed in Chapter 2. Then, this single-stage empirical Bayes <b>selection</b> <b>procedure</b> is extended to a two-stage empirical Bayes <b>selection</b> <b>procedure</b> in Chapter 3. The empirical Bayes <b>selection</b> <b>procedures</b> are proved to be asymptotically optimal, having a rate of convergence of order O((ln n) 2 n), where n is the number of past observations at hand. ^ Chapter 4 deals with the problem of selection of the best from k independent Bernoulli populations. Here beta prior distributions are used. Two-stage empirical Bayes <b>selection</b> <b>procedures</b> are derived and studied. It is proved that the two-stage empirical Bayes <b>selection</b> <b>procedures</b> are asymptotically optimal, having a rate of convergence of order O((-cn)), where c is a positive constant and n is the number of past observations at hand. ^ Simulation studies are also carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed empirical Bayes <b>selection</b> <b>procedures</b> studied in Chapters 2, 3 and 4. These simulation studies were done for small to moderate values of n. The results indicate that the asymptotic optimal behavior of the <b>selection</b> <b>procedures</b> holds. ...|$|R
