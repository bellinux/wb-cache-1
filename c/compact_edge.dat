Throughout the experiment, the long ice edge between northwest Svalbard and central Greenland meandered; eddies were repeatedly formed, moved, and disappeared but the ice edge remained within a 100 -km-wide zone.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} a low cost, high gain, low {{cross-polar}} and <b>compact</b> <b>edge</b> feed printed elliptical antenna with a partial ground plane and parasitic patches is proposed and investigated. The proposed antenna is fabricated on a 1. 6 mm thick FR 4 substrate with dielectric constant of 4. 4 and loss tangent of 0. 025. The total planar {{area of the}} proposed antenna (L × W) is 28 × 24 mm 2. Both the simulated and experimental result shows that the proposed antenna provides a frequency range compatible with the ultra-wideband (UWB) standard, i. e., 3. 5 GHz– 12 GHz frequency band. The radiation pattern produced by the proposed antenna is approximately omnidirectional with inphase excitation of Surface waves resulting in less cross-polarization level (less than 20 dB) compared to its co-polar component for the entire impedance band width. The maximum measured gain for the fabricated antenna is around 6. 27 dBi with an average efficiency of above 90 % throughout the bandwidth. A linear phase response (phase of S 21) accompanied by a constant group delay of 1 ns throughout the measured bandwidth makes the proposed antenna {{a good candidate for}} UWB applications. 1...|$|E

40|$|Binary {{mixtures}} of quasi one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) trapped in deep optical lattices (OL) {{in the presence}} of periodic time modulations of the inter-species scattering length, are investigated. We adopt a mean field description and use the tight binding approximation and the averaging method to derive averaged model equations in the form of two coupled discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equations (DNLSE) with tunneling constants that nonlinearly depend on the inter-species coupling. We show that for strong and rapid modulations of the inter-species scattering length, the averaged system admits exact compacton solutions, e. g. solutions that have no tails and are fully localized on a compact which are achieved when the densities at the <b>compact</b> <b>edges</b> are in correspondence with zeros of the Bessel function (zero tunneling condition). Deviations from exact conditions give rise to the formation of quasi-compactons, e. g. non exact excitations which look as compactons for any practical purpose, for which the zero tunneling condition is achieved dynamically thanks to an effective nonlinear dispersive coupling induced by the scattering length modulation. Stability properties of compactons and quasi-compactons are investigated by linear analysis and by numerical integrations of the averaged system, respectively, and results compared with those from the original (unaveraged) system. In particular, the occurrence od delocalizing transitions with existence of thresholds in the mean inter-species scattering length is explicitly demonstrated. Under proper management conditions, stationary compactons and quasi-compactons are quite stable and robust excitations that can survive on very long time scale. A parameter design and a possible experimental setting for observation of these excitations are briefly discussed. Comment: 20 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

In conjunction with SAR imagery collected by the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center, the research vessel Hakon Mosby recorded meteorological data on station near the ice edge. The marginal ice zone was subjected to atmospheric and oceanographic forcing during the 7 - 16 January period which resulted in significant changes in ice edge morphology.

Then, an improved normalization algorithm for the selected feature values is designed to reduce the intra-class difference, while increasing the inter-class variability.

40|$|In September-October 2005, the {{juxtaposition}} of low-and high-pressure anomalies at 130 °W and 60 °W, respectively, created strong and persistent northerly airflow across the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). This had {{a major impact on}} regional sea ice conditions, with extreme ice compaction in the Bellingshausen and East Amundsen seas (60 °W- 130 °W) but divergence in the West Amundsen and East Ross seas. This resulted in the former in a highly compact marginal ice zone and ice cover, mean modeled ice thicknesses of > 5 m, and an earlier-than-average maximum extent (mid-August). While rapid ice retreat in late winter-spring created a major negative ice extent anomaly, compact ice persisted in the subsequent summer. Other effects were anomalies in air temperature (of + 1 °C to + 5 °C) and precipitation rates (to > 2. 5 mm/d). The patterns in late 2005 are consistent with the occurrence of a weak La Nina and a near-neutral Southern Annular Mode, with a quasi-stationary zonal wave three pattern dominating hemispheric atmospheric circulation.

40|$|Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) {{refers to}} a class of rapid {{manufacturing}} process that builds parts by incremental material deposition and fusion of thin 2 - 1 / 2 dimensional layers. Over this past decade, SFF has taken the manufacturing industry to new heights. However, parts produced by SFF processes exhibit a stair-step surface texture due {{to the presence of}} 2 - 1 / 2 dimensional layers and exhibit limited material properties. These issues are addressed by a modified SFF process called Shape Deposition Manufacturing. Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) is a novel layered manufacturing process in which multi-material structures with embedded components can be fabricated. In SDM, the layers are truly three dimensional in nature and are built using a combination of material addition and material removal processes. The need for an automated and robust process planner is more in the case of SDM as it attempts to build fully functional parts directly from CAD models. This thesis focuses on the process planning issues in Shape Deposition Manufacturing. The major issues in process planning for SDM involves the generation of 3 -D layers and generation of deposition and CNC cutter paths for these 3 -D layers. In SDM, the CAD model is decomposed into 3 -D layers of varying thickness based upon both geometric and material criteria. The layers are further decomposed into manufacturable volumes called <b>compacts.</b> Silhouette <b>edges</b> and silhouette loops are identified to help the decomposition of models into 3 -D layers and compacts.

In the <b>compact</b> state, the <b>edge</b> of the cellular structure aligns with the trailing edge {{of the rest of the}} blade. When the morphing cellular structure is in the extended state, the chord of that section of the blade is increased by 30 %. In transitioning from compact to extended states, the cellular structure slides along the ribs which define the boundaries of the morphing section in the spanwise direction. The cellular section has mini-spars running along the spanwise direc-tion to attach the flexible skin and provide stiffness against camber-like deformations due to aerodynamic loads. This article presents a finite element analysis and design of the morphing cellular structure, ensuring that the local strains in the elastic ligaments of the cellular structure do not exceed the maximum allowable, even as the section undergoes a large global strain.

In 2000, the two companies co-{{developed a}} 3 m Ka-band membrane reflect array antenna [42], as shown in Figure  7 (b). The horseshoe shaped frame consisted of one straight rigid tube, two straight tubes, and one semi-circular inflatable tube. The membrane could be rolled on the rigid tube to avoid creases. There were 16 catenary points distributed on the horseshoe shaped frame to apply stress on the membrane, and the surface flatness {{was measured to be}} ±  0.2 mm. In 2002, JPL proposed the idea of a “movie screen” membrane array antenna with a rectangular frame [44, 45], as shown in Figure  7 (c). The antenna feed was offset on the spacecraft, which eliminated the need for a feed-supporting tripod, resulting in a more <b>compact</b> structure. Two <b>edges</b> of the rectangular frame were inflatable tubes, and the other two edges were flat panels covered by roll-up shells, on which the membrane could be tightly rolled. Several cross bars, distributed uniformly on the membrane and employed as compression members to stretch the membrane, had no connection with the inflatable tubes. One constant force spring hung on each end of the cross bar and was connected to cables at the membrane edge. Similarly, some constant force springs hung on the flat panel and were connected to the cable. The membrane was deployed by the tubes inflating and was tensioned by constant force springs after deployment. From 2004 to 2008, JPL conducted a series of studies on “movie screen” antennas [46 – 48].
