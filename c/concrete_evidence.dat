5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the election, there was some {{violence}} and several incidents involving prominent opposition and media figures. In February, there was a grenade attack in Kigali which killed two people. Rwandan prosecutors blamed Kayumba Nyamwasa, a dissident General who had become a critic of Kagame. Nywamwasa fled to Johannesburg, South Africa, and in June he survived a shooting in the city. Nyamwasa alleged that it was an assassination attempt, a charge Rwanda denied. Days later, journalist Jean-Léonard Rugambage, who claimed to have uncovered the regime's responsibility in the attempted murder, was shot dead. In July, {{the vice president of the}} Democratic Green Party, André Kagwa Rwisereka, was beheaded in Butare.

5|$|The {{official}} rationale {{given by}} the military was that their actions had prevented an imminent Bolshevik coup, allegedly scheduled for 20 December. Martial law was declared. About 350 communists were arrested and four leaders (Karolis Požela, Juozas Greifenbergeris, Kazys Giedrys and Rapolas Čarnas) were executed on 29 December. This was a serious blow to the Communist Party of Lithuania and it was inactive for a time. No <b>concrete</b> <b>evidence</b> was ever found that the communists had planned any coups. Other political parties and organizations were not brutalized and, according to the military, no casualties {{were associated with the}} coup, apart from the four executions. However, other sources cite the case of Captain Vincas Jonuška, who was allegedly shot by the guards of the Presidential Palace, and died a day later in a hospital.|$|E
40|$|Concrete {{performance}} traditionally {{refers to}} compressive strength and workability. Recently, high performance <b>concrete</b> <b>evidenced</b> {{the possibility of}} enhancing other material properties. Among these, resistance to shrinkage cracking is gaining more attention among practitioners, due to its strict relation to durability requirements. Shrinkage cracks occur in restrained structures: for this reason, material characterisation should {{be made on the}} basis of a restrained shrinkage test. The ring test is an easy-to-use tool since one can measure the time-to-cracking of a concrete mix. Focus of this paper is to critically discuss the actual standard test procedure and then to propose enhancements of the test set-up with the aim of reducing the time-to-cracking and making the test duration more suitable for practical uses.

Second, what are the underlying causes behind this declining trend? In this article, based on Halliday’s systemic-functional grammar, esp. the idea about the construction of interpersonal meaning through mood structure, and Bakhtin’s dialogue theory, we did {{quantitative and qualitative analyses}} of the data selected from a Chinese dialect episode: Go! The Whole Family. The study reveals that the declining of the Chinese male’s authority in the family has become a publicly recognized convention, and this declining trend is not simply a social phenomenon, rather, it also reflects the universal human nature, that is, the pursuit of equality and humanism...|$|R

5|$|As Raskolnikov and Porfiry {{continue}} to meet, Raskolnikov's motives {{for the crime}} become exposed. Porfiry becomes increasingly certain of the man's guilt, but has no <b>concrete</b> <b>evidence</b> or witnesses with which to back up this suspicion. Furthermore, another man admits to committing the crime under questioning and arrest. However, Raskolnikov's nerves {{continue to}} wear thinner, and he is constantly struggling {{with the idea of}} confessing, though he knows that he can never be truly convicted. He turns to Sonya for support and confesses his crime to her. By coincidence, Svidrigaïlov has taken up residence in a room next to Sonya's and overhears the entire confession. When the two men meet face to face, Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, should he need to. Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dunya, Svidrigaïlov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife.|$|E
5|$|Grand Forks has {{an active}} sister city program {{designed}} to encourage cultural and economic exchanges. Grand Forks' first sister city was Ishim in the Soviet Union. The relationship with the Siberian city formally began in 1984 during the Cold War. Sometime in the late 1990s, however, political and economic turmoil in Russia ended the relationship. While the relationship with Ishim faded, Grand Forks found a new sister in Awano, Japan. An informal relationship began in 1994 when the school districts of both cities began exchanging students. In 1998, the two formally proclaimed themselves sister cities. The most <b>concrete</b> <b>evidence</b> {{of the relationship between}} the two is a Japanese rock garden in Grand Forks' Sertoma Park and a sculpture of an American bison in an Awano park. However, the annexation of Awano by the larger city of Kanuma has led to the end of the sister city relationship. Grand Forks' relationship with Dickinson, North Dakota, began in 2002, when delegations from each city visited the other. Grand Forks Mayor Michael Brown has said he thinks having friends in western North Dakota, which typically has diverging interests from eastern cities, could help at the state legislature. Sarpsborg, Norway, became a sister city in 2005 following several exchanges among leaders from both cities. The city became interested in building a relationship with Sarpsborg because many Grand Forks residents have Norwegian heritage.|$|E
30|$|Low plasma {{selenium}} {{levels are}} associated with an increasing risk of nosocomial infections [21]. Daily infusion of 1600  µg selenium following initial bolus dose of 2000  µg for 10  days was also {{found to be a}} novel therapy that increases Se status, improves illness severity, and lowers the incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) patients in ICU [10]. However, randomized trials and their pooled data involving parenteral selenium supplementation in critically ill patients with sepsis have yielded contradictory results [22 – 26]. Currently, we do not have <b>concrete</b> <b>evidences</b> that support the administration of selenium in septic patients. Therefore, doing trials that incorporated biomarkers to optimize treatment effects could build the bodies of literatures and help clinicians that need evidence-based medicine. We hypothesized selenium administration within the time frame of early goal-directed therapy in mechanically ventilated patients following sepsis (1) reduces 28 -day mortality by 20  % (2) reduces oxidative stress and inflammation (3) reduces ventilator-associated pneumonia.|$|R

5|$|Roman Catholics {{from the}} South Canara {{district}} on the south-western coast of India, {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Mangalore Diocese, are generally known as Mangalorean Catholics. They are Konkani people who speak the Konkani language. All earlier records of South Canara's Christians were lost at the time of their deportation by Tipu in 1784 and it is not known when Christianity was introduced in South Canara. It is possible that Syrian Christians settled in South Canara as they had in Malabar, a region south of Canara. During the 13thcentury Italian traveller Marco Polo recorded that there were considerable trading activities between the Red Sea and the Canara coast. Scholars have surmised that foreign Christian merchants were visiting the coastal towns of South Canara during that period for commerce, and that some Christian priests possibly accompanied them in their evangelical work. In 1321, the French Dominican friar Jordanus Catalani of Severac in south-western France, arrived in Bhatkal, North Canara. According to historian Severine Silva, no <b>concrete</b> <b>evidence</b> has yet been found that there were any permanent settlements of Christians in South Canara before the 16thcentury.|$|E
5|$|In {{trying to}} find a way to escape before the dome rises, Ryouta and Sakuya uncover records in the library {{mentioning}} a medical center that was shut down due to a fire, and that the ghostly Nageki, who Ryouta previously encountered, died in that fire. Sakuya deduces that an unused building on campus was the medical center and after investigating, they find its basement blocked off. They also encounter Anghel, who recalls the protagonist going into the infirmary the day before, contradicting Yuuya and Shuu's shared alibi. As Ryouta searches the infirmary for clues, he finds medical records for himself, the protagonist, Nageki, and Sakuya, but is knocked out immediately after. When he regains consciousness, he discovers the protagonist's bloody student ID—now with <b>concrete</b> <b>evidence,</b> Ryouta prepares to confront the doctor and Yuuya, only to find that Sakuya had left to do so alone. Ryouta returns to the infirmary as Yuuya shields Sakuya from Shuu's attempts to kill him; the doctor tells Ryouta that he will be waiting for him in the medical center's basement before escaping with Labor 9. Yuuya apologizes, affirming that while neither he nor Shuu killed the protagonist, they were the ones who dismembered her, and asks to speak to Sakuya alone. He reveals that they are full-blooded siblings, with Shuu using knowledge of Sakuya's true heritage to blackmail Yuuya into assisting him. Yuuya dies, Shuu's scalpel having been laced with the same neurotoxin that killed the headmaster, leaving Sakuya in a state of shock.|$|E

Additionally, these studies were failed to assess landscape and class level fragmentation, which have a bigger implication on ecological functioning and resiliency for change. More importantly, they did not assess landscape change under different institutional arrangements for natural resource management and yet not undertaken prediction works on how landscape change will unfold in the future at BER.
