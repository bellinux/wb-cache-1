500|$|A murderous and psychopathic {{criminal}} mastermind who portrays {{himself as}} an [...] "agent of chaos" [...] and rises to power by terrorizing Gotham and plunging it into anarchy. Before Ledger was confirmed for the role in July 2006, Paul Bettany, Lachy Hulme, Adrien Brody, Steve Carell, and Robin Williams publicly expressed interest in it. However, Nolan had {{wanted to work with}} Ledger on a number of projects in the past (including unsuccessfully approaching Ledger for the role of Batman in Batman Begins) and was agreeable to Ledger's chaotic interpretation of the character. When Ledger saw Batman Begins, he had realized a way to make the character work that was consistent with the film's tone: he described his Joker as a [...] "psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy." [...] In the film, the Joker has a Glasgow smile, and his trademark chalk-white skin and red lips are makeup rather than the result of <b>chemical</b> <b>bleaching,</b> as in the traditional portrayal of the character. Throughout the film, the Joker states his desire to upset social order through crime, and comes to define himself by his conflict with Batman. To prepare for the role, Ledger lived alone in a hotel room for a month, formulating the character's posture, voice, and personality, and kept a diary, in which he recorded the Joker's thoughts and feelings. While he initially found it difficult, Ledger eventually generated a voice unlike Jack Nicholson's character in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film. He was also given [...] and , which he [...] "really tried to read and put it down." [...] Ledger also cited A Clockwork Orange and Sid Vicious as [...] "a very early starting point for Christian [...] and I. But we kind of flew far away from that pretty quickly and into another world altogether." [...] "There's a bit of everything in him. There's nothing that consistent," [...] Ledger said, and added, [...] "There are a few more surprises to him." [...] Ledger was allowed to shoot and mostly direct the videos the Joker sends out as warnings. Each take Ledger made was different from the last. Nolan was impressed enough with the first video shoot that he chose to not be present when Ledger shot the video with a kidnapped reporter (Anthony Michael Hall). On January 22, 2008, after he had completed filming The Dark Knight, Ledger died of an accidental prescription drug overdose, leading to intense press attention and memorial tributes. [...] "It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day ," [...] Nolan recalled. [...] "But the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish." [...] All of Ledger's scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no [...] "digital effects" [...] to alter Ledger's actual performance posthumously. Nolan has dedicated the film in part to Ledger's memory.|$|E

For example, the DyP-type peroxidase MsP 1 from M. scorodonius (Scheibner et al. 2008), marketed as MaxiBright® (DSM, Heerlen, the Netherlands), is used to whiten whey for cheese production.

40|$|Abstract Kaolin is a rock {{composed}} {{mainly of}} kaolinite. It {{is used in}} many industrial segments, such as paper and ceramics. However, for these uses {{it is necessary to}} submit the ore to appropriate beneficiation, which generally involves magnetic separation and <b>chemical</b> <b>bleaching,</b> aiming to remove iron oxide and hydroxide, raising brightness index. This work reports the mineralogical characterization and analysis of the beneficiation of three samples of kaolin, two from Equador (Rio Grande do Norte - RN) and the third from Junco do Seridó (Paraíba - PB). The samples were submitted to granulometric classification in sieve of 44 μm, magnetic separation in a magnetic induction of 14000 gauss, and <b>chemical</b> <b>bleaching</b> with sodium dithionite during 240 min. The processes were divided into two beneficiation routes. X-ray diffraction, chemical analysis by X-ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy were used for mineralogical characterization of the ore and measurement of the brightness index, while electron paramagnetic resonance was applied to study the variation of iron oxides and hydroxides during beneficiation. The results indicate that just 30 min of <b>chemical</b> <b>bleaching</b> without magnetic separation was sufficient to increase the brightness index from 78. 2 to 90. 2 % and from 91. 3 to 95. 7 % in the two samples from Equador (RN) and from 86. 9 to 90. 4 % in the sample from Junco do Seridó (PB). The magnetic separation, although causing a small increase in the brightness index, was inefficient for removal of iron oxides and hydroxides. The results indicated no need for using magnetic separation in plants for beneficiation of kaolin from these two locations, providing the reduction of production costs allowing better exploitation of the ore...|$|E

40|$|The {{effluent}} from pulp bleaching processes containing chlorinated lignin and degraded polyphenolic intermediates {{remains as}} {{a major source of}} water pollution from the pulp and paper industries. Alternative elemental chlorine free bleaching methods based on the usage of chlorine dioxide, ozone and hydrogen peroxide are potential substitutes. Bio-bleaching methods, which involve pre-treatment of pulp with microbial enzymes such as xylanases, have emerged as viable options. Investigations reported in this paper aim at exploring the suitability of commercial bacterial zylanase enzyme preparations for bio-bleaching of bagasse pulps in conjunction with specific chemical bleach sequences employing hydrogen peroxide (P), alkali extraction (E), ozonation (Z), hypochlorite (H) and chelation (Q) stages' The effluent profiles and pulp qualities obtained for each of the bleach combinations (involving bio-bleaching and <b>chemical</b> <b>bleaching</b> sequences) were monitored. Analysis of the results clearly indicates that the inclusion of enzyme pretreatment with the TCF (total chlorine free) and ECF (elemental chlorine free) sequences has a significant effect on the effluent (COD, lignin and colour) and pulp quality (kappa number,. brightness) parameters.

Surface modification of nano kaoline about the intercalation process involved the insertion of low molecular weight organic regents included guest molecules (urea, formamide, potassium acetate and dimethysulfoxide) between layers consisting of two-dimensional arrangements of tetrahedral and octahedral sheets [88]. Indeed, intercalation not only enhances the possibilities of kaoline exfoliation as nanostructured mineral, but also modifies the nano kaoline surface via complexation of H 2 bonding [89]. The formation of intercalates happens when the organic material located and stacked between kaolinite layers. <b>Chemical</b> <b>bleaching</b> is a standard beneficial technique used to enhance the brightness of nano kaoline for high value applications [86]. The process discolors the nano kaoline and allows the small proportion of total iron removal in solution.
