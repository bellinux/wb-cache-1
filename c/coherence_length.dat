5|$|The Twyman–Green {{interferometer}}, {{invented by}} Twyman and Green in 1916, is {{a variant of}} the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. It {{is interesting to note that}} Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited <b>coherence</b> <b>length.</b> Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig.14 illustrates a Twyman-Green interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.|$|E
5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E
25|$|The length {{over which}} the phase in {{a beam of light}} is correlated, is called the <b>coherence</b> <b>length.</b> In order for {{interference}} to occur, the path length difference must be smaller than the <b>coherence</b> <b>length.</b> This is sometimes referred to as spectral coherence, as it is related to the presence of different frequency components in the wave. In the case of light emitted by an atomic transition, the <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> is related to the lifetime of the excited state from which the atom made its transition.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, the superconducting {{length scales}} show similar anisotropy, in both {{penetration}} depth (λab ≈ 150nbsp&nm, λc ≈ 800nbsp&nm) and <b>coherence</b> <b>length,</b> (ξab ≈ 2nbsp&nm, ξc ≈ 0.4nbsp&nm). Although the <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> in the a-b plane is 5 {{times greater than}} that along the c axis it is quite small compared to classic superconductors such as niobium (where ξ ≈ 40nbsp&nm). This modest <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> means that the superconducting state is more susceptible to local disruptions from interfaces or defects {{on the order of}} a single unit cell, such as the boundary between twinned crystal domains. This sensitivity to small defects complicates fabricating devices with YBCO, and the material is also sensitive to degradation from humidity.|$|E
25|$|When {{the wave}} {{front of the}} emitted beam has perturbations, only the {{transverse}} <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> (where the wave front perturbation is less than 1/4 of the wavelength) {{should be considered as}} a Gaussian beam diameter when determining the divergence of the laser beam. If the transverse <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> in the vertical direction is higher than in horizontal, the laser beam divergence will be lower in the vertical direction than in the horizontal.|$|E
25|$|If {{waves are}} emitted from an {{extended}} source, this {{can lead to}} incoherence in the transversal direction. When looking at a cross section of a beam of light, the length over which the phase is correlated is called the transverse <b>coherence</b> <b>length.</b> In the case of Young's double slit experiment, this would mean that if the transverse <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> is smaller than the spacing between the two slits, the resulting pattern on a screen would look like two single slit diffraction patterns.|$|E

40|$|Wall {{pressure}} data acquired during {{flight tests}} at several flight conditions are analysed and the correlation and <b>coherence</b> <b>lengths</b> {{of the data}} reported. It is found that the correlation and <b>coherence</b> <b>lengths</b> {{are influenced by the}} origin of the structure producing the pressure and the frequency bandwidth over which the analyses are performed. It is shown how the frequency bandwidth biases the correlation length and how the convection of the pressure field might reduce the coherence measured between sensors. A convected form of the cross correlation and cross spectrum is introduced to compensate for the effects of convection. <b>Coherence</b> <b>lengths</b> measured in the streamwise direction appear much longer than expected. Coherent structures detected using the convected cross correlation do not exhibit an exponential coherent power decay...|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{particles}} like electrons, neutrons and atoms, the <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> {{is related to the}} spatial extent of the wave function that describes the particle.|$|E
25|$|However, {{since the}} average domain size {{generally}} {{is larger than}} the <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> of the probing electrons, interference between electrons scattered from different domains can be neglected. Therefore, the total LEED pattern emerges as the incoherent sum of the diffraction patterns associated with the individual domains.|$|E
25|$|OCT {{is based}} on low-coherence interferometry. In {{conventional}} interferometry with long <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> (i.e., laser interferometry), interference of light occurs over a distance of meters. In OCT, this interference is shortened to a distance of micrometers, owing {{to the use of}} broad-bandwidth light sources (i.e., sources that emit light over a broad range of frequencies). Light with broad bandwidths can be generated by using superluminescent diodes or lasers with extremely short pulses (femtosecond lasers).

40|$|Predictions of {{the wall}} {{pressure}} in the turbulent boundary of an aerospace vehicle can differ substantially from measurement due to phenomena that are not well understood. Characterizing the phenomena will require additional testing at considerable cost. Before expending scarce resources, it is desired to quantify {{the effect of the}} uncertainty in wall pressure predictions and measurements on structural response and acoustic radiation. A sensitivity analysis is performed on four parameters of the Corcos cross spectrum model: power spectrum, streamwise and cross stream <b>coherence</b> <b>lengths</b> and Mach number.

25|$|In {{time domain}} OCT the {{pathlength}} of the reference arm is varied in time (the reference mirror is translated longitudinally). A property of low coherence interferometry is that interference, i.e. {{the series of}} dark and bright fringes, is only achieved when the path difference lies within the <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> of the light source. This interference is called auto correlation in a symmetric interferometer (both arms have the same reflectivity), or cross-correlation in the common case. The envelope of this modulation changes as pathlength difference is varied, where {{the peak of the}} envelope corresponds to pathlength matching.|$|E
25|$|In 1902–1906, Dayton Miller {{repeated}} the Michelson–Morley experiment together with Edward W. Morley. They confirmed the null {{result of the}} initial experiment. However, in 1921–1926, Miller conducted new experiments which apparently gave positive results. Those experiments initially attracted some attention {{in the media and}} in the scientific community but have been considered refuted for the following reasons: Einstein, Max Born, and Robert S. Shankland pointed out that Miller hadn't appropriately considered the influence of temperature. A modern analysis by Roberts shows that Miller's experiment gives a null result, when the technical shortcomings of the apparatus and the error bars are properly considered. Additionally, Miller's result is in disagreement with all other experiments, which were conducted before and after. For example, Georg Joos (1930) used an apparatus of similar dimensions to Miller's, but he obtained null results. In recent experiments of Michelson–Morley type where the <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> is increased considerably by using lasers and masers the results are still negative.|$|E
25|$|The {{incoming}} beam {{is shaped}} by slits of a few tens of micrometers such that the transverse <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> {{is greater than the}} grating period. The interferometer consists of three parallel and equally spaced phase gratings, and an x-ray camera. The incident beam is diffracted by a first grating of period 2P into two beams. These are further diffracted by a second grating of period P into four beams. Two of the four merge at a third grating of period 2P. Each is further diffracted by the third grating. The multiple diffracted beams are allowed to propagate for sufficient distance such that the different diffraction orders are separated at the camera. There exists a pair of diffracted beams that co-propagate from the third grating to the camera. They interfere with each other to produce intensity fringes if the gratings are slightly misaligned with each other. The central pair of diffraction paths are always equal in length regardless of the x-ray energy or the angle of the incident beam. The interference patterns from different photon energes and incident angles are locked in phase.|$|E

The exciton <b>coherence</b> <b>lengths</b> in SWNTs {{are of the}} order of 10 nm, as deduced from the experimentally obtained radiative lifetimes, and they are about ten times larger than the exciton Bohr radius along the tube axis...|$|R
50|$|Monochromatic {{sources are}} usually lasers; such high monochromaticity implies long <b>coherence</b> <b>lengths</b> (up to {{hundreds}} of meters). For example, a stabilized and monomode helium-neon laser can easily produce light with <b>coherence</b> <b>lengths</b> of 300 m. Not all lasers are monochromatic, however (e.g. for a mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser, Δλ ≈ 2 nm - 70 nm). LEDs are characterized by Δλ ≈ 50 nm, and tungsten filament lights exhibit Δλ ≈ 600 nm, so these sources have shorter coherence times than the most monochromatic lasers.|$|R

25|$|Neutrino {{oscillation}} {{arises from}} a mixture between the flavor and mass eigenstates of neutrinos. That is, the three neutrino states that {{interact with the}} charged leptons in weak interactions are each a different superposition of the three neutrino states of definite mass. Neutrinos are created in weak processes in their flavor eigenstates. As a neutrino propagates through space, the quantum mechanical phases of the three mass states advance at slightly different rates due to the slight differences in the neutrino masses. This results in a changing mixture of mass states as the neutrino travels, but a different mixture of mass states corresponds to a different mixture of flavor states. So a neutrino born as, say, an electron neutrino will be some mixture of electron, mu, and tau neutrino after traveling some distance. Since the quantum mechanical phase advances in a periodic fashion, after some distance the state will nearly return to the original mixture, and the neutrino will be again mostly electron neutrino. The electron flavor content of the neutrino will then continue to oscillate {{as long as the}} quantum mechanical state maintains coherence. Since mass differences between neutrino flavors are small in comparison with long <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> for neutrino oscillations this microscopic quantum effect becomes observable over macroscopic distances.|$|E
500|$|A {{method of}} {{establishing}} precise geodetic baselines, invented by Yrjö Väisälä, exploited the low <b>coherence</b> <b>length</b> of white light. Initially, white light was split in two, with the reference beam [...] "folded", bouncing back-and-forth six times between a mirror pair spaced precisely 1 m apart. Only if the test path was precisely 6 times the reference path would fringes be seen. Repeated applications {{of this procedure}} allowed precise measurement of distances up to 864 meters. Baselines thus established were used to calibrate geodetic distance measurement equipment, leading to a metrologically traceable scale for geodetic networks measured by these instruments. (This method has been superseded by GPS.) ...|$|E
500|$|Michelson and Morley (1887) {{and other}} early experimentalists using {{interferometric}} techniques {{in an attempt}} to measure the properties of the luminiferous aether, used monochromatic light only for initially setting up their equipment, always switching to white light for the actual measurements. The reason is that measurements were recorded visually. Monochromatic light would result in a uniform fringe pattern. Lacking modern means of environmental temperature control, experimentalists struggled with continual fringe drift even though the interferometer might be set up in a basement. Since the fringes would occasionally disappear due to vibrations by passing horse traffic, distant thunderstorms and the like, it would be easy for an observer to [...] "get lost" [...] when the fringes returned to visibility. The advantages of white light, which produced a distinctive colored fringe pattern, far outweighed the difficulties of aligning the apparatus due to its low <b>coherence</b> <b>length.</b> This was an early example of the use of white light to resolve the [...] "2pi ambiguity".|$|E

500|$|The Mach–Zehnder {{interferometer}} is a {{more versatile}} instrument than the Michelson interferometer. Each of the well separated light paths is traversed only once, and the fringes can be adjusted {{so that they are}} localized in any desired plane. Typically, the fringes would be adjusted to lie in the same plane as the test object, so that fringes and test object can be photographed together. If it is decided to produce fringes in white light, then, since white light has a limited <b>coherence</b> <b>length,</b> on the order of micrometers, great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible. [...] As illustrated in Fig.6, a compensating cell would be placed {{in the path of the}} reference beam to match the test cell. Note also the precise orientation of the beam splitters. The reflecting surfaces of the beam splitters would be oriented so that the test and reference beams pass through an equal amount of glass. In this orientation, the test and reference beams each experience two front-surface reflections, resulting in the same number of phase inversions. The result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference.|$|E
