5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} {{selectively}} bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability. The {{appearance of the}} cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics. Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage. Scientific research into the genetic modification of B.oleracea crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance. Genetically modified B.oleracea crops are not currently used in <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of lettuce}} {{over the centuries}} has resulted in several changes through selective breeding: delayed bolting, larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower latex content, and different leaf shapes and colors. Work in these areas continues through the present day. Scientific research into the genetic modification of lettuce is ongoing, with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and United States to test modifications allowing greater herbicide tolerance, greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower bolting patterns. However, genetically modified lettuce is not currently used in <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture.</b>|$|E

25|$|Banana {{cultivation}} {{also proved}} {{a boon to}} the region’s economy after the 1880s, expanding <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture</b> and inducing thousands more to migrate. By the early twentieth century, the United Fruit Company operated a string of banana ports, including Puerto Limon (Costa Rica) and Bocas del Toro (Panama).|$|E
25|$|In particular, {{wood from}} {{tropical}} rainforests is rarely harvested for paper {{because of their}} heterogeneity. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat, the overwhelming direct cause of deforestation is subsistence farming (48% of deforestation) and <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture</b> (32%), which is linked to food, not paper production.|$|E

25|$|Philippines is a {{destination}} country {{in addition to}} being source country. Migrants from several countries looking for work are attracted to Thailand’s promising economy.

25|$|The South Region has a {{fair amount}} of industry, its main {{commerce}} consisting of logging, timber, mining, and offshore oil drilling. <b>Commercial</b> <b>agriculture</b> is also important in the South, the major cash crops being cocoa and rubber. Cattle rearing and fishing are significant economic components, as well. Much of the population is made up of subsistence farmers.|$|E
25|$|The {{raising of}} European {{foodstuffs}} such as wheat and sheep began early with <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture</b> becoming {{the basis of}} the economy by 1550.

25|$|Belize aims {{to stimulate}} the growth of <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture</b> through CARICOM.

25|$|However, {{efforts to}} develop <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture</b> met with limited success, in part because much of Haiti's labor force was {{employed}} as seasonal workers in the more-established sugar industries of Cuba and the Dominican Republic. An estimated 30,000-40,000 Haitian laborers, known in Cuba as braceros, went annually to the Oriente Province between 1913 and 1931. Many Haitians continued to resent the loss of sovereignty.|$|E

Deeply held principles of freedom, equality, and autonomy, as expressed in Republican values appeared threatened, especially during the 1850s, by the relentless expansion of market relations and <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture.</b> Alabamians were thus, he judged, prepared to believe the worst once Lincoln was elected.|$|E

25|$|Between 1870 and 1914, {{more than}} 3.6 million people {{departed}} from Polish territories (of whom 2.6 million {{arrived in the}} U.S.) Serfdom was abolished in Prussia in 1808, in the Austria–Hungary in 1848 and in the Russian Empire, in 1861. In the late 19th century, the beginnings of industrialization, <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture</b> and a population boom, that exhausted available land, transformed Polish peasant-farmers into migrant-laborers. Racial discrimination and unemployment drove them to emigrate.|$|E
25|$|Under the Conservatives, {{the high}} world price {{of silver and}} {{increased}} production of copper, lead, zinc, and tin combined to create a period of relative prosperity. The Conservative governments encouraged the mining industry {{through the development of}} a rail network to the Pacific coast. The growth of <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture,</b> such as the development of Bolivia's natural rubber resources, also contributed to a stronger economy. Agricultural production in the highlands increased as the haciendas expanded in some regions.|$|E
25|$|The Bajío, a rich, fertile lowland {{just north}} of central Mexico, was {{nonetheless}} a frontier region between the densely populated plateaus and valleys of Mexico's center and south and the harsh northern desert controlled by nomadic Chichimeca. Devoid of settled indigenous populations in the early sixteenth century, the Bajío did not initially attract Spaniards, who were {{much more interested in}} exploiting labor and collecting tribute whenever possible. The region did not have indigenous populations that practiced subsistence agriculture. The Bajío developed in the colonial period as a region of <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture.</b>|$|E

25|$|The first {{successful}} English colony, Jamestown, {{was established in}} 1607 on the James River in Virginia. Jamestown languished for decades until {{a new wave of}} settlers arrived in the late 17th century and established <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture</b> based on tobacco. Between the late 1610s and the Revolution, the British shipped an estimated 50,000 to 120,000 convicts to their American colonies. A severe instance of conflict was the 1622 Powhatan uprising in Virginia in which Native Americans killed hundreds of English settlers. The largest conflicts between Native Americans and English settlers in the 17th century were King Philip's War in New England and the Yamasee War in South Carolina.|$|E
25|$|Without {{adequate}} roads, {{the regions}} of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hard woods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture,</b> the hacienda as the dominant social unit, {{and the majority of}} the population living at a subsistence level. In the Cibao Valley, the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the Brisbane Showgrounds, or Exhibition Grounds, in 1876, the site was part of the Queensland Acclimatisation Society's grounds. In July 1863 this Society, established in 1862 to promote the introduction, acclimatization, propagation and distribution in Queensland of economically useful plants and animals, was granted 33 acres of land bounded by Bowen Bridge Road, O'Connell Terrace, Brookes Street and Gregory Terrace. At the northwestern corner of the site, fronting Bowen Bridge Road and O'Connell Terrace, the Society established a public exhibition garden Bowen Park. The remainder of the site was used for experimentation purposes, growing and propagating plants and seeds sent from other parts of Queensland, other colonies and around the world, and raising various introduced animals. The Society {{played an important role in}} the beginnings of <b>commercial</b> <b>agriculture</b> in Queensland, introducing or trialling crops and plants such as mango trees, ginger plants, sugar cane, olive trees and choko vines.|$|E
