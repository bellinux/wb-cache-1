40|$|The {{uncertainty}} of a rotating coil transducer for magnetic field mapping is analyzed. Unscented transform and statistical {{design of experiments}} are combined to determine magnetic field expectation, standard uncertainty, and separate contributions of the uncertainty sources. For nonlinear measurement models, the unscented transform-based approach is more error-proof than the linearization underlying the “Guide to the expression of Uncertainty in Measurements” (GUMs), owing {{to the absence of}} model approximations and derivatives computation. When GUM assumptions are not met, the deterministic sampling strategy strongly reduces computational burden with respect to Monte Carlo-based methods proposed by the Supplement 1 of the GUM. Furthermore, the design of experiments and the associated statistical analysis allow the uncertainty sources domain to be explored efficiently, as well as their significance and single contributions to be assessed for an effective setup configuration.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a new {{interdisciplinary}} methodology and software tools realized and configured for the analysis and optimization of the heteropolar radial Active Magnetic Bearing (AMB) construction. Due to several possible AMB configurations for the particular application, the designer needs to be supported by modelling and simulation tools at the decision stage. The designed software model of AMB accelerates the prototype design and minimizes its initial costs. In this paper the proposed solution and software environment are discussed together with its advantages and disadvantages. The analytical calculations of the AMB stator geometry are used as a starting point for the optimization procedure. The geometry constraints along with the AMB operational parameters are formulated. The AMB stator is characterized by many dimensions defining the magnetic field path, which are the pole width, the pole height, the stator radiuses: the external, internal and the rotor side. The coils are represented by closed shapes located at the pole sides. In the <b>coil</b> <b>area</b> a current density is defined and used in the optimization process. The AMB performance and parameters strongly depend on the air gap size which could be selected manually or fitted automatically due to the rotor size and weight. The electromagnetic force generated by the proposed stator geometry depends on the rotor-bearing air gap. For the proposed parametric description of the AMB geometry the choice of optimization strategy is studied to satisfy the selected quality criterion. To simplify calculations a quarter of the AMB construction is under consideration. The designed construction variants and examples of optimization are presented...|$|E
40|$|Humidification-dehumidification is a {{promising}} technology for decentralized, small-scale desalination, but high energy consumption and large dehumidifier size are disadvantages. Direct-contact dehumidification in bubble columns {{has previously been}} shown to decrease dehumidifier volume by an order of magnitude. In a bubble column dehumidifier, warm, moist air is bubbled though a column of fresh water cooled by heat exchange with seawater feed. The concentration gradient from the warm bubble center to the cool bubble surface drives radial mass diffusion, and water vapor condenses {{on the surface of}} the bubble. In this paper, a parallel-flow effectiveness is defined to complement heat flux when assessing the performance of a single-stage bubble column dehumidifier. A bubble column dehumidifier is tested using significantly smaller cooling coils than those tested in previous work. Experimental results are presented in terms of heat flux and effectiveness in order to better understand the factors influencing bubble column dehumidifier performance. It is found that the heat flux can be raised dramatically by reducing the <b>coil</b> <b>area,</b> but that this gain is accompanied by a loss of effectiveness. Increasing air temperature leads to increased heat flux but decreased effectiveness. Because the gas-side pressure drop increases with increasing column liquid height, significantly lower column liquid heights are tested than those used in previous work. The critical liquid height is found to be below 4 cm for the sparger and flow rate tested. Additional heat transfer in the air gap is explored, but found to be minimal for well-designed columns with low temperature pinch.

40|$|Heat {{and mass}} {{transfer}} processes governing {{the performance of}} bubble dehumidifier trays are studied {{in order to develop}} a predictive model and design rules for efficient and economical design of bubble column dehumidifiers for humidification-dehumidification (HDH) systems. As a result of their high heat transfer coefficients and large interfacial areas, bubble columns are an inexpensive and compact solution for dehumidification in HDH, which has promising applications in small-scale desalination and industrial water remediation. Performance parameters for dehumidifier design for HDH, including a device-specific parallel-flow effectiveness, are explained. A new model for the performance of single bubble trays is developed based on the rapid mixing in the column and the approximation of negligible gas-side resistance. An experiment is performed to measure the heat transfer coefficients outside cooling coils in shallow bubble columns, in which geometric parameters including liquid height and cylinder diameter, height, and horizontal position relative to the sparger orifices are varied. The highest heat transfer coefficients are recorded on cylinders placed in the coalescing region and directly above the sparger orifices. Heat flux and parallel-flow effectiveness of a bubble column dehumidifier are investigated experimentally to validate the model, which predicts the heat transfer rate well with an average absolute error of < 3 %. The independence of heat flux and effectiveness from liquid depth supports the assumption of negligible gas-side resistance to heat and mass transfer. Despite the mass exchange, the bubble column dehumidifier performs like a typical heat exchanger: the heat flux decreases and effectiveness increases with increasing <b>coil</b> <b>area.</b> The results of this study enable modeling and design of bubble column dehumidifiers for high heat recovery and low capital cost. by Emily Winona Tow.

HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R original equipment manufacturers have followed their lead and recently started using microchannel condensers in residential and commercial cooling and heat pump applications.

The main difference between microchannel condensers used for the automotive and residential / commercial applications is that the latter span a much wider range of <b>coil</b> face <b>areas</b> compared to the former.

40|$|Purpose This {{paper is}} aimed at general {{investigation}} of winding topologies for flux-switching motors (FSM) with various segment-tooth combinations and different excitation methods. Design/methodology/approach For the ac winding of FSM, two winding topologies, namely the concentrated winding and the distributed winding, are compared {{in terms of the}} winding factor and efficiency. For the field winding of dc-excited FSM (DCEFSM), another two winding topologies, namely the lap winding and the toroidal winding, are compared in terms of effective <b>coil</b> <b>area,</b> end-winding length, and thermal conditions. Analytical derivation is used for the general winding factor calculation. The calculation results are validated using finite element analysis (FEA). Findings Winding factors can be used as an indication of winding efficiency for FSMs {{in the same manner as}} done for synchronous motors (SMs). For FSMs with concentrated windings, the winding factor increases when the rotor tooth number approaches a multiple of the stator segment number. For FSMs with certain segment-tooth combinations, e. g. 6 / 8, the theoretical maximum winding factor can be achieved by implementing distributed windings. Furthermore, the toroidal winding can be an efficient winding topology for DCEFSMs with large stator diameter and small stack length. Research limitations/implications This work can be continued with investigating the variation of reluctance torque with respect to different segment-tooth combinations of FSM. Originality/value This paper proposes a general method to calculate the winding factor of flux-switching motors using only the phase number, the stator segment number, the rotor tooth number, and the skew angle. Using this method, a table of winding factors of FSMs with different segment-tooth combinations is provided. Principle of design of FSMs with high winding factors are hence concluded. This paper also proposed the implementation of distributed windings for FSM with certain segment-tooth combinations, e. g. 6 / 8, by which means a theoretical maximum winding factor is achieved. In addition, different winding topologies for the field winding of DCEFSM are also investigated...|$|E
40|$|Energy is an {{essential}} and critical commodity and our reliance on it has fuelled much of the debate and interest in society and academia alike. Environmental concerns, depleted energy resources and higher energy prices are the main factors that drive this interest. Energy efficiency {{is one of the}} main avenues to preserve and better utilize this valuable commodity. The energy exchange by employment of heat exchangers is extensive and tube-fin heat exchangers are widely used in industrial and commercial applications. Smarter designs could not only improve energy efficiency but may also save on material costs. Although mass production and improved manufacturing techniques have reduced manufacturing costs, tube fin heat exchangers have not evolved greatly to take advantage of these improvements. There has been a large range of fin surface enhancements proposed, such as waffled fins or louvres and while limited improvements in capacity have been achieved, this is generally accomplished at a much larger pressure drop penalty. Numerous studies have been performed in order to examine the potential of various surface enhancement geometries on an ad hoc basis. These presumably operate on the basis of enhanced convection due to increased turbulence levels. However very few of these studies examine the actual nature of turbulence that is responsible for convection enhancement. A series of experiments and numerical studies have been conducted to quantify the effect of the turbulence vortex characteristics on the air side heat convection of a tube-fin heat exchanger. Homogeneous, transverse and streamwise vortical structures were investigated. The thermal transfer performance resulting from these flows was compared to that of standard louver fin geometries by considering sensible heat transfer only, applicable to radiator applications. Several novel coils designed to achieve these vortex structures, were developed and their heat transfer characteristics were quantified. These coil designs can be described as the Tube Mesh, Tube Strut and a Delta-Winglet fin surface. The Tube Mesh heat exchanger consisted entirely of horizontal and vertical tubes arranged in an approximate homogeneous turbulence generating grid. While they had a lower heat transfer of between 53 % to 63 % of that of the louvre fin surface, they had an extremely low pressure drop of 25 % to 33 %. This has the potential to make them suitable for certain low pressure drop applications, especially if energy saving is a prerequisite. The range of Tube Strut coils consisted of a tube bundle with interconnecting heat conducting struts to form a parallel plate array were also investigated. Three different strut thicknesses and strut spacing were trialled. In general these had similar performance to the tube mesh at 45 % to 65 % the heat transfer capacity of the louver fin surface. The resulting pressure drop was 38 % to 42 % of that of the louver fin surface. A delta-winglet design which positioned the deltas in a flow up configuration just in front of the tubes was examined. It was found that this configuration had an almost comparable capacity of 87 % to a louver surface having the same fin pitch. On the other hand it had approximately half the pressure drop of 54 % of the similar louver fin surface. This particularly low pressure drop makes this design preferable from an energy utilisation perspective. While a slight increase in <b>coil</b> <b>area</b> is required, this is offset by an almost 50 % reduction in operating costs by reducing the parasitic energy requirements of the convection fans. The experimental data gathered for this Delta-Winglet design served to validate a succession of numerical simulations which were performed to estimate the performance of other configurations of multiple vortex generators. In addition the performance of combining a delta-wing with a louvred surface was investigated. It was found that increasing the number of delta-winglets or combining deltas with a louvred surface provided little improvement in heat transfer but increased pressure drop substantially. The louvre design itself was examined, and simulations were undertaken to estimate the effect of louvre angle, as well as louvre pitch. A hitherto unexamined concept was to investigate the effect of having louvres with serrated edges. It was found that an increase in louver angle by 5 degrees had negligible effect on heat transfer but increased the pressure drop by 17 %. A variation in louver pitch showed a minimal variation in both heat transfer and pressure drop. Surprisingly a serrated louver showed a slight reduction in both heat transfer and pressure drop but this was miniscule. It was established throughout the course of the investigations that the bulk of the coil heat transfer is performed by the first tube row. Therefore the potential for increasing heat transfer by shifting some heat exchange to the down stream rows was examined. This was attempted by having progressively increasing louvre angles from the front of the coil to the rear. While a slight increase in heat transfer performance was achieved, this accomplished at the expense of a 13 %- 14 % increase in pressure drop. The outcomes have shown that substantial net improvement of heat exchanger energy efficiency can be achieved through optimization of the turbulence generation along the fins of a tube fin heat exchanger.

Standard multiobjective optimization algorithms can then be used for extremely fast evaluation of the trade-offs among the various optimization targets and exploration of the Pareto frontier. The error caused by model assumptions are estimated by Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations to be below a few percent points from the exact solution...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work {{characteristics}} {{and performance of}} a natural vacuum desalination system using low grade heat source is studied numerically and experimentally. In the numerical work, a program to solve the governing equations in forward time step marching technique is developed. In the experimental work a lab scale natural vacuum system using electric heater as a heat source is designed and tested. The surface area of seawater in the evaporator is 0. 5 m. The numerical and experimental results show a good agreement. By using numerical simulations effect operating conditions such as heat source temperature, condenser temperature, heating <b>coil</b> surface <b>area,</b> and the present of heat recovery unit are explored. The simulation showed that, the present system with evaporator surface area of 0. 2 m 2, operation time of 9 h and source temperature of 80 °C will produce 6. 63 L of fresh water ant thermal efficiency is 70. 4 %. The main conclusion can be drawn {{here is that the}} performance of the natural vacuum desalination system is mainly affected by maximum temperature in evaporator and minimum temperature in condenser. On the other hand, the surface <b>area</b> of heating <b>coil</b> and the heat recovery unit showed only a small effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to evaluate the feasibility and clinical use of time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the lower extremity compared to intraar-terial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA). Twenty-two patients suffering from peripheral arterial occlusive disease underwent MRA and IA-DSA. MRA examinations were performed on a 1. 5 T system equipped with a 4 -element-array <b>coil.</b> The <b>area</b> from the distal abdominal aorta to the distal lower limb was covered by 2 – 3 examination steps. A T 1 -weighted gradient echo sequence with a temporal resolution of 7 – 10 s was used. Single-dose contrast material (0. 1 mm/kg) was injected with a flow rate of 2 mL/s, followed by a 40 mL saline flush. Pre and post contrast images were subtracted, and the subtracted data set was postprocessed with maximum intensity projection (MIP). In all patients diagnostic images could be obtained. Problems with venous overlay or incomplete arterial filling were not present. Sensitivity {{for the detection of}} relevant stenoses (> 50 %) was 96. 7 %, specificity was 97 %. Concerning the detection of occlusions, sensitivity was 97. 8 %, specificity was 99. 2 %. Time-resolved contrast-enhanced MRA of the lower extremity is a robust procedure with high accuracy in the detection of relevant stenoses and occlusions...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{technology}} {{is the development of}} technology that is needed currently given the technological advances in electronic devices very rapidly. Every electronic devices certainly require electric power and cable as the conductor. Therefore, if there is a tool that can transfer electric power without wires, it would be more easy for the user to use the electronic devices. Transfer of electrical energy wireless has several advantages over using a cable that can increase comfort in the use of electrical equipment and can reduce the amount of electronic waste.. The method used for wireless energy transfer in this paper uses an resonance techniques inductive electromagnetic field. User create two shaped copper solenoid coils used to generate the mutual inductance. Wireless electrical energy transfer circuit consists of two circuits that the transmitter and receiver circuit. Transmitter circuit consists of a series LC oscillation and receiver circuit is a merger several electronic components. Realization tool works well with setting the appropriate components. However, the effect of distance between the coil greatly affect the value of the electricity that is able to be transferred. The test results showed that the receiver <b>coil</b> sectional <b>area</b> of 2. 5 mm 2 be able to receive a maximum power of 1. 36 watts and the farthest distance of 12 cm. So, the farther away the distance between the coils, the smaller energy capable to be transfer...|$|R
50|$|Because DSL {{operates}} {{above the}} 3.4 kHz voice limit, it cannot {{pass through a}} load coil, which is an inductive coil {{that is designed to}} counteract loss caused by shunt capacitance (capacitance between the two wires of the twisted pair). Load coils are commonly set at regular intervals in lines placed only for POTS. A DSL signal cannot pass through a properly installed and working load coil, while voice service cannot be maintained past a certain distance without such <b>coils.</b> Therefore, some <b>areas</b> that are within range for DSL service are disqualified from eligibility because of load coil placement. Because of this, phone companies endeavor to remove load coils on copper loops that can operate without them, and by conditioning other lines to avoid them through the use of fiber to the neighborhood or node (FTTN).|$|R
40|$|We discuss further {{developments}} {{in the application of}} Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to the design of pulsed magnets on the basis of our latest <b>coil</b> design. Two <b>areas</b> are addressed. Firstly, we present results concerning the current distribution in the conductor during the discharge. Eddy current heating leads to thermal gradients across the layers and in the conductor; the results are compared with well established analytical codes. Significantly higher stresses result due to temperature gradients and nonuniform current distribution, which can be partly offset by pre-stressing reinforcement fibers. Secondly, we report progress in designs that facilitate much more rapid cool-downs for pulsed magnets, which can sometimes take in the order of hours between pulses [...] We show that cool-down times of 20 minutes or less are achievable using copper discs (designed using FEA) that will not support eddy currents...|$|R
