6000|$|Sherlock Holmes {{preserved}} his calm professional manner {{until our}} visitor had left us, {{although it was}} easy for me, who knew him so well, to see that he was profoundly excited. The moment that Hilton Cubitt's broad back had disappeared through the door my comrade rushed to the table, laid out all the slips of paper containing dancing men in front of him, and threw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation. For two hours I watched him as he covered sheet after sheet of paper with figures and letters, so completely absorbed in his task that he had evidently forgotten my presence. Sometimes he was making progress and whistled and sang at his work; sometimes he was puzzled, and would sit for long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye. Finally he sprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction, and walked up and down the room rubbing his hands together. Then he wrote a long telegram upon a <b>cable</b> <b>form.</b> [...] "If my answer to this is as I hope, you will have a very pretty case to add to your collection, Watson," [...] said he. [...] "I expect that we shall be able to go down to Norfolk tomorrow, and to take our friend some very definite news as to the secret of his annoyance." ...|$|E

5000|$|B. Barbara has {{described}} {{it in this}} way: [...] "the turquoise cable moudling of an arch is seen below the dome, in which concentric rings of thirty-two lozenges diminish in size as they approach a centre which gives an impression of luminosity. The design, which suggests both movement and stillness, is a powerful though not an explicit vehicle of religious symbolism, speaking of the harmony of the universe. ... The support system of dome is illustrated by eight great arches of turquoise tilework in <b>cable</b> <b>form</b> which rise from a low dado to the full height of the wall, four {{in the position of}} squinches and four against the side walls; between them are kite-shaped squinches-pendentives. Within the dome, ranks of units of tilework of ogee-mandorla form are set in a lattice of plain brick and diminish in size until they meet a central sunbrust patterned with a tracery of arabesque".|$|E

5000|$|The vapour-sensing tube leak {{detection}} method involves {{the installation of}} a tube along {{the entire length of}} the pipeline. This tube - in <b>cable</b> <b>form</b> - is highly permeable to the substances to be detected in the particular application. If a leak occurs, the substances to be measured come into contact with the tube in the form of vapour, gas or dissolved in water. In the event of a leak, some of the leaking substance diffuses into the tube. After a certain period of time, the inside of the tube produces an accurate image of the substances surrounding the tube. In order to analyse the concentration distribution present in the sensor tube, a pump pushes the column of air in the tube past a detection unit at a constant speed. The detector unit at the end of the sensor tube is equipped with gas sensors. Every increase in gas concentration results in a pronounced [...] "leak peak".|$|E

25|$|At {{frequencies}} up {{to about}} 1GHz, pairs of wires are twisted together in a <b>cable,</b> <b>forming</b> a twisted pair. This reduces losses from electromagnetic radiation and inductive coupling. A twisted pair must be used with a balanced signalling system, so that the two wires carry equal but opposite currents. Each wire in a twisted pair radiates a signal, but it is effectively cancelled by radiation from the other wire, resulting in almost no radiation loss.|$|R

40|$|International audienceApoptosis is a {{mechanism}} of eliminating damaged or unnecessary cells during development and tissue homeostasis. During apoptosis within a tissue, the adhesions between dying and neighboring non-dying cells {{need to be}} remodeled so that the apoptotic cell is expelled. In parallel, contraction of actomyosin <b>cables</b> <b>formed</b> in apoptotic and neighboring cells drives cell extrusion. To date, the coordination between the dynamics of cell adhesion and the progressive changes in tissue tension around an apoptotic cell is not fully understood. Live imaging of histoblast expansion, which is a coordinated tissue replacement process during Drosophila metamorphosis, shows remodeling of adherens junctions (AJs) between apoptotic and non-dying cells, with {{a reduction in the}} levels of AJ components, including E-cadherin. Concurrently, surrounding tissue tension is transiently released. Contraction of a supra-cellular actomyosin <b>cable,</b> which <b>forms</b> in neighboring cells, brings neighboring cells together and further reshapes tissue tension toward the completion of extrusion. We propose a model in which modulation of tissue tension represents {{a mechanism}} of apoptotic cell extrusion...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{broadband}} resonant transducer {{capable of}} low-loss coupling between magnetoinductive waveguides {{and a real}} impedance is introduced. The transducer is an L-C circuit resonating at the resonant frequency of the elements forming the guide. However, {{the values of the}} components in the transducer are different, and chosen to obtain two separate nulls in reflection so that low reflection is obtained over a wide spectral range. The transducer can be incorporated into the MI waveguide itself, allowing a connection between a magneto-inductive cable and a conventional system to be made as a simple splice. The design is confirmed using two metre lengths of low-loss thin-film magnetoinductive <b>cables</b> <b>formed</b> using copper-clad polyimide and operating near 100 MHz frequency...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMbl is a {{bacterial}} actin homolog that controls cell morphogenesis in Bacillus subtilis. A functional GFP-Mbl fusion protein {{was used to}} examine the behavior of the helical <b>cables</b> <b>formed</b> by Mbl protein in live B. subtilis cells. The cables undergo dynamic changes during cell cycle progression. They are stable but not rigid while elongating in parallel with cell growth, and they require septum formation to divide/cleave. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis showed that the cables are continuously remodeled during cell elongation. Turnover occurs {{along the length of the}} helical Mbl filaments, with no obvious polarity and a recovery half-time of about 8 min.

5000|$|High power {{transmitting}} antennas for VLF frequencies {{are very}} large wire antennas, up to a mile across. They {{consist of a}} series of steel radio masts, linked at the top with a network of cables, often shaped like an umbrella or clotheslines. Either the towers themselves or vertical wires serve as monopole radiators, and the horizontal <b>cables</b> <b>form</b> a capacitive top-load to increase the efficiency of the antenna. High power stations use variations on the umbrella antenna such as the [...] "delta" [...] and [...] "trideco" [...] antennas, or multiply-tuned flattop (triatic) antennas. For low power transmitters, inverted-L and T antennas are used. A large loading coil is required at the antenna feed point to cancel the capacitive reactance of the antenna to make it resonant.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 In Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) or high {{frequency}} digital ICs, {{there is a}} demand to probe the internal nodes for testing. The ultra low capacitance RFIC probe presented in his work is a flexible tool for these applications. The probe utilizes the coupling between a tungsten needle and the inner conductor of a coaxial <b>cable,</b> <b>forming</b> a capacitor. The ultra low capacitance of the probe enables low probe loading on the circuit under test. With capacitive coupling, the probe output is the derivative of the input signal. Through the use of probe calibration and Fourier transforms, the probed signal can be recovered. Probe calibration develops a transfer function enabling recovery of time domain signals. By utilizing a simple mechanical design, input impedance is maximized and parasitic components are minimized...|$|R
