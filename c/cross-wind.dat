25|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{fitted with}} a retractable tricycle undercarriage with steerable nosewheels, allowing a fairly large crab angle during <b>cross-wind</b> landing. The reverse pitch control with which the aircraft is fitted allows the constant-speed mechanism to be manually overridden to reverse the blade pitch angle, thus providing excellent ground-handling characteristics, helping {{to slow down the}} plane to shorten the landing run. This control also allows the aircraft to back up on its own during taxiing.|$|E
25|$|In operation, the bombardier {{would first}} take a {{measurement}} of the wind speed using one {{of a variety of}} methods, and then dial that speed and direction into the bombsight.

25|$|The plane made {{radio contact}} with {{approach}} control at Prestwick shortly before 11:00p.m. At {{this point the}} <b>cross-wind</b> over the main runway had, unknown to Parmentier, dropped to 14knots which made it within limits to attempt a landing on the main runway. Instead, he decided to attempt an overshoot of the main runway guided by the ground radar controller, followed by a left-hand turn that would bring the plane downwind of the alternate runway. He would then overfly the runway before looping round for his final approach. While it might sound complicated, Parmentier {{expected to be in}} visual contact with the ground which would make such an attempt relatively easy.|$|E

25|$|The Bee, {{registered}} G-AEWC, first flew on 3 April 1937 at Heston Aerodrome, piloted by Hubert Broad. Engine cooling problems {{required a}} forced landing, {{and there were}} immediate comments on its sluggish handling {{in the air and}} on its <b>cross-wind</b> taxying problems due to the narrow track undercarriage. This was the Bee's only flight; before there was time to improve the cooling and handling, financial problems forced Carden-Baynes into Receivership in June 1937, and all development stopped. In November 1937, it was reported that production was on hold, until British engines became available. The Bee, its plans, and Carden-Baynes' design for a bigger aircraft were bought by the newly formed Scottish Aircraft Construction Co., but no more was heard of any of them apart from an uncertain report that the Bee was scrapped at Heston in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{locomotives}} (numbers 92020-92029) {{were built}} in 1955 with the Franco-Crosti boiler. which incorporated a combustion gas feed water preheater that recuperated low-grade residual heat In the 9F version, this {{took the form of}} a single cylindrical water drum running along the underside of the main boiler barrel. The standard chimney on top of the smokebox was only used during lighting up. In normal working the gases went through firetubes inside the preheater drum that led to a second smokebox situated beneath the boiler from which there emerged a chimney on the right-hand side, just forward of the firebox. In the event, the experiment did not deliver the hoped-for benefits, and efficiency was not increased sufficiently to justify the cost and complexity. Moreover, conditions were unpleasant on the footplate in a <b>cross-wind,</b> this in spite of the later provision of a small deflector plate forward of the chimney. These problems led to the subsequent removal of the preheater drum, although the locomotives did retain the original main smokebox with its distinctive look.|$|E

500|$|The {{solution}} was to fly lower: since radar operates in line-of-sight, detection of an aircraft flying at low altitudes is significantly hindered, thereby reducing time for enemy counter measures. In practice, trees, hills, valleys and any other obstructions reduce this range even more, making a ground-based interception extremely difficult. The Canberra was designed for medium- to high-altitude flight and was not suitable for continuous terrain-hugging flight; this would require a completely different aircraft. Low-level strike aircraft, or [...] "interdictors", grew into {{a new class of}} their own during the late 1950s. They generally featured high wing loading to reduce the effects of turbulence and <b>cross-wind,</b> some form of high-performance navigational radar to allow very low flight at high speeds, and large fuel loads to offset the higher fuel use at low altitudes.|$|E

Widerøe permitted aircraft to land in the maximum certified wind conditions, a <b>cross-wind</b> of 18meters per second (36knots) and 5meters per second (10knots) tail wind.

40|$|Abstract. Due {{to their}} very light {{structural}} weight, high-speed trains {{are very sensitive}} to the action of <b>cross-winds.</b> A common tool for the estimation of the safety of trains against <b>cross-winds</b> is provided by the Characteristic Wind Curves (CWC), that are evaluated in wind-tunnel tests and depend on the wind speed and direction at the railway line. The estimation of the wind speed and direction along railway lines is then fundamental to provide a reliable risk assessment. A new methodology has been developed for the evaluation of the wind speed along any railway line and to any context. Its current application deals with the Rome-Naples High Speed (HS) /High Capacity (HC) railway line in Italy. The present study is focused on the comparison between the probabilistic analyses carried out on data collected by anemome-ters placed along the line by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI) and those obtained through the application of the new methodology. The comparisons highlight both good agreements and noteworthy differences. A sound assessment of the uncertainties inherent in the new method-ology points out its merits and defects, providing clear indications about its effectiveness in evaluating the wind hazard along the railway line...|$|R

40|$|The {{selection}} of flight speed (airspeed) in migrating birds depends on multiple {{internal and external}} factors, such as wing morphology, weight and winds. Adjustment with respect to side winds to maintain an intended track direction may include a shift in heading direction and/or an increase in airspeed. Compensation for <b>cross-winds</b> cannot always be achieved if visual references are lacking or {{may not even be}} beneficial if adaptive wind drift is favourable. Flock size is an additional, although often neglected, factor that could influence the airspeed of birds. Here, we show that responses to <b>cross-winds</b> to achieve compensation differed on a small geographical scale (a few kilometres) in migrating shorebirds, where the availability of topographical features such as coastlines may play an important role for the birds' behaviour. We also show that airspeed was significantly influenced by flock size in three species of shorebirds, increasing with increasing flock size. This is contrary to the prediction based on the hypothesis of energy saving by flight in flock formation, but in agreement with empirical findings for migrating terns. The reason why flock size influences airspeed remains unclear, but we propose a mechanistic explanation based on the largest/heaviest individual(s) determining the speed of the flock...|$|R
