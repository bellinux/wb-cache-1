5000|$|A <b>jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> {{is a type}} {{of general}} purpose power {{transmission}} coupling that also can be used in motion control (servo) applications. It is designed to transmit torque (by connecting two shafts) while damping system vibrations and accommodating misalignment, which protects other components from damage. Jaw couplings are composed of three parts: two metallic hubs and an elastomer insert called an element, but commonly referred to as a [...] "spider". The three parts press fit together with a jaw from each hub fitted alternately with the lobes of the spider. <b>Jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> torque is transmitted through the elastomer lobes in compression.|$|R

The analysis was performed using the programme Deform- 3 D, based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). It is assumed that a forging of the <b>jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> sleeve-disk is made of Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy. A hollow preform is used as the billet. The hot orbital forging process is run using an industrial orbital forging press, MCOF 4000. The analysis focuses on the pattern of material flow, accuracy of the shape of the produced workpiece, as well as changes in the temperature of the material being formed...|$|R
5000|$|Jaw {{couplings}} {{are considered}} [...] "fail-safe" [...] because, should the elastomer fail or wear away, the <b>jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> hub teeth will mate, much like teeth on two gears, {{and continue to}} transmit torque.

The curved <b>jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> is less suited for applications that rely on a constant scanning type of motion, where accuracy is required during movement, which requires a torsionally stronger coupling.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We used a biomechanical {{model of}} the {{orofacial}} system, to investigate two issues in speech production: (1) the link between lip muscle anatomy and variability in lip gestures; (2) the constraints of coupled lip/jaw biomechanics on jaw posture in labial sounds. Method: Our methodology is based on computer simulations with a sophisticated biomechanical model <b>coupling</b> the <b>jaw,</b> tongue and face. First, the influence of Orbicularis Oris (OO) muscle geometry is analyzed. We assessed how changes to the OO anatomical implementation, in terms of depth (from epidermis to the skull) and peripheralness (proximity to the lip horn center), affected lip protrusion, lip spreading and lip area. Second, we evaluated the capability of the lip/jaw system to generate protrusion and rounding, or labial closure for different jaw heights. Results: (1) A highly peripheral and moderately deep OO implementation is most appropriate for achieving protrusion and rounding; (2) a superficial implementation facilitates closure; (3) protrusion and rounding requires a high jaw position; (4) labial closure is achievable for various jaw heights.

40|$|Investigation of {{ligament}} morphology and musculoskeletal mechanics in elasmobranchs {{that use}} suction (white-spotted bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium plagiosum and Ornate wobbegong, Orectolobus ornatus), bite (sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus) and generalist (suction and bite, spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias) feeding mechanisms reveal ligament morphologies and musculoskeletal mechanics specific to feeding mode, and novel ligament linkages in obligate suction feeders (C. plagiosum and O. ornatus) that <b>couple</b> <b>jaw</b> and hyoid depression. In vivo data of muscle strain, activation, skeletal kinematics and buccal pressure during suction capture and prey processing in C. plagiosum support {{the function of}} linkage systems in suction feeders during both behaviors. ^ The arrangements of the postspiracularis (LPI), hyomandibuloceratohyal (LHCC), hyoidiomandibular (LHMM) and hyomandibuloceratohyomandibular ligaments (LHCM) morphology at the chondrocraniohyomandibular (CHMA), hyomandibuloceratohyal (HMCA) and hyomandibulomandibular (HMMA) articulations are specific to feeding mode. The LPI and LHCC in Chiloscyllium plagiosum and Orectolobus ornatus and Squalus acanthias forms a moveable pulley and tether system that link hyomandibula (HMD) depression with ceratohyal (CER) in suction feeders and feeding generalists. The LHMM is split into two divisions in the four species the LHMM (medial division) and LHML (lateral division). The LHMM of C. plumbeus and S. acanthias forms a twisting linkage between the HMDs and CERs that results in anterolateral and ventral motion of the HMD in bite and generalist feeders. ^ Musculoskeletal morphology and mechanics underlining jaw and hyoid depression and jaw adduction in Chiloscyllium plagiosum, Carcharhinus plumbeus, and Squalus acanthias reveal a mosaic of convergent and divergent features. Coracomandibularis (CM, jaw depressor) physiological cross-sectional PSCA is the main contributor to variation in force output to the lower jaw during jaw depression in the three species. Morphology of the coracohyoideus (CH) and coracoarcualis (CA) (hyoid depressors) are similar in the three species. Mechanics of hyoid depression in C. plagiosum differ from C. plumbeus and S. acanthias in that the initial in-lever is {{much smaller than the}} other species due to alignment of the hyoid with the hyomandibuloceratohyal articulation. Application of four-bar linkage mechanics to the jaws and hyoid of C. plagiosum suggests that the jaw and hyoid depression are linked by the lateral hyoidiomandibular ligament (LHML-linkage) and result in levels of force transfer to the jaws and hyoid during suction feeding that are greater than that possible from un-linked systems. The jaw adductors and protruders in the three species, quadratomandibularis (QM), preorbitalis (PO) and levator palatoquadrati (LP, a jaw proturder in C. plumbeus only), are subdivided and complex in architecture. ^ Simultaneously measurement of hyoid and jaw kinematics, buccal pressure and fascicle shortening and muscle activity in the CM, CH and CA using Sonomicrometry in Chiloscyllium plagiosum reveal interaction of the feeding muscles and the LHML-linkage. Active shortening of the CM occurs prior to the onset of jaw opening and buccal pressure decrease, while jaw depression to peak gape occurs during CM lengthening. The CH actively lengthens and the CA actively shortens prior to jaw and hyoid depression. Peak active CM shortening, onset of active CH shortening, depression of the hyoid, and buccal pressure decrease occur simultaneously. A catch mechanism involving the LHML, LHMM and CM that would allow the CH to be lengthened by the CA and released, resulting in high-powered expansion during suction feeding is proposed. The CM initiates jaw lower depression while the CH and CA drive the jaw and hyoid to peak depression. The LHML in bamboo sharks appears to be a biomechanical link <b>coupling</b> lower <b>jaw</b> and hyoid depression that is convergent with the mandibulohyoid ligament in bony fishes. During bite processing, the CM shortens to depress the lower jaw and hyoid. Elevation of the hyoid prior to the onset of jaw depression results in increased positive orobranchial pressure and may help to secure prey in the mouth when the jaws are repositioned to deliver a processing bite. However, the LHML-linkage may constrain PO and QM function. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: The authors' general {{aim is to}} use biomechanical {{models of}} speech {{articulators}} to explore how possible variations in anatomical structure contribute to differences in articulatory strategies and phone systems across human populations. Specifically, they investigated 2 issues: (a) the link between lip muscle anatomy and variability in lip gestures and (b) the constraints of coupled lip/jaw biomechanics on jaw posture in labial sounds. METHOD: The authors used a model <b>coupling</b> the <b>jaw,</b> tongue, and face. First, {{the influence of the}} orbicularis oris (OO) anatomical implementation was analyzed by assessing how changes in depth (from epidermis to the skull) and peripheralness (proximity to the lip horn center) affected lip shaping. Second, the capability of the lip/jaw system to generate protrusion and rounding, or labial closure, was evaluated for different jaw heights. RESULTS: Results showed that a peripheral and moderately deep OO implementation is most appropriate for protrusion and rounding; a superficial implementation facilitates closure; protrusion and rounding require a high jaw position; and closure is achievable for various jaw heights.

40|$|International audienceMotor {{equivalence}} is a {{key feature}} of speech motor control, since speakers must constantly adapt to various phonetic contexts and speaking conditions. The Uncontrolled Manifold (UCM) idea offers a theoretical framework for considering motor equivalence. In this framework coordination among motor control variables is separated into two subspaces, one in which changes in control variables modify the acoustic output and another one in which these changes do not influence the output. Our work develops this concept for speech production using a 2 D biomechanical model of the tongue, <b>coupled</b> with a <b>jaw</b> and lip model, for vowel production. We first propose {{a representation of the}} linearized UCM based on orthogonal projection matrices. Next we characterize the UCMs of various vocal tract configurations of the 10 French oral vowels using their perturbation responses. We then investigate whether these UCMs describe phonetic classes like phonemes, front/back vowels, rounded/unrounded vowels, or whether they significantly vary across representatives of these different classes. We found they clearly differ between rounded and unrounded vowels, but are quite similar within each category. This suggests that similar motor equivalence strategies can be implemented within each of these classes and that UCMs provide a valid characterization of an equivalence strategy...|$|R
40|$|Trait decoupling, wherein {{evolutionary}} {{release of}} constraints permits specialization of formerly integrated structures, represents a major {{conceptual framework for}} interpreting patterns of organismal diversity. However, few empirical tests of this hypothesis exist. A central prediction, that the tempo of morphological evolution and ecological diversification should increase following decoupling events, remains inadequately tested. In damselfishes (Pomacentridae), a ceratomandibular ligament links the hyoid bar and lower <b>jaws,</b> <b>coupling</b> two main morphofunctional units directly involved in both feeding and sound production. Here, we test the decoupling hypothesis by examining the evolutionary consequences {{of the loss of}} the ceratomandibular ligament in multiple damselfish lineages. As predicted, we find that rates of morphological evolution of trophic structures increased following the loss of the ligament. However, this increase in evolutionary rate is not associated with an increase in trophic breadth, but rather with morphofunctional specialization for the capture of zooplanktonic prey. Lineages lacking the ceratomandibular ligament also shows different acoustic signals (i. e. higher variation of pulse periods) from others, resulting in an increase of the acoustic diversity across the family. Our results support the idea that trait decoupling can increase morphological and behavioral diversity through increased specialization rather than the generation of novel ecotypes.

40|$|Several models {{explain how}} a complex {{integrated}} system like the rodent mandible can arise from multiple developmental modules. The models propose various integrating mechanisms, including epigenetic effects of muscles on bones. We test five {{for their ability}} to predict correlations found in the individual (symmetric) and fluctuating asymmetric (FA) components of shape variation. We also use exploratory methods to discern patterns unanticipated by any model. Two models fit observed correlation matrices from both components: (1) parts originating in same mesenchymal condensation are integrated, (2) parts developmentally dependent on the same muscle form an integrated complex as do those dependent on teeth. Another fits the correlations observed in FA: each muscle insertion site is an integrated unit. However, no model fits well, and none predicts the complex structure found in the exploratory analyses, best described as a reticulated network. Furthermore, no model predicts the correlation between proximal parts of the condyloid and coronoid, which can exceed the correlations between proximal and distal parts of the same process. Additionally, no model predicts the correlation between molar alveolus and ramus and/or angular process, one of the highest correlations found in the FA component. That correlation contradicts the basic premise of all five developmental models, yet it should be anticipated from the epigenetic effects of mastication, possibly the primary morphogenetic process integrating the <b>jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> forces generated by muscle contraction with those experienced at teeth...|$|R
50|$|The {{powered axles}} of the ER2 {{trainset}} are individually driven: each axle {{is powered by}} its own traction motor, which {{is connected to the}} axle by a pair of spur gears with a torque ratio of 3.17 (73:23) in a fully enclosed gearbox. The large gear with a transmission modulus of 10 is mounted directly on the axle, whereas the small gear is on a shaft which is mounted on 2 ball bearings (on early trains) or roller bearings (on later trains). The gearbox casing is mounted on the axle by means of a sealed roller bearing, and is also attached to the truck frame via a special suspension. Initially this suspension comprised a sickle-shaped link with 2 rubber and metal shock absorbers, but beginning in 1969 this was replaced by a vertical rod with 4 such shock absorbers (as on the ER22). During motion of the train, the frame-suspended motors constantly move relative to the axles, which requires some kind of flexible drive to accommodate this motion. On early ER2s this was achieved by means of a <b>jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> between the motor shaft and the intermediate drive shaft, but on later trains, rubber rag joints were used instead. The first such joint was fitted to an ER2 in 1964 as an experiment; in late 1965, five more prototypes with rubber couplings were built, and from 1966 onward these became standard on all new ER2s.|$|R
40|$|Among odontocetes, {{members of}} the {{currently}} monotypic family Kogiidae are known as small-sized and largely enigmatic relatives of the great sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus. Most of the still scanty fossil record of Kogiidae is represented by isolated skulls and ear bones from Neogene deposits of the Northern Hemisphere, with the significant exception of Scaphokogia, a highly autapomorphic genus from the late Miocene deposits of the Pisco Formation, southern coast of Peru. Here we report on a new fossil kogiid specimen from Aguada de Lomas, a site where the upper Miocene beds of the Pisco Formation are exposed. This specimen (MUSM 888) consists of an almost complete Kogia-like cranium, which represents a new taxon of Kogiidae sharing many similarities with the recently described Nanokogia isthmia, from the late Miocene of Panama. MUSM 888 mainly differs from the latter taxon and from extant Kogia spp. by displaying a larger, anterolaterally elongated temporal fossa and well-defined dental alveoli on the upper <b>jaws.</b> <b>Coupled</b> with a relatively elongated rostrum, these characters suggest that MUSM 888 retained some degree of raptorial feeding abilities, contrasting with the strong suction feeding specialization seen in Kogia spp. Interestingly, MUSM 888 shared the southern coast of present day Peru with {{members of the}} subfamily Scaphokogiinae, whose unique convex rostrum and unusual neurocranial morphology seemingly indicate a peculiar foraging specialization that has still to be understood. In conclusion, the finding of MUSM 888 supports a long history of high diversity, morphological disparity, and sympatric habits in fossil kogiids, thus suggesting that our comprehension of the evolutionary path of pygmy sperm whales is still far from being exhaustive...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comThe connection between individual orofacial mechanoreceptive afferents and the motoneurones that innervate jaw muscles is not well established. For example, although electrical and mechanical stimulation of orofacial afferents in bulk evokes responses in the jaw closers, whether similar responses can be evoked in the jaw muscles from the discharge of type identified single orofacial mechanoreceptive afferents is not known. Using tungsten microelectrodes, we have recorded from 28 afferents in the inferior alveolar nerve and 21 afferents in the lingual nerve of human volunteers. We have used discharges of single orofacial afferents as the triggers and the electromyogram (EMG) of the masseter as the source to generate spike-triggered averaged records to illustrate time-based EMG modulation by the nerve discharge. We have then used cross correlation analysis to quantify the coupling. Furthermore, we have also used coherence analysis to study frequency-based relationship between the nerve spike trains and the EMG. The discharge patterns of the skin and mucosa receptors around the lip and the gingiva generated significant modulation in EMGs with a success rate of 40 % for both cross correlation and coherence analyses. The discharge patterns of the periodontal mechanoreceptors (PMRs) generated more coupling with a success rate of 70 % for cross correlation and about 35 % for coherence analyses. Finally, the discharges of the tongue receptors displayed significant <b>coupling</b> with the <b>jaw</b> muscle motoneurones with a success rate of about 40 % for both analyses. Significant modulation of the jaw muscles by single orofacial receptors suggests that they play important roles in controlling the jaw muscle activity so that mastication and speech functions are executed successfully.
