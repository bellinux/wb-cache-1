40|$|The authors {{characterize}} coordinated bidding {{strategies in}} two cases: a weak <b>cartel,</b> <b>in</b> which the bidders cannot make side-payments; {{and a strong}} <b>cartel,</b> <b>in</b> which the <b>cartel</b> members can exclude new entrants and can make transfer payments. The weak cartel can do no better than have its members submit identical bids. The strong <b>cartel</b> <b>in</b> effect reauctions the good among the cartel members.

5|$|Blancornelas {{covered the}} rise of Mexico's drug {{trafficking}} organizations for more than thirty years, but his best {{work in the field}} took place during the 1990s. During this period, Mexico experienced {{the rise of}} three powerful drug cartels: the Tijuana <b>Cartel</b> <b>in</b> the west; the Juárez <b>Cartel</b> <b>in</b> Ciudad Juárez; and the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> <b>in</b> the east. Blancornelas' stories are considered so crucial that almost every written account of the Tijuana Cartel cites him.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} dynamic cartel {{formation and}} antitrust enforcement when firms operate in demand-related markets. We show that cartel prosecution {{can have a}} knock-on effect: desisting a <b>cartel</b> <b>in</b> one market reduces profits and cartel stability and leads to the break-up of the <b>cartel</b> <b>in</b> the adjacent market. Cartel prosecution can also have a waterbed effect: desisting a cartel increases <b>cartel</b> stability <b>in</b> the adjacent market and induces <b>cartel</b> formation <b>in</b> previously com-petitive markets. We also consider policy implications of our analysis regarding an antitrust authority’s investment decision <b>in</b> <b>cartel</b> enforcement...|$|R
