5|$|The {{earliest}} geological {{period of}} the Paleozoic era, the <b>Cambrian,</b> {{takes its name from}} the <b>Cambrian</b> Mountains, where geologists first identified <b>Cambrian</b> remnants. In evolutionary studies the <b>Cambrian</b> is the period when most major groups of complex animals appeared (the <b>Cambrian</b> explosion). The older rocks underlying the <b>Cambrian</b> rocks in Wales lacked fossils which could be used to differentiate their various groups and were referred to as Pre-cambrian.|$|E
5|$|Archeocyatha {{are known}} only as fossils from the <b>Cambrian</b> period.|$|E
5|$|The first malacostracans {{appeared}} {{sometime in}} the <b>Cambrian,</b> when animals belonging to the Phyllocarida appeared.|$|E
5|$|There {{is general}} {{consensus}} that many factors helped trigger the <b>Cambrian</b> explosion, {{but there is}} no generally accepted consensus about the combination and the <b>Cambrian</b> explosion continues to be an area of controversy and research over why so rapid, why at the phylum level, why so many phyla then and none since, and even if the apparent fossil record is accurate.|$|E
5|$|There were {{periods of}} renewed prosperity. The <b>Cambrian</b> Mills in Newtown was {{purchased}} in 1866 by the <b>Cambrian</b> Flannel Company of Newtown and Llanidloes, which modernized the factory {{so it was}} the most advanced facility in Wales and diversified into making plain and coloured flannels, shawls, whittles, hose and tweeds.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Cambrian</b> Mills {{burned down}} in 1912 Newtown {{was no longer}} an {{important}} woollen industrial centre and many of the workers moved elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans have a {{rich and}} {{extensive}} fossil record, which begins with animals such as Canadaspis and Perspicaris from the Middle <b>Cambrian</b> age Burgess Shale. Most of the major groups of crustaceans appear in the fossil record {{before the end of}} the <b>Cambrian,</b> namely the Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (including barnacles and tongue worms) and Malacostraca; there is some debate as to whether or not <b>Cambrian</b> animals assigned to Ostracoda are truly ostracods, which would otherwise start in the Ordovician. The only classes to appear later are the Cephalocarida, which have no fossil record, and the Remipedia, which were first described from the fossil Tesnusocaris goldichi, but do not appear until the Carboniferous. Most of the early crustaceans are rare, but fossil crustaceans become abundant from the Carboniferous period onwards.|$|E
5|$|HMS <b>Cambrian</b> was a C-class light cruiser {{built for}} the Royal Navy during World War I. She was the name ship of her sub-class of four ships. Assigned to the Grand Fleet, the ship played only a small role during the war. <b>Cambrian</b> was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleets during the 1920s and was sent to support British interests in Turkey during the Chanak Crisis of 1922–23. The ship was placed in reserve in late 1929. She was sold for scrap in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Several {{possible}} {{specimens of}} W. fieldensis were also {{recovered from the}} Middle <b>Cambrian</b> Spence Shale member of the Langston Formation in Utah in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{emergence}} of these first multicellular organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years, in an event called the <b>Cambrian</b> explosion. Here, the majority of types of modern animals appeared in the fossil record, as well as unique lineages that subsequently became extinct. Various triggers for the <b>Cambrian</b> explosion have been proposed, including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cambrian</b> Mills in {{this village}} made blankets, shawls, {{stockings}} and other products for local sale and for export.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cambrian</b> Woollen Mill at Dre-fach Felindre was {{acquired}} by the state in 1976 for the Museum of the Welsh Woollen Industry, now named the National Wool Museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossils of}} the Burgess Shale were hidden in store rooms until the 1960s. When Whittington {{and his colleagues}} first began to publish their Burgess finds in the early 1970s, the fossils became central to the debate about how quickly animals arose, and were {{interpreted}} as evidence that all the living bilaterian phyla {{had appeared in the}} Early <b>Cambrian,</b> along with many other phyla that had become extinct {{by the end of the}} <b>Cambrian.</b>|$|E
5|$|The overall {{community}} and ecology {{is very similar}} to that of other <b>Cambrian</b> localities, suggesting a global pool of species that repopulated localities after calamitous burial events occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{paucity of}} Ediacaran fossils after the <b>Cambrian</b> could simply {{be due to}} {{conditions}} that no longer favoured the fossilisation of Ediacaran organisms, which may have continued to thrive unpreserved.|$|E
5|$|Although corals first {{appeared}} in the <b>Cambrian</b> period, some , fossils are extremely rare until the Ordovician period, 100 million years later, when rugose and tabulate corals became widespread. Paleozoic corals often contained numerous endobiotic symbionts.|$|E
5|$|Barmouth Bridge (Welsh: Pont Abermaw), {{also known}} as Barmouth Viaduct, is a {{single-track}} largely wooden railway viaduct that carries the <b>Cambrian</b> Coast Railway across the River Mawddach estuary {{on the coast of}} Cardigan Bay, Wales. It sits between Morfa Mawddach and Barmouth in Gwynedd and caters for rail, foot and cycle traffic.|$|E
5|$|Crawford also {{returned}} to field work, carrying out archaeological excavation for the <b>Cambrian</b> Archaeological Association in both Wiltshire and Wales. In mid-1920, he excavated at Roundwood, Hampshire {{and on the}} Isle of Wight for Sir William Portal.|$|E
5|$|Most Actiniaria do {{not form}} hard parts {{that can be}} {{recognized}} as fossils, but a few fossils of sea anemones do exist; Mackenzia, from the Middle <b>Cambrian</b> Burgess Shale of Canada, is the oldest fossil identified as a sea anemone.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{paleontology}} {{that has}} {{seen a lot of}} activity during the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond is the study of the <b>Cambrian</b> explosion during which many of the various phyla of animals with their distinctive body plans first appear. The well-known Burgess Shale <b>Cambrian</b> fossil site was found in 1909 by Charles Doolittle Walcott, and another important site in Chengjiang China was found in 1912. However, new analysis in the 1980s by Harry B. Whittington, Derek Briggs, Simon Conway Morris and others sparked a renewed interest and a burst of activity including discovery of an important new fossil site, Sirius Passet, in Greenland, and the publication of a popular and controversial book, Wonderful Life by Stephen Jay Gould in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Petersham Gate {{served the}} Russell School, {{replacing}} the more ornate gates to Petersham Lodge. A disused carriage gate further {{up the hill}} was probably a tradesman's entrance to the school or to the Lodge stables. Bishop's Gate in Chisholm Road, previously known as the Cattle Gate, was for use by livestock allowed to pasture in the nineteenth century. It was opened for public use in 1896. Kitchen Garden Gate, hidden behind Teck Plantation, is probably a nineteenth-century gate. It has never been open to the public. <b>Cambrian</b> Gate or <b>Cambrian</b> Road Gate was constructed during World War I {{for access to the}} newly built South Africa Military Hospital. When the hospital was demolished in 1925, the entrance was made permanent and public as a pedestrian gate.|$|E
5|$|Since the <b>Cambrian</b> {{explosion}} {{there have}} been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions. The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals. Over the past 66million years, mammalian life diversified.|$|E
5|$|Some {{analyses}} of helcionellids concluded {{these were the}} earliest gastropods. However, other scientists are not convinced these Early <b>Cambrian</b> fossils show clear signs of the torsion that identifies modern gastropods twists the internal organs so the anus lies above the head.|$|E
5|$|Some other notable {{structures}} were added when smaller companies were amalgamated into the GWR. These include the South Devon Railway sea wall, the Cornwall Railway's Royal Albert Bridge, and Barmouth Bridge on the <b>Cambrian</b> Railways.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cambrian</b> {{explosion}} {{took place}} around 540 to 520 {{million years ago}} (Mya). In this geologically brief period, all the major animal phyla diverged and these included the first creatures with mineralized skeletons. Brachiopods and bivalves made their appearance at this time, and left their fossilized remains behind in the rocks.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cambrian</b> {{radiation}} saw {{an explosion}} in the variety of animal body plans, from flatworms and molluscs to arthropods and vertebrates. Carroll explains how shifting the pattern of Hox gene expression shaped the bodies of different types of arthropods and different types of vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The Middle <b>Cambrian</b> fossil Amiskwia {{from the}} Burgess Shale has been classed as a nemertean, {{based on a}} {{resemblance}} to some unusual deep-sea swimming nemerteans, but few paleontologists accept this classification as the Burgess Shale fossils show no evidence of rhynchocoel nor intestinal caeca.|$|E
5|$|The {{assemblage}} {{is easily}} dated {{because it contains}} many fine ash-beds, which are {{a good source of}} zircons used in the uranium-lead method of radiometric dating. These fine-grained ash beds also preserve exquisite detail. Constituents of this biota appear to survive through until the extinction of all Ediacarans {{at the base of the}} <b>Cambrian.</b>|$|E
5|$|The note {{appears to}} have {{originally}} been signed, but the name was torn off or burned off so that her body could not be identified. When the announcement was printed in the local newspaper, The <b>Cambrian,</b> therefore, it did not refer to Imlay specifically.|$|E
5|$|The slate {{deposits}} of Wales belong to three geological series: <b>Cambrian,</b> Ordovician and Silurian. The <b>Cambrian</b> deposits run south-west from Conwy to near Criccieth; these deposits were quarried in the Penrhyn and Dinorwig quarries {{and in the}} Nantlle Valley. There are smaller outcrops elsewhere, for example on Anglesey. The Ordovician deposits run south-west from Betws-y-Coed to Porthmadog; these were the deposits mined at Blaenau Ffestiniog. There is another band of Ordovician slate further south, running from Llangynnog to Aberdyfi, quarried mainly in the Corris area, with a few outcrops in south-west Wales, notably Pembrokeshire. The Silurian deposits are mainly further east in the Dee valley and around Machynlleth.|$|E
5|$|There is however little {{evidence}} for any trace fossils in the Ediacaran Period, which may speak against the active grazing theory. Further, {{the onset of}} the <b>Cambrian</b> Period is defined by the appearance of a worldwide trace fossil assemblage, quite distinct from the activity-barren Ediacaran Period.|$|E
5|$|A few mineralized fossils that {{resemble}} corals {{have been found}} in rocks from the <b>Cambrian</b> period, and corals diversified in the Early Ordovician. These corals, which were wiped out in the Permian-Triassic extinction about , did not dominate reef construction since sponges and algae also played a major part. During the Mesozoic era rudist bivalves were the main reef-builders, but they were wiped out in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , and since then the main reef-builders have been scleractinian corals.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderate}} leader, {{he worked}} fruitlessly alongside William Abraham {{to resolve the}} 1910–11 <b>Cambrian</b> Combine dispute, after {{the two men were}} shunned by the more radical miners' leaders. Although espousing Gladstonian Liberalism and opposing the affiliation of The Miners' Federation of Great Britain to the Labour Party, Watts Morgan joined the more radical and Marxist Plebs' League and sat on the board of governors for the Central Labour College.|$|E
5|$|A true {{ocean basin}} {{developed}} to the west, breaking all the earlier formations along a steep front. A wedge of clastic sediment {{then began to}} accumulate {{at the base of}} the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves. Three formations developed from sediment that accumulated on the wedge. The region's first known fossils of complex life are found in the resulting formations. Notable among these are the Ediacara fauna and trilobites, the evolution of the latter being part of the <b>Cambrian</b> Explosion of life.|$|E
5|$|During the Paleozoic era, {{the western}} part of what would become North America was near the equator and on a passive margin. The <b>Cambrian</b> Explosion of life took place over about 15million years {{in this part of the}} world. Climate was warm and invertebrates, such as the trilobites, were abundant. An ocean started to return to the Grand Canyon area from the west about 550million years ago. As its {{shoreline}} moved east, the ocean began to concurrently deposit the three formations of the Tonto Group.|$|E
5|$|Further {{sedimentary}} deposits {{were formed}} through the <b>Cambrian</b> period (541–485 Ma), some of which, {{along with the}} earlier Precambrian sediments, metamorphosed into the Dalradian series. This is composed {{of a wide variety}} of materials, including mica schist, biotite gneiss schist, schistose grit, greywacke and quartzite. The area that would become Scotland was at this time close to the south pole and part of Laurentia. Fossils from the north-west Highlands indicate the presence of trilobites and other primitive forms of life.|$|E
