First, <b>challenge</b> <b>procedures</b> acutely stimulate neurotransmitter and (or) hormonal {{systems in the}} brain and offer the chance to assess the function, and (or) reserve, of the brain neurotransmitter/hormone system of relevance. Second, these paradigms often offer functional informa-tion about specific areas of the brain (e. g., limbic-hypo-thalamus). Regardless of these advantages, the power of these procedures is limited to the specificity of the agent and of the functional anatomy of the “circuit”that leads to the outcome measure, which, in turn, is linked to the stimulation by the acute pharmacologic challenge.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1998 Ian Scott HendersonThe Commonwealth government is considering acceding to the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Government Procurement (AGP). The purpose of the AGP is to liberalise government procurement amongst member countries. Pursuant to Art. XX of the AGP, it is a requirement for a member country to have a procedure whereby suppliers can challenge government procurement decisions. A review of the existing mechanisms under Australian law for challenging procurement can be challenged. I believe {{that none of the}} existing measures are sufficient to meet the requirements of Art. XX. Accordingly, I suggest adopting a new <b>challenge</b> <b>procedure,</b> with any challenge to be heard by a new administrative body. This <b>challenge</b> <b>procedure</b> can cover either only AGP related procurement, or all Commonwealth government procurement. Further, whereas the <b>challenge</b> <b>procedure</b> can be limited to only the requirements of Art. XX, I recommend including other procedural points to make for a better procedure. Accordingly, recommendations are made for both a <b>challenge</b> <b>procedure</b> that meets the minimum requirement of the AGP and a preferred procedure. Open Acces...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the relationship between these markers. Thirty-nine remitted depressed patients participated in 2 ATD sessions in a double-blind crossover design. CR, assessed prior to the ATD sessions, predicted depressive response to high-dose ATD. CR also diminished the effects of 2 known predictors of ATD response: gender and residual symptoms. Neuroticism and behavioral inhibition were unrelated to ATD response. CR is associated with an increased sensitivity to reductions of serotonin concentrations.

40|$|As {{one of the}} {{original}} contracting parties to the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) since the Tokyo Round, Hong Kong also participated actively in the negotiations to improve the GPA during the Uruguay Round and joined the new GPA shortly after it entered into force in 1996. In order to ensure effective enforcement of the obligations, the new GPA explicitly requires Members to establish a <b>challenge</b> <b>procedure</b> and this has been praised as “arguably the most innovative aspect” of the GPA. 1 As explained by Arrowsmith: “[i]n providing for a detailed system of supplier remedies the GPA marks a departure from the approach of most other WTO agreements. In general, these do not require affected private parties to be given a right to enforce WTO rules, but rely mainly on inter-governmental enforcement. Private challenge procedures are required under some of these provisions, but *P. P. L. R. 212 none go as far as the GPA. In particular, their procedural requirements and obligations on remedies are not as detailed or stringent as those of the GPA and they generally give greater deference to states' own national traditions of review in the particular area concerned. ” 2 While there has been an extensive literature on the <b>challenge</b> <b>procedure</b> of the GPA in general, 3 as well as excellent country studies on the operation of the national challenge procedures of several key GPA Members, 4 no such study has been conducted for Hong Kong yet.

40|$|Background: Topiramate was {{recently}} {{reported to be}} efficacious in reducing drinking rates and craving among individuals with alcohol dependence in a randomized controlled trial, but dose effects could not be determined. This laboratory study systematically examined the dose-depen-dent effects of topiramate on cue-elicited craving and other putative mechanisms of its pharmaco-therapeutic effects on drinking. Methods: Male and female heavy drinkers (n = 61) were randomized to 1 of 3 medication conditions (200 mg ⁄ d; 300 mg ⁄ d; placebo) in a double-blind study.
