5|$|A {{significant}} portion of media <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> directed at the Pistons fans and 46% of the voters in the ESPN SportsNation poll believed that the fans were {{to blame for the}} incident. Other commentators said that Artest and the other players involved were to blame.|$|E
5|$|<b>Criticism</b> <b>was</b> also {{directed}} towards Microsoft's decision to no longer provide specific {{details on the}} contents of cumulative updates for Windows 10. On February 9, 2016, Microsoft retracted this decision and began to provide release notes for cumulative updates on the Windows website.|$|E
5|$|When Grand Theft Auto III was {{released}} to mobile devices in December 2011, it received generally positive reviews. Metacritic calculated an average score of 80 out of 100, based on 26 reviews. Reviewers liked the enhanced visuals, but <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> {{directed at the}} touchscreen controls.|$|E
60|$|GILBERT. But, surely, <b>Criticism</b> <b>is</b> {{itself an}} art. And just as artistic {{creation}} implies the working {{of the critical}} faculty, and, indeed, without it cannot be said to exist at all, so <b>Criticism</b> <b>is</b> really creative in the highest sense of the word. <b>Criticism</b> <b>is,</b> in fact, both creative and independent.|$|R

5000|$|Foolish <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> unclear {{about what}} the motive or purpose of the <b>criticism</b> <b>is,</b> or {{about what the}} {{consequence}} or effect of the <b>criticism</b> <b>is.</b> Usually it connotes lack of self-insight or {{a good understanding of}} the motives or issue involved. The foolish critic often mistakes what his target should be, and therefore, his <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> really [...] "at the wrong address", it is in some sense misplaced, disingenuous or misjudged ("clutching at straws", [...] "tilting at windmills", [...] "Red herring").|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} were affected by inability to reach their premises even where the premises themselves were largely unaffected by the blast. <b>Criticism</b> <b>was</b> expressed by local citizens and the local MP that originally the depot had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises being built near the depot.|$|E
5|$|After {{the results}} of the first scrutiny, Cardinal Avila, Philip III of Spain's {{representative}} at the conclave, announced that Philip had vetoed Baronius. Baronius had critiqued the claims of Spanish monarchs in ecclesistical affairs in the volume of his Annales Ecclesiastici that had been published in 1605. This led the Spanish monarchy to have such an intense dislike for him that the publication of the volume which contained his <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> banned in Spanish territory.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist pre-release {{reception}} {{was generally}} positive, despite criticism {{of its new}} voice actor. The game received generally positive reviews when it was released, with praise for its level design, story, gameplay, combat, soundtrack and multiplayer mode. However, <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> directed at its dated graphics, lack of challenge and ending. It failed to meet Ubisoft's sales expectations, with sales of two million copies three months after its release.|$|E
40|$|General <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> {{associated}} with poorer relationship functioning; however, few studies of specifically non-hostile and hostile criticism in relationships have yet been conducted. The present {{study examined the}} associations of hostile and non-hostile criticism with perceived support, perceived conflict, and support seeking intentions in platonic (non-romantic, non-familial) relationships. Perceptions of hostile <b>criticism</b> <b>were</b> related to greater conflict, lower support, and lower support seeking. Perceptions of non-hostile <b>criticism</b> <b>were</b> {{associated with}} greater support and support seeking; however, perceptions of non-hostile <b>criticism</b> <b>were</b> more strongly linked with greater support seeking in men than in women...|$|R
50|$|Constructive {{criticism}} aims to {{show that}} an intent or purpose of something is better served by an alternative approach. In this case, making the <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily deemed wrong, and its purpose is respected; rather, it is claimed that the same goal could be better achieved via a different route. Constructive <b>criticisms</b> <b>are</b> often suggestions for improvement - how things could be done better or more acceptably. They draw attention to how an identified problem could be solved, or {{how it could be}} solved better. Constructive <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> more likely accepted if the <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> timely, clear, specific, detailed and actionable.|$|R

5|$|Croc: Legend of the Gobbos {{received}} average {{reviews from}} critics; praise was directed towards the game's visuals and its music, while <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> directed towards the game's controls and camera. The game was a commercial success, with the PlayStation version {{going on to}} sell over 3 million copies. A sequel to the game, titled Croc 2, was released in 1999.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, I Ching {{interpretation}} {{divided into}} two schools, originating {{in a dispute over}} minor differences between different editions of the received text. The first school, known as New Text <b>criticism,</b> <b>was</b> more egalitarian and eclectic, and sought to find symbolic and numerological parallels between the natural world and the hexagrams. Their commentaries provided the basis of the School of Images and Numbers. The other school, Old Text <b>criticism,</b> <b>was</b> more scholarly and hierarchical, and focused on the moral content of the text, providing the basis for the School of Meanings and Principles. The New Text scholars distributed alternate versions of the text and freely integrated non-canonical commentaries into their work, as well as propagating alternate systems of divination such as the Taixuanjing. Most of this early commentary, such as the image and number work of Jing Fang, Yu Fan and Xun Shuang, is no longer extant. Only short fragments survive, from a Tang dynasty text called Zhou yi jijie.|$|E
5|$|Faryl {{was fairly}} well {{received}} by critics, who praised Smith's performances and Cohen's production. However, <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> {{directed at the}} use of the orchestra and at the song choices. As one of the ten best-selling classical albums in the UK in 2009, Faryl was nominated for a Classical BRIT Award in the album of the year category, but lost to Only Men Aloud's Band of Brothers. In 2013, the album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry.|$|E
50|$|Speculative <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> often criticized {{precisely}} because it is speculative, i.e., because relevant evidence is unavailable, or because the <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> made before “the evidence is in.” In this case, the <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> considered to lack any solid basis. For example, politicians (or political commentators) might dismiss “speculative newspaper stories” {{because they believe that}} these stories are just “spin” based on gossip and hearsay, and not based on any “hard evidence”.|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "radical" [...] {{derives from}} the Latin word [...] "radix" [...] ("root"). Thus, radical {{criticism}} means criticism {{that goes to the}} root of things, to the roots of the problem. Revolutionary <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> <b>criticism</b> that aims to overturn or overthrow an existing idea or state of affairs.Thus, an existing idea may be turned upside down. Revolutionary <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> sometimes also used in the sense of <b>criticism</b> that <b>is</b> unprecedented, or previously unheard of. Typically these kinds of <b>criticism</b> <b>are</b> associated with the youth, who are the new generation finding their identity in a battle with the older generations.|$|R
50|$|Not infrequently, some {{of these}} {{different}} senses of professional <b>criticism</b> <b>are</b> mixed together, especially when people try to pretend somebody's <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> authoritative (they {{seem to have a}} professional expertise, although they really lack this expertise), or when people try to pretend that somebody's <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> not authoritative (they are treated as no better than the rest, although in reality they are highly professional, and more competent and experienced than the rest).|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, King Leopold II started to receive {{criticism}} for his treatment of the natives in Congo Free State. In the United States, the main outlet of this <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> the Presbyterian church. In 1891, Sheppard became involved with William Morrison after Lapsley's death. They would report the crimes they saw, and later, {{with the help of}} Roger Casement, would form the Congo Reform Association (CRA), one of the world's first humanitarian organizations.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo Power {{reviewed}} Snake Rattle 'n' Roll {{as part of}} {{an overview}} of NES games which the magazine felt were overlooked or otherwise did not sell well. Their main <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> that the main characters were not recognizable to anyone, giving the game a lack of visibility amongst consumers. Otherwise, they praised the game for its precise controls and for its blend of puzzle and action elements.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} {{the book for}} public educators as {{an important contribution to}} liberal theory. Their common <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> based around practical applications and the imposition of autonomy as a value, e.g., her contemporary examples of national civics education, how citizens who disagreed with the focus on autonomy could be accommodated, and how a weak perfectionist state could defend marginalized group interests in a public school setting.|$|E
50|$|The {{main effect}} of lousy <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> usually that, rather than {{clarifying}} things, it becomes disorienting or confusing to people. Therefore, lousy <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> usually regarded as unhelpful, or as an unwanted distraction {{getting in the way}} of things. The only thing a lousy <b>criticism</b> achieves <b>is</b> to make it clear that somebody has an objection (although the objection is not well-taken).|$|R

5|$|The Windows {{version of}} the game {{received}} mixed reviews, with IGN rating it a 7.5/10, and GameSpot giving it a 7.0/10. Most <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> due to the late release date, and the graphics being dated. It received an aggregate score of 72.67% from GameRankings and 72 out of 100 from Metacritic.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} elements of combat and arcade sequences, including traditional elephant racing and big-game hunting. The {{core of the}} gameplay is focused on strategy, in which the player must conquer all territories of India through diplomatic or offensive means. Champion of the Raj received mixed reviews upon release. Critics praised its colourful graphics and storyline; however strong <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> directed at the game's constant use of disk swapping and long loading times.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, with praise going towards the game's single player mode {{and the changes}} made from the original game, though <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> directed towards the game's multiplayer mode and lack of analog controls.

5|$|The {{game was}} a major {{commercial}} failure, and Looking Glass ceased its self-publishing operations after its release. Despite this, it was generally well reviewed by critics, who praised Jim McKay's commentary and the game's graphics and atmosphere. <b>Criticism</b> <b>was</b> leveled against its lack of multiplayer or course creation functionality, and some reviewers found fault with its brevity.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Ocean Software, {{in which they were}} renowned for creating video games related to their respective films. Navy SEALS focuses on Hawkins recovering caches of Stinger missiles from Arab soldiers in the Middle East. The game received positive reviews upon release, with critics mainly praising the graphics, presentation and challenging gameplay. However, <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> directed at the ZX Spectrum port, which received disapproval over its monochrome graphics.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} directly after Nightshade, and re-uses the latter game's Filmation II game engine that allows images to be rendered without overlapping each other. The game received mostly positive reviews upon release; praise {{was directed at}} the graphics and presentation, but <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> directed at the game's similarity to Nightshade. It was later included in Rare Replay, Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation.|$|E
