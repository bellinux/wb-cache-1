It laid down detailed health and safety requirements and specified how these were to be met. It also contained provisions on training in the area, medical surveillance, and health and safety services. Two Orders of July 1982 amended the rules applicable to fixed-term contracts and temporary work with the intention of restricting the use of casual labour and improving the living and working conditions of workers in insecure jobs. A law of July 1982 concerning the spouses of craftsmen and tradesmen employed in the family business amended the provisions of the labour code, social security system, civil code and company law to establish an occupational status for this group of people.

With the assumption that stationary <b>current</b> <b>account</b> series ensures the long-run budget constraint while countries may experience "local non-stationarity" in <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balances, we examine the dynamics of <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balances across a panel of 70 countries. We find that once we allow <b>current</b> <b>account</b> series to take regime shifts by applying a Markovswitching (MS) process, we are able not only to reject the unit root null hypothesis for a much increased number of countries than with standard linear unit root tests, but also to identify notable cross-country differences in the timing and duration of stationary and locally nonstationary regimes. Armed with the structural break dates the MS-ADF testing provides, we investigate the determinants of the different degrees of <b>current</b> <b>account</b> persistence. We find that emerging market countries with fixed exchange rate regime or countries with greater financial openness {{are more likely to}} enter a random walk regime, which is more evident among countries with <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits. For countries with all levels of income, trade openness decreases the likelihood of entering the random walk regime, presumably reducing the cost of <b>current</b> <b>account</b> adjustments. Also, countries with budget deficits tend to stay in stationary regimes, so do those with <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits, implying that markets force these countries to rebalance their <b>current</b> <b>account</b> imbalances.

The primary {{objective of the}} study was to determine whether Zimbabweâ€™s <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit is sustainable or not. The study involved investigating whether the <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits violates the intertemporal budget constraints (IBC) or not, investigating the causal relationship between capital flows and <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits, and whether there is evidence of speculative capital inflows into the economy which are subject to sudden stops and reversal. When a country runs persistent <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits, questions are raised on the ability of a country to generate future <b>current</b> <b>account</b> surpluses to meet its external debt obligations created by past <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits. The study applied the intertemporal balance model developed by Liu and Tanner, (1996) to assess sustainability of the <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit. The analysis involved testing the stationarity of <b>current</b> <b>account</b> to GDP ratio. Unit root tests were initially conducted by applying the ADF test. However, given its inability to discriminate clearly between non-stationary and stationary series with a higher degree of autocorrelation and sensitivity to breaks, the study also used second generation stationarity tests, notably the Dickey-Fuller Generalized Least Square (DF GLS), the semi-parametric Phillips-Perron test and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test. In addition, cointegration a test was conducted which also give way to the Error Correction Model (ECM).
