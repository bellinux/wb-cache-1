40|$|An {{interlayer}} of {{face centered cubic}} (fcc) Co 4 N {{has demonstrated}} significant improvements in adhesion between <b>copper</b> and <b>diffusion</b> barrier layers. This fcc phase of Co 4 N was prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using bis(N-tert-butyl-N′-ethyl-propionamidinato) cobalt(II) and a reactant mixture of NH 3 and H 2 at substrate temperatures from 100 to 180 ◦C. The Co/N atomic ratio and the phase of cobalt nitride film can be modified by adjusting the ratio of NH 3 and H 2 in the gas feedstock. The cobalt nitride films prepared by CVD are smooth, highly conformal, and stable against intermixing with copper up to at least 400 ◦C. This fcc cobalt nitride material has very strong adhesion to copper due to the small lattice mismatch (− 1 to 2 %) between fcc-Co 4 N and fcc Cu. Copper wires should be stabilized against failure by electromigration when fcc cobalt nitride interlayers are placed between the <b>copper</b> and surrounding <b>diffusion</b> barriers. © 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|One {{main reason}} {{for the use of}} Fe-Cu-C system in PM {{industry}} is the presence of liquid phase (copper) at the start of sintering (1120 oC). The diffusion of liquid copper into iron causes swelling in the structure. This in turn can cause high dimensional change and, if not controlled properly, may cause distortion. So it is of paramount importance to control the <b>copper</b> <b>diffusion.</b> Carbon, added as graphite, reduces the swelling of copper by changing the dihedral angle. The affect of graphite on <b>copper</b> <b>diffusion</b> depends on the graphite type, particle size of graphite and heating rate. The aim of this work was to find the influence of graphite type and particle size of graphite on <b>copper</b> <b>diffusion.</b> Water Atomized iron (ASC 100. 29) produced in Höganäs AB was taken as the base powder.   Two types of graphite were used each with two different particle sizes. Two different graphite quantities (0. 2 % & 0. 8 %) for each type was taken. Natural fine graphite (UF 4), Natural coarse graphite (PG 44), Synthetic fine graphite (F 10) and  Synthetic coarse graphite (KS 44) were the graphites used in this work. Powders were compacted at 600 Mpa and the sintering was done at 1120 oC for 30 minutes in 90 / 10 N 2 /H 2. Dilatometry and metallographic investigation of the samples sintered in the production furnace were used to understand the graphite influence.   The investigation showed that at low graphite levels (0. 2 %), the affect of graphite type or graphite size was not significant on <b>copper</b> <b>diffusion.</b> At high graphite levels (0. 8 %),  synthetic graphites were more effective in reducing the swelling of copper. Influence of  particle size of synthetic graphites on Cu diffusion was not significant compared to the influence of particle size of natural graphite.

The Ti adhesion layer plays a significant role on the gm and Vp uniformity of the Cu-metallized PHEMTs.
