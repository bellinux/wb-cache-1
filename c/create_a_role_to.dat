40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{leveraging}} client business value in a software development outsourcing relationship. We have observed software development projects from two different Dutch IT outsourcing companies and studied the approach they apply in their (successful) projects. The results show that they <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> dedicated <b>to</b> facilitate communication. This arrangement has the po-tential to put team members {{in a better position to}} communi-cate, facilitating the transfer of information supporting the rationale behind design decisions. Teams are thus better equipped to anticipate change and to react faster in solving everyday problems. This paper describes our observations and the practical implications we expect, such as the im-provement of re-buy intention on the client’s side...|$|R
50|$|Tiring of {{the nineteenth-century}} theatre's routine {{scenarios}} and the dominant naturalistic trends of the time, however, Komissarzhevskaya boldly extended {{an invitation to}} the young director Vsevolod Meyerhold. Though they found some success with Komissarzhevskaya starring in the title roles of Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and Maeterlink's Sister Beatrice, the collaboration proved unfruitful. Meyerhold failed <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> that catered <b>to</b> Komissarzhevskaya's acting style, a mixture of intense emotional sensitivity with high theatrical seriousness. She dismissed him after just one year, and spent the remainder of her career touring old productions in the United States and Europe.|$|R

[...] The Octoroon Girl {{is an example of}} this effort to put African-American women in a good light - or, perhaps, simply to make known the realities of middle class African-American life. Motley’s presentation of the woman not only fulfilled his desire to celebrate accomplished blacks but also <b>created</b> <b>an</b> aesthetic <b>role</b> model <b>to</b> which those who desired an elite status might look up to.

5000|$|There is {{the need}} to align IT Development with the {{business}}-system as a whole. A long-standing problem in business is how to get the best return from IT investments, which are generally very expensive and of critical, often strategic, importance. IT departments, aware of the problem, often <b>create</b> <b>a</b> business analyst <b>role</b> <b>to</b> better understand, and define the requirements for their IT systems. Although there may be some overlap with the developer and testing roles, the focus is always on the IT part of the change process, and generally, this type of business analyst gets involved, only when a case for change has already been made and decided upon.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Global talent {{management}} {{has been widely}} discussed in academia {{during the last decade}} and is described as one of the keys for future success. Nevertheless the methods and procedures for the best practices are still not fully understood. This study focuses on the use of global talent pools for which multinational corporations (MNC) establish groups of individuals foreseen to take on important roles in the top tier management of the organization. Earlier researches are lacking to explain how these pools are established and for what purpose. By investigating a number of global MNCs this study shows that the creation of global talent pools not only focuses on human capital retention but also is a tool used to emphasize control of subsidiaries <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> somewhat similar <b>to</b> expats. Furthermore by gathering talents into pools, social bonds between the members are formed which are seen as very valuable for forming an inter-organizational network. Another important aspect from the research findings is the homogeneity of people in these groups where mid-age Caucasian men dominate, highlighting the failure in fulfilling company diversity goals.

40|$|Sustainable Development" {{refers to}} a set of issues {{relating}} to two general questions: (1) Are the presently prevailing technologies and lifestyles of economic development so destructive of the earth's natural resources and environment that the current pace of development cannot be maintained? (2) If so, what combinations of technology, life-style, and rate of growth are sustainable in the 'long-run,' and what mechanisms of cooperation and incentives can be devised to implement them? After providing some introductory background material for newcomers to the subject, and concluding that the answer to the first question is "yes. " I sketch some challenges to economic theory implied by the second question. In particular, I argue that, for transnational issues like global warming, the 'standard' approaches of mechanism design theory are inadequate {{in the absence of a}} world government or equivalent institution for enforcing cooperative agreements. On the other hand, the typical large multiplicity of noncooperative equilibria of such global dynamic "games" <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> for analysts <b>to</b> discover (invent?) equilibria that are superior to the status-quo equilibrium, if indeed the current situation can reasonably be interpreted as a (dynamic) equilibrium. I explore this idea in the context of an oversimplified model of the "Global Warming Game. "...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} that promote or {{mitigate}} transitions into self-employment is crucial to regional economic development efforts, {{while the number of}} new business <b>created</b> play <b>a</b> significant <b>role</b> <b>to</b> regional economic vitality and represent a major signal of a dynamic economy. We use a new measure of firm formation based on the combination between individual background with effects depending on the regional context in Tunisia such as entrepreneurial human capital and labour force characteristics. Even though some of these factors {{have been the subject of}} several entrepreneurship studies, it is still difficult to identify which one impact significantly the decision to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> new firm. As an illustration, the model is estimated using a data provided by the National Tunisian Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2010 Project, based on the analysis of a sample of 1966 cases. The main findings of the study show that “competencies” measured by the two variables “knowing someone personally who started a business in the past 2 years” and “presence of good opportunities for starting a business” increase significantly the probability to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> new venture. In addition, we have found that the interaction between these two factors has a positive influence. However, “fear of failure” influences negatively the decision to start up. Finally, some fixed region-specific factors notably the average real wage of a region must be accounted for when estimating regional self-employment relationships. We discuss the implications of our results for policy-makers with useful information in designing and implementing policies to promote enterprise development...|$|R

40|$|Humanitarian Intervention is a widely-debated {{doctrine}} {{of international law}} that is seen to be between law and non-law. It also touches upon principles of international law such as human rights, sovereignty and justice. It has invoked moral and ethical debates. This grey area of law has arguably produced moral, political and legal narratives about humanitarian intervention. These narratives {{can be seen in}} the context of the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999. This was a significant case of humanitarian intervention in the 1990 s as it involved the use of force by a group of states without the UNSC’s authorisation for the action. This thesis will set out the dominant moral, political and legal narratives produced in the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999. These different narratives are set out and analysed in chapters divided into moral, political and legal narratives on humanitarian intervention. These narratives will be identified from various discourse and texts of political actors, international lawyers, international institutions and scholars. The narratives will be analysed in terms of their effect and significance. Also, the issues and shortcomings of these storylines will be considered. It will be argued that these stories contributed to our constant fascination and resort to the {{doctrine of}} humanitarian intervention. Moral storylines were the most dominant in the Kosovo intervention. Moral and ethical reasoning was predominantly employed to support the intervention. Also, political narratives were important in justifying the humanitarian intervention in Kosovo. Therefore, legal arguments had less prominence in justifying the humanitarian intervention. As such, international lawyers and political actors turned to politics and morality instead of the law when justifying the humanitarian intervention in Kosovo. These moral, political and legal narratives produced by humanitarian intervention in Kosovo are complex and competing storylines. However, these stories are all linked and together produce an overarching storyline about humanitarian intervention. This overarching storyline is that humanitarian intervention is by an international community protecting the key values of human rights, morality, justice and peace. This action is vital and needed and the international community has a duty to intervene in these serious human rights violations that are the concern of all states. This overarching story can be seen to benefit the Western states who invoke this doctrine of humanitarian intervention. They are the states with the power and resources to undertake these humanitarian interventions in a humanitarian crisis in another state. Furthermore, the values that such storylines benefit are those of human rights, justice, peace and morality. These values are invoked throughout the different storylines. However, these values are defined by the Western international lawyers and political actors who adopt these narratives on intervention. Therefore, the stories arguably benefit Western values and ideals. As a result, the stories can be seen to elevate the West’s interests over other states. There is value in drawing this complex story about humanitarian intervention in Kosovo as it shows the significance of these narratives. These narratives are significant as they can be seen to present a desirable and favourable story about humanitarian intervention. So, one perspective on the significance of these narratives is that they make humanitarian intervention appear desirable. The narratives are also significant as they demonstrate how we think and speak about international law and how these stories contributed to the fascination and resort to the doctrine of humanitarian intervention by states. Furthermore, they show how we view international law and its limits. Also, they demonstrate how the actors who told such stories were relevant and <b>created</b> themselves <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>to</b> play in these humanitarian interventions. However, these narratives about humanitarian intervention only present a certain limited and favourable story about humanitarian intervention in Kosovo. These narratives have issues and shortcomings which are important to understand. Moral reasoning was dominant in the narratives on intervention, as such the narratives demonstrate the dangers of moral reasoning about the law. The stories are also employed by Western international lawyers and political actors and it is the powerful Western states who invoked this doctrine of humanitarian intervention. Therefore, the narratives highlight the issues of power politics and hegemonic politics involved in humanitarian intervention...|$|R
