40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Silicon {{photonics}} {{has emerged}} as a disruptive technology to address the exponentially growing demand for bandwidth in optical interconnects and data communications. The silicon material system supports large wafers, high device yield and performance uniformity, leveraging the half-century of investment by the electronics industry. Silicon is transparent in the 1. 3 - 1. 6 µm wavelength range, and has higher refractive index than its oxide, enabling submicron waveguides. On the other hand, the high index contrast between silicon and oxide, 3. 4 to 1. 4, making silicon photonic devices very sensitive to geometry variations commonly seen in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication. I demonstrate a design approach using coupled particle swarm optimization (PSO) and finite difference time domain (FDTD) method that produces highly compact, efficient and robust passive devices. Silicon also has a high thermo-optic coefficient, 1. 8 × 10 - 4 K- 1, making resonant devices, which are critical for wavelength filtering and multiplexing, sensitive to temperature perturbations that are common in practical environments. A universal stabilization approach based on bandgap temperature sensor and active feedback control is presented. In addition to passive devices, active device such as modulators, photodetectors, and lasers are needed for practical photonics integrated circuits (PICs). Electro-optic modulation in silicon can be achieved by free carrier plasma effect, typically implemented as reverse biased p-n junction overlapping with the waveguide mode. However lasing or photo detection is inherently not available in silicon, and is only possible by integrating other optically active materials. Germanium is the preferred absorber because of its CMOS compatibility, but germanium processing has received far less attention than silicon so far, with active ongoing research trying to understand its implantation, dopant diffusion, and metal <b>contact</b> <b>alloying</b> properties. Hence a photodetector that does not require doping or metallization of germanium is highly desirable. I propose and demonstrate a germanium-on-silicon photodetector using only intrinsic germanium and no metal-germanium contact, which significantly simplify the process flow. The detector shows 1. 14 A/W responsivity, over 40 GHz 3 dB bandwidth, and less than 1 µA dark current. I also demonstrate a hybrid-integrated laser based on Sagnac loop mirror and micro-ring wavelength filter with 44 dB side mode suppression ratio, 1. 2 MHz line-width, and 4. 8 mW on-chip output power. Compared to distributed Bragg grating based cavity, which require ultra-fine feature size, the Sagnac loop mirror is simple to fabricate, and provides accurately controlled transmittance (and reflectivity) with negligible excess loss. The toolbox of devices presented in this thesis includes, in summary: i. 	Highly efficient, compact, and robust Y-junctions and waveguide crossings, as well as an universal PSO-FDTD design methodology; ii. 	A floating germanium photodetector that is free from doping in Ge and direct Ge-metal contact, with high responsivity, high bandwidth and low dark current; iii. 	A Sagnac loop mirror and micro-ring based on-chip cavity configuration for laser integration; iv. 	A bandgap temperature sensor for resonance thermal stabilization. These address the unique challenges of building integrated photonics devices using CMOS-compatible material system, and, bring the vision of large-scale photonic integration on silicon an important step forward to practical application...|$|E

40|$|Performance {{requirements}} in high end microprocessors have increased tremendously {{in the last}} several years, leading to higher I/O counts and interconnect densities. As greater currents pass through the microprocessor interconnect, higher temperatures driven by Joule heating are expected to pose reliability risks to high pin count microprocessor sockets. In this study Joule heating and its effect on the reliability of stamped metal land grid array (LGA) sockets was investigated using a combination of experimental and numerical methods. A methodology to determine socket temperature environments under electrical loading was developed. Knowledge of socket operating temperatures can allow original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and socket manufacturers to test for and mitigate failure mechanisms under thermal aging. The factors that influence Joule heating and contribute to premature socket failure were examined. Processor temperature, <b>contact</b> <b>alloy</b> and <b>contact</b> pitch were all found to significantly influence socket temperatures driven by Joule heating, with the <b>contact</b> <b>alloy</b> and processor temperature having the most significant effects. The resulting temperatures at higher currents were found to significantly influence the mechanical properties of the polymer housing and adversely affect socket stress relaxation behavior. The properties of the polymer housing were found to be sensitive to temperature owing to its visco-elastic nature. Polymer housing relaxation was therefore identified as a principle contributor to failure in stamped metal sockets under high temperature environments. In {{the latter part of the}} study, numerical modeling was used to develop a methodology for assessing socket life expectancy under temperature and deformation loads. A full visco-elastic characterization of the polymer housing was conducted and the measured properties were subsequently used to model socket stress relaxation time to failure. The results of this study indicate that socket temperatures under electrical loading can be significantly higher than those called for by EIA test specifications for LGA sockets. Passing tests that are not stringent enough to account for worst case scenarios can pave the way for field failures. The methodology outlined in this dissertation may be used to determine socket temperature environments and their effect on socket life expectancy...|$|R

40|$|Fretting wear is an {{accumulation}} of damage that occurs at component interfaces that are subjected to high contact stresses coupled with low amplitude oscillation. The key to fretting wear reduction in metallic contacts is the mitigation of galling at the interface, followed by the control of debris production and the rheology of active wear debris. Once the thin surface species of the metallic interfaces is dispersed, adhesion between the contacting nascent surfaces causes the inception of severe surface deformation and material transfer or removal. This is extremely apparent in the fretting wear of aerospace materials such as titanium alloy and nickel <b>alloy</b> <b>contacts.</b> However, the literature suggests that nickel <b>alloy</b> <b>contacts</b> perform very well in sliding and reciprocating wear contacts at elevated temperatures due {{to the formation of}} what is often called a Glaze oxide layer.
