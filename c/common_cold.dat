5|$|Antibiotics have {{no effect}} against viral infections or against the viruses that cause the <b>common</b> <b>cold.</b> Due to their side effects, {{antibiotics}} cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some {{of the reasons that}} antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} the <b>common</b> <b>cold.</b> The primary methods of {{prevention}} are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and {{staying away from}} other sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. No cure for the <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> exists, but the symptoms can be treated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E
5|$|In {{studies of}} zinc {{supplements}} and the <b>common</b> <b>cold,</b> zinc acetate produced {{the most positive}} results, apparently because acetate does not bind zinc ions.|$|E
40|$|Four agents {{which were}} {{obtained}} from adults with <b>common</b> <b>colds</b> were cultivated and identified—one was influenza type B {{and the others were}} parainfluenza viruses of types 2 and 4. Their cultivation was assisted by the use of organ cultures of human embryo tracheal or nasal epithelium. They infected and caused typical <b>common</b> <b>colds</b> in volunteers...|$|R
40|$|In two {{instances}} of <b>common</b> <b>colds,</b> with no known contact with cases of pneumonia, Pneumococcus Type I {{was found to}} be the predominating organism, which strongly suggests that it was the etiological agent in these colds. If this is so, <b>common</b> <b>colds</b> of this type must be looked upon as a possible source of contagion in the development of lobar pneumonia due to the Type I pneumococcus...|$|R
50|$|ICAM-1 {{expressed}} by respiratory epithelial cells {{is also the}} binding site for rhinovirus, the causative agent of most <b>common</b> <b>colds.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{distinction}} between viral {{upper respiratory tract}} infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms with the <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> affecting primarily the nose, pharyngitis the throat, and bronchitis the lungs. However, there can be significant overlap and multiple areas can be affected. The <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> is frequently defined as nasal inflammation with varying amount of throat inflammation. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{lozenges}} {{have been}} used to treat symptoms, with some studies suggesting that they may reduce the duration of the <b>common</b> <b>cold.</b> Due to wide differences between the studies, further research may be needed to determine how and when zinc may be effective. Zinc lozenges may produce side effects, and there is only a weak rationale for physicians to recommend them as a treatment of the <b>common</b> <b>cold.</b> Some zinc remedies directly applied {{to the inside of the}} nose have led to the loss of the sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{supplements}} {{may help}} to reduce the frequency of colds. Routine vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk or severity of the <b>common</b> <b>cold,</b> though they may reduce its duration. Gargling with water was found useful in one small trial.|$|E
50|$|Common {{names in}} India include bukkan (Hindi), ratolia, vakkan (Marathi), podutalai (Tamil), vasir, and vasuka (Sanskrit). It is used medicinally to treat suppuration, <b>common</b> <b>colds,</b> and lithiasis.|$|R
40|$|As a {{possible}} treatment for <b>common</b> <b>colds,</b> we tested zinc gluconate lozenges in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. One 23 -mg zinc lozenge or matched placebo was dissolved {{in the mouth}} every 2 wakeful h after an initial double dose. After 7 days, 86 % of 37 zinc-treated subjects were asymptomatic, compared with only 46 % of 28 placebo-treated subjects (P = 0. 0005). Side effects or complaints were usually minor and consisted mainly of objectionable taste and mouth irritation. Zinc lozenges shortened the average duration of <b>common</b> <b>colds</b> by about 7 days...|$|R

5|$|His earlier {{books as}} Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his {{doctoral}} {{expertise in the}} field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, cocaine addiction, the <b>common</b> <b>cold,</b> and AIDS. He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> is {{the most}} common human disease and affects people all over the globe. Adults {{typically}} have two to five infections annually, and children may have six to ten colds a year (and up to twelve colds a year for school children). Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} infectious disease in humans. The average adult gets two to four colds a year, while the average child may get six to eight. They occur more commonly during the winter. These infections have been with humanity throughout history.|$|E
50|$|Most infections {{with human}} coronaviruses are mild and {{associated}} with <b>common</b> <b>colds.</b> The six coronaviruses known to infect humans {{are in the}} alpha and beta genera. Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome) are betacoronaviruses.|$|R
50|$|Routine supplementation with vitamin C is not justified, as it {{does not}} appear to be {{effective}} in reducing the incidence of <b>common</b> <b>colds</b> in the general population. The use of vitamin C in the inhibition and treatment of upper respiratory infections has been suggested since the initial isolation of vitamin C in the 1930s. Some evidence exists to indicate that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and/or cold environments. Given that vitamin C supplements are inexpensive and safe, people with <b>common</b> <b>colds</b> may consider trying vitamin C supplements in order to assess whether they are therapeutically beneficial in their case.|$|R
50|$|In Korea, {{the roots}} are {{commonly}} used for treating bronchitis, asthma, tuberculosis, diabetes, and other inflammatory diseases. In China, they are used as a cough suppressant and expectorant for <b>common</b> <b>colds,</b> cough, sore throat, tonsillitis, and chest congestion.|$|R
5|$|The {{economic}} impact of the <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total {{economic impact}} of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} many {{alternative}} treatments used for the <b>common</b> <b>cold,</b> there is insufficient scientific {{evidence to support the}} use of most. As of 2014 there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against honey. As of 2015 there is tentative evidence to support nasal irrigation.|$|E
5|$|Alligator and {{crocodile}} farming began {{because of}} demand for their hides, but now nearly {{all parts of the}} animal are put to use. The side and belly skin make the best leather, the meat is eaten, the gall bladders are valued in East Asia, and the heads are sometimes made into ornaments. In traditional Chinese medicine, alligator meat is said to cure the <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> and prevent cancer, while various internal organs are believed to have medicinal properties.|$|E
50|$|In Ayurvedic and Siddha practices, {{turmeric}} {{has been}} used as an attempted treatment for a variety of internal disorders, such as indigestion, throat infections, <b>common</b> <b>colds,</b> or liver ailments, as well as topically, to cleanse wounds or treat skin sores.|$|R
5000|$|Like many Lomatium species, {{this was}} also {{utilized}} by Native Americans. The flowers and leaves were dried and used to flavor meats, stews and salads while a tea brewed of the same parts was taken for <b>common</b> <b>colds</b> and sore throats.|$|R
40|$|During 1982, {{one of us}} (EV) {{observed}} {{in the course of}} health visiting that patients with cancer had <b>common</b> <b>colds</b> less frequently than patients with other diseases. A small case-control study of the relationship between history of <b>common</b> <b>colds</b> and cancer was carried out by this same observer and the results confirmed her previous observation. More recently Remy et al. (1983) carried out a similar study; from data given in their Figure 1, the relative risk of cancer is approximately 6 in individuals having an average of less than one cold per year over the 10 years before diagnosis compared to those having one or more colds per year.

5|$|In 1980, {{gastroenteritis}} {{from all}} causes caused 4.6 million deaths in children, {{with the majority}} occurring in the developing world. Death rates were reduced significantly (to approximately 1.5 million deaths annually) by the year 2000, {{largely due to the}} introduction and widespread use of oral rehydration therapy. In the US, infections causing gastroenteritis are the second most common infection (after the <b>common</b> <b>cold),</b> and they result in between 200 and 375million cases of acute diarrhea and approximately ten thousand deaths annually, with 150 to 300 of these deaths in children less than five years of age.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the <b>Common</b> <b>Cold</b> Unit {{was set up}} by the Medical Research Council in 1946 and it {{was where}} the {{rhinovirus}} was discovered in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prophylaxis and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment {{in the history of the}} unit.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> is a viral {{infection}} of the upper respiratory tract. The most commonly implicated virus is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronavirus (≈15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total over 200 viral types are associated with colds.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{relation}} between home dampness and respiratory symptoms among adults is well confirmed, but data on specific allergic diseases and respiratory infections is more limited. Individual {{factors that may}} enhance susceptibility {{to the effects of}} home dampness are mainly unknown.  METHODS—The association between home dampness and current physician diagnosed asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, <b>common</b> <b>colds,</b> and bacterial respiratory infections was studied in a questionnaire survey of 10 667 Finnish first year university students aged 18 - 25 years. The dampness categories analysed were visible mould and visible mould or damp stains or water damage during the last year. In multivariate analyses adjustment was made for parental education, active and passive smoking, type and place of residence, pets, and wall to wall carpets. The interaction effect of atopic heredity and dampness was investigated.  RESULTS—Visible mould or damp stains or water damage was reported by 15. 0 % of the respondents. In multivariate models there was a positive association between home dampness and current asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, as well as <b>common</b> <b>colds</b> ⩾ 4 times per year and other respiratory infections, but not between home dampness and allergic conjunctivitis. The strongest association was found between exposure to visible mould and asthma (OR 2. 21, 95 % CI 1. 48 to 3. 28) and <b>common</b> <b>colds</b> (OR 1. 49, 95 % CI 1. 18 to 1. 87). The risk of current asthma in damp homes was highest among subjects with atopic heredity.  CONCLUSIONS—The risk of current asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis was higher in damp homes. Of the respiratory infections, the risk of <b>common</b> <b>colds</b> was most clearly increased. ...|$|R

5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> is {{generally}} mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. Half of cases go away in 10days and 90% in 15days. Severe complications, if they occur, are {{usually in the}} very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>cold,</b> {{also known}} simply as a cold, is a viral {{infectious}} disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure. They include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days. Some symptoms may last up to three weeks. In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the <b>common</b> <b>cold,</b> influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is {{described in terms of}} virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E
