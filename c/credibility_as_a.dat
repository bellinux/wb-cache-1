5|$|In July 2012, Romney {{visited the}} United Kingdom, Israel, and Poland, meeting leaders {{in an effort}} to raise his <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> world statesman. Comments Romney made about the {{readiness}} of the 2012 Summer Olympics were perceived as undiplomatic by the British press. Israeli Prime Minister (and former BCG colleague) Benjamin Netanyahu, embraced Romney, though some Palestinians criticized him for suggesting that Israel's culture led to their greater economic success.|$|E
5|$|These early knives {{sold for}} between $800 and $2,000 each; that, {{combined}} with his appearances at knife shows and write-ups in knife magazines, helped Emerson gain status and <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> custom knifemaker. Once {{established as a}} serious and reputable maker, Emerson was soon able to concentrate on making the knives he wanted to make—knives designed for use as opposed to show, specifically folding-knives designed for combat.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was done}} to either secure or {{indicate}} how his succession was to take place; the Julians and their supporters had fallen to the wrath of Sejanus, and his own sons and immediate family were dead. Two of the candidates were either Caligula, the sole surviving son of Germanicus, or his own grandson, Tiberius Gemellus. However, only a half-hearted attempt {{at the end of}} Tiberius' life was made to make Caligula a quaestor, and thus give him some <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> possible successor, while Gemellus himself was still only a teenager and thus completely unsuitable for some years to come.|$|E

5|$|The 1859 {{publication}} of Darwin's theory in On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life is often considered the central {{event in the}} history of modern biology. Darwin's established <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> naturalist, the sober tone of the work, and most of all the sheer strength and volume of evidence presented, allowed Origin to succeed where previous evolutionary works such as the anonymous Vestiges of Creation had failed. Most scientists were convinced of evolution and common descent {{by the end of the}} 19th century. However, natural selection would not be accepted as the primary mechanism of evolution until well into the 20th century, as most contemporary theories of heredity seemed incompatible with the inheritance of random variation.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{management}} ran into unexpected financial problems, and the brief success soon withered. Only {{a few years}} later, they had to avert bankruptcy twice, which struck a blow to their <b>credibility,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mass desertion of the players ensued. The first line was a shambles as wing Risto Kerminen departed and center Jari Lindroos almost did, but though he had signed elsewhere, the contract was illegitimately nullified. Few others, apart from the longtime goaltender Rauli Sohlman, remained. Jokerit faced the imminent relegation in 1987.|$|E
25|$|In 1846, Baudelaire {{wrote his}} second Salon review, gaining {{additional}} <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> advocate and critic of Romanticism.

25|$|With {{active support}} from Uganda, Rwanda, and Angola, the Tutsi forces of Laurent-Désiré Kabila moved methodically down the Congo River, encountering only light {{resistance}} from the poorly trained, ill-disciplined forces of Mobutu's crumbling regime. The bulk of Kabila's fighters were Tutsis, and many were veterans of various conflicts in the Great Lakes region of Africa. Kabila himself had <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> long-time political opponent of Mobutu, and had been a follower of Patrice Lumumba (the first Prime Minister of the independent Congo), who was executed {{by a combination of}} internal and external forces in January 1961, to be replaced by Mobutu in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Professor Trelawney first {{appears in}} the third book of the series, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione start divination lessons. The friends {{generally}} believe Professor Trelawney is a fraud. However, Gryffindor students Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown are very fond of and impressed by her. According to Professor McGonagall, her <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Seer is undermined by her habit of erroneously predicting, each year, {{the death of one}} of her students. Her more profound predictions seem only to happen when she is in a trance and unaware of what she is saying, with no memory of it afterward. However, almost all her predictions were later to be shown true in the books even if she was not in a trance.|$|E
25|$|Stecher, {{although}} an able booker, {{was afraid of}} losing his championship, refusing to wrestle many contenders as a result. This {{made it impossible for}} the Trio to retrieve it. They responded by calling the Munn-Zbyszko match illegitimate, and reinstated Munn as champion, but quickly had him drop it to Lewis. This left two champions, Ed Lewis and Joe Stecher, who were regarded as the dominant wrestlers of the period. Stecher and Lewis agreed to a unification match years later, in 1928, when Stecher gave in and lost the title to Lewis. By this time, the Zbyszko double-cross had already caused irreparable damage, detracting from the Trio's dominance over the wrestling industry. In addition, the build-up of Munn followed by such a humiliating loss had devalued his title and <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> major wrestling superstar permanently.|$|E
50|$|Scientists are {{not just}} persuaded by logos or argument. Innovative {{initiatives}} in science test scientific authority by invoking the authority of past results (initial section of a scientific paper) and the authority of procedure, which establish the scientist's <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> investigator (Gross Starring 26-27).|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, Tyehimba Jess {{published}} a book titled [...] "Olio" [...] that includes the Fisk Jubilee Singers. Jess includes songs that the Fisk Jubilee Singers have never sung. Instead, he uses their <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> a capella group that is known for gospel songs to bolster his book. These fake documents {{that appear to be}} the Fisk Jubilee Singers' songs are used to enhance his loose collection of first generation freed African-American performers.|$|R
50|$|In {{regards to}} <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> eyewitness, {{adolescents}} {{are no longer}} easy to manipulate and are not suggestible like young children. This is due to obvious cognitive factors, as well <b>as</b> maturation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> person. Young children look at adults as powerful and extremely knowledgeable whereas adolescents are not so intimidated when questioned by adults.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to his specific critiques of neo-Darwinism, Koestler was opposed to {{what he saw as}} dangerous scientific reductionism more generally, including the behaviourism school of psychology, promoted in particular by B. F. Skinner during the 1930s. Koestler assembled a group of high-profile antireductionist scientists, including C. H. Waddington, W. H. Thorpe and Ludwig von Bertalanffy, for a meeting at his retreat in Alpbach in 1968. This was one of many attempts which Koestler made to gain acceptance within the mainstream of science, a strategy which brought him into conflict with individuals such as Peter Medawar who saw themselves as defending the integrity of science from outsiders. Although he never gained significant <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> scientist, Koestler published a number of works at the border between science and philosophy, such as Insight and Outlook, The Act of Creation and The Ghost in the Machine.|$|E

500|$|However, Biden {{did not see}} a rise in his {{poll numbers}} {{immediately}} after the Hart withdrawal, and was particularly stagnant in polls for the Iowa caucuses. [...] Nevertheless, Biden had confidence that he could prevail; {{on the eve of}} his announcement, he said: [...] "I'm going to win this thing. I really am. I just know it, I can feel it in my fingertips." [...] Some political professionals saw Biden as believing that he could simply will himself to win the race, but his continued ability to raise campaign funds gave him <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> candidate.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the course}} of his police service, Lambert {{infiltrated}} activist groups (environmentalists, animal rights activists and anti-racists) using the alias Mark [...] "Bob" [...] Robinson. To gain <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> activist, he formed friendships with other movement members; he also embarked in long-term relationships with women <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means of establishing a cover story.|$|R

500|$|Two sold-out solo {{acoustic}} concerts at Hollywood's Henry Fonda Theater, on January 31 and February 1, 2003, saw Smith {{attempting to}} reestablish his <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> live performer. Before the show, Smith scrawled [...] "Kali– The Destroyer" [...] (the Hindu goddess associated {{with time and}} change) in large block letters with permanent ink on his left arm, which was visible to the crowd during the performance. On several songs, he was backed by a stripped-down drum kit played by Robin Peringer (of the band 764-HERO), and on one track, members of opening band Rilo Kiley contributed backing vocals. Smith then played two more live shows in his adopted hometown: three months later at The Derby and once at the L.A. Weekly Music Awards in June.|$|E
500|$|In a September 2003 {{interview}} with website Whudat, T.I. {{talked about his}} contribution to Bow Wow's third album Unleashed and the song itself: [...] "Yeah this time around I wrote some songs for him. Even on the single, 'Let's Get Down'. I wrote the third verse and the hook. Usually how we did it was [...] he'll write one verse, Bow Wow would write one verse, his homeboy Rocka would write one, and I'd write a verse {{and come up with}} the hook." [...] In a 2009 {{interview with}} HipHopDX, Bow Wow commented on how getting T.I. to ghostwrite for him on his third album didn't tarnish his <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rapper, saying that he learned about the songwriting process by contributing about 85 percent to the album while T.I. wrote a full song and a couple verses to a few tracks.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Kapoor starred as {{a runaway}} bride in Dolly Ki Doli, a comedy co-starring Pulkit Samrat, Rajkummar Rao and Varun Sharma. Mints Udita Jhunjhunwala criticised Kapoor's {{performance}} in the film, writing that her [...] "range is too limited to bring alive a character that may have had heaps of potential on paper". Shubhra Gupta wrote: [...] "Kapoor is in almost every frame, and should have filled them all. But {{the treatment of the}} character shows up her limitations." [...] Despite the negative reviews for her performance, she was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. While filming SoorajR. Barjatya's Prem Ratan Dhan Payo with Salman Khan in Gondal, Gujarat in February 2015, Kapoor was diagnosed with swine influenza, from which she recovered the following month. Kapoor portrayed Rajkumari Maithili Devi, a princess looking for love. The film became one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time. She was praised by Rachit Gupta for her <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> royal, and Komal Nahta thought that the role was significant enough to be a turning point in her career. However, she won a Golden Kela Award for Worst Actress.|$|E
50|$|However, despite {{spending}} {{millions of dollars}} on publicity and public adoration, Sáez fell below 15% within six months, as the public became increasingly skeptical of her readiness for the presidency and she lost <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> anti-establishment candidate after accepting the endorsement of COPEI. An invitation analysts now see <b>as</b> <b>a</b> political trap for a candidate ahead of her times.|$|R
50|$|The Grand Alliance gained {{cultural}} and political <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> example of a possible European union. It was supported {{by most of the}} German territories, Britain and the Netherlands and by many French intellectuals who were disenchanted with the absolutist rule of Louis XIV. The eviction of the Huguenots in 1685 and the union of Catholicism and the French crown at home contributed to its formation.|$|R

This has been criticised by MP Sarah Wollaston and others who say it undermines his <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> impartial official. SABMiller was one of the drinks firms that opposed the introduction of minimum alcohol pricing, a policy which was considered by the Department of Health at the time.|$|R
500|$|Writer Richard Riegel {{evaluated}} the immediate impact of The Soft Parade on the Doors' {{reputation in the}} magazine Creem in 1981: [...] "If Waiting for the Sun set a lot of older hippies to questioning their former perceptions of the Doors as Avatars of the avant-garde, then The Soft Parade finished off their interest in the group." [...] In a review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger was slightly more positive, writing that [...] "about half the record is quite good, especially the huge hit 'Touch Me' (their most successful integration of orchestration)". However, Unterberger felt it is the [...] "weakest studio album recorded with Jim Morrison", as well as [...] "their weakest set of material, low lights including filler like 'Do It' and 'Runnin' Blue'". Compared to prior albums, Morrison's contributions to The Soft Parade were lackluster, putting his <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> serious poet and songwriter on the line according to writer James Riordan. Author Danny Sugerman in No One Here Gets Out Alive wrote [...] "overall the lyric impact was less {{than it had been}} on previous albums...horns by some of the top local studio jazz musicians further blurred the once-lucid Doors sound".|$|E
500|$|The Gateshead Games {{became an}} annual event, {{which gave the}} stadium <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> major {{sporting}} venue. In his managerial capacity with Gateshead Council, Foster was increasingly able to attract athletes to the games. In 1977, Foster had to intervene when BBC Radio Newcastle provided the wrong Ethiopian national anthem which, when played, offended Miruts Yifter sufficiently {{that he and his}} teammates started off towards Newcastle International Airport. The intervention worked—in the end, Foster asked Yifter and his teammates if they would sing the anthem themselves, which they did {{in the middle of the}} stadium—and Yifter returned to outclass a field including Steve Ovett over 5000m. The track was resurfaced by Regisport in 1982 and the venues' profile was further raised in the summer of 1983, when Gateshead-born athlete Steve Cram faced Sebastian Coe over 800m in the Gateshead Games. In front of a reported crowd of 15,000 who were [...] "shoehorned into the bowl" [...] and millions more watching on BBC's Sunday Grandstand, Cram prevailed to spark [...] "pandemonium" [...] in his final race before winning the gold medal at the 1983 World Athletics Championships in Helsinki.|$|E
500|$|Despite having {{details of}} its launch {{announced}} at an SNP political event, the newspaper {{has stated that}} it is politically independent of that party. Its inaugural editorial says that being a mouthpiece for the party [...] "would not be a healthy course to follow. We will be critical where appropriate and complimentary when merited." [...] But in The Guardian, Brooks suggested that launching The National at an SNP political rally [...] "might {{not have been the}} most auspicious of starts" [...] for the newspaper, while Labour peer George Foulkes quickly dubbed it [...] "McPravda", a reference to the political newspaper associated with the Communist Party of Russia. Damian Thompson, an associate editor with The Spectator, described the launch event as [...] "creepy". McIvor wrote that the calibre of its stablemates together with a respected editor had ensured The National was being taken seriously in political and media circles, but that the onus was on it to prove its <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> publication that supports independence rather than being viewed as [...] "a propaganda organ, a cynical business exercise or the old media equivalent of some pro-independence websites". Alan Roden, political editor of the Scottish Daily Mail, claimed it had [...] "rehashed SNP press releases" [...] and was too expensive for its size.|$|E

25|$|Bhumibol's {{refusal to}} endorse {{military}} coups in 1981 (the April Fool's Day coup) and 1985 (the Share Rebellion) {{ultimately led to}} the victory of forces loyal to the government, despite some violence – including, in 1981, the seizure of Bangkok by rebel forces. The coups led many to believe that Bhumibol had misjudged Thai society and that his <b>credibility</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> impartial mediator between various political and military factions had been compromised.|$|R
