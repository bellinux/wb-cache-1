She also said that she rejected their subsequent offers because they were nothing more than offers to sell their [...] "commercially available member mailing list" [...] and advertising space in their magazine and newsletter, which are available to anyone. The American Association for the Advancement of Science publication ScienceNOW published an assessment discussing both sides of the NSTA decision in which it was reported that [...] "David says NSTA's imprimatur [...] was essential and that buying a mailing list is a nonstarter. 'You don't want to send out a cold letter, and it <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money,' she says. 'There are a thousand reasons why that wouldn't work.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1978, Dylan {{embarked}} on a year-long world tour, performing 114 shows in Japan, the Far East, Europe and the US, to a total audience of two million. Dylan assembled an eight-piece band and three backing singers. Concerts in Tokyo in February and March were released as the live double album, Bob Dylan At Budokan. Reviews were mixed. Robert Christgau awarded the album a C+ rating, giving the album a derisory review, while Janet Maslin defended it in Rolling Stone, writing: [...] "These latest live versions of his old songs {{have the effect of}} liberating Bob Dylan from the originals." [...] When Dylan brought the tour to the U.S. in September 1978, the press described the look and sound as a 'Las Vegas Tour'. The 1978 tour grossed more than $20million, and Dylan told the Los Angeles Times that he had debts because [...] "I had a couple of bad years.

2500|$|Lower Than Atlantis was {{produced}} by Dan Lancaster, {{over the course of}} [...] "seven or eight months". The band brought Lancaster in because of his pop credentials, his heavy rock background and the ability to merge the two. After every recording session the group had a demo where they would re-record each instrument part-by-part. Lancaster would constantly attempt to get the best take every time, according to Duce: [...] "He'd be like: 'That was shit. You've got to do it again.' There's no bullshit." [...] Previously the band would worry if they made a mistake as it would <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to hire the studio and personnel, however, since the band had their own studio they took it at a leisurely pace.

2500|$|The Stargate {{itself is}} nearly always filmed against a {{blue or green}} backdrop, not only {{making it easier to}} paste the vortex imagery onto the scene, but also facilitating the {{superimposition}} of the [...] "event horizon ripple effect", which is entirely computer-generated. [...] However, if a shot only involves an open wormhole without anyone stepping through it, the crew may choose to use a [...] "practical puddle," [...] which is simply a back lit screen placed in the gate displaying a video of the wormhole effect. [...] This only works, however, on a darker set, as otherwise the projection will get washed out. [...] On occasion, the Stargate itself is also completely swapped out for a computer generated model, usually in cases where it is being moved, or is depicted in space. Series producer Robert C. Cooper explained that it often <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to erect a Stargate on location, and so in some cases offworld gates are also entirely a visual effect.|$|E
