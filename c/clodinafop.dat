40|$|In {{order to}} enhance the chances to rotate the {{herbicide}} molecules, {{the effectiveness of a}} new molecule, pinoxaden, was tested, comparing it with other herbicides used in wheat weed control. The trial was carried out comparing the following herbicide mixtures: 1) no weed control treatment; 2) Tribenuron Methyl (TM); 3) <b>Clodinafop</b> (C); 4) Tribenuron Methyl + <b>Clodinafop</b> (TM+C); 5) Pinoxaden + <b>clodinafop</b> + propargile (PCP); 6) Pinoxaden + <b>clodinafop</b> + propargile + Triasulfuron (PCP+T); 7) Pinoxaden + <b>clodinafop</b> + propargile + absolute Ioxinil and Mecoprop (PCP+IM). The new PCP+T herbicides mixture didn&rsquo;t differ statistically from the traditional TMC treatment in terms of effectiveness, but the agronomic result of the new mixture was totally satisfactory, even taking into account that the marketing of this mixture is not aimed to compete with other existing herbicides but to widen the chance to rotate active principles in time and space, in order to control the onset of resistance phenomena...|$|E

The layout was a completely randomized design with 4 replications. The combinations were applied in tillering stage. On the base of our results combination of iodosulfuron methyl-sodium plus mesosulfuron-methyl, or plus fenitrotion, or plus librel, and iodosulfuron methyl-sodium plus mesosulfuron-methyl, or plus fenitrotion caused the most reduction in wheat height by 20 % and 15 %, leaf area by 44 % and 39 %, leaf fresh weight by 40 % and 38 %, shoot fresh weight by 36 % and 32 %, leaf dry weight by 30 % and 25 % and shoot dry weight by 37 % and 29 %, respectively. Combination of tribenuron methyl plus <b>clodinafop</b> propargyl, or plus fenitrotion, or plus librel, and tribenuron methyl plus <b>clodinafop</b> propargyl, or plus fenitrotion reduced leaf area, fresh weight and dry weight of wheat plants, but this reduction was {{not as much as}} previous mixture.

To identify an appropriate adjuvant for pinoxaden and <b>clodinafop</b> propargyl herbicides against littleseed canarygrass (Phalaris minor Retz.), common wild oat (Avena fatua L.) and ryegrass (Lolium temulentum L.), three separate experiments were conducted under greenhouse conditions. In all experiments treatments consisted of five doses of pinoxaden and two doses {{of each of the}} three commercial formulations of <b>clodinafop</b> propargyl (Topik, Behpik & Karent), with and without the adjuvants Adigor, Citogate, Citohef and Volk. Performance of all herbicides increased with enhancing their concentrations against the tested plants except for <b>clodinafop</b> propargyl in case of wild oat. The addition of Volk (followed by Adigor) had the highest effect on pinoxaden efficacy against ryegrass and littleseed canarygrass, supporting the idea that either Volk or Adigor solubilizes the cuticular waxes thus facilitating their uptake. Adding Volk and Adigor had the highest and lowest influence on pinoxaden performance against wild oat, respectively. Totally, the adjuvant receptivity for pinoxaden was higher than for <b>clodinafop</b> propargyl.

40|$|Abstract Littleseed canarygrass (Phalaris minor Retz.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{troublesome}} weeds infesting wheat crop in India. Repeated use during the last two decades of the ACCase-inhibiting herbicide (<b>clodinafop)</b> to control this weed has resulted in the occurrence of resis-tance.

Instead, an Ile- 2, 041 -Asn substitution was found in resistant plants. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences revealed that Asn- 2, 041 ACCase alleles derived from several distinct origins. Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction associated the presence of Asn- 2, 041 with seedling resistance to APPs but not to CHDs. ACCase enzyme assays confirmed that Asn- 2, 041 ACCase activity was moderately resistant to CHDs but highly resistant to APPs. Thus, the Ile- 2, 041 -Asn substitution, which is located outside a domain previously shown to control sensitivity to APPs and CHDs in wheat (Triticum aestivum), is a direct cause of resistance to APPs only.

Therefore To predicting additive, synergism or antagonism effects mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron and clodinafop-propargyl two herbicides mixture on wild oat with isobole curvatures, greenhouse experimental in completely randomized design with 36 treatments (in dose-response arrangements) and four replicates for each experiment treatments were conducted at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Treatments included mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron alone at doses of 0, 2. 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 g ai ha- 1, <b>clodinafop</b> alone at doses of 0, 6. 4, 16, 32, 48 and 64 g ai ha- 1 and six mixtures ratio of doses of two herbicides above mentioned as 100 : 0 %, 75 : 25 %, 50 : 50 %, 25 : 75 %, 10 : 90 % and 0 : 100 %. The results showed mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron and clodinafop-propargyl at high dose rates showed complete control of wild oat. In addition Concentration Addition (CA) model describe Fitted the data better than Hewlett and Voelund models. On the other hand, herbicides combination with each other showed additive effects on wild oat control, As by increasing the clodinafop-propargyl ratio in mixtures (90 % clodinafop-propargyl + 10 % mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron) increased wild oat control compared with other mixing ratios remarkably...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In 2010, {{a survey}} was {{conducted}} in the wheat fields of a typical cereal-producing region of Greece to establish the frequency and distribution of herbicide-resistant littleseed canarygrass (Phalaris minor Retz.). In total, 73 canarygrass accessions were collected and screened in a field experiment with several herbicides commonly used to control this weed. Most of the weed populations were classed as resistant (or developing resistance) to the acetyl-CoA varboxylase (ACCase) -inhibiting herbicide diclofop, while resistance to <b>clodinafop</b> was markedly lower. The results of the pot experiments showed {{that some of the}} canary populations were found to have a very high level of diclofop resistance (resistance index up to 12. 4), while cross resistance with other herbicides was also com-mon. The levels of resistance and cross resistance patterns among populations varied along with the different amounts and times of selection pressure. Such variation indicated either more than one mechanism of resistance or different resistance mutations in these weed populations. The population which had the highest diclofop resistance level, showed resistance to all aryloxyphenoxypropinate (APP) herbicides applied and non-ACCase inhibitors. Alternative ACCase-inhibiting herbicides, such as pinoxaden remain effective on the majority of the tested canarygrass populations, while the acetolactate synthase (ALS) -inhibiting herbicide mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron could also provide some solutions. Consequently, there is an opportunity to effectively control canarygrass by select-ing {{from a wide range of}} herbicides. It is the integration of agronomic practices with herbicide application, which helps in effective management of P. minor and particularly its resistant populations.

40|$|Scentless {{chamomile}} is a noxious weed in the Canadian prairies and has natural {{tolerance to}} most post-emergent herbicides. A fungal pathogen, Colletotrichum truncatum, {{was identified as}} a potential biocontrol agent with moderate efficacy when broadcast at a spore concentration of 7 x 106 spores ml- 1 and a water volume of 200 L ha- 1. In this study, potential synergy of herbicides with the fungus was investigated by tank-mix applications in the greenhouse. Most of the herbicides tested at full label rates delayed fungal spore germination temporarily, but this inhibition was not observed after 24 hr incubation. On scentless chamomile, the efficacy of the herbicide influenced the interaction between fungus and herbicide, with less effective products more likely exhibiting synergy although weed control might not be optimum. Clopyralid plus MCPA ester and metribuzin provided more effective scentless chamomile control when applied with the fungus and provided ideal tank mixes at the 8 -leaf and 11 -leaf stages, respectively. The addition of <b>clodinafop</b> to clopyralid plus MCPA ester plus the fungus did not further improve control of scentless chamomile, but this tank-mix option may be practical for targeting a broad weed spectrum in cereals. Increasing fungal dose generally enhanced biocontrol efficacy, but this effect eased rapidly at higher doses. The addition of synergistic herbicides helped alleviate the high fungal dose required for weed control. There were no major differences in herbicide interaction among six fungal isolates tested, with metribuzin and clopyralid plus MCPA ester consistently exhibiting the highest weed control with all the isolates. Field trials with appropriate formulations are needed to validate the feasibility of this control strategy for scentless chamomile in the prairie climate...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} at Tobacco Research Station Khan Ghari, Mardan, (NWFP) - Pakistan during spring 2003 to study the impact of herbicides on some agronomic and chemical characteristics of flue-cured virginia (FCV) tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). The experiment was laid out in RCB design, replicated four times with ten treatments, comprising hand weeding, weedy check, pre-transplanting herbicides; S-metalocholar @ 1. 92, pendimethalin (EC) @ 1. 00, pendimethalin (CS) @ 1. 00, and butralin @ 1. 44 kg a. i ha- 1 and the post-transplanting herbicides include; <b>clodinafop</b> @ 0. 04, fenoxaprop-p-ethyl @ 1. 00, acetochlor @ 0. 125 and glyphosate @ 0. 95 kg a. i ha- 1. None of the herbicides except S-metalocholar had a phytotoxic effect on tobacco. All the parameters except the number of leaves plant- 1 were significantly affected by different treatments. The highest (228. 3) weeds density m- 2 was observed in weedy check while minimum (69) was recorded in pendimethalin (EC) treatment. The maximum grade index of 74. 60 % was recorded in acetochlor and minimum grade index of 53. 88 % was recorded in S-metalocholar treatments. Nicotine (%) was higher in pendimethalin (EC) treated plots with 2. 362 %; however it was comparable to all other treatments. The maximum percent reducing sugar of 18. 22 % was recorded in pendimethalin (CS) treatment, while minimum of 12. 42 % reducing sugar was recorded in weedy check. Similarly maximum yield of 2465 kg ha- 1 was recorded in pendimethalin (EC) treatment and minimum yield of 1703 kg ha- 1 was recorded in weedy check (control) treatment. Thus {{it can be concluded}} from the experiment that herbicides proved effective against weeds and their growth and promoted tobacco quality and yield. Hence the use of herbicides not only increases the net income of the farmers but also will make the weed seed bank poorer...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the results of}} over fifteen years of {{experimentation}} are summarized, concerning the possibility of use of herbicides included in several chemical classes and with various mechanisms of action on poplar clones of different species, European and North American. The active ingredients were tested mainly singly or in commercial mixtures as well, applied before emergence (interpreted here as sprout of poplar cuttings not yet occurred and before weed infestation) or after emergence (interpreted here as cuttings with sprouts 20 - 25 cm long and after weed colonisation). Almost 50 % of the 43 tested formulations {{has proved to be}} unserviceable in poplar nursery because of the hard damage induced on plantlets, i. e. dicotyledonicides and those with a wide action range, especially applied after emergence. It was the case of acetolactate synthase inhibitors and synthetic auxins. About 25 % of formulations has proved to be utilizable with limited risks and 20 % without risk. After emergence, the lowest damage was caused by graminicide compounds included in the class of acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors (e. g. diclofop-methyl, cycloxydim); before emergence, very good applicative opportunities were showed by microtubule assembly inhibitors, especially propyzamide, and the cellulose synthesis inhibitor isoxaben. Among the herbicides utilizable with some risk after emergence, the photosynthesis inhibitors pyridate and phenmedipham (singly or in mixture) were interesting since they are the only ones that allow the control of broad-leaved weeds in the presence of herbaceous poplar shoots. Before emergence, flufenacet and isoxaflutole were remarkable as well, the latter being active versus hardly limited weeds. In summary, besides the two aforesaid compounds, the graminicide cycloxydim and - more cautiously - <b>clodinafop</b> and propaquizafop may be hopefully introduced in poplar nurseries after emergence, in association with the wide action range mixture of phenmedipham, desmedipham and ethofumesate...|$|E
40|$|The acetyl-coenzyme A {{carboxylase}} (ACCase) -inhibiting cyclohexanedione herbicide clethodim is used {{to control}} grass weeds infesting dicot crops. In Australia clethodim is widely used to control the weed Lolium rigidum. However, clethodim-resistant Lolium populations have appeared over the last 5 years and now are present in many populations across the western Australian wheat (Triticum aestivum) belt. An aspartate- 2078 -glycine (Gly) mutation in the plastidic ACCase enzyme {{has been identified as}} the only known mutation endowing clethodim resistance. Here, with 14 clethodim-resistant Lolium populations we revealed diversity and complexity in the molecular basis of resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides (clethodim in particular). Several known ACCase mutations (isoleucine- 1781 -leucine [Leu], tryptophan- 2027 -cysteine [Cys], isoleucine- 2041 -asparagine, and aspartate- 2078 -Gly) and in particular, a new mutation of Cys to arginine at position 2088, were identified in plants surviving the Australian clethodim field rate (60 g ha− 1). Twelve combination patterns of mutant alleles were revealed in relation to clethodim resistance. Through a molecular, biochemical, and biological approach, we established that the mutation 2078 -Gly or 2088 -arginine endows sufficient level of resistance to clethodim at the field rate, and in addition, combinations of two mutant 1781 -Leu alleles, or two different mutant alleles (i. e. 1781 -Leu/ 2027 -Cys, 1781 -Leu/ 2041 -asparagine), also confer clethodim resistance. Plants homozygous for the mutant 1781, 2078, or 2088 alleles were found to be clethodim resistant and cross resistant to a number of other ACCase inhibitor herbicides including <b>clodinafop,</b> diclofop, fluazifop, haloxyfop, butroxydim, sethoxydim, tralkoxydim, and pinoxaden. We established that the specific mutation, the homo/heterozygous status of a plant for a specific mutation, and combinations of different resistant alleles plus herbicide rates all are important in contributing to the overall level of herbicide resistance in genetically diverse, cross-pollinated Lolium species...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} determination of selected maize and grain herbicides (amidosulfuron, N-([{[(4, 6 -dimethoxy- 2 -pyrimidinyl) amino]carbonyl}amino) sulfonyl]-N-methylmethanesulfonamide; bentazone, 3 -(1 -methylethyl) - 1 H- 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazin- 4 (3 H) -one 2, 2 -dioxide; 2, 4 -D, (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid; MCPA, (4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxy) acetic acid; metosulam, N-(2, 6 '-dichloro- 3 -methylphenyl) - 5, 7 -dimethoxy[1, 2, 4]triazolo[1, 5 -a]pyrimidine- 2 -sulfonamide) and their transformation products (TPs) (8 -hydroxybentazone, 1 H- 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazin- 4 (3 H) -one, 8 -hydroxy- 3 -(1 -methylethyl) - 2, 2 -dioxide; bifenox acid, 5 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) - 2 -nitrobenzoic acid; <b>clodinafop</b> acid; 2, 4 -dichlorophenol; 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenol) in environmental waters was developed. The procedure combines a solid-phase extraction (SPE) with column liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection utilizing a pneumatically assisted and heat-assisted electrospray interface in negative mode. The extraction of analytes from filtered drainage or river water samples was performed using as sorbent a graphitized carbon. The recovery, for drinking water, ranged from 91 to 98 %, and from 84 to 95 % for river water. Excellent method precision was demonstrated with percent {{relative standard deviation}} of less than 10 % for all analytes at fortification level. Detection limits were at level of few nanograms per liter, except for 2, 4 -dichlorophenol and 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenol, {{that was in the}} range of tens of nanogram per liter. The present methodology was used for searching in river and drainage waters of maize-grain fields of the Tiber valley, during a typical period of herbicides application from April to July 2001. The levels detected of four compounds were in the range of: non-detectable (ND) - 6. 1, ND- 27, ND- 1. 9 and ND- 0. 5 mug l(- 1), for MCPA, bentazone, 8 -hydroxybentazone and 2, 4 -D, respectively. Detectable amounts of bentazone- 8 -hydroxy at level of 0, 3 mug l(- 1) was found to be transported into river. The highly satisfactory results for all target analytes demonstrate the potential of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the identification and the quantification of the polar and acidic herbicides at below 100 ng l(- 1) levels.
