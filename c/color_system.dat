25|$|When {{color was}} introduced, West Germany chose {{a variant of}} the NTSC <b>color</b> <b>system,</b> {{modified}} by Walter Bruch and called PAL. East Germany accepted the French SECAM system, which was used in Eastern European countries.

50|$|The first <b>color</b> <b>systems</b> that {{appeared}} in motion pictures were additive <b>color</b> <b>systems.</b> Additive <b>color</b> was practical because no special color stock was necessary. Black-and-white film could be processed and used in both filming and projection. The various additive systems entailed the use of color filters on both the movie camera and projector. Additive color adds lights of the primary colors in various proportions to the projected image. Because of the limited amount of space to record images on film, and later because {{the lack of a}} camera that could record more than two strips of film at once, most early motion-picture <b>color</b> <b>systems</b> consisted of two colors, often red and green or red and blue.|$|R
25|$|Windows Vista also {{provides}} improved color support through the Windows <b>Color</b> <b>System</b> for higher color precision and dynamic range. It also supports CMYK colorspace and multiple ink systems for higher print fidelity. The print subsystem also has support for named colors simplifying color definition for images transmitted to printer supporting those colors.|$|E
25|$|First {{published}} in 1905, the Munsell <b>color</b> <b>system</b> became {{the foundation for}} a series of color models, providing objective methods for the measurement of color. The Munsell system describes a color in three dimensions, hue, value (lightness), and chroma (color purity), where chroma is the difference from gray at a given hue and value.|$|E
25|$|While rivals CBS and the DuMont Television Network {{also had}} plans to begin {{offering}} color television broadcasts, RCA convinced the FCC to approve its <b>color</b> <b>system</b> in December 1953. NBC was ready with color programming {{within days of the}} Commission's decision. NBC began the transition with a few shows in 1954, and broadcast its first program to air all episodes in color beginning that summer, The Marriage.|$|E

25|$|On August 11, 1951, CBS' {{flagship}} {{television station}} WCBS-TV in New York City broadcast the first baseball game ever televised in color between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Braves from Ebbets Field, {{in which the}} Braves beat the Dodgers 8â€“1. As were all color programs at the time, it was transmitted via a field-sequential <b>color</b> <b>system</b> developed by CBS. Signals transmitted this way could not be seen on existing black-and-white sets.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista {{features}} Windows <b>Color</b> <b>System</b> (WCS), {{a platform}} for color management. Its goal is to obtain color consistency across various software and hardware, including cameras, monitors, printers and scanners. Different devices interpret the same colors differently, according to their software and hardware configurations. As a result, they must be properly calibrated to reproduce colors consistently across different devices. WCS aims to make this process of color calibration automatic and transparent, as an evolution of ICC Color Profiles.|$|E
25|$|By 1949, the {{networks}} stretched from New York to the Mississippi River, and by 1951 to the West Coast. Commercial color television broadcasts began on CBS in 1951 with a field-sequential <b>color</b> <b>system</b> that was suspended {{four months later}} for technical and economic reasons. The television industry's National Television System Committee (NTSC) developed a color television system based on RCA technology that was compatible with existing black and white receivers, and commercial color broadcasts reappeared in 1953.|$|E
50|$|Systems {{that use}} {{additive}} color processes {{usually have a}} color gamut which is roughly a convex polygon in the hue-saturation plane. The vertices of the polygon are the most saturated <b>colors</b> the <b>system</b> can produce. In subtractive <b>color</b> <b>systems,</b> the <b>color</b> gamut is more often an irregular region.|$|R
40|$|The {{precision}} of satellite ranging systems, limited {{in part by}} atmospheric refraction and scattering, is examined. The effects of atmospheric turbulence on the accuracy of single color and multicolor ranging systems is discussed. The statistical characteristics of the random path length fluctuations induced by turbulence are examined. Correlation and structure functions are derived using several proposed models for the variations of the optical path length. For single <b>color</b> <b>systems</b> it is shown that the random path length fluctuations can limit the accuracy of a range measurement to a few centimeters. Two <b>color</b> <b>systems</b> can partially correct for the random path fluctuations so that in most cases their accuracy {{is limited to a}} few millimeters. However, at low elevation angles and over long horizontal paths two <b>color</b> <b>systems</b> can also have errors approaching a few centimeters...|$|R

25|$|In 1939, Hungarian {{engineer}} Peter Carl Goldmark {{introduced an}} electro-mechanical system while at CBS, which contained an Iconoscope sensor. The CBS field-sequential <b>color</b> <b>system</b> was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, {{and a similar}} disc spinning in synchronization {{in front of the}} cathode ray tube inside the receiver set. The system was first demonstrated to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on August 29, 1940, and shown to the press on September 4.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} of the Swedish flag are 5:2:9 horizontally and 4:2:4 vertically. The {{dimensions of}} the Swedish flag with a triple-tail are 5:2:5:8 horizontally and 4:2:4 vertically. The colors of the flag are officially established through the Natural <b>Color</b> <b>System</b> to be NCS 0580-Y10R for the shade of yellow, and NCS 4055-R95B for the shade of blue. The square-cut Swedish state flag {{is identical to the}} civil ensign. The Swedish law does not regulate the design of the Swedish pennant, but it is recommended that its color scheme should correspond with that of the flag.|$|E
25|$|These {{markings}} {{were effective}} {{within a mile}} of the viewer, but as the numbers of groups increased from sixteen to forty, assembly difficulties increased. In February 1944 the USAAF decided to discontinue further camouflage painting of its aircraft, and the 2nd Bomb Division devised a system for its B-24s whereby the entire tail fin was painted in a color (each of its five combat wings was assigned a color) and a black or white band placed across the fin either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally to identify the group within that wing. The 93rd CBW of the 3rd Air Division, which operated B-24s from May to September 1944, also adopted a <b>color</b> <b>system</b> in June.|$|E

50|$|While many {{of these}} films were printed by <b>color</b> <b>systems,</b> {{none of them was}} {{actually}} in color, {{and the use of the}} color printing was only to achieve an anaglyph effect.|$|R
25|$|Monopack color {{films are}} based on the {{subtractive}} <b>color</b> <b>system,</b> which filters colors from white light by using superimposed cyan, magenta and yellow dye images. Those images are created from records of the amounts of red, green and blue light present at each point of the image formed by the camera lens. A subtractive primary color (cyan, magenta, yellow) is what remains when one of the additive primary colors (red, green, blue) has been removed from the spectrum. Eastman Kodak's monopack color films incorporated three separate layers of differently color sensitive emulsion into one strip of film. Each layer recorded one of the additive primaries and was processed to produce a dye image in the complementary subtractive primary.|$|E
25|$|Pure {{pigments}} reflect {{light in}} a very specific way that cannot be precisely duplicated by the discrete light emitters in a computer display. However, by making careful measurements of pigments, close approximations can be made. The Munsell <b>Color</b> <b>System</b> provides a good conceptual explanation of what is missing. Munsell devised a system that provides an objective measure of color in three dimensions: hue, value (or lightness), and chroma. Computer displays in general are unable to show the true chroma of many pigments, but the hue and lightness can be reproduced with relative accuracy. However, when the gamma of a computer display deviates from the reference value, the hue is also systematically biased.|$|E
25|$|VIII Fighter Command {{assigned}} the 56th Fighter Group two-letter squadron identification codes {{to be painted}} on the fuselages of its fighters, and each squadron assigned its aircraft individual letter identifiers. (The letters chosen for the 56th had previously been assigned to the 1st Fighter Group before {{it went to the}} Twelfth Air Force.) In early February 1944 the 56th replaced its white cowl bands with a different color for each squadron. This innovation lasted until mid-March, when VIII Fighter Command adopted a <b>color</b> <b>system</b> for all Eighth Air Force fighter groups. The 56th painted its noses red and later applied the squadron colors to the tail rudders of its Thunderbolts, an innovation that VIII Fighter Command also borrowed. The 56th discontinued use of squadron colors when it changed to P-47M's.|$|E

40|$|The {{computer}} modelling of projection TV screen with additive and subtractive multicolor formation was made. The neutral polarizers with phase compensator films {{were shown to}} be suitable for LC subtractive <b>color</b> <b>systems</b> instead of <b>color</b> polarizers. The advantages of such construction of subtractive <b>color</b> <b>systems</b> include the application of three identical STN cells. This approach considerably simplifies the technology and results in a lower price of the <b>color</b> projection <b>systems.</b> The additive LC screen can be also produced {{on the basis of}} neutral polarizers and phase retardation plates instead of the conventionally used microfilters. The phase retardation plates can be generated, using photoanisotropic polymer films. According to calculations, the proposed construction of an additive LC screen enable to increase the brightness several times as much as compared with usual configurations...|$|R
30|$|There exist several <b>color</b> <b>systems,</b> for {{different}} purposes: RGB (for displaying process), XYZ (for color standardization), rgb, xyz (for color normalization and representation), CieL*u*v*, CieL*a*b* (for perceptual uniformity), HSV (intuitive description) [2, 32].|$|R
25|$|Windows <b>Color</b> <b>System</b> {{is based}} on a {{completely}} new Color Infrastructure and Translation Engine (CITE). It is backed up by a new color processing pipeline that supports bit-depths more than 32 bits per pixel, multiple color channels (more than 3), alternative color spaces and high dynamic range coloring, using a technology named Kyuanos developed by Canon. The color processing pipeline allows device developers to add their own gamut mapping algorithm into the pipeline to customize the color response of the device. The new pipeline also uses floating point calculations to minimize round-off losses, which are inherent in integer processing. Once the color pipeline finishes processing the colors, the CITE engine applies a color transform according to a color profile, specific to a device to ensure the output color matches to what is expected.|$|E
25|$|The {{creators of}} HSL and HSV {{were far from}} the first to imagine colors fitting into conic or spherical shapes, with neutrals running from black to white in a central axis, and hues {{corresponding}} to angles around that axis. Similar arrangements {{date back to the}} 18th century, and continue to be developed in the most modern and scientific models. A pair of the most influential older models are Philipp Otto Rungeâ€™s 1810 Farbenkugel (color sphere), and the early-20th-century Munsell <b>color</b> <b>system.</b> Albert Munsell began with a spherical arrangement in his 1905 book A Color Notation, but he wished to properly separate color-making attributes into separate dimensions, which he called hue, value, and chroma, and after taking careful measurements of perceptual responses, he realized that no symmetrical shape would do, so he reorganized his system into a lumpy blob.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the great}} {{technical}} challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth, potentially three {{times that of the}} existing black-and-white standards, and not use an excessive amount of radio spectrum. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee approved an all-electronic Compatible <b>color</b> <b>system</b> developed by RCA, which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.|$|E
