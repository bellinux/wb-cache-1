25|$|Dumbledore {{appears in}} {{an episode of}} Icons of Teen from the YouTube channel, Shut Up Cartoons voiced by Justin Roiland. As a teenager, Dumbledore liked to do magic and make robotic copies of himself. One day, he went scuba diving to earn his scuba diving badge for scouts. Dumbledore gets scared and stays on the boat while his crush Charlene and the scoutmaster go diving. They run into a giant sea monster and Charlene <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> says Dumbledore, a trick he taught her. Dumbledore {{receives}} her distress signal and dives in after them. He meets a talking dolphin who agrees to help Dumbledore if he can eat him in the end. Dumbledore suggests he eat the scoutmaster and the dolphin takes him to his friends. Dumbledore makes a robotic copy and sends it into the creature's stomach, distracting the creature long enough for Dumbledore, Charlene and the scoutmaster to escape. Charlene thanks Dumbledore for saving them. Dumbledore makes a sexual comment but plays it off like she said it. Charlene asks where the scoutmaster is; Dumbledore says he's gone somewhere, when really the dolphin ate him. Dumbledore then decides to build a robot copy of the scoutmaster to prevent anyone from finding {{out what happened to}} him.|$|E
2500|$|When Dorothy leaves Oz {{after having}} several adventures there and befriending many of Oz's natives, she is magically carried over the Deadly Desert {{by means of}} the charmed Silver Shoes she had been given shortly after her {{unexpected}} arrival when her farmhouse landed on and killed the previous pair's owner, the Wicked Witch of the East. After knocking her heels together three times and wishing to return home, Dorothy is lifted into the air and transported to Kansas. The shoes however, slip off of Dorothy's feet and are lost forever in the desert. Baum states the silver shoes are never recovered. In the 1939 film the shoes are changed to Ruby Slippers. When Dorothy clicks her heels together she <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> says: [...] "Theres no place like home". She then wakes up in her bedroom in Kansas believing her experience in Oz to be an elaborate dream.|$|E
2500|$|Pe'er {{originally}} {{played with}} a [...] "counter-puncher" [...] style, but by 2010 she had adopted a more attacking style of play. Her forehand uses a semi-western grip, which makes her good in facing big top-spin opponents. Her backhand is two-handed {{and is one of}} the best on the women's tour. It is consistent and finds various angles throughout the court. She loves to take lots of points with the inside out shot on her backhand. She originally used a kick serve that lacked the drive needed to penetrate deep, but she changed it to more of a slice serve, which works great for her now and even generates aces. She has a good volley and doesn't have a problem going to the net. During matches, she often turns her back to her opponent between points, faces the back of the court, <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> tries to wipe the mental slate clean.|$|E
60|$|Once {{he pressed}} his lips lightly upon her forehead, {{and she did not}} move, but <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> sighed.|$|R
60|$|Violet vaguely {{perceived}} something amiss; but {{too weak}} to think about it, <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> fell into a doze.|$|R
60|$|A sudden {{illuminating}} {{flash of}} horror {{told her the}} truth. She <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> tried to run from the room.|$|R
6000|$|The doctors of {{medicine}} have discovered that certain dreams of the night, for I do not grant them all, are the day's unfulfilled desire, and that our terror of desires condemned by the conscience has distorted and disturbed our dreams. They have only studied the breaking into dream of elements that have remained unsatisfied without purifying discouragement. We can satisfy in life {{a few of our}} passions and each passion but a little, and our characters indeed but differ because no two men bargain alike. The bargain, the compromise, is always threatened, and when it is broken we become mad or hysterical or are in some way deluded; and so when a starved or banished passion shows in a dream we, before awaking, break the logic that had given it the capacity of action and throw it into chaos again. But the passions, when we know that they cannot find fulfilment, become vision; and a vision, whether we wake or sleep, prolongs its power by rhythm and pattern, the wheel where the world is butterfly. We need no protection, but it does, for if we become interested in ourselves, in our own lives, we pass out of the vision. Whether it is we or the vision that create the pattern, who set the wheel turning, it is hard to say, but certainly we have a hundred ways of keeping it near us: we select our images from past times, we turn from our own age and try to feel Chaucer nearer than the daily paper. It compels us to cover all it cannot incorporate, and would carry us when it comes in sleep to that moment when even sleep <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> dreams begin to dream; and we are taken up into a clear light and are forgetful even of our own names and actions and yet in perfect possession of ourselves murmur like Faust, [...] "Stay, moment," [...] and murmur in vain.|$|E
50|$|A daydreamer, Georgie Allerton's {{imagination}} goes to {{work while}} she {{falls in love with}} her sister Miriam's husband-to-be, Jim Lucas. She <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> has a fantasy of what life with Ji would be like, ignoring the genuine attentions of Clark Redfield, an honest but poor newspaper reporter.|$|E
50|$|On {{the same}} bridge from which Kallie peered earlier, Danette <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> counts as playing hide-and-seek, hoping her {{daughter}} will arrive.

Twitch sits on the roof of his apartment building and ponders the drugs, before he tosses them away.|$|E
60|$|She half <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> laughed {{softly to}} herself, moving {{her head like}} a child, as though from sheer pleasure.|$|R

50|$|As {{the woman}} reaches {{the bottom of}} the stairs, she looks {{straight}} into the lens. The expression on her face changes to the one of wide-eyed horror that was displayed on the faces of the man and woman outside. She <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> collapses. E checks on where the man had been, but O has made his escape. His coat tails are seen flying up the stairs.|$|E
5000|$|A {{series of}} books {{following}} the exploits of a fifth grade female detective named Jennifer [...] "Cam" [...] Jansen {{and her best friend}} Eric. Nicknamed Cam for her photographic memory, the protagonist <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> says [...] "click" [...] at various points in a story, mimicking the noise of a camera while memorizing a scene in front of her. She later recalls these scenes to aid in solving a mystery. The Cam Jansen character was based on an elementary school classmate of Adler's who was believed to have a photographic memory.|$|E

5000|$|As Zoe leads Jayne and Wash {{toward the}} torture room, Book, Simon, and Kaylee stay behind {{to prevent the}} station {{personnel}} from taking the ship. While Book and Simon hold their own, Kaylee is emotionally unable to attack, and retreats when pressed by enemy gunfire. River, who has {{stayed out of the}} gunfight until this point, appears and takes Kaylee's pistol. After a quick glimpse at the three attackers, River emerges, <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> kills the enemy troops with three rapid, precise shots. She then proudly tells Kaylee [...] "No power in the 'verse can stop me.", mimicking Kaylee from the earlier apple incident. Kaylee looks at River, clearly horrified.|$|E
5000|$|Spider-Man in {{this series}} was again voiced by Paul Soles who {{previously}} voiced him in the 1960s Spider-Man series, some similarities in the two series still remained. Perhaps the most noticeable similarity is [...] "animated stock footage", where - before any episodes were completed - an animated sequence was created. This sequence would be used with an appropriate background added, whenever the need would arise. One example is Spider-Woman turning around, from back to front. Another example is where Jessica Drew gets a [...] "spider-sense", turns her head while she <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> then the location of danger appears using an editing technique.|$|E

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the film, a mobile cinema brings Frankenstein to the village and the two sisters go to see it. Ana finds the film more interesting than frightening, particularly the scene where the monster plays benignly with a little girl, then accidentally kills her. She asks her sister, [...] "Why did he kill the girl, and why did they kill him after that?" [...] Isabel tells her that the monster didn't kill the girl and isn't really dead; she says that everything in films is fake. Isabel says the monster is like a spirit, and Ana can talk to him if she <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> calls him: [...] "It's me, Ana." ...|$|E
50|$|As Christy {{blows out}} the twenty-six candles on her {{birthday}} cake, she <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> makes a wish. Could this be the year that she and Todd have a baby?

5000|$|... 20. Kathy: Kathy hates everyone, {{especially}} the reader (even though she hasn't met the reader), and she hates everybody {{all for a}} specific excuse (with the exception of Sammy, who, as it was revealed six chapters earlier, was a dead rat). It is indicated that she actually creates the excuses by her own actions; she is hit in the face by a ball from Dameon because she <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> allows it to hit her, and she dislikes Alison's cookies because one that Kathy left in her own desk for three years became stale and old. She also locks her cat in her closet {{to prevent it from}} running away, but in a few days when she opens her closet, her cat does run away, and Kathy threats that she'll never get another cat as long as she lives. That was why Kathy didn't like Mrs. Jewls.|$|E
