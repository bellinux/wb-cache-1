50|$|Normally {{cell culture}} {{experiments}} are {{performed in a}} CO2 incubator. Also perfusion culture experiments can be performed in such an atmosphere. However, a much better solution is the performance of perfusion culture experiments under atmospheric air on a laboratory table, since it facilitates the complete handling. However, {{in this case the}} culture medium has to be adjusted to atmospheric air.Keeping media in a 5% CO2 atmosphere within an incubator always a relatively high amount of NaHCO3 is contained to maintain a constant pH between 7.2 and 7.4. If such a formulated medium is used for perfusion culture outside a CO2 incubator, the pH will shift from the physiological range to much more alkaline values due to the low <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>CO2</b> (0.3%) in atmospheric air.For that reason any medium used for perfusion culture outside a CO2 incubator has to be stabilized by reducing the NaHCO3 concentration and/or by adding biological buffers such as HEPES (GIBCO/Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) or BUFFER ALL (Sigma-Aldrich-Chemie, München, Germany). The necessary amount can be easily determined by admixing increasing amounts of biological buffer solution to an aliquot of medium. Then the medium must equilibrate over night on a thermo plate at 37 °C under atmospheric air. For example, application of 50 mmol/l HEPES or an equivalent of BUFFER ALL (ca. 1%) to IMDM (Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium, GIBCO/Invitrogen) will maintain a constant pH of 7.4 throughout long term perfusion culture under atmospheric air on a laboratory table.|$|E

The present study aimed to establish the efficacy <b>of</b> using <b>CO₂</b> in big bags and containers to prevent pests’ development. Four trials were conducted with gastight big bags (900 x 900 x 1000 or 1600 cm). Two of these trials were conducted with polished rice and samples of Sitophilus oryzae, one trial with chamomile infested with Lasioderma serricorne and one trial with cocoa and samples of Tribolium confusum and Ephestia kuehniella. Initial <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>CO₂</b> were higher than 75 %, which decreased depending on exposure time (13 to 90 d) and food product. In all four trials the insects present in the infested samples were controlled with the MA. An additional trial was conducted in a 9 m container containing dried herbs in boxes, big bags and other packaging formats. Twelve infested samples of L. serricorne and Plodia interpunctella were distributed uniformly {{at the bottom and}} top of the container. A concentration between 70 % and 15 % CO₂ was maintained for an exposure time of 18 d. In spite of the decrease in CO₂ content, the treatment was also effective to control all insects present in the samples.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of oxidation of C₂ hydrocarbons to carbon oxide formation during the oxidative coupling of methane over a Li/MgO catalyst has been investigated. Small quantities of ¹³C₂H₆ and ¹³C₂H₄ {{were added to}} CH₄/O₂ in a recycle reactor and the ¹²C and ¹³C <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> C₂H₆, C₂H₄, CO, and CO₂ were determined by mass spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. At temperatures greater than 740 °C, C₂ oxidation {{was responsible for the}} formation of 30 - 80 % of the carbon oxides. However at lower temperatures (< 700 °C) C₂ oxidation accounted for less than 10 % of the carbon oxides. Possible mechanisms for C₂ oxidation are competition with CH₄ for O₂ in a surface-promoted reaction and/or a purely homogeneous process involving competitive reactions of the methyl radical. Calculations based on known rate constants and experimental observations of increased C₃H₆ formation when ¹³C₂H₄ is added to the CH₄/O₂ mixture show that the abstraction and combination reactions, CH₃ + C₂H₆ → CH₄ + C₂H₅ (6), CH₃ + C₂H₄ → CH₄ + C₂H₃ (7), and CH₃ + C₂H₄ → C₃H₇ → C₃H₆ + H (8), compete effectively with the methyl coupling reaction. The ¹³C <b>content</b> <b>of</b> C₂H₆ and C₂H₄ confirms that secondary reactions of C₂H₆ are responsible for C₂H₄ formation. Results for the ¹³C <b>content</b> <b>of</b> CO and <b>CO₂</b> are consistent with CO oxidation being the source <b>of</b> <b>CO₂</b> but are not precise enough for this conclusion to be definitive. The experiments also show that there is an exchangeable pool <b>of</b> <b>CO₂</b> on the catalyst, and the formation of Li₂CO₃ under reaction conditions is probably responsible. 6 page(s...|$|R
