Friskies was initially introduced by Carnation Company in the 1930s as a dog food brand. When Friskies cat food {{was introduced in the}} 1950s, it was the first dry pet food product specifically for cats. The brand was acquired by Nestlé in 1985. From the 1970s to the 2000s, variations in Friskies cat food proliferated as the competition for <b>consumer</b> <b>spending</b> intensified.|$|E

About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe. The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers. The United States is ranked among the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than European nations tend to.|$|E

The Ehrlich-Fisher model starts from consumer cost, translates the cost <b>consumers</b> <b>spend</b> on getting commodities into the services retail formats provide and expresses the price and service combination in a formal theoretical model. Another noteworthy study is Betancourt (2006). He uses a specific function, in which the services that retail formats provide are an inverse function of consumer cost considering different consumer preferences, to build a mapping relationship between consumer preferences in a consumption environment and a service input stream from retailing providers.|$|R

5|$|Obsessed {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics, {{many of whom}} were disappointed {{in the absence of an}} explanation for Lisa's obsession with Derek. Others noted that the potential theme of interracial conflict between the Charles family, who are black, and Lisa, who is white, was unexplored. The storyline of Obsessed has been compared with that of Fatal Attraction (1987) - a recollection in which Elba and Beyoncé have the Michael Douglas and Anne Archer roles, respectively, while Larter is in Glenn Close's - although film critics disliked the fact that Derek did not yield to Lisa's seduction. The fight scene finale between Sharon and Lisa, however, was commended by reviewers, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Fight. Obsessed spent its first week atop the US box office, and grossed $73.8million from theaters, internationally. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film for home viewing on August4,2009, in the US and has sold 1.3million DVDs, worth $21million of <b>consumer</b> <b>spending.</b>|$|E

25|$|Brown’s {{reaction}} to the great 2008 banking crisis was much more pro active than France or Germany, {{and in many ways}} resembled the Bush policies in Washington. Brown's goals were to provide more liquidity to the financial system, to recapitalise the banks and to guarantee bank debt. He lowered the VAT to encourage <b>consumer</b> <b>spending</b> and to keep the economy from sinking.|$|E
25|$|The second {{criticism}} is that savings represent loanable funds, particularly at banks, assuming the savings are held at banks, rather than currency itself being held ("stashed under one's mattress"). Thus {{an accumulation of}} savings yields an increase in potential lending, which will lower interest rates and stimulate borrowing. So a decline in <b>consumer</b> <b>spending</b> is offset {{by an increase in}} lending, and subsequent investment and spending.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{commonly}} discussed effect of paper wealth is the wealth effect: as people (households) increase in wealth, {{they are likely}} to spend more, while if their wealth decreases, {{they are likely to}} spend less. This is termed [...] "the wealth effect" [...] (compare income effect), and is generally attributed to psychological feelings of confidence - one feels rich, so one spends. The significance of the wealth effect is debated; it is generally procyclical, meaning that when the economy is doing well, asset prices increase, causing <b>consumers</b> to <b>spend</b> more, which provides further stimulus to the economy and risks causing overheating. Conversely, if the economy is doing poorly, asset prices fall and <b>consumers</b> <b>spend</b> less, leading to a vicious cycle and potentially a depression.|$|R
25|$|Devolving {{power to}} consumers. Some proponents have {{suggested}} that ethical food markets – and the PGS framework directly – has furthered a 'cash till' form of political democracy, whereby <b>consumer</b> <b>spending</b> power can masquerade as a legitimate governance structure and mechanism (i.e. democratically voted, representative, and therefore accountable). This {{is part of a}} broader shift from forms of 'government' to 'governance' seen in a neoliberalizing world, where a raft of non-state actors, arguably, make informed decisions about where and what to purchase.|$|E
25|$|By mid-1930, {{interest}} rates {{had dropped to}} low levels, but expected deflation and the continuing reluctance of people to borrow meant that <b>consumer</b> <b>spending</b> and investment were depressed. By May 1930, automobile sales had declined to below the levels of 1928. Prices in general began to decline, although wages held steady in 1930. Then a deflationary spiral started in 1931. Conditions were worse in farming areas, where commodity prices plunged and in mining and logging areas, where unemployment was high and there were few other jobs.|$|E

While his strategy was successful in reducing inflation, growth averaged only 2.8 percent a year. By fixing the exchange rate, the peso became rapidly overvalued while <b>consumer</b> <b>spending</b> increased, causing the current account deficit to reach 7% of GDP in 1994. The deficit was financed through tesobonos a type of public debt instrument that reassured payment in dollars.|$|E
