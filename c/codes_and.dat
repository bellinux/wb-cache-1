5|$|Gleason is {{also the}} namesake of the Gleason polynomials, a system of polynomials that {{generate}} the weight enumerators of linear codes. These polynomials take a particularly simple form for self-dual codes: in this case there are just two of them, the two bivariate polynomials x2+y2 and x8+14x2y2+y8. Gleason's student Jessie MacWilliams continued Gleason's work in this area, proving {{a relationship between the}} weight enumerators of <b>codes</b> <b>and</b> their duals that has become known as the MacWilliams identity.|$|E
5|$|Imamura was {{up against}} a resourceful, {{resolute}} and aggressive opponent, who also had access to good intelligence.

Blamey chose not to wait for this to become clear, but immediately ordered the 17th Infantry Brigade to move from Milne Bay to Wau on 4 January 1943. Its commander—Brigadier Murray Moten—was ordered to assume command of Kanga Force and defend Wau.|$|E

5|$|In 941 Oda {{was named}} Archbishop of Canterbury.

The archbishop was present, along with Archbishop Wulfstan of York, at council that proclaimed the first of these law <b>codes</b> <b>and</b> which was held by Edmund at London, over Easter around 945 or 946.

5|$|In Hundreds, players touch circles to {{make them}} grow without overlapping. There are 100 puzzles that {{increase}} in complexity. The Flash version was much simpler in design, and added circles onscreen as the game progressed. The iOS version added a new gameplay mode and a narrative element based on ciphers and <b>codes,</b> <b>and</b> was released on January 7, 2013 for iPhone and iPad, and later for Android. It was nominated for several Independent Games Festival awards, and The Atlantic critic Ian Bogost wrote that the game functioned like a design object, a feat unique for the video game medium.|$|E
5|$|In the English towns the {{burgage tenure}} for urban {{properties}} was established {{early on in}} the medieval period, and was based primarily on tenants paying cash rents rather than providing labour services. Further development of a set of taxes that could be raised by the towns included murage for walls, pavage for streets, and pontage, a temporary tax for the repair of bridges. Combined with the lex mercatoria, which was a set of <b>codes</b> <b>and</b> customary practices governing trading, these provided a reasonable basis for the economic governance of the towns.|$|E
40|$|We compare {{multicast}} network <b>coding</b> <b>and</b> routing for a time-varying {{wireless network}} model with interference- determined link capacities. We use dynamic back pressure algorithms that are optimal for intra-session network <b>coding</b> <b>and</b> routing respectively. Our {{results suggest that}} under such conditions, the gap in multicast capacity between network <b>coding</b> <b>and</b> routing can decrease relative to a collision-based wireless model with fixed link capacities...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} feasibility of applying the <b>code</b> <b>and</b> the ionosphere-free <b>code</b> <b>and</b> phase delay observables for single frequency Precise Point Positioning (PPP) processing. Two observation models were studied: the single frequency ionosphere-free <b>code</b> <b>and</b> phase delay, termed the quasi-phase observable, <b>and</b> the <b>code</b> <b>and</b> quasi-phase combination. When implementing the <b>code</b> <b>and</b> quasi-phase combination, the cross-correlation between the observables must be considered. However, {{the development of an}} appropriate weight matrix, which can adequately describe the noise characteristics of the single frequency <b>code</b> <b>and</b> quasi-phase observations, is not a trivial task. The noise in the code measurements is highly dependent on the effects of the ionosphere; while the quasi-phase measurements are basically free from the effects of the ionospheric error. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate whether the correlation between the two measurements can be neglected when the code measurements were re-introduced to constrain the initial parameters estimation and thereby improving the phase ambiguities initialization process. It is revealed that the assumed uncorrelated <b>code</b> <b>and</b> quasi-phase combination provided comparable if not better positioning precision than the quasi-phase measurement alone. The level of improvement in the estimated positions is between 1 - 18 cm RMS...|$|R

5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted {{after the}} Civil War to {{restrict}} {{the free exercise of}} those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black <b>Codes.</b> <b>And</b> when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, Riven is a {{point and}} click {{adventure}} game played from a first-person perspective. The player explores immersive environments depicted through a large series of computer generated stills using mouse clicks for movement or to manipulate objects within reach. By operating mechanical contraptions and deciphering <b>codes</b> <b>and</b> symbols discovered in the surroundings, the vaguely explained goal can eventually be reached.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in the mid-Atlantic and their withdrawal, meant the Bay of Biscay became {{congested}} with German submarines seeking refuge. Thus, AOC Slessor revisited the interdiction strategy which had been tried, and failed in 1941 and 1943. This time, there were crucial differences. Firstly, the improvement of radar had enhanced detection of submarines, submerged and surfaced, and intelligence breakthroughs, in which the British Ultra organisation had broken the naval Enigma <b>codes</b> <b>and</b> confirmed {{a major change in}} German strategy, enabled the British to focus on the Biscay.|$|E

5|$|The {{exploratory}} {{parts of}} the game feature a series of arcane <b>codes</b> <b>and</b> glyphs, treasure maps and chests, and secret rooms. Players are left without guidance to determine whether game elements are decipherable subpuzzles or simply false signals. These sorts of puzzles include hidden warp gates, enigmatic obelisks, invisible platforms, sequences of tetrominos, a ciphered alphabet, and QR codes. One of the game's recurring themes is an ancient civilization that attempted {{to make sense of}} their dimensionality, as told through artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Wulfhelm (died 12 February 941) was Bishop of Wells {{before being}} {{promoted}} to the Archbishopric of Canterbury about 926.

5|$|A {{separate}} {{criminal investigation}} {{focused on the}} illegal factory itself. Almost all factories and homes in the area were illegal and unauthorised, and do not follow building <b>codes</b> <b>and</b> sanctions. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said action would be taken against {{the owners of the}} factory and house, and Superintendent of Police of South 24 Parganas S. N. Gupta said that the owners of the building would be arrested. Investigation has shown that the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) issued notices to the building on three separate occasions, in 1988, 1989, and 1992, yet took no further action. It has been shown, however, that the KMC also approved trade licences for two businesses to operate from the building. The owner of the building, Khurshid Alam, has had a police complaint filed against him by the fire department for illegal construction charges. Mohammed Sagir Ahmed and Mohammed Asif, the owners of Tenex Exports, also face related charges. Both investigations are ongoing.|$|E
