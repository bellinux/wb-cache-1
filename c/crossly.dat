In January 1645 committee members Robert Clive, Andrew Lloyd, Thomas Hunt and Robert Charlton wrote to William Brereton to solicit help for their plan to retake Shrewsbury. They said that Mytton [...] "carries himself <b>crossly</b> towards us on all matters," [...] and proposed not to inform him of the plan, but to pretend they were making an attempt on the nearby village of Atcham - a plausible target, as it commanded important bridges where Watling Street crossed the River Severn and River Tern. In the event, Mytton {{was in charge of}} one of the cavalry units that occupied the town on 21 February. However, the crucial first entry to the town was made by a tiny shock force under William Reinking, a Dutch professional soldier employed by the Wem committee, which was admitted into the town by a sympathiser.

6000|$|... 'Please hush! Never mind!' said Sophy, almost <b>crossly,</b> {{and getting}} {{up from the}} floor quickly, as though {{resolved}} to be well.|$|E
60|$|But Mrs. Hill <b>crossly</b> {{told him}} he didn't know {{anything}} about it, so, being a wise man, he held his tongue.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Leave me in peace, and don't trouble me {{with your}} nonsense,' said the {{merchant}} quite <b>crossly.</b> 'How my {{money has been}} wasted!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Chug-a-rum! It's {{none of my}} business. Maybe he {{swallows}} it," [...] replied Grandfather Frog <b>crossly,</b> {{and turned}} his back on Peter Rabbit.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Does she say so? Well, if {{you believe}} that, you may drink cold water and think it bacon,' the unhappy Tubby {{answered}} <b>crossly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Say, what's it all about, anyway?' demanded Ogden <b>crossly.</b> 'Can't {{a fellow}} {{have a bit}} of grub in peace? You give me a pain.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Pero, hombre,' {{said the}} doctor <b>crossly.</b> 'Why didn't {{you tell me that}} before? Now I shall have to write another certificate. This one's no good.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go 'way wid yer line," [...] said Aunt Judy, <b>crossly.</b> [...] "Ise abed. Come in der mornin'. Time {{enough in}} de day-time to work lines." ...|$|E
60|$|With sundry growls the men complied, and, {{thrusting}} {{their legs}} {{out of their}} bunks, rolled on to the locker, and sat <b>crossly</b> waiting for information.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{grown up}} now," [...] I said <b>crossly.</b> [...] "Why, I'm {{eighteen}} {{and a half}} and I'm two inches taller {{than any of the other}} girls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, be quiet, father. You're wound up, by {{the sound}} of you,' she said to him, as if <b>crossly.</b> But she could never be cross with him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, well,' cried her husband, <b>crossly,</b> 'don't {{strangle}} me for that! He never {{struck me}} as such a marvellous treasure. There {{is no need to}} be frantic!' ...|$|E
60|$|He resented being wakened. It amused her. She saw {{his neck}} in the flannel sleeping-jacket, as white and round as a girl's. He rubbed his hair <b>crossly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hear you}} have been teasing Elsa again," [...] she said <b>crossly.</b> [...] "Why can't you let her enjoy herself just for to-night, without interfering with her?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Only {{once did}} he speak <b>crossly</b> to the monkey, {{and that was}} when he put him into the cage preparatory to commencing his morning's work. Then he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish," [...] he {{blurted out}} {{somewhat}} <b>crossly</b> at last, [...] "you'd {{help me out}} a bit, Tom. Hang it all, man, all this officialism makes me dumb." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I am not doubting your love, Algernon,' she replied, 'but it is {{impossible}} for me to avoid seeing that the matter is a great annoyance to you, and that it is troubling you very much. You have several times spoken quite <b>crossly</b> to me, and I am not in the habit of being spoken <b>crossly</b> to.

6000|$|She stepped {{behind me}} and whispered <b>crossly,</b> 'Take {{yourself}} and your dusters off; when company are in the house, servants don't commence scouring and cleaning {{in the room where}} they are!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Paul Blackthorn! {{how should}} I know?' said Mrs. Shepherd <b>crossly.</b> 'I'm {{not to be}} looking after thieves and vagabonds. He's a come-by-chance, and he's a go-by-chance, and a good riddance too!' ...|$|E
60|$|Old Pretty by {{this time}} had looked round, puzzled; and seeing two people {{crouching}} under her where, by immemorial custom, {{there should have been}} only one, lifted her hind leg <b>crossly.</b>|$|E
