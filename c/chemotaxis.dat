5|$|Motile {{bacteria}} are attracted or repelled by certain stimuli in behaviours called taxes: these include <b>chemotaxis,</b> phototaxis, energy taxis, and magnetotaxis. In one peculiar group, the myxobacteria, individual bacteria move {{together to form}} waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores. The myxobacteria move only when on solid surfaces, unlike E. coli, which is motile in liquid or solid media.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} {{inflammation}} in DPB persists {{with or without}} the presence of P.aeruginosa and H.influenzae provides a means to determine several mechanisms of DPB pathogenesis. Leukotrienes are eicosanoids, signaling molecules made from essential fatty acids, which play a role in many lung diseases by causing the proliferation of inflammatory cells and excess mucus production in the airways. In DPB and other lung diseases, the predominant mediator of neutrophil-related inflammation is leukotriene B4, which specializes in neutrophil proliferation via <b>chemotaxis</b> (the movement of some types of cells toward or away from certain molecules).|$|E
5|$|When {{neutrophils}} {{release their}} granule contents in the kidney, {{the contents of}} the granule (reactive oxygen compounds and proteases) degrade the extracellular matrix of host cells and can cause damage to glomerular cells, affecting their ability to filter blood and causing changes in shape. In addition, phospholipase products (e.g., leukotrienes) intensify the damage. This release of substances promotes <b>chemotaxis</b> of more neutrophils to the site of infection, and glomerular cells can be damaged further by the adhesion molecules during the migration of neutrophils. The injury done to the glomerular cells can cause renal failure.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes {{that travel}} {{throughout}} the body in pursuit of invading pathogens. Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly {{as a result of}} bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called <b>chemotaxis,</b> and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and: (i) produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and cytokines, while they can also (ii) act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.|$|E

25|$|<b>Chemotaxis</b> assays are {{experimental}} {{tools for}} evaluation of chemotactic ability of prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells.|$|E
25|$|Also, lately, {{microfluidic}} {{devices have}} been more and more frequently used to test quantitatively, and precisely, for <b>chemotaxis.</b>|$|E
25|$|During <b>chemotaxis,</b> cell {{movement}} is {{facilitated by the}} binding of Î²1 integrins to components of the extracellular matrix: VLA-3, VLA-4 and VLA-5 to fibronectin and VLA-2 and VLA-3 to collagen and other extracellular matrix components.|$|E
25|$|The steroid {{progesterone}} {{has been}} found to modulate the activity of CatSper (cation channels of sperm) voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Since eggs release progesterone, sperm may use progesterone as a homing signal to swim toward eggs (<b>chemotaxis).</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{biological}} systems, modified {{versions of}} the lattice gas model {{have been used to}} understand a range of binding behaviors. These include the binding of ligands to receptors in the cell surface, the binding of <b>chemotaxis</b> proteins to the flagellar motor, and the condensation of DNA.|$|E
25|$|Spermatozoa are {{produced}} in the seminiferous tubules of the testes in a process called spermatogenesis. Round cells called spermatogonia divide and differentiate eventually to become spermatozoa. During copulation the cloaca or vagina gets inseminated, and then the spermatozoa move through <b>chemotaxis</b> to the ovum inside a Fallopian tube or the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Response to stimuli: a {{response}} {{can take many}} forms, from the contraction of a unicellular organism to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of multicellular organisms. A response is often expressed by motion; for example, the leaves of a plant turning toward the sun (phototropism), and <b>chemotaxis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Chemotaxis</b> {{is defined}} as a passage of an {{organism}} toward or away from a chemical stimulus along a chemical concentration gradient. Certain organisms demonstrate <b>chemotaxis</b> when they move toward a supply of nutrients. In D. discoideum, the amoeba secretes the signal, cAMP, out of the cell, attracting other amoebae to migrate toward the source. Every amoeba moves toward a central amoeba, the one dispensing the greatest amount of cAMP secretions. The secretion of the cAMP is then exhibited by all amoebae and is a call for them to begin aggregation. These chemical emissions and amoeba movement occur every six minutes. The amoebae move toward the concentration gradient for 60 seconds and stop until the next secretion is sent out. This behavior of individual cells tends to cause oscillations in a group of cells, and chemical waves of varying cAMP concentration propagate through the group in spirals.|$|E
25|$|About 60% of all ALF {{patients}} fulfil {{the criteria}} for systemic inflammatory syndrome irrespective of {{presence or absence of}} infection. This often contributes towards multi organ failure. Impaired host defence mechanism, due to impaired opsonization, <b>chemotaxis</b> and intracellular killing, substantially increases risk of sepsis. Bacterial sepsis mostly due to gram positive organisms and fungal sepsis are observed in up to 80% and 30% patients, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The use of cAMP as a {{chemotactic}} {{agent is}} not established {{in any other}} organism. In developmental biology, {{this is one of}} the comprehensible examples of <b>chemotaxis,</b> which is important for an understanding of human inflammation, arthritis, asthma, lymphocyte trafficking, and axon guidance. Phagocytosis is used in immune surveillance and antigen presentation, while cell-type determination, cell sorting, and pattern formation are basic features of embryogenesis that may be studied with these organisms.|$|E
25|$|IL-17 {{promotes}} psoriasis by {{contributing to}} the inflammatory response that damages and overturns the keratinocyte cells of the epidermal layer. Inflammation begins with keratinocyte cells entering {{the final stages of}} their cell cycle, which activates immature dendritic cells (DC). Cytokines released from DCs stimulate dying keratinocytes to secrete TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 leading to the <b>chemotaxis</b> of T cells, natural killer cells and monocytes to the epidermis. These cells release IL-23 which induce Th17 cells to produce IL-17.|$|E
25|$|Several {{medications}} {{may be used}} {{to block}} the action of allergic mediators, or to prevent activation of cells and degranulation processes. These include antihistamines, glucocorticoids, epinephrine (adrenaline), mast cell stabilizers, and antileukotriene agents are common treatments of allergic diseases. Anti-cholinergics, decongestants, and other compounds thought to impair eosinophil <b>chemotaxis,</b> are also commonly used. Though rare, the severity of anaphylaxis often requires epinephrine injection, and where medical care is unavailable, a device known as an epinephrine autoinjector may be used.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatories, {{regardless}} of the inflammation's cause; their primary anti-inflammatory mechanism is lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis. Lipocortin-1 both suppresses phospholipase A2, thereby blocking eicosanoid production, and inhibits various leukocyte inflammatory events (epithelial adhesion, emigration, <b>chemotaxis,</b> phagocytosis, respiratory burst, etc.). In other words, glucocorticoids not only suppress immune response, but also inhibit the two main products of inflammation, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. They inhibit prostaglandin synthesis {{at the level of}} phospholipase A2 {{as well as at the}} level of cyclooxygenase/PGE isomerase (COX-1 and COX-2), the latter effect being much like that of NSAIDs, potentiating the anti-inflammatory effect.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{characterized}} two novel peptides in the venom {{of the social}} wasp: Protonectin and Agelaia-MP. The first venom, Protonectin, {{is found to be}} the same venom from relative neotropical social wasp, Protonectarina sylveirae. In cohesion, the two peptide toxins were tested for and displayed potent ability to negatively effect hemolytic activity, mass cell granulation, and <b>chemotaxis</b> in large vertebrates. The inhibition of these activities can result in anaphylactic shock, renal failure and myonecrosis in humans. Certainly, the characterization and identification of these novel A. pallipes toxins will allow scientists to elucidate the mechanism of envenoming which will lead to future pharmacological breakthroughs.|$|E
25|$|Because {{many of its}} {{genes are}} {{homologous}} to human genes, yet its lifecycle is simple, D. discoideum is commonly used as a model organism. It can be observed at organismic, cellular, and molecular levels primarily because of their restricted number of cell types and behaviors, and their rapid growth. It is used to study cell differentiation, <b>chemotaxis,</b> and programmed cell death, which are all normal cellular processes. It {{is also used to}} study other aspects of development, including cell sorting, pattern formation, phagocytosis, motility, and signal transduction. These processes and aspects of development are either absent or too difficult to view in other model organisms. D. discoideum is closely related to higher metazoans. It carries similar genes and pathways, making it a good candidate for gene knockout.|$|E
25|$|IL-17 {{interaction}} with IL-17RA receptors, abundant on the keratinocyte cell surface, incite epidermal cells to increase expression of IL-6, antimicrobial peptides, IL-8 and CCL20. Increased concentration of IL-6 alters the epidermal environment by decreasing {{the ability of}} T regulatory cells to control the behavior of Th17 cells. Reduced regulation allows uninhibited proliferation of Th17 cells and production of IL-17 in psoriatic lesions, augmenting IL-17 signaling. Antimicrobial peptides and IL-8 attract neutrophils {{to the site of}} injury where these cells remove damaged and inflamed keratinocyte cells. New immature DCs are also recruited by CCL20 via <b>chemotaxis</b> where their activation restarts and amplifies the cycle of inflammation. IL-17 and additional cytokines released from the influx of neutrophils, T and dendritic cells mediate effects on localized leukocytes and keratinocytes that supports the progression of psoriasis by inciting chronic inflammation.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to using <b>chemotaxis</b> to avoid areas of low pH, H. pylori also neutralizes the acid in its environment by producing {{large amounts of}} urease, which breaks down the urea present in the stomach to carbon dioxide and ammonia. [...] These react with the strong acids in the environment to produce a neutralized area around H. pylori. Urease [...] knockout mutants are incapable of colonization. In fact, urease expression is not only required for establishing initial colonization but also for maintaining chronic infection.|$|E
500|$|To {{avoid the}} acidic {{environment}} of {{the interior of the}} stomach (lumen), H. pylori uses its flagella to burrow into the mucus lining of the stomach to reach the epithelial cells underneath, where it is less acidic. [...] H. pylori is able to sense the pH gradient in the mucus and move towards the less acidic region (<b>chemotaxis).</b> [...] This also keeps the bacteria from being swept away into the lumen with the bacteria's mucus environment, which is constantly moving from its site of creation at the epithelium to its dissolution at the lumen interface.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} ways {{bacteria}} avoid contact with phagocytes. First, they can grow in sites that phagocytes are not capable of traveling to (e.g., the surface of unbroken skin). Second, bacteria can suppress the inflammatory response; without this response to infection phagocytes cannot respond adequately. Third, some species of bacteria can inhibit the ability of phagocytes {{to travel to the}} site of infection by interfering with <b>chemotaxis.</b> Fourth, some bacteria can avoid contact with phagocytes by tricking the immune system into [...] "thinking" [...] that the bacteria are [...] "self". Treponema pallidumâthe bacterium that causes syphilisâhides from phagocytes by coating its surface with fibronectin, which is [...] produced naturally by the body and plays a crucial role in wound healing.|$|E
500|$|To {{reach the}} site of infection, phagocytes leave the {{bloodstream}} and enter the affected tissues. Signals from the infection cause the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels to make a protein called selectin, which neutrophils stick to on passing by. Other signals called vasodilators loosen the junctions connecting endothelial cells, allowing the phagocytes {{to pass through the}} wall. <b>Chemotaxis</b> is the process by which phagocytes follow the cytokine [...] "scent" [...] to the infected spot. Neutrophils travel across epithelial cell-lined organs to sites of infection, and although this is an important component of fighting infection, the migration itself can result in disease-like symptoms. During an infection, millions of neutrophils are recruited from the blood, but they die after a few days.|$|E
500|$|During an infection, {{chemical}} signals attract phagocytes {{to places}} where the pathogen has invaded the body. These chemicals may come from bacteria or from other phagocytes already present. The phagocytes move by a method called <b>chemotaxis.</b> When phagocytes {{come into contact with}} bacteria, the receptors on the phagocyte's surface will bind to them. [...] This binding will lead to the engulfing of the bacteria by the phagocyte. Some phagocytes kill the ingested pathogen with oxidants and nitric oxide. After phagocytosis, macrophages and dendritic cells can also participate in antigen presentation, a process in which a phagocyte moves parts of the ingested material back to its surface. This material is then displayed to other cells of the immune system. Some phagocytes then travel to the body's lymph nodes and display the material to white blood cells called lymphocytes. This process is important in building immunity, and many pathogens have evolved methods to evade attacks by phagocytes.|$|E
2500|$|Approaching the {{egg cell}} {{is a rather}} complex, multistep process of <b>chemotaxis</b> guided by {{different}} chemical substances/stimuli on individual levels of phylogeny. One of the most significant, common signaling characters of the event is that a prototype of professional <b>chemotaxis</b> receptors, formyl peptide receptor (60,000 receptor/cell) {{as well as the}} activator ability of its ligand formyl Met-Leu-Phe have been demonstrated in the surface membrane even in the case of human sperms.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{proteins}} {{that have been}} used are glucokinase from a thermophile in Dâauria group and glucose-galactose-binding protein (...) , which is not an enzyme but a periplasmic protein involved in <b>chemotaxis</b> that undergoes a large conformational change.|$|E

These {{are weak}} and potent, respectively, stimulators of human eosinophil, neutrophil, and {{monocyte}} <b>chemotaxis</b> and thereby possible contributors to human allergic and non-allergic inflammation responses (see 5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid#Inflammation and 5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid#Allergy).|$|E

[...] D. discoideum is also a host for Legionella and is a suitable model for studying the infection process. [...] Specifically, D. discoideum shares with mammalian host cells a similar cytoskeleton and cellular processes relevant to Legionella infection, including phagocytosis, membrane trafficking, endocytosis, vesicle sorting, and <b>chemotaxis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Further {{evidence}} that arbuscular mycorrhizal [...] fungi exhibit host-specific <b>chemotaxis,</b> that enable hyphal growth toward {{the roots of}} a potential host plant: Spores of Glomus mosseae were separated from the roots of a host plant, nonhost plants, and dead host plant by a membrane permeable only to hyphae. In the treatment with the host plant, the fungi crossed the membrane and always emerged within 800Âµm of the root, {{but not in the}} treatments with nonhost plants and dead plants.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to tissue injury, neutrophils leave the circulatory system {{in great numbers}} and gather {{at the site of}} tissue injury. [...] They are drawn to the site by <b>chemotaxis,</b> following a concentration gradient of chemotactic molecules until they reach the site of greatest concentration: the site of injury and microbial presence. [...] Once there, the antimicrobial action of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, derived from the metabolic processes of the neutrophils, act to combat the microbial invasion. [...] While primarily mobilized to kill the invading microorganisms, the neutrophils actually cause a significant amount of host tissue damage as well. [...] Although the neutrophils themselves rarely remain alive {{for more than a few}} days, the excessive accumulation of dead neutrophils and the enzymes they released is a major cause of tissue breakdown in the acute phases of apical periodontitis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the sensors adopting environmentally sensitive dyes have utilized [...] , transport protein that binds to D-glucose and D-galactose and transports them to the membrane-bound Trg receptor triggering the <b>chemotaxis</b> of the bacterium towards that glucose source. It belongs to the malG family in Escherichia coli, which includes the maltose-binding protein, which, depending {{on the presence of}} glucose, can adopt two distinct conformations or possibly three generating a 31Â° hinge movement between the two globular domains connected by a hindge, which is the glucose-binding pocket. Its affinity for glucose is K= 0.2 ÂµM, which is much lower than the pathophysiological range of glucose found in diabetes (1.7-33 mM). As a consequence, several studies have been done to lower the affinity of [...] , which otherwise would result in near-saturation of [...] throughout the pathophysiological glucose concentrations. The binding affinity of [...] changes when it is labelled endosterically or peristerically, so several mutants that work at range close to pathophysiological glucose have been created.|$|E
