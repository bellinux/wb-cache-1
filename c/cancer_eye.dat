50|$|The Droughtmaster breed emerged. Other British breeds — mainly Hereford — {{have since}} been used in its {{development}} {{to arrive at a}} fixed tropical breed of approximately 50% Bos indicus and 50% Bos taurus genetics. Droughtmasters are medium to large with good walking and foraging abilities coupled with lower nutritional requirements to give them the ability to retain condition and keep breeding, irrespective of the prevailing conditions. Their short coat is generally red in colour, although variations from golden honey to dark red can occur. The red pigmentation in Droughtmasters helps protect the cattle from <b>cancer</b> <b>eye,</b> sunburnt udders and photosensitisation. The cattle may be polled or horned, but the vast majority are polled and exhibit only a moderate hump. They have medium to large ears and an extended dewlap.|$|E
50|$|Hair colour {{ranges from}} very light silver to {{chocolate}} or dark grey; a few animals are even black {{but the majority}} are silver to a silvery-dun color.

They have performed well in snow country and in a trial which was undertaken at a commercial feedlot between December 2002 and June 2003 {{to determine the effect}} of high heat load on performance and carcase characteristics when fed a high energy diet for 165-183 days.

40|$|This NebGuide {{will aid}} in the early {{identification}} and proper management of bovine ocular neoplasia, commonly known as <b>cancer</b> <b>eye,</b> including appropriate veterniary care. The common name for bovine ocular neoplasia, also known as ocular squamous cell tumors, is <b>cancer</b> <b>eye.</b> The term <b>cancer</b> <b>eye</b> is not entirely accurate and carries negative connotations. As {{we will explain in}} this NebGuide not all of these growths are cancerous. The scientific term for a cow is 2 ̆ 2 bovine, 2 ̆ 2 the medical term for the eye is 2 ̆ 2 ocular, 2 ̆ 2 and the medical term for these new and abnormal growths is 2 ̆ 2 neoplasia. 2 ̆ 2 Thus, the term bovine ocular neoplasia or BON is more accurate and less objectionable. Bovine ocular neoplasia (BON) includes a variety of benign and malignant skin tumors of the eyeball and eyelids. Benign tumors are growths that do not spread {{to other parts of the}} body and do not tend to grow into surrounding tissues. They can cause local problems with eye function, but do not affect the rest of the body. Malignant tumors are growths of cells that spread to other parts of the body and tend to invade surrounding tissues. Because cancerous tissue (tumor) is not acceptable for human consumption, any affected part of the animal 2 ̆ 7 s body will be condemned and an animal with evidence of a tumor that has spread to another part of the body is totally condemned...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of attaining adequate macronutrient and micronutrient intake throughout {{the life course}} {{is essential for the}} maintenance of health. Claims have been made for the benefits of micronutrient supplementation in later life, and this review considers the strength of the evidence behind these claims focusing on studies with cardiovascular, <b>cancer,</b> <b>eye</b> health, immune, and cognitive end points. While observational data suggest the presence of a link between dietary micronutrient intake and health outcomes, evidence from large randomized controlled trials does not support the use of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements among well-nourished older populations.

In conclusion, the considerable enthusiasm for the use of micronutrient, especially antioxidant, supplements as anti-aging treatments or as treatments for specific diseases of later life is not supported by the currently available scientific literature.

40|$|Background: Ultraviolet {{radiation}} exposure during an individuals' lifetime is a known {{risk factor for}} the development of skin cancer. However, less evidence is available on assessing the relationship between lifetime sun exposure and skin damage and skin aging. Objectives: This study aims to assess the relationship between lifetime sun exposure and skin damage and skin aging using a non-invasive measure of exposure. Methods: We recruited 180 participants (73 males, 107 females) aged 18 - 83 years. Digital imaging of skin hyper-pigmentation (skin damage) and skin wrinkling (skin aging) on the facial region was measured. Lifetime sun exposure (presented as hours) was calculated from the participants' age multiplied by the estimated annual time outdoors for each year of life. We analyzed the effects of lifetime sun exposure on skin damage and skin aging. We adjust for the influence of age, sex, occupation, history of skin <b>cancer,</b> <b>eye</b> color, hair color, and skin color. Results: There were non-linear relationships between lifetime sun exposure and skin damage and skin aging. Younger participant's skin is much more sensitive to sun exposure than those who were over 50 years of age. As such, there were negative interactions between lifetime sun exposure and age. Age had linear effects on skin damage and skin aging. Conclusion: The data presented showed that self reported lifetime sun exposure was positively associated with skin damage and skin aging, in particular, the younger people. Future health promotion for sun exposure needs to pay attention to this group for skin cancer prevention messaging. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Pigmentation {{patterns}} {{allow for}} the differentiation of cattle breeds. A dominantly inherited white head is characteristic for animals of the Fleckvieh (FV) breed. However, {{a minority of the}} FV animals exhibits peculiar pigmentation surrounding the eyes (ambilateral circumocular pigmentation, ACOP). In areas where animals are exposed to increased solar ultraviolet radiation, ACOP is associated with a reduced susceptibility to bovine ocular squamous cell carcinoma (BOSCC, eye <b>cancer).</b> <b>Eye</b> cancer is the most prevalent malignant tumour affecting cattle. Selection for animals with ACOP rapidly reduces the incidence of BOSCC. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying ACOP, we performed a genome-wide association study using 658, 385 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The study population consisted of 3579 bulls of the FV breed with a total of 320, 186 progeny with phenotypes for ACOP. The proportion of progeny with ACOP was used as a quantitative trait with high heritability (h 2  =  0. 79). A variance component based approach to account for population stratification uncovered twelve QTL regions on seven chromosomes. The identified QTL point to MCM 6, PAX 3, ERBB 3, KITLG, LEF 1, DKK 2, KIT, CRIM 1, ATRN, GSDMC, MITF and NBEAL 2 as underlying genes for eye area pigmentation in cattle. The twelve QTL regions explain 44. 96 % of the phenotypic variance of the proportion of daughters with ACOP. The chromosomes harbouring significantly associated SNPs account for 54. 13 % of the phenotypic variance, while another 19. 51 % of the phenotypic variance is attributable to chromosomes without identified QTL. Thus, the missing heritability amounts to 7 % only. Our results support a polygenic inheritance pattern of ACOP in cattle and provide the basis for efficient genomic selection of animals that are less susceptible to serious eye diseases...|$|E
