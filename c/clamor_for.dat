5|$|Soon {{after the}} end of the American Revolution in 1783, a surge of westward {{migration}} into Central and Western New York began. At the time, most travel west of the Albany area was by water. While rudimentary roads were laid out following the Mohawk River, there were no major land routes west of Fort Schuyler (present day Utica), except for an old east–west Iroquois trail that was a simple foot path. By the late 1780s many companies began to set up their operations in the new settlements in the Central and Western New York. As a result, there was a <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> the building of a main road running west from Utica.|$|E
5|$|The French {{reaction}} to this flurry of reforms was mixed, however. The very zeal of the program might betoken a renascent nationalism that could work against French interests. The debacle of the Battle of Trafalgar had {{made it clear that}} the projected invasion had to be scrapped. The Dutch now began to <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> economies in the form of the return of the Boulogne flotilla, which annoyed Napoleon, because he still had a use for it. The man who had led that flotilla to Boulogne Carel Hendrik Ver Huell, was now Secretary for the Navy. He had also become a confidant of the emperor, and now engaged in a secret correspondence with Talleyrand and Napoleon. The latter had just concluded the Peace of Pressburg and was busy dividing up Europe in client-kingdoms apportioned to his relatives. He saw a good candidate for such a position in the Netherlands in his brother Louis Bonaparte.|$|E

Aggie supporters began to <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> a stadium, but only $2,400 {{was raised by}} 1920. In 1927, the school chose {{to build a new}} concrete stadium, at a cost of $345,001.67 or $365,000, depending on the source.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the growing}} <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> non-Tagalog and non-English {{music and the}} greater {{representation}} of other Philippine languages, the local Philippine music industry, which is centered in Manila, is unforthcoming in venturing investments to other locations. Some of their major reasons include the language barrier, small market size, and socio-cultural emphasis away from regionalism in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|Smith's {{destruction}} of the Expositor exacerbated all these fears and non-Mormons throughout Illinois began to <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> his arrest. When Smith submitted to imprisonment in the county seat of Carthage, the Governor of Illinois, Thomas Ford, left the jail, taking the only impartial local militia unit with him. With the jail being guarded only by two guards and a unit of anti-Mormon militiamen, the Carthage Greys, a mob of disbanded militia units, attacked without resistance. Joseph and his brother Hyrum were killed.|$|E
25|$|From January 17 to 20, 2001, {{hundreds}} of thousands of Filipinos gathered at Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), the site of the original People Power Revolution. The <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> a change in the presidency gained momentum as various sectors of Philippine society – professionals, students, artists, politicians, leftist and rightist groups – joined what became known as EDSA II. Officials of the administration, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and the Philippine National Police (PNP) also withdrew their support for President Estrada.|$|E

25|$|The {{last quarter}} of 2000 {{up to the first}} week of January 2001 was a period of {{political}} and economic uncertainty for the Philippines. On January 16, 2001, the impeachment trial also took a new direction. Private prosecutors walked out of the trial when pro-Estrada senators prevented the opening of an evidence (a brown envelope) containing bank records allegedly owned by President Estrada. With the walkout, the impeachment trial was not completed and Filipinos eventually took to the streets in masses to continue the <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> President Estrada's resignation.|$|E
25|$|The craft-based AFL {{had been}} slow to {{organize}} industrial workers, and the federation remained steadfastly committed to craft unionism. This changed in the mid-1930s when, after passage of the National Labor Relations Act, workers began to <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> union membership. In competition with the CIO movement, the AFL established Federal Labor Unions (FLUs), which were local industrial unions affiliated directly with the AFL, a concept initially envisioned in the 1886 AFL Constitution. FLUs were conceived as temporary unions, {{many of which were}} organized on an industrial basis. In keeping with the craft concept, FLUs were designed primarily for organizing purposes, with the membership destined to be distributed among the AFL's craft unions after the majority of workers in an industry were organized.|$|E
25|$|James Madison won the U.S. presidential {{election}} of 1808, {{largely on the}} strength of his abilities in foreign affairs at a time when Britain and France were both on the brink of war with the United States. He was quick to repeal the Embargo Act, refreshing American seaports. Unfortunately, despite his intellectual brilliance, Madison lacked Jefferson's leadership and tried to merely copy his predecessor's policies verbatim. He tried various trade restrictions to try to force Britain and France to respect freedom of the seas, but they were unsuccessful. The British had undisputed mastery over the sea after defeating the French and Spanish fleet at Trafalgar in 1805, and they took advantage of this to seize American ships at will and force their sailors into serving the Royal Navy. Even worse, the size of the U.S. Navy was reduced due to ideological opposition to a large standing military and the Federal government became considerably weakened when the charter of the First National Bank expired and Congress declined to renew it. A <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> military action thus erupted just as relations with Britain and France were at a low point and the U.S.'s ability to wage war had been reduced.|$|E

[...] New Mombasa's urban environments fit the intended feel of the game, as Bungie felt that the change of protagonists required a change in location: [...] "We know the kinds of problems Master Chief solves," [...] Staten explained. [...] "He goes to ancient, alien ring artifacts, fights galaxy-consuming parasitic alien monsters and destroys alien empires [...] The ODST, they maybe take small parts in that larger struggle. But the kind of fights they usually get into are usually the kind of fights they can tackle in a day." ...|$|E
500|$|In 12 {{seasons of}} rugby, Stanford was remarkably successful: {{the team had}} three undefeated seasons, three one-loss seasons, and an overall record of 94 wins, 20 losses, and 3 ties for a winning {{percentage}} of [...]816. However, after a few years, the school began to feel the isolation of its newly adopted sport, which was not spreading as many had hoped. Students and alumni began to <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> a return to football to allow wider intercollegiate competition. The pressure at rival California was stronger (especially as the school had not been as successful in the Big Game as they had hoped), and in 1915 California returned to football. As reasons for the change, the school cited football rule changes, the overwhelming desire of students and supporters to play football, interest in playing other East Coast and Midwest schools, and a patriotic desire to play an [...] "American" [...] game.|$|E

500|$|While Steven (Zach Callison), Garnet (Estelle), Amethyst (Michaela Dietz) and Pearl (Deedee Magno) are {{watching}} a fictional Japanese movie titled Lonely Blade, Pearl critiques the film's sword fighting techniques and offers to give Steven a proper demonstration. At her arena, Pearl summons [...] "Holo-Pearl", a holographic version of herself to spar with. After Pearl wins a sparring match with Holo-Pearl, {{she begins to}} show Steven the basics of sword-fighting. However, Pearl's lessons bore Steven, making him <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> Pearl to teach him the signature move from the Lonely Blade movie, much to Pearl's chagrin. While Pearl is distracted talking to Steven, Holo-Pearl impales Pearl's chest with her sword, which causes Pearl to lose her physical form, leaving nothing but her gemstone. Although Steven is distraught at first, Garnet and Amethyst assure him that Pearl has simply retreated into her gem and will return, projecting a new body, once she has healed.|$|E
500|$|After the {{disastrous}} flood, the city {{wanted to find}} a way to control the reckless Trinity and to build a bridge linking Oak Cliff and Dallas. The city and citizens' immediate reaction was to <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> the construction of an indestructible, all-weather crossing over the Trinity. This had already been attempted following the 1890 floodthe result was the [...] "Long Wooden Bridge," [...] an unstable structure which had connected Jefferson Boulevard in Oak Cliff and Cadiz Street in Dallas until being washed away in the 1908 flood. [...] George B. Dealey, publisher of the Dallas Morning News, proposed a [...] concrete bridge similar to one crossing the Missouri River in Kansas City. [...] Soon, a US$650,000 bond program was approved in a city election, and the new Oak Cliff viaduct (now the Houston Street viaduct) was opened in 1912 among festivities that drew 58,000 spectators. [...] The bridge, at the time, was the longest concrete structure in the world.|$|E
500|$|For several months, {{the demand}} {{of the public}} for vengeance increased, so that Mallory feared that he would {{face the death penalty}} if convicted. However, no bill of {{particulars}} to specify precisely which of his acts constituted treason was ever presented, and it became increasingly clear {{that no one in the}} Confederate government was guilty of assassinating the former president. The period for extracting vengeance passed with no one put on trial, and hope was revived. From his prison cell, Mallory began to write letters in a personal campaign to gain release. He petitioned President Andrew Johnson directly, and enlisted the support of some of his former colleagues in the Senate. His wife Angela visited Washington and importuned President Johnson and other persons who had influence. Johnson was already quite lenient in granting pardons, and the popular <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> harsh punishment began to recede by the end of the year. On March 10, 1866, Johnson granted Mallory a [...] "partial parole." [...] Although he was no longer in jail, he was required to stay with his daughter in Bridgeport, Connecticut until he could take the oath of allegiance.|$|E

500|$|The {{problems}} {{of command and}} cohesion became more acute following the 1793 introduction of mass conscription, the so-called levée en masse. French commanders walked {{a fine line between}} the security of the frontier and the Parisian <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> victory. Add to this the desperate condition of the Armyin training, supplies, and leadershipand the military leadership faced a disaster. They themselves were constantly under suspicion from the representatives of the new regime and sometimes from their own soldiers. Failure to achieve unrealistic expectations implied disloyalty and the price of disloyalty was the guillotine: [...] the aged Nicolas Luckner, Jean Nicolas Houchard, Adam Philippe Custine, Arthur Dillon, and Antoine Nicolas Collier all fell under its blade. Francisco de Miranda's failure to take Maastricht landed him in La Force Prison for several years. [...] Many of the old officer class already had emigrated, forming émigré armies; the cavalry in particular suffered from their departure and two entire regiments, the Hussards du Saxe and the 15éme Cavalerie (Royal Allemande) defected en masse to the Austrians. The artillery arm, considered by the old nobility to be an inferior assignment, was less affected by emigration, and survived intact.|$|E
500|$|The film draws {{inspiration}} from the high demand for Christmas toys such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which often led to intense searching and occasional violence amongst shoppers. Randy Kornfield wrote the film's original screenplay after witnessing his in-laws go to a Santa Monica toy store at dawn {{in order to get}} his son a Power Ranger. While admitting to missing the <b>clamor</b> <b>for</b> the Cabbage Patch Kids and Power Rangers, producer Chris Columbus experienced a similar situation in 1995 when he attempted to obtain a Buzz Lightyear action figure from the film Toy Story, released that year. As a result, he rewrote Kornfield's script, which was accepted by 20th Century Fox. Columbus was always [...] "attracted to {{the dark side of the}} happiest holiday of the year", so wrote elements of the film as a satire of the commercialization of Christmas. Brian Levant was hired to direct the film. Columbus said Levant [...] "underst the humor in the material" [...] and [...] "was very animated and excited, and he had a vision of what he wanted to do". Levant said [...] "The story that was important to me was between the father and son...it's a story about love, and a father's journey to deliver it in the form of a Turbo Man doll. The fact that I got to design a toy line and do the commercials and make pajamas and comic books was fun for me as a filmmaker. But at its root, the movie's about something really sweet. It's about love and building a better family. I think that's consistent with everything I've done." ...|$|E
