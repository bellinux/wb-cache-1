5|$|Detailed {{floor plans}} of the tower were posted on the New York City's Department of Finance website in May 2011. This {{resulted}} in an uproar from the media and citizens of the surrounding area, who warned that the plans <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> used for a future terrorist attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} set to be {{released}} 10 days before Hurley would face Townsville Supreme Court, on 12 June. There were concerns that the case's jury <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> biased by the lyrical content.|$|E
5|$|In March 1951, {{along with}} {{half a dozen other}} newly badged Glosters, Large was sent to B Company's {{position}} in the low hills above the Imjin River. The Glosters, as part of the 29th Brigade, were defending routes through the valley that <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> used by the Chinese in a southbound offensive towards Seoul. On 22 April 1951, they engaged with Chinese troops in the Battle of Imjin.|$|E

5000|$|A {{character}} who resembles Atomic Skull appears in The Flash episode [...] "Invincible". He {{appears in the}} meta-human army created by Zoom. This version also semi looks like Firestorm, meaning it <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> just <b>be</b> another version of him.|$|R
5|$|The town of Atherton, {{which lies}} on the tracks, was an early and vocal {{opponent}} of electrification. Residents opposed electrification and the proposed high-speed rail route because the overhead electrical lines would require tree removal and the town <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> divided in two by permanently closing the two grade crossings at Fair Oaks Lane and Watkins Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Farke and {{his colleagues}} in 2014 {{published}} {{a description of a}} new neoceratopsian, Aquilops americanus, through the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE. They analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that Aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these groups would have a large ghost lineage with Aquilops.|$|E
5|$|For the German side, {{the battle}} left the 18th Army very {{stretched}} and exhausted. Lacking sufficient reinforcements, {{the command of}} Army Group North {{made the decision to}} shorten the front line by evacuating the Demyansk Pocket salient. The salient had been held throughout 1942, despite being encircled for a few months, as it was an important strategic bridgehead. Together with the Rzhev salient (which was also evacuated in spring 1943), it <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> used to encircle a large number of Soviet forces. However, in the situation that had developed, retaining it was no longer possible.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010 Iarnród Éireann {{planned to}} store {{some of its}} {{remaining}} push-pull capable Mark 3 coaches, which <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> have <b>been</b> used with 201 Class locomotives to enhance Enterprise's service. However, most Mark 3 carriages were scrapped during 2013 and 2014.|$|R
50|$|The {{mosquito}} vectors of W. bancrofti have {{a preference}} for human blood; humans are apparently the only animals naturally infected with W. bancrofti. There is no reservoir host, and the disease <b>could</b> therefore <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> eradicated.|$|R
50|$|The natural {{habitats}} of Aromobates nocturnus are small cold-water streams in cloud forests. The species {{is threatened by}} habitat loss caused by agriculture, involving both crops and livestock. It <b>could</b> also <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> affected by disease, such as chytridiomycosis.|$|R
5|$|The Aristarchus {{region was}} part of a Hubble Space Telescope study in 2005 that was {{investigating}} the presence of oxygen-rich glassy soils {{in the form of the}} mineral ilmenite. Baseline measurements were made of the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 landing sites, where the chemistry is known, and these were compared to Aristarchus. The Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys was used to photograph the crater in visual and ultraviolet light. The crater was determined to have especially rich concentrations of ilmenite, a titanium oxide mineral that <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> used in the future by a lunar settlement for extracting oxygen.|$|E
5|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} testing a specific integrin, alpha-six-beta-one, and the role it plays in the RMS. The study researched the principle that chemoattractive molecules may {{play an important role}} in neuroblast migration in the RMS. The study of this one particular integrin was conducted in mice. By using antibodies to bind to α6β1 integrin subunits, found on the neuroblasts, the researchers observed that the migration was disrupted. Furthermore, they investigated the mechanism through which α6β1 integrin functions and determined it was via the chemoattractant laminin. This was completed by injecting laminin perpendicular to the RMS and observing that doing so drew “neuroblasts away from their normal course of migration”. The researchers concluded with the idea that this research could prove useful for therapeutics purposes in that neuroblasts <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> drawn to locations of injury or disease.|$|E
5|$|Carrick {{is a small}} {{historic}} {{village that}} is primarily a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. Development has been slow and has not changed the town's original 19th century character. The local council's development plan aims to restrict development along Meander Valley road and prevent the merging of Carrick and Hadspen, keeping them as distinct centres. Construction is only planned within the town's boundary, where up to sixty homes <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> built under the strategic plan that runs until 2016. The town's development boundary is dictated by the span of sewerage connection. There are few businesses in the town and little incentive for business growth due to the town's small population. The town is in the Meander Valley Council local government area, the Federal Division of Lyons, and the State Division of Lyons.|$|E

5|$|The New Guinea {{crocodile}} {{was first}} {{described by the}} American herpetologist Karl Patterson Schmidt in 1928 as Crocodylus novaeguineae. At one time {{it was thought that}} there were two subspecies, C. n. novaeguineae, the New Guinea crocodile native to Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea, and C. n. mindorensis, the Philippine crocodile, native to several islands including Busuanga, Luzon, Masbate, Mindoro, Negros, Samar and Mindanao. Most authorities now consider that the Philippine crocodile is an entirely separate species. DNA sequencing data reported in 2011 showed that the Philippine crocodile is, in part, paraphyletic with regard to the New Guinea crocodile, and that the latter may constitutes a population within the Philippine crocodile. Among their two samples for the New Guinea crocodile, one was part of the Philippine crocodile clade and the other was separate, estimated to have diverged 2.6–6.8 million years ago. Both samples were taken from captives (<b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> misidentified or hybrids) and the result should therefore be treated with caution.|$|E
5|$|Various {{methods were}} used to build mottes. Where a natural hill could be used, scarping could produce a motte without the need to create an {{artificial}} mound, but more commonly much of the motte {{would have to be}} constructed by hand. Four methods existed for building a mound and a tower: the mound could either be built first, and a tower placed on top of it; the tower could alternatively be built on the original ground surface and then buried within the mound; the tower <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> built on the original ground surface and then partially buried within the mound, the buried part forming a cellar beneath; or the tower could be built first, and the mound added later.|$|E
5|$|By September 10, the {{prospect}} of securing a Baton Rouge location to host the Hornets was fading {{as a result of}} the facilities being utilized for hurricane related relief operations. Numerous cities inquired about hosting the franchise for the season, including Kansas City, Louisville, Nashville, Oklahoma City and San Diego. During this period, Oklahoma City announced that it was the favored choice to serve as the temporary home of the franchise, although by mid-September SMG announced that the New Orleans arena <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> ready for occupancy by the All-Star Game break. However, by late September the Hornets finalized a move to Oklahoma City, where 35 games would be played at the Ford Center, as well as six in Baton Rouge at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Additionally, it was announced that three of the games in March could be moved to New Orleans if the arena repairs were complete. At the same time, the NBA also announced the team would be referred to officially as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets, and that the deal reached with Oklahoma City would allow for the team to return for the 2006–07 season, if necessary.|$|E

50|$|The commission's {{final report}} was lengthy {{and based on}} {{extensive}} interviews and testimony. Its primary conclusion was that {{the failures of the}} U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) permitted the terrorist attacks to occur and that if these agencies acted more wisely and more aggressively, the attacks <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> have <b>been</b> prevented.|$|R
5|$|There is no {{well-established}} {{treatment for}} self-injurious behaviour in children or adolescents. Cognitive behavioural therapy {{may also be}} used to assist those with Axis I diagnoses, such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder, and <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self-harming behaviour. Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self-harm is thought {{by many to be the}} best approach to treating self-harm. But in some cases, particularly in people with a personality disorder, this is not very effective, so more clinicians are starting to take a DBT approach in order to reduce the behaviour itself. People who rely on habitual self-harm are sometimes hospitalised, based on their stability, their ability and especially their willingness to get help. In adolescents multisystem therapy shows promise. Treatments such as CBT, family intervention, interpersonal therapy, and various psychodynamic therapies were all shown to be possibly effective in treating self-injurious behaviour in children and adolescents.|$|E
