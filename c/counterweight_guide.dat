This {{report was}} {{produced}} at AZMONTS. A {{to develop the}} mechanical design of an elevator car frame and its components, in a more productive manner, so the company can decrease costs and improve its sales. The project stems from the need to bring to market an elevator lift with affordable production costs and with special conditions {{to comply with the}} provisions of the 7600 Law on Equal Opportunities and international regulations concerning the manufacture and installation of electric lifts per UNE EN 81 - 1 and ASME 17. 1. The lack of national production of elevator components requires the company AZMONT S. A. to import the elevator components from Spain. However, this report proves that the company’s production of elevator components in this country can benefit the company, making it more competitive in the elevator market in Costa Rica, as well as in {{other countries in the region}} where the company operates. The project variables are defined as: Cabin size, elevator speed, drive system and elevator path. During the practice, different types of elevator car frames were used and it was determined that the most appropriate model is the backpacks type. Three possible models were analyzed, but it was found one in particular met the minimum safety factors established by UNE EN 81 - 1 and ASME 17. 1. The model was based on appropriate and duly verified calculations. The project includes the selection of the suspension rope, gearless lift motor, car and <b>counterweight</b> <b>guide</b> rails and speed governor. The elevator car frame design proposal includes the cost benefit of developing its approach compared to products imported by the company AZMONT S. A. study. Once the project was finished the design of the elevator car frame plans were delivered to the Engineering Department of the company.

After the counterweight drops from a platform on the frame, gravity pulls the counterweight and pivots the beam.

The <b>counterweight</b> - <b>guide</b> rail and car guide rail systems particularly suffer from earthquake-induced vibrations. The most common mode of failure is counterweight derailment.

This paper reviews the dynamic phenomena and presents a model to study, to predict and to mitigate {{the effects of the}} seismic responses of guide rail – counterweight/ car – suspension systems. The application of a Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) is a convenient method to reduce the guide rail-counterweight/ car response and to control the system operating under seismic conditions. In the TMD arrangement vibrations of the counterweight/ car can be suppressed and the stresses in the guide rails reduced by the application of an auxiliary spring – damper - mass system attached to the main structure. In the counterweight system a part of the counterweight mass can be used as the auxiliary mass. The performance of the TMD can be improved by the application of an actuator force determined by a suitable feedback control algorithm...|$|R
