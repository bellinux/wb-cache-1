5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} Blaw-Knox tower was its wide diamond (or rhomboidal) shape, which served to make it rigid, to resist shear stresses. One advantage of this was {{to reduce the number}} of guy wires needed. Blaw-Knox masts required only one set of 3 or 4 <b>guy</b> <b>cables,</b> attached at the tower's wide [...] "waist". [...] In contrast, narrow masts require 2 to 4 sets of <b>guy</b> <b>cables,</b> attached at different heights, to prevent the tower from buckling. The advantage of fewer <b>guy</b> <b>cables</b> was to simplify the electrical design of the antenna, because conductive <b>guy</b> <b>cables</b> interfered with its radiation pattern. If not insulated at their bottom end, guy wires acted as additional [...] "antennas" [...] and conducted the power radiated by the antenna to ground, wasting power. Even when insulated from ground, the sections of <b>guy</b> <b>cable</b> could act as [...] "parasitic" [...] resonant elements, reradiating the radio waves in other directions and thus altering the antenna's radiation pattern. In some Blaw-Knox mast designs (see WBT towers, right) the upper pyramidal section was made longer than the lower, to keep the attachment point of the guys as low as possible, to minimize their interference.|$|R
40|$|Lateral {{oscillations}} {{of flexible}} elements (belts, <b>cables,</b> <b>guy</b> ropes, strings, etc.) in machines and devices under parametric excitation are studied. Mathematically {{the problem is}} presented as a partial differential equation describing parametric oscillations of flexible element with due account of its geometrical, static and physical nonlinearities. Two different methods of analysis have been used: mathematical simulation on analogue-digital computer system and numerical solution with computer programme MATLAB. It is shown that under some conditions resonant parametric oscillations of flexible element occur within wide continuous frequency zones. Besides, abrupt changes of amplitudes and modes of oscillations become possible within these zones. In such conditions system’s tuning away from dangerous resonant regimes remains problematic. The possible ways for practical application of these nonlinear effects are considered...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the structural sensitivity analysis of an offshore marginal field structure towards seismic loading, benchmarked against storm metocean conditions. The Tarpon monopod, {{also known as}} a <b>cable</b> <b>guyed</b> monotower is a type of marginal field structure used in minimizing cost of installation for small offshore field development. Related materials in the open literature on Tarpon platform are limited. This study intends to bridge such gaps. A single platform located in the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia is modelled in industrially recognized Finite Element software, SACS v 5. 3. A three-dimensional finite element model is created subjected to three sets of metocean criteria and a set of ground acceleration values suggested by notable seismic models for Malaysian basin. Throughout the analysis, the results suggest that the non-coupled wave or seismic ground acceleration is incapable of causing any structural failure. The overall platform design is found to be governed by the dominant wave forces as originating from the maximum metocean criteria. The stand-alone Peak Ground Acceleration of 0. 114 g does not induce a structural response that exceeds that of the worst metocean criteria. A coupled co-linear wave-earthquake loading analysis would be a definitive extension to this study. The results are anticipated to aid in better informed decision making for custodians of Tarpon Monopods in similar water depth as the model...|$|R
