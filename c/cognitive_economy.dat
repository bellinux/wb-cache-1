40|$|The present {{essay is}} part of a larger project with Dov Gabbay on the logic of {{practical}} reasoning. One of the principal foci of this work is the role of error in the <b>cognitive</b> <b>economies</b> of human reasoners. Logicians have been interested in error since the founding of their discipline. By and large, they have restricted their attention to three theoretical targets: the deductive error of invalidity, the non-demonstrative error of inductive weakness, and fallacies, characterized by Michael Scriven as “the attractive nuisances of argumentation ” ([Scriven, 1976, p. 333]). In recent writings or in work under way, Gabbay and I have questioned the assumption that invalidity and inductive strength are in fact errors just as they stand ([Gabbay and Woods, 2007 a]). 1 We have also advanced – with a tentativeness appropriate to its radicality – what we call the Negative Thesis. To see what the Negative Thesis proposes, it is necessary to take note of both the identity of the concept of fallacy which tradition has passed down to us, as well as the traditionally agreed members of its extension. The Negative Thesis asserts that the traditionally received list of the fallacies are not in fact in the extention of the traditionally received concept of fallacies ([Gabbay and Woods, 2007 a]) ...|$|R

50|$|This {{new model}} {{combines}} the motivational and cognitive processes of selective exposure. In the past, selective exposure had been studied from a motivational standpoint. For instance, the reason behind {{the existence of}} selective exposure was that people felt motivated to decrease the level of dissonance they felt while encountering inconsistent information. They also felt motivated to defend their decisions and positions, so they achieved this goal by exposing themselves to consistent information only. However, the new <b>cognitive</b> <b>economy</b> model not only {{takes into account the}} motivational aspects, but it also focuses on the cognitive processes of each individual. For instance, this model proposes that people cannot evaluate the quality of inconsistent information objectively and fairly because they tend to store more of the consistent information and use this as their reference point. Thus, inconsistent information is often observed with a more critical eye in comparison to consistent information. According to this model, the levels of selective exposure experienced during the decision-making process are also dependent on how much cognitive energy people are willing to invest. Just as people tend to be careful with their finances, cognitive energy or how much time they are willing to spend evaluating all the evidence for their decisions works the same way. People are hesitant to use this energy; they tend to be careful so they don't waste it. Thus, this model suggests that selective exposure does not happen in separate stages. Rather, it is a combined process of the individuals' certain acts of motivations and their management of the cognitive energy.|$|E

40|$|Theorizing about {{knowledge}} attributions has revolved {{almost exclusively}} around {{the problem of}} skepticism and knowledge attributions in everyday conversations. Sutton (2007), however, points out that Epistemic Contextualism seems to settle another field: 2 ̆ 2 [i]t is sometimes suggested that courtroom proceedings provide a context that shows the context-sensitivity of knowledge ascription truth-conditions 2 ̆ 2 (p. 87). This dissertation {{is devoted to the}} evaluation of this contextualist suggestion (CS). Epistemic Contextualism claims that the correctness of knowledge attributions depends on the salience of error possibilities or the practical states of a knowledge attributor 2 ̆ 7 s context of utterance. I interpret CS implies that the context of utterance is the context of litigation in which a knowledge attributor is at the moment of the attribution. A counter-example for CS is criminal cases in which the conviction of the defendant would meet the epistemic standards of all the knowledge attributors within and without the courtroom (e. g., police officers, the prosecutor, the judge, the jury). However, conviction is not guaranteed because it does not meet the invariant epistemic standards of proof fixed for conviction. My working hypothesis is that knowledge attributions have the purpose of stating that a cognitive agenda has been properly closed. Given that the object of knowledge attributions is cognitive agendas, the conditions under which knowledge is properly attributed depends {{on the nature of the}} cognitive agenda claimed to have been properly closed or advanced. This explains why, in the aforementioned cases, conviction cannot be secure, even if everyone within and without the court knows that the defendant is guilty. One of the closure conditions of conviction is the finding of the facts supporting conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. Knowledge is not properly attributed to the trier of facts, and conviction is not secured, until such requirement is satisfied. My working hypothesis is also confirmed studying the function of knowledge attributions in our <b>cognitive</b> <b>economies</b> instantiated by criminal investigations, in the attributions of testimonial knowledge as the most important source of legal knowledge, in the attributions of specialized knowledge by the trial judge, and in the attributions of group knowledge to juries and multi-agent courts...|$|R

40|$|How can an {{intelligent}} agent learn an effective representation of its world? This dissertation applies the psychological principle of <b>cognitive</b> <b>economy</b> {{to the problem}} of representation in reinforcement learning. Psychologists have shown that humans cope with difficult tasks by simplifying the task domain, focusing on relevant features and generalizing over states of the world which are “the same” with respect to the task. This dissertation defines a principled set of requirements for representations in reinforcement learning, by applying these principles of <b>cognitive</b> <b>economy</b> to the agent's need to choose the correct actions in its task. The dissertation formalizes the principle of <b>cognitive</b> <b>economy</b> into algorithmic criteria for feature extraction in reinforcement learning. To do this, it develops mathematical definitions of feature importance, sound decisions, state compatibility, and necessary distinctions, in terms of the rewards expected by the agent in the task. The analysis shows how the representation determines the apparent values of the agent's actions, and proves that the state compatibility criteria presented here result in representations which satisfy a criterion for task learnability. The dissertation reports on experiments that illustrate one implementation of these ideas in a system which constructs its representation as it goes about learning the task. Results with the puck-on-a-hill task and the pole-balancing task show that the ideas are sound and can be of practical benefit. The principal contributions of this dissertation are a new framework for thinking about feature extraction in terms of <b>cognitive</b> <b>economy,</b> and a demonstration of the effectiveness of an algorithm based on this new framework...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{applies the}} two notions of <b>cognitive</b> <b>economy</b> and mental {{world to the}} {{analysis}} of two rather different cases of miscommunication in translation. The paper argues for two tenets. First, the paper argues that <b>cognitive</b> <b>economy</b> is occasionally manifested as an unwarranted and only partly conscious decision to switch over, in the construction of translations, to what Berger (2007) calls the experiential mode of information processing. This is a way of processing information which is not analytical in nature but rather based on intuition generated by past experience and thus susceptible to overlooking some crucial source text information. This is information which is essential to the construction of adequate translations and which can be detected by the brain in its more methodically oriented rational mode only. Secondly, the paper also argues that the notion of mental world can be invoked to account for certain aspects of cultural infelicities in translations. A minor part of the material discussed in this paper was presented in a preliminary form at the 6 th DGKL conference Constructions & Cognition (Erlangen, Germany, Sept 30 [...] Oct 2, 2014) but the gist of the argumentation, especially the part related to the conclusions reached, is based on my later contribution to the Translation in Transition II conference (Germersheim, Germany, Jan 29 [...] 30, 2015) ...|$|E

Assailed by {{a multitude of}} stimuli {{they have to make}} sense of the inflow of information, fil-tering and processing what is necessary, but discarding that which is unimportant. This paper aims at investigating the interactions between evolution of the sensorial channel extracting the information from the environment and the simultaneous individual adaptation of agent-control. Our particular goal is to study the influence of learning on the evolution of sensors, with learning duration being the tuna-ble parameter. A genetic algorithm governs the evolution of sensors appropriate for the agent solving a simple grid world task. The performance of the agent is taken as fitness; ‘sensors ’ are conceived as a map from environmental states to agent observations, and individual adaptation is modeled by Q-learning. Our experimental results show that due to the principles of <b>cognitive</b> <b>economy</b> learning and varying the degree thereof actually transforms the fitness landscape. In particular we identify a trade-off between learning speed (load) and sensor accuracy (error). These results are further reinforced by theoretical analysis: we derive an analytical measure for the quality of sensors based on the mutual entropy between the system of states and the selection of an optimal action, a concept recently pro-posed by Polani, Martinetz, and Kim.

40|$|The {{transition}} {{towards a}} <b>cognitive</b> and post-industrial <b>economy</b> {{has led to}} the emergence of new strategies of capture of the immanent productive capacities of the social forces. Heritage entities are subject to, and also participate in, processes by which common creativity and knowledge are being harnessed by novel forms of rent and control. The objective of this paper was to show that conceiving heritage as a common situated in specific contexts rather than as a universal essence can open up novel epistemological spheres of communication between different knowledge practices. Also, it can help bridge some ontological gaps among the various stakeholders in the arena of heritage, such as academics, managers, architects, local communities and market forces. This entails considering heritage as an emergent material and immaterial construction process involving many different agents. Currently, these processes tend towards the privatization of common values and the shattering of local communities. Normally, this situation entails a fundamental alienation between objects and subjects, and the reification of heritage. This paper suggests that considering heritage as a common could provide a different perspective to tackle this crucial problem. Accordingly, scholars should not only be bound to a critical discursive stance, but should also commit to ‘ontological politics’ that would situate them as mediators between the global hierarchies of value generated by heritage and the common productive potential of local communities.
