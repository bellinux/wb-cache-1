However, older adults’ experiences of sexual difficulties remain relatively unexplored. This article draws on qualitative data collected as part of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Participants answered a Sexual Relationships and Activities Questionnaire (SRA-Q), which included an open <b>comment</b> <b>box</b> for further details, 1, 084 (1 / 7) of which were completed. These data were analyzed using Template Analysis, and findings on the experiences of sexual difficulties are presented in this article. Sexual difficulties were contextualized within the couple relationship and could be detrimental to the relationship, particularly if the partner would not seek professional help. Participants reported that sexual difficulties could also have a negative impact on psychological well-being, described mainly as frustration, depression, and sadness. For some participants the supportive nature of their relationship buffered these impacts. Few had sought professional help; those who had reported helpful and unhelpful experiences. These findings add to the limited evidence base and have implications for health care in the context of global aging and a growing recognition of older adults’ sexual rights. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Cervical spine {{injuries}} {{are a major}} burden on hospital services and have serious consequences for morbidity and mortality; this also affects society due to the associated high care and medical costs. These injuries {{have the potential to}} be missed or misdiagnosed, although it must be stated that this phenomena is not unique to cervical spine injuries, and has been seen throughout most imaging services. One possible method to counter this is the use of computer aided detection (CAD) software integrated into the imaging process. This can help increase sensitivity and specificity scores (and thus area under a curve (AUC) scores) by indicating any injuries/pathologies using a pattern recognition algorithm. Methods Lateral cervical spine images were collected from clinical cases and anonymysed by the hospital. These were segmented using a Matlab script to develop ground truth images for the computer scientists to develop cervical spine CAD (CSPINE-CAD) software using machine learning algorithms. The CSPINE CAD software was then assessed in a number of studies as described below. Participants were a convenience sample recruited at the University of Exeter and the Royal Devon and Exeter hospital, and were involved in three tests. These tests all investigated the AUC differences when making a diagnosis without, and with the CSPINE-CAD software. These three tests were: The first test involving five third year radiography students each diagnosing the same five lateral C-spine radiographs, first without and then {{with the use of the}} CSPINE-CAD software. Answers were provided by the students via a <b>comments</b> <b>box</b> in which they would make an original diagnosis, then apply the CAD software and then make a re-diagnosis. Upon completion a questionnaire was filled in about their opinions, feedback and confidence whilst using the software. The second test involved 11 third year radiography students from the same cohort each diagnosing 30 lateral C-spine radiographs. This involved using a representation of the CSPINE-CAD software, and followed the same method of diagnosis (a <b>comments</b> <b>box)</b> as in the first test, concluding with a questionnaire. The third test involved 26 participants made up of junior doctors and qualified radiographers, each diagnosing 30 radiographs without and with CSPINE-CAD. This third test did not utilise a <b>comments</b> <b>box,</b> but instead used an answer sheet which contained blank boxes representing each vertebral body and each vertebral junction. These boxes were filled in by the participant using a number between one and six (one representing no injury, and six being 80 - 100...|$|R

This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to know the}} power of Three (3) advertisement 2 ̆ 7 s narration entitled “Always On, Bebas itu nyata” towards the society.

There are two problems to be solved, namely: (1) What {{is the meaning of}} each utterances in the Three (3) advertisement “Always On, Bebas itu nyata” girl version based on Fairclough 2 ̆ 7 s three dimension model of CDA?; (2) What are society interpretations on the depiction of freedom on Three (3) advertisement “Always On, Bebas itu nyata”?. This study employs qualitative approach by using content or document analysis. Document analysis is applied because the aim {{of this study is to}} describe the meaning on Three (3) advertisement 2 ̆ 7 s utterances narration and the society 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation. The data of this research were all utterances found in Three (3) entitled “Always On, Bebas itu nyata” (girl 2 ̆ 7 s version) and the comment from internet regarding this advertisement. The writer applied several processes in collecting the data in certain order as follow: (1) downloading the complete video entitled “Always On, Bebas itu nyata” girl 2 ̆ 7 s version from Youtube, (2) transcribing the utterances by playing and pausing the video, (3) reading the whole transription of the utterances in order to check the utterances for understanding the message of advertisement, and (4) finding the society 2 ̆ 7 s comments in the Youtube 2 ̆ 7 s <b>comment</b> <b>box</b> and from the personal blogs. This present study reveals that based on society interpretation on the Three (3) advertisement narration, the society tends to see and directly related this advertisement 2 ̆ 7 s narration with the norm and culture in Indonesia without thinking about the main purpose of the advertisement maker. Finally, the writer suggests that the next researcher enrich the field of this study and possibly explore other numerous object with different theory of CDA.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree MEd education in the faculty {{of education at the}} Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyTeaching methods in the higher education sector has changed over the years from traditional teaching methods (also known as talk and chalk) to that of a more participatory level. The private higher education institution that I selected to do my study at was of the opinion that it is in order to appoint lecturers who have completed a degree and have the necessary industry experience in the field of the programme (course) to be taught at the institution. Very few, if any, lecturers have completed an education qualification such as a post graduate certificate in education or have little or no teaching experience. Moving with the challenges that education sets for educators today, {{it became clear that the}} students at this institution were no longer satisfied with the teaching methods that the lecturers used to present their classes. This information was gathered from the quarterly lecturer evaluations that were done at the institution. It is done by means of criteria in the form of a questionnaire to all students. This questionnaire was drawn up by professional educators in management and was piloted and adjustments were made before it was handed to the students. One student asked the question in the additional <b>comment</b> <b>box</b> whether the lecturers at the institution were ready for the first cohort of students who matriculated with the outcomes based education system. This was discussed with the management team of the institution and a decision was made to do a research project on the teaching methods currently used by lecturers at this institution and to underpin the study with the activity theory that originated with Vygotsky. The institution gave me the necessary ethical clearance to do the study in the business faculty. Only the business faculty and not the art, design and information technology faculty was considered when gathering information from the quarterly questionnaires issued to the students. The reason being that the feedback indicated that there were problems regarding teaching methods in only the business faculty and not in the art, design and technology information faculty. The aim and objectives of this study were to determine (1) what teaching methods are currently used by lecturers in the business faculty; (2) what the perception is of the lecturers and students towards teaching methods currently being used in theoretical subjects in the business faculty; and (3) could participatory (active) teaching methods possibly bring about the emancipation of students in the business faculty. The research methodology used to collect this information was of a quantitative and qualitative nature. Section A of the questionnaires to the lecturers and questions in section A for the focus group interviews for the students were used as quantitative data collection. Qualitative data collection was gathered from section B and C in the questionnaires for the lecturers and section B which contained the questions asked to the students in the focus group interviews. To triangulate the data collected from the lecturers (questionnaires) and that of the students (focus group interviews), observation as a qualitative method of data collection was used where at least one lecture of each lecturer who participated in this study was observed. All lecturers in the business faculty were asked to participate in this study. The total number of lecturers who participated in the study was 9 (n= 9). The total number of students in the business faculty at the time of the study was 241 of which four students (n= 4) from the business management programme, eleven students (n= 11) from the secretarial studies programme, eleven (n= 11) from the event management programme and five (n= 5) from the business marketing programme were selected to form part of the focus group interviews. All questionnaires and observation sheets were piloted before the study took place and the necessary adjustments were made. All lecturers and students were assured of their anonymity and no one’s names will be revealed to the management team of this institution. It was found that some lecturers in fact do use participatory teaching methods and one lecturer in particular made use of a method that could be likened to the flipped classroom concept. However, from the results of the questionnaire it was evident that the teaching methods of two staff members in particular were cause for. There is therefore scope for staff training to improve the teaching methods at this institution to deliver a far better service to its clients: the students, parents and industry. Recommendations for staff development as well as an improved induction programme for the novice students will be given to the management team of the institution...|$|E

Reviewed by Me-Linh Le Health Sciences Librarian, Health Sciences Library, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Email: meplinh. le@usask. caObjective - The primary {{objective of this}} study was to gather quantitative information on the need, development, acquisition, and application of pedagogical knowledge by academic librarians with teaching responsibilities. Design - Online survey questionnaire. Setting - Higher-education (HE) institutions (i. e., post-secondary institutions such as colleges and universities) in the United Kingdom. Subjects - Subject librarieans from 82 HE libraries (One from each). Methods - Of the 191 HE institutions in the United Kingdom (determined via a now-unavailable directory), 137 supplied an online staff directory with contact information. One subject librarian from each HE institution was contacted; librarians were selected from the online directory by taking a name systematically from a different point in each listing (i. e., first, second, third, etc). Each librarian was sent an email that contained an introductory message as well as a link to the questionnaire. The online questionnaire was created using Survey Monkey and piloted before and after input. It employed mostly multiple-choice tick boxes as well as open-ended questions and <b>comment</b> <b>boxes.</b> The 35 -question survey questionnaire was developed in part through email interviews with two leading researchers in the field (identified via the literature). Responses were received from 82 librarians (60 %). The answers were analyzed and cross-tabulated using SPSS. Komogorov-Smirnov tests were done to determine the significance of some results. Open-ended questions and <b>comment</b> <b>boxes</b> were placed into categories using Microsoft Excel to identify patters and themes. Main Results - The 82 librarians who responded to the survey came from a wide variety of backgrounds: the majority were subject librarians from Arts & Humanities (31 %), had spent more than ten years in their position (38 %), worked full-time (71 %), were members of pre- 1992 HE institutions (59 %), and went by the job title of Subject Librarian (30 %) (or a slight variation thereof) ...|$|R
