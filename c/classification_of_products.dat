40|$|Abstract—This paper {{applies the}} {{product life cycle}} theory to the issue <b>of</b> <b>product</b> line {{management}} with two goals in mind: 1) to understand how product line management evolves {{over the life of}} an industry and 2) to compare Klepper’s model (1986), which emphasizes economies of scale, with the traditional model <b>of</b> the <b>product</b> life cycle, which emphasizes dominant designs. We find that Klepper’s model <b>of</b> the <b>product</b> life cycle theory in combination with the concept <b>of</b> <b>product</b> line management provides a better explanation for the evolution of competition in the mobile phone industry than the traditional product life cycle model.
