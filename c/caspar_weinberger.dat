5|$|In August 1971, {{just after}} {{conclusion}} of the Apollo 15 mission, President Richard Nixon proposed canceling the two remaining lunar landing missions, Apollo 16 and 17. Office of Management and Budget Deputy Director <b>Caspar</b> <b>Weinberger</b> was opposed to this, and persuaded Nixon to keep the remaining missions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{investigations}} ensued, including by the U.S. Congress and the three-person, Reagan-appointed Tower Commission. Neither {{found any}} evidence that President Reagan himself knew {{of the extent of}} the multiple programs. Ultimately the sale of weapons to Iran was not deemed a criminal offense but charges were brought against five individuals for their support of the Contras. Those charges, however, were later dropped because the administration refused to declassify certain documents. The indicted conspirators faced various lesser charges instead. In the end, fourteen administration officials were indicted, including then-Secretary of Defense <b>Caspar</b> <b>Weinberger.</b> Eleven convictions resulted, some of which were vacated on appeal. The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned {{in the final days of}} the presidency of George H.W. Bush, who had been Vice President at the time of the affair. The Iran-Contra Affair and the ensuing deception to protect senior administration officials including President Reagan has been cast as an example of post-truth politics.|$|E
5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, <b>Caspar</b> <b>Weinberger,</b> and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} that chair.|$|E

However, they did not live {{together}} {{until the end of}} World War II. They moved to San Francisco, <b>Caspar</b> <b>Weinberger's</b> hometown, after the war.|$|R
5000|$|The White House {{continued}} its neutrality; Reagan famously declared {{at the time}} that he could not understand why two allies were arguing over [...] "that little ice-cold bunch of land down there". But he assented to Haig and Secretary of Defense <b>Caspar</b> <b>Weinberger's</b> position. Haig briefly (8-30 April) headed a [...] "shuttle diplomacy" [...] mission between London and Buenos Aires. According to a BBC documentary titled [...] "The Falklands War and the White House", <b>Caspar</b> <b>Weinberger's</b> Department of Defense began a number of non-public actions to support and supply the British military while Haig's shuttle diplomacy was still ongoing. Haig's message to the Argentines was that the British would indeed fight, and that the US would support Britain, but at the time he was not aware that America was already providing support.|$|R

5|$|White House Counsel Fred Fielding {{immediately}} {{prepared for}} a transfer of presidential powers under the 25th Amendment, and Chief of Staff James A. Baker and Counselor to the President Edwin Meese went to Reagan's hospital still believing {{that the president was}} unharmed. Within five minutes of the shooting, members of the Cabinet began gathering in the White House Situation Room. Haig, Defense Secretary <b>Caspar</b> <b>Weinberger</b> and National Security Advisor Richard Allen discussed various issues, including the location of the nuclear football, the apparent presence of more than the usual number of Soviet submarines unusually close off the Atlantic coast, a possible Soviet invasion of Poland against the Solidarity movement, and the presidential line of succession. Although normally no tape recorders are allowed in the Situation Room these meetings were recorded with the participants' knowledge by Allen, and the tapes have since been made public.|$|E
25|$|Several {{high-ranking}} Bechtel {{executives at}} times held important {{positions in the}} United States government.

25|$|Bilateral {{military}} cooperation deepened under the Ronald Reagan {{administration in the}} 1980s. In 1981, U.S. Secretary of Defense <b>Caspar</b> <b>Weinberger</b> and Israeli Minister of Defense Ariel Sharon signed the Strategic Cooperation Agreement, establishing a framework for continued consultation and cooperation to enhance the national security of both countries. In November 1983, the two sides formed a Joint Political Military Group, which still meets twice a year, to implement most provisions of the MOU. Joint air and sea military exercises began in June 1984, and the United States has constructed facilities to stockpile military equipment in Israel.|$|E

Philip and Elizabeth plant a bug in <b>Caspar</b> <b>Weinberger's</b> office, and begin listening for vital intelligence. After a mole in the KGB is realized, Elizabeth and Philip are kidnapped and tortured by KGB operatives posing as FBI agents. Philip believes that because Elizabeth's torturing stops, it was she who told the KGB that he considered defecting. Philip is upset that Elizabeth trusts the KGB more than she trusts him.|$|R

When the KGB begin to suspect a mole in their midst, they send operatives posing as FBI agents to kidnap and torture Elizabeth and Philip {{in order to}} test their loyalty. Elizabeth is hurt and angry that the people to whom she has devoted her life could treat her with such distrust, while Philip accuses Elizabeth of incurring the KGB's suspicions by reporting to them he had considered defecting. She denies this, admitting only that she had told their handlers that he liked living in the U.S. more than he should. Elizabeth and Philip later reconcile, but subsequently separate when Elizabeth discovers Philip had an affair with his former girlfriend, Irina. Philip moves out and into a motel.|$|R

Elizabeth is forced to kill the officer after he tells her that he needs to run a police check on the van they are using. They listen to a recording from Weinberger's office, where they learn Haig may have coordinates to the U.S.'s nuclear missiles. Philip suggests they find out more, but Elizabeth says they need to report back to The Centre. Philip tells her that her commitment to the mission is blinding her judgement.|$|R

500|$|During his {{election}} campaign in 1988, Vice President Bush denied {{any knowledge of}} the Iran–Contra affair by saying he was [...] "out of the loop". Though his diaries included that he was [...] "one {{of the few people}} that know fully the details", he repeatedly refused to discuss the incident and won the election. However, a book published in 2008 by Israeli journalist and terrorism expert Ronen Bergman asserts that Bush was personally and secretly briefed on the affair by Amiram Nir, counterterrorism adviser to the then Israeli Prime Minister, when Bush was on a visit to Israel. [...] "Nir could have incriminated the incoming President. The fact that Nir was killed in a mysterious chartered airplane crash in Mexico in December 1988 has given rise to numerous conspiracy theories", writes Bergman. On December 24, 1992, nearing the end of his term in office after being defeated by Bill Clinton the previous month, Bush pardoned six administration officials, namely Elliott Abrams, Duane Clarridge, Alan Fiers, Clair George, Robert McFarlane, and <b>Caspar</b> <b>Weinberger.</b>|$|E
500|$|On 17 June 1985, National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane wrote a National Security Decision Directive {{which called}} for the United States to begin a {{rapprochement}} with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The paper read:Dynamic political evolution is taking place inside Iran. Instability caused by {{the pressures of the}} Iraq-Iran war, economic deterioration and regime in-fighting create the potential for major changes inside Iran. The Soviet Union is better positioned than the U.S. to exploit and benefit from any power struggle that results in changes from the Iranian regime...The U.S should encourage Western allies and friends to help Iran meet its import requirements so as to reduce the attractiveness of Soviet assistance...This includes provision of selected military equipment. Defense Secretary <b>Caspar</b> <b>Weinberger</b> was highly negative, writing on his copy of McFarlane's paper: [...] "This is almost too absurd to comment on...like asking Qaddafi to Washington for a cozy chat." [...] Secretary of State George Shultz was also opposed, stating that having designated Iran a State Sponsor of Terrorism in January 1984, how could the United States possibly sell arms to Iran? Only the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency William Casey supported McFarlane's plan to start selling arms to Iran.|$|E
500|$|While President Ronald Reagan was a {{supporter}} of the Contra cause, the evidence is disputed as to whether he authorized the diversion of the money raised by the Iranian arms sales to the Contras. Handwritten notes taken by Defense Secretary <b>Caspar</b> <b>Weinberger</b> on December 7, 1985, indicate that Reagan was aware of potential hostage transfers with Iran, as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to [...] "moderate elements" [...] within that country. Weinberger wrote that Reagan said [...] "he could answer to charges of illegality but couldn't answer to the charge that 'big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free the hostages. After the weapon sales were revealed in November 1986, Reagan appeared on national television and stated that the weapons transfers had indeed occurred, but that the United States did not trade arms for hostages. The investigation was impeded when large volumes of documents relating to the scandal were destroyed or withheld from investigators by Reagan administration officials. On March 4, 1987, Reagan returned to the airwaves in a nationally televised address, taking full responsibility, and saying that [...] "what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages".|$|E
5000|$|Anderson {{was active}} in {{opposing}} deployment of the MX missile in new protective silos. Support for MX was based on claims by defense officials that a [...] "window of vulnerability" [...] existed in the Minuteman missile system—that the Soviet Union could achieve first-strike capability. Alarmed at Defense Secretary <b>Caspar</b> <b>Weinberger's</b> announcement that the U.S. intended to seek such capability for itself, Anderson believed that data showing danger of Soviet first-strike capability was greatly exaggerated. He authored seven papers between 1979 and 1983 opposing MX, in which he maintained there was no [...] "window of vulnerability," [...] due to known margins of error in the reliability, accuracy and testing of missile systems. He also founded a program called International Peace Issues Forum, for students to discuss arms control and disarmament issues.
