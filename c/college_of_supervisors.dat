40|$|Whenever a {{financial}} crisis occurs, threatening a possible financial meltdown, central banks {{have to be at}} the forefront in combating, neutralizing the crisis and restoring financial stability and economic growth. In this regard, the present sub-prime crisis which originated from the US highlights a few key issues for SEACEN central banks. This paper reviews the policy responses to the crisis which include exit policy strategies from stimulus monetary packages. To strengthen the soundness of the financial system going forward, the paper also highlights counter-cyclical and macro-prudential regulations that central banks may want to actively look into. These include cross-border policy cooperation and coordination, particularly {{in the form of the}} <b>college</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervisors.</b> (This paper has also been published in the Journal of Advanced Studies in Finance, Vol. 1, Issue 1 (1), Summer 2010, [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Papers in {{this volume}} can be read individually, but jointly create a story of EU {{interaction}} with accession state: both thorugh positive and negative impacts. Papers provide perspectives {{on the impact of}} EU accession on culture, primarily in terms of risk perception which was long viewed as highly undesirable in non-western countries, on education systems as important carriers of knowledge and culture, on communication and media which serve as a basis for creating public opinion and therefore generating potential for positive changes, and tourism as an important industry that has strongly transformed as a result of EU enlargements. The first set of contributions focuses on managing cultural changes at diffetrent levels to adjust the values and norms of interacting parties. One such important aspect is the risk tolerance of a nation (but also at other levels), as conseptualized by Hofsteade (1980). In an accession process, numerous risks are arising, such as unknown impacts of accession. However, risk exhibits important impact on adjusting the culture to market and entrepreneurial economy of the EU. As Alfirevi et al. indicate, for such changes some individuals, organizations, or even societies seem to have better starting positions 'to feign control over the uncontrollable' (Beck, 2002), i. e. to project and act upon the future-oriented insights". In their contribution they provide management approaches that provide insights primarily at corporate levels: how to manage the future in the face of uncertainties that accessions bring. In Wittine's contribution, discussion focuses on external perceptions of risk, i. e. on the perceptions of EU investors on political risks in Croatia. Although author discusses great potential benefits from accession in terms of reducing political risks, he stresses that "in the end, it is {{important to point out that}} mere EU accession is not the panacea that would heal the problems the Croatian economy faces today. Structural economic, legal and social reforms behind the accession are the ones issues that matter and the ones that would bring the biggest benefit. "Although investments can have great positive impacts on local economiy, there are numerous potential risk associated with different goals of partnets from EU and accession country. In his contribution, Subic discusses the benefits and shortfalls of vigorous privatization and internationalization of banking sector. While having direct benefits from capital inflows, but also knowledge inflows, the risks that Croatian banking system incurred as a result of great control of international banks (primarily Italian and Austrian) required adjustment of Croatian National Bank to control their activities through <b>college</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervisors.</b> Moreover, control has to transcend borders as many of the strategic decisions regarding Croatian banks are made in EU countries. Strong integration of Croatian banking system into EU banking system created a great infrastructure for easier movement of capital to where the investment opportunities arise. Besides the tolerance for risk and managing risk, culture changed in several other aspects. Draskovic and Gnjidic discuss consumer attitudes toward environmental issues and adjustment of Croatian environmental management policies to EU directives. This issue grows in importance with elimination of borders which will enhance movement of tourists. As EU directives provide more guidelines and minimum requirements, touristis by changing locations make choices: whether to maintain environmental consciousness and inform themselves about the local regulations, or to ignore such practices while not in their home country. One of the issues that authors discuss is: who should be responsible for development / maintainance of environmentally friendly behaviours: individuals or institutionalized efforts?

40|$|Th is paper, {{based on}} presentations before audiences in Lisbon, {{provides}} an overview of the causes of the credit crisis and discusses one of the reports issued in the wake thereof, the De Larosière Report. Its main findings in respect of financial sector regulation are reviewed: a single European rulebook, <b>colleges</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervisors,</b> deposit guarantee schemes, bank resolution regimes and ‘living wills’ as well as transparent corporate structures of banks. The proposals {{for the establishment of a}} European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and a European System <b>of</b> Financial <b>Supervisors</b> (ESFS) are described and subjected to critical reviews, both from a legal angle and from a broader perspective. Emphasis is given to the European Banking Authority (EBA), as one of the agencies within the ESFS. Suggestions are made to broaden the legal underpinning of the proposals in order to place the new bodies on a firm footing. This paper argues that, even though major steps toward a stronger Union-wide response to difficulties in the financial sector, the De Larosière proposals and the Commission’s legislative follow-up do not provide an adequate response to the lessons from the crisis. Federal authority for overseeing the financial sector is required: this implies Treaty change...|$|R

40|$|Cross-border banking {{services}} by African banks within Africa {{have been on}} the rise since the last decade. As these services are provided predominantly by complex financial institutions and involve operating within a number of African financial systems, effective regulation of such entities can be challenging. The challenges are two-fold: regulating complex financial institutions on a consolidated basis and achieving effective supervisory cooperation between home and host country regulators of these banking entities, which is critical given the cross-border nature of the services they provide. Regulation is particularly significant due to the linkages of all financial systems involved in the operation of cross-border {{banking services}} and also the ease and speed with which a crisis can spread from one jurisdiction to another - as the last global financial crisis revealed. This chapter, as such, assesses the legal and regulatory challenges inherent in the delivery of cross-border services by African banks within Africa and proposes solutions for making the operation of such services safer. Section one considers the reasons for the rise of African cross-border banks and their effect on African banking systems. Section two considers the legal and regulatory challenges inherent in their operations. Section three provides a critical appraisal of solutions for the legal and regulatory challenges by assessing the extent to which consolidated supervision, memorandums of understanding and the operation <b>of</b> <b>colleges</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervisors,</b> mitigate these challenges.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to examine the roles that college {{supervisors}} perform in the Field Experience programme with particular reference to the Field Experience programme in a Catholic <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Education. Through clarification of the roles it was expected that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>supervisors</b> would be improved resulting in a more efficient and productive Field Experience programme at the institution concerned. The overall aims of the study were: (1) to clarify the roles <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>supervisors</b> (2) to improve the quality of the Field Experience programme (3) to give the programme more meaning in the teacher education course at the College concerned and (4) to make it clear to participants in such a programme that there is an important role for college supervisors to play. The study involved the co-operation of 62 student teachers, 45 classroom teachers (country and city) and 10 college lecturers (totalling 117). A questionnaire was designed on the basis of discussions with Field Experience participants, on a survey conducted the previous year, and on an open-ended survey conducted immediately after the mid-year Block Practicum. The final questionnaire was then distributed to 82 student teachers (75. 5 % return), 76 classroom teachers (58. 5 % return) and 11 college lecturers (90 % return). The study made use of earlier work by Waters (1973) and also by Duck and Cunningham (1985). In the study, student teachers, classroom teachers and college lecturers were surveyed by means of a questionnaire to rate the frequency with which specific supervisory tasks (already identified in a pilot study) were performed. This involved rating each of the supervisory tasks twice; firstly rating, the 'actual' occurrence of the task and secondly by rating the 'ideal' occurrence of the task. Results of the study showed that there are differences of perception surrounding role expectations for college supervisors and that these roles require clarification. What were perceived to be the roles for and the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>supervisors</b> contrasted with what was actually exhibited. Students and teachers (country and city) perceived college supervisors to be actually performing an Evaluator role; while lecturers perceived a Manager role. The 'ideal' role for college supervisors was perceived by all respondent groups to involve the functions and tasks of Manager. The degree of role conflict present indicates that follow-up measures deserve consideration and clarification and that orientation and learning programmes need to be conducted for all Field Experience participants in order to give the Field Experience programme more significance and to improve its overall effectiveness. A result of the study and one which could be emphasised in order to improve the quality of the programme was the indication of 'desirable' and 'undesirable' characteristics <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>supervisors</b> who were involved in the Field Experience programme at the College concerned. These results were similar to the earlier work of Beer et al. (1983) and were indicated by' the use of openended comments being included at the conclusion of the questionnaire. These comments concerned the personal and professional characteristics <b>of</b> <b>college</b> <b>supervisors</b> and together with this author's work could form the basis of further study as a step towards increasing the efficiency of Field Experience programmes...|$|R

40|$|Australasian and New Zealand Association for Medical EducationThe Royal Australian and New Zealand <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Psychiatrists {{requires}} <b>supervisors</b> {{to fulfil}} formative and summative assessment roles, {{in addition to}} the traditional teaching role. There is currently little in the literature regarding how well equipped supervisors are to act as formative assessors, how they feel about this role, and how their trainees perceive their assessment from supervisors. This paper is an attempt to systematically explore these issues and consider the ramifications <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> as the provider of formative assessments. Fifteen trainees and 21 supervisors were interviewed and the resultant data subjected to qualitative analysis. Trainees were generally very negative in their opinions about the formative assessment instruments used by their supervisors and the validity and reliability <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> assessments. They saw these assessments as subjective and allowing for very low standards. Supervisors were similarly concerned that their formative assessments were subjective, that they were not appropriately trained for the role, and that they did not want the role. The findings of this study have serious implications for the College, given that supervisors formatively assess trainees. The usefulness of their assessments may be doubtful, and further evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>supervisor</b> as assessor - formative and summative - is required, including the efficacy of training for this role.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} a new topic in the study <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support. Previous measures <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support have focused almost exclusively on availability of that support. In this paper the author introduces a new construct <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support. It also investigates the relationship between use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support and the Big Five personality traits. Utilizing a cross-sectional research design, the author surveyed 227 (useable surveys) adults using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The findings suggest that use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support is distinct from the availability <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support. Use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support was negatively associated with subordinate???s perceptions of workplace stressors (e. g. organizational constraints & interpersonal conflict at work), while also negatively associated with negative job affect while controlling for the availability <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support. These results provide evidence that use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support is an important construct in the supervisor-subordinate relationship. Regarding the relationship between use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support and personality, agreeableness was the only personality trait associated with both use of emotional and instrumental supervisor support while controlling for all Big Five Personality traits. Conscientiousness was also uniquely associated with use <b>of</b> instrumental <b>supervisor</b> support, but not use <b>of</b> emotional <b>supervisor</b> support. In conclusion, use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support can be a considered an important addition to organizational research and the understanding <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support...|$|R
