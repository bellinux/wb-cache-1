It will {{be remembered}} that we {{resolved}} to give generally the term [...] "coherent" [...] to those rocks which appeared to be composed of one <b>compact</b> <b>substance,</b> not of several materials. But, as in all the arrangements of Nature we find that her several classes pass into each other by imperceptible gradations, {{and that there is}} no ruling of red lines between one and the other, we need not suppose that we shall find any plainly distinguishable limit between the crystalline and coherent rocks. Sometimes, indeed, a very distinctly marked crystalline will be joined by a coherent rock so sharply and neatly {{that it is possible to}} break off specimens, no larger than a walnut, containing portions of each; but far more frequently the transition from one to the other is effected gradually; or, if not, there exist, at any rate, in other places intervening, a series of rocks which possess an imperfectly crystalline character, passing down into that of simple coherence. This transition is usually effected through the different kinds of slate; the slaty crystallines becoming more and more fine in texture, until at last they appear composed of nothing but very fine mica or chlorite; and this mass of micaceous substance becomes more and more compact and silky in texture, losing its magnesia, and containing more of the earth which forms the substance of clay, until at last it assumes the familiar appearance of roofing-slate, the noblest example of the coherent rocks. I call it the noblest, as being the nearest to the crystallines, and possessing much in common with them. Connected with this well-known substance are enormous masses of other rocks, more or less resembling it in character, of which the following are universal characteristics.|$|E

30|$|Several {{reports in}} the medical {{literature}} have emphasized that in athletes, and particularly in swimmers, related effects are found concerning bone metabolism and muscular-postural activity. In swimmers, Riazanova[19] showed uniform and symmetrical lengthening of the metacarpal bones and thickening of their <b>compact</b> <b>substance</b> due to adaptation to the physical loading. Yamada et al.[20] demonstrated that swimming in rats promotes cartilage formation and bone remodelling. Magkos et al.[21] studied the type and intensity of exercise and the effects on bone mineral density; they reported that sprint athletes have significantly greater bone mineral density, and endurance swimmers have significantly lower bone mineral density than other athletes. In comparing the maximum isometric bite forces of sedentary versus physically trained subjects, Sannajust et al.[22] concluded {{that the practice of}} a sport can increase masseter muscle fatigability and will thereby affect posture.|$|E
50|$|In 1892, a {{group of}} entrepreneurs, who {{believed}} there was oil located in the Coorong, drilled Australia's first oil well. They were unsuccessful, as it was later discovered that the 'oil' {{was in fact a}} flammable, <b>compacted</b> vegetable <b>substance</b> (known as 'coorongite'). A replica of the oil rig has been built as a monument to this enterprise.|$|R
25|$|The term {{diagenesis}} is used {{to describe}} all the chemical, physical, and biological changes, exclusive of surface weathering, undergone by a sediment after its initial deposition. Some of those processes cause the sediment to consolidate into a <b>compact,</b> solid <b>substance</b> from the originally loose material. Young sedimentary rocks, especially those of Quaternary age (the most recent period of the geologic time scale) are often still unconsolidated. As sediment deposition builds up, the overburden (lithostatic) pressure rises, and {{a process known as}} lithification takes place.|$|R
60|$|Meantime {{the road}} in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These {{enthusiastic}} admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup, which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide, ambushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's blinds were down; but by-and-by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but pleasurable thrill to find themselves {{face to face with the}} Extraordinary Man who had filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he sat--not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, <b>compact</b> of <b>substance,</b> and almost within touching distance with the hand.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe work {{presents}} the results of experimental and numerical investigations into the natural frequencies of grid structure containing parts made of materials with significantly different elastic modulus. A good example of such structure is human thorax. Firstly, the elastic properties of bone and cartilage materials were obtained by using bending and compression tests. The elastic modulus of the <b>compact</b> <b>substance</b> of the bone is 8 … 12 GPa, coastal cartilage – 70 … 90 MPa. The maximum failure force and bending strength were defined under the bending impact test (using a drop tower impact system). This bone strength is ∼ 175 MPa (1. 5 [...] . 2 times more of the values obtained in static bending). Then, a three-dimensional model of a human thorax was developed allowing one to predict their mode shapes and the natural frequencies using the finite element method (ANSYS software). The verification of the model was carried out by comparing the experimental (in vivo) and numerical natural frequencies of a human thorax...|$|E

The experiments ran in as much quite negatively as the applied cloudy medium that let the x-rays happen exactly just as easily as the water in compound with the membrane of compact substance; only the resin solution showed a small, but possibly coincidental difference in the permeability, but so, as if the cloudy medium would have been more transparent. One does not have to conclude from experiments that the x-rays do not change with the passage by cloudy medium, anyhow is weakened their effect on the photographic plate.

40|$|Anticellulite topical gel {{preparation}} with caffeine as active ingredient needs a penetration enhancer to reach subcutaneous layer. Sodium hyaluronate (NaHA), the {{sodium salt of}} hyaluronic acid, is a hydrophilic polysaccharide derivative polymer. It has ability to enhance percutaneous penetration by loosening the dense of the <b>compact</b> <b>substance</b> stratum corneum. The aim {{of this research was}} to observe the effects of NaHA on caffeine penetration as anticellulite active agent in three types of gel preparation: hydrogel, hydroalcoholic gel, and gel emulsion. Each gel type contained caffeine 1, 5 % and was varied into three formulas. Formula 1 contained HPMC 2 % as gel basis; formula 2 contained HPMC 2 % and NaHA 0, 5 %; formula 3 contained NaHA 2 % as gel basis. Caffeine penetration properties were analyzed by Franz diffusion cell in vitro test using rat skin as membrane. Percent caffeine penetration of hydrogel formula 1, 2, 3 were 9, 41 ± 0, 01 %; 11, 74 ± 0, 13 %; 16, 32 ± 0, 03 %, respectively. Percent caffeine penetration of hydroalcoholic gel formula 1, 2, 3 were 19, 54 ± 0, 02 %; 22, 99 ± 0, 23 %; 7, 42 ± 0, 08 %, respectively. Percent caffeine penetration of gel emulsion formula 1, 2, 3 were 10, 47 ± 0, 19 %; 13, 41 ± 0, 12 %; 18, 42 ± 0, 06 %, respectively.

5000|$|All of the {{structures}} of the earth, Sumeru and the rest, extend downward {{to a depth of}} 80,000 yojanas below sea level - the same as the height of Sumeru above sea level. Below this is a layer of [...] "golden earth", a <b>substance</b> <b>compact</b> and firm enough to support the weight of Sumeru. It is 320,000 yojanas in depth and so extends to 400,000 yojanas below sea level. The layer of golden earth in turn rests upon a layer of water, which is 8,000,000 yojanas in depth, going down to 8,400,000 yojanas below sea level. Below the layer of water is a [...] "circle of wind", which is 16,000,000 yojanas in depth and also much broader in extent, supporting 1,000 different worlds upon it. Yojanas are equivalent to about 13 km (8 mi).|$|R
60|$|The {{magistrate}} {{then proceeded}} {{to the place where}} the corpse was first discovered, and made those who had found it give, upon the spot, a particular and detailed account of {{the manner in which it}} was lying. A large fragment of the rock appeared to have accompanied, or followed, the fall of the victim from the cliff above. It was of so solid and <b>compact</b> a <b>substance</b> that it had fallen without any great diminution by splintering; so that the Sheriff was enabled, first, to estimate the weight by measurement, and then to calculate, from the appearance of the fragment, what portion of it had been bedded into the cliff from which it had descended. This was easily detected by the raw appearance of the stone where it had not been exposed to the atmosphere. They then ascended the cliff, and surveyed the place from whence the stony fragment had fallen. It seemed plain, from the appearance of the bed, that the mere weight of one man standing upon the projecting part of the fragment, supposing it in its original situation, could not have destroyed its balance and precipitated it, with himself, from the cliff. At the same time, it appeared to have lain so loose that the use of a lever, or the combined strength of three or four men, might easily have hurled it from its position. The short turf about the brink of the precipice was much trampled, as if stamped by the heels of men in a mortal struggle, or in the act of some violent exertion. Traces of the same kind, less visibly marked, guided the sagacious investigator to the verge of the copsewood, which in that place crept high up the bank towards the top of the precipice.|$|R
6000|$|... § 4. It {{has been}} said that this group of rocks is {{distinguished}} by its incapability of being separated into sheets. This is only true of it in small portions, for it is usually deposited in beds or layers of irregular thickness, which are easily separable from each other; and when, as not unfrequently happens, some of these beds are only half an inch or a quarter of an inch thick, the rock appears to break into flat plates like a slaty coherent. But this appearance is deceptive. However thin the bed may be, it will be found that it is in its own <b>substance</b> <b>compact,</b> and not separable into two other beds; but the true slaty coherents possess a delicate slatiness of structure, carried into their most minute portions, so that however thin a piece of them may be, it is usually possible, if we have instruments fine enough, to separate it into two still thinner flakes. As, however, the slaty and compact crystallines, so also the slaty and compact coherents pass into each other by subtle gradations, and present many intermediate conditions, very obscure and indefinable.|$|R
6000|$|... § 5. Now, {{although}} these three great groups of rocks do indeed often pass {{into each other}} by imperceptible gradations, and although their peculiar aspect is never a severe indication of their relative ages, yet their characters {{are for the most}} part so defined as to make a strong impression on the mind of an ordinary observer, and their age is also for the most part approximately indicated by their degrees of hardness, and crystalline aspect. It does, indeed, sometimes happen that a soft and slimy clay will pass into a rock like Aberdeen granite by transitions so subtle that no point of separation can be determined; and it very often happens that rocks like Aberdeen granite are of more recent formation than certain beds of sandstone and limestone. But, in spite of all these uncertainties and exceptions, I believe that unless actual pains be taken to efface from the mind its natural impressions, the idea of three great classes of rocks and earth will maintain its ground in the thoughts of the general observer; that whether he desire it or not, he will find himself throwing the soft and loose clays and sands together under one head; placing the hard rocks, of a dull, <b>compact,</b> homogeneous <b>substance,</b> under another head; and the hardest rocks, of a crystalline, glittering, and various substance, under a third head; and having done this, he will also find that, with certain easily admissible exceptions, these three classes of rocks are, in every district which he examines, of three different ages; that the softest are the youngest, the hard and homogeneous ones are older, and the crystalline are the oldest; and he will, perhaps, in the end, find it a somewhat inconvenient piece of respect to the complexity and accuracy of modern geological science, if he refuse to the three classes, thus defined in his imagination, their ancient title of Tertiary, Secondary, and Primary.|$|R
40|$|Received on: 16 - 12 - 2008; Accepted on: 25 - 02 - 2009 The {{technique}} of liquisolid preparation {{is used to}} formulate drug solution in solid dosage forms. Drug solution is generally, prepared by dissolving the drug in non-volatile water-miscible solvent. The prepared tablet of liquisolid formulation contains the drug held in solution. Accordingly, the dissolution step, a pre-requiste for drug absorption, may be bypassed and better bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs achieved. Liquisolid system refers to formulations formed by conversion of liquid drugs, drug suspensions or drug solution in non-volatile solvents into dry, nonadherent, free-flowing and compressible powder mixtures by blending the suspension or solution with selected carriers and coating materials. In this technique the drug {{might be in a}} solid dosage form, which is held within the powder substrate in solution, or in a solubilized, almost molecularly dispersed state. Therefore, due to their significantly increased wetting properties and surface of drug available for dissolution. Liquisolid <b>compacts</b> of water-insoluble <b>substances</b> may be expected to display enhanced drug release properties and consequently improved bioavailability. Liquisolid technique is a new and promising method that can change the dissolution rate of drugs. It is claimed that if hydrophobic carriers such as Eudragit RL and RS are used instead of hydrophilic carries in liquisolid systems, sustained release systems can be obtained...|$|R
