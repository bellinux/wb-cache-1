50|$|During {{criticism}} of party leader Carole James, Horgan remained loyal. Following her resignation, the 51 year old Horgan put himself {{forward for the}} leadership position. Policy platforms he campaigned on included {{a comprehensive review of}} laxatives under a Fair Tax Commission, expanding the carbon tax to include the exempted large industrial emitters, getting the Evergreen Line and light rail to the Western Communities built, implementing the recommendations of the Select Standing <b>Committee</b> <b>on</b> <b>Aquaculture,</b> continuing the ban on North Coast tanker traffic and offshore oil exploration, and introducing an Endangered Species Act. He was endorsed by Robin Austin, Gary Coons, Kathy Corrigan, Scott Fraser, Maurine Karagianis, Bill Routley, Shane Simpson, and Claire Trevena, as well as Harry Lali and Nicholas Simons after they dropped out of the race. Opinion polling placed Horgan in third behind Adrian Dix and Mike Farnworth, but seen as a suitable compromise candidate between the party's preferred stronger candidate of Dix and the more likable Farnworth. Dix went on to win and assigned Horgan back to the role of critic for the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources which Doug Donaldson had overseen during the leadership election, as well as adding house leader to his duties.|$|E

50|$|As the 38th Parliament began, Fraser {{opened a}} {{constituency}} office in Port Alberni. That Port Alberni suffered heavy damage during a flooding event in November 2006 {{and a second}} office, this one in Qualicum Beach, was opened in 2007. Party leader Carole James appointed Fraser to be the BC NDP critic on aboriginal issues. He {{was appointed to the}} Select Standing <b>Committee</b> <b>on</b> Aboriginal Affairs but the committee was never convened. On aboriginal issues, Fraser supported Premier Campbell's declaration that aboriginal peoples constitute a nation, and encouraged the Premier to recognize the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Fraser supported the decision to remove, from the legislature, murals depicting aboriginal people in what was seen as historically inaccurate and offensive situations. Fraser was also appointed to the Special <b>Committee</b> <b>on</b> Sustainable <b>Aquaculture</b> which met in the first three sessions, from November 2005 to May 2007. He was previously employed by a shellfish farm, but remained critical of open-net fish farms which interfere with wild salmon populations, like those in the Broughton Archipelago, and the measures that must be taken to control sea lice.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{review and}} {{addresses}} the major {{effects of climate}} change <b>on</b> <b>Aquaculture,</b> whose contributions to agriculture development are quite enormous. To achieve these objectives the status of this sub sector to the total fish supply are therefore analyzed with a view to identifying the major impacts of climate change <b>on</b> <b>aquaculture.</b> Aquaculture not practiced evenly across the globe requires an evaluation of the {{effects of climate change}} through the current aquaculture practices in the regions and the different environments. The main elements of climate change that would impact <b>on</b> <b>aquaculture</b> production include sea level and temperature rise, change in monsoon patterns and extreme climatic events and water stress, among others thereby causing varying degrees of concern either positively or negatively or directly or indirectly. Therefore, to ameliorate this adverse effect of climate change <b>on</b> <b>aquaculture</b> in Nigeria, and the world generally, attempts are made to deal with the climate change effects on the different culture systems in order to bring out all the complex attributes of climate change and the possible mitigation strategies for the future control. These will enhance aquaculture production and then claim back the expected role as a major source of animal protein in the future...|$|R

2500|$|In the 38th Parliament of British Columbia the BC NDP, with Trevena, {{formed the}} Official Opposition. She was {{selected}} for the bi-partisan Special <b>Committee</b> <b>on</b> Sustainable <b>Aquaculture</b> to deliver recommendations {{on the development of}} fish farms in BC. NDP leader Carole James assigned Trevena to be the official critic to the Employment and Income Assistance ministry, headed by BC Liberal Claude Richmond. She supported the 2005 review of welfare rates in which she advocated for earning exemptions and opposed the ministry providing welfare recipients with [...] "free socks, T-shirts and travel mugs" [...] in exchange for authorizing direct deposits of welfare cheques into a bank account. She chastised Richmond after an internal survey of ministry employees reported very morale and revealed he was ignoring staff recommendations. On local issues, Trevena lobbied the government to intervene in the bankruptcy of a Port Alice pulp mill. While the mill was 87 {{years old at the time}} and required equipment upgrades and environmental remediation, it also comprised 80% of Port Alice's tax base and was one of only a few mills in the world that produced specialty products using dissolving sulphite pulp; the province eventually directed $800,000 to Port Alice to cover the loss of the 2005 property taxes, facilitated the sale of the mill to a Swiss investment company for $1, and provided $7.5 million for site remediation. When another mill was facing closure (Elk Falls sawmill in February 2008), Minister of Forests Rich Coleman declined to offer provincial assistance but recognized Trevena for her efforts helping keep the Port Alice mill open. Trevena backed the creation of the North Coast Trail through Cape Scott Provincial Park, but opposed efforts at developing private accommodations in the park. During the debate over whether the Vancouver Island Health Authority should build a new hospital or renovate existing facilities in Campbell River and Comox, Trevena campaigned in support of renovating the existing hospitals. When the Health Authority chose to build a new $306-million, 230-bed facility near Courtenay instead, Trevena lobbied Minister of Health George Abbott not to approve the decision, and continued to publicly campaign in support of the renovations. She delivered an 18,775 signature petition to the Legislative Assembly requesting Abbott to not approve the Health Authority's plan; the Health Authority eventually relented and upgraded the two smaller hospitals.|$|R
