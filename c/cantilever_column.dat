Firstly, linear buckling {{analysis of the}} <b>cantilever</b> <b>column</b> with linear-elastic material was used to select appropriate element type and element size for this problem. Then linear buckling and nonlinear buckling analyses for an imperfect <b>cantilever</b> <b>column</b> under different horizontal loads or displacements {{in the context of}} elasticity were performed to verify the ability of the linear buckling analysis to include large geometric changes.

40|$|Seismic shear {{magnification}} in {{the columns}} of multi-storey precast structures entering far into inelastic domain is {{addressed in the}} paper. Such structures consist of an assemblage of <b>cantilever</b> <b>columns</b> connected with ties. Considering analogy with cantilever walls, it has been expected that during inelastic response the actual shear forces in multi-storey <b>cantilever</b> <b>columns</b> could be considerably higher than the forces foreseen by traditional equivalent elastic analytical procedures (equivalent lateral force or modal spectrum). A parametric study {{of a set of}} realistic three-storey structures/columns was performed. These structures were designed according to Eurocodes and shear forces were determined by the equivalent elastic (modal spectrum) analysis. Average values of the shear forces obtained by the inelastic response analysis were compared to those of the traditional (modal spectrum) procedure. They were also compared to magnified shear forces predicted using the shear magnification factor ε suggested in Eurocode 8 for RC ductile walls. In parallel, modelling issues related to the inelastic response analysis of multi-storey <b>cantilever</b> <b>columns</b> were also discussed. Very large seismic force magnifications (up to 3 times and more) were observed. Therefore it is essential to account for this phenomenon in the seismic (capacity) design of <b>cantilever</b> <b>columns</b> in multi-storey precast buildings. It was demonstrated that for this purpose the expression given in Eurocode 8 to account for seismic shear magnification in ductile cantilever walls could be used with some minor modifications...|$|R

The convergence is assessed with the inelastic response of a steel-concrete composite substructure under uniaxial loading. The accuracy of the formulations is assessed by correlating the numerical results with experimental data from a steel-concrete composite substructure under uniaxial loading and from the biaxial response of two reinforced concrete (RC) <b>cantilever</b> <b>columns.</b> The correlation studies confirm the accuracy and numerical robustness of the mixed formulations for global response measures such as the force-displacement relation and for local response measures such as the strain and relative slip distributions in the composite member.
